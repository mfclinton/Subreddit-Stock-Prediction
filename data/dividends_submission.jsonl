{"name": "t3_6gy834", "title": "Dividend Investing Through These Two Investments", "text": "In today’s article, we are going to talk about the best way to invest your money. I’m not going to bore you with tons of facts, figures and examples. But rather, give you a fast and quick method on how to invest your money right, the fast way the right way.\r\n\r\nSTEP 1 Now let’s get one thing straight, if you are in debts; that is, if you still owe money to a bank, to a person, to whatever entity, you got to pay it down first. Especially debts with high interest rates. Pay them off as soon as you can! Once you are ‘relatively’ debt free (I highlight the word relative because I leverage on low interest debt to invest-more details on this later) you will need to\r\n\r\nSTEP 2 Automate your savings account. Why? Well because it is the best way to help you financially deal with the uncertainties of life (such as job loss or medical expenses) and give you ammunition to achieve your financial dreams (pay for college, purchase a car, travel, or save for retirement).\r\nRemember to pay yourself first! Depositing money into a savings account should take priority over any additional spending.\r\nHere are some ideas to help: \r\n· As you pay your monthly bills, set money aside to deposit into your savings. \r\n· Ask your bank to automatically transfer money from your checking to your savings once or twice a month. \r\n· Request a direct deposit from your employer for a portion of your paycheck to be deposited into your savings account.\r\n\r\nMake sure you are not spending more than you earn and that you are able to save money every month. Ultimately, you should maintain a balance that would at least cover six to 12 months of your expenses. Small amounts add up and make a difference over time.\r\n\r\nSTEP 3\r\nStart to ride on the power of compounding. I am talking about real investing. Not trading, not finding the next best stock or company that promises to give you huge returns and if it doesn’t you dumb it away…no.\r\nToo many investors have spent too much time trading and trading (in my opinion) usually lose out in the long run.\r\nSo what is ‘riding on the power of compounding actually mean? Allow me to give you an example\r\nIf you have bought Vanguard 500 Index fund (VFINX) and held this etf for the 20 years ending March 15, 2017.\r\n\r\nA $10,000 investment capital outlay in March 15, 1997 would have grown to a value of $42,700 at the end of the 20-year period. This assumes the reinvestment of all fund distributions for dividends, interest or capital gains back into the fund. Without reinvesting the distributions, the value of the initial $10,000 investment would have grown to $29,040 of the amount with reinvestment.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at more examples,\r\nA 25-year-old who wishes to accumulate $1 million before age 53 would need to invest $1000 each month assuming a constant return of 7%.\r\nA 35-year-old wishing to accumulate $1 million by before age 60 would need to invest $1,500 each month using the same assumptions.\r\nA 45-year-old would need to invest more per month in order to hit $1million before 60 and so forth.\r\nHaving seen all these examples, what does it mean to be actually riding ‘on the power of compounding interest’? It implies the following [very important part] You need to find an investment that is \r\n· Easy to understand \r\n· Easy for you to manage its risks \r\n· Able to give back to you consistently\r\nAnd you need to · Be disciplined enough to reinvest the returns \r\n· Start as soon as you can (more time for your investments to grow and weather the ups and downs of the stock market and economy)\r\n\r\nSTEP 4 The next question you should be asking is, what investment opportunities are out there that is easy to understand, easy to manage and able to give back to you consistently? They are \r\n\r\n· Index ETFs \r\n\r\n· REITs\r\n\r\nLook no further then these two investment opportunities. Why? Well because these investment give decently high CONSISTENT returns and their risks are easily managed. Different investment options offer different rates of return. Generally, the higher rate of return has higher the chance of losing your investment (the lower the rate of return, the lower the chance of losing your investment dollars) but with REITs and Index ETFs, this equivalent exchange of high return high risk can be adjusted to your favour, if you put in the find exceptional Index ETFs and top REITs to put into your portfolio.\r\n\r\nHow to find exceptional ETFs (see here: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-choose-best.asp)\r\n\r\nHow to find exceptional Top REITs (see here: https://www.udemy.com/reits-investment-money-masterclass/?couponCode=GSSDEAL)\r\n\r\nAnd that’s all.

{"name": "t3_ahe8ef", "title": "Creating Your Own Monthly Dividend Portfolio Using Popular Dividend Growth Stocks", "text": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nMy first post here (I think?)\r\n\r\nI'm sure many people on this sub are some what attracted to monthly dividend paying stocks. So I thought, since different stocks pay out dividends on different months, what if we bought just the right ones so that we're getting a dividend payment from *somewhere*, every month. \r\n\r\nAfter all, if we have total monthly expenses of, let's say...$2,000, then it'd be sweet if we somehow earned $2,000 per month in dividend payments to cover that, wouldn't it? \r\n\r\nSo we can build a portfolio of stocks with staggering monthly dividend payments in order to achieve this $2,000 per month. \r\n\r\n**So Here's What I Did:**\r\n\r\nTo start building this portfolio, my main criteria was that it should be a strong solid stock from stable, mature companies. \r\n\r\nI decided to look at [VDIGX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VDIGX) since it's the Vanguard Dividend Growth fund. \r\n\r\nFrom here, I picked out the top 25 performing stocks (which I've written about [here](https://www.financeoholic.com/dividends/dividend-stocks-portfolio/)) over the last decade and decided to build a portfolio containing just these stocks. Now I had to figure out how many of each of these stocks I should buy in order to have a consistent monthly dividend payment. This became a basic Optimization problem, which Excel can handle pretty easily.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I created a schedule of all the dividend payments by month. This was done by creating a table in Excel. With this table, I ran Excel Solver and it spit out the number of shares I would have to buy of each stock from the Top 25 stocks of VDIGX. \r\n\r\nThe resulting spreadsheet looked like this:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3ss461aj8b21.jpg?width=261&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a6836fe8f99ac164a49485094c830f32b7d7755\r\n\r\nI'm still fairly a beginner using Excel Solver and identifying constraints. So if anyone knows of more tricks out there, I'm open to listen. My spreadsheet can be downloaded here if you want to play around with the table: \r\n\r\n[https://www.financeoholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Monthly-Dividend-Portfolio-Financeoholic-v1.0.xlsx](https://www.financeoholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Monthly-Dividend-Portfolio-Financeoholic-v1.0.xlsx)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy complete post on making a [monthly dividend portfolio](https://www.financeoholic.com/dividends/monthly-dividend-portfolio/) is here if anyone wants the full read.

Profit from the divi plus the CC premium(s).  If the stock isn't called away then sell another one to collect even more premium.\r\n\r\n2) Sell a cash-secured put (CSP) ATM and expiring the Friday before the ex-date.  This brings in a very nice premium, most times more than the divi.  If assigned sell an ATM or ITM CC for another premium. This profits from the put premium plus the divi and the call premium.  In some cases, the call expires without the stock being called away so another CC can be sold for a higher return.  \r\n\r\nNote that if the CSP expires OTM then the trade just keeps the put premium and closes.\r\n\r\nThe downside is the stock dropping unexpectedly and the premiums collected will help lower the net stock cost so this can be minimal.  Also, it is a good idea to get the stock closed prior to any earning report.\r\n\r\nI just bought WDC and collected the divi plus the stock rose from the time I bought it so I sold CCs above the net stock cost so got that plus the premium.

If one examines the average rate of growth on ABBV's dividend since its split from Abbot in 2013, ABBV is growing the dividend at around 18% per year (18.16% is the number I came up with).  This does include a Jan 2018 - Jan 2019 increase of 50%, which is an outlier, and removing that increase from the calculation results in an 11.8% increase year over year (on average).  \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI arrived at these numbers by determining the % increase between each year, and averaging the resulting percentage increases together (as an aside, is this a good way of determining average dividend growth?). \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAbbot has a smaller year over year increase, around 9% on average each year over 20 years, but since the starting yield if the stock were purchased today is smaller, it does not result in the mammoth possible dividend gains that ABBV does.  However, these were once the same company, and I am wondering if it would be prudent to examine Abbot's dividend growth as part of ABBV's for the years in which the companies were one.  \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nIf I include Abbot's dividend increases as part of ABBV's in order to get 15 year history, the average annual dividend growth rate is 12.69%, 10.02% if we remove the outlier (2018-2019).  I did not include any calculation for Abbot's dividend payment in 2012 as it relates to ABBV's first dividend payment in 2013.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAssuming I'm not missing something huge in the way that I am calculating the annual growth, this is still a pretty great dividend growth rate in my opinion, especially with ABBV's current starting yield after the dip. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions on whether or not this rate of growth is sustainable long term?  Taking the lowest of the above figures (10.02% annual dividend growth), one could get a 39% yield on cost in 20 years, not counting reinvested dividends.  Do you think this is sustainable?

I'm doubling my money every 6.53 years.\r\n\r\nThis is the 11th month with a total above $100, with September, 2018 being the last month below that threshold.\r\n\r\nI've been learning a lot and listening to the Financial Velociraptor, and I've also been doing a lot of research into the stocks that I'm tracking.  I think it's time to change things up a bit.  I've been focused on yield, wanting to reach escape velocity as quickly as possible, but the returns that I have been getting, while impressive, are also disappointing if you look at total portfolio value.  Now, I don't pay all that much attention to capital gains, because I am a buy and hold forever investor, but what the Raptor has told me about Dividend Growth investing makes a lot of sense.  So I started plugging in numbers for 1,2,5, and 10 year Dividend Growth and 1,2,5, and 10 year Stock Performance.  Gotta love spreadsheets with a ranking function, because it becomes easy enough to come up with a way to rank all of these securities against each other in many different ways.  If you take the ranking numbers and average them out, the best ranked stocks for all of these categories float to the top.  Here's the list of the top 10 ranked Dividend Growth stocks, based on the research that I've done so far.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nBA\r\n\r\nHD\r\n\r\nTXN\r\n\r\nCMCSA\r\n\r\nAVGO\r\n\r\nJPM\r\n\r\nQCLN\r\n\r\nNEE\r\n\r\nMSFT\r\n\r\nDDF\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI still have a lot of research to do, so that top 10 list will change as I plug in more and more numbers.  But it's a pretty solid list of stocks, and anyone who has held those stocks over the last 10 years has seen an impressive increase in the dividends they have been getting.\r\n\r\nDoing the same thing with stock performance gives a different list:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSUI\r\n\r\nAVGO\r\n\r\nMSFT\r\n\r\nCOST\r\n\r\nMCD\r\n\r\nHD\r\n\r\nNEE\r\n\r\nTXN\r\n\r\nAXP\r\n\r\nABT\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThere is some overlap here, so let's combine these two measures and come up with a list that shows the best stocks for dividend growth AND stock performance.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAVGO\r\n\r\nHD\r\n\r\nTXN\r\n\r\nBA\r\n\r\nMSFT\r\n\r\nCMCSA\r\n\r\nNEE\r\n\r\nMCD\r\n\r\nABT\r\n\r\nAAPL\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nRemember, I have almost 600 stocks on my list, but with the numbers I have collected so far, this last list of 10 are extremely solid stocks that will likely grow their dividends and their stock value over the next few years.  A portfolio based on these would likely perform very well against the S&P 500.  No guarantees of course, past performance vs. future etc.  But the question is what should I do with this information.  How should I adjust my purchases to make use of this new ranking system?\r\n\r\nRight now my overall dividend yield is 11.86%.  That's EXTREMELY high, and I've joked with friends that I call my strategy \"Walking on Hot Coals\".  I've been doing this for almost 10 years, focused on high yield stocks, ignoring the advice of wiser investors, and built a portfolio that terrifies many of them.  I like the fact that the dividends I have received in total exceeds the amount of cash that I have put into my portfolio, but that might be a good time to change things.  I think 10% is a good overall yield to strive for in the long term, and I think finding a balance between walking on hot coals and building a solid foundation is something I can do.  So, here's the new strategy;\r\n\r\nIf my yield within a portfolio is less than 10%, I will continue to buy solid high dividend stocks, ETF's, REITs, etc.  I have always done the research on whether the dividends are likely going to keep paying based on cash flow, the type of business, and REITs are a great source for that kind of high yield strategy because real estate investments are very solid and they are under obligation to pay out 90% of their profits anyway.\r\n\r\nBut if my yield within a portfolio is higher than 10% it's time to step back from that strategy and let the accumulated dividends go towards the purchase of high ranked dividend growth and performance stocks that will net me a stronger portfolio over the long term.  These are the stocks that are likely recession proof, their market capitalization is in the hundreds of billions of dollars each, and they'll be able to weather the storm that is coming.\r\n\r\nSo that's how I'm going to reach my balance point, sticking with the goal of an overall yield of 10%.  It may take longer to gather up the money I need to make a purchase, but I remember those days and I think I can resist the temptation.  I'll plug away for a few months and let everyone know how it goes.\r\n\r\nDevour your prey, Raptors!", "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "created_utc": 1567267221.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_dmgv8q", "title": "Well-performing stocks to hold when starting portfolio? BPY-UN.TO (BPY Nasdaq)? BAC? MO? Or simply start with Dividend Aristocrats?", "text": "   Hey all. 22 year old university student studying business in Canada, majoring in Economics and Finance. In my corporate finance course, we've recently been learning how to value stocks and bonds using different methods. Specifically, how to calculate revenue flows from the face value of bonds and their coupon rates, as well as stock prices based on the intrinsic value an investor places in a company and the dividends received. I've always know this is how the stocks are valued on the market, but haven't had the proper framework of thinking to fully understand this. My father used to tell me often about the power of compounding interest, over and over giving me the \"double a penny every day for 2 months or flat sum\" story, and it hasn't been until now that I've truly realized what that could equate to me personally. That is, if I put in the effort and show the discipline. \r\n\r\n   I've always been a major believer in accumulating wealth and allowing that wealth to work for you. Unfortunately, however, I haven't found the drive or necessity to make that happen for myself. After investing in my education, working hard at a serving position many days during school, and reducing my expenses as much as possible, I am fully committed to setting myself up for success. \r\n\r\n   I currently have about $1000 CAD to start a portfolio, and I have the intention of putting 70% of my tips accrued throughout the month into the portfolio moving forward. This will equate to about $600 CAD a month ($75x3days/week= $225 ; $225x.7 = $157.50 \\~\\~ $150). I've done a heavy amount of research into which investment style fits my personality and habits best, and the dividend growth method best suits my traits. Day-trading and swing trading feel more like informed (or uninformed, depending on your knowledge level) gambling. Although I do consider myself a risk-taker, I don't believe I have the experience and fortitude to tolerate the short-term, volatile goals of these strategies. I do have school to pay off, but my desire is to grow this portfolio as much as financially possible before I start accruing interest on my loans in just about 2 1/2 years. And to do this, I can't lose all of my assets invested due to my own lack of knowledge or insight.\r\n\r\n   Now, I've done a fair amount of research into which stocks offer good yields, have good growth and have compiled a few watch-lists based on the criteria I've outlined. Thanks to a few accounting courses, I can pretty easily find my watch through reported balance sheets, income statements, etc. and have a good understanding of what to look for on these documents. BPY seems like a solid company, with international holdings, a strong investor backing and a forward yield of 6.82%. The only thing that seems to be a bit concerning to me is their assets-to-liabilities, which tells me they could face tight liquidity issues if they do not maintain their rental fees.\r\n\r\n   Is this concerning enough to stay away, or is a this a good buy to hold for the future? Options I've looked at is Bank of America Corporation, Visa, Alteria Group, and others listed as dividend aristocrats, as well as quite a few REITS and MLP's.  Am I better of going with ONLY these guaranteed, proven winners, or should I feel confident with companies that pass my own analysis as well as diversify myself with these All-Stars?\r\n\r\n   The platforms I've chosen are SimpleWealth Trade due to their commisionless service and IB for their history of being a cheap, trusted broker in Canada. I am using OptionsAlpha free, yahoo finance and finvis to supplement SimpleWealth's lack of analysis tools.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: What the title says. I have $1000 CAD AKA Pond Scum, which stocks should I buy to start my dividend investing journey?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any answers, tips or wisdom!", "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "created_utc": 1571925868.0, "tickers": [["BPY", 1]]}

What I don't get is if an index fund/stock grows more than a high-paying dividend fund/stock, then why not own the index fund now, cash out later when it can be transferred to high dividend-paying stocks, then you get the best initial growth while trading it out for cash flow later? \r\n\r\nAssuming you can't live off your dividends or other investments yet, then you have to continue earning an income and contributing to your portfolio anyway. During that time, having the dividends come in doesn't help that process more than the typical gains on an index fund. Or is it possible that the total return of a high dividend-paying stock/fund can beat a typical index fund anyway?\r\n\r\nMaybe it's foolish to compare only two particular stocks and I'm comparing apples to oranges, but the Vanguard high-dividend paying ETF (VYM) sits at 9% annual return over the last 5 yr period @ ~3.3% dividend yield, while Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) had annuals returns of 10.7% over the last 5 yr period @ ~2.1% dividend yield. Which is a 1.7% gap in annual returns. 2.1% when you include distribution taxes on both ETFs. \r\n\r\nOf course this ignores tax on eventually selling your index fund rather than holding a high-dividend stock like VYM forever, which may actually negate any of the S&P 500's additional gains.\r\n\r\nI'm speaking at the absolute limits of my financial intelligence here so I'm sure I'm messing up something in my example and missing a key concept here ... what is it? I also understand that when you do eventually sell an index fund you may have to wait years to time the market and get out into something that can provide more cash flow.... is it that along with the earlier mentioned tax which is the real detriment to holding an index fund rather than dividend stocks?", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1572851567.0, "tickers": []}

This means I've hit the $1000/month milestone!\r\n\r\nTotal portfolio value as of right now: $475,456.55\r\n\r\nI totally love dividend growth. My best stock purchases were good companies that had their stock price beaten down. Like T, MMM, ABBV, CVS, MO -- they can give me some very nice principal growth, not just dividend growth. When good companies are on sale, I buy as much as I can! And there's \\*always\\* something on sale.\r\n\r\nMy largest holding is T, at about $15,000 -- which is only about 3% of my portfolio, since I like to be very well diversified.\r\n\r\nI also have a lot of REITs like O, KIM, SPG. O is kind of expensive now but it's just such a good company. My worse buy is SKT, which is down to $16 now, since I bought it at $24. I'm buying more now that it's lower, since I think it's still a good company.\r\n\r\nNot all of my portfolio is dividend-payers -- I also own some tech companies, like OKTA, AMZN, AMD, BABA -- these just get me exposure to possible growth. AMD has been my best buy so far, since I bought it at $12, and it's now $38.\r\n\r\nI have over 60 holdings. I accumulated so many because I just really like buying things when they go on sale. And usually that's only a small window of time when good companies are on sale. Then, when the price goes back to normal, I don't buy any more. I just keep the stock, collect divs, and look for other companies on sale. Maybe 60 companies is too many, and I should consolidate some of the more mediocre ones.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to be on this dividend journey with you all!", "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1573972338.0, "tickers": [["MO", 1], ["O", 1], ["BABA", 1], ["AMD", 1]]}

Typically, I will receive the $100 a few weeks after the ex-dividend date.\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n\r\n\\- If I buy the stock the day before the ex-dividend date, is there a certain amount of time I need to hold it in order to qualify for the dividend? So if I buy stock X on 12/19, can I sell it on 12/20 (the ex-dividend date) and receive the dividend? Or do I need to wait a day to sell it (12/21)? Or do I need to wait longer, and if so, how long?\r\n\r\n\\- I'm assuming I can sell after the ex-dividend date and receive the dividend yield (let me know if this isn't correct). If I cycle between many stocks and do this with 2 stocks a week for example, I would be able to turn a decent profit, assuming I invested in very high dividend yield stocks. Will this strategy work? Am I missing something? I understand the potential cons are waiting a few weeks to receive the dividends and/or if the stock share drops a significant amount on its ex-dividend date.

{"name": "t3_etqd4o", "title": "Baseline Stock: Is it better than Coke (KO)?", "text": "So, as some of you know, im new to dividends and learning a lot here. thank you for everyones help.\r\n\r\nCoke (KO) for me, seems to be a slow steady stock. very consistent in payouts, always raising dividends for 50+ years. Its not just a dividend aristocrat, but its in the KING category. You cant go \"wrong\" with Coke. It can ride through recessions, and keeps climbing. slowly.\r\n\r\nyou may have also seen some of my experiments: I randomly purchase or not purchase stock, every market day, from a certain year. and see what my returns would be today.\r\n\r\nTICKER   return\\_on\\_capital + return\\_on\\_dividends = total\\_return\r\n\r\nKO   112.65% + 1.63% = 114.28%    year=2019  <== started buying in 2019\r\n\r\nKO   119.01% + 3.32% = 122.34%   year=2018\r\n\r\nKO   122.68% + 5.17% = 127.84%   year=2017\r\n\r\nKO   124.98% + 6.80% = 131.78%    year=2016\r\n\r\nKO   127.45% + 8.48% = 135.93%    year=2015\r\n\r\nKO   148.91% + 20.56% = 169.46%    year=2010\r\n\r\nKO   192.22% + 42.35% = 234.58%    year=2000 <== started buying in 2000\r\n\r\nthe randomness is important. Its to show what would happen if i DO NOT try to time the market. Sometimes i buy high, and sometimes i buy low. Who knows, who cares. for now.\r\n\r\nSo if you started buying in 2000, you would be up on average 234% (not dripping). with little volatility. Theres a very good chance your results would be similar.\r\n\r\nSo now, when i ask ,\"Is this (XXX) a good stock?\" well..compared to what? So now im comparing to Coke. If it hasn't beat grandpa Coke historically, it has a high probability it won't do it in the future.\r\n\r\nThen i thought, what stocks (paying dividends) would probably have done better than KO? What about WALMART?\r\n\r\nWMT   105.77% + 0.97% = 106.74%    year=2019\r\n\r\nWMT   114.19% + 2.10% = 116.29%    year=2018\r\n\r\nWMT   122.74% + 3.34% = 126.08%    year=2017\r\n\r\nWMT   130.98% + 4.72% = 135.70%    year=2016\r\n\r\nWMT   136.12% + 6.13% = 142.24%    year=2015\r\n\r\nWMT   153.06% + 13.15% = 166.21%   year=2010\r\n\r\nWMT   180.84% + 25.05% = 205.90%    year=2000\r\n\r\nCoke, actually returned more than Walmart. Not saying WALMART is a bad stock. i don't think it is. Its just that WALMART has similar volatility, and returned less. Less than Coke. And if you goal is to live off of dividends, KO returned more in dividends, over the same period.\r\n\r\nLets look at one of our favorites, O - Realty Income Corp.\r\n\r\nO   107.10% + 1.90% = 109.00%    year=2019\r\n\r\nO   120.42% + 4.22% = 124.64%    year=2018\r\n\r\nO   124.14% + 6.35% = 130.49%   year=2017\r\n\r\nO   124.80% + 8.58% = 133.38%   year=2016\r\n\r\nO   130.62% + 11.07% = 141.69%    year=2015\r\n\r\nO   157.77% + 24.76% = 182.52%   year=2010\r\n\r\nO   248.19% + 75.00% = 323.18%    year=2000\r\n\r\nComparing O and KO, Coke actually is winning in 2019. Then slowly falls back. O appears to give better average Returns over the long haul. But we need to keep in mind that O is way more volatile than KO. Its a REIT, so its taxed as ordinary income, instead of KO's qualified status.\r\n\r\nOnce you find companies that have performed historically BETTER than Coke (based on your personal criteria), then you would have to look DEEPLY into the company data to see if they are on track to continue performing in the future.\r\n\r\nI post this to get feedback. To see if my thinking is flawed. Any and all suggestions are welcome, appreciated and desired. Especially if they conflict with my own.\r\n\r\nthanks for your help.\r\n\r\nEdit: added a header.", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "created_utc": 1579956388.0, "tickers": [["O", 4], ["KO", 1]]}

For some reason, the broker I use tends to use “Receive Cash” as a default. I will try to add that $5.88 to the February 28, 2020 $1000 investment (btw, I will be investing $1,000 into GOOD on February 28), but it will be difficult because that will result only in a fraction of a share.\r\n\r\n**Learn from me: Don’t forget to engage the DRIP!**\r\n\r\nI expect the February 28, 2020 payment to be $11.64. The $5.76 jump is mostly due to $1,000 of external capital that was invested on January 31, 2020.

Little back story, I'm 27 yrs old and have been investing on and off since I was 18 Yrs old. By the time I was 19 yrs old I had $20,000 invested with about $6600 in BNS, ENB and BCE all enrolled in DRIPS.\r\n\r\nFast forward a hot minute and I became impatient quickly with the lack of excitement and slow movement so I pulled my then $30,000 (not all gains, I kept adding to my TFSA) and stumbled upon the up and coming marijuana industry. I did day trades, got approved for options, and messed around unknowingly gambling for about 4 years and ended up doubling my money to $60,000.\r\n\r\nBy pure luck I was at the point in my life where it was a good time for me to buy a house so I liquidated 100% of my investments and had just enough for 20% down on my current home. This just so happened to be right before legalization when the marijuana market to its big first hit.\r\n\r\nI thought I was hot shit and could read the market like a god... I was so wrong and it took a little over a year being out of the market to realize how lucky I was.\r\n\r\nIf I had of left my original drips alone in the beginning and just kept adding the $500 a month as planned the account would be sitting around the 100K mark or more today.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I just started back in the market this week with my first purchase of 80 shares in BCE. As seen in the picture my plan is to max out my TFSA as quickly as possible buying a new stock every-time I have $2500 saved away.

There're other posts just massacring dividend stocks as an investment strategy for cutting or suspending payments due to COVID19.\r\n\r\nThe husband and I earned approx. $4650 a month on dividend payments. The investment portfolio value is approx 650k with a yield of an average of 8.5% (a combination of income funds, ETFs, REITs, regular stocks). we use the dividend payments to pay all our living expenses and continue to invest with my husband's salary. I quit my corporate job in 2019 and he works for a major Airline (btw we're in Canada)we're obviously worried about how all of the shutdowns to business would affect this situation. living off of passive income from dividends is something we work towards during our GRIND phase and now it was all put into question!! We know an 8.5% yield is a bit risky, but we're still young and practicing the passive income investing strategy of buy and hold.At it's worse our total investment value dropped 30%!! but the good news is that surprisingly almost all our dividends paid out and we're still living off dividends.  The dividend cuts we experience represented 18%, ($VET -Vermilion Energy, was the biggest chunk)\r\n\r\nTherefore, returning us approx $3850 in dividend payouts instead of the $4650.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just wanted to share a personal story of living off of Dividends during the COVID19 pandemic. The husband and I created a Youtube channel during the two-week quarantine about Passive Income Investing. In the videos, he shares our complete portfolio and talks on each investment, since he's been in research mode the entire time we've been working and saving. Every month we'd look forward to which fund or ETF, or REIT to invest in. We'd do the research and really understand their business. This is mainly because early on we were with our parent's financial advisors, who made the simplest safest investment and charged a hefty management fee. A bit of light reading made us understand how we could do it ourselves for a fraction of that management fee AND get comfortable with a little higher risk tolerance. We're both noobs to creating videos, but passionate about reaching people to help them get comfortable and knowledgeable about passive income investing don't want to self promote on the post so DM me if you're interested in the link to the Youtube Channel.\r\n\r\n Edit: Thanks for all your interest.

( $0.65 per quarter X 4 times a year ) / $317 stock price\r\n\r\nBut we are long term investors. (Yes we are! say it to yourself 100 times in the mirror, every day! ha!). So lets look just a little bit deeper, especially the dividend growth.\r\n\r\nLast year, Costco increased their dividend 14.04%. the year before that 14%, before that 11.11%..\r\n\r\nAnnual Dividend Growth: 14.04%, 14%, 11.11%, 12.50%, 12.68%, 14.52%, 12.73%, 14.58%, 17.07%, 13.89%\r\n\r\nthe 5 year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is 12.86%\r\n\r\nNow we have 2 variables, the initial buy in dividend yield, and its 5 year CAGR. 0.82% and 12.86%. So, is that good? dunno. Lets try to compare it to something we like, like $KO Coke.\r\n\r\n$KO Coke, has an initial buy in dividend yield of 3.41%! very good for coke! Its generally not in the 3% range! Last time it was in the 4% range was during the 2008 meltdown. Its a Dividend Aristocrat, paying and increasing dividends for 50+ years!\r\n\r\nBut its growth is dwindling:\r\n\r\nAnnual Dividend Growth: 2.50%, 2.56%, 5.41%, 5.71%, 6.06%, 8.20%, 8.93% 9.8%, 8.51%, 6.82%\r\n\r\nthe 5 year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is 4.44%\r\n\r\nits 2 variables are 3.41% initial buy in dividend yield, and 4.44% CAGR.\r\n\r\nSo, which of these two stocks are \"better\"?  dunno..too many numbers, giving me a headache :)\r\n\r\nLets figure out how many years it would take for the stock to reach a 10% annual dividend yield! \r\n\r\nCOSTCO: at 12.86% CAGR, starting at 0.82%, it will take 21 years.\r\n\r\nCOKE: at 4.44% CAGR, starting at 3.41%, it will take 25 years.\r\n\r\nIf you bought COSTCO on 2004-05-06, for $36.30, it paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10, which is an initial buy in dividend yield of 1.1%.. still not on our radar.. but TODAY, you would be receiving a 7.16% dividend yield.. \r\n\r\nIf you bought COKE on 2004-06-15, for $51.38 (non adjusted), it paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 (non adjusted), which is an initial buy in dividend yield of 1.95%.. but TODAY, you would be receiving 6.38% dividend yield.\r\n\r\nThat was 16 years ago, and the forecast seems sorta accurate. That in 6-9 more years,  they would hit approx 10%.\r\n\r\nWe essentially distilled the stocks 2 variables into one number (the number of years it takes to hit 10%). And based on **JUST THIS INFORMATION**, Costco wins, by a tad. \r\n\r\nSo, although many of us dividend investors screens stocks based on their initial annual dividend yield, we could be missing out on companies that start with a lower yield, but with amazing dividend growth.", "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "created_utc": 1587381209.0, "tickers": [["X", 1], ["KO", 1], ["COKE", 1]]}

Immediately after the post some people got in touch and started using the service. While trying to prove that my algorithm gives better than the average returns on dividends, I started researching how other people/companies provide this proof and I made a discovery which was kind of shocking, most of them gave a ridiculous number without any proof, the ones who did show some trades to back up their number were only showing their winning trades and positive dividend returns, while conveniently hiding their losses. The most honest companies/Individuals who did show their returns at 8% just in dividends returns with their actual trades seemed to be the real deal but I realized that it was not actually 8%, It is true that they did make 8% in yield but they lost heavily because the actual price of the stock went down and companies to compensate for their poor stock performance were just inflating their dividend payouts, hence in reality they were making 3-4% (Which is still better than most), so I finally came to the conclusion that they only way to show that my algorithm is the real deal is to allow people to see the recommendations for free and not just once but for an extended period of time, so that they can consistently see that it  works. I even customized it to give enough options so that people can choose their returns based on their risk tolerance, portfolio diversity and capital at hand.

Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure; however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. **We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities.** However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.\r\n\r\nOn page 34 of Annual Report . General idea of how shares outstanding is growing over past 5 years. So this jump to 740k is crazy.

(EDIT: 740k is authorized.. and NOT shares outstanding, read comments for explanation)***\r\n\r\nAt December 31, 2019, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loans, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $7.9 billion, or approximately 24.4% of our total market capitalization of $32.5 billion.\r\n\r\nDec, 2019: Shares of our common stock outstanding of 333,619,106, plus total common units outstanding of 463,119, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $73.63per share on December 31, 2019, or $24.6 billion;\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders (page 42)**\r\n\r\nWe have continued our 51-year policy of paying monthly dividends. In addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2019 and twice in 2020. As of February 2020, we have paid 89 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 105 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.\r\n\r\n***Why increase the dividend amount so many times in 2019? Maybe they feel bad about doubling the shares and we didn't get anything?***\r\n\r\nAlso in January 2020, we announced that Paul Meurer, our EVP, **Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, is leaving the company.** To ensure a smooth transition, Mr. Meurer will serve as a senior advisor to the company through March 31, 2020.

One post today mentions $WBA. I've seen it especially with tobacco and alcohol stocks, $BUD and $MO are examples here.\r\n\r\nWhy is this?\r\n\r\nAre we expected to dollar cost average in at every opportunity and pray for a spike when ready to sell?\r\n\r\nOr maybe need to sell out after dividend issued, before market corrects and buy back in?

The first quarter dividend will be paid on June 30, 2020 in a combination of **cash and shares** of the Company's common stock to stockholders of record as of May 21, 2020. Given the uncertain and rapidly changing financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's board of directors has determined that the cash component of the first quarter dividend (other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) **will not exceed 10% in the aggregate, or $0.05 per share**, with the balance payable in shares of the Company's common stock. This will allow the Company to preserve capital and enhance the Company's financial flexibility.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of the applicable IRS Revenue Procedures, stockholders will be asked to make an election to receive the first quarter dividend all in cash or all in shares. To the extent that stockholders elect to receive more than 10% of the aggregate payment in cash, the cash portion of the payment will be prorated. **Stockholders who elect to receive the dividend in cash will receive a cash payment of at least $0.05 per share**. Stockholders who elect to receive the dividend in Company common stock will only receive shares of Company common stock. **Additionally, stockholders who do not make an election will receive 90% of the dividend in Company common stock and 10% of the dividend payment in cash.** The number of shares issued as a result of the dividend will be calculated based upon the volume weighted average trading prices of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on June 17, June 18 and June 19, 2020. **Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares so that stockholders receive a whole number of shares of common stock.**\r\n\r\n[https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/news/article?dockey=100-132p4891-1](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/news/article?dockey=100-132p4891-1)", "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "created_utc": 1589290088.0, "tickers": [["IVZ", 1], ["CASH", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_gn1t5r", "title": "Moving away from passively investing to trying to take control of my finances", "text": "Redditors/\r\n(33M) Looking for investment advice. I have been passively investing for years and have accumulated a reasonable amount of money in various types of investment vehicles. During this pandemic, I have taken a vested interest in how my money was ‘working’ for me, however, with all these investment vehicles, it has proven to be quite challenging to decide how/if I should consolidate. This is coupled with the fact that I really don’t understand them all and was blindly saving. This probably cost me a lot of money over the years.\r\n\r\nSo, here is a breakdown:\r\n\r\n401 (K) – Current Value: $60K Traditional and Roth with company match\r\n\r\nBefore: Maxing 401 (K) Contributions in Traditional 401(K)\r\n· 70% Target Date fund\r\n· 20% S&P Index Equity Fund\r\n· 10 % Employee Stock Ownership Plan Fund (Aerospace and Defense Company)\r\n \r\nAfter: Maxing 401 (K) contributions with mix of 8% Pre-tax and 11% Roth (total of $19,500/year)\r\n· 60% S&P Index Equity fund\r\n· 30% ESOP Fund\r\n· 10% Target Date fund\r\n \r\nPlan:  Keep current mixed contributions with 60/30 split going into S&P and ESOP because they have a low expense ratio (0.03%). Performance seems solid to me. I want to transfer the 10% Target Date Fund to a Self-Directed Brokerage Account (SDBA) from the employee 401 (K) and push it into VTI/VIG. The other options in the 401(K) is not worth investing in.\r\n \r\nThrift Savings Plan - Current Value: $15K Pre-tax Contribution.\r\n\r\nBefore: - No longer able to contribute- Had this since 2008\r\n\r\n· 100% G-Fund (Bonds)\r\n \r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n· 60% C-Fund – S&P 500 Index\r\n· 40% S-Fund – DOW Jones Total Stock Market Index\r\n \r\nPlan: The net expense of this is 0.04%. I plan on keeping it in here, however, for easier management I might move it over to the new IRA SDBA account and invest in similar Index Funds.\r\n\r\nMutual Funds – Current Value ~$100K (Brokerage account)\r\n\r\nAfter: No contributions since 2015\r\n· 6.8% PRWCX – Capital Appreciation Fund\r\n· 9.9% PRMTX - Communications & Technology\r\n· 22.5% PRHSX – Health Sciences\r\n· 26.8% PRWAX – New America Growth Fund\r\n· 23.8% PRNHX – New Horizons Fund\r\n· 10.2% OTCFX – Small-Cap Stock Fund\r\n \r\nPlan: I haven’t contributed anything to these mutual funds since 2015 after an initial investment of ~$45K. It grew in value based on dividends (avg. $600/year) and capital gain distributions (avg. $6000/year) which gets reinvested to their respective funds. Honestly, I just realized that I’ve been paying capital gain taxes of around 15%-20% on these distributions every year. This is what really prompted me to seek help. Should I slowly move these over to a traditional IRA for tax purposes? Between me and my wife we should be able to individually contribute $6K each/year. Please correct if my assumption is wrong. Our Adjusted Gross Income this year will be less than $193K.\r\n \r\nOther Investments:\r\nNow: Current hold shares of $AAPL (10), $DAL(230), and $VIG (54) in a regular brokerage account. Sold off $TSLA a couple of weeks ago, and plan on buying some $JPM, $VTI, $VIG through IRA SDBA account.\r\n \r\nOverall Goal:\r\nI want to accumulate enough dividend income to retire off, however, I would like to take advantage of growth investments. I’m currently saving around 30% of my paycheck into 401(K) and HSA. Emergency fund is greater $30K, probably too much in my opinion because I don’t have large expenses (house is paid-off). So, I can probably save/invest an additional 10-20% of my income. I'm okay if you guys tell me to go back to the drawing board and redo everything. It doesn’t look like I’m very diversified- majority of my current investment is in US stocks.

{"name": "t3_grpelw", "title": "Stocks are going up, but for how long?", "text": "Disclaimer: This post is purely speculative. \r\n\r\nAs of the current pandemic, stocks have plummeted to lows we haven’t seen in a decade during a historically great bull market. Companies giving out dividends have slowed and some have cut them entirely with the possibility of them being restored being unknown; however, the markets have been going up for nearly a month or so and seem to continue to be climbing. Along with an increasingly healthy stock market, it is possible that companies who lowered or outright cut their dividends could soon bring them back to where they were prior to 2020. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind, anyone who has invested for a notable amount of time should know that the stock market will always have ups and downs and is not entirely tied to the health of the economy. It is true that the stock market CAN be an indicator of the overall health of the economy, but is absolutely an entirely separate entity. Just because stores and companies (in the U.S. at least) are slated to begin reopening does not necessarily mean that, financially speaking, we will see an increased upturn in stocks. \r\n\r\nSo what should we expect? Personally I could see stocks soar by perhaps 10% on average throughout the summer, maybe even more. But keep in mind that 2020 is an election year and nearly every election brings uncertainty in the markets. Normally roughly a week or so surrounding the election sees some stocks plummet and others rise with an eventual correction.\r\n\r\nHonestly I forgot where I was going with this post as I was typing it, but do keep in mind these points as you continue to invest. It is still a good time to buy stocks, and those companies who have continued to pay out their normal dividends (I have LEG, RIO, and KO for example) should be considered highly valuable due to them having the ability to maintain success and viability despite everything else happening right now. \r\n\r\nWhat do you expect from the stock market throughout the remainder of the year?

It was high level and strategic, and people (myself included) wanted lower level details. So I wrote this. Maybe it will help someone.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvesting history\r\n\r\nI have been investing for 30 years, mostly growth stocks and mutual funds. Took some big hits in '00 to '02, 50% loss one year. I avoided most of the '08 crash (got out with a 10% loss), the following bull market (only 20% in), and the March crash. For the last three months I have been moving my investments to earn dividends. I also control my wife's investments. She was 100% cash into the last crash, got lucky changing brokerages at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSavings\r\n\r\nOut of college we both worked and saved 10% of our salaries, after a few years she stayed home to raise three kids (for 18 years), she got back to work four years ago. I cut back 401k savings for five years and withdrew some 401k funds to pay off the house early. We both are back to saving 10% now. We both earn over $100k per year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial summary\r\n\r\nThe two of us have put in $410k, and are getting $25,500 per year in dividends. This is $2,125 per month (averaged out, $1.2 to $2.6k is the range). We are earning 6.2% on our money. \r\n\r\n\r\nInvestments \r\n\r\nHalf of the funds are in dividend ETFs. About 10% are in dividend aristocrats or champions. I have 5% in gold, miners, and a flyer on $VTIQ. The rest could be considered \"chasing yields\" at some level. That is not popular here, and I may be about to learn another lesson the hard way, but it is working so far. I started with conservative investments then got more and more risky (chasing  yields).\r\n\r\nThe largest single investment is $MMP, at 8.6% of the portfolio. The most in one sector is oil at 11.2% of the portfolio. We have 30 different investments overall, and I am not typing them out.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n\r\nStock values are all up except $DHT. Oil is way up. That is good in case dividends are cut and I need to sell (at a profit) but it doesn't really matter. I am in this for income. I started with a goal of $12k per year and kept moving more funds into dividends. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan\r\n\r\nI plan on retiring in seven years. All the kids will be out of college. These dividends have bumped my retirement income by at least 25%. It will be 50% of my retirement income early on, before social security kicks in.\r\n\r\nI am not using DRIP but taking the funds and buying other dividend stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nManaging\r\n\r\nI have an excel sheet I track the portfolio with and analyze new investments. I use Yahoo Finance (website), TheRich (app) and TrackYourDividend (website) to help manage the portfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture\r\n\r\nKeep doing this and increasing monthly income. So far I have kept buying new funds but may want to add to funds I already have. I like the safety it gives but  30 funds is a lot. I need to figure a regular schedule to verify dividends rather than just rely on notifications and sporadic checks myself.\r\n\r\nThis is my system.

The plan is to eventually buy a house and pay the mortgage with dividends as well. I've been reading r/dividends for a while and I think getting some opinions on our dividend income plan from the community could only make it stronger, so I really appreciate you guys reading through this and poking holes or giving advice.\r\n\r\nA little bit about us: We're two young professionals in our mid to late twenties. I make 110,000 +20,000 variable bonus / year, and the partner makes 90,000 + a variable amount of RSUs a year. I am debt free and my partner only has 1600 left on their student loans.  Our rent combined is 1800/month and our utilities are usually 100-200 a month depending on the season (winter heating bills are high).\r\n\r\nBasically our total rent + utilities expenses are essentially 2000/month max, or 24,000 a year.\r\n\r\nI tried to diversify our dividend plan by industry and weight towards stocks I felt more comfortable with based on their history and price volatility. I assumed that everything we buy will be put on a DRIP for the next 3-4 years so our number of shares that we own should snowball over time. I included some stocks we already owned in the plan (like $AAPL and $ADI) since they do pay some dividend, even though its kind of low. I also tried to include stocks that had cheaper prices (prices lower than 100) so we could buy more shares every month. We're planning on investing 3000-4000 dollars a month in the below plan: \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n|Ticker|Industry|Price (as of mid dayish 6/5/2020)|% Dividend|Goal # of Shares to Own|Goal Annual Profit from Dividends|Cost of Goal # of Shares|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|$VZ|Telecom|57.74|4.30|3000|$7,448.46|$173,220.00|\r\n|$O|Real Estate|62.21|4.65|2200|$6,364.08|$136,862.00|\r\n|$KO|Beverage|49.09|3.42|2200|$3,693.53|$107,998.00|\r\n|$ADM|Food|42.52|3.5|1000|$1,488.20|$42,520.00|\r\n|$PAYX|HR Products|80.05|3.34|800|$2,138.94|$64,040.00|\r\n|$POR|Utility|47.56|3.28|800|$1,247.97|$38,048.00|\r\n|$ADI|Semiconductors|124.59|2.03|300|$758.75|$37,377.00|\r\n|$AAPL|Technology |331.5|1.02|30|$101.44|$9,945.00|\r\n|||||Totals:|$23,241.38|$610,010.00|\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAre there ways we can lower the cost or balance this better so we can make more in a smarter way?

This alone is a quality investment for passive income + growth. Great! End of research, just invest in this and we're good. But then, a couple of more clicks and we see the same Fund Manager (BMO), with a similar ETF holding the same Major Canadian Banks but this one has a dividend yield of approx 7% (ZWB as of June 1st, 2020).  As income investors, this is very interesting..\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nETF ZWB uses a covered call strategy. Before we get into what a covered call strategy is, let's look at why it exists, and why you should include them in your portfolio.\r\n\r\n# Why A Need For Covered Calls.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bloomberg reports from March 31st, 2020,  and additional sources: Forbes, MoneyShow, Investopedia\r\n\r\nThere is a steady decline in available investments that provide dividend yields. This means people are looking for new ways to access money in the marketplace, meaning there is a demand to improve strategies to make money on the stock market by enhancing dividend yields. This strategy offers investors additional income solutions to complement their portfolio and really boost dividend passive income.\r\n\r\n# Why Choose Covered Calls? \r\n\r\n* The covered call strategy is used on **Quality Dividend Growers.** These are dividend investments you already want, because of all the good reasons. (large-cap, safe, reliable, blue-chip, dividend payout steadily grows over time) \r\n* These are the investments you make for the long term and to get rich slowly while collecting income\r\n* The Covered Call strategy **Lowers Volatility** (the action taken in the strategy generates more income for the investor without subjecting investor to added risk)\r\n* The Covered Call Strategy creates **Higher Dividend Yield** (a difference of 2 or 3% is significant for income investors)\r\n* The Covered Call strategy provides **Tax Efficient** income compared to Capital Gains\r\n* The **ETF Management fee** compared to Index ETFs is well worth it for **Income Investors**\r\n\r\n# What is a Covered Call?\r\n\r\nCovered calls are a very interesting income enhancement strategy because unlike a lot of the other income enhancing strategies out there, (ex: leverage). Covered Call strategy doesn't come with additional risk, in fact, it lowers risk than just holding the securities (stocks) outright. \r\n\r\n**Covered Calls give you more yield without the added risk**\r\n\r\n## So What is it?\r\n\r\nIt's simply holding a basket of stocks (ETF) and then selling call options against some of the stocks in that portfolio (basket). What the Fund Manager does when selling a call option is they choose a price at some point in the future, and by selling that option to a potential buyer, you receive a premium. That premium is the yield enhancement to your overall portfolio.\r\n\r\n**Example:** ETF Owner (that's us) owns units of an ETF for 10$ a share Fund Manager of the ETF uses Covered Call StrategyFund Manager sells a Call Option on 100 shares in that ETF\r\n\r\nLooks like ThisCall option = For a Premium of 25 cents per share, I will sell you 100 shares at $11 a share **if** the Stock Price goes above $11 within 30 days. (Strike price here is $11)\r\n\r\n**Outcome# 1: Stock price goes down after 30 days:**Good for us the owners of the ETF as the Call Option expires worthless and we keep the premium of 25 cents per share ($25 total for this call option)Although you're not too happy the stock price goes down, you just softened the blow because at least you made a commission in the form of that Call Option Premium, plus as a passive income investor, you're glad to just hold on to the stock for the long term anyway.\r\n\r\n**Outcome# 2: Stock price stays the same after 30 days:**Good for us as the option expires worthless and we keep the premium again. ($25 for this call option )\r\n\r\n**Outcome# 3: Stock price goes up (above the strike price) after 30 days:**In this case: we are obliged to sell the stocks at the strike price, in this case, $11. But make a small profit in doing so as we bought the shares for one price and selling it at a higher price + we get the Call Option Premium. However, this can limit the potential for more upside since the stock can continue to rise (if the stock is above 11$ for example)\r\n\r\n## What's the Trade-Off?\r\n\r\nYou've traded away the excess capital gain of that stock which limits potential growth in exchange for that premium which is the enhanced income. But since ETF manager uses this strategy for large-cap, blue-chip stocks that are stable, the agreed-upon price or strike price has to be higher than the price it was at the time of the Call Option, which isn't too often as the stock is stable. \r\n\r\nIn addition, ETF managers use their own proprietary strategy to ensure some upside is captured regardless  (Example: BMO manages to capture about 50% of the upside if the option is exercised)\r\n\r\nIt sounds confusing, luckily the Fund Managers handle all of this, while we take the **Lazy Person** approach and just sit back and get enhanced income. \r\n\r\n**The Bottom Line:**This strategy is specifically tailored for **Income Investors** who are willing to trade some potential upside gain in the future for more income right now. I hope this helps to clarify was Covered Call Strategy is!", "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1592508478.0, "tickers": [["BMO", 1]]}

ETFs are usually more stable. They are of course more diversified which provides stability. They are able to provide similar dividend yields or sometimes higher than dividend stocks. Dividend ETFs do tend to have lower growth compared to the stock, but if it had a higher dividend yield, why not? \r\n\r\nWhen seeing dividend portfolios, I often see 1-2 ETFs and rest being stocks.

{"name": "t3_hgz2z1", "title": "Selling Covered Calls to Supplement Dividends and boost your CAGR.", "text": "Hi r/dividends. This is one of my favorite investing subs, but I think a lot of people here could be doing more to grow their portfolio by using covered calls so this is my little write up...\r\n\r\nIn summary, a covered call is an options trading strategy where you provide the collateral required for someone else’s call option. \r\n\r\nWhen someone buys a call option, they pay a set price called a premium that grants them the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a fixed price (strike price) and sell them for whatever the price is on a fixed date (strike date). \r\n\r\nFor example, the current price of BAC is $23.07.  An example call could be a $25c 7/2 for $0.25, meaning the contract holder has the right to buy 100 shares of BAC at $25 each and sell them at whatever price BAC is at on 7/2. Since the contract represent 100 shares, the premium paid is 100 x $0.25= $25. \r\n\r\nSo, if BAC reaches $27, the contract holder could buy and sell 100 x (27-25)= $200, but they also paid $25 for the premium so net profit is $175. However, if BAC is only $24 on 7/2 then the call option expires worthless because the strike price was not achieved and the contract holder still loses the premium they paid.\r\n\r\nNow, as a dividend investor with 100 shares of BAC myself, I can sell these call options to other people. I pick my own strike price and strike date and submit my 100 shares as collateral for a call option. In return, I get to keep the premium paid no matter what. So if I sell a $27c 7/2 and it expires worthless, I get to keep my shares and the premium the customer paid so I’m +$25 without selling any shares. \r\n\r\nAs a dividend investor, your priority is to never sell and keep collecting premiums for as long as possible, so you may want to choose strike prices and strike dates that are very far from the current price in order to ensure that you get to keep your shares. So in reality you might want to sell a $30c 7/2 for only $0.10, but it will likely expire worthless so you still net $10. \r\n\r\nI’ve been selling covered calls on my 400 shares of  BAC and have collected $120 in premiums by selling weekly contracts in just 1 month which I immediately put back into $BAC to buy 4 more shares. My total cost of 400 BAC shares is $10,000, and I yielded 120/10000= 1.2% in premiums within the month.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think of this or if you have any questions. I have a spreadsheet tracking my covered calls if there’s any interest in seeing that too.", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1593283798.0, "tickers": [["BAC", 9]]}

First, being from Oklahoma (the state Chesapeake Energy is based in), it brings up questions about where the company will go, if it attempts to continue production after having filed for bankruptcy. The company brought over 2k jobs to the state and the OKC Thunder stadium is currently called Chesapeake Energy Arena. As someone from the state and the presence of a professional sports team still being relatively new, it’s brought the state to a somewhat unprecedented circumstance. Honestly I don’t know what all would happen with all of this. If anyone has seen this occur in your local neighborhood or city, please let me know in the comments, I would be highly interested in reading your thoughts. \r\n\r\nSecond, if the company survives and continues production, will it be listed as a penny stock that could be worth buying into as soon as it returns? If it does make a comeback and is extremely cheap, it may be worth dropping like $20 or so into a number of extremely cheap stocks to see if the price surges after investors see the company actually did make a return. Then selling at a higher price, perhaps a much higher price if things go extremely well. CHK being a part of the energy sector, it seems a bit unlikely to me that an energy company would just completely collapse after a single bankruptcy (I’m not an expert on these types of situations, but originally being a local of this company’s market, this brings a unique possibility of positives and negatives in my mind).\r\n\r\nThird and final, this could give a boost to a number of other energy companies local to Oklahoma. With homes and businesses relying on this company for energy, other local companies could be sweeping in and increasing their customer base. Some companies include Devon Energy (DVN, which in my mind is probably the most successful energy company in OKC, seeing how their main offices are the lone skyscraper in Oklahoma City. A bit shallow of course, but it’s a prominent figure in the kinds of locals) Continental Resources (CLR), and Sandridge Energy (SD). It will be very interesting to see if any of these companies’ stock values jump if Chesapeake can’t or simply doesn’t make a come back.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nEdit: Robinhood has Chesapeake Energy labeled as CHKAQ but does not allow purchases or sales of stocks at this time.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1593541206.0, "tickers": [["CHK", 2]]}

{"name": "t3_hk2pdv", "title": "Here's My Spreadsheet for Filtering Div Stocks", "text": "Howdy people. I'm relatively new to dividend investing, and probably like a lot of people around here I've been researching ways to hopefully pick good dividend paying stocks to hold long term.\r\n\r\nI'm also a software developer, so I created a Google sheet with a script to fetch data from a couple of APIs, populate some fields, and filter out stocks based on criteria that make sense to me. It also gives me a lint to the Seeking Alpha dividend page for that stock.\r\n\r\nIt's late here, and I'm sleepy, so take that into consideration when you're reading this! It's turned into quite a long post.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the spreadsheet looks like this (this screenshot has the 'filter' sheet missing though):\r\n\r\n[All the data is fetched from IEX Cloud and Google Finance \\(apart from the tickers themselves\\)](https://preview.redd.it/daa8mdskdh851.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b61a30d29bdc77802eac20c19c42dde94f8aeec)\r\n\r\nI guess it'd be irresponsible of me not to include the 'bigger-picture' advice, and other things I considered before and during using this to make decisions. My investing plan is basically dividend growth; so long-term holding (20+ years), and I care more about the company's fundamentals, qualitative factors, and dividend and financial history than I do about the stock price on any given day (although I'll definitely by companies I like when they're cheap!). Also, if you're a Brit like me, between 18 and 40, and have similar investing goals to me, then get a Lifetime ISA and put £4,000 in it every year before buying any stocks. The government will give you 25% on top up to £1000 per year. Can't beat guaranteed 25% return on £4k. Unfortunately, I'm British, but not a UK tax resident, so I can't do that. If I could, that's what I'd do before even looking at the stock market.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Someone from /r/UKInvesting asked about the Lifetime ISA (LISA), and I realised that I forgot to actually say what the Lifetime ISA is good for! (I think I mentioned I was sleepy when I wrote this :) ) A Lifetime ISA gives you a 25% bonus each year (up to £1,000) for you to spend either on your first home, *or* for retirement. You can contribute to a LISA until you're 50, but not withdraw from it for retirement until you're 60. You can withdraw from it any time to help buy a first home. And you can contribute to a LISA and a regular ISA, and even a Help To Buy ISA (if you opened one before they were stopped) in the same tax year, as long as your total ISA contributions don't go over the yearly limit, which is £20,000 for 2020-2021. Lastly, if you have a LISA and a Help to Buy ISA, you can only use one for helping to buy your first home. So long story short, if you're investing for the long-term, I'd say open a LISA and stick your first £4,000 of investment money each year in that...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I thought I'd share my spreadsheet and script with the community in the hope that it's useful, and that hopefully people can feed into it and suggest improvements.\r\n\r\n[Here's the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_V0ofdoRzCWGZtV8ksuPF85cS8iM-JN9wdGrgQaFBZ8/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n[And here's the script you need](https://pastebin.com/X5P4vBaX)\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to get one or more API keys from [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/). It's free, and no, I have nothing to do with them. It's probably better to get a few keys by signing up a few times with different email addresses. Otherwise there's a good chance you'll max out your API call quota for a given API key. You only need to confirm the email address, and they'll give you the API key straight after, so don't worry about remembering all the email addresses and passwords you use. Also, don't tell them I told you to do this. ;)\r\n\r\nThere's a place to put all the API keys at the top of the script. It should be pretty straight forward, just make sure they're all in single or double quotes, and that they're separated by commas.\r\n\r\nOnce the sheet and script are set up, the workflow I use is pretty speedy to weed out stocks I'm not interested in owning:\r\n\r\n* Grab a list of tickers that your broker sells (I'm a Brit so use Trading212 and Freetrade, but I guess most brokers will have a list of the instruments they have available)\r\n* Paste the list of ticker symbols into the sheet (symbols only! Only edit column B of the first sheet)\r\n* Adjust the filter criteria in the second sheet (min dividend, payout ratio range, max P/E ratio, and min EPS)\r\n* From the resulting filtered stocks, follow the Seeking Alpha link of each one to check out more info, like dividend growth over time, dividend news, and financials like total revenue over time.\r\n\r\nI can make a rough yes / no decision with this technique in probably about 30 seconds per stock. Maybe I'm missing some important things, so please say if you think this is a stupid idea - I'm here to learn!\r\n\r\nIf you're not well versed with Google sheets then it might not be totally obvious how to set it all up. I'll run though the basic steps, and then give a more detailed walk through after:\r\n\r\n* Copy the sheet linked above so you can edit it.\r\n* Sign up a few times to IEX Cloud and get some API keys\r\n* Go to Tools -> Script Editor\r\n* Paste the code from the second link above into the script. Delete anything that's already in the script (I think there's a default \\`myFunction()\\` thing - delete that and anything else before pasting my code\r\n* Save the script. You'll probably have to create a new project too - call it whatever you want, doesn't matter.\r\n* Still in the script editor, go to Edit -> Current Project's Triggers\r\n* Click 'Add Trigger' in the bottom right\r\n* Set 'Choose which function to run' to 'getData'\r\n* 'Choose which deployment should run' will be 'Head' (only choice)\r\n* 'Select event source' should be 'From Spreadsheet'\r\n* 'Select event type' should be 'On Edit'\r\n* Then set 'Failure notification settings' to whatever you want. I have mine on daily.\r\n* Click 'Save'.\r\n* You'll have to give permission for the script to interact with your sheet (maybe another coder on here can verify that my code doesn't do anything evil)\r\n\r\nThat's it! Now you can go to the 'Watch List' sheet, add a ticker into column B, and the script will fill in all the other data. Sometimes it's a little slow, and some data might be missing, but it's mostly there for the good stocks.\r\n\r\nThen go to the filter sheet and you'll see a bunch of filtered dividend stocks based on the criteria in the left column. Of course you can edit these to your heart's content!\r\n\r\nThen if you want you can click through to Seeking Alpha and see more info, like how long they've been paying dividends for, have their payments been growing, how are their financials etc? In the future I'd like to skip this step and have all that info in the sheet itself as part of the filter. But the APIs I've used don't give me that info (for free, at least), and I don't have much time to dig around for a better solution at the moment.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope it's useful! I'd love to know what you think!\r\n\r\nAnd for those who like to follow along with pictures, here are the same steps with screen shots:\r\n\r\nCopy the sheet linked above so you can edit it:\r\n\r\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1iyv2hkih851.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a6b05478af196f20afe7521b86a195eec1f81b\r\n\r\nSign up a few times to IEX Cloud and get some API keys:\r\n\r\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gcb7w3alh851.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f869e874c5e6a6f074cba6f51df15440abc356f\r\n\r\nBack in the sheet, go to Tools -> Script Editor:\r\n\r\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3hxrbwvnh851.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c4175e5cccb15c9d9366b223e9586c4fab7f0d8\r\n\r\nPaste the code from the second link above into the script.

So I am a long term investor in my 401K and IRA I have a couple of brokerage accounts that I trade options and futures in. So I’m not a total noob.\r\n\r\nI had an idea a while back, since even HY savings accounts are crap and really don’t beat or even get close to inflation that I would move my savings to a long term, low risk brokerage account that focused on stable returns, with good dividends to make up about a 5-7% annual return. \r\n\r\nThe reason for this was two fold, one I would like my emergency funds and long term savings to make a good return and I don’t need the money instantly. I can wait the 3 days if I need to cash it out. \r\n\r\nSo, I set out and did a lot of research and landed on a couple of low fee ETFs. FBND & FDHY - both Fidelity ETFs with a positive NAV over the long term. They both pay monthly dividends. So I started out with FBND and held it for about three months up until the market crash. My thought for going with bond ETF‘s over the actual bond is the liquidity and the ability to exit at any time. My other thought was bonds are much more stable than equities. I found FDHY after the market and crashed and was able to buy and relatively cheap somewhere around $40 per share. It pays about a $.20-$.21 dividend per share per month. And is up already around between 3 and 5% depending on where the market wants to move. \r\n\r\nMy second move was to put it in Coca-Cola, so half the portfolio is in Coca-Cola and the other half is in FDHY. Both roughly stabilize around the $40-$50 mark and pay a solid dividend unchanged since it’s open. \r\n\r\nMy question is what are your thoughts around the strategy and what are your thoughts on these particular ETFs?", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "created_utc": 1593870147.0, "tickers": [["HY", 1], ["NAV", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_hob4ei", "title": "Why the **** is $T so popular?!?", "text": "So I have been involved in this subreddit for a while now and have been able to observe many trends or commonalities in all of your portfolios.  Most of the time you all are doing pretty well, or at least I think so. However, there are a few things that keep popping up in this group that I whole-heartedly disagree with, and today I want to share one with you all and get your opinions.\r\n\r\nI’m talking about $T.  $T is probably one of the more common dividend stocks that I’ve seen on here and I just can’t for the life of me understand why.  First off, I’d like to start with some financial ratios and metrics because I’m a financial analyst as my day job (at JPMorgan) and thats what we look at first. Here are some that I’ve pulled out in particular for you all:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$T \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividend Yield: \t\t6.83%\r\n\r\nPayout Ratio: \t\t\t104.12%\r\n\r\nDiv. Coverage Ratio: \t\t96.05%\r\n\r\n3yr Div. Growth Rate: \t\t2.0%\r\n\r\n10yr Div. Growth Rate: \t\t2.1%\r\n\r\nProfit Margin (PM):  \t\t8.70%\r\n\r\nCash Flow/Share (TTM): \t\t$5.99\r\n\r\nCurrent Ratio (CR): \t\t0.76\r\n\r\n\r\nSo these are just a few that I wanted to pick out and highlight as reasons why I would never suggest investing in $T right now.  First, lets take a look at the Payout Ratio.  Seeing a payout of over 100% is extremely concerning to me right off the bat and this alone would usually keep me from investing.  This payout means its paying out more money in dividends than it’s making as a company.  Next, the Dividend Coverage Ratio, which is almost the opposite formula from the payout ratio.  For $T, the dividend coverage ratio is only 96.05%, which means that its earnings can only cover 96% of the dividends it pays.  This again is extremely concerning.  Next, when we look at the dividend growth rate on paper with no context, 2% and 2.1% is solid. However, when we consider the fact that this growth has overtaken $T’s net income growth, so it is now paying out more than it makes, this is very concerning for the viability of the dividend going forward.\r\n\r\nWith all of that being said, it is hard for most people to gain insight based purely off of those numbers above with no context, since most people don’t sit in front of a computer looking at company financials and data like I do.  So in order to give you all some context, I have put together the corresponding information for a few of $T’s biggest competitors, namely $VZ and $BCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$VZ\r\n\r\n\r\nDividend Yield: \t\t4.44%\r\n\r\nPayout Ratio: \t\t\t55.06%\r\n\r\nDiv. Coverage Ratio: \t\t181.62%\r\n\r\n3yr Div. Growth Rate:\t\t2.2%\r\n\r\n10yr Div. Growth Rate: \t\t2.6%\r\n\r\nProfit Margin (PM): \t\t14.4%\r\n\r\nCash Flow/Share (TTM): \t\t$8.58\r\n\r\nCurrent Ratio (CR): \t\t0.99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$BCE\r\n\r\n\r\nDividend Yield: \t\t5.99%\r\n\r\nPayout Ratio: \t\t\t96.05%\r\n\r\nDiv. Coverage Ratio: \t\t104.12%\r\n\r\n3yr Div. Growth Rate:\t\t5.1%\r\n\r\n10yr Div. Growth Rate: \t\t7.1%\r\n\r\nProfit Margin (PM): \t\t13.36%\r\n\r\nCash Flow/Share (TTM): \t\t$6.10\r\n\r\nCurrent Ratio (CR): \t\t0.88\r\n\r\n\r\nSo now that you all have some context on $T’s performance, you can clearly see that, in some of the most important metrics for dividends and profitability, $T is behind 2 of its main competitors.  The only metric/ratio that $T is better in is its dividend yield, which is concerning because its long-term profitability is very much at question and this could greatly jeopardize its dividend going forward.\r\n\r\nI believe that a lot of people see that almost 7% dividend and the big, established name of $T and think “It must be safe because they’ve been around a long time and always grow their dividend.”  But a deeper look into their financials shows that this is not the case at all.\r\n\r\nSo I want to pose the question to you all: Now that you have seen this, what are your thoughts on $T?  Will you still invest in it?  Will you sell your current shares?  Will you conduct further research on your own?  All opinions are welcome and I’d love to hear whatever you have to say.", "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "created_utc": 1594328058.0, "tickers": [["T", 6]]}

{"name": "t3_ho680i", "title": "Portfolio Review: Destined for Greatness", "text": "For the past few weeks I have been reviewing portfolios people have posted on this subreddit.  A few days ago, u/ikey2013 messaged me and asked for me to review his portfolio, [linked here](https://m1.finance/OHbARjcDcZ5D).  Today I will metaphorically rip apart his portfolio, performing a deep dive on every company.  But first, the disclaimer:\r\n\r\n(Inserting my copy-pasted disclaimer about how this is just my opinion and while I do have a degree in Business Administration and Management, I am not giving you professional advice.  I use a broker called [M1 Finance](https://m1.finance/n0lW_WEmAcpi) and [here is the link to my personal portfolio](https://m1.finance/7JevHWUBdE4S) for disclosure sake/proof I'm not just blowing smoke, since my portfolio is beating the S&P 500 over the past 5 years.  If I am recommending a stock, it is because I actually own it and believe in the company for the long haul.  Remember, these are my researched opinions, and you should treat them as such.  My primary research platform is Seeking Alpha.)\r\n\r\nFor the sake of brevity, I will not be analyzing companies that are already in my portfolio, as I do not want to sound like a broken record.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>Bristol Myers Squibb Co. ($BMY)\r\n\r\nOn paper, this company is doing well.  Solid revenue growth.  Unfortunately, this is dramatically overshadowed by the faults in the dividend.  Healthcare is a very fragile industry.  This is reflected in $BMY's net income, which fluctuates massively from year to year. Profits can evaporate on a dime, which is why companies need to keep a very close eye on their dividends and payout ratios, lest they take on debt they cannot afford. $BMY does not seem to understand this principle.  In 2015, their payout ratio was 158.27%.  In 2017 their payout ratio was 255.91%.  As of Q2 2020, their trailing twelve month payout ratio is a whopping 317.30%.  Considering that revenue and the gross profit margin have grown every single year since 2015, a picture begins to paint itself of what is happening.\r\n\r\nI understand trying to maintain one's dividend, but it has to be done sustainably.  This company is listing itself as having around $50 billion in debt.  With a debt to equity ratio of 96%, this company has a higher ratio than AT&T!  This is incredibly dangerous, and the board does not seem to care.  A 40% D/E ratio is considered high.  96% is stratospheric and growing.\r\n\r\nFrom my outsider perspective, it looks like a hard dividend cut is in this company's future.  The dividend is rising faster than profits, executive compensation is way higher than industry averages for a company of this size, shareholders are being diluted.  This company is setting course for either bankruptcy court or a dividend cut.  Considering the underlying revenue and gross profit margins of the company are strong, the latter option seems more likely.\r\n\r\nRecommended replacement: Amgen\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>AmerisourceBergen Corporation ($ABC)\r\n\r\nThere are many facets of the healthcare industry.  Among them, drug distribution is not the place you want to be right now.   AmerisourceBergen is currently being sued by every state and their mother right now due to the company's role in the opioid epidemic currently plaguing rural America.  I could sit here all day and explain the horrible actions this company took, but if people care about that, they can read the lawsuits.  Let's talk about the numbers.\r\n\r\nOver the past five years, revenue has grown by around $40 billion, but the company's profit has remained stagnant at around $1billion.  In 2019, the company generated around $180 billion in revenue.  The company turned that $180 billion into 855 million in profit.  To put that in perspective, $ABC has a net profit margin of 0.47%.  That margin is not small, it is not tiny, it could barely even be called razor thin.  The most accurate term would be microscopic.\r\n\r\nRecommended Replacement: Medtronic\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>  National Retail Properties and Federal Realty Investment Trust\r\n\r\nFine investments.  The only problem is FRT's payout ratio is too high for me personally.  Retail is being hammered by this pandemic, but if these guys survive, they will be excellent investments.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>LTC Properties\r\n\r\nI hate stagnant dividends with a burning passion.  As long as inflation exists, stagnant dividends will be something I despise.\r\n\r\nRecommended replacement: Essex Property Trust\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>Bank OZK\r\n\r\nWhile I am typically a big fan of regional banks, I do not hold the highest opinion of those who like stock splits.  OZK has done two in the past ten years alone.  With the advent of fractional share purchases, stock splits are effectively obsolete.  I would not advise against this stock, but I personally am hesitant.  I like how insiders hold a very sizable portion of the company, but the amount of shareholder dilution is concerning.\r\n\r\nRecommended replacement: Stock Yards Bancorp\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>Discover Financial Services\r\n\r\nThis company seems more focused on its dividend than actually growing its business.  If we were talking about a utility, that would be fine.  Unfortunately, this is a company with two massive competitors (Visa and Mastercard) who would prefer their industry to remain a duopoly.  When you are a small player challenging not one, but two fin-tech giants, growth should be a priority, especially since V and MA still consider themselves growth companies, hence why their payout ratios are so low.  \r\n\r\nRecommended replacement: An equal portion of V and MA.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>Wells Fargo\r\n\r\nI've made the case against Wells Fargo before, so I won't make myself out to be a broken record on the subject, but long story short, I would not consider buying into this stock until the entire board has been replaced.  This company has been mismanaged for years at this point and has nothing to show for it.  Interest revenue has grown by over $15 billion in the past five years, but the company has shed about $3 billion in net interest profits over the same time.  Based upon the data, it seems that Wells Fargo was taking on higher risk revenue streams.  This is reflected in the soaring interest revenue on loans and borrowings the company collected, but the decline in non-interest revenue.  These and other data points paint a picture that suggests clients who are in a less financially secure position were getting larger loans at higher interest rates. It works only as long as your clients are employed.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThen we have the lawsuits and the fraud, which brought down consumer interest in the bank.  New customer signups dropped off a cliff.  To cover up this shortfall and prevent the dividend from coming under pressure, the company ramped up its share buybacks.  This is why the company's stock price stagnated.  Not because they were doing anything innovative to make the stock worth holding, they simply just began buying back shares.  \r\n\r\nIn the part of the country where I live, Wells Fargo used to be seen as the definitive place to get your mortgage.  The local branch was willing to match any other bank's offer.   Looking at mortgage revenue today, we see it cut by 2/3rds over the past five years.  All of this can be combined and you can see why the dividend was forced to be cut.  All of this was entirely preventable.  \r\n\r\nIs the company in a better state now than in 2009?  Honestly hard to say.  The damage is that bad.  You could be a billionaire on paper, but if you are only a billionaire because you own 1 billion $1 coffee mugs, then your wealth doesn't really mean anything.  If all your clients will declare bankruptcy the second the stimulus money runs out, you will be in for a wild ride.\r\n\r\nRecommended replacement: JP Morgan\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n>Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\n\r\nI used to be very pessimistic about this company.  As a retail manager, every instinct in me says this company is on the wrong path.  However, management seems like they are trying to clean the place up.  If they succeed, this will be a great holding to have.  If not, I would get out while you can.\r\n\r\nIf you sell, recommended replacement: CVS\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>McDonald's\r\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, speaking as a manager at Cracker Barrel, franchising is a horrible and outdated business model.  To sum up the problem with franchises in one word, it would be \"loyalty,\" more specifically the lack of it.  Everyone involved in a franchise operation is out to make money, end of story.   Any manager on Earth will tell you that when employees do not care about their job, the entire business suffers.  I have yet to meet an individual who works at a franchise who actually cares about their job.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, my employer Cracker Barrel refuses to franchise.  It is the second largest publicly traded restaurant company in the United States that does not franchise (second only to Chipotle).  The only thing stopping this company is the number of stores.  Cracker Barrel isn't even in all fifty states yet.  The company chooses to expand slowly and methodically.  There is a dedicated team of employees whose sole purpose is to open stores.  These employees (called 'red shirts') are hand picked from stores around the country and work collectively to make sure every new store opening is as smooth as possible.  Each and every one of them cares deeply about this company.  The vast majority of our employees care about this company.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you how many people start out working for us just as a summer or part time job, but then simply fall in love with this company and end up working here for their entire careers.  This company is legendary in the restaurant and retail industries for its retention rates.  We have employees and managers that have been with this company for decades.  Of course, most employees come and go.  College students who wait tables to pay for their degrees, hosts who simply need a summer job before their senior year of high school.  But every single store has its core.  The PAR IVs who are in this for the long haul.  They are the cornerstone of every store, and they work together like a well oiled machine.  The best servers in my store make over $50,000 a year, when the average check size is around $11.\r\n\r\nThis loyalty goes both ways. When the pandemic hit, corporate refused to lay anyone off and instead took out debt to give every employee two weeks of retention pay and to maintain manger's salaries.  The only people who got laid off were 22 District managers and 2 Regional Vice Presidents.  They were offered severance in exchange for early retirement.  Cracker Barrel took advantage of the pandemic to clean up its corporate structure and internal logistics network, and it paid off.  Last week, my store (restaurant+retail) made $90,000 in sales, because all our experienced employees never left.   \r\n\r\nSpeaking of corporate structure, another disadvantage of the franchise model.  Internal promotion is impossible.  No company would promote a franchise owner to be an executive.  However, when everyone already works for the company, internal promotion can become the default.  When a company internally promotes its best and brightest, you keep that talent inside the company.  It is physically impossible for someone who works outside Cracker Barrel to be hired as a District manager or Regional Vice President.  This company has found that external hires simply cannot compare to those internally promoted.  Managers undergo weeks of training at the company's headquarters in Lebanon, Tennessee, and the majority of external hires just can't handle it and drop out.  In fact, pretty much everyone at Home Office was internally promoted and used to work in a store.  It all comes back to actually caring about your job and the company you work for.\r\n\r\nI could go on all day, but the numbers speak for themselves.  The average McDonald's generates roughly $1.1 million in revenue.  The average Cracker Barrel generates over $4.5 million per year.  I often get asked sarcastically if people actually buy the products we sell in retail.  The answer is yes.  If people do not want it, we do not sell it.  Retail makes up 20% of Cracker Barrel's total revenue.  In my store alone, my 20 employees (2 full time shift leaders, 3 full time, 13 part time, and 2 seasonal) we alone generate more revenue than the average McDonald's, and we are not even the largest store in our district (though granted we are an above average store).  I'm not allowed to give exact figures, but let's just say my manager bonus last year was very nice, and I reward my people.\r\n\r\nTo get back to McDonald's, its franchising is a hindrance to its own success.  Stores compete with each other, instead of working together.  This brings down the entire company, and we see falling revenue year over year.  This company has no real room to grow.  McDonald's has built a reputation for being dirty, unhealthy, and greedy. Unless the company can fix itself, it will be nothing but downhill.  \r\n\r\nRecommended Replacement: Cracker Barrel.  Sadaar Biglari's idiotic war against the board has kept this company's share price stagnant for the past few years.  He ran steak n shake into the ground, and has been trying to force himself on CBRLs board since 2012.  In the process, he's nearly bankrupted his own company, while Cracker Barrel has continued to grow and thrive.   Once Biglari bankrupts himself into irrelevance, the stock price will begin growing again.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>Best Buy\r\n\r\nI think Best Buy needs to make some significant course corrections to prevent going the way of other retailers.  This pandemic is likely to single-handedly kill the concept of Black Friday and holiday shopping in person, which is where Best Buy makes about half of their net income for the year.  The business model of making all your profit in Q4 is not going to work in the 21st century.  Retailers like Target are successful because they make decent money year round, with the holidays simply being a bonus.  The company does not need the holidays to make a profit for the year.  \r\n\r\nThis is what the people who forecast the death of retail do not realize.  The kind of retail where you do all your business between October and December is going to die.  The kind of retail where all revenue is dispersed evenly, with smaller spikes in Q2 or Q4, that is what will generate the most returns.\r\n\r\nRecommended replacement: Target\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, on your pie allocation: \r\n\r\nHealthcare should not be the cornerstone of your portfolio.

For those unfamiliar, all three are considered **GSE's** (**Government-Sponsored Enterprises)**. \r\n\r\n2) **What does a GSE do?**\r\n\r\nBasically GSE's act as secondary markets for mortgages and loans. In the primary market, a primary lender writes up a mortgage. This mortgage (or an asset of these mortgages) can then be sold to a secondary lender. The reason why these secondary lenders exist is because they are able to reduce the cost of capital on these mortgages/loans, making them more accessible to the general population.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a GSE like Farmer Mac improves access to credit. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n3) **But wait, doesn't that mean GSE's take on toxic mortgage assets?**\r\n\r\nIn general, yes. \r\n\r\nBut there's a catch. Both the primary lenders that AGM purchases the bulk of these agriculture loans/assets from (the **Farm Credit System**) as well as AGM itself are both regulated by the **Farm Credit Association.** \r\n\r\nThe Farm Credit Association is an independent agency of the federal government which exists to regulate the financial institutions that provide credit to farmers.\r\n\r\nIn light of the Great Recession, the farm credit association has made tremendous leaps in ensuring only the most conservative underwriting measures to reduce the risk of default on these loans.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**FINANCIALS**\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow, here's the juicy part and why I think this is such a good investment. All this info is copy-pasted straight from their Q1 update:\r\n\r\n* Provided $1.3 billion in liquidity and lending capacity in first quarter 2020, resulting in net outstanding business volume growth of $421.4 million; \r\n*  Net income attributable to common stockholders was $9.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share; \r\n* • Core earnings, a non-GAAP measure was $20.1 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share; \r\n* • Net interest income grew $0.7 million year-over-year to $41.3 million; \r\n* • Net effective spread, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14% from the prior-year period to $44.2 million; \r\n* **• 90-day delinquencies were 0.37% of total outstanding business volume as of March 31, 2020**\r\n*  **First quarter provision for credit losses of $3.8 million, largely driven by expected COVID-19 impact.** \r\n\r\nLook at that provision for credit loss. It's only $3.8 million.That's **0.09%** of their outstanding business volume. That's nothing at all. This means they don't expect to face significant losses on their assets.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Dividend**\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n* AGM has a near 5% dividend yield with a payout ratio of \\~35%\r\n* AGM recently raised the dividend from 0.70 per quarter to 0.80 per quarter\r\n\r\n**LONG TERM OUTLOOK**\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n* U.S. government won't allow farmers to suffer tremendous losses on their loans.

This is my first post and it's probably way too detailed, so my apologies for the length. But, I'd love to hear any feedback or suggestions on my portfolio, as well as any recommendations you would have for reducing the total number of different companies in which I'm currently invested. \r\n\r\nI currently have (40) different stocks and feel like perhaps that might be slightly too many, although I know there's no 'right' number of stocks to own. If you had the same portfolio and were going to consolidate your holdings down to perhaps 20-25 stocks or so, which of these would you keep and why? Or, if you prefer, which of these would you sell and why? \r\n\r\nJust a quick note about me. I'm 48 yrs old and apart from the 401k plan that I passively invest in through my company, I'm new to investing. I only bought my first few stocks back in early March during the first major market crash. I figured it would be a good time to get in and get some stocks at a very good price. \r\n\r\nUsing Robinhood, I initially invested $100 and bought (6) different stocks on March 6, not really knowing much about stocks or the market in general. In fact, of those six initial stocks, I've only kept two of them (HA, INO). Since then, I've invested $3500 more and am currently up $498.74 (14.25%). Not too bad, but it can be better...\r\n\r\nI recently began more of a focused effort to switch to dividend producing stocks. I sold many of the stocks I had initially bought that either weren't performing well or didn't generate a dividend. Below are each of the stocks I currently own, grouped together by dividend frequency. I included the number of shares in parentheses, as well as a brief note or explanation for most.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any thoughts, comments, opinions, suggestions, recommendations, or even criticisms.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Monthly Dividend**\r\n\r\n$KBWD (4.036) - Bought this inexpensive ETF due to monthly dividend, but am considering selling it and replacing it with $JEPI instead. \r\n\r\n$PSEC (5.022) - Bought this because of consistent monthly dividend and solid recommendations.  \r\n\r\n$STAG (2) - Bought this because of consistent monthly dividend and solid recommendations. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Quarterly Dividend**\r\n\r\n$ABBV (2) - Recently bought this Dividend Aristocrat because of excellent dividend history. \r\n\r\n$ADT (2.009) - Originally received as free stock due to referral on Robinhood, added another share because it was inexpensive and performing well, and has a small dividend. \r\n\r\n$AUY (4.009) - Bought this because of good dividend history and figured it would be good to have position in metals.  \r\n\r\n$CARR (2) - Recently bought this Dividend Aristocrat because of excellent dividend history. \r\n\r\n$EURN (10.749) - Bought this because of good dividend history. However, currently in the hole in terms of stock performance. I plan to sell once it (hopefully) returns to break even point for me. \r\n\r\n$HA (2) - Bought this early on, more for sentimental reasons than anything, as I've visited four of the Hawaiian Islands over the years. But, it has a small dividend, so that's a bonus. With it being a smaller airline with significant footprint in Hawaii, I feel like it has a better chance than most other airlines to survive the COVID downturn.  \r\n\r\n$HAL (2.008) - Bought this because of good dividend history. Good returns so far.\r\n\r\n$JEF (4) - Bought this because of good dividend history. Good returns so far. \r\n\r\n$K (2) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history. \r\n\r\n$KDP (2) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history.\r\n\r\n$KR (5) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history.\r\n\r\n$LOW (4) - Bought this Dividend Aristocrat because of excellent dividend history and also becasue it's one of my personal favorite stores. \r\n\r\n$LUV (2) - Bought this because I feel like they are perhaps a little better positioned than some of the other airlines and will have a better chance of getting through the COVID related downturn. Also, this is my personal favorite airline to fly. \r\n\r\n$MSFT (3.005) - No-brainer investment in solid technology leader that I can actually afford. \r\n\r\n$NBLX (5) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history. \r\n\r\n$PBFX (2) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history.  \r\n\r\n$PNC (1) - Recently bought this financial stock instead because of good dividend history. \r\n\r\n$SIRI (2) - Originally received as free stock due to referral on Robinhood, added another share because it was inexpensive and performing well and because it's part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. It also has a small dividend, which is a bonus. \r\n\r\n$VZ (6) - Bought this because of good dividend history. Debated between this and AT&T, but ultimately chose this because of slightly lower company debt and higher growth rate, even though dividend is less. \r\n\r\n$XOM (2.018) - Bought this Dividend Aristocrat because of excellent dividend history.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Semi-Annual Dividend**\r\n\r\n$SFYX (2) - Bought this inexpensive ETF due to potential return of holdings. \r\n\r\n$SM (2) - Bought this because it was an inexpensive energy stock with a dividend.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Annual/Special Dividend**\r\n\r\n$BAYRY (4) - Bought this because of its repuation as solid healthcare/pharma company with consistent dividend history. \r\n\r\n$FCAU (2) - Bought this very early on, before I knew what I was doing, just because I thought it would be good to own. I was thinking about selling it a few weeks ago, but was planning to hang onto it to see what happens as a result of merger and rebranding. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**No Dividend**\r\n\r\n$BRK.B (1) - Bought this when it was lower, but it's honestly been a bit of a disappointment, cosidering Warren Buffet's repuatation. \r\n\r\n$DIS (2) - Bought these early on for average of $83.36 per share, so it's generated a nice return so far.  \r\n\r\n$HTZ (2) - Took a flyer on these, unfortunatley just before the company announced the bankruptcy. Since I'm in the hole, I figured I would just hold them in the hopes that perhaps enough value comes back that I can at least break even.  \r\n\r\n$INO (2) - Bought these for average of $10.78, so it's generated a nice return so far. \r\n\r\n$LVGO (2) - Bought these for average of $54.26, so it's generated a nice return so far. \r\n\r\n$NOG (30) - Initially bought 10 shares in early march for $0.78, but then added more in early June at a significantly higher rate, so I'm currently in the hole. I plan to sell once it (hopefully) returns to break even point for me. \r\n\r\n$OSS (10) - Took a flyer on some shares of this penny stock last week, as it generated a lot of interest and seemeed like it could take off. \r\n\r\n$PINS (2) - Bought this as it is one of the more affordable social media platforms. Hoping that eventually it takes off, so this is a long-term play.  \r\n\r\n$PTON (1) - Bought this at $22.55, so it's generated a nice return so far.  \r\n\r\n$SEAS (1) - Bought this very early on, before I knew what I was doing, only because I thought it would be fun/cool to own.\r\n\r\n$SPCE (1) - Took a flyer on this, hoping that eventually it takes off, so this is a long-term play.  \r\n\r\n$TMFC (2) - ETF that tracks top 100 or so stocks identified in The Motley Fool publications.  \r\n\r\n$ZVO (1) - Just took a flyer on this 'penny stock' of an online education company, figuring the COVID lockdowns will likely only continue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cn47ae20lnb51.png?width=1637&format=png&auto=webp&s=08debe458f84fa3a0f808fe5a9388000a6122f09\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qpuis91lnb51.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&s=c63e044e23f4ad75e23dc20d8ca94c0d0a3468c5", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1595094532.0, "tickers": []}

I think that's what got me interested in QYLD. \r\n\r\nThis is weighted by % in my portfolio\r\n\r\n* O - Reality Income Corp - 15%\r\n* SPHD - S&P 500 High Dividend - 13%\r\n* QYLD - NASDAQ Covered Calls ETF - 10%\r\n* VZ - Verizon - 10%\r\n* T - AT&T - 9%\r\n* MMP - Magellan Midstream - 8%\r\n* PRU - Prudential Financial - 7%\r\n* BNS - Bank of Nova Scotia - 5%\r\n* MMM - 3M - 5%\r\n* XOM - Exxon Mobile\r\n* BEP - Brookfield Renewable Partners - 2%\r\n* VYM - Vanguard High Yield - target 5%\r\n\r\nSo before anyone starts typing JNJ or KO, I work in a regulatory agency where I'm not allowed to have holdings in those type of consumer goods and medical/pharm stuff. I believe that includes ETFs in those sectors too. \r\n\r\nWould love some strong critiques!

Now that makes some sense to me, due to the current threats/climate. However, this has left many REITs with attractive valuations and attractive dividends. \r\nOffice REITs in particular seem to have the best valuations. Now I understand that due to working from home and other COVID related impacts, have brought in to questions the value of office space. Lots of companies have stated that they will continue the working from home trend, even after COVID ends due to the saved costs. \r\nHowever, I think this impact is overestimated. Lots of companies rely heavily on collaboration and collaboration that just works better face to face. Yes people can connect via zoom, teams etc but it’s just not the same. Also a few company managers have stated that they feels that the lower levels of control, communication and team mindset has a worse affect on productivity than the saved costs of working from home. \r\nSo as I see it, there is a great chance a lot of companies will return to office space when this is all said and done. \r\nAssuming the REIT you look at is in great shape, great occupancy rates and quality tenants, they seem like a sound investment.\r\nI’ve seen come with yields of 8-11%.\r\n\r\nI’m really curious to put this out there and gain your opinion. \r\nMuch appreciated and stay safe!", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "created_utc": 1595266250.0, "tickers": [["RE", 1]]}

This, plus the prospectus being focused on holding companies that are expected to continually increase dividends makes VIG attractive as a diversification/risk balance along with SPYD.\r\n\r\nHere's some quick holdings info:\r\n\r\n||SPYD|VIG|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|Real Estate|16.5%|0%|\r\n|IT|3.9%|17.5%|\r\n|Financials|15.5%|7.1%|\r\n|Utilities|11.7%|4.9%|\r\n|Healthcare|9%|16.6%|\r\n|Energy|10.8%|0%|\r\n|Industrials|0%|15.2%|\r\n\r\nThis isn't all of the holdings but as you can see, the majority of each ETF counters the other in terms of what sector they put more into.

I've always enjoyed this sub, so I wanted to post some of my progress and I'm always open for constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nMy dividend portfolio consists of 16 paying individual stocks, CEFs, ETFs, ETNs, BDCs and REITs.\r\n\r\nHoldings: [https://imgur.com/a/caZW3ki](https://imgur.com/a/caZW3ki) \r\n\r\nThe portfolio is in a taxable brokerage with the sole purpose of providing income in early retirement. I am mostly concerned with preservation of my money. I don't want any or very little ROC (Return of Capital) and I'm not chasing massive gains here, at least in this account. I have additional IRAs, SEP IRAs, Roth IRAs, HSAs and 401ks that I am going after the growth plays in.\r\n\r\nI'm currently in my late 30s and have plans to retire by the time I am 48. A goal of mine was to build enough to pay the mortgage, and we did that and paid our mortgage off in March of 2019. So now, we are 100% debt free and all extra cash flow is being reinvested. My employer has a stock purchase plan and I get a 10% discount on the lowest price of the stock in the quarter, so I max out that benefit and after the holding period, I roll over the proceeds to this brokerage account and rinse and repeat. While I like our company, I don't want to have too much tied to the future of my employer.\r\n\r\nThe long term goal is to have no debt, own a house outright (these first two are both done) and generate at least 65k/yr or more in dividend yield from this account in order to FIRE. I don't use DRIP as everything now is commission free and I want to have a little more direction in what the income goes into and buy on down days. Currently the average monthly income is $1,590.13 in this account.\r\n\r\nThis account is used solely as a bridge from the time I decide to FIRE and when I can start drawing on my 401ks, IRAs, SEP IRAs, etc. which I have maxed out throughout my working years. Sure, it's a tax drag, but if you want to retire early, you need to be able to cover that bridge and not just pump into your retirement plans. In addition to the holdings below, I also have \\~100k across long term growth buys that do not pay dividends in this account. They include $BKNG, $OKTA, $LYV, $LOVE. The plan is to hold them for an unknown amount of time, when I'm happy with the profit, convert them into more dividend payers. I'm getting very close to selling $LOVE as I bought in around $7 and have a nice gain thus far.\r\n\r\nI recently added two new dividend paying positions ($JEPI, and $REML) as well, but those are not in my list for two reasons. $JEPI is too new to calculate a long term yield estimate using the TD Ameritrade \"Income Estimator\" tool and I see $REML as a 100% gamble. The dividend yield for $REML is stupid high, currently TD Ameritrade estimates a 77% payout as a mortgage REIT. It was over 100% at one point recently, obviously that is not sustainable and that Income Estimator tool uses that number to calculate future yield. It crashed massively due to COVID back in March and if it recovers will be a slow recovery. I'm not sold on that fact that it will ever recover to that same level. Maybe. Maybe not. It's highly volatile and leveraged. If you can't stomach a loss, DO NOT get into it. If everyone is able to make their mortgage payments throughout this pandemic, there's a ton of upside, if we crash even further, it's likely $REML will be worth $0. I'm ok with this risk. The fat monthly payout and even fatter quarterly payout is nice. Again, total gamble.\r\n\r\nThe list of stocks below gets me an average yield of 7.29%.

{"name": "t3_hwvpug", "title": "Reflecting on my own personal portfolio for Q2 2020 (Portfolio Review?)", "text": "For the past several years in my dividend investment journey, every three months I take a day off and dedicate the entire day to my portfolio.  My wife calls it my \"Excel Day,\" since all she really sees me doing is modifying my Excel spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nToday was that day for Q2 of 2020 (April 2020 through June 2020).  Normally I would just keep this information to my wife and I, but since people seem to really like me reviewing other people's portfolios, I figured it would be kinda interesting to see other people's thoughts on how I view my own portfolio.  \r\n\r\nThe other reason I am posting this is because whenever I do a portfolio review, I always link to my own personal portfolio.  According to my brokerage M1, multiple people have clicked the link to \"invest in this pie,\" and have put real money into mirroring my personal portfolio.   I feel like I owe it to those individuals to inform them of how I am modifying my portfolio based upon the past three months of what I have seen in the markets.  Let them know what I am selling, buying more of, etc.  With that being, said, I guess this is the part where I review my own portfolio.  \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI won't bore you with where I went to research and how I went about researching the activities of the various companies in my portfolio.  I already tend to keep a close eye on most of them, so it was just a matter of checking in on the companies that do not tend to make headlines every day.  I then open up Seeking Alpha and look at the numbers of the companies I am invested in and simply focus on absorbing data, taking a few notes when appropriate.  Once my research is complete, I eat lunch to clear my head.  I then head back to my desk and make some decisions.\r\n\r\nThe first decision is what companies (if any) should I sell out of.  Going into today, I already had companies on the metaphorical chopping block.  Those were: $MMM, $MAIN, $FTAI, $LLY, and $CVS.  It is important to note here why a company can be put on my portfolio's chopping block.  I am always comparing the companies in my portfolio to each other.  Me selling out of a company does not necessarily mean the company is bad, rather that the company may not be completely aligned with my goals as an investor, or that the company is making a series of moves that I personally am opposed to.  I will never sell on a whim.  A company must remain on the chopping block for at least an entire quarter before I allow myself to sell out completely.  This is to prevent me from making impulse decisions.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the research, I determined that I would sell out of $MMM, $LLY, and $CVS.  Let me explain my reasoning below:\r\n\r\n**$MMM**. Looking at this company over the past five years, all I really see is stagnation.  While the dividend is still increasing year over year faster than inflation, virtually every other metric used to analyze a company has remained stagnant.  Net Income for 2019 was actually lower than in 2015.  Stagnant revenue and profits coupled with an increasing dividend equals an increasing payout ratio.  3M is no exception to this rule, seeing a payout ratio rise from 52.99% in 2015 to 72.56% in 2019.  If this continues at this rate, the payout ratio could easily rise to over 90% or even over 100% by 2029.  Considering I am of the \"buy and hold forever\" mindset, this would not be good and could potentially result in a dividend cut several years into the future.  Combine all this with a stagnant share price, and I see 3M serving more as a future drag on my portfolio heading into the 2020s and beyond.\r\n\r\n**$LLY.** I will begin by saying I am not an expert in the healthcare space.  I sold out of this company because I have a philosophy that no matter how good a stock looks, I will only invest in what I can understand.  I cannot analyze that which I do not understand.  When I bought this company, I believed I would try to work more on learning how the healthcare industry works so I could perform more detailed analyses on healthcare companies, but unfortunately I am just as stuck as I was before.  My wife works for the government as a translator, so we use her health insurance.  She understands the American healthcare nightmare more than I do, so she handles that aspect of our lives.  This company may be the most undervalued company on Earth, but I simply cannot own something I know nothing about.  Technically, I could project this onto every company in my healthcare pie, but I recognize that I need exposure to the space to have a diversified portfolio, so I always try to tread very carefully when messing with the companies in my healthcare pie.  \r\n\r\n**$CVS.** I used to recommend this company to people interested in healthcare stocks, but its performance over the past five years has changed my mind.  The stock has been trending nothing but downwards after peaking in late July 2015, with the dividend stagnation only adding to the downward trend.  Compared to my other healthcare stocks, this one is just not keeping up, so I have cut it out.  \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow to explain why I did not sell out of the other companies on the chopping block from last quarter.\r\n\r\n**$MAIN.** This company is about nothing except the dividend to me.  Today the company announced that it was profitable for the second quarter of 2020, which is becoming rarer and rarer in 2020, so good on them for that.  The monthly dividends are a huge draw, and as long as management keeps paying them, I am here for them.  However, if the payout ratio stays too high, I will likely sell, as I prefer sustainable dividends over the long term.\r\n\r\n**$FTAI.** This is a company that I bought years ago at such a low price that I can't bring myself to sell.  Including dividends, my ROI on this company is sitting at around 511.32% over the past few years.  I hate the stagnant dividend, but every time I think about selling, I just cannot bring myself to do it. It's been losing money for years, but just started turning a profit in 2019.  If anyone can give me one or more good reasons to finally ditch this company, I am all ears.  Especially interested in what I should replace it with.  I want the dividends in my portfolio to grow over time and compound.  A stagnant fixed dividend runs counter to that goal.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nLooking over the data for Q2, I have added the following companies to my metaphorical chopping block:\r\n\r\n**$EL.** The shutdowns have really hurt this company.  Even though I tell my wife every day that she is beautiful and does not need makeup, she still uses this company's products on a daily basis.  I bought this company purely because she uses their products, and I wanted to make sure we were profiting off her desire to wear makeup and the other female beauty products that currently sit on my bathroom counter and I have no idea what they are (What is a setting spray?  Should I even care?)  According to my wife, this company owns many valuable brands and is a solid investment in female beauty.  She talked to me about this company for about thirty minutes regarding the different products, and I did not understand any of it.  I got that they made nail polish.  I know what that is because I have a sister who was once a teenager, but other than that I am flying blind here.  If there are any individuals in this subreddit with knowledge of the beauty community, perhaps I can get their opinions on if this stock is worth it for the long term.\r\n\r\nSo going into Q3 of 2020, I think my portfolio is looking very strong.  For those who are interested, [here is the link to my portfolio as it stands now](https://m1.finance/5pfRVMQqi84h), adjusted for what I have mentioned above.  Every company in my portfolio is likely to pay their Q3 dividend on time.  The only suspensions I have in this portfolio are $EL and $DIS.  I have already seen Kroger, Brookfield Renewable Partners, and Canadian National Railway announce dividend increases for this quarter's payments.  \r\n\r\nAs for the company I am most bullish on for Q3 2020, it would have to be Cracker Barrel.  As a manager for the company, I have an insider perspective, and that perspective is telling me that this company could have turned a profit during Q2, but chose not to (based on my back of the envelope calculations).  During the closures, we were limited to only Togo service.  It would have been very easy to just sit idly by and wait out the closures and preserve cash.  Just let all the hourly employees go and keep a skeleton crew.  However, management chose a different strategy.  When the world shut down, Cracker Barrel's executives got together in a closed door meeting and decided on the following things:\r\n\r\n1. Provide retention pay to **all** hourly employees so they can survive the quarantine. The amount of retention pay was determined based upon how long the employee had been with the company.\r\n2. All employees were given the ability to buy food from the restaurant at the price Cracker Barrel paid for it.  By doing this, employees got to fill up the their refrigerators without having to go to a grocery store and potentially get infected and they got good food dirt cheap.\r\n3. All employees who had been with the company long enough got 1 free meal per day through the shutdowns.  That way those employees could conserve cash more easily by cutting their food budget by \\~33%.  \r\n4. The company made sure nobody lost healthcare by essentially paying for everyone's premiums through the shutdowns.\r\n5. Normally employees get a 35% discount on everything.  However, to help employees conserve money, the discount was raised to 50% for the duration of the shutdowns.  Considering we do sell quite a bit of food in retail, this was well received by employees.  \r\n6. All executives were required to take a minimum 50% pay reduction for 2020.  Some executives chose a near 100% pay reduction to help the company preserve cash.  \r\n7. The company gave 2 Regional Vice Presidents and 22 District Managers the \"option\" of early retirement.  Severance and all that jazz.  The head of Restaurant and Retail Operations then got together and redrew all the district and regional boundaries to slim down the corporate structure.  This will save the company a lot of money in the next several years by trimming down the bureaucracy.\r\n8. There were a few other things the company did that I do not know if I am allowed to mention, so I will not mention them because I do not want to have that conversation with my superiors.\r\n\r\nThe question outsiders may have is \"Why would a restaurant company do this?\"  The answer is pretty simple actually.  Loyalty.  The restaurant business is infamous for extremely high turnover, but the loyalty of Cracker Barrel is legendary in the industry.  You have employees in every job code who have been with the company for years or even decades.  I know servers, grill cooks, dishwashers, retail associates, and maintenance workers who have worked for this company for decades.  I myself have worked for the company since I was 17, and plan to work here until I retire.  The company is very good to its employees, mainly because the company has a culture of internal promotion.  With the exception of the CEO and Chief Legal Officer, the executives who decided how this company was going to handle the pandemic were themselves internally promoted through the corporate hierarchy to reach their current positions.  This is likely why no Cracker Barrel has actually ever tried to unionize.  Those who are running this operation know what it is like to work for the company.  These are the benefits of refusing to franchise.  You keep your best and brightest inside the company, and move them up the ladder as they improve.  Combine the above with a loyal customer base, and you have a borderline recession-proof company. \r\n\r\nI could honestly dedicate an entire thread to why I feel the company is undervalued, but I do not want to cross the line between education and flattery.  When you look at things objectively, the stock is undervalued by quite a lot.  It is almost completely due to the meddling of Biglari Capital Corp and its CEO Sadar Biglari.  For the past nine years Biglari has tried to insert himself onto the company's board.  He has essentially run his company into near bankruptcy trying to wage war on management.  It is actually really sad honestly.

It reads like an angry manchild wrote it.  \r\n\r\nAlas, Biglari has driven his company nearly to the point of bankruptcy trying to fight Cracker Barrel.

The higher dividend yield from SPHD made up for the minimal growth rate in the price of the ETF, while VYM’s price growth allowed it to keep up, and in some cases, be slightly ahead of SPHD.  \r\n\r\nI also calculated for 2015-2020 post-March to see what unstable conditions would do, and here, VYM out performed SPHD by a couple thousand. But, I’m being optimistic and hoping that for the next 5 years, nothing like this happens again. \r\n\r\nI also ran the DRIP calculator on O (Realty Income Corp) Vs. SPHD and VYM and I don’t know what to really think of the results. O’s graph was quite messy compared to the ETFs, but that’s expected considering it’s that O is one sector rather than a diversified ETF. Yet, even post March, it is outperforming both SPHD and VYM. The only thing outperforming all of these was VIG, by one or two thousand dollars by the end of years 2019/2020. \r\n\r\nSo, between VYM, SPHD, and O, I’m thinking of picking a combination of SPHD and O to grow my position over the next few years. I’m a huge fan of the monthly dividend idea and O looks to be a very solid REIT for me. I would just like to know, would VIG be a better choice at my age to hold in Robinhood, or should I put it into a Roth IRA with VTI, VXUS, etc.. the lower yielding, higher growth ETFs, and just hold the higher yielding moderate growth ETFs/REITs in my Robinhood?", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1596112348.0, "tickers": [["O", 5]]}

{"name": "t3_ifj33q", "title": "An open letter to the moderation team regarding this subreddit.", "text": "Dear u/Brintoul and u/AlwaysHavingFun2020,\r\n\r\nHi. Hope you had a nice weekend and are staying safe during this interesting time. I am writing this letter today out of love for this little community carved out in this corner of the internet. \r\n\r\nI'll cut right to the chase. I'm sure you have noticed recently the change taking place in the postings. More and more we are seeing the same posts over and over again, and I think it is high time this subreddit carves out its own unique rules for posting and commenting. No longer do I believe the site wide rules of Reddit are good enough for this community. We have become too large and specialized. As a result, I am officially proposing on behalf of myself a codification of a series of rules, to which I will be detailing below. You may take them or leave them, modify them as you wish, but let the records of the internet show who suggested them.\r\n\r\nPosting rules: \r\n\r\n1. **No self promotion:** Direct links to user-generated YouTube Videos, Blog posts, advertisements, etc. all fall under this category.\r\n\r\n2. **All advice must be given in good faith:** This is a community dedicated to the sharing of genuine advice. As we want to help people prepare for their entire financial future, advice shown to be given in bad faith will be removed with no warning. Repeated violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban.\r\n\r\n3. **No posts encouraging insider trading, violations of SEC/ESMA guidelines, or other unlawful activity.**\r\n\r\n4. **If you want to post an image of your portfolio, the image must come from a certified brokerage:** If you do not feel comfortable displaying the exact value of your holdings, feel free to blur them out.\r\n\r\n5. **Do not critique another user for having a lower share count than you in a particular stock:**  Especially in this economy, people are trying to set aside whatever they can. Don't judge how much other people have in their bank account. You don't know what they are experiencing.\r\n\r\n6. **No referral links:**  Links generated when sharing one's portfolio through brokerages like M1 are exempt. \r\n\r\n**Insider Trading Policy:**  If you are a [Section 16 Officer](https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/officersanddirectors) in any US company, to prevent any conflict of interest, we ask that you please disclose this information when you post, regardless of whether you are talking directly about the company in question. Unique user flairs identifying yourself as a \"Section 16 Officer: $[Ticker Symbol]\" may be handed out at moderator discretion. Posing as a Section 16 Officer, or failing to identify oneself as such in postings may result in actions up to and including a ban. \r\n\r\nThe above rules I officially submit to you moderators. I nominate them to be the bedrock of our new rules. Any users of this subreddit wishing to second the nomination of these rules, please feel free to let your voice be heard in the comments. Please also let me know how I can change the wording to sound better. I just whipped up these rules at 1:30am based upon my immediate recollection of what I have personally seen happen on this sub (minus the Insider Trading Policy, I just think we need that because we deal in stocks.)  \r\n\r\nWill this require more active moderation? Probably. Am I willing to put my money where my mouth is and help moderate?  Yes. Am I just trying to become a mod? No.  I just want this community to succeed.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I and the rest of the community hope to hear from you soon. Stay safe everyone.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFirstclass30\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.

In that letter, I said I was willing to put my money where my mouth is and help moderate.  I am pleased to announce that u/Brintoul has taken me up on my offer.  I am now officially a member of the moderation team.\r\n\r\nI have read through every single comment left on my original letter, and will be working tirelessly to put into practice what was proposed and suggested by both myself, and those who took the time to comment.  As we the mods make these changes, I plan to keep this community informed every step of the way about what we are doing, so that nothing should come as a surprise out of nowhere.  Not every change will be easily noticed (as there will be significant changes on the back end), but don't worry, you will not be kept in the dark.  Below, I will go ahead and list what the agenda looks like right now:\r\n\r\n**What we have already done:**\r\n\r\n\\- Unpinned the Dividend cut list and the stock vote threads, as these had not been maintained for months.\r\n\r\n**What is being done right now as you read this:**\r\n\r\n\\- Official community rules are being drafted as you read this, and will likely show up in the sidebar by the end of the day.  (See below for the working draft of the rules, and feel free to leave a comment on your thoughts about them)  These rules will not be applied retroactively, so don't worry about that. That being said... \r\n\r\n\\- Bans **will** be applied retroactively to users who violated Reddit's site-wide rules regarding harassment, threats, etc.  Those rules existed before today, and you already knew them.  They are not and never have been acceptable in any subreddit, especially one like this dedicated to genuine advice.\r\n\r\n\\- We are taking suggestions from the community about anything and everything in the comments.  I will be reading every single one.  Anything and everything.  From proposed ideas like a dedicated meme day, to logo ideas, whatever you want us to consider.  Upvote what you agree with, you know the drill.\r\n\r\n**Planned actions to be taken over the next seven days:**\r\n\r\n\\- AutoModerator will be brought on board to assist with the more mundane and menial tasks of running the subreddit, so expect to see him in the next few days as we set his parameters for this subreddit.\r\n\r\n\\- An overhaul to the look of the subreddit, and hopefully a custom theme (leave suggestions in the comments) so we don't look like a dead community.\r\n\r\n\\- The integration of community feedback into how this subreddit will be run.\r\n\r\n\\- The creation of a wiki containing an in-depth explanation of the rules, punishments for breaking them.\r\n\r\n\\- A dedicated tab for FAQs about investing.\r\n\r\n**Second draft of the rules:**\r\n\r\n Note: These rules are not yet in effect.  If you disagree with any of them, speak now or forever hold your peace.  I took your suggestions regarding Rule 4 and have updated it to be more clear.\r\n\r\nPosting rules:\r\n\r\n1. **No self promotion:** Direct links to user-generated YouTube Videos, Blog posts, advertisements, etc. all fall under this category.\r\n2. **All advice must be given in good faith:** This is a community dedicated to the sharing of genuine advice. As we want to help people prepare for their entire financial future, advice shown to be given in bad faith will be removed with no warning. Repeated violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban.\r\n3. **No posts encouraging insider trading, violations of SEC/ESMA guidelines, or other unlawful activity.**\r\n4. **No solicitations for due diligence:** Do not create a thread with the specific intention of getting other users to research a company or companies for you.  If you want to start a genuine discussion about a particular company or companies, let us know your thoughts.\r\n5. **Do not critique another user for having a lower share count than you in a particular stock:** Especially in this economy, people are trying to set aside whatever they can.

Below, I will list every change that I have made, and provide details where necessary. Major changes are **in bold**.  Minor changes are *italicized.*\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n1. **Officially codified subreddit specific rules**: You can check them on the sidebar.  They went into effect at 00:00 on 26 August, and will not be applied retroactively, as this sub has an 11 year history and nobody has time for that.  If anyone is curious, it took 35 minutes for someone to violate Rule 1.  Make sure to check the insider trading policy and AMA policy.\r\n2. **Retroactively enforced Reddit's site-wide rules, clearing out the six year backlog of user reported violations**: Bans were administered to individuals who were repeatedly violating Reddit site-wide rules against threats, harassment, etc.\r\n3. **The spam filter strength for the subreddit has been changed to \"high.\"** This is the default setting.  I have no idea why it was changed to low.  Reddit has an automated system that can catch about 80% of spam on its own.  Normally it works pretty well, but I will keep an eye on it and am able to overrule it if the bot makes a mistake.\r\n4. **Introduced a minimum and maximum post title limit of 10 characters and 240 characters respectively**: This is designed to further aid in the abolition of spam in this subreddit. I noticed most of the spam appeared to violate these parameters, so this is designed to make my life easier and hopefully not inconvenience anyone. (Note: this applies to post titles only, not the contents of submissions). \r\n5. **Implemented a repost frequency to cut down on spam:** In layman's speak, the same URL cannot be posted over and over again.  Reddit will prohibit the post from being published.  The current time limit is two weeks.  \r\n6. **Automoderator is now activated:** I had to teach myself how to imput the functions to make it do what I wanted, but now it seems to be working.  I'm not going to tell you what it is looking for, because then you would find a way to evade its detection.  Just don't worry about him.\r\n7. *Suggested sort changed from \"none\" to \"best.\"*\r\n8. *Changed the community name.*\r\n9. *Added community topics to feed the Reddit algorithm.*\r\n10. *Changed community description.*\r\n11. *Added Welcome message that will be sent to all new users when they join the community.*\r\n12. *Changed the upvote and downvote colors to the official shades of green and red used by the NYSE because why not.*\r\n13. *Created a poll on the look of the subreddit.  Go vote* [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/igrw6o/poll_on_the_look_of_the_subreddit_open_until_sept/).  You guys requested it.\r\n14. *Created post flairs.*\r\n15. *Created user flairs.*  More will be added as time progresses. ***Note:*** To those of you who have left feedback and suggested changes that I adopted, you will find a custom user flair in your settings as my way of saying thank you for helping contribute to this subreddit.  I am a firm believer in giving credit where it is due, so you guys can take credit for changing this subreddit.  These custom userboxes are green.  You are free to use them, or not use them.  It doesn't matter to me.\r\n16. Reformatted the sidebar.\r\n17. **Added custom community awards**:  These awards were quietly rolled out a few hours ago, and already some have begun to use them.  They are completely optional (and impossible to profit from).  They can be found in the \"community\" tab when you wish to award a post.  I added them because I figured there were those out there who want the ability to recognize the valuable contributions of others.  The Reddit coins the subreddit receives will be gifted out to users who make meaningful posts.  \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThat is about it for all the changes made so far.  Now to answer your most frequently asked questions sent through modmail and my DMs.\r\n\r\n**Q. Will posts have to be approved beforehand by the moderators?** \r\n\r\n*A. No.  There is no whitelisting system in place and there are currently no plans to whitelist submissions.*\r\n\r\n**Q. How will bans work?  Are you going to abuse permabans like other subreddits?**\r\n\r\n*A. Ideally, the only permanent bans will be given to bots.  When a user violates the subreddit rules, their post will be removed with an explanation given.  Continued intentional violations will result in a 72 hour ban.  If the violation persists, the ban will be extended to 7, 30, then 365 days.  Only beyond that point will a permanent ban be considered.  When violating Reddit's sitewide rules, 30 day bans will be the default after the warning stage.  Bots will be permanently banned with no warnings.*\r\n\r\n**Q.

I've turned it back off, but I may turn it on again based on the community feedback.*\r\n\r\n**Q. Is meta discussion allowed?**\r\n\r\n*A. Yes.  Meta discussion is encouraged.  I want to make this subreddit better, so any and all feedback is appreciated.*\r\n\r\n**Q. Can you ban (insert username) for violating the rules?**\r\n\r\n*A. If you believe someone has violated the rules of this subreddit, please report them and they will be dealt with accordingly.  The moderators toolbox allows me to see every user reported violation.  I have no way to view every single comment and post though.  So if you see something, report it.  I have no way to view who reports a post, so you can be assured your reports are anonymous.*\r\n\r\n**Q. Anything I can do to help?**\r\n\r\n*A. Participate.  This subreddit is driven by its users.

For those unfamiliar, all three are considered **GSE's** (**Government-Sponsored Enterprises)**.\r\n\r\n2) **What does a GSE do?**\r\n\r\nBasically GSE's act as secondary markets for mortgages and loans. In the primary market, a primary lender writes up a mortgage. This mortgage (or an asset of these mortgages) can then be sold to a secondary lender. The reason why these secondary lenders exist is because they are able to reduce the cost of capital on these mortgages/loans, making them more accessible to the general population.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a GSE like Farmer Mac improves access to credit.\r\n\r\n3) **But wait, doesn't that mean GSE's take on toxic mortgage assets?**\r\n\r\nIn general, yes.\r\n\r\nBut there's a catch. Both the primary lenders that AGM purchases the bulk of these agriculture loans/assets from (the **Farm Credit System**) as well as AGM itself are both regulated by the **Farm Credit Association.**\r\n\r\nThe Farm Credit Association is an independent agency of the federal government which exists to regulate the financial institutions that provide credit to farmers.\r\n\r\nIn light of the Great Recession, the farm credit association has made tremendous leaps in ensuring **only the most conservative underwriting measures** to reduce the risk of default on these loans.\r\n\r\n**FINANCIALS**\r\n\r\nNow, here's the juicy part and why I think this is such a good investment. All this info is copy-pasted straight from their Q1 update:\r\n\r\n* Provided $1.3 billion in liquidity and lending capacity in first quarter 2020, resulting in net outstanding business volume growth of $421.4 million;\r\n* Net income attributable to common stockholders was $9.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share;\r\n* • Core earnings, a non-GAAP measure was $20.1 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share;\r\n* • Net interest income grew $0.7 million year-over-year to $41.3 million;\r\n* • Net effective spread, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14% from the prior-year period to $44.2 million;\r\n* **• 90-day delinquencies were 0.37% of total outstanding business volume as of March 31, 2020**\r\n* **First quarter provision for credit losses of $3.8 million, largely driven by expected COVID-19 impact.**\r\n\r\nLook at that provision for credit loss. It's only $3.8 million.That's **0.09%** of their outstanding business volume. That's nothing at all. This means they don't expect to face significant losses on their assets.\r\n\r\n**Dividend**\r\n\r\n* AGM has a near 5% dividend yield with a payout ratio of \\~35%\r\n* AGM recently raised the dividend from 0.70 per quarter to 0.80 per quarter\r\n\r\n**LONG TERM OUTLOOK**\r\n\r\n* U.S. government won't allow farmers to suffer tremendous losses on their loans. Agriculture is a heavily subsidized industry and massive losses on agricultural mortgages and loans would be a huge detriment to the U.S.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** Dividend yield is nearly 5% with very low payout ratio (\\~35%). The loans serviced are in the agriculture industry which is as safe as it gets (government won't let farmers fail to make payments on their loans). Revenue has been steadily increasing over time. Low interest rate environment provides good time to get in on this stock as income on interest spread can only get better over time.", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1598538557.0, "tickers": [["AGM", 7]]}

(Plus some very important announcements)", "text": "Good afternoon r/dividends,\r\n\r\nA lot has been happening behind the scenes recently regarding the state of this subreddit, so I will skip any buildup and get right into it.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would like to officially welcome Jack Larkin (aka u/finance_student), who has officially joined the moderator team.   I have brought him on to help turn Automoderator into more than just my copy-pasting default templates in a pattern that somehow works.  So be nice, be kind, and wish him luck because I have no idea how to code.\r\n\r\nThe second order of business is that I am officially hiring not one, not two, but **three additional moderators** for r/dividends.  Unlike Jack, these individuals will be active and participating members of the community who will be brought on to accomplish very specific tasks.  The three positions are each very different, and listed below.  Please read each one carefully.\r\n\r\n1. **Old Reddit Ambassador**: As many of you know, I have absolutely zero experience coding anything complicated.  Unfortunately for me, Old Reddit does not care.  Anyone who has worked with Old Reddit knows the stylesheet page is simply a blank text box responsive to (I think) CSS code.  According to Reddit statistics, a large number of r/dividends userbase utilizes either Old Reddit, or 3rd party Reddit apps that are pulling data from Old Reddit.  I am fully committed to ensuring you guys have just as positive of a user experience as those of us who use new Reddit, so I am recruiting an experienced Reddit coder to assist in this task.  In essence, you would help me make r/dividends look good on Old Reddit and its third party apps.  That's all this position is.  You will serve as an ambassador to that community, and make sure our Old Reddit userw are having a great user experience.  You will not need to handle the mod queue or work on automoderator.\r\n2. **Wiki Writer:** Another important goal of mine for this subreddit is the establishment of a wiki for any and all new dividend investors.  It will be an introductory guide walking new investors through everything they need to know to get started, so that hopefully I can eliminate every single \"Im X years old and don't know how to invest\" post.  Excellent writing skills will be required.\r\n\r\n3. **Chat moderator:**  We are pleased to announce that [/r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends) is now live on Discord. Come join the conversation in our live chatroom!  To facilitate the live chat, we have partnered with other finance related subreddits and are joining an already established and very active server. Our new server hosts the official chats for [/r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading), [/r/forex](https://www.reddit.com/r/forex), and the FXGears communities, and boasts more than 1600 online members.  Our channels within the chat server are #dividend-investing and the #stocks-general / #stock-resources rooms, but of course you are encouraged to check out all subject matters hosted on the server.  You can find links to the new chat in the top navigational bar and the sidebar.  Individuals applying for this position would be responsible for overseeing the chat on these new channels.  You would be granted moderator status here on the subreddit and would be granted permissions necessary to enforce the rules accross both platforms. \r\n\r\nThose of you who wish to apply may send an application through modmail.  Applications will be open until Tuesday September 1, when I will start contacting the finalists. \r\n\r\nEdit: it was asked if mods were still allowed to participate in the community (apparently some subreddits want their mods to not interact with the subreddit unless they are acting as a mod.) I don't know what subreddits do that, but rest assured such a rule would not apply here. Any mods would still be free to post, comment, rate, etc. All the fun stuff. You can just think of being a mod as a side thing you do on the weekends or something if you want to. All I really need is people with the requisite skills who want to make the community better. You will get a custom flair of whatever you want, and you will get to help make this community a better place. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThat concludes todays announcement.

In times we are in, I take emphasis on these ratios. \r\n\r\n4) Of course what I am here for is the 1.86% dividend yield. While this stock won't get neck snapping returns like the rest of the market, I am guaranteed this dividend if we go into a long and deep recession/depression. There is only 1 larger competitor (Republic Services), but I think WM barely can call itself a duopoly and think they are one of the safest stocks for yield.\r\n\r\nI am open to any thoughts and suggestions.

Prior to discovering and really understanding dividends and how they work I had no savings whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI was living more or less by a day to day philosophy and not thinking too heavily about the future, mainly because it seemed stressful and demoralising knowing that I wouldn’t be able to realistically retire early or live life from a passive income stand point perhaps until I received my pension.. in 30+years.\r\n\r\nMy only real get out in my head was perhaps winning a bet or the lottery, which hadn’t gone well thus far. \r\n\r\nI then came across dividend growth strategies from a few different content creators and began to read books on investing and became hooked on the whole outlook. \r\n\r\nThe possibility of actually being able to live life without actively working whilst maintaining the same lifestyle became a real possibility with some dedication. I have a decent job with above average income but never had any discipline or a direct target, until now.\r\n\r\nI’m starting from the ground up, every deposit into my portfolio has been an achievement and territory that i have never been in before in terms of saving/investing. \r\n\r\nI was never taught much about finance,investing or saving growing up so trying my best to absorb everything I can from everything and everyone. \r\n\r\nI hope that I can inspire others as I have been and would like to share my journey with whoever is interested here anyhow. \r\n\r\nI am using Trading 212 as a platform and have now accumulated £6200 in my portfolio consisting mainly of dividend stocks. I know it’s not much to some but it’s a start for me and a small achievement for myself.\r\n\r\nI have just began a channel to track the journey on YouTube, if you have any spare time check it out and let me know what you think!

This post will be linked somewhere as an FAQ of sorts for any individual who has questions about the rules of this subreddit.  These rules were developed through feedback and dialogue with the community, so they are enforced with vigor.  Feedback is always accepted in regards to the rules, so they should not be considered unchangeable.  If this community wants a rule change, make a post under the \"Meta\" flair, and make a compelling argument.  If the community approves, I (the moderator who enforces the rules) will change the rules.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**1. No self Promotion:** Posting to promote user-generated YouTube videos, blog posts, advertisements, websites, surveys, etc. all fall under this category.\r\n\r\nQ. *What does this rule cover?*\r\n\r\nA. \"Hey guys, check out my \\[insert content here\\].\"  In all seriousness, We do not care what it is.  If you made it, you do not get to post it here.  End of discussion.\r\n\r\n*Q. What exceptions are there to this rule?  Every rule has exceptions right?*\r\n\r\nNone.  The etc. is meant to cover every possible form of self-promotion imaginable.  Surveys, cryptocurrencies, and \"professional\" hacking services are just some of the things posted here that I have removed under the [etcetera](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/etcetera) clause.\r\n\r\n>**2. All advice must be given in good faith:** This is a community dedicated to the sharing of genuine advice. As we want to help people prepare for their entire financial future, advice shown to be given in bad faith will be removed with no warning. Repeated violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban.\r\n\r\nThe definition of what advice is considered good faith is very hard to pin down, as there are some people who genuinely have no idea how to invest, yet are trying to help other people invest.  As such, I have been reluctant to remove posts for this reason.  I tend to leave enforcement of this rule up to Automoderator, using its filters and Reddit's aggressive site-wide spam filters.\r\n\r\nOne example of a time where I did not sit on the sidelines and removed a comment directly under this rule was when a user suggested the best way to get rich was to take out a seven figure loan, load up on T and MO, then use the dividends to pay off the loan.  Any experienced or even beginner investor could tell you dozens of things wrong with this idea, and judging by the user's post history, it was clear the post was not in good faith, so it was removed.\r\n\r\n>**3.**  **No encouraging insider trading, violations of SEC/ESMA guidelines, or other unlawful activity**\r\n\r\nPerhaps the simplest rule to understand.  Do not suggest people do illegal things.  Plain and simple.  When determining what is legal or not, I am looking at US and EU laws primarily, as well as laws from places like Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, etc.\r\n\r\nSo if you are a member of the LGBT+ community, do not worry.  I will not remove your comment if you mention being gay or something like that.  Or if there are any third world countries out there with some obscure law against owning too many goats or whatever, you goat hoarders can rest easy.\r\n\r\n>**4. No solicitations for due diligence:** Do not create a thread with the specific intention of getting other users to research a company or companies for you. If you want to start a genuine discussion about a particular company or companies, let us know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThis rule is the most commonly violated by a mile and a half.  Nearly 40% of all posts and comments removed by me violate this rule.  No other rule comes within 10 percentage points in terms of rule violations.  This is also the rule that went through the most revisions when the rules were being developed.  It is the main reason I am even writing this post, so let me explain it.\r\n\r\nRule Four is designed to prevent posts like this one:\r\n\r\n>**AT&T**  \r\n>  \r\n>Looks like a great stock.  Anyone here own it?  Seems high on the analysts lists too\r\n\r\nNotice the title is the name of a random company (changed to protect the OPs privacy) and the description devoid of details.  While I did not contact the user who posted this, I can guess their intentions were for someone to research the company for them and tell them if it was a good investment or not.  This is an almost textbook definition of a solicitation for due diligence.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean you are not allowed to ask other users for their thoughts when posting.  Quite the opposite.  Every post should be taken as an invitation for other users to share their thoughts.  The way to not break this rule is really simple.  Give people something interesting to talk about.  Or if you want a more nuanced explanation, tell people what you know about the company or companies and try to spark a genuine discussion.\r\n\r\n[This is a gold standard example of how to spark discussion about a company.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/il030b/waste_management_recession_proof_stock/) I link this post by u/ForehandFinancial to demonstrate how easy it is to post something good, substantive, and high-quality.  It makes you want to scroll down and read the comments.  Notice how they have already done their due diligence, citing numbers, and states they are looking for additional thoughts and suggestions not previously considered.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**5. Do not critique another user based on the size of their portfolio:** Especially in this economy, people are trying to set aside whatever they can. Do not judge how much other people have in their bank account. You do not know what they are experiencing.\r\n\r\nI hate how this has to be a rule, but unfortunately some people are just rude to each other.  Reddit has site-wide rules against harassment and threats.  This is just a refinement of that rule into an investing community mindset.  Pretty self explanatory.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**6. No referral links**:  Links generated when sharing one's portfolio through brokerages like M1 are exempt.\r\n\r\nThis could technically loop back around into Rule 1, as it is self-promotion.  Most brokerages have these, and will give you money or stocks if you convince someone to sign up using them.  Some brokerages also have a button that allows you to share your portfolio.  For example, [this is my M1 Portfolio](https://m1.finance/wbI3wBr2ioGc).  If I could remove the link I would, but since I cannot, these kinds of links are allowed since they have a separate purpose.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**7. No low effort posts:**  Low effort could be loosely defined as those posts which could be theoretically created in under sixty seconds. It can also be defined as any post which took a sub-minimal amount of effort to create.\r\n\r\nAnother very subjective rule, though I am not sure really how to make it objective.  On this one, I tend to defer to the community.  If enough people are reporting this post as low effort and I agree, then the post will be removed for low effort.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**8. No unauthorized bots:**  Bots that lack the authority to operate on [r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/) will be banned permanently with no warning. Bots which are determined to not contribute meaningfully will be classified as unauthorized.\r\n\r\nIf you want your bot to be allowed on r/dividends, then send a message through modmail and we will discuss it.  Every day Automoderator is removing bot posts.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nTo close, here is a statistic some of you may find interesting.  Whenever I remove a post or comment, I give a reason.

All 3 have ex-dividend dates in the next month. I hope you find this useful, and please let me know your thoughts in the comments!\r\n\r\n# First Horizon National Corp. (FHN)\r\n\r\nFounded in 1864, First Horizon National Corporation (ticker: FHN) is a bank holding company based in Memphis, Tennessee. Its banking subsidiary, First Horizon, is the largest bank in Tennessee and the fourth largest regional bank in Southeast USA. They employ over 5000 employees at over 250 bank locations across the Southeast of the US.\r\n\r\n*Key points:*\r\n\r\n**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 10th September 2020\r\n\r\n**Dividend Yield**\r\n\r\nCurrently, FHN has a Dividend Yield of 6.02%. This a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. FHN paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $6.40 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 40% from that low.\r\n\r\n**Dividend Payout Ratio: 62.37%**\r\n\r\nIdeally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - however, FHN have a history of paying a steadily increasing dividend. For 14 years – from 1993 to 2007, FHN increased their dividend yearly – with the only exception being 2000-2001 when they maintained it. Furthermore, from 2011 to the present, FHN have increased their dividend yearly – with the only exception being 2013-2014 when they maintained it.\r\n\r\n**Price to Book Ratio: 0.60**\r\n\r\nAs of July 2020, FHN stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.60, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $16.67, with a share price of $9.96 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $9.60). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.\r\n\r\n**Institutional Ownership**\r\n\r\nFHN have 57.60% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.\r\n\r\n# Valley National Bancorp (VLY)\r\n\r\nFounded in 1927, Valley National Bancorp (ticker: VLY) is a bank holding company based in Wayne, New Jersey. Its banking subsidiary, Valley Bank, currently operates over 230 branch locations in northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, as well as Long Island, Florida, and Alabama. They employ over 3000 employees.\r\n\r\n*Key points:*\r\n\r\n**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 14th September 2020\r\n\r\n**Dividend Yield**\r\n\r\nCurrently, VLY has a Dividend Yield of 5.61%. Like FHN, this is also a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. VLY paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $6.02 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 16% from that low.\r\n\r\n**Dividend Payout Ratio: 56.90%**\r\n\r\nIdeally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - however, VLY have maintained their dividend for the past 5 years, with the stock price largely stable during this time as well. According to Zacks, of the 8 analysts tracking VLY – 4 recommended it as a ‘Buy’, 3 as a ‘Hold’ and just one as a ‘Sell’. The average price target is currently $9.22, which is a decent upside of about $2 per share.\r\n\r\n**Price to Book Ratio: 0.71**\r\n\r\nAs of July 2020, VLY stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.71, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $11.08, with a share price of $7.82 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $7.46). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.\r\n\r\n**Institutional Ownership**\r\n\r\nVLY have 61.90% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.\r\n\r\n# Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV)\r\n\r\nFounded in 1888, Synovus Financial Corporation (ticker: SNV) is a bank holding company based in Columbus, Georgia. Its banking subsidiary, Synovus Bank, operates 294 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. They employ over 5000 employees. Other non-bank subsidiaries that are wholly-owned by SNV include Synovus Securities, Synovus Trust, Synovus Mortgage, Creative Financial Group and Global One.\r\n\r\n*Key points:*\r\n\r\n**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 16th September 2020\r\n\r\n**Dividend Yield**\r\n\r\nCurrently, SNV has a Dividend Yield of 5.96%. Again, this is a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. SNV paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $12.12 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 70% from that low.\r\n\r\n**Dividend Payout Ratio: 48.60%**\r\n\r\nIdeally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - so the Dividend Payout Ratio of 48.60% for SNV is exactly what we want to see. In addition to this, SNV have a history of paying a steadily increasing dividend. For 14 years – from 1993 to 2007, SNV increased their dividend yearly without fail. Furthermore, from 2013 to the present, SNV have increased their dividend yearly.\r\n\r\n**Price to Book Ratio: 0.60**\r\n\r\nAs of July 2020, SNV stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.60, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $34.30, with a share price of $20.53 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $21.78). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.\r\n\r\n**Institutional Ownership**\r\n\r\nSNV have a whopping 81.00% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.\r\n\r\nOn 4 August 2020, Synovus also announced a donation of $1 million to UNCF (United Negro College Fund) to set up The Synovus / Calvin Smyre Scholarship Campaign. The fund will include scholarships in Synovus' five-state presence for African American students to attend historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other higher education institutions.

Will it be the permanent logo?  I have no idea.  If you have a better logo, send it to me.  I was tired of looking at the default Saturn with rings.  So I spent ten minutes and fixed it.  The logo is very similar to the r/stocks logo, except for a few key modifications I photo-shopped.  \r\n\r\nFirstly, the suit is blue (because blue suits are objectively better).  Second, the image on the billboard is taken directly from Figure 8 of this [Hartford Funds research paper on the power of dividends](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/market-perspectives/the-power-of-dividends.html).  In effect, this is a subtle reference that dividend stocks are objectively better than the so-called \"growth stocks.\"  Finally, the snoovatar's left arm has been moved to its side, because this investor has a dividend growth portfolio, so he does not need to manage his money as actively as the investor in the r/stocks logo.  \r\n\r\n(side note: reading this out loud to my wife.  Her opinion is that she is glad I have found a hobby, but is slightly concerned.  Not with my investment philosophy, but with my determination to this subreddit. She always says I put too much effort into things I enjoy even slightly.  Thanks r/dividends)\r\n\r\nFinal thing. R/dividends has custom community awards. When you use them, the community itself receives coins. A few people have been using them, but I really want to be able to use the community awards system to give away premium to those who make the most valuable contributions.

Banking services include commercial, consumer, and real estate financing, business and personal deposit services, ATM's, Internet banking Services, trust and employee benefit plan services. \r\n\r\n**The Stock**\r\n\r\nCurrently MCBC is trading at $6.35 versus a book value of $6.37. Year to date, MCBC is down 42.95% compared to the iShares US Regional Banks ETF down 32.51%. MCBC is currently yielding 5% with a payout ratio of 36.36% for 3 months ending June 30th. Their payout ratio for 2019 was 30%. \r\n\r\n**Behind the Scenes**\r\n\r\nThe CET1 ratio compares a bank's capital to its assets, measuring how well capitalized a bank is to withstand unexpected losses. Currently MCBC has a CET1 ratio of 14.9% meaning they are well capitalized, compared to the industry average of 12%. The minimum set by the Basel III Accord is 7%.  They have a Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 14.9%, compared to the 8.5% minimum allowed. \r\n\r\nSince 2015, MCBC has enjoyed increasing revenue every year, growing from $65.4 million in 2015 to $83.7 million in 2019. Likewise, they have seen increasing net income every year since 2015, with 12.8 million in 2015 to 32 million in 2019.  They have a safe debt to equity (D/E) ratio of .90 for 6 months ending June 30th, 2020. For 2019, their D/E ratio was .89. \r\n\r\nEven with interest rates being near zero, the increase in mortgages helped MCBC beat expectations in Q2. Ronald Hann, CEO, stated \"Despite the challenging environment in the second quarter of 2020, we produced $7.6 million in earnings for the quarter.  Mortgage gains in the second quarter of 2020 were three times higher than a year ago and more than offset the reduction in net interest income caused by the significant decrease in market interest rates in 2020.\"\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this is an extremely attractive entry point for MCBC, even with the inherent risk they carry being a regional bank. They are capitalized extremely well, leaving them plenty of room to continue to pay their dividend, and along with their strong balance sheet, are well positioned to weather out this market environment.", "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "created_utc": 1601171410.0, "tickers": [["MCBC", 6], ["III", 1]]}

I just reached my goal of $1250 a year in dividends, now shooting for $2k a year. I have just shy of $25k invested and have gone from YOLO'ing money into the market to making much more informed decisions. My next goal is to have $50k total invested in the next 5 years. Disclaimer: This is broad information I have learned on my journey through investing. I have tried to do my research but cannot guarantee everything below is 100% up to speed. You should always do your own research as well !\r\n\r\nThe portfolio: https://m1.finance/SueDRtc7ioXN\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind here is that this is not strictily a dividend portfolio. It also contains elements geared toward growth. The idea being that somewhere down the line ill harvest the growth and dump it into more income generating assets when im older. The weighted percentage of the allocations as they are now is also simply a reflection of how I want auto-invest to spread out the money. The actual weight of the individual holdings is slightly different.\r\n\r\nIf you want a really well thought out portfolio that is strictly geared toward generating income with a low expense ratio, opportunities for appreciation and low volatility I highly recommend checking out this portfolio put together by rao-blackwell-ized on the M1 finance subreddit. https://m1.finance/HwnAhLIW6Mp6\r\n\r\nYou can read about the methodology behind his creation of this pie [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/M1Finance/comments/go08t3/i_created_a_dividend_pie_for_you_guys/) which is a highly worthy post on its own. \r\n\r\n**Tax efficiency** \r\n\r\nYou should start by maxing out an IRA or at the very least contributing to one. Dividends earned in traditional IRAs are not taxed when they are paid or reinvested, rather retirement account withdrawals are taxed at one's current income tax when they are withdrawn. Roth IRA funds grow tax-exempt, including the payment of dividends, and so these are not subject to taxation.\r\n\r\nFor me personally I just picked a target date fund in my IRA and let it ride. I wanted to pursue dividend investing in a taxable account so that I could use the dividends if I wanted to to supplement my current income. The perfect example being back in march when I was furloughed and it took forever to get on unemployment. My dividends bought groceries that month. \r\n\r\nYou have to ask yourself what YOU want and what your goals are for dividend investing. Now onto the meat and potatoes of the post !\r\n\r\n**Qualified vs Non qualified dividends** \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two types of ordinary dividends: qualified and nonqualified. The most significant difference between the two is that nonqualified dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates, while qualified dividends receive more favorable tax treatment by being taxed at capital gains rates.\r\n\r\nWhat classifies a dividend as ‘qualified’ for tax purposes?\r\n\r\n Ordinary dividends are the most common type of distribution from a corporation or a mutual fund - as they are paid out of earnings and profits. Examples of ordinary dividends that do not qualify for preferential tax treatment include:\r\n\r\n* Generally, dividends paid out by real estate investment trusts (there are instances where dividends can be considered qualified, provided certain requirements are met - - See IRC §857(c))\r\nGenerally, dividends paid out by master limited partnerships (However, if the MLP is invested in qualifying corporations and it receives qualified dividends from those investments, it would pass out qualified dividends to the partners)\r\n* Dividends paid on employee stock option plans\r\n* Dividends paid by tax-exempt companies\r\n* Dividends paid on savings or money market accounts by mutual savings banks, mutual insurance companies, credit unions and other loan associations\r\n\r\nI see alot of people investing heavily into REIT's because of their attractive yield. Thats well and fine if you know what you're buying but keep in mind REIT's are taxed at a higher rate than other dividends and some can carry volatility because of the assets they invest in (shopping malls, brick and mortar retail etc.) For this reason it is my opinion that REIT's should only be held in tax differed accounts like an IRA to maximize your tax efficiency. Bonds are a good alternative to REIT's. The yield might not be as high but they're much more stable. \r\n\r\n**Choosing stocks vs index funds** \r\n\r\nThere are alot of great companies out there paying attractive yields but you shouldnt get caught up chasing the yield if the company itself is performing poorly. If the company does not have the fundamentals to support its dividend then you could be at risk of it lowering or disappearing all together down the line. \r\n\r\nI would take a lower yield from a company with a track record for growth and increasing its dividend every time over a company with a high yield but is struggling to support itself. In a buy and hold type setting, you want to ensure that what you pick is set up for long term success. \r\n\r\nThe [Dividend aristocrats](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-aristocrats/) are a good place to look for quality companies that have a history of increasing dividends.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to my point in choosing what to invest in. If you dont have the time or willingness to track individual stocks, then I highly recommend just going with a broad index fund approach. The yield may be lower but ETF's are inherently more resilient against downturns and market volatility since theyre a package deal of many individual holdings and can provide easy diversity in your portfolio. One thing to keep in mind though is overlap. If you invest in multiple index funds theres a good chance those ETF's may hold positions of the same stock. Thats fine if you're ok with increased exposure to that particular holding but it IS something to be aware of. \r\n\r\nYou can use the fund overlap tool at https://www.etfrc.com/index.php to see the overlap in your index funds.\r\n\r\n**Expense ratios**\r\n\r\nThese fees — inherent in all mutual funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds — can significantly drag down your portfolio returns. And although they can’t be avoided completely if you invest in these funds, you can take steps to keep these costs as low as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat is an expense ratio?\r\nAn expense ratio is an annual fee expressed as a percentage of your investment — or, like the term implies, the ratio of your investment that goes toward the fund’s expenses. If you invest in a mutual fund with a 1% expense ratio, you’ll pay the fund $10 per year for every $1,000 invested. That money is swept out of your investment in the fund, meaning you won’t get a bill for the charge. That’s one reason why these fees are easy to miss. Looking for funds with low expense ratios is key to making sure your making the most efficient use of your money.\r\n\r\n**Bonds and Treasuries** \r\n\r\nThis is an often overlooked area in dividend investing. While bonds pay interest as opposed to a dividend meaning theyre taxed at your normal income rate, they carry much more stability than REIT's. Treasuries and municipal bonds may also be exempt from federal or state taxes all together depending on a number of factors.\r\n \r\n* Interest income generated by municipal bond funds is generally not subject to federal taxes, and may also be exempt from state and local taxes if the bonds held by the fund were issued by the state in which you live.\r\n\r\n* Funds that exclusively hold U.S. Treasury bonds may be exempt from state taxes. \r\n\r\nBonds represent the debts of issuers, such as companies or governments. These debts are sliced up and sold to investors in smaller units - for instance, a $1 million debt issue may be allocated to one-thousand $1,000 bonds. In general, bonds are considered to be more conservative investments than stocks, and are more senior to stocks if an issuer declares bankruptcy. Bonds also typically pay regular interest payments to investors, and return the full principal loaned when the bond matures. As a result, bond prices vary inversely with interest rates, falling when rates go up and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nThe bond markets are a very liquid and active, but can take second seat to stocks for many retail or part time investors. It is often for professional investors, pension and hedge funds, and financial advisors, but that doesn't mean that part-time investors should steer clear of bonds. In fact, bonds play an increasingly important part in your portfolio as you age and, because of that, learning about them now makes good financial sense. In fact having a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds is advisable for investors of all ages and risk tolerance.\r\n\r\nIm comfortable with paying a higher tax rate on bonds because I know theyre stable and can provide a safe harbor to generate income while preserving capital against downturns and inflation.\r\n\r\n**In conclusion**\r\n\r\nDividend investing can be a great way to pursue your financial goals. The thing you have to remember about investing in general is that regardless of your approach or strategy it is simply a financial vehicle to get you from point A to B. Understanding the fundamentals of dividend investing (your tax liability, what to invest in, your risk tolerance etc) are all important factors to figure out before you yeet your money into the ether of the market.

I will be able to re-invest into my business and lower my tax burden but at some point with no personal or business debt I am running out of ideas to reduce the tax burden. I only want to grow the business large enough to meet my investing goals. I have a family and don’t want to commit any more time to business than necessary. In my mind I can feed this portfolio a large chunk of my business profits and active income to help create another income stream that I can tap into later in life re-investing dividends until then. I think this portfolio would definitely be more tax efficient as a Roth IRA but I would like to have access to the dividends before retirement age since my other accounts will be off limits until age 59 1/2. If everything continues to go well I shouldn’t need to work until retirement age unless I want to.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, how does this portfolio look? My goal is to try to match avg. market gains over a 20yr period but with a higher dividend yield, maybe with a little less volatility. I’ve targeted companies that seem to be growing their dividend consistently with potential still for capital growth. I do realize that REITs weigh in at 25% and I understand the implications of that.

Some may ask, u/DeepHouseGod, why would you initiate a position in a company that's recently cut their dividend and has a terrible balance sheet?\r\n\r\nHere's why:\r\n\r\n* Even with the dividend cut, I still locked in a starting yield of 7.5%. Even if BP suffers another 50% cut, i'm still looking at a 3.56% starting yield.\r\n* The price of oil is going to recover eventually, and as the USA (and world) eventually reopens completely, oil demand will increase. This will help them pick up pieces from the oil crisis/COVID-19 and help them expand their business or increase dividends.\r\n* Even in their depressed state, their market cap is $56 billion. In a market where smaller fish are being snapped up (see COP looking to buy CXO) or dying out, BP is still well positioned and is a major player.\r\n* The company says it wants to have net-zero emissions by 2050.\r\n* Value stocks in general have been under-preforming growth and this trend won't last forever.\r\n* BP is vertically integrated.\r\n* Operations in 78 countries, so they have excellent geographic diversity.\r\n* They have significant renewable energy exposure (biofuels, wind, smart grid, and solar) and are looking to expand their stakes in renewables to ensure they remain viable.\r\n* They're actively trying to increase their exposure to renewable energy.\r\n* BP owns a 19.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, the largest publicly traded oil company in the world based on hydrocarbon reserves.\r\n* They're finished paying for the 2010 Gulf oil spill.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have no problem buying when there's fear in the oil market. Let's be honest, the oil & gas industry isn't going anywhere, even with the push towards renewables. Will we see even more industry consolidation? Probably. If we want to think of how the major energy companies can expand their businesses and become more viable long term, consider the following:\r\n\r\nThe oil & gas sector is still significantly larger than the renewable energy sector by market cap. There are many intriguing small cap companies in the renewable sector that would make fantastic acquisition targets for oil giants such as BP in the future. The fact is that many of these oil giants would be better served to simply buy and integrate renewable companies into their existing business than trying to develop tech on their own. This is how I foresee the oil majors remaining relevant into the future as the world's dependence on oil decreases.\r\n\r\nI am curious to hear what other dividend investors think about BP, the energy sector as a whole, and the direction it's heading. I think for an industry that's (still) filled with a juicy yields, it warrants a serious discussion.\r\n\r\nHappy investing y'all!\r\n\r\n(Disclosure: Long BP)", "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "created_utc": 1602736859.0, "tickers": [["BP", 7], ["COP", 1]]}

Only stocks are okay.\r\n\r\nI was initially thinking to spread my starting portfolio to these companies 2k each:\r\n\r\n*stock (divs) = reason why interested*\r\n\r\n**HRZN** (9%) = because it invest to startups, so inherently different to REITs etc.\r\n\r\n**TRSWF** (5,29%) = renewables with dividends, take my monies \r\n\r\n(is CWEN (4,21 %) better than TRSWF?)\r\n\r\n**ARR** (12,31%) = mREIT, adding some typical mREIT with high yield, price is also low after covid19, but the trust seems to be still breathing. Any comments about their future?\r\n\r\n**T** (7,58%) = Aristocrat with some stability\r\n\r\n**MAIN** (8,24%) = Capital trust, and also very long track record.\r\n\r\nThis portfolio would have avg dividend of 8.484 %.\r\n\r\nI could also add 1-3 more by reducing the amount I invest to one stock, but I pay around 10 dollars for fees when I buy, so don't wan't my fees go over 1%.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for better picks or comments about companies welcome. Or if you would add something else, it would be welcome also. \r\n\r\nI am also interested in Gladstones: LAND, GOOD, GAIN, GLAD. Any comments about them? :)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for help!", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "created_utc": 1602841148.0, "tickers": [["CWEN", 1], ["ACC", 1]]}

I hate to sell... But they say don't buy an ETF if you wouldn't buy the stocks contained within and I do believe that's accurate. Why would I ever buy stock in H&R Block?\r\n\r\n Here is what I bought with the proceeds:\r\n\r\nMore O. Price dip looked good and they are excellent stewards of their assets. Hard to think of a more shareholder-focused REIT. Their IG companies will always maintain a store presence. I want a lot more of them at these rates.\r\n\r\nMore GOOD. One of my only \"buy the dip always\" small cap REITs. Gladstone is a fine businessman who is moving the trust to more industrial holdings. *Trustworthy* is how I describe him. Collects high fees but never, ever lets shareholders down.\r\n\r\nBNL. They performed well when they were private and recently IPO'd. Expecting a 6% yield with this diversified trust *with* price increase. I think this sub should look into them more since they're internally managed and are looking to replicate or increase performance from when they were private. Diverse, yet lots of their retail holdings are Taco Bell leases... which hardly ever go out of business.\r\n\r\nMPW. A hospital real estate trust. Don't see them going anywhere, though I kept this a small position until I learn more about their financials. Hospital real estate is great, but they seem a little opaque to me.\r\n\r\nPDT. A corporate bond fund that has *increased* its NAV since IPO many years ago. High hopes and a complement to the PTY I already own so it balances out the latter's scary high premium.\r\n\r\nLAND. A Gladstone REIT that focuses on specialty crop farmland. No real international competition for its crops, its California land wasn't impacted by wildfires, keen on water rights, and returned close to 21% this year. A fine hedge if nothing else which I plan to own *forever.* Real estate worth over 800 million and growing.\r\n\r\nORCC. A BDC that posted no non-accruals this year which a large teacher's pension fund invested in. I'm a bit weary of this sector but I am okay with it. I like ARCC, HTGC, and TSLX, and hold these companies, but posting zero non-accruals in a terrible year quite frankly speaks volumes about their underwriting.\r\n\r\nMNR. An old and venerable industrial REIT which is well diversified and perhaps overlooked. Ugly buildings book good returns, my friends.\r\n\r\nPGX. A solid preferred shares fund that just about beat SPHD anyway. Wanted to start this for a little while now.\r\n\r\nAnd UTG. A well run CEF focusing on utilities that PDT does not. Biggest holding is NEE, which had a tech-like run up this year.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it. Of all these investments I am most hopeful for BNL (for its price target though I doubt I would sell) and LAND, which is my first real \"hedge\" investment. And a good hedge it is. Absolutely love owning stock units in a farmland trust that is increasing its holdings in a big way. I can taste the blueberries.

They do publish their top tenants but they have about 2500 properties and I was curious as to why it was hard to find the majority of them. The CEO got back to me this morning on this very question. Thought some here might enjoy his response:\r\n\r\n\"There is a Schedule 3 that we file annually at the back of the 10-K with a list of locations, though it may not be what you're looking for. Our disclosure is really strong at the portfolio level - credit strats, master leases, coverages, credit loss walks, etc. We try to connect the dots for you regarding performance. And this is precisely the kind of data our board wants to see - and also me as CEO. As you get into individual addresses, there is literally no valid conclusion you could ever arrive at with respect to portfolio quality. I would call such disclosure a data dump....but of no informative value. And there is a lot of this kind of thing in REITland. For instance, we provide data on sector and industry exposure and provide square footage data, so you can effectively compute the rent per square foot of our limited service restaurants. Let's say, you'd like to compare that to other net lease peers. You cant! No one else discloses this. Even then, were we to hand our location data, you'd have no clue as to the store coverages...and whether the locations were in master leases or not or whether we have credit enhancements- this is crucial data. You'd have no idea, unless we were to disclose it, how much we spent for a property. And you'd generally have no idea of the underlying tenant credit quality. All you might be able to do is to make a high level determination as to whether you like the real estate. Of course, you may not like the real estate...and may wonder why we bought it. But you might like it better if you knew the price or knew what other real estate we bundled the lease with! Anyway, that's why we stick with contract and portfolio disclosure. Plus, since we do so much through direct origination, were we to provide a list of tenants, our peers would simply start to call on them. That is what happens every time a tenant of ours ends up in our top ten list. For instance, we bought a lot of National Veterinary Associates clinics several years ago at cap rates in the 8 and up range. After they got on our list, the rates fell into the low sevens and today they can trade for rates in the mid sixes. We want to avoid repeats like this where possible!

Even if you are familiar with dividend investing, it can be useful to read up on certain chapters that you are unfamiliar with\r\n* There are basic ideas fundamental to dividend investing\r\n   * Dividend Compounding/Reinvesting, Dividend Yield, Dividend Growth, Payout Ratio\r\n   * Dividend Company Categorization: Dividend Champions, Dividend Contenders, etc. \r\n   * Dividend ETF's: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp)\r\n   * Drip Investing: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp)\r\n\r\n**How to Pick Dividend Stocks?**\r\n\r\n*  Spreadsheet of dividend paying companies along with key metrics \r\n   * [https://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp](https://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp) \r\n      * Since the users are international, this tool does have dividend data for Canada, Europe, Eurozone, and UK\r\n      * The only downside of this tool is that it is updated monthly. Therefore, I would recommend using it to find dividend stocks you are interested in and to put them on your watch-list.\r\n      *  I created a website that collects the same data as dripinvesting but uses an API to update daily. Due to self promotion rule, please feel free to pm for a link.

Depending on your goals and timeline, the metrics you value will vary. With that said, you must acknowledge that dividend investing is a long term investing strategy. Compounding takes years and requires reinvesting dividends. You can use this tool to determine what kind of dividend yield and compounding you would need to reach your goal: [https://www.dividend-calculator.com/monthly.php](https://www.dividend-calculator.com/monthly.php)\r\n\r\n**Tracking Your Dividends**\r\n\r\n* DivTracker (app, free): Tracks your portfolio value, yield on market, yield on cost, yearly income, cost basis, and has several cool features. Contains a calendar with dividend payouts and displays the dividends you are expected to receive in the year. The cooler features are not free, however. \r\n* The Rich (app, free): Similar to DivTracker for the most part and has a nice UI\r\n* There are definitely more tools out there that maybe other users can add. Regardless, tracking your dividends is important to make sure that you are meeting your goals and to keep you motivated\r\n\r\n**Brokerage** \r\n\r\n* I don't really have a preference but below is a list of brokerages that support fractional shared and DRIP as that might be important to some investors\r\n* M1, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, E Trade\r\n\r\n**Options** \r\n\r\n* Selling Puts: [https://www.lynalden.com/selling-put-options/](https://www.lynalden.com/selling-put-options/)\r\n* Covered Calls: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/rookies-corner/writing-covered-calls/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/rookies-corner/writing-covered-calls/)\r\n* The strategy is often referred to as the wheel: [https://optionstradingiq.com/the-wheel-strategy/](https://optionstradingiq.com/the-wheel-strategy/)\r\n* Here is a very comprehensive book to options: [http://terredegaia.free.fr/ppics/Trading/Mcgraw-Hill%20-%20Option%20Pricing%20And%20Volatility%20-%20Advanced%20Strategies%20And%20Trading%20Techniques%20-%20Sheldon%20Natenberg%20-%20(1994).pdf](http://terredegaia.free.fr/ppics/Trading/Mcgraw-Hill%20-%20Option%20Pricing%20And%20Volatility%20-%20Advanced%20Strategies%20And%20Trading%20Techniques%20-%20Sheldon%20Natenberg%20-%20(1994).pdf)\r\n   * It is over 400 pages, so I would advise reading it if you are very interested or you want to read specific subsections relevant to dividend investing \r\n* Options are definitely not necessary to succeed as a dividend investor. If done correctly, it can provide benefits such as lowering your cost basis.  There is obviously risk involved and requires a more hands on approach than simply buying stocks. \r\n\r\n**Tax**\r\n\r\n* This is an important point to consider. Given that the audience is international, it is probably in the best interest for you to do your own research. Understanding how dividends are taxed obviously increases the amount of money you receive from dividends\r\n\r\n**My Personal Tips**\r\n\r\n* Dividend investing is a long term strategy and requires reinvesting dividends for maximum potential \r\n* I see a lot of people focused simply on dividend yield, and I would advise caution against it. The consistency of dividends and a growing dividend is key to amazing returns. Therefore, payout ratio, number of consecutive years of growing dividends payed, and dividend growth rate should be at the top of your list when screening stocks alongside dividend yield. \r\n   * When evaluating a company, don't just think about how much they will pay you today but whether or not they will be able to continuously increase how much they pay you for years to come.\r\n* If you have a strong understanding of dividend investing fundamentals, I would recommend investing in individual stocks rather than ETF's. Your portfolio is essentially your personal ETF without the fees associated. With that said, ETF's can be a great starting point for beginners and it's always a good idea to research the stocks that make up any individual ETF. \r\n* Dividend investing can be a really hands off and stress free investing strategy if done correctly. The reason I am so passionate about dividend investing is because I feel that my money is working for me without much work from me. I put in a lot of time upfront to make initial investments but now I primarily just reap the benefits of it.

{"name": "t3_jpyht6", "title": "ETF Diversification Arguments - Why Weighting Matters More Than Holdings - QQQ", "text": " \r\n\r\n# Introduction:\r\n\r\nThis will be a short post regarding the weighting of individual securities in an ETF and taking the implications of that into consideration. ETFs can often be associated with security due to their large number of holdings, it is seen as an indicator for reduced risk, but something that needs to be considered more is this - are all your holdings being weighed equally, why/why not?\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for dividend ETF investors. You need to be aware of the individual holdings in an ETF you invest into because not all companies are made equal. Some are really great, and some are terrible. For Dividend Growth investing looking for the stable, and valuable companies is especially important.\r\n\r\n# Weighting Matters and How It Will Increase/Decrease Your Risk Exposure:\r\n\r\nAn important consideration is that the \"diverse\" ETFs or funds may not be as diversified as you think when the weightings of individual securities are taken into account. Let's take a very popular ETF as an example: QQQ.\r\n\r\nQQQ is very popular market-cap-weighted (larger companies are given more weight more than smaller ones) tracking the NASDAQ 100 index. Because of this weighting system, the top 8 of the stocks in QQQ have a much more significant impact to the growth or decline of the ETF than the other 92! Technology stocks alone make up over 50% of QQQ, so how diversified are you really when over 50% of your potential portfolio is dependent on how well the largest 8 tech companies are doing?\r\n\r\nThe way to minimize your risk to one particular sector or from ETFs that are overweight on several stocks would be to simply search for equal-weight funds (funds that give equal weighting to large/smaller companies), or funds that are simply more broadly diversified than the NASDAQ-100. However be aware there are also plenty of arguments against these funds. For example, you limit your upsides potential, or you give more weight to potential bad apples since all companies are not created equal.\r\n\r\nRegardless the point here is, if you are looking for diversification/security, then, the most important thing is exposure to different sectors so that your portfolio isn't subject to the exact same risks. (Tech / Oil / Subway) Not all market sectors move in tandem, the tech sector has done incredibly well over the past year, however, it is dangerous to take that and project it forward into the future. It was this exact thinking that led to the 2000 tech bubble.\r\n\r\n# Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\n**This is not an argument against owning QQQ (or any similar ETFs), it simply a post regarding to how the weighting of stocks in a fund can affect performance and sector exposure.** Take your risk tolerance into account, are you fine with a large percentage of your portfolio being dedicated to tech, or some other sector? If yeah then have at it, but always do you research. If not, then more broadly diversified funds like SPY or VTI will be more your friend. For dividend investing the goals of NOBL vs SCHD, as well as their individual holdings/market weightings, are very important to consider. \r\n\r\nThere are many sites that break down the goals of ETFs and their individual holdings + weightings of those holdings. Research your funds to ensure they line up with your diversification or consolidation goals.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading guys, if anyone has good researching recommendations or favorite ETFs to recommend then please comment. And have a good day! (or don't if you don't want to, I'm not your mom, I can't tell you what to do)", "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "created_utc": 1604783687.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_js2apj", "title": "Dividend Growth Investing - An Updated In-Depth Guide + Breakdown (November 2020)", "text": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nHello everyone! This will be an updated post and in-depth breakdown for the Dividend Growth strategy. It is important to understand how companies need to be evaluated differently based on the investment philosophy you are pursuing. Now, investing in a dividend growth strategy takes time and patience, depending on your income goal, it can take awhile before a dividend portfolio can fully support enough cash flow to sustain your lifestyle without you needing to rely on a full-time or part-time job. But that is the exciting part, once you have enough income from the dividends you can retire or work a job that you perhaps find more exciting?\r\n\r\n# The Strategy:\r\n\r\nThe dividend growth strategy is focused on building up a portfolio of high quality companies that not only pay out a dividend, but have regularly been increasing the dividend payout. The end goal is to create passive income to live off the increasing dividend payouts. So the focus is placed more on the cash flow for wealth rather than the stock appreciation (appreciation is just an added bonus).\r\n\r\nNOTE: **Dividend yield is not main focus.** A common misconception is that a very high dividend yield is the most important measure, however, a yield that is considerably higher similar stocks in the same industry may indicate not a good dividend but rather a depressed price due to company issues. This price may signal an eventual dividend cut or elimination if the situation continues. Most dividend ETFs will filter out the top percentage of dividends yields for this reason.\r\n\r\nThe strategy here is on the **dividend growth**. If a company increases their payout overtime it is going to have an insane snowball effect when the dividends are reinvested (kinda like the snowball effect for paying off debt). Dividend growth investing uses the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends into the same investment to increase your future dividend payments. With each reinvestment, your shares grow slightly larger. With slightly more shares, your next dividend payment is slightly larger. With enough time invested in solid companies, the growth effect is amazing. This is why dividend growers are so important, they add more fuel to this compounding effect!\r\n\r\nIf you really want to see this effect visualized, check out the charts for Warren Buffets wealth. In 2018 alone, Berkshire raked in **$3.8 billion** in dividends – “a sum that will increase in 2019,” Buffett said in the annual letter. The great majority of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are dividend stocks. And many of those stock are growing their dividend.\r\n\r\n# Evaluating Companies for this Strategy:\r\n\r\nSince the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:\r\n\r\n* Dividend payout ratio:\r\n   * Dividend payouts less than 50%-75% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable.\r\n   * Does the company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term?\r\n* Dividend Yield:\r\n   * Ensure the company is paying a dividend and that the dividend yield isn't too low to start.\r\n   * Watch out for dividend traps! Extremely high dividend yield for non-REITs can often signal an unsustainable payout! Look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (Do research after this ofcourse, this doesn't immediately mean it is healthy)\r\n* Dividend Growth Rate\r\n   * Look for companies that increase their dividend payout year after year.\r\n* Free Cash Flow to Equity:\r\n   * This is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. If a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.\r\n* Debt to EBITDA ratio (Earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)\r\n   * A company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. See AT&T vs Verizon!\r\n\r\nNOTE: The companies are often broken into these categories based on how long they have increased their dividend:\r\n\r\n* Challenger: 5+ years\r\n* Contender: 10-24 years\r\n* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years\r\n* King: 50+ years\r\n\r\nThere are ofcourse many other factors. Consider the business, does it have a sustainable model (Coca-Cola & Pepsi)? Is its market shrinking (See oil companies)? Do you like the company and management?? For this type of investing (any type really), you need to know what you are investing into!\r\n\r\n# Where to Start and Key Things:\r\n\r\nMany of the companies that should be looked for are ones we all recognize because they are so well established and have very wide market exposure. They have incredible staying power for these reasons, and very often have enough money to expand into new markets to remain relevant. This is their significant advantage over startups (many of which they just buy up anyways)\r\n\r\nLet's take PEPSI for example. Pepsico (NYSE: PEP) is a company in the Consumer Defensive Sector, its wide variety of iconic brands and products give it a very large global moat.\r\n\r\n* Current Dividend Ratio:  2.89% (November 2020 based on share price of $141.75)\r\n* Current Annual Dividend Payout:  $4.09\r\n* Average 3 Year Dividend Growth Rate -  **8.60%**\r\n\r\nLooking at this we can see that PEPSI is not only paying a very nice dividend, but it is increasing it at an average of 8%! So even if you don't buy more shares of the stock it will start to pay you more each year just for holding it. The next step from here would be to look into the financials. Essenitally we are just checking to ensure they are not burdened with too much debt, have sharply decreasing revenue, or payouts that exceed their current cashflow.\r\n\r\nOther companies that would be good examples (just a few)\r\n\r\n* AAPL - Apple - Challenger - IT\r\n* MSFT - Microsoft - Contender - IT\r\n* JPM - JPMorgan Chase - Challenger - Financial\r\n* VZ - Verizon - Contender - Telecommunications\r\n* JNJ - Johnson and Johnson - King - Healthcare\r\n* MMM - 3M - King - Industrials\r\n* IBM - International Business Machines - Aristocrat - IT\r\n* KO - Coca-Cola - King - Consumer Defensive\r\n\r\nETFs are an excellent option, however due the large difference in strategies amoung them they will have to be discussed in a separate post. However some notable ones include: NOBL, SCHD, VYM, VIG, DGRO, and DRGW. (Amoung many many others)\r\n\r\n# Advantages and Disadvantages of this Strategy:\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n\r\n* Dividends are not always guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends due to financial pressure. At any moment, companies can decrease their dividend payout or completely get rid of it. **However, many of the companies on the Dividends list maintained and increased their dividends during this time, this highlights the importance of investing in quality companies.**\r\n* Unless you are holding these stocks in an IRA you will pay taxes on them.\r\n* When compared to index investing it decreases diversification since you're really only invested into more “large cap” stocks. You'll be missing out on the mid-cap and small-cap stocks\r\n* Some say dividend payouts of the sign of a dying company. For some perhaps this is true, however a strong counter argument is this. If a company is well established and the payout for moving into a new market sector, or a new acquisition wouldn't be favorable, a company can instead payout dividends to entice investors rather than potentially sacrifice company value just in the name of potential growth.\r\n* You have to pay more attention to the companies you are investing into to ensure they remain healthy and can continue to grow and increase their dividend.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n\r\n* **Reinvesting dividends during sideways moving markets, bear markets, and corrections, purchase more shares with the dividend while the prices are lower. Later, when prices recover, the return is actually enhanced by the temporary fall in the stock price. Reinvesting dividends and accumulating more shares during corrections and bear markets greatly boosts dividend growth investing returns in the long run. This is a significant advantage of dividend stocks over growth stocks in less than ideal market conditions.**\r\n* Historically dividends have provided 43% of the S&P 500 total return from 1930 - 2017 (according to Blackrock). Dividends provide an ongoing return while waiting for capital appreciation.\r\n* The snowball effect of dividend growth compounding can provide competitive returns regardless of whether the price of the stock increases in value or not.\r\n* Creating passive income and preserving capital. Like all stocks they are an excellent hedge against inflation.\r\n\r\n# Performance & Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nIt depends on what timeframe you are looking at, if say we take from December 1999 - 2017 the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.37% per year. But if we take other timeframes then the S&P500 is dominant. Beating the S&P500 over the long term is near impossible, but **beating the S&P isn't the goal of this strategy**. This strategy is focused on passive income generation. Imagine if checks were rolling in every week during the COVID lockdowns even if you weren't working?\r\n\r\nPlease supplement this post with your own research. Compare this strategy to general index investing and growth investing. Find what is right for you.\r\n\r\nThe hope is this post provided insight into this strategy and evaluating dividend paying companies.\r\n\r\nThankyou for taking the time to read!\r\n\r\nThere are many other sources to learn more about dividend focused strategies, in the brand new **Moderator's Collection** for the sub there is a post titled \" **My Complete Guide to Dividend Investing\"** written by  [u/Interriuso](https://www.reddit.com/user/Interriuso/), it holds an incredible amount of useful links and information.

It is called the \"Moderator's Collection.\"\r\n\r\n**What is the moderator's collection?**\r\n\r\nAll moderators on r/dividends have the ability to modify post flair (now).  Basicially the way this works is quite simple.  I have utilized reddit's Collection feature to create a collection.   If a moderator sees a post that they really like, they add it to the collection.\r\n\r\n**What types of posts are added?**\r\n\r\nI leave that entirely up to moderator discretion.  However, I will tell this community the kinds of posts I intend to add (this will likely give you an idea of what other mods will add.\r\n\r\nI personally intend to add posts where I personally feel upvoting is not enough, where commenting is not enough.  If I would give the post a community award, I will likely add it to the collection.  My thought process is that if I were a new user, what would be the best post for me to see to convince me that r/dividends is a truly great community.  Those are the kinds of posts I will be adding.  I am not a mind reader, but I expect other mods to follow similar guidelines.  **I will not exercise any form of control over which posts my fellow moderators choose to include in the collection.**\r\n\r\nThe other mods are free to tell you what they are looking for.  **They are free to not tell you what they are looking for.  They are under no obligation to tell you anything about how they judge posts**.  Though I will tell you this.  One of the fastest ways to get blocked from posting on r/dividends is to ask a mod to add your post to this collection.  Automoderator will be programmed to block any post that requests entry into the moderator's collection.  Direct messaging a mod trying to lobby for your post will get you banned.  I will have no lobbying on this subreddit.\r\n\r\n**Where can I find this collection?**\r\n\r\nGreat question.  I have given you an absolute boatload of places to find the collection.  Here they are:\r\n\r\n1. On the subreddit sidebar, directly underneath the description in the box area labeled \"New to Dividends? Start here.\"\r\n2. At the top of the subreddit in the menu tabs area, next to the button titled \"Contact the Moderators\"\r\n3. This direct hyperlink [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/collection/db6ca5d5-a950-431f-a7d8-eb4df8e573a1).\r\n4. For those of you who browse reddit from a device or third party app that does not support collections.  Do not worry.  I was already thinking of you.  Hence why a flair exists.  This flair is locked to only mod access, so users are incapable of applying it themselves.  You are able to go on the sidebar and find the Moderator's collection in the list of browsable flairs.\r\n\r\nWe here at r/dividends care about the user experience very much, so if I need to come up with some other way you can access the collection, let me know.\r\n\r\n**How do mods add posts?**\r\n\r\nReally simple.\r\n\r\nStep 1: They modify the post flair to be \"Moderator's Collection\"\r\n\r\nStep 2: They hit the button they have access to allowing them to add the post to the collection.\r\n\r\nStep 3: They create a comment notifying the OP and the community that they personally selected this post  to be part of the collection.  The moderator may choose whether or not to explain why they picked the post.  It is entirely at their discretion.  Don't ask them about it if they do not tell you.  Though they do not have to comment if they do not want to.\r\n\r\nStep 4: They distinguish the comment as Moderator and Sticky it in place of the Automod default message.\r\n\r\n**When did you tell the mods about this?**\r\n\r\nI actually did not tell any of the moderators about this in advance because I thought of this 15 minutes ago and I do not like waiting around for things.  My bad guys ( u/finance_student, u/Rasputin_, u/SouthernCriticism, u/hapos, and u/FPS_Yusuf1999).\r\n\r\n**Anything else I need to know?**\r\n\r\nYou should follow the collection if you want to see when posts are added to it.  If you like a post and want it in the collection, the best thing you can do for it is to upvote it, comment on it, and to give it an award.  We mods are humans, and we can be persuaded indirectly.", "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "created_utc": 1605067228.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_jspay5", "title": "Dividend ETFs - NOBL - A Quick Guide/Review", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nHello, as time allows I'll be posts for some of the popular Dividend ETFs on this sub. Tonight will be starting with...\r\n\r\n# NOBL -  ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF:\r\n\r\nThe strategy of this fund is to track an equal-weighted index of S&P 500 companies that have increased dividend payments annually for at least 25 years. Since it is equal-weighting, the individual holdings will compromise usually no more than 1.8%-2.5% of the total portfolio after each quarterly rebalance. (Fluctuates with the number of holdings) Holdings must also meet a $3 Billion market cap and liquidity requirements to be considered. \r\n\r\n* Tracks: S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index\r\n* Yield: 1.28% (11 November 2020)\r\n* Expense Ratio: 0.35%\r\n* Payout: Quarterly\r\n* Total Number of Holdings: 65 (Higher than most similar ETFs)\r\n\r\n# Dividend History: \r\n\r\nThere has been an overall upward trend with the dividend payout overall, however, there have been several notable downticks over several quarters in the past few years. This will be shown in the table below. (Just 2 years...)  \r\n\r\n\r\n|Dividend Date|Dividend Payout|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|20 March 2019|$0.24|\r\n|25 June 2019|$0.38|\r\n|25 September 2019|$0.36|\r\n|24 December 2019|$0.44|\r\n|25 March 2020|$0.34|\r\n|24 June 2020|$0.41|\r\n\r\n# Sector Weightings (November 2020):\r\n\r\n*  Industrials - 24.34%\r\n* Consumer Staples - 19.69%\r\n* Materials - 12.63%\r\n* Financials - 10.75%\r\n* Health Care - 9.41%\r\n* Consumer Discretionary - 8.60%\r\n* Real Estate - 5.08%\r\n* Energy - 3.26%\r\n* Utilities - 3.00%\r\n* Information Technology - 1.70%\r\n* Communication Services - 1.53% \r\n\r\nHere we can see the fund is particularly weighted in Industrials and Consumer Staples while having very low weight in Information Technology and Communication Services. This is understandable since Tech companies are much newer and have not had the opportunity to grow their dividends for 25+ years. We could eventually see them added to the fund in the future. As for Financials and Communications Services, well 2008 saw a lot of these companies slashing dividends, so they were eliminated from the fund as a result. \r\n\r\n# Advantages, Disadvantages & 5-yr Performance:\r\n\r\nAdvantages: \r\n\r\n* Quality Holdings - Composed only of companies with 25+ years of dividend growth\r\n* More holdings than many similar ETFs\r\n* More exposure to mid-cap companies\r\n* Lower Volatility\r\n* Has historical periods of outperforming the S&P500 (If we include the 2000 dotcom bubble so kinda cheating)\r\n\r\nDisadvantages: \r\n\r\n* Sector weightings can causes cyclical periods of underperformance due to Industrials exposure\r\n* Due to the filtering strategy is has many older companies in its holdings\r\n* Expense Ratio of 0.35% is high for a passive index ETF\r\n\r\nPerformance: (As of November, this is very likely to change)\r\n\r\n|1 Year|3 Year|5 Year|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|6.42%|10.31%|11.43%|\r\n\r\n# Takeaways and Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nOverall it is a quality ETF with a decent track record, an overall increasing dividend, and safer holdings. It is has some significant disparities in its sector weightings, but those can always be filled with other ETFs or quality individual stocks until they are eventually added to the fund. \r\n\r\nFor dividend growth investors the yield on this ETF is a bit low and there is a lot of fluctuation in the payout amounts. Please note that if you are considering this ETF.\r\n\r\nThis was just a quick review, so please supplement this with your own research. The individual holdings were not discussed simply because there were too many of them for this post. Thankyou for taking the time to read, hopefully some found this helpful.

{"name": "t3_ju6nki", "title": "Dividend ETFs - DGRW - A Quick Guide/Review", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nHello everyone, today I'll quickly be covering a popular monthly paying ETF - DGRW\r\n\r\n# DGRW -  WisdomTree US Quality Dividend Growth Fund:\r\n\r\nThe strategy of this ETF is unique, it focuses on potential for dividend growth as opposed to backward-looking dividend increases, investing in large/midcap dividend-paying stocks with stronger growth characteristics.  It's methodology is to compare the forward-looking earnings estimates with historical Return on Assets and Return on Equity growth in its selection process. Additionally this ETF does contain REITs, holding companies, and some ADRs.\r\n\r\nThe fund aims to limit the weighting of its holdings to 5%, however it is only rebalanced once a year in December, so there can be some fluctuations. The index is also weighted by dividends and not market capitalization. \r\n\r\n*  TracksWisdomTree US Dividend Growth Index \r\n* Yield: 2.17% (14 November 2020)\r\n* Expense Ratio: 0.28%\r\n* Payout: Monthly\r\n* Total Number of Holdings: 266\r\n\r\n# Dividend History:\r\n\r\nThere has been an overall yearly upward trend with the dividend payout, however, the payouts are inconsistent month to month. Below is the payout for 2020 alone (Based on a payout of $1.04 per share)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n|Month|Amount|Yield|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|Jan|$0.04|0.97%|\r\n|Feb|\\-|\\-|\r\n|Mar|$0.10|3.3%|\r\n|Apr|$0.09|2.65%|\r\n|May|$0.07|1.92%|\r\n|June|$0.12|3.18%|\r\n|July|$0.0550|1.4%|\r\n|Aug|$0.07|1.67%|\r\n|Sept|$0.07|1.72%|\r\n\r\n# Sector Weightings (November 2020):\r\n\r\n* Industrials - 19.23%\r\n* Consumer Staples - 14.49%\r\n* Materials - 2.79%\r\n* Financials - 5.29%\r\n* Health Care - 15.42%\r\n* Consumer Discretionary - 9.40%\r\n* Energy - 0.93%\r\n* Utilities - 1.66%\r\n* Information Technology - 25.48%\r\n* Communication Services - 5.32%\r\n\r\n# Top Holdings:\r\n\r\n* Apple - 6.86%\r\n* Microsoft - 5.51%\r\n* Verizon - 5.23%\r\n* Procter & Gamble - $.37%\r\n* PepsiCo - 2.88%\r\n* Merck & Co - 2.88%\r\n* Altaria - 2.56%\r\n* Comcast - 2.18% (*Gross*)\r\n\r\nFor this one the top holdings were included to show why this fund has more weighting in Technology than NOBL did. The heavier weightings can produce more risk/reward to the portfolio due to the recent boom from Tech, and the cyclical nature of industrials. There is a signficant underweighting in energy, however this can be seen as both a positive and negative. The energy companies tend to have high yields, however COVID has put many of them in a difficult position. Looking at you XOM. \r\n\r\n# Advantages, Disadvantages & 5-yr Performance:\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n\r\n* Quality Holdings\r\n* Focused on stocks with good earnings and competitive advantages\r\n* Very Well Diversified with 266 holdings \r\n* More exposure to Tech\r\n* Monthly Payouts\r\n* Strong performance even when compared to S&P500 ETF - VOO (with higher yeild)\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n\r\n* More growth stocks than most dividend ETFs (this could be an advantage as well)\r\n* Acceptable Expense Ratio, still slightly high.\r\n* Yield is low compared to single stocks\r\n   * This is just the disadvantage of ETFs to single stocks really. \r\n\r\nPerformance: (As of November 2020, this is very likely to change)\r\n\r\n|1 Year|3 Year|5 Year|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|17.88%|13.04%|12.26%|\r\n\r\n# Takeaways and Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nOverall this is a high quality monthly paying ETF with very strong performance and solid holdings. The yield is still low compared to single stocks and is lower compared to some similar ETFs due to holding more growth oriented stocks, however it performs very well due to its tendency to have value oriented holdings in its portfolio. \r\n\r\nFor dividend growth investors the yield on this ETF is a bit low and there is only 1 year of consecutive dividend growth. If Dividend Growth is your goal, then look for another ETF or cherry pick some of the good companies from the portfolio. \r\n\r\nThis was just a quick review, so please supplement this with your own research. Thankyou for taking the time to read, hopefully some found this helpful. Have a good day everyone.", "score": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "created_utc": 1605378603.0, "tickers": []}

Barry Sternlicht, the CEO, thinks the company is incredibly undervalued at current prices. I have to agree, as he gave his reasoning behind his valuation of the company which seems to be spot on. I've been holding this baby since $11 but am considering buying more if it pulls back, would love to hear everyone's thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"So if you believe our $3 of fair value that's not in the undepreciated book value, bringing our fair value above $20 a share, let's take the $15.86, let's take the $3 out of it, that's $12.06. That's the $3 of equity assets that are largely either fully leased industrial buildings or affordable housing assets that are in some of the best markets in the country and stay completely full because rents are 30% below fair value of garden apartments of market-rate apartments. And then take out the accumulated depreciation of $1.30, you're buying our stock at $10.76 against the GAAP book value of $15.86 That's 66% of the GAAP value of our company.\r\n\r\nOur average loan is 61% LTV. So you're buying these assets in the loans at $0.41 at par of the fair value of the asset. And for that, you're getting a 13% dividend yield. Seems a little ridiculous.\r\n\r\nSo there's no way property values and what we have linked against are down 60%. So I don't think anyone's even considered that as a possibility. So our issue has always been the same issue.

{"name": "t3_jur1nc", "title": "Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) vs PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) - A Quick Comparison - Which is better?", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nGood Morning/Evening everyone. Today will be a comparison between Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Lets first look at the company moats, starting with Pepsi...\r\n\r\n# PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP):\r\n\r\nDividend Aristocrat: 48 Years of Consecutive Dividend Growth\r\n\r\nPepsi isn't only the #2 beverage company (Just behind KO), but it is the #1 in snacks. It's business is concentrated on convienience items and is divided into the following 6 segments:\r\n\r\nPepsiCo (PEP) is the global leader in the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of food (52%) and beverages (48%). The company is # 2 only to Coca-Cola in beverages, and # 1 in snacks. Profits are derived approximately 58% from the United States and 42% international. (Revenue based on October 2020 reports)\r\n\r\n* PepsiCo America Beverages (34% of Revenues)\r\n* Frito-Lay North America (25%)\r\n* PepsiCo Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (16%)\r\n* Latin America Foods (11%)\r\n* PepsiCo AMEA (Asia, Middle East, North Africa) 10%\r\n* Quaker Foods North America (4%)\r\n\r\nThe following are noteworthy brands that are owned by PepsiCo:\r\n\r\n>Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7 Up, Miranda, Sierra Mist, Gatorade, Tropicana, Lipton, Aquafina, Brisk, Starbucks RTD Beverages, Lay’s, Doritos, Quaker, Cheetos, Ruffles, Tostitos, Fritos, and Walkers.\r\n\r\nTheir expose to food/snacks provides a significant advantage to Pepsi, greatly increasing its yearly revenue, and providing the company significant staying power. (Especially during market downturns). The biggest weakness to their model is the move towards healthier food and drink options, Pepsi is very aware of this and is aggressively moving into this market, currently,  Approximately 25% of PepsiCo revenues come from everyday nutrition products. \r\n\r\nSo let's compare their business to Coca-Cola.\r\n\r\n# Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)\r\n\r\nDividend King: 58 Years of Consecutive Dividend Growth\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola is the largest nonalcoholic beverage company in the world. Unlike PepsiCo, Coca-Cola remains exclusively in the beverage business. Some of its brands include:\r\n\r\n>Coca-Cola, Fanta, Schweppes, Sprite, Dasani, Smartwater, Powerade, VitaminWater, Minute Maid, Innocent, Simply, Fairlife, Georgia Coffee, Costa Coffee **(A recent UK Acquisition),** Fuze Tea, Honest, Gold Peak, Peace Tea\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola's concentration in the beverage industry is what allows them to dominate. They have very high brand loyalty, direct manufacturing and distribution systems, and established relationships with retailers worldwide which provide significant barriers to entry for any potential new competitors. Recently Coke has made some smart acquisitions, such as Costa Coffee in the UK (about 1/3 of all coffee sales), and has been eliminating less popular products to increase revenue and focus on what is working.\r\n\r\nIts advantage is also its greatest weakness, Coca-Colas company model relies solely on the beverage industry which makes it much more susceptible to market fluctuations, and environmental issue, such as reliance on potable pure water. Additionally Coke has done less than Pepsi to move into healthier industries. It is very likely on their radar. \r\n\r\n# Quick Look at Numbers:\r\n\r\nNOTE: Numbers are currently for November 2020 and are likely to change.\r\n\r\n|\\-|PEPSICO|COCA-COLA|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.09|$1.64|\r\n|Yield|2.83%|3.07%|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|8%|6.9%|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|9%|4.6%|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|8.7%|2.6%|\r\n|Current Payout Ratio|\\~73%|\\~77%|\r\n|Free Cash Flow / Share|$4.56|$1.50|\r\n|Revenue|$18.09 Billion|$8.65 Billion|\r\n|Debt / Equity Ratio|3.31 (Not very Healthy)|2.84 (Healthier but still eh)|\r\n\r\nBased on the basic numbers and the previously mentioned business model Pepsi has a bit more stability when compared to Coca-Cola due to having a wider market and increased revenue. However we can also see that PepsiCo currently leverages more debt, however most of it is long term debt that is very unlikely to adversely affect the company, especially since consumer defensive companies are profitable even in market downturns. \r\n\r\nBased on the dividend growth, Pepsi is the clear winner. It has had a higher 10 year return, and its recent history shows that it isn't slowing down. The payouts are very similar, and if Coca-Cola does not increase its dividend growth rate then Pepsi will overtake its yield in the near future. The payout ratios are a bit high right now, below 75% is a better ratio, however this can be given a pass since 2020 has been a wild ride, if those ratios continue to increase over the next years then that will call their dividend safety into question.\r\n\r\n# Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nThe future for the companies will be interesting. Undoubtedly we will see more advancement into healthier beverage/food options, but the bigger question is what will Coca-Cola's future moves be after eliminating its less popular brands? How will environmental factors affect their businesses. \r\n\r\nWhich is your favorite between the two? Or both? Both is good?\r\n\r\nPlease supplement this with your own research, we only glanced at the numbers, so take the time to read more into their books or business models. \r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!", "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "created_utc": 1605466220.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_jufu4f", "title": "Why I do not use banks, why I never will, and why you should not either.", "text": "\\[This post is dedicated to the people who keep messaging me every day asking for financial advice.\\]\r\n\r\nGood afternoon r/dividends,\r\n\r\nFor those not familiar with United States financial laws, the title of this post may be rather jarring to you. After all, the lead moderator of r/dividends not using a bank.  It sounds crazy.  But allow me to explain.  I keep 100% of my liquid financial assets (cash) at a Credit Union.  \r\n\r\nSome of you may be confused.  Some of you may think this post was clickbait.  I can assure you it is not.  Here in the United States, Credit Unions are **extremely** distinct from banks.  Here are some exerpts per Wikipedia's [article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union).\r\n\r\n> Credit unions differ from [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank) and other financial institutions in that those who have accounts in the credit union are its members and owners, and they elect their board of directors in a [one-person-one-vote system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_man_one_vote) regardless of their amount invested.   \r\n>  \r\n>Credit unions offer many of the same financial services as banks but often use different terminology. Typical services include share accounts ([savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account)), share draft accounts ([checking accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_account)), [credit cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card), share term certificates ([certificates of deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit)), and [online banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_banking). Normally, only a member of a credit union may [deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account) or [borrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan) [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money). Surveys of customers at banks and credit unions have consistently shown significantly higher customer satisfaction rates with the quality of service at credit unions.  \r\n>  \r\n>Credit unions have historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation. In the context of [financial inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_inclusion), credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most [microfinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance) institutions.  \r\n>  \r\n>In the credit union context, \"[not-for-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not-for-profit)\" must be distinguished from a charity. Credit unions are \"not-for-profit\" because their purpose is to serve their members rather than to maximize profits, so unlike charities, credit unions do not rely on donations and are financial institutions that must make what is, in economic terms, a small [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(economics)) (i.e., in non-profit accounting terms, a \"surplus\") to remain in existence. According to the [World Council of Credit Unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Council_of_Credit_Unions) (WOCCU), a credit union's [revenues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue) (from loans and investments) must exceed its operating expenses and [dividends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend) (interest paid on deposits) in order to maintain capital and solvency.  \r\n>  \r\n>In the United States, credit unions incorporated and operating under a state credit union law are tax-exempt under [Section 501(c)(14)(A)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)). Federal credit unions organized and operated in accordance with the [Federal Credit Union Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Credit_Union_Act) are tax-exempt under [Section 501(c)(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)).  \r\n>  \r\n>Credit unions often form cooperatives among themselves to provide services to members. A [credit union service organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union_service_organization) (CUSO) is generally a for-profit subsidiary of one or more credit unions formed for this purpose. For example, [CO-OP Financial Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO-OP_Financial_Services), the largest credit-union-owned [interbank network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbank_network) in the United States, provides an ATM network and shared branching services to credit unions. Other examples of cooperatives among credit unions include credit counseling services as well as insurance and investment services.   \r\n>  \r\n>In the United States, federal credit unions are chartered by and overseen by the [National Credit Union Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Credit_Union_Administration) (NCUA), which also provides deposit insurance similar to the manner in which the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation) (FDIC) provides deposit insurance to banks. State-chartered credit unions are overseen by the state's financial regulatory agency and may, but are not required to, obtain deposit insurance. Because of problems with bank failures in the past, no state provides deposit insurance and as such there are two primary sources for depository insurance – the NCUA and [American Share Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Share_Insurance) (ASI), a private insurer based in Ohio. \r\n\r\nHere in the United States, 41% of Americans old enough to have a control over a financial account already utilizes a credit union as their primary financial services provider.  These are **not** banks.  They by legal definition cannot be banks.  A bank is by its very nature a for-profit entity.  A credit union can never be for-profit.  \r\n\r\nTo all the people messaging me daily asking for financial advice, asking me where to put your money, I would recommend a credit union.  I have never seen a bank even come close to matching the interest rate of my local credit union.  I recommend pulling out google and searching around your area.  A lot of credit unions are geography based.  So long as you live within a certain distance of a branch of the credit union (ie the same county) you are eligible to become a member (though many do have other requirements, such as a particular employer, income level, etc.).  \r\n\r\nI personally see the greatest asset of credit unions coming in the form of all the services they provide.  Things like free financial and investment advice (excellent for new investors), as well as easy to understand savings options to help build your wealth.  Things like Money Market Accounts, IRAs, and even savings accounts.  Credit Unions do them better and they give you more money, because they do not have to make a profit.  Just enough to keep the lights on.\r\n\r\nI would at least consider it when choosing which company you will keep your money in for the rest of your life.  I have been a credit union member since the day I was born, and my future children will be the same way.\r\n\r\nIf you are not from the US, please check your local listings (and maybe pick up a user flair for your particular country.

{"name": "t3_juxsj3", "title": "3M (NYSE: MMM) - A Quick Guide/Review - A Dividend King", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\n3M, previously known as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, might not be the most iconic corporation, however it is one of the largest in the US, in fact, they are one of the few companies actually still in the DOW Jones. 3M has been an incredibly innovative company since its humble beginnings, it currently holds over 118,000 patents. They are involved extensively in industry, worker safety, US health care, and consumer goods, producing over 60,000 different products, and operating in over 70 countries.\r\n\r\nRight now, 3M is organized into these four business segments:\r\n\r\n* Safety and Industrial\r\n* Transportation and Electronics\r\n* Health Care\r\n* Consumer Discretionary\r\n\r\n# Company Strengths & Risks:\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n\r\n3M is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of increasing their dividend.\r\n\r\n3M has strong branding, strong control over a large number of patents and technology, and is a low-cost producer of good. The company is well diversified amoung its 4 segments, this shields them against cyclic revenue streams. Additionally,  3M is expanding rapidly into new emerging markets, and has been good at making small acquisitions that propel growth/product acquisition.\r\n\r\nRisks:\r\n\r\nThe companies number of patents is also a disadvantage, it causes the company to have to allocate more money towards litigations. In addition to this, the low-cost good produced by other companies require 3M to be more careful with its pricing. Lastly, the products they produce have a life-cycle, so more money needs to be allocated to R&D to produce relevant and quality products. (Not that they have had an issue with this)\r\n\r\n# Let's Look at the Numbers:\r\n\r\nNOTE: Numbers are currently for November 2020 and are likely to change.\r\n\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$5.88|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|Yield|3.46%|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|10.9%|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|9.1%|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|\r\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|66.67%|\r\n|Free Cash Flow / Share|$10.86|\r\n|Revenue|$8.35 Billion|\r\n|Debt / Equity Ratio|1.91 (Healthy)|\r\n\r\n3M has some healthy looking financials despite COVID. This has a lot to do with their diversification, while they have lost money in Industrials and Consumer products, they have buffered this with their exposure to Health Care, in fact the company is producing many of the N95 masks being used now.\r\n\r\n3M has very strong prospects for dividend growth. Their EPS payout of 66% indicates they still have quite enough wiggle room to continue increasing the dividend, and the 3, 5, and 10 year increases have been superb. They can be given a pass for their 1 year increase due to COVID.\r\n\r\nIf fact, lets take their 3-year average and project that forward to guesstimate what their future payouts could be. (These are estimates! The actual payouts could be wildly different.)\r\n\r\n|Year|Potential Payout (Based on 9%)|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|2021|$6.40|\r\n|2022|$6.61|\r\n|2023|$6.84|\r\n|2024|$7.03|\r\n\r\n# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\n3M is an excellent dividend growth stock. The company has a wide moat, strong revenue, is smart with its acquisitions, and has healthier levels of debt compared to many similar companies. The company would be strongly recommended for any dividend/dividend growth focused portfolio.\r\n\r\nPlease supplement this with your own research, there are more numbers out there, plus the company has an interesting history and it is worth reading up on if you are interested.\r\n\r\nFor me, it is one of my larger positions. Don't take that and run though! Always do your own research and come to your own conclusions about whether or not you like and want to invest into a company.\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!", "score": 123, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "created_utc": 1605489846.0, "tickers": [["DOW", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_jw7lu7", "title": "Unveiling the new community awards", "text": "Good afternoon r/dividends,\r\n\r\nIn my moderation of this community, I have been working to create an environment of positivity and mutual benefit.  In the pursuit of this goal, I have henceforth commissioned the creation of 20 new community awards, the maximum allowable under Reddit's guidelines.  16 shall be bestowed between users of the community.  Four shall be issued solely by the moderation team.\r\n\r\nFor the past two months I have been experimenting with a way to create awards that would be considered meaningful, worthwhile, and legitimate by the community.  To fulfill that goal, I have chosen to take a page from my days editing Wikipedia and co-opt the barnstar system in place over there.\r\n\r\nA brief explainer for the uninitiated, on Wikipedia it is customary to award users for their hard work and due diligence by giving them what are known as \"Barnstars.\" [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars) is a link explaining what barnstars are to Wikipedia and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstar) is the link for those who have no idea what a barnstar even is in real life.  Since their introduction in 2003 on Wikipedia, they have become ingrained in the site's editing culture.  They promote civility and positivity in the community.  By bringing them to r/dividends, I intend to replicate that experience one gets when you receive them on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to define for you the circumstances upon which you the community wish to utilize these awards.  Instead, I will state two things that may pique your interest.\r\n\r\nThe first is the moderator awards.  It is my intention for 100% of coin revenue generated to be put back into members of this community.  There are four moderator issued awards:\r\n\r\n* Award 1 is the Barnstar of Noteworthy Merit.  The cost to the community is 1800 coins.  The plan is for it to be issued automatically by mods to any post deemed worthy of entry into the Moderator's Collection.  Per the autogenerated description:  \"Shows the Barnstar of Noteworthy Merit Award and gives the recipient 1 month of Premium (which includes 700 Coins a month).\"\r\n* Award 2 is the Barnstar of Integrity.  The cost to the community is 5400 coins.  I have told the moderators they may issue it at their discretion.  Per the award description: \"Shows the Barnstar of Integrity Award and gives the recipient 3 months of Premium (which includes 700 Coins a month).\"\r\n* Award 3 is the Barnstar of Excellence Award.  The cost to the community is 10,800 coins.  I have told the moderators they may issue it at their discretion.  Per the award description:  \"Shows the Barnstar of Excellence Award and gives the recipient 6 months of Premium (which includes 700 Coins a month).\"\r\n* Award 4 is the Barnstar of Ultimate Merit Award.  The cost to the community is 21,600 coins.  This award will be given to any post that can dethrone the top post of all time (mod posts are not eligible).  Per the award description: \"Shows the Barnstar of Ultimate Merit Award and gives the recipient 12 months of Premium (which includes 700 Coins a month).\"\r\n\r\nThe second note is that I will remove any moderators that try to give moderator awards to another moderator.  I have been very careful in selecting who I believe to be a great group of people who would never even contemplate such a quid pro quo idea, which is why I am not concerned about this happening in the slightest.  I am just letting you the community know that mods here will not be receiving free premium, unless it comes from you guys gilding our posts.\r\n\r\nI will be here to answer any questions you may have once I get some sleep in.

{"name": "t3_jwvf9b", "title": "My personal opinion on Republic Bancorp ($RBCAA).", "text": "The following is an opinion piece, and should be treated as such. It should not be taken as a substitute for conducting your own research. \r\n\r\nOverview: \r\n\r\nRepublic Bancorp is a regional bank headquartered in Louisville Kentucky.  Not to be confused with the California bank of a similar name.  The market cap is currently under $800 million, and the company employs roughly 1080 people as of their last filings.\r\n\r\n[Link to Seeking Alpha Financial Data](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBCAA/income-statement).\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nMy one sentence opinion: A smaller bank, but one I hold in high regard.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nMy longform opinion: \r\n\r\nOn Thursday, November 19, 2020 I will be directing 100% of my bi-monthly purchasing activity into acquiring shares of Republic Bancorp at market open. This is very unusual for me. Normally, I am insistant upon letting M1's autoinvest handle everything for me. However, the markets seem to be completely ignoring this company.\r\n\r\nThe metrics make absolutely no sense.  If the market was perfect, you would never see all of these metrics together. Ask any professional analyst and they would tell you this is an impossibility.\r\n\r\nYield is over 3% while payout ratio is ~30%.  Payout ratio has been trending down, and has pretty much been cut in half over the last five years.  Meanwhile, the dividend has continued to grow, creating a 21 year dividend growth streak with an average growth rate of 8% annually, beating out many major companies. All the while this stock has a P/E ratio of 10.  Revenue has almost doubled over the last five years. Profits have more than doubled over the last five years. For every dollar this company earns, 31.52 cents is pure profit. And that ratio is increasing. All the while customers still speak very highly of the bank. EPS has tripled over the past five years. It doesn't appear to be engaging in anything illegal.   Book value per share is currently higher than the average share price at the time of writing this piece.\r\n\r\nI could keep going, but you get the idea. For those who just read the income statements and look at the share price, you may see skepticism. But one singular metric reveals why this stock is currently down 20% over the past year, despite being in an objectively better position than it was back then. That metric is the institutional ownership. 29.32% of this company is held by institutions (aka companies). 3.69% is held by insiders (aka the people who run the company).  The rest is held by the general public. Either in index funds, ETFs, or as individual shares. This is why the price is where it is. Companies are the reason we can see massive price action pushing a stock up or down. With an average volume of only 15-20 thousand, clearly this stock is not being day-traded by any major firms. At least not at any serious level. It is mostly retail investors trading with other retail investors. Most of whom are likely simply using buy options to purchase the security at whatever the current price is. Hence why the stock's value is slow to recover from covid.\r\n\r\nAfter the market plunged in February, many institutions feared a 2009 repeat, so they pulled out of regional banks. This caused their stocks to enter free fall. Many Republic Bank insiders appear to have taken advantage of that opportunity. I as a retail investor, will also be taking advantage of this rare opportunity to set the stage for increasing my yield on cost.

This afternoon I found it located here: [https://vectortoons.com/products/a-stockbroker-making-a-trade-call-over-the-phone-and-stock-exchange-trading-floor-background?\\_pos=2&\\_sid=db14e32ea&\\_ss=r](https://vectortoons.com/products/a-stockbroker-making-a-trade-call-over-the-phone-and-stock-exchange-trading-floor-background?_pos=2&_sid=db14e32ea&_ss=r)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThe following should be considered by any legal teams working for vectorcartoons as criticism and review of the image:\r\n\r\nI personally would have been willing to pay $20 for a stock photo image of high quality and finished design, but unfortunately looking at your image I realized it would be unusable in its original form.  To begin with, when uploaded into a photo editing software, the image contains many corrupt pixels.  Either the artist did not notice or did not care.  I am sorry vectorcartoons, but I refuse to pay for an unfinished product.  I spent four hours fixing your inferior product just to get me to a blank template capable of being worked with.  And do not even get me started on the jackass idiot taking up half the image.  Like stand a little closer to the camera please.  2/10.  Would not pay for.\r\n\r\nSo what I did was I decided to air out my frustration and grievance by creating a parody image of your design, vectorcartoons.  To ensure the r/dividends community will be adequately able to see my parody image, I have set it to be the banner image for this subreddit on mobile devices.  Do not worry,  I will remove it once 99.99% of all humanity has witnessed the image.  So within a reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\nTo make this parody image, I took your stock photo and imported it into a program called [paint.net](https://paint.net).  The program is free.  I took to painstakingly removing each of the dozens of watermarks littered throughout the image.  I then cut out the idiot man, mirrored what was left, and resized it to match the dimensions Reddit prefers for mobile banner images (1600x480).  I then went through the r/dividends community and selected the following users, whose Reddit Avatars I inserted into the image.  Below they are listed in alphabetical order:\r\n\r\n* u/036Gooddaysir036\r\n* u/10000000000000000091\r\n* u/AlexRuchti\r\n* u/Amyx231\r\n* u/azthealien\r\n* u/DexHendrixT5HMG\r\n* u/elmexiguero\r\n* u/FPS_Yusuf1999\r\n* u/hapos\r\n* u/Hiro08\r\n* u/humanitysucks999\r\n* u/Interriuso\r\n* u/JDinvestments\r\n* u/La7meLa7me\r\n* u/Overnight-Defendant\r\n* u/PrefersDigg\r\n* u/SeekNDestroy\r\n* u/The-BEAST\r\n* u/thriller13\r\n* u/xxXHIPPOKILLAXxx\r\n\r\nI intend to make another one of these parody images for the desktop since the dimensions are so different from the mobile needs, so if you desire to be in the next one, I suggest you choose a user flair.

{"name": "t3_jxgg6f", "title": "IBM (NYSE: IBM) - An In-depth Stock Analysis", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nGood evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.\r\n\r\nThere will be a few questions we are looking to answer:\r\n\r\n1. Is there revenue growth?\r\n2. Is there earnings growth?\r\n3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)\r\n4. Is there strong cash flow?\r\n\r\n# IBM - International Business Machines:\r\n\r\nInternational Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:\r\n\r\n* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),\r\n* Software (29% of revenue),\r\n* IT services (23% of revenue),\r\n* Hardware (8% of revenues).\r\n\r\nIBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.\r\n\r\n**Strengths:**\r\n\r\n>\\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.\r\n\r\n**Risks:**\r\n\r\n>\\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.\r\n\r\n# Financial History:\r\n\r\nThere is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.\r\n\r\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|\r\n|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|\r\n|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|\r\n|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|\r\n|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|\r\n|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|\r\n|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|\r\n\r\nThe revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.\r\n\r\nSo let's answer some of the questions.\r\n\r\n1. Is there revenue growth?  - No\r\n2. Is there earnings growth? - No\r\n3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt\r\n4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.\r\n\r\nThis is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|\r\n|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|\r\n|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|\r\n\r\nWhat is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \\~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \\~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.\r\n\r\nAt the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \\~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.\r\n\r\nLet's quickly look into where the money is coming from.\r\n\r\n**Revenue:**\r\n\r\n|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\\+6%|\r\n|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\\+2.4%|\r\n|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\\-3.7%|\r\n\r\nLooking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \\~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.\r\n\r\nThis also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.\r\n\r\n# So what's the big if?\r\n\r\nThe big \"IF\" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.\r\n\r\n# Some other numbers:\r\n\r\nNOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.\r\n\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|Yield|5.84%|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|\r\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|\r\n|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|\r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.\r\n\r\n# Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nIBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.\r\n\r\nPicking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)\r\n\r\nUltimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?\r\n\r\nI hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Fixed some math errors. Thanks everyone for the comments, remember this post wasn't an endorsement or recommendation to buy or sell, just something to get brain juices going.

I want to make sure any future write ups are at minimum- held to a high standard. I want to offer DD on one of my speculation plays and may do other speculation play write-ups depending on the interest. Thank you to u/036Gooddaysir036 for allowing their templates to be used.\r\n\r\n# Introduction:\r\n\r\nHasbro is one of the most well known, but never talked about companies. Hasbro is a dividend contender, having grown their dividend for 17 years. They are most well known for their focus in consumer products, gaming, and entertainment. Hasbro is also diversified into retail, digital retail, eCommerce, and omni-channel retail, offering a cushion against Covid-19.\r\n\r\nSome recognizable big names and games under HAS:\r\n\r\nTransformers, Play-Doh, Nerf, Baby Alive, Magic: the Gathering, Monopoly, My Little Pony, Peppa Pig, Pjmasks, Power Rangers, Jenga, Connect 4, Life, Operation, Furreal friends, HASCON, Dungeons and Dragons.\r\n\r\nThere will be a few questions we are looking to answer:\r\n\r\n- Is there revenue growth?\r\n- Is there earnings growth?\r\n- Is the company really leveraged?\r\n- Is there strong cash flow?\r\n\r\n## Company Strengths & Risks:\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n\r\n- 17 consecutive years of increasing their dividend\r\n- Strong branding, Strong and diverse products and partnerships\r\n- Acquirement of eOne (Entertainment One), Allspark pictures, and allspark animation\r\n- Acquirement of Milton Bradley, Playskool and Tonka\r\n- Agreements with Disney for Star Wars, and other similar rights\r\n\r\nRisks:\r\n\r\n- COVID 19 has slowed supply and likely will have an impact on demand until COVID 19 ends. COVID 19 has also shifted live action production to 2021. [Hasbro's response to COVID 19](https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/e3715112-0362-4a2c-a8aa-220171ecff91)\r\n- Agreement with Disney is costly but beneficial to both sides. Listed as a risk due to the drain on cash. \r\n- relatively high payout ratio (75.45).\r\n- Free cash flow fluctuates year to year\r\n\r\n## Financial History and numbers\r\n\r\nNumbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HAS/balance-sheet?p=HAS) as of Nov 2020\r\n\r\n Current Annual Payout/Share | $2.72  \r\n-----------------------------|--------\r\n Yield                       | 2.92%  \r\n 10 Yr Div Growth Rate       | 12.81% \r\n 3 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 10.29% \r\n 1 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 1.87%  \r\n Years Of Growth             | 17     \r\n Current Payout Ratio        | 75.45  \r\n Free Cash Flow / Share      | 2.83   \r\n Revenue                     | 1.78B  \r\n Debt / Equity Ratio         | 1.35   \r\n \r\n(napkin math: 4,046,960/2,995,530=1.35)\r\n\r\nHAS has pretty healthy financials despite COVID and being in the Consumer Cyclical sector. The payout ratio is high but I attribute it to acquisitions and partnerships. Revenue has been reported to be strong too with respect to Magic the Gathering, Monopoly, and Dungeons and Dragons from the Q3 earnings call. Those increases too, are phenomenal. In fact, lets project this forward to guesstimate the future payouts. (These are estimates, the actual payouts can range differently)\r\n\r\n Year | Potential payout (based on 10.29%) \r\n------|------------------------------------\r\n 2021 | 2.82                               \r\n 2022 | 3.03                               \r\n 2023 | 3.33                               \r\n 2024 | 3.76                               \r\n\r\nHasbro's [dividend history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/dividends/history) makes it all the more appealing to me.\r\n\r\n## Takeaway/Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nHAS to me is an excellent speculation play for dividend growth. The company has many recognized household names and shows, and is strengthening its ties with entertainment and toys. The dividend history and growth is phenomenal. I would highly recommend looking into this company if you are a younger dividend growth investor. The downside is that the company is tied up financially due to these partnerships, and has the same negatives that consumer cyclical companies face. \r\n\r\nHAS has the ability to continue paying and growing due to its many brands lasting through the generations. Past names such as Transformers, Monopoly, Play-doh, My Little Pony, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic the Gathering transcend generations. Players of the beloved games and franchises often are hooked and want to collect more memorabilia. \r\n\r\nI hope someone out there found this post interesting.

It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.\r\n\r\n**Risks:**\r\n\r\n>\\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  \r\n>  \r\n>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)\r\n\r\n# Financial History:\r\n\r\nOne thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.\r\n\r\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|\r\n|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|\r\n|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|\r\n|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|\r\n|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|\r\n\r\nThe revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).\r\n\r\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|\r\n|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|\r\n|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|\r\n\r\nIncreases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \\~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.\r\n\r\nSo ...\r\n\r\n1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes\r\n2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes\r\n3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt\r\n4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes\r\n\r\n# Some other numbers:\r\n\r\nNOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.\r\n\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|Yield|2.76%|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|\r\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|\r\n\r\nFrom a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.\r\n\r\nLet's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)\r\n\r\n|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|\r\n\r\nDelicious.\r\n\r\n# Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nFrom a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.\r\n\r\nThere are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!\r\n\r\nEDIT: For those that cannot find the poll, [It can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/jxs9uy/which_of_the_following_would_you_like_to_see_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "score": 258, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1605978959.0, "tickers": [["JNJ", 5]]}

I’m very new to trading and investing (about 6months now) and things are going well, I’m about back to breaking even after some initial learning curve losses that I budgeted for. \r\n\r\nLong story short, my main strategy has been day/swing scalping but lately, I’ve been very interested with dividend yielding stocks/ETFs. So much that I’ve looked into the whole Dividend Capture strategy. Seems to work for some and criticized by others. I was wondering if anyone else has tried this and has it work for them. I understand that dividend capture is difficult because ex-dates typically open up less the dividend amount on the price. I’m looking to approach it 1 of 3 ways (or even test all of these out).\r\n\r\n1. Play the run-up to the ex-date. I notice typically on Q or A div payouts, there is a substantial price run-up followed by the expected drop off on the ex-date so you overcome the ex-date price difference, look for an entry about the same amount less in prior run-ups on ex-dates. This could be days or even weeks out. \r\n\r\n2. Play the ex-div date. Essentially buy on the ex-div date after the expected drop then just hold until the next ex-div date.\r\n\r\n3. Purchase shortly before the ex-div date and then just hold until I’ve covered my loss, having still captured the dividend.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to start this mainly on Monthly Ds and then try to apply this to Quarterly and up from there. While I understand that many people like to look at Quarterly Ds and focus on a spread to where you can get a regular payout each month. I personally think there’s an opportunity to play monthly’s the same and have a rotation for nearly every day of the month. Obviously not just dumping cash into whatever because of the Ex-D, but doing a comparison of the available on a certain day, and selection any from that (or not if none are appealing). \r\n\r\nAnyways, sorry for the length.

It recently came public following a merger with DDMX in 2020 and is the first Mexican company to list on the NASDAQ. With an estimated distribution network of 946,000 associates and 54,000 distributors, Betterware is rapidly expanding to cover its market Niche.\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\n43% Revenue growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 60% growth in 2020\r\n\r\n47% EBITDA growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 71% growth in 2020\r\n\r\n94% Free cash flow growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 105% growth in 2020\r\n\r\nGrowth is supported through 40% CAGR growth in employees from 2015-2020\r\n\r\n19.8% market penetration in 2019, targeted penetration is 26.8% in 2022. Highlights the very long runway Betterware has to grow their market\r\n\r\n5% dividend yield with significant ability to increase based on 94% growth in free cash flow\r\n\r\nSignificant competitive advantage in the distribution network results in 98.5% on-time deliveries with 2-day shipping(wow, that sounds familiar).\r\n\r\nInternational expansion is possible, with Colombia and Peru currently being targeted.\r\n\r\nDividends appear to be apart of long-term strategy with this quote pulled from the 10k \"Due to these low capital requirements and closed working capital cycle, the Company has high cash conversion rate enabling it to annually serve their shareholders through dividends.\"\r\n\r\nTrades at a 12.53 Forward P/E, which is extremely attractive when you factor in its growth rate\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n\r\nDistribution network requires a significant amount of people, pandemic significantly increased the need for work due to low employment, so talent was easier to attract. When the economy recovers, Betterware will likely find it harder to recruit associates to grow the distribution network.\r\n\r\nOnly issued dividends in the past 3 quarters, so we can not be certain this is a long-term stradegy.\r\n\r\nThe business has significant exposure to Mexican currency\r\n\r\nThe company is likely to experience volatile share prices as low liquidity and history should see significant moves both up and down. \r\n\r\nLast thoughts:\r\n\r\nThe company has insane potential to grow in both share price and dividend. The valuation likely only exist due to its low profile, having just debuted on the public markets, the argument could be made that this deserved to trade at 50+ multiple. The company has the potential to support massive growth going forward and shares similar characteristics to AMZN, BABA, & MELI all of which have been incredible investments for its shareholders.

{"name": "t3_k118g4", "title": "Dividend Capture Strategy", "text": "This tutorial is the process that I go through using dividend stocks to find and evaluate my swing-trades every month. If you have any idea’s or questions about the strategy, please comment below. \r\n\r\nLets say that we have a stock XYZ that pays a dividend on a monthly basis. At certain points during the month we might not know when the next dividend payment will “officially” be paid out. Most monthly dividend stocks pay their dividend in a pattern each month like on the 2nd Friday of the month or the 10th trading day of the month, etc. The company usually doesn’t publish this information but if you inspect the historical data then you can see the trend or pattern that they use for their ex-dividend date and record-date. We might be able to estimate when the ex-dividend date and record-date will be but until the company officially announces these dates then it will only be an estimate. The day when the company actually announces these dates is referred to as the dividend declaration date.\r\n\r\nAfter the dividend declaration date occurs we have all the dates that we need for the swing-trade, namely: the ex-dividend date, dividend record-date, and the dividend payable date. If we are not able to estimate these dates before the dividend declaration date then it will not be possible for us to do the analysis needed to setup our dividend swing-trade or dividend reinvestment position. For this reason, I typically only enter positions when the ex-dividend date has been confirmed by the company. \r\n\r\nNow that we have all the dates that we need we can start looking at what each one of these dates means.  If I want to collect the dividend on each share of XYZ that I purchase, then I must make sure that I buy XYZ shares before the ex-dividend date. If I buy a stock one business day before its record date, my trade will only settle the day after the record date. I would therefore not be a shareholder of record for receiving the dividend.\r\n\r\nSo, in order to make sure that I qualify for the dividend I want to buy the stock at least two business days before the date of record, or one day before the ex-dividend date. \r\n\r\n[Where to buy](https://imgur.com/a/ohm0AgT)\r\n\r\nUsing the graphic above as an example I would need to buy the stock on Monday the 5th to be eligible to receive the dividend payment. Monday the 5th is two trading-days before the date of record and one trading-day before the ex-dividend date. Now it should become more obvious why I use one trading-day before the ex-dividend date as the sell date for my swing-trades. This is a major part of my strategy as I use the run up into the dividend ex-date to make swings.  \r\n\r\nThe goal for my swing-trades is not to capture the dividend but rather sell my shares at a premium price to the buyers that are willing to pay a premium during the days leading up to the day before the ex-dividend date so that they will be on the record books and will therefore collect the dividend payment for the stock. You can receive gains many times the amount of the dividend by buying early and then selling the rights to these dividend shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date.\r\n\r\nPeople who are in search of high dividend yield using the dividend capture strategy are willing to pay a premium for their shares in the days just before the ex-dividend date because they don’t want to miss out on the dividend payment. The fear of missing out is a very motivating force in the minds of men and women alike and it can be seen in the data that I have collected over the last few years.  \r\n\r\nSo just to recap the overall strategy is to find a dividend stock that typically has a run up into the ex-dividend date.  To do this I look at historical data 2-14 days prior to determine when the run up into earnings typically starts. \r\n\r\n\r\nA couple of suggestions:\r\n1.)\tDon’t swing trade stocks that are at or very close to their 52-week high \r\n2.)\tLook for stocks that have been in a down trend since their last ex-div date \r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\nTo start I narrow my search to stocks that have an ex-date 2-3 weeks out.  This usually brings my window of stocks to research down to about 30-40 stocks.  For this example, I will be looking at stocks with a confirmed Ex-Date between 12/01/2020 and 12/10/2020 this narrows my window down to 18 tickers. \r\n\r\nThe stock Tegna (TGNA) looks to have a pretty good setup to me.  TGNA has a quarterly dividend.  At the moment it is about 20% off of its 52-week high..  For this example, I am going to look at the previous 24 dividend Time Periods to determine statistically when Is the best time to buy. \r\n\r\nThe below chart shows historically what day has been the best day to buy if I plan on selling the shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date. The chart shows from 2 days out all the way to 14 days out as I have found this Is the sweet spot for the run up into ex-dividend. \r\n\r\n[Historical % returns by day](https://imgur.com/a/Ovuuyh9)\r\n\r\nIt is clear that for TGNA buying 13 – 14 days out is the way to go (remember this is looking at the pasts 24 dividend periods or 6 years).  Though all of the days running up into ex-dividend are positive.  This is a great sign as history is on our side that this is a good stock to dividend swing trade with. Meaning that historically if I consistently bought all days 2 through 14, I would have been profitable.  To take it one step further I look at what would have happened if I bought 14 days out for each of the previous 24 dividend swing plays. \r\n\r\nIn the below chart you can see the exact percent gains for each of the last 24 dividend swing trades if I went with the 14 day out strategy.  When taking a closer look, we can see that there have been swings has high as +30% and as low as -10% which is huge.  I prefer to take a safer approach as I am really only going for a small 3-5% gain each month as I have found that works a lot better in the long run.  \r\n\r\n[14 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/OhWXVxY)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo go with a more conservative approach I look at the previous 24 dividend periods for 6 days out.  What I find is that only 2 / 24 previous swing trades on day 6 would have resulted in a loss and only one of those periods would have been significant.  This is more of my style and likely the play that I will go with. \r\n\r\n[6 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/zZG1zZh)\r\n\r\nSince the confirmed ex-date for TGNA is 12/10 I will be looking to buy on 12/2 and sell on 12/9.  For this specific example looking at the data I can see that days 2-14 have all be profitable I will likely buy in slowly over the entire period with the majority of shares bought on 12/6.  \r\n\r\nI have used this strategy for quite some time and have basically perfected it to the point where on average I am getting returns in the 2-5% region per month.  There are other ways to improve this strategy as well, but I wanted to see if people here were interested in this type of swing trade.   \r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Terminology: \r\n\r\n Ex-dividend Date: Is the day in which the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value.  Investors who purchased the stock before the ex-dividend data are entitled to the next dividend payment while those who purchased the stock in the ex-dividend date, or after, are not. \r\nconfirmed ex-dividend date – This is the ex-dividend date that has been officially announced by the company on the dividend declaration date. \r\n\r\ndividend capture strategy – A dividend capture strategy is a timing-oriented investment strategy revolving around the purchase and sale of dividend-paying stocks. Dividend capture is specifically the practice of buying a stock just prior to the ex-dividend date in order to capture the dividend, then selling it immediately after the dividend is paid. \r\n\r\n\r\ndividend record-date – The record date, or date of record, is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution.", "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "created_utc": 1606339455.0, "tickers": [["TGNA", 3]]}

{"name": "t3_k0izks", "title": "Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) - A Stock Review/Guide - Chose this from the Comments", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nGood morning/evening everyone. The poll is about to close out so I'll be doing the other stock reviews here soon based on the results, but anyways, Intel was one of the stocks requested in the comments by  [hhh888hhhh](https://www.reddit.com/user/hhh888hhhh/), so let's take a look.\r\n\r\nLet's start by taking a look at the business model.\r\n\r\n# INTC - Intel Corp:\r\n\r\nIt is one of the the world's largest and highest-valued semiconductor chip producers. Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system manufacturers, produces motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers, integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.\r\n\r\nIntel breaks itself down into the following segments:\r\n\r\n>**- Client Computing Group** – produces hardware used in desktop and notebook computers  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- **Data Center Group** – produces hardware used in server, network, and storage platforms  \r\n>  \r\n>**- Internet of Things Group** – offers platforms designed for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings and home use  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- **Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group** – manufactures NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint, branded as Optane, products primarily used in solid-state drives.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- **Intel Security Group** – produces software, particularly security, and antivirus software.  \r\n>  \r\n>**- Programmable Solutions Group** – manufactures programmable semiconductors.  \r\n>  \r\n>The YoY growth of these segments can be found [here.](https://www.intc.com/segments)\r\n\r\n**Strengths:**\r\n\r\n>\\-  Intel’s core business has broad exposure to growing market segments, particularly:  cloud, data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\-  The company is successfully migrating from a PC-centric business to a data-centric business  \r\n>  \r\n>\\-  Intel stock is very cheap right now (P/E 8.9 November 2020), this could potentially lower the risk profile and boost rewards potential.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- They have been very strategic with their previous acquisitions.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- As we will see when we look at the financials, their books up to the start of 2020 are solid.\r\n\r\n**Risks:**\r\n\r\n>\\-   INTC is immersed in a semiconductor market that, while having stronger long-term growth potential, is highly cyclical. Big up years are followed by big down years. This is just the result of supply/demand cycles in the market.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Intel is gradually losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), and other competitors. (NOTE: AMD & NVIDIA will not be discussed here, this post is for INTC)\\*\\*\\*  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Litigations. This is common for corporations this size. For intel it is mostly antitrust lawsuits.\r\n\r\n\\*\\*\\*Interesting note about AMD in the next section.\r\n\r\n# Financial History:\r\n\r\nSomething that was really interesting is, after going through a bit of Intel's 10K I got curious and checked out AMD as well. Right in the very beginning AMD has this as their disclaimer:\r\n\r\n>***Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.***  \r\n>  \r\n>Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.\r\n\r\nThat really says a lot about the stength Intel Corp has in this market. Incase anyone is curious, [here is the source.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248817000043/amd-12312016x10k.htm#sC2A00DC72E841F4EC97A655066A6893F) Risk Factors, page 13.\r\n\r\nAnyways let's look into the financials over the last 10 years.\r\n\r\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|$53,999|$23,571|$10,800|0.5|\r\n|2013|$52,708|$20,323|$16,418|0.8|\r\n|2015|$55,355|$22,713|$25,511|1.05|\r\n|2017|$62,761|$26,179|$34,673|1.3|\r\n|2019|$71,965|$32,861|$33,285|1.0|\r\n\r\nThe revenue has increased an average of 3% YoY, the earnings has increase right along side this. Best has increased gradually, nearly x3 over the 10 years, but it is still only 1x the earnings. Very healthy, especially when we jump into this next section and talk about the cash flow.\r\n\r\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|20,960|10,764|15,370|\r\n|2015|19,020|7,326|21,168|\r\n|2019|33,145|16,213|17,697|\r\n\r\nCash flow from operations has increased about 5% YoY over the decade, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 5% as well. $33 Billion in cash flow is pretty crazy, especially considering they still have half of that left over after Capital Expenditures. They have been using the excess cash flow to pay down some debt (\\~750 Million in 2019), dividend out, and buy back shares. Over the decade the outstanding shares have decreased by 2% YoY from 5,256 to 4,417.\r\n\r\nWhat is crazy is that Intel is trading at about an 8x multiplier. Their P/E puts them in a nice range for this to be a very strong value play as well, especially considering they are already well established in a sector that is growing rapidly.\r\n\r\n# What are their plans for the future?\r\n\r\nIntel's intentions are to establish a lead in key technologies that are fundamentally changing computing and communications today and for tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTheir priority areas for continued growth:\r\n\r\n* Cloud Services\r\n* IoT (Internet of Things)\r\n* Artificial Intelligence\r\n   * Intel is acquiring SigOpt to Scale AI Productivity (October 2020)\r\n* 5G\r\n* Intelligent Edge\r\n* Autonomous Driving Technology\r\n\r\nHow they intend to deploy their capital:\r\n\r\n* Investing into R&D to strengthen their competitive position.\r\n* Strategically invest/acquire companies to stimulate data-centric growth.\r\n* Return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\r\n\r\n# Current Dividend History:\r\n\r\nIntel Corp has only had 6 years of Continuous Dividend Growth at this time.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.\r\n\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$1.32|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|Yield|2.81% (Based on  $47.01 Price Nov 2020)|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|\\-|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|7%|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.6%|\r\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|24.26%|\r\n\r\nFrom a dividend growth standpoint, the payout is very low, however their growth is extremely promising given the low payout of only 24.26%, and the fact that this company produces gobs of free cash flow.\r\n\r\nLet's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 7% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)\r\n\r\n|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|Payout|$1.41|$1.51|$1.61|$1.73|$1.85|\r\n\r\n# Closing Thoughts:\r\n\r\nAt its current price, with the strong financials, and overall excellent business growth prospects, this stock would best be considered a really strong value play. The dividend is there and there is very strong potential for growth, however the payout is still a bit low. Now for a very long term hold, this could be an excellent entrance price, especially if they were to start increasing the dividend growth rate as they increased their cash flow.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. There are always more risks that need to be considered, additionally it is always smart to **read opposing views, don't just read what will validate what you want to believe about a stock.**\r\n\r\nThe poll ([It can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/jxs9uy/which_of_the_following_would_you_like_to_see_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) will be closing out soon, so the 2nd place and last place will have their reviews written as time allows. There were some requesting a review for Realty Income (O), it will be done likely after the other 2 or whenever, evaluating REITs is a bit of a different process due to their required 90% payouts.\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!", "score": 146, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "created_utc": 1606270081.0, "tickers": [["AMD", 4], ["INTC", 3], ["AI", 1]]}

Price fluctuates from 10 to 22 (total return might be affected on exit)\r\n\r\n- Still high costs due to the split of 2015\r\n\r\n## Financial History and numbers\r\n\r\nNumbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HPQ/balance-sheet?p=HPQ) as of Nov 26 2020\r\n\r\nCurrent Annual Payout/Share | $0.78\r\n-----------------------------|--------\r\nYield                    | 3.48%\r\n10 Yr Div Growth Rate    | 16.29%\r\n3 Yr Div Growth Rate     | 9.18%\r\n1 Yr Div Growth Rate     | 9.99%\r\nYears Of Growth          | 10\r\nCurrent Payout Ratio     | 29.71\r\nFree Cash Flow / Share   | 2.64\r\nRevenue                  | 56.6M\r\nDebt / Equity Ratio      | -2.79\r\n\r\n(napkin math: 6,217,000/-2,228,000= -2.79)\r\n\r\nHPQ has pretty healthy financials. The payout ratio is low but the negative debt to equity ratio is a red flag. HPQ claims that they are still streamlining their processes and in response to covid, they are committed to buying back shares and closing real estate locations. Consumer demand most noticeably (and predictably) increased due to COVID, so I think that post streamlining and supply chain recovery, HPQ can look good in 5-10 years.\r\n\r\nThe free cash flow year over year is increasing too. The dividend increases are outstanding. In fact, let’s project this forward to guesstimate the future payouts. (These are estimates, the actual payouts can range differently)\r\n\r\nYear | Potential payout (based on 10.29%)\r\n------|------------------------------------\r\n2021 | 0.86\r\n2022 | 0.95\r\n2023 | 1.10\r\n2024 | 1.27\r\n\r\nHPQ is shown on finviz to have a 112.3% ROI. That’s some value for your risk right there. HP's [dividend history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/dividends/history) makes it all the more appealing to me.\r\n\r\n## Takeaway/Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\n- Is there revenue growth? Yes… kinda\r\n\r\n- Is there earnings growth? Yes\r\n\r\n- Is the company really leveraged? Yes (high debt)\r\n\r\n- Is there strong cash flow? Yes\r\n\r\nHPQ to me is an excellent speculation play for dividend growth. The company is widely recognized and has room for paying out (which they seem committed to). The dividend growth is amazing. The downside is that HP does not increase in price very well. And that negative debt to equity ratio. Therefore, I would recommend this to those aiming to preserve capital (or as a bill payoff) more than to raise capital. HPQ has the ability to continue paying and is committed to growing that dividend.\r\n\r\nI hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research.

{"name": "t3_k2srtp", "title": "Walmart (NYSE: WMT) - A stock review/guide - 2nd Place Winner in the Poll", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nGood morning/evening everyone. The poll closed out with Walmart placing 2nd and Honeywell placing last, so these two will get stock reviews, starting today with Wal-Mart.\r\n\r\n# Walmart | Save Money - Live Better:\r\n\r\nSector: Consumer Defensive\r\n\r\nWalmart is America’s largest retailer by sales, selling a variety of general merchandise and grocery items. It operates 11,300 stores in the US, which account for approx 76% of sales in fiscal 2019, with Mexico and Central America \\~6%, the UK \\~6%, and Canada \\~4% beings  its largest external markets.\r\n\r\nThe company operates several e-commerce properties apart from its site, including Flipkart, Jet.com, and shoes.com (it also owns a roughly 10% stake in Chinese online retailer JD.com). As of 2019, e-commerce accounted for only \\~5% of fiscal 2019 sales. However the e-sales growth during the pandemic has greatly increased this.\r\n\r\nWalmart has been smart with its acquisitions and partnerships. Walmart has partnerships with Instacard, ThredUp, Shopify, and even Google. The Instacart partnership, together accounts for [nearly half](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png) of all online grocery sales. The partnership with Thredup allows Walmart to sell cheaper clothes on its online marketplace, and Shopify allows 3rd party sellers to sell their goods on Walmart's marketplace as well. Lastly, the Google partnership provides customers voice-enabled grocery shopping and likely much more in the future. Walmart's partnerships and acquisitions are taken to further complete with and provide a market alternative to Amazon.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see more of their partnership/acquisitions [please look here on page 2.](https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2019/annual/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf)\r\n\r\n**Strengths:**\r\n\r\n>\\- Walmart is the largest retailer in the world providing it unequaled power to leverage their vendor's, suppliers, and manufacturers, keeping prices low with national and private brands.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Walmart's cost advantage provides significant barrier to entry and is consistently used to disrupt their competitors.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- The company is aggressively investing in its e-commerce segment and focused on strategic acquisitions to complete with Amazon. (Mentioned in the last paragraph above)  \r\n>  \r\n>\\-  The partnership with Google is has the potential to be particularly strong due to Walmart lacking strong tech exposure.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Walmart PLUS memberships, 2 hour delivery, and expansion into drone delivery services.\r\n\r\n**Risks:**\r\n\r\n>\\-  Walmart employs millions people and is facing intense pressure to raise wages. This will have an effect on their profit margins.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Amazon. Amazon is much much more than just e-commerce.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Walmart's profit margins aren't as wide as they could be due to keeping prices lower, this does bring them more sales revenue, but they have to be very wary of any competitors lowering their prices further to undermine Walmart's position and margins.\r\n\r\nAmazon's threat to many of the traditional brick and mortar industries cannot be understated. Amazon's model is nearly the example of a monopsony, the opposite of a monopoly. They aren't interested in dominating one sector, but ingraining themselves into literally everything. This is why Amazon's model is so disruptive.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Amazon is often the company that raises the conversation of wage increases to undermine it's competitors. The [wage increase to 15$](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181002005317/en/Amazon-Raises-Minimum-Wage-to-15-for-All-U.S.-Employees-Including-Full-Time-Part-Time-Temporary-and-Seasonal) was much more than them \"listening to their critics\", it was a move to further pressure any of their competitors whose margins cannot effectively absorb this cost burden. This tactic, along with Walmarts cheap pricing tactics, is what allows Amazon to nab up companies very cheap. ([See the whole diapers deal](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-quidsi-diaperscom-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos-2020-7)).\r\n\r\n# Financial History:\r\n\r\nFor Walmart we will be looking at the 5 year financials rather than the 10 year due to their push more recently to get into the ecommerce markets.\r\n\r\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2016|$478,615|$33,559|$49,994|\\~1.5|\r\n|2017|$481,371|$32,884|$45,930|\\~1.4|\r\n|2018|$495,761|$30,966|$46,470|\\~1.5|\r\n|2019|$514,405|$32,635|$58,033|\\~1.8|\r\n|2020|$523,964|$31,555|$72,400|\\~2.3|\r\n\r\nThe revenue is honestly just insane and shows how large Walmart is, plus it is something like 80-90% of the US population lives within 15 miles of a Walmart or something? Anyways, $478 Billion to $523 Billion, about an average increase of 2.2% YoY. Not bad, they are continuing to grow, but just ahead of currently inflation rates. When we look at EBITDA though, their margins are shrinking/lumpy.  This, based on the company movement, and from what they say in their 10K, this decrease is largely attributed to them moving into e-commerce. These numbers may be significantly different next year since their ecommerce has been growing pretty significantly during the pandemic, [they are estimated at 97% annual growth there](https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-ecommerce-sales-reach-sky-high-growth-in-recent-quarter-2020-8). However note that ecommerce, despite this increase is still a very small piece of the company right now, it is going to take awhile for it to have a more significant impact, but the growth is absolutely there.\r\n\r\nThe debt is increasing due to acquisitions as well as investment into the ecommerce segment as well. The 2.3x debt/earnings is a bit higher than their historic levels, but again, they are investing right now, and it is still lower than a 3x where it starts to be a bit more concerning.\r\n\r\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2018|$28,337|$10,051|$16,840|\r\n|2019|$27,753|$10,344|$29,444|\r\n|2020|$25,255|$10,705|$13,479|\r\n\r\nCash flow from operations is definitely in line with the decreasing EBITDA so that makes sense. Their CAPEX been consistent the last few years, nothing to really note there since the e-market stuff has already been mentioned. Now for the Free Cash Flow, in 2019 there is a significant jump, this is because in 2019 they took on \\~$12 Billion in debt load, this was added to the FCF/E for whatever reason, we can subtract it and say that is was more likely \\~$15/16/17 Billion, which is in line with the decline. In 2018 and 2020 they were making debt payments, appears to be about 1.5 Billion for each of those years, hence the lower FCF/E there.\r\n\r\nOver the years, in addition to the dividend, they do appear to be using some of their capital to buy back shares, those have decreased from approx 3,200 - 2,850 outstanding over the last 5 years or so. Some would say this is the better way to give back to the shareholders rather than dividends, but others say that it is a way for companies to create synthetic earnings. Take what you will from that. Typically healthy (large) companies will do both dividends and share buybacks, so take what you will from that.\r\n\r\n# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:\r\n\r\nWalmart (WMT) is a Dividend Aristocrat that has paid and increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.\r\n\r\n|Stock Price|$151.60|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|P/E Ratio|21.89|\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.16|\r\n|Yield|1.42% (Based on  $151.60 Price Nov 2020)|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|7.2%|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|1.9%|\r\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|34.45%|\r\n\r\nStrictly from a Dividend Growth perspective, the payout is a bit low and the dividend growth has sharply decreased as the company continues to focus on e-market expansion. In addition to this, the yield on cost is of lower value right now, had the stock been purchased earlier when it's price was closer to 100$, it would have been an excellent buy, at the current price and yield though, there are better prospects.\r\n\r\nFrom a value perspective... well Walmart over the years has traded closer to an 8x multiple, it is currently over 20x. Based on this alone it would be considered overvalued based on its financials, however one also needs to consider that higher multiples are typically paid for companies with stronger growth prospects...which leads us to growth.\r\n\r\nFrom a growth perspective, Walmart is a market titan, the growth will be gradual over longer periods of time, but there are many factors that need to be considered from this perspective (as well as the others):\r\n\r\n>\\- Will their e-market investments pay off or will they lose market share due to more competitors in the business and pressure from Amazon?  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Will the decline of brick and mortar stores offset the earnings from the e-market?  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- How much could they expand their margins by automating warehouses amoung other segments?  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Do their traditional brick and mortar stores provide Walmart a significant distribution advantage over Amazon? (80-90% of Americans within 15 miles of a Walmart mentioned above)  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- How will Wamart continue to nurture their relationships with Google and Microsoft and will it continue to make smart and strategic acquisitions?  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- How will future government policies and labor unions affect both Amazon and Walmart?\r\n\r\nThere are so many different unknowns that need to be considered.\r\n\r\n# Closing Thoughts:\r\n\r\nWalmart is an absolute titan of a company that is transitioning to have a significant e-market presence. Compared to Amazon, Walmart is currently the underdog that still needs to be very cognizant of it's other competitors, like Target. However, their recent partnerships and acquisitions have enabled the company to expand significantly online during the pandemic, and unlike Amazon, they have a wider physicals presence, stores that can act as distribution centers amoung other things.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Amazon is very likely to continue to dominate, however, Walmart does have the potential to start edging their way into the different market segments and start taking pieces of the pie for itself. Amazon is certainly aware of this, hence the reason it pushes timely wage-increases and other policies to undermine its competitors. Government policy is a significant factor to both due to their sheer size and presence.\r\n\r\nAt the end of it all, you need to ask yourself, do you think Walmart can continue compete, and continue to work its current business model? Or perhaps you'd take more the side of why not both?\r\n\r\nI hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. There are always more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views, read up on Target and Amazon. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!", "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "created_utc": 1606588018.0, "tickers": [["PLUS", 1]]}

Take a very close look at where your paychecks are going towards, most companies automatically have you invested into retirement funds with 0.70-1% expense ratios because they know a majority of people don’t look. While I think it’s better than not contributing to retirement at all, expenses do really start eating up into your compounds.*\r\n\r\nRoth: 80% VTSAX (Total Market) yielding 1.71%, 20% VTIAX (Total International) yielding 2.56%. *Note: Simple 2 fund portfolio, I don’t care too much about Vanguard’s domestic/international split in their world fund. My risk tolerance is high but I know that doesn’t apply to everyone else. A general rule of thumb is 120-age=stocks and whatever % is left goes towards bonds. For example let’s say someone is 25, they would have 95% in stocks and 5% in bonds.*\r\n\r\nTaxable: 75% IVV (SP 500) yielding 1.94%, 20% QQQ (Nasdaq 100) yielding 0.61%, 5% WSB yielding ???. Bonuses: Apple yielding 0.70% and PepsiCo yielding 2.83%. *Note: I prefer IVV over VOO simply because of its higher dividend yield of 1.94% compared to 1.78%. I guess if you look at it, it’s also a way to diversify between my taxable and retirement accounts. You definitely don’t want to put all your eggs in one company. Now with that being said, I also have 20% in QQQ. Contrarily to what you may have heard, QQQ isn’t a pure tech fund. It simply tracks the top 100 non-financial companies in the Nasdaq. It just so happens that tech is the big player here, it’s sector and holdings will be adjusted accordingly. It has the aggression I’m looking for despite having overlaps between IVV.

Outside the core of my portfolio, any bonuses or additional income I get from side hustles I use that to build positions for fun to feel “involved” in the market.

My only requirements are I have to actually like the company so much that I’ll be able to commit to investing a minimum of 10K and it has to have a dividend. So far I only have two companies in my project but I have my eye on a few companies such as Chase.\r\n\r\nEdit: This is a collective breakdown of all my accounts as one.

I have a couple stocks that I've gotten like a 42% return on and would love to watch them grow more, however they pay nothing in dividends. 2) How many is too many? Is it better to dump a lot of money into say 5 dividend stocks or a little money into 20? I know that diversification is important, but I also feel like most if not all the high dividend stocks I own are solid AF and not going anywhere anytime soon, so should I try to buy as much of those as possible to increase my dividend potential or keep it spread out?

Stag Industrial's equity price has enjoyed a lovely increase over the years for an industrial REIT. Really pretty impressive for a company in their sub-sector. They do seem to check all the boxes for a lot of us: monthly dividend, industrial focus, trying to be e-commerce resistant *and/or* embrace e-commerce distribution centers. Apparently Ben Butcher is also respected as being very good at acquisitions. Yet, the dividend grows within a fraction of a fraction of a penny over years. Dividends are a policy decision... they do not necessarily reflect on a company's growth plan.\r\n\r\nSo, the company is growing fundamentals. FFO growth is steady. They issue shares accretively. The actual dividend paid shows nil growth. \r\n\r\nWhat are your bull cases on STAG? If they didn't pay monthly, would you still be invested? Do you approve of their policy of keeping dividend increases minimal? Do you think this will be a 60 (or 50, or 40) dollar stock in 5 to 7 years or grow their dividend in a meaningful way?\r\n\r\nEdit: for what it's worth I'm bullish on the company and it is the one I am currently building a full position in. They recently offered another share offering with a price of around 30.40 a share based on the 8 million share offering with an additional 1.2 million shares to be potentially sold.

(NASD: GRMN) \r\n\r\n#**Sector and Industry**\r\n\r\nGarmin Ltd. operates in the technology sector under the scientific & technical instruments industry. The industry has seen [appreciated 21.33%](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) in the past year. Garmin has slightly outperformed this growth with [23.61% share price appreciation]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN) in the past year. Annual industry earnings growth is [at 7.22% for the last five years]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) with Garmin significantly outperforming at [21.60% in the same time period](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN).\r\n\r\nGarmin is the [second largest scientific & technical instruments company](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=ind_scientifictechnicalinstruments&o=-marketcap) by market cap, second only to [Fortive Corporation](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTV). GRMN’s market cap [currently sits at $22.78B]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN). Garmin makes up around 14% of the industry’s [$168.06B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name).\r\n\r\n#**The Company**\r\n\r\nGarmin Ltd. offers products in [five main categories](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/profile?p=GRMN): automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. In 2019, revenues were split between the segments as follows:\r\n\r\nSegment|Revenue\r\n:--|:--\r\nFitness|28%\r\nOutdoor|24%\r\nAviation|20%\r\nAuto|15%\r\nMarine|13%\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a positive catalyst in Garmin’s marine, outdoor, and fitness categories. Overall, the Company experience a 19% increase in third quarter 2020 revenue, quarter-over-quarter. This is exceptional growth, especially considering Garmin’s exposure to aviation.\r\n\r\nAs of the Company’s [third quarter 2020 earnings call](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf), marine revenues increased 54% quarter-over-quarter on increased consumer interest in boating and fishing. Garmin’s fitness segment saw a 35% increase in revenue from its wearable and cycling products. Notable, Garmin recently launched the [Venu Sq smartwatch](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/707174). The Company’s outdoor segment saw revenue increases of 30% with strong sales increases for the [adventure watches](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/outdoor_recreation/adventure-watches/c12520-c16900-p1.html) product line.\r\n\r\nGarmin did see decreased revenues it its automotive and aviation operations due to the affects of COVID-19. Automotive revenues decreased 6% in third quarter 2020, compared with the same quarter in 2019. The Company has introduced several exciting new automotive products, including Garmin Catalyst: “[an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf).” In the same quarter, the Company became a Tier 1 supplier for BMW automobiles.\r\n\r\nThe Company’s aviation segment suffered revenue decreases of 19% due to COVID-19. The Company does not manufacture or sell aircraft itself. However, Garmin does expect aviation sales to fall a further 17%. Increases in owner flown aircraft will help to mitigate some losses. One of Garmin’s most exciting products in the segment is its Autoland technology.\r\n\r\n#**Autoland**\r\n\r\nGarmin’s Autoland is “[taking the next step towards autonomous flight](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/)” by allowing aircraft to be autonomously landed through a single button press. The Autoland system considers environmental factors, chooses a viable airport, communicates with ATC, and then lands the aircraft on an available runway—all while providing updates to passengers. These updates include location, fuel, destination airport, and arrival time. Garmin’s research into autonomous landing may remind investors of Tesla, which is developing self-driving capabilities. Garmin’s Autoland should not be underestimated—it could become the base for full autonomous flight.\r\n\r\nAutoland can only currently be used in emergency situations where the pilot is not capable of landing the aircraft. “Autoland directs the aircraft to a suitable airport nearby for landing based upon a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, weather, terrain, approach, runway and aircraft suitability.”\r\nIn third quarter 2020, the FAA certified Autoland for [use on the Cirrus Vision Jet](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/), adding to its previous certifications for the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940.\r\n\r\nI spoke with a pilot regarding the Autoland technology. He “expects Garmin's new automatic landing systems will be found in most general aviation TAAs [technically advanced aircraft], in the next decade.” Many pilots around the world share that sentiment, especially during a time of great advancements in autonomous vehicles.\r\n\r\n#**Valuation**\r\n\r\nYear|Revenue*|EBITDA*|FCF*\r\n:--|:--|:--|:--\r\n2016|$3,018,665|$741,900|$705,682\r\n2017|$3,087,004|$777,691|$660,842\r\n2018|$3,347,444|$882,153|$919,520\r\n2019|$3,757,505|$1,068,560|$698,549\r\n\r\n*In thousands of USD; from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/financials?p=GRMN).\r\n\r\nGarmin has seen consistent revenue growth in the past five years but the earnings growth is even more impressive at [21.60% annual EPS growth](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company’s consistent EPS growth is indicative of its quality management and sustainability. The earnings growth has been priced into the share price at a [PEG of 3.23](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN). It should also be noted that free cash flows have fallen year-over-year amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company remains fiscally healthy with [just $58.42M in debt and cash of $1.65B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN).\r\n\r\nTicker|GRMN\r\n:--|:--\r\nPrice|$118.48\r\nMarket Cap|$22.78B\r\nP/E|22.51\r\nPEG|3.23\r\nP/S|5.70\r\nDividend|2.04%\r\n\r\nStill, the Company is fundamentally solid and will likely continue to grow. Garmin currently pays a [dividend of $2.44 per share, which is 2.04% of its share price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company has increased its dividend payout in the [past eight consecutive years](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GRMN/garmin/dividend-yield-history); this makes it a good candidate for dividend growth investors. Garmin will become a dividend champion in the likely case that its payout increases the next two years.\r\n\r\n#**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nGarmin has seen immense growth in its marine, outdoor, and fitness segments. The Company’s investments in its Autoland product have put it at the forefront of autonomous flying. Garmin is a clear innovator in its industry and will likely continue to outperform the overall market.\r\n\r\nI personally believe Garmin’s investments in autonomous flight will make it a leader in the industry, much like Tesla has become in automotive self-driving.\r\n\r\n**Note: The opinions expressed in this passage are for general informational purposes only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual or on any specific security or investment product.

{"name": "t3_k5gr2l", "title": "Pretty big deal overhaul of the subreddit rules", "text": "Good afternoon r/dividends,\r\n\r\nAs this subreddit has continued to grow, evolve, and mature, I have increasingly noticed that us moderators have become limited by the rules.  Not in their existence, but in their descriptions.  I have begun to notice posts created by honest, longtime, good faith users that were bordering on the line between acceptable and unacceptable content.  Even some posts that we moderators would deem as unacceptable, but could be loosely interpreted as acceptable if one was not aware of a rule's context.\r\n\r\nTo rectify this conundrum, I have rewritten the rules to better reflect how the moderation team is **actually** moderating content on this subreddit.  This is not me creating new rules out of thin air, but instead expanding on the rules that already exist.  Clarifying them, and making them easier to understand by drawing a giant metaphorical line between what is acceptable and what is not.  If you did not feel this change was necessary, that is good, because it means we moderators have been successful in keeping this rule-breaking content out of view.  So thank you, it really means a lot.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the sidebar, or visit [https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/about/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/about/rules), you will notice things look very different, but simultaneously familiar.  In this post, I intend to walk you through every single change that has been made. (Note: I did use r/personalfinance as inspiration for rewriting the rules.  However, there are several key distinctions (most notably is that we allow meta content here).  Enough that while the rules have a similar format, having a thorough understand of r/personalfinance's rules would not be a substitute for understanding the rules of r/dividends.\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, let's begin:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**Rule 1: Submission guidelines**  \r\n>  \r\n>Posts must be a dividend question or discussion with a descriptive title. General investment, brokerage, or financial discussion is also allowed but subject to a higher bar of quality.  \r\n>  \r\n>We do not allow:  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Hypothetical or improbable questions  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- News or information without a discussion or summary  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Links without context  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Open ended questions, surveys, or polls without context.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Portfolio Reviews (use weekly stickied Megathread)  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- NSFW material  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Questions already answered by the wiki\r\n\r\nThis rule is an encapsulation of all the things that if any moderator sees in your submission, it will be removed without a second thought.  These items have been the justifications used for removals for a long time, but they used to fall under the umbrella of a bunch of different rules.  It was just easier on our end to combine these.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**Rule 2: Self-promotional advertising or solicitation**  \r\n>  \r\n>We do not allow:  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Promotion of web content, products, services, companies, or anything else owned by you (or anyone affiliated with you), even if not monetized.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Offering referral, invite, or affiliate links/codes.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- PM/DM requests or offers.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Soliciting business/investors, media requests, or recruiting.  \r\n>  \r\n>Requires pre-approval: Customer service replies, and open-sourced tools.\r\n\r\nThis is the successor to the old Rule 1.  It clarifies our stance on self-promotion.  The rule also absorbs the old rule 6, which prohibited referral links.  It codifies the prohibition on PM/DM requests, as well as solicitation.  A reminder that broker generated links to share one's portfolio do not count as referral links.\r\n\r\nNow, let's say you are the official account for some product or service, and someone posts about how they had a horrible experience or whatever with your product.  If you want to reply publicly to the OP in your account's official capacity, then you must seek moderator approval.  Attempting to turn a customer service reply into a self-promotion opportunity will be met with a ban.\r\n\r\nNow let's say you are developing some independent, open-sourced dividend tracker or whatever and you want to discuss it with the community.  Reach out via modmail and we will address those on a case by case basis.  Just because you are not monetizing it does not make it exempt from our rules.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**Rule 3: Unhelpful or disrespectful**  \r\n>  \r\n>We do not allow:  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Directly insulting other users  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Insincerity or dishonesty  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Trolling, loaded questions, loaded language, or provoking unproductive conversation.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Novelty accounts that post \"in character\"  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Posting purely for upvotes  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Excessive large, bold, or spaced-out text  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Requesting votes/fewer votes  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Excessive profanity  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Overly political discussions  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Petitions or calls to action  \r\n>  \r\n>- [Poor redditquette](https://bit.ly/2vKxaO6)\r\n\r\nEverything here should be pretty self explanatory.  All of it was already prohibited.  I do not think I really need to explain anything here.  This is an investing subreddit, not one based around politics.  This is also a subreddit dedicated to kindness and respect, not insults and arguments.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**Rule 4: Solicitations for due diligence**  \r\n>  \r\n>We do not allow:  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Asking another user to research a company, security, or other investment for you.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Requesting due diligence be done on your behalf.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Asking for privately prepared market research conducted by a third party.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Offering to conduct due diligence in exchange for any form of compensation.\r\n\r\nSome people find this rule incredibly difficult to follow.  Some users do not seem to understand this rule exists.  Some users are under the impression that ETFs were somehow exempt from the old Rule 4.  Some users were unaware that it is expected users of r/dividends conduct their own due diligence prior to purchasing any security.  With these thoughts in mind, I rewrote rule 4 to be more comprehensive, and to clarify.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**Rule 5: Lawbreaking information**  \r\n>  \r\n>We do not allow:  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Suggesting another user perform an activity that is illegal, unlawful, or fraudulent in most jurisdictions.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Linking to illegal content or lawbreaking information  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Asking for advice on any of the above\r\n\r\nPretty self explanatory.  \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**Rule 6: Personal attacks or abusive language**  \r\n>  \r\n>We do not allow:  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Personal attacks  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Raw criticism without constructive feedback  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Name-calling, shaming, or other harassment  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Advocating self-harm or violence against others  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Abusive language  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Intentionally rude or overly harsh language\r\n\r\nNeed I even comment?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**Rule 7: Low effort content**  \r\n>  \r\n>We do not allow:  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Circlejerking or karmawhoring  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Memes or image posts  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Clickbait titles  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Insubstantive or ephemeral content  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Soapboxing or political grandstanding  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Rants or other incendiary remarks  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Incoherent or incomprehensible arguments  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Discussion deemed not to be conducted in good faith\r\n\r\nIf you create a post whose sole content is a URL link to an image, you are not clever.  It will be removed.  Clickbait titles should be obvious what those are.  Google's autocorrect does not seem to recognize what insubstantive means, so to avoid any confusion, according to a Google search, insubstantive is an Adjective meaning \"Unable to be substantiated; unfounded.\"  So no objectively fake news like \"Warren Buffet died three days ago.\"  If you cannot prove it, then do not say it.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>**Rule 8: Unauthorized bots**   \r\n>  \r\n>We do not allow:  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Unnecessary bots or bot summoning  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Attempting to mimic the functions of a banned bot  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Other unauthorized bot activity  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>Authorized bots are distinguished with a unique user flair indicating their status.  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>  \r\n>Bot authorization is granted solely by the moderation team.

Broadstone is considered diversified, but when you look at its state by state holdings, it looks more and more like a restaurant REIT. It's not, but it looks like it is. \r\n\r\nIts structure is a little strange to me. It may actually be more normal than I think, but the way they spell it out is rather up front. Does anyone know anything about UPREIT structure or OP units? I wouldn't qualify of course since I'm not a millionaire and I think their website reminds of when it was private rather than public... The REIT shares are still easily liquid to the rest of us but they really seem to go about investor relations differently than most.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm curious if anyone has opinions on BNL. I may have asked about it before, but that was before I was aware of the problems with Red Lobster. Its low multiple suggests risk, yet they're offering the same dividend from before they went public / prior to covid and could easily offer great equity returns once the virus is mitigated. I noted several executives went to the Simon Graduate School of Business for their MBA degrees, which is a plus considering I recently learned Realty Income's CEO went to my alma mater UChicago... and management matters as much as assets, sometimes.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1607189550.0, "tickers": []}
{"name": "t3_k7au1c", "title": "Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) - A stock guide/review", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nGood morning/evening everyone. This is the last stock review for the first poll that closed out last week. The current poll just closed and it looks like AT&T took it. So that will be next.\r\n\r\n# Honeywell International:\r\n\r\nSector: Industrials\r\n\r\nHoneywell operates as a diversified technology and manufacturing company worldwide. It breaks itself down into the following segments:\r\n\r\n* Aerospace segment:\r\n\r\n>Offers auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, integrated avionics, environmental control and electric power systems, engine controls, flight safety, communications, navigation hardware, data and software applications, radar and surveillance systems, aircraft lighting, advanced systems and instruments, satellite and space components, and aircraft wheels and brakes; spare parts; repair, overhaul, and maintenance services; thermal systems; and connected solutions and data services for the aftermarket, as well as wireless connectivity, and management and technical services.\r\n\r\n* Building Technologies segment:\r\n\r\n>offers advanced software applications for building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for energy management; access control; video surveillance; fire products; remote patient monitoring systems; e-cooling heat transfer agents; and installation, maintenance, and upgrades of systems.\r\n\r\n* Performance Materials and Technologies segment:\r\n\r\n>offers automation control, instrumentation, and advanced software and related services; catalysts and adsorbents, equipment, and consulting; and materials used to manufacture end products, such as bullet-resistant armor, nylon, computer chips, and pharmaceutical packaging, as well as Honeywell forge connected solutions.\r\n\r\n* Safety and Productivity Solutions segment:\r\n\r\n>provides personal protection equipment, apparel, gear, and footwear; gas detection technology; and cloud-based notification and emergency messaging; and mobile devices and software; supply chain and warehouse automation equipment, and software and solutions; custom-engineered sensors, switches, and controls; and software-based data and asset management productivity solutions.\r\n\r\n**Strengths:**\r\n\r\n>\\- Strong record of successful products and brand innovation.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Automation of activities has enabled the company to scale up/down production based on the demand conditions in the market.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Strong Free Cash Flow.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Decent Returns on Capital Expenditure and mergers + acquisitions.\r\n\r\n**Risks:**\r\n\r\n>\\- Honeywell International needs to put more money in technology investments to maintain relevancy and innovation edge.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- The company has lost market share in many categories listed above due to strong competition and companies undercutting prices.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Investment in R&D is below the fastest growing players in the industry.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Industrials are highly cyclical.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Honeywell is more subject to fluctuations in the US gov defense budget. (This has been stable, however that is not to say that won't change in the future)\r\n\r\n# Financial History:\r\n\r\nThis next section will include information up to their 2019 yearly 10k. However, for 2020 (based on their quarterlies) they definitely haven't been doing terrible. The Space and Building segments are definitely down, however the Safety and Productions segment has helped buffer the loss during the market downturn. So the diversification into multiple industrial segments has definitely helped them. They have been doing so well over the last decade, in fact, [they were reintroduced to the DOW Jones](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-dow/salesforce-amgen-honeywell-to-join-dow-jones-industrial-idUSKBN25K2J9) in August. (They were previously removed in 2008).\r\n\r\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / EBITDA|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|$36,529|$3,531|$6,896|2|\r\n|2013|$39,055|$6,490|$7,441|1.1|\r\n|2015|$38,581|$7,711|$6,113|0.85|\r\n|2017|$40,534|$8,314|$13,924|1.7|\r\n|2019\\*\\*\\*|$36,709|$8,592|$13,191|1.5|\r\n\r\nLooking here it would seem they have decreasing revenue between 2017-2019, however the decrease there is actually because they sold their Transportations Systems portion of the Aerospace segment into a standalone publicly-traded company (Garrett Motion Inc.), and also part of the Building Technologies to a public company (Residio Technologies Inc), so the decrease in revenue is attributed to those sales. ([Item 7 of the most recent 10K, page 17](https://investor.honeywell.com/Cache/IRCache/09f14eba-f828-c545-c341-6b1f333ff270.pdf)). So if we account for this then Honeywell has definitely been growing revenue over the decade. This can be seen in the earnings which have increased on average 11% YoY.\r\n\r\nDebt has doubled, but considering the increase in earnings and revenue, and the low debt to begin with, it isn't too notable. The Debt/EBITDA ratio here is only about 1.5, so they are definitely not too leveraged. Note, the debt calculations above are short term + long term debt.\r\n\r\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|$2,830|$789 Million|$2,453|\r\n|2015|$5,519|$1,073|$3,626|\r\n|2019|$6,897|$838 Million|$5,880|\r\n\r\nCash flow lines up with with earnings, even accounting for the spin outs mentioned above. The CAPEX is pretty low, it does mean they are generating very good sums of money with the investments they are making, but Honeywell needs to ensure it is investing to maintain competitiveness. Free cash flow is very strong. Based on their sheets, in addition to the dividend, they are  using some of this to buy back some shares, 773 to 715 from 2011 to 2019.\r\n\r\n# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:\r\n\r\nHoneywell is a Dividend Achiever that has paid and increased its dividend for 10 consecutive years.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.\r\n\r\n|Stock Price|$208.22|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|P/E Ratio|29.91|\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$3.72|\r\n|Yield|1.79% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|10.8%|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.1%|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|10%|\r\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|48.06%|\r\n\r\nThis will be broken this down from a dividend perspective, and then a value perspective. The dividend growth for the company has been fantastic, consistently at 10% over the entire decade that hasn't slowed down, plus the payout ratio is a low 48%. Based on their free cash flow this is quite sustainable moving into the future. The CEO has mentioned plans to shift the dividend growth to match growth in earnings (Averaged at \\~5%), so this could potentially increase/decrease the growth rate based on those numbers.  From a value perspective however, the price of \\~208$ is expensive, and some would say overvalued. Because of it's price, the yield is a low 1.79%. Based on the dividend alone the stock would have been more of a fair value when it was priced closer to 150/160$ (Yield \\~2.4%). however there are some arguments against this.\r\n\r\nHoneywell has been moving to a more subscription based service with its products, this model has a tendency sharply increase revenue for successful companies with worthwhile products and often causes them to trade at higher P/E and books ratios. In addition to this they are also partnering with Microsoft for cloud services. According to their CEO, Honeywell is aiming to become more of a controls company, using software across industries to control the flow of data. This move and partnerships support the higher price tag for the stock and helps explain why they are trading at a higher ratio, much like tech companies do.\r\n\r\n# Closing Thoughts:\r\n\r\nAll in all, Honeywell is a well run company, they have strong financials, decent diversification, and competent leadership. Whether of not you feel the price is a good entry point depends on whether or not you believe the company should be trading at more a premium based on its financials, products, and future goals. Some would say the rally from \\~$104 - $208 (March 2020 - Dec 2020) caps its short term potential and increases its downside.  That said, the company's aerospace segments look strong, and management has a clear pathway to growth through its digital and IoT initiatives.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure but you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company.

Links posted cause issues with rejected posts.\r\n\r\nI played with the full Dividend Champion - Challenger - Contender list for the last couple days. I'm a fairly \"young\" investor as I still have a bit of time in the market so most of my portfolio is situated around high growth stocks/ETFs but I will have a good chunk of SCHD & DGRW/DGRO for long term dividend growth. I figured I would see if there would be some good opportunities for myself but mainly for my father in law though. He's recently retired and has some money to put into a dividend portfolio.\r\n\r\n**Starting Metrics** \\- Anything that did NOT meet that standard I culled.\r\n\r\n\\- *3-6% Dividend Yield* (Most are fairly \"safe\" within this range and safe/long term dividend income was the goal).\r\n\r\n\\- I gave a little leeway for COVID so I culled anything that hadn't had a dividend \"increased\" since Sept 2019.\r\n\r\n\\- Looked for an increase in Dividend Growth when comparing 5yr&10yr dividend growth (%) - \"5yr/10yr Accel/Decel\" - I wanted this to be as close to 1.00 or higher. I gave a little leeway so set at 0.80 Ratio\r\n\r\n\\- Minimal 2-Billion Market Cap (sounded good and wanted legitimately large companies)\r\n\r\n\\- At least 4-Payouts / yr (Quarterly or Monthly Payers Only)\r\n\r\n\\- >/= 10% Stock Price Growth (5y Chart on Robinhood/Seeking Alpha) - Anything lower was culled.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI ended up with a list of 31x Dividend Growth stocks that actually have some share appreciation. I color coded the stocks with 2x shades of green. The darker green shaded stocks actually have >30% share price appreciation over 5yrs. Then I started just going through each thing I knew how to somewhat interpret on the excel sheet and cull things at random. I looked for a minimal goal and then shaded that light green and darker green with things I felt were \"good\"/\"better\".I'd love to hear your thoughts on these 31x stocks. Interested to know if I am on my way to helping him out in a meaningful way and not misleading him. I also left a lot of the EPS and EPS growth and a ton of other things in there. I know some sectors you can evaluate them one way or another but with some they are going to be fairly different. I will say, looking at the PEG though, you can tell that we've had some record highs going on. A lot of those are priced pretty overvalued at the moment. Unfortunately I think that's just how it's going to stay going forward (with the exception of this December sell off that is most likely going to happen with the volatility of TSLA finally getting into the S&P 500 on the 21. Look out for some good deals within a few days after that!\r\n\r\n\\*The picture is \"edited\".

Having one of the world’s largest content creators combined with AT&T’s services could be powerful. (This will be discussed further below)\r\n\r\n**Risks:**\r\n\r\n>\\- Lots of debt. This company is quite leveraged. The Time-Warner merger increases AT&T’s debt to the point the company balance sheet should be watched intensely.   \r\n>  \r\n>\\- AT&T is largely concentrated in the US right now.   \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Intense competition from Verizon and other telecom giants. \r\n\r\n# Financial History:\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the financials AT&Ts goals need to be discussed. Recently they appointed a new president for the company, their stated goals include bringing down their overall debt, increasing their earnings and cash flow through the HBO and Warner acquisitions, remaining committed to the dividend, and the sale of underperforming assets to streamline capital investments. \r\n\r\nThis first chart will break down their Revenue, Earnings, Debt, and Debt Ratio over the decade. The source of the information is the company 10K SEC filings. \r\n\r\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Short + Long Term Debt|Debt / EBITDA|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|$126,723|$32,443|$65,573|2|\r\n|2013|$128,752|$47,005|$75,293|1.5|\r\n|2015|$146,801|$45,551|$129,613|2.8|\r\n|2017|$160,546|$45,572|$165,665|3.6|\r\n|2019|$181,190|$56,172|$191,680|2.9|\r\n\r\nRevenue as increased 5% YoY, it is pretty solid, for a company this large that has been around for as long as it has double digit growth is definitely not expected. Earnings has increased \\~9% YoY over the decade, outpacing the revenue, this is nice since it is increasing their margins. \r\n\r\nDebt has definitely grown at a significant pace, this is largely based off their acquisitions over the recent years. Back in 2015 they acquired Direct TV (gross), and in 2018 Time Warner + HBO. In both 2015 and 2017 you can see the spike in the debt to EBITDA levels above the 3x we would normally like to see, however AT&T has stated they are committed to reducing their debt levels, their stated objective is to bring debt/EDITDA below 2.5x. Already we can see at the end of 2019 that they have managed to bring the ratio down to 2.9, which is a good trend, something that, based on their quarterly earnings this year, they have been continuing. \r\n\r\nLet's take a closer look at the cash flow, and their debt payments.\r\n\r\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|Debt Payment / Influx|\r\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\r\n|2011|$34,743|$20,272|$14,833|\\+362 Million|\r\n|2013|$34,796|$21,228|$22,706|\\+9,138 Billion|\r\n|2015|$35,880|$20,015|$39,792|\\+23,927 Billion|\r\n|2017|$38,010|$21,550|$52,342|\\+35,882 Billion|\r\n|2018|$43,602|$21,251|$11,023|\\-11,328 Billion|\r\n|2019|$48,660|$19,635|$15,430|\\-13,603 Billion|\r\n\r\nNet cash flow is very strong and growing \\~4% average. Their CAPEX line has been steady, but note that it does not include the cost of any mergers, acquisitions or purchases.\r\n\r\nNow, the Free Cash Flow to Equity is looking really weird in 2015 and 2017, the reason there is such a spike in FCF/E is because those are the years AT&T loaded up on new debt, note the spike in Long Term Debt in the previous chart, the influx of cash from those loans is simply being added to the FCF/E here.  If they are subtracted the ratio more in line with the $15 Billion they have averaged. \r\n\r\nLastly, the debt payments. After the acquisitions, we can see that in 2018 and 2019 they have been making substantial debt payments. Based on the recent quarterly earning they have continued to pay down the debt load.\r\n\r\nSo, thus far we have seen increasing revenues and earnings, strong free cash flow, and an increase in debt repayments. Good trends, yes the company is still leveraged, but not as leveraged as some other companies we have recently looked at (Looking at you IBM - they are currently approx 4x debt/EBITDA)\r\n\r\nAnyways, let's now take a look at the acquisitions before discussing the dividend. \r\n\r\n# Direct TV:\r\n\r\nAT&T acquired DirectTV in 2015 for \\~$67 Billion dollars. Since then (and even before the acquisition), It has YoY decreasing profits as more and more people move away from traditional expensive cable in favor of streaming. Already they are looking to action off Direct TV, with optimistic guesses it'll likely sell for around $20B Billion. There is no doubt that this was an absolute failure and questionable decision, even in 2015, given the trends. This is one of the largest factors causing the former CEO Stephenson to be replaced. \r\n\r\nSelling Direct TV would allow AT&T to continue off-loading legacy, and capital intensive segments to boost free cash flow to focus on growth of more profitable (and not declining) company segments. It does come with a stinging loss of over $40 Billion just from the sale alone. The new CEO, Stankey, seems more than ready to just offload Direct TV, use the cash to invest back into the company, and move on. \r\n\r\n# Time Warner (Warner Media) and HBO: \r\n\r\nThese acquisitions were incredibly expensive for AT&T, however, unlike Direct TV, they are becoming significantly more profitable. The profits for Warner Media in Dec 2019 was \\~9.5Billion, these numbers are down for 2020, however much of the loss is attributed to the impacts COVID has had to the entertainment industry. Now, the introduction of HBO Max streaming was botched and delayed, this gave significant ground to Disney and Apple as they released their streaming services, however, HBO Max is reported to have \\~38 Million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. Their stated goals are to have over 50 Million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 Billion by that time. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on HBO Max. This move is definitely putting AT&T on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from Netflix and Disney will be. Warner does still have agreements with AMC, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. This just highlights how significant the move into streaming by Disney and AT&T have been. Yes AT&T was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and Warner Media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot more to the Time Warner and HBO piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points. \r\n\r\n# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:\r\n\r\nThe AT&T is a dividend Aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.\r\n\r\n|Stock Price|$29.54|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|P/E Ratio|19.44|\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.08|\r\n|Yield|7.04% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\r\n|Current Payout Ratio (Based on Earnings)|58.26%|\r\n\r\nThe payout ratio may seem lower here, however, using the Cash flow from the chart above, in 2019 their total cash flow from operations was $48 Billion, minus the CAPEX of \\~$20 Billion leaves around $28 Billion in free cash. According to their 2019 10K the amount paid out in dividend distributions was \\~$14.8 Billion. So just about half of the free cash, leaving the rest to be paid towards short/long term debt, or whatever other financing activities.  \r\n\r\nHowever, AT&T under their new leadership has several ways to go about increasing their margins here. Firstly, they could pay down debt to decrease future debt payments, this is one route they have mentioned they are committed to. Another is they could cut their dividend payment. The new CEO and management have stated they are committed to the dividend, however, this is a route that could be taken to further increase the cash flow for the company which could be used for more aggressive debt payments, and reinvestment back into the company to further stimulate growth and increase the profitability of their Media segment. \r\n\r\nNote though, AT&T has not been buying back shares at this time, in fact the number of outstanding shares has increased from 5,926 to 7,305. This does dilute the value of the stock, however, over the short term (especially if you are holding more long term), this isn't necessarily bad. You will see less price appreciation, but because they are paying out a dividend it will allow you to accumulate more shares through DRIP, so later on when the company can afford to buy back shares in addition to payout a dividend distribution you will see the benefits from the compounding effect of accumulating shares, and stock price appreciation. This ofcourse assumes that the company will move itself in a position to afford this. So the question you'd have to ask yourself here is whether or not you believe AT&T can manage their debt, whether their telecommunication services will remain relevant, and whether their Media services can turn more a profit. \r\n\r\n# Closing Thoughts:\r\n\r\nThis stock is definitely more controversial but hopefully this post helped highlight some key points. With the new CEO in management it will be interesting to see how AT&Ts current position changes. They have been trending towards completing their stated goals like bringing down debt, and investing into their media services. \r\n\r\nIf you're not sure if you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, please supplement this with your own research. \r\n\r\nA quick disclosure, I do own AT&T stock, but that says nothing! Do your own research! There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.  \r\nThanks for reading, and have a good day/night!", "score": 272, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "created_utc": 1607218372.0, "tickers": [["TV", 4], ["ABBV", 1], ["PG", 1], ["IBM", 1]]}

I am back again for another speculation analysis. Obligatory warning: I am in the computer science space, This is just my take on the pharmacy field.\r\n\r\nSector: Healthcare (pharmaceuticals)\r\n\r\n## Company Strengths & Risks:\r\nWBA:\r\nWBA owns Duane Reade and Walgreens with global outreach and beauty brands.\r\n\r\n> -rapidly increasing total assets\r\n\r\n> -Decreasing total equity\r\n\r\n> -(Speculation) WBA seems to be going for accessing all medications rather than making deals with insurance like CVS is doing\r\n\r\nWBA has been slimming down its costs for years. This is good for a rebound play. WBA has a historic yield between 2-3%. Due to covid, it has jumped to a 4% yield. WBA has also been committed to increasing the dividend payout.\r\n\r\nCVS:\r\n\r\nCVS is ranked 5th on the Fortune 500 list. CVS recently merged with Aetna. CVS has been aggressively partnering with insurance to drive growth. \r\n\r\n> -Revenue has been up year over year\r\n\r\n> -Shifting operating expenses to benefits costs\r\n\r\n> -Assets nearly doubled from last year\r\n\r\n> -Aggressively growth oriented\r\n\r\n> -(Speculation) From the pharmacists I have spoken with, CVS is willing to shift locations of pharmacists if they do not maintain a quota to maintain and raise profits at the expense of the workers\r\n\r\nCVS has been rapidly shifting its views towards growth rather than dividend growth. They are just as committed to paying dividends as WBA, just not as focused on increasing their dividends right now.\r\n\r\n## The Maths\r\n\r\nWBA: \r\nNumbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBA/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WBA/balance-sheet?p=WBA) as of Nov 26 2020\r\n\r\nCVS: \r\nNumbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVS/balance-sheet?p=CVS) as of Nov 26 2020\r\n\r\nStock                          |  WBA     | CVS\r\n-----------------------------|-------- | --------\r\nStock price                  | $43.41 |  $74.50\r\nCurrent Annual Payout/Share | $1.87 | $2.00 \r\nYield                       | 4.31%* |  2.68%\r\n10 Yr Div Growth Rate       | 13.63% | 20.69%\r\n3 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 6.88%  | 5.57%\r\n1 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 3.06%  | 0%\r\nYears Of Growth             | 43     | 0\r\nCurrent Payout Ratio        | 38.79% | 26.91 %\r\nFree Cash Flow / Share      |  4.69   |  9.63\r\nRevenue                     | 139B  | 266B\r\nDebt / Equity Ratio         |  .738  | 1.394\r\n\r\n\\* Historic yield of about 3%\r\n\r\nWBA is the better bet for dividend appreciation. CVS seems better for growth and balance sheets. This can be seen as WBA dropped from 59.08 in December 2019 to 35.43 in September 2020, for a drop of 40%. This price hasn't recovered yet. Compare this to CVS of 73.57 in December 2019 to 57.32 in September 2020, for a drop of 23%. CVS clearly is less volatile. \r\n\r\nPotential payout based on 3 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary)\r\n\r\nI will set back CVS a year to mimic its current behavior.\r\n\r\nYear | WBA  | CVS\r\n------|------------| ---------\r\n2021 |  2.00    | 2.00\r\n2022 |  2.13    | 2.11\r\n2023 |  2.28    | 2.23\r\n2024 |  2.44    | 2.35\r\n\r\n## Amazon Entering the Pharmaceutical Space\r\nAmazon recently announced that they were entering the pharmaceutical space. I want to give my thoughts on this and why I think this news is being overhyped.\r\n\r\n- Amazon is not entering the narcotic space. Pharmacies are still needed for that. As with flu shots. Getting this all in one place is still a “pharmacy” aspect that I do not think Amazon can mimic yet.\r\n- Which leads to the pandemic aspect. I dont know many pharmacists willing to directly expose themselves to other people’s homes. Safely behind a veil at the counter or booth is one thing but open contact with another is up for debate to me. \r\n- Human and expert aspect: Human interaction cannot be understated to me. Yes it is faster with Amazon’s automation but having an actual source of blame or connection is understated to me. \r\n- Widened information spread- Everyone who has access to your Amazon account will have access to your order history and cart. Sure, it may just be for Ibuprofen or Hydrocortisone but this may still be something that you want to keep private.\r\n- Multi Accounting to abuse the system. If a person has more than one amazon account, it is reasonable to assume that uniqueness of prescriptions may not be possible. After all, how do you distinguish between 2 pictures of prednisone (a corticosteroid, aka steroid) prescription? This can lead to easier overdoses. I am not certain that all doctors will accept Amazon, even for a while. Thus, “duplicating” prescriptions may become a problem.\r\n\r\nThat all being said, convenience, couponing with online sources like Honey, and gift cards are all aspects that Amazon has over pharmacies. To my knowledge, pharmacies are facing issues with people claiming to have not received their medication or that the designated recipient never received/delivered the medication is an ongoing issue. Amazon’s solution with signed and ID’d delivery can combat this. That being said, I still think people are underplaying the roles of pharmacies. If you need to get a narcotic or controlled substance at the pharmacy anyway, it is logical for me to assume that you would rather still have your prescriptions picked up at the pharmacy.\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nBoth WBA and CVS will be titans for decades to come. WBA is stronger for dividend growth. CVS is better to me for its approach to growth. CVS did not drop as far as WBA did and CVS quickly returned to its pre-pandemic price. This shows stability to me. WBA can be a much better rebound play if one wishes.\r\n\r\nI hope someone out there found this post interesting.

Even after this big run up the past month or so, it still is a buy at current prices. If pent up demand can lead to sales growth in 2021, as many analysts are now predicting, that could mean Kohl's dividend could easily get back close to what it was pre pandemic. So even if you got in at the current share price of around $41, yield on cost would be fantastic. \r\n\r\nAnd that isn't unrealistic at all, as this company is in good financial shape despite the pandemic. Much better than it's competitors. Their one quarter at the start of the pandemic, they reported losses, but since then they have managed to pull off narrow profits despite all of the headwinds with the virus. these headwinds have been devastating for JcPenny and Macy's, two companies that were already skating on thin ice before the virus. \r\n\r\nMy theory is that Kohl's fills a nice niche in the market where it is kind of like the middle ground shopping experience. What other physical store can someone go to to get the department store experience without the big price tag? \r\n\r\nTarget and Dicks sporting goods are the only true competitors that Kohl's has to compete with for this niche now, but sometimes people just want to go to Kohl's. If I were to go out clothes shopping, I was strictly shopping for clothes, and I could only pick one of these 3 to go to, Kohl's would be the clear best choice. \r\n\r\nI think the Kohl's leadership understands this.\r\nThey know that their true competitors are Target and Dicks. They have been fending off Dicks in the athleisure and sports wear categories quite effectively for awhile. They announced a new athleisure product line a few months back which will also help them fend off competition not only from Dicks but also Lululemon who are trying to establish themselves in this space. [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/kohls-challenges-lululemon-with-new-athleisure-line-2020-10-20%3famp)\r\n\r\nSo they seem to effectively be fending off competition in the sports wear and athleisure categories, but they have been pretty weak on beauty products in the past, as this market grows. Target has been beating them in beauty, and Kohl's has been striking back with their own beauty product lines, although they are far behind Target which has a deal to carry Ulta beauty products in their stores. This has been a weak point for Kohl's. The Sephora deal which was announced last week, and will see Kohl's open 200 Sephora shops in Fall 2021, will be key to success in the fight for beauty products with Target. Kohl's says it plans to expand Sephora shops to at least 850 of their store locations by 2023.

I read a few posts today posting they hit 2000 and 3000 a year in dividends. Sure you can't retire off that... but that is $166 a month and $250 a month... that alone pays most peoples phone bill, internet bill and a utility payment (electric, water, gas) in that month.

I was thinking of limiting the test prior to covid, say from 2015 to 2019, but I thought otherwise and will say why I've done so because I believe reality still supports the dividend stock on a time-frame from 2015 to 2020.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2015&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=0&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=true&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=QQQ&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=O&allocation1_1=100\r\n\r\nIf you look at the period from 2015 to 2019, O was neck and neck with the QQQ trust in terms of total return. This was a period when tech absolutely boomed and people thought commercial real estate was a boomer idea, so to speak. Had you invested in O in 2015 you would be about even with a trust that tracks the most promising of the profitable tech companies, megacap included. Neck and neck with the best of the best. Until this year. I understand backtests only say so much, but not everyone can invest the day they were born. It's worthwhile to compare a stock in a sector few cared about to a sector that attracted mass adoration in its boom time.\r\n\r\nYou only see the real deviation with covid, when commercial real estate share pricing dived due to market sentiment (and, yes, temporary but real commercial rent collection decline).\r\n\r\nI have no bias against the Nasdaq 100. They're fine investments in my eye, provided you're selective.\r\n\r\nBut let us have a moment for people who bought what is likely a melt up and neglected one of the kindest entry points for a real estate company that can issue debt for free in years... and which performed as well as one of the most booming sectors this decade... despite being a boring old REIT.\r\n\r\nThe divergence in 2020 is clear. O's share price was brought down to Earth and I'd recommend QQQ as a fairly safe growth fund most of the time provided one continually invests. Should I focus only on growth in share price and a secular incline, I'd buy the trust and would sleep at night. Tech is great. I'm not knocking it. It's not 2000 for the most part.\r\n\r\nI will say it's highly impressive O matched its returns even in a very recent period. If you think a crisis year caused a melt up in certain sectors due to a frothy and ignorant market which might turn down as froth is known to do... then other sectors are prime rib to one's teeth right now. \r\n\r\nAnd if you know of a company that can issue free debt* besides O right now, let me know, because I think investing in O is one of the most forward looking actions one can take as the year ends.\r\n\r\nIt is all about the entry point, sometimes.\r\n\r\n*By free debt I mean issuing nearly a billion dollars in debt at less than even meager inflation expansion, some of which is due in the next decade. Real cost of capital is effectively 0 for Realty Income in an acquisition boom year for triple net real estate companies. I do understand individual companies shouldn't be compared to ETFs generally, but I make an exception here.

{"name": "t3_kco79a", "title": "Lam Research - A speculative analysis (LRCX)", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nWelcome back everyone. I am back again for another speculation analysis. \r\n\r\nSector: Technology (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials)\r\n\r\n## Company Strengths & Risks:\r\nLam Research is a wafer fabrication supplier for the semiconductor industry. Now let me break down that sentence for the non-techie’s of the subreddit. Wafers are thin components for semiconductors. A semiconductor is a material that can mimic and flip between a conductor (let electricity pass) and an insulator (not allow electricity). They are made small and thin so as to minimize time between instructions. \r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Required for circuitry and technological advancements\r\n- 5G on the rise- they will need wafers in mass production\r\n- Very high growth ceiling\r\n- WFH and corona was a boon to the business (mostly positive, precautions still in place)\r\n\r\nRisks:\r\n- Lots of competitors. Not certain if all are on the stock exchange but Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA (KLAC), Teradyne (TER), Entegris (ENTG), MKS Instruments (MKSI), and Brooks Automation (BRKS) are some decent ones to compare\r\n-  This is a growth stock more than a dividend growth stock. They do grow the dividend but this is being evaluated more based on growth than dividend (to be ranted about later)\r\n- Depth and complexity of chips will always increase. This is the flipside to growth. It has the balance sheet, and I am not worried. But as technology evolves, semiconductors need to evolve too. Like stronger NAND flash (usbs and SD cards) for a short example.\r\n- China ban/embargo. Demand will remain but if the US is banned from exporting to China, it will need to be rerouted elsewhere. Immediate response is that they are in the application process as of Q3 earnings call, of getting the license to ship to China. As a positive, this shows their dedication to stick to their ethics and corporate compliance policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Financial History and numbers\r\n\r\nLRCX: \r\nNumbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LRCX/balance-sheet?p=LRCX) as of Dec 12 2020\r\n\r\n\r\nStock                        |  LRCX\r\n-----------------------------|-------- \r\nP/E Ratio                    | 27.9 (forward P/E 19.64)\r\nStock price                  | $491.70 \r\nCurrent Annual Payout/Share | $5.20 \r\nYield                       | 1.06%\r\n10 Yr Div Growth Rate       | -%\r\n3 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 49.37%  \r\n1 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 8.89% \r\nYears Of Growth             | -\r\nCurrent Payout Ratio        | 23.24% \r\nFree Cash Flow / Share      |  14.05\r\nRevenue                     | 3.3B\r\nDebt / Equity Ratio         |  1.12\r\n\r\nLam Research has been paying a dividend since 2014 and has increased the dividend quite consistently. The payout ratio of 23% tells me that they have room to grow for a while. The downside is that the rate of increasing dividends is inconsistent but it does grow. But from a growth perspective, Lam is up 533% in 5 years, up 79% in 1 year. I don’t think this growth is anywhere close to done. I am uncertain as to why seeking alpha does not list years of growth but I will leave it empty due to that.\r\n\r\nPotential payout based on 1 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary)\r\n\r\n\r\nYear | LRCX\r\n------|------------\r\n2021 |  5.66  \r\n2022 |  6.16\r\n2023 |  6.71 \r\n2024 |  7.31  \r\n\r\n## Growth Potential Rant\r\nOne of my main realizations early on is that technology is ever evolving. In this day and age, it seems to be going exponentially rather than linearly. Circuitry is at the baseline of technology. \r\nDa Vinci Surgical Robot: A couple of months ago, you may have seen a video of the Da Vinci Surgical Systems robot allowing minimally invasive surgery. While this robot was not made by LRCX, it just shows the evolution of technology and how circuity is coming to other sectors. \r\nThe rise of 5G: We’ve heard it all over. 5G is coming. Guess what, semiconductors will be involved. I think this may be the safer play rather than speculating on the communication sector, or the first company to release 5G. Instead of betting on those, why not speculate on safe suppliers of 5G components? Well what happens after 5G becomes mainstream? I don't think this is even close to the pinnacle. Years ago, LTE and 4G were phenomenal. Now 5G is the new buzz. Technology evolves. What will come in the future to make 5G obsolete? I’m near certain semiconductors will be involved.\r\nOther electronics: As technology evolves and semiconductors are further optimized, I expect other electronics to adapt too. Motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, tablets, remote controlled toys, and so much more all benefit from semiconductor optimization. Faster command execution, cheaper products, smaller products. There is just so much room.\r\nWe are approaching the point where technology can do things that may not be needed. [Robo Dog](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). Point in case, we are optimizing robotic pets.\r\nI really don't see the upper bound of semiconductor use. Technology will keep evolving so semiconductors will evolve with them.\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts:\r\n\r\nI don't want to oversell my conviction but I think this sub-industry may be one of the Teslas of dividends. This stock is barely talked about, unlike disruptive stocks like SQ. This company has room to sprint, keep paying dividends, it's practically all we want out of a growth stock but pays a growing dividend too. When the biggest downside is the many competitors, and yet they are still rocketing, I think they are positioned well for the future. \r\n\r\nI hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, please give me feedback so that I can increase my standards for future analysis posts.", "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "created_utc": 1607911506.0, "tickers": [["SD", 1], ["STZ", 1]]}

I will list them in my personal order of preference but it’s up to you to choose one and only one and stick to it.\r\n\r\n1) Industrials - $LHX (highest conviction pick) OR $LMT > $NOC\r\n\r\n2) Financial - $AMP OR $TROW > $AFL OR $BLK\r\n\r\n3) Consumer Staple - $TSN OR $HRL\r\n\r\n4) Technology - $AVGO OR $TXN\r\n\r\n5) Consumer Discretionary - $LOW OR $HD\r\n\r\n6) Healthcare - $ABBV (my 2nd highest conviction pick) OR $BMY OR $MRK\r\n\r\n7) Communication Services - $NXST (broadcasting station)\r\n\r\n8) REITS - $HASI (renewable energy infrastructure REIT), $IIPR (cannabis REIT), $DLR (data storage REIT)\r\n\r\n9) Materials - Avoid. This sector is far too cyclical and commodities price dependent to provide us the reliable dividend growth we seek.

I've always thought of growth as a measure of the stock's increase in value.  Are there separate ETFs that focus on stocks that increase in valuation while still paying a dividend?

I will explain my reasoning and look forward to your opinion.\r\n\r\nThe GEO Group is a REIT that owns and operates Prisons primarily in the USA for State and Federal agencies.\r\n\r\nReward: They currently pay a 14.2% dividend. Prior to COVID, they paid a quarterly dividend of $0.48 which would result in a dividend of 20% dividend if it returns to that rate. My assumption is they will return to a quarterly dividend of $0.42 in 2 years.\r\n\r\nRisks:\r\n\r\n1. Biden has made a campaign promise to eliminate private prisons.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts:\r\n\r\n* Many politicians make this promise but very hard to do because of GEO's political giving and a large number of jobs in key states.\r\n* If Republicans hold on to the Senate it seems very unlikely. There is a 70% chance that the Republicans can hold on to the Senate according to the betting sites.\r\n\r\n1. COVID law suites - There have been a few law suites but they are handling COVID pretty well.\r\n\r\nMy thesis, is prisons will remain private, perhaps 1 will be converted to the public for political reasons but that won't happen for 3 to 5 years. Several COVID lawsuits but it will be managed.\r\n\r\nIn 2 to 3 years 16% to 20% percent dividend and a 50% stock price increase. My model shows my $12,000 in stock will have a compound return to $39,000 in 10 years and then result in a yearly income of $2300 a year.\r\n\r\nMy downside is calculated at 1/2 my investment - $6,000\r\n\r\nIt's a high risk / high reward.\r\n\r\nPlease provide your thoughts/analysis.

It's also pure random chance whether your portfolio will do better than an index -- and by adding individual stocks you introduce the possibility of making mistakes, and are more likely to underperform than over-perform.\r\n\r\nThe stability and safety of dividend paying companies does not preclude that they may be overpriced, or that you'll buy and sell at the wrong times.

Diversification is a backstop against ignorance, and if you are ignorant then just buy an ETF.\r\n\r\nArguments about fee drag are silly when you can find an ETF with expense ratio of 0.10% or less very easily - about as significant as a rounding error.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIt concerns me when people read the dividend investing literature, and their takeaway is that it doesn't matter what company you invest in as long as they continue to pay a stable dividend. \r\n\r\nIt's entirely possible for a stock to pay a steady, increasing dividend but still have a flat or *negative total return* over a multi-year period - even with all dividends reinvested.\r\n\r\n[Example 1: PPL](https://i.imgur.com/d8sjjtU.png)\r\n[Example 2: IBM](https://i.imgur.com/gpbDYrI.png)\r\n\r\nMarket-cap weighted ETFs or index funds will add larger weight to winners and automatically kick out losers over time, which helps solve this problem without you doing anything.\r\n\r\n**TLDR** If you do enough research to confidently buy individual stocks, narrow down to your best 10 ideas and exercise some discipline by kicking out the rest. \r\n\r\nif you own a lot of different stocks and ever consider asking the internet \"is my portfolio good\" then you'd be much better off owning an ETF.", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "created_utc": 1608690532.0, "tickers": []}

I would like to officially thank him for taking the time to participate in this community. The event turned out to be a massive success by every metric. I was genuinely blown away both by the number of questions and by the number of his responses.  Some statistics:\r\n\r\n- 264 total comments.\r\n\r\n- 53 questions answered.\r\n\r\n- 100% of questions asked during the initial two hour window were answered by Mr. Barnes, as were a few additional ones the next Monday. \r\n\r\n- Most upvoted answer: Taco Bell as his favorite fast food restaurant. \r\n\r\n- 37 rule breaking comments removed.  If you asked a question during the original two hours, and it didn't get answered it means it was either a duplicate and got removed, or it broke the rules and got removed.\r\n\r\n- Most common reason for removal: People asking Brian for a job. \r\n\r\n- 0 permanent bans issued. \r\n\r\nMy locking of the post was entirely prearranged. It is the intended strategy for every AMA that will be conducted on r/dividends.  Once the host indicates to me that they are done answering questions, I will lock it for them so they do not get notifications for the next six months until Reddit archives the post.  It also helps on the moderation side. \r\n\r\nWith that being said. My eyes now turn to the next AMA. I have become a fan to the idea of the CEOs of brokerages hosting AMAs. I think it fits perfectly with the subreddit, and considering how it works with the community since people seemed to really like it, I want to continue this trend.\r\n\r\nSo while all the PR teams representing these CEOs are on vacation for the holidays, now is the perfect time to discuss who should host AMAs here on r/dividends. No suggestion is a bad one. \r\n\r\nHowever, I will issue a piece of advice. I have noticed that when I am reaching out to these companies, I am often hearing back responses about how they don't really understand what Reddit even is, or why it would be important.  As a retail manager, I can be incredibly good at getting people on board with an idea while simultaneously making them think it was their idea. Here is my conundrum.\r\n\r\nFor PR teams, the CEOs time is money. They need the most metaphorical bang for their buck. PR teams want interviews. They understand the idea of eyeballs, media, and attention. If you give them a large enough potential audience, they will jump through hoops to learn this new medium, and will work to promote the company.\r\n\r\nThis is how Reddit itself got Obama to do an AMA. How Reddit gets hundreds of celebrities per year to host AMAs. By promising tens of millions of eyes.  An audience of 60,000 is valuable to a company the size of M1. But to a company like Vanguard. 60,000 is barley worth a sixty second spot for a PR intern.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. I have been reaching out, and there are individuals willing to host AMAs with our community. All I am saying, is that the larger r/dividends becomes, the more high profile our guests. So if you want to see warren buffet on here before he eventually passes away, we need more members.\r\n\r\nI currently am speaking with two companies about their CEOs hosting AMAs. One is publicly traded. I'm not going to reveal who in case it doesn't work out, but I am taking suggestions. As many as this subreddit can physically give me. \r\n\r\nThe CEO of any company. No matter how big or small. No matter the country.  Youtubers, executives, media personalities, etc. If it relates to dividends or investing in general, fair game. Brokerages?

So when it comes to financial markets I have built up a great deal of knowledge ( within the speculative side ). So as I continue to read about advice for young investors the majority of responses consist of not focusing on dividends, but focusing on growth stock opportunities. Which makes perfectly good sense. That being said , most young investors I've noticed don't actively trade 2 other riskier/ quicker return % instruments that produce returns similar to what growth investing would. With all of that being said . In my current situation of having to accounts that are actively being traded with riskier higher returning instruments . Would it be more beneficial for me to focus on Dividends and not so much growth due to the high level of risk already associated with my other 2 accounts? The idea of creating a dividend portfolio for passive income to intrigue me a good bit , but at the same time I'm also after the wealth.

{"name": "t3_kmlgfs", "title": "Brief Guide to Evaluating Bank Stocks", "text": "Lots of people avoid investing in banks because they are hard to evaluate, their balance sheets can be opaque, and they are a heavily regulated industry. \r\n\r\nHowever, banks are also a core part of the economy, and many pay some nice, steady dividends.\r\n\r\nThe core business of a bank, taking in deposits and then lending them out at a higher rate to create “net interest margin” (NIM) is naturally profitable and that business model isn’t going anywhere.\r\n\r\nHere's a broad overview to make choosing bank stocks a bit easier!\r\n\r\n### Types of Banks\r\n\r\n**Mega-Banks**: JPM, C, BAC, WFC, GS\r\n\r\nWith fingers in all sorts of investment pies, these huge banks offer many services – investment banking, wealth management, and loans (smaller part of their revenue than most). They may also have all sorts of crazy derivatives on the books, making their valuations difficult to judge, and in my opinion, riskier than people give credit for. \r\n\r\nJPM usually considered best managed, C or WFC if you like comeback stories.\r\n\r\n**Custody Banks**: STT, BK\r\n\r\nThese two banks hold investment assets for institutional managers, hedge funds, etc and split this huge pie of assets roughly equally. An incredibly stable business model, but growth is modest. \r\n\r\nState Street (STT) runs famous ETFs such as SPY, while BNY Mellon (BK) owns Pershing, which serves RIAs and other investment advisors, a possible source of revenue growth. (I rarely see these custody banks discussed, and I think they're underrated)\r\n\r\n**Regional US Banks**: USB, MTB (my two favorites, there are others as well).\r\n\r\nRegional banks are moderately large and geographically diversified, but have less strict capital requirements that the mega-banks must uphold (bank regulation is a deep rabbit hole to jump down, much too big to cover here).\r\n\r\nUSBank is best-of-breed here in my opinion, with top-notch management, efficient operations, as well as a payments-processing business with a moat. There are other competitors in this space (FITB, KEY) which you can investigate to see if they appear to be a bargain relative to the excellence of USB.\r\n\r\n**Canadian Banks**: RY, TD, BNS…\r\n\r\nThere are five (I think) dominant banks in Canada. They pay nice dividends. Many have wide international reach – Scotiabank (BNS) is deep in Latin America, for example – which is a differentiating feature among them. \r\n\r\nLiving in the US I don’t want to hassle with Canadian tax withholding on my dividends, so I don’t own these, but otherwise they could be attractive.\r\n\r\n**Community Banks**. For a nice list, see holdings of the ETF QABA.\r\n\r\nThese are interesting – micro-caps, typically with between 30-50 branches in a locality. Their success will largely depend on the region they operate in – think of them like a super-regional, mini-ETF because they survive and thrive by giving loans to local small businesses. \r\n\r\nMost of their revenue comes from loan spreads, so more interest rate sensitive – but they also are less heavily regulated, allowing for (sometimes) better profit margins than their larger cousins. \r\n\r\nRecently PPP gave a massive cash infusion to community banks, and while that program has ended, it’s been good for balance sheets.\r\n\r\nLots of due diligence needed, as the efficiency and operations of these vary bigly, and you’ll want to evaluate them closely before investing. \r\n\r\nMy favorites: STXB (Houston-Texas, rapidly growing), NTB (Bahamas and Cayman Islands, good dividend). \r\n\r\n### Evaluating Bank Stocks – Important Ratios\r\n\r\nThe balance sheet for a bank is different from non-financial stocks, so ratios you may normally use can be useless or totally misleading. (Particularly, ROIC is meaningless).\r\n\r\nHere are some that can be useful:\r\n\r\n**Price/Book**: basically how expensive a bank’s stock is (more meaningful than P/E). P/B between 1-2 is normal, P/B < 1 usually means either problems on the balance sheet, or a bargain.\r\n\r\n**ROE**: Return on Equity, obviously higher is better. How effectively a bank uses your investment dollar to generate profits. With interest rates being low, banks that have more tangential businesses (e.g. wealth management) do better on this metric than others.\r\n\r\nA bank can show higher ROE if it is highly levered, has a lot of debt on the books, this is not desirable way to boost ROE…\r\n\r\n**Dividend Payout Ratio**: how much of a bank’s earnings go out to pay dividends. If this is > 75%, concerning. Also check history of dividend increases in the past - some banks have dividend growth rates of ~10%, very attractive for long term dividend investors.\r\n\r\n**Net Interest Margin**: how profitable the bank’s loan operations are, the spread between what they pay on deposits and what they charge on loans. A small bank might have NIM > 4, large banks might have closer to 2.5 as they are forced to compete more on rates. Higher NIM means their profits are more stable (arguably, it indicates a moat).\r\n\r\n**Non Performing Assets**: the percentage of loans that are in trouble. An indicator of how good the bank is at underwriting for risks – if this figure is increasing over time, beware! Generally a well-run bank will have < 0.5% of non-performing loans when the economy is doing well. If > 1.0%, beware.\r\n\r\n**Where do you find all these ratios?** I use Schwab for my brokerage, which gives access to **CFRA**’s quantitative reports – I think they do a good job on covering banks.\r\n\r\nThis is all the easily accessible stuff, if you want a deeper look into the balance sheet of a bank and so on, “The Bank Investor's Handbook” Nathan Tobik and Kenneth J. Yellen will walk you through that.\r\n\r\n### Hope someone finds this helpful.", "score": 166, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "created_utc": 1609271413.0, "tickers": [["NIM", 2], ["C", 1], ["WFC", 1], ["BNY", 1], ["MTB", 1], ["STXB", 1], ["NTB", 1], ["ROIC", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_km5j3p", "title": "Why I chose QYLD and similar ETFs and defied traditional FIRE investment norm", "text": "I started seeing so many misinformed posts about QYLD and dividend investing in generals so this is my replies and my justifications for choosing QYLD and similar ETFs and hope it helps people who are on the fence looking for some directions on how to proceed. Don't really care about what naysayers were saying since I have been doing growth investing for a long time but only started to switch recently. \r\n\r\nThe amount of misinformation and FUD spread on this subreddit could be daunting and I am still not sure why some people who are so against dividends are even here ? Maybe feeling insecure about their investment choices and need to shit on people on the other side of the fence to feel better about themselves ?\r\n\r\nHere are the reasons I chose QYLD and other similar investment options:\r\n\r\n* I care about cash flow rather than some growth magic. There was a period where SP 500 didn't grow at all from 2000 - 2013. Growth is speculative and those stocks are only worth as much as the next people who are willing to pay for it. The values are not realized until you sell. \r\n* Tax is a fact of life. Scared of tax ? May as well stop working, stop changing jobs to get pay raise, stop working hard to get promotion, bonus, etc... Tax gonna get you anyway, why bother ??? The point here is learn to live with tax. You can minimize it but not completely eliminate it. And I plan to move to income-tax free states in the future anyway so I will only pay federal income tax, not state income tax. \r\n* Some of the returns from covered call ETFs like QYLD or NUSI are classified as return-of-capital. It will reduce your cost basis but are tax-free until you sell your shares which I never plan to do\r\n* QYLD utilizes a tax straddle strategy that makes it very efficient for tax vs. trading your own options. Read this up: [https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/Global-X-Covered-Call-ETF-Tax-Primer.pdf](https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/Global-X-Covered-Call-ETF-Tax-Primer.pdf) and be ready to be mind-blown. \r\n* QYLD and similar kinds like JEPI, NUSI are a good hedge against flat & down market. You need it as part of a balanced portfolio. Growth is not indefinitely, stocks will pull back. When it pulls back 30% what will you do ? Eating rice and bean rather than selling stocks at their bottom to meet your income need ? QYLD has been proven through multiple crashes to provide consistent income with consistent range that even some dividend etfs or companies couldn't do.\r\n* The guy who invented 4% rule that FIRE people follow like Bible only studied for 30 years period and the guy apparently doesn't know what he's doing. He made recent comment about increasing the WR to 5% during the period where stocks are the most volatile in history and PE is to the moon. Lots of experienced fund managers have warned about a potential flat market in the next 10 years due to PE ratio right now in the unbelievable territory\r\n* I do have growth vehicle: SCHD, VINIX (SP500), IHDG so I am not worried about growth. I only buy QYLD + JEPI + NUSI enough to meet my income need for FIRE then I start buying only growth or dividend growth etfs, no need to keep buying QYLD after I have sufficient income\r\n* Financial security: you will never know when you lose your jobs, when you can't work anymore, etc.. Having focused on income etfs first and keep doing that till it meets your income needs will give you a mental safety net that you could have never imagined. Try switching your investment and have that 5k checks coming every month. You won't give a fuck about your work, your boss, COVID, etc... I guarantee it. \r\n* QYLD does have its driving force for growth. Selling ATM calls against NASDAQ will get you \\~3% per month, QYLD gives you back 1% and the 2% the fund managers will use it to ensure the funds doesn't collapse. QYLD will match NASDAQ returns if NASDAQ only increase at most 2% a month but it will miss the rest of the growth minus 2% monthly if NASDAQ increases beyond 2% such as after a crash, which explains why QYLD recovers much slower. Hence, comparing QYLD vs. NASDAQ is like comparing Apple to Orange, same underlying investments but different return-generating strategy. QYLD recovers much slower in the event of a crash but you can be sure that it will never go to zero unless NASDAQ crashes more often than it grows (which is not possible). However, if you are worried about stagnant values, you can choose funds like JEPI and NUSI which writes out of the money cover calls for lesser income but it comes with some growth prospect. On top of that they are all actively managed so fund managers can intervene and close calls early to make sure you don't miss the growth opportunity.\r\n\r\nSo my final advice for fellow dividend investors and like-minded FIRE people is that do your own researches and make your own decisions. Lots of herd mentality here and make sure you choose whatever makes you comfortable with.", "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "created_utc": 1609210687.0, "tickers": [["SP", 1]]}
{"name": "t3_km3lo8", "title": "The Power of High Dividend Growth Rates", "text": "I know AT&T and dividend yield vs dividend growth get brought up a lot on here, but I think it's important to reiterate the following idea, especially for newer investors. Let's do a quick comparison between 2 stocks that have performed very differently over the past 10 years: AT&T (T) and Home Depot (HD). For this example we'll only look at dividends collected, not total return (although HD's total return was enormous due to stock performance). We'll compare from both a DRIP perspective and simply collecting the dividends to spend or reallocate elsewhere. All examples will use a $10,000 starting investment.\r\n\r\n### Dividends paid out over 10 years **without** DRIP:\r\n\r\n| Comparison      | HD       | T       |\r\n|---------------------|----------|---------|\r\n| Div/share 2011        | $0.94    | $1.73   |\r\n| Div/share 2020        | $5.44    | $2.08   |\r\n| Annual Payout 2011  | $337     | $588    |\r\n| Annual Payout 2020  | $1,942   | $708    |\r\n| Tot Div over 10 yrs | $8,863   | $6,497  |\r\n\r\n### Dividends paid out over 10 years **with** DRIP:\r\n\r\n| Comparison          | HD       | T       |\r\n|---------------------|----------|---------|\r\n| Div/share 2011        | $0.94    | $1.73   |\r\n| Div/share 2020        | $5.44    | $2.08   |\r\n| Annual Payout 2011  | $343     | $610    |\r\n| Annual Payout 2020  | $2,414   | $1,194  |\r\n| Tot Div over 10 yrs | $10,350  | $8,720  |\r\n\r\n### Dividend Growth Rate Comparison\r\n\r\n| Dividend Growth Rate | HD       | T      |\r\n|----------------------|----------|---------|\r\n| 10 Year CAGR    | 19.71%   | 2.21%  |\r\n| 5 Year CAGR      | 23.68%   | 2.09%  |\r\n| 3 Year CAGR      | 25.38%   | 2.04%  |\r\n\r\nNote that HD's forward dividend was also increased to $6.00 and T's is still $2.08.\r\n\r\nHD isn't the only stock highlighting the powerful effects of a high dividend growth rate. A quick glance without factoring in DRIP also shows Broadcom (AVGO) paying $16,616 over the past 10 years and AbbVie (ABBV) paying $6,876 over only 8 years. All of these companies (HD, AVGO, ABBV) have also beat the overall market in terms of growth during those times. In many cases these high dividend growth stocks will pay more than high yielders once you hold for long enough. \r\n\r\nThis post is just an example of why its important to take all factors into consideration when investing. It's a good idea to determine if you want/need the dividend income now or later, as your choice can have a big impact on your future compounding. Someone retired/retiring soon may still opt for T since they don't have the time to wait for a stock like HD to catch up.\r\n\r\n*All data taken from FastGraphs and Seeking Alpha*\r\n\r\nBETTER LATE THAN NEVER EDIT: This post isn't saying to buy HD, its showing the contrast in performance between high and low dividend growth over a decade.

{"name": "t3_kn6u45", "title": "Realty Income $O - A stock guide/review", "text": "# Introduction:\r\n\r\nGood morning and Happy Holidays everyone. Thanks for the patience regarding this post, holidays have been a bit busy for us. For this review, I will be diving less in the financials since REITs are required to pay out 90% of it's income in the form of distributions, and since it is important to evaluate them based on their holdings rather than strict numbers. Especially when fluctuations in the Real Estate market are taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nPlease note, I will not be discussing individual holdings, there are way too many to evaluate there, however I am going to link the investor presentation and 10K below. If you do anything with this post, please make it that, check out those slides, they are loaded with very useful company information that would take way too long to discuss here. Plus they have better visuals. Because I am including those links this post will be shorter than my normal ones simple because there is too much information to include in a single post that is better represented in the information they already have.\r\n\r\n# $O - Realty Income:\r\n\r\n**Sector: Real Estate Investment Trust - REIT**\r\n\r\nRealty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company, is an S&P 500 company dedicated to providing stockholders with dependable monthly income. The company is structured as a REIT, and its monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from over 6,500 real estate properties owned under long-term lease agreements with commercial tenants. To date, the company has declared 604 consecutive common stock monthly dividends throughout its 51-year operating history and increased the dividend 108 times since Realty Income's public listing in 1994 (NYSE: O). The company is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index..\r\n\r\n**Strengths:**\r\n\r\n>\\- Very strong tangible assets. We will look a list of tenants below.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Popularity amoung investors due to monthly payouts and increasing dividends. Dividends they managed to continuously increase through the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Conservative and responsible spending/expansion planning.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Diversified tenants w/long leases.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Occupancy has never been below \\~95%  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- 23 out of 24 years of earnings growth. (2008 was the one negative year, and only bt \\~-2%)\r\n\r\n**Negatives:**\r\n\r\n>\\- Dividends will be taxes at your ordinary income tax rate since they are non-qualified dividends.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- More susceptible to rising mortgage interest rates.  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Expensive compared to similar REITs. (due to popularity).  \r\n>  \r\n>\\- Long term health/staying of traditional brick and mortar retail locations vs companies like Amazon.\r\n\r\n**Top 20 Tenants:**\r\n\r\nMany of $O's tenants are big names. As it stands, Realty Income has over \\~600 tenants across 51 separate industries in both the United States and UK. Since 1990, it has grow from  630 properties to over 6,588 properties in 2020.\r\n\r\n* Walgreens\\* 5.8%\r\n* 7-Eleven\\* 4.9%\r\n* Dollar General\\* 4.4%\r\n* FedEx\\* 3.8%\r\n* Dollar Tree / Family Dollar\\* 3.3%\r\n* LA Fitness 3.3%\r\n* Regal Cinemas (Cineworld) 2.8%\r\n* AMC Theatres 2.7%\r\n* Sainsbury’s 2.6%\r\n* Walmart / Sam’s Club\\* 2.6%\r\n* Life Time Fitness 2.5%\r\n* Circle K (Couche-Tard)\\* 1.8%\r\n* BJ’s Wholesale Clubs 1.7%\r\n* Treasury Wine Estates 1.6%\r\n* CVS Pharmacy\\* 1.6%\r\n* Super America (Marathon)\\*\r\n* 1.6% Kroger\\* 1.5%\r\n* Home Depot\\* 1.4%\r\n* GPM Investments / Fas Mart 1.4%\r\n* TBC Corporation\\* 1.2%\r\n\r\nSo what was the impact of COVID-19? Surprisingly very small. Over 94% of Realty Income's tenants continued to pay their rents on time and in full. The 6% that were not able to continue paying include:\r\n\r\n* 60% of Theaters (\\*cough\\* AMC)\r\n* 18% of Health and Fitness Gyms\r\n* 3% of General Merchandise Retailors\r\n* 1% of Casual Dining Restaurants\r\n\r\n# Dividend & Growth Highlights:\r\n\r\nThe numbers we will be looking at here are the dividend and company growth since 1994. Remember that these numbers are not indicative of future growth since they are backwards looking. No one has a crystal ball telling them how companies will grow in the future.\r\n\r\n**Current Dividend Info:**\r\n\r\n|Stock Price|$61.25|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|P/E Ratio|51.00 (They are popular)|\r\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.81|\r\n|Monthly Dividend Amount|$0.2340|\r\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|4.7%|\r\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|4.3%|\r\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3%|\r\n\r\n**Interesting Growth/Dividend Highlights since 1994:**\r\n\r\n* Compound annual return of 15.3%\r\n* Compound annual dividend growth of \\~4.45%\r\n* Dividend Growth of 212.5% (Including Dec 2020)\r\n* Market Cap vs Debt = $21.3 Billion vs. $8.5 Billion\r\n\r\n**What if you bought back in 2009?:**\r\n\r\nSuppose you bought 1000 shares back in 2009 after the subprime crisis, what would you investment and income look like now? Well:\r\n\r\n|1K Shares Bought on Dec 2009|$25,900|\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n|Investment Value as of Dec 2020|$61,250|\r\n|Dividend Income in 2009|\\~$1,700|\r\n|Dividend Income in 2020|\\~2,800 (Assuming DRIP)|\r\n|Original Yield in 2009|\\~6.5%|\r\n|Yield as of 2020 (Assuming DRIP)|\\~10.5%|\r\n|Dividends Received from 2009 - 2020|\\~$24,000 (Assuming DRIP)|\r\n\r\nSo, without even considering the stock price appreciation, dividends would have returned you nearly your entire original investment amount of $25K. Again, all these number do assume you were reinvesting the dividends to compound your growth.\r\n\r\n# Link to the Investor and International Expansion Slides:\r\n\r\n[REALTY INCOME INVESTOR PRESENTATIONS](https://www.realtyincome.com/investors/investor-presentation/default.aspx)\r\n\r\nHere you can find slides that present the current company finance structure, outlook, levels of debt, and tenant information all visualized in a very good way. It is too much information to write about here so please take the time to check it out if you are more interested in those details. Much of this information starts on slide 31. Additionally the information can be found on page 34 of the annual 10K.\r\n\r\n[REALTY INCOME 10K ANNUAL FILING](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000726728/d57a0155-979b-4fe7-a169-1a9306bf58e5.pdf)\r\n\r\nHere in the 10K is all the detailed information about their ownings, ownings by state, individualized income from those holdings, mortgage debt, revolving debt numbers, total income and investments, and payout dispersals.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Many of the numbers are can fluctuate wildly due to swings in the intrinsic value of their properties and the overall real estate market, this can make REITs a bit harder to evaluate strictly from a numbers perspective.\r\n\r\n# A quick note about the 10K:\r\n\r\nIt is strongly encouraged you scroll through the 10K when you have time to relax and if you're interested in investing into the company. (Link right above in previous section)\r\n\r\nAt a glance on page 34, it can be noted that they have steadily been increasing their profit margins over the last 5 years. Yes Debt has increased, but so has the overall revenue, and at a slightly wider margin than debt expansion. This is part of their strategy moving forward and is discussed in the investor presentation on slide 35+ in the link above.\r\n\r\n# Closing Thoughts:\r\n\r\nRealty Income is popular is a REIT for a reason, it has excellent holdings, pays monthly, has strong staying power even during market down turns (2008 + COVID), and competent leadership with responsible, relevant, and more conservative investment strategies. (This is particularly important during downturns, see AMC vs Cinemark right now)\r\n\r\nAgain, please check out the 10K and Investor Slides above, there is much more useful information there that would simply take too long to cover here. This was a shorter post to simply get the brain juices churning before reading the information from the links.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for the patience for this post, thankyou for reason, please do your own research, and everyone have a fantastic rest of their holidays. Happy (soon to be) New Year!\r\n\r\nEdit: I am highlighting this comment by u/methothimself for anyone looking into the 10k. REIT valuations are generally measured on a Price/FFO, Price/AFFO and Premium/Discount to NAV, which is why the P/E looks so distorted for most REITs as it accounts for a heavy depreciation line item. FFO adds back depreciation and AFFO adds back depreciation and recurring capex.

I started with some somewhat popular ones (T and KSS to name a couple).  Anyways as some of you may know KSS cut their dividend earlier this year but since I'm new and want to show some conviction for my choices I decided to hold long and probably still will but before I do I want more input. So while KSS dropped the dividend its been steadily rising in price with whispers of the div coming back sometime 1st-2nd quarter of 2021. I bought 18shares @17.70 back in March and now its currently trading @ 40ish. My question is is if I should sell for a profit considering I'm currently not receiving dividends for the stock and the amount of dividends id receive from a full year of owning it wouldn't even be close to as much as I'd make from selling right now?  I'm not sure if holding is always the best answer or if the profit outweighs the longevity of holding the stock in this situation?

{"name": "t3_knm6nm", "title": "Portfolio Advice", "text": "Dividend team, good evening and happy new year! I hope everyone else is looking forward to increasing their passive income in 2021. \r\n\r\nTo state this as concisely as possible, I am looking to increase my passive income. I do have a Roth IRA (mutual funds, actively managed, mostly growth, but some dividends) and also a 401k (target date fund) that I contribute the company match. \r\n\r\nAnything extra that I can afford to invest goes in to my dividend portfolio. This is not money that I will need for retirement as it is likely in addition to the two retirement accounts I will also receive a decent sized inheritance. I am not banking on it but it is likely. Due to my other investments and what I stated above I am a LITTLE bit on the riskier side with my dividend portfolio. In short, I would rather have less money now than have more money later for this account specifically... if that makes sense. Not investing for maximum return in the long run. I am investing for passive income now. I reinvest most of it but every once in a while plan to pull for trips or other fun parts of life. I do chase yield a little bit but I try to balance it out with dividend + growth stocks and dividend growth stocks. I have created a dividend portfolio that reaches across all 11 of the major sectors of the market. Most of the companies are blue chip and have a history of dividend growth. Most have high yield with a few low yield growers. A few pure growth stocks as well (hospitality companies I believe will rebound big time). Obviously this will all be taxed, but I am OK with that. And although pure growth stocks may be statistically more probable to perform at my age (27) I prefer the dividend approach for the passive income.\r\n\r\nBelow is the portfolio I have created. Please share honest feedback on things I’m missing or might want to change. I realize this is a lot of companies to keep tabs on. For me, this is “buy and hold forever”. I don’t plan to actively manage these positions. Once I buy I plan to keep it except for in rare circumstances. \r\n\r\nCurrently I hold about 10 if these companies with about $30k invested and $2000 annual yield. I started investing in September. Wish I would have started way sooner. \r\n\r\nThank you!
