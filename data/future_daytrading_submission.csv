t3_33sp5y,Guide To Daytrading (With Links),"**Daytrade momentum specific intro:**
-
I short intraday. It is (in my opinion) the most fun style of trading. If i were you i would stay away from pennystocks until you have a good understanding of stockpromotion and short squeezes. If you want to do well in daytrading you should record each trade and write down where you want to get out of a stock (pretty much a mental stoploss).
Shorting intraday is not easy, you have to adapt and be ready to understand when to get into and out of a stock. Here is trade I made a few months back: http://i.imgur.com/aMU43pI.png?1 As you can see, I had gotten in with a set idea when I wanted to get out. I shorted because I felt the momentum has shifted and I looked for a opportunity to get in. This is in my opinion the most important aspect in a daytrader, having a plan.

**Research tools:**

http://finviz.com/screener.ashx

http://finance.yahoo.com/

https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/gainers?e=US

http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/markets/screener.asp

http://busystock.com/earnings-calendar/

And if i want to look for stock promotions to short:

http://stockreads.com/

http://stockpromoters.com/


**Brokers:**

* Interactive Brokers - great shorting list but has a lot of limitations such as starting with 10k.

* Etrade- decent short list, also has a lot of restrictions but you can start with less money and has a decent short list

* suretrader - bypasses pdt rule, has a good short list, but its platform blows. You would need to get das trader pro

* Center point- best broker for shorts but it costs a lot to start out, not a beginning broker

* robinhood- if you have literally no money and need to avoid commissions


**Platforms:**

* Das trader pro- my favorite but costs $50 a month, it is a nice platform

* thinkorswim- free platform and does the job just fine. Not as nice as das trader

* etrade pro- I have never used it but it seems like a cleaner version of tos

**And the scan i use (the basic version):** http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=311&f=sh_curvol_o50,sh_price_u15,ta_highlow20d_nh,ta_perf2_d5o&ta=0&o=-volume , your choice to use it or not. Lots of traders would say ""ew those stocks suck"", i get the ones with the best setup to short. 


**Quick tip:**
When you start out, do not go in and immediatly trade. Paper trade first and record your trades, (don't lie about ur trades either, record the truth). Obvious learn all you can by reading books. Once you feel like you have a good understanding of daytrading then go ahead and try it with real money. Each trade you should get in with an idea where to cut losses and collect gains

Try to avoid doing the following when daytrading:
-

* You have no trading plan

* **You are blindly following others because they are experts** 

* No clue how to set a proper r/r

* ""Hope"" is part of your ""strategy""

* You average down on losers 

* You jump from one hot trading method to another hoping for ""the answer""

* Ask for stock picks

t3_350d7o,Big trades from today - and watches going into tomorrow,"Hey guys - TSXtrad3r back with some more trade ideas and recaps. Nailed some big ones today, namely $PTDI. 

My initial entry at $5.01 was only 1/3 of my total size, keeping risk low, planned to take it off for a small loss if $4.90s broke again. I added a little more through $5.10 and then finally the rest through $5.20, at which point I was positive this would squeeze through $5.30 as shorts were starting to panic cover. I dont know what it was, just experience I guess, but I have never been so sure a squeeze was going to happen in my life. I bet big, it ripped and kept on ripping all the way to $7.50++. It was a seriously impressive move, and I sold a bit too early again, but the biggest win for me was seeing the signs of a squeeze, anticipating it before it happened, and getting long at a low avg price with LOW risk relative to reward on the trade and totally nailing the entry.

Heres everything from today and a little bit about my trading journey outlined here in my new blog!

I am not afraid of the challenge of learning but I would greatly appreciate any useable advise that will put me on the right track.

I appreciate the above is vague so I have some questions below that I believe I need answering before I can even consider starting:

1. What is a good starting capital? I will be working in Â£'s but if you are working in another currency please just use your own.
2. What software would you recommend for tracking trades?
3. Is there a good guide for reading the charts? I can google this but if you have a good one please do let me know
4. What is a good market to start on? I know there is potential for lots of different answer here so please feel free to offer opinions
5. How would you structure a day of trading?
5.1. What stocks are you looking at?
5.2. How to find stock that my be profitable? The key question I know but what I mean is, where do I even start? where do I research? do I need to research a company? Can I just draw conclusions from the charts?
6. Are there any noob mistakes I should be aware of?

I will be paper trading until I have built up some capital. Is there anything I should be aware of when doing this, I want to keep it as a true reflection of trading.

t3_454knx,Zero Commission Broker - Trade Zero,"I've been eyeing Trade Zero for a while now as a broker option. At first I was thinking theres no way this could be real, and I was very sceptical, but after doing a lot of research on them, speaking time and time again with their upper management, opening an account AND trading with several others who are using them, I've come to the conclusion that this is a great option for people looking to get away from greedy broker fees and actually KEEP more of your trading profits. 

The way it works is if you add liquidity to the market in a trade, its FREE (they use EDGE X route to get a credit, but its free for your trade). If you remove liquidity, it costs 0.005/share.. For example, if I bid for 2000 shares of stock ABCD at $2 and get filled on the bid, and then offer the 2000 shares at $2.10 and get filled later, that trade is FREE and a $200 profit is made. Now lets say that instead of offering at $2.10 (adding liquidity), you remove the bid at $2.10 it would cost you $10 for the removing 2k shares and your profit would be $190 net. 

This is VERY competitive when comparing to similar brokers, and so far they have been great as far as customer service and their commission structure is working exactly as promised. 

Unfortunately, they do not service US clients, but anywhere else in the world you can use them. Im open for discussion if you have any questions about this broker, I can probably answer it for you, or direct you to the company director who can.

t3_46c010,"Now that last month's oil contract has come and gone, here is where the top is likely going to be","So on 2/7 a few trader friends and I worked to locate the bottom of oil [here](http://i.imgur.com/YgdK5r3.png) that came on 2/11. The turnaround was 26.20 and was determined by an oversold condition and patterns in the OVX showing instability and exhaustion projections in the downtrend. I can explain further for anyone interested, just post a comment below.

We also used the same methods to locate the turnaround in the SPX by analyzing the VIX and other key indicators here. [Don't laugh at the MS Paint drawing](http://i.imgur.com/M2gBV4r.png)

The reason for the downtrend is that we are in a bear market, and the reason for the temporary turnaround was a weakening in open interest on puts and a stall on the down trend, not to mention both CL and the SPX bouncing off of key support levels. 

There will certainly be more downward moves, but not for a bit. Things need to trade up first before shorting becomes less risky. The obvious tops to each will be as follows at minimum trading to resistance before a full reversal down for both the SPX [here](http://imgur.com/ZJWusQe) and the CL [here](http://imgur.com/ahv7hzM) 

It will first require a stall at those areas and a refusal to trade higher, of which we will see a sudden and drastic turnaround as quickly as we saw last week to the upside.

For those of you new to trading post-2008, this is what the start of a normal bear market looks like. If you need a point of reference start out at the ""Climb of 99"" and then the 2000-2003 bear market that followed. We are matching similar trading and fear patterns in the markets.

The reasoning for a bear market is obvious, there is a looming credit crisis where corporate debt is becoming overwhelmingly bad. Oil prices plunging to newer lows causing so many E&P's and majors to take major credit downgrades. There is also a rush to bonds with yields at all time lows. 

Folks, don't let this bump up get your hopes for a bullish turnaround for the long hall. This is going to be short lived until fundamentals change. You usually see cycling like this on the way down, 2-3 very long cycles taking months to play out, and then the bear market usually ends with a final plunge. 

My estimates for this would be a year out at least, and SPX near the 1600's. Unless something changes, brace for a long 2-3 bearish years. But in the meantime, long the hell out of oil until J6 contract taps 36.88. 

The reason oil is trading up, despite what anyone tells you, trust traders who are in it every day. It's only trading up because the same algo's covering shorts on the other 93% of the SPX is covering oil shorts as low bond yields force money to move over into equities. And with an oversold oil condition and a massive liquidation of DWTI a few weeks back, the bounce was inevitable. Because shorts just cover if things stop falling. Nothing falls straight down. And if SPX fully corrects to the 2035 level, give or take 10-15 pts, oil will hit that 36.88 with ease. If there is a hang up there, I can see a 42.68 overshoot before shorting will resume.

Remember with oil that shorting will resume unless fundamentals in oil will change. And that doesn't look like that's happening. So we're back to the same ol' yearly cycling based on summer-winter-summer demand shifts.

Happy Trading you guys!

t3_4snlc5,My (Meager) Daytrading Experience & What I've Learned,"New trader here (not technically daytrader yet) hoping to share what I've learned with fellow noobies and perhaps get some good feedback from the pros on here.

I just started trading last April with 6k in a margin account with $7 commission, held some long trades, made a couple hundred then sat tight for a while because I was in the process of buying a house. I started up again mid-June with 8k and I just hit 10k last week (4 weeks of trading). I only have three trades per week until I can build up to 25k and upgrade to a daytrading account but I have done rather well so far pulling in around 4% in realized gains each week. 

My point is it is definitely possible to make 1% most if not every day (as long as you have the 25k for daytrading.) I aim for 1-2% on each trade I make (whether going long or short). Is it easy? Not necessarily. But it's made easier by always remaining calm and collected and following a set of personal rules for trading. It's also made easier if you can afford to watch your positions from open to close. When I started, I would let my positions go overnight but after a couple of scary trades I realized that the chance of the stock opening and being favorable for me did not offset the risk of the opposite. Often a stock will open at dollars or cents above or below the previous day's close.

Since then, I try not to hold positions overnight. To help this goal, I do not enter into trades within 3 hours of stock market close.

Also, I only trade about 4-6 hours per week (with only three weekly trades it doesn't take long).

You should also know that I did almost a year of watching stocks and researching stock trading before I started - I also had the luxury of being able to occasionally watch my friend/mentor do daytrading and was able to pick his brain. I like to think I am headed towards a very lucrative future but I try to stay in the moment so I don't trip up on the market. The market is unforgiving and one mistake could cost you a huge chunk of your capital - it will just as soon fill your wallet as it will turn around and mug you for everything you got. The key is to have a healthy respect for what the market can and can't do and to not get too greedy nor too frustrated. Before you make a trade, analyze why you think it is a good trade and pick a minimum mark that you think is very achievable (Usually 1% for me). Set up a stop loss so  if the market breaks negative for you, you can get out with minimal loss. It is also a good idea to set a sell limit at your minimal mark so you can lock in your gains automatically when it hits the mark. If you dont mind the extra commission, you can lock in half your gains and let it ride further into profit if that looks to be likely. Also - don't be afraid to get out of your trade if you dont think it will meet your minimal market. Remember - any gain at all is better than a loss. A small gain means better gains in the future (assuming you reinvest gains). And if you bail out early and it ends up hitting your mark, dont beat yourself up. You played it safe and it can be taken as a valuable learning experience.

Another personal rule and this one is important - NEVER EVER take stock picks from anyone, not me, not Warren Buffet, not your mom, ect. As soon as you take a stock pick and it does poorly you just lost money because you didn't value your money enough to take personal responsibility for its well being. Put in the time, learn to recognize patterns and things like RSI and make your own stock picks. That way, if you fail you have only yourself to blame and if you succeed, it gives you the confidence to keep going and keep improving. Taking a stock pick is trusting that the source is both extremely intelligent, extremely experienced at stock forecasting, and extremely altruistic. How many people do you know that fit that bill? 

Also, watch the volume and relative strength indicator - they are valuable indicators of what is going on. Don't just buy into a stock because it just jumped up. If it just jumped up, it is more likely to fall back at least a bit rather than keep going up.

I am an amateur. Not a complete idiot as I know some of the basic (of the lowest level) and lingos you guys speak. Because I can't do actual daytrading (lack the 25k) I was thinking about doing swing/option trading.

t3_5ch3vj,TD Investing screwed My Trade Over. AVOID!!,"TD Direct Investing sometimes randomly have a person from their ""Risk Department"" to manually ""review"" the low-cap/nano-cap stocks that you want to purchase before they approve your order of getting filled. Their review process can take anywhere between 1-3 minutes then your order gets filled at a random time after they hit their ""approve"" button. By that time wasted, the price of your stock would have changed significantly. I lost $100 this morning because when I tried to sell one of my stocks, their review process wasted a lot of time. Consequently, my stock price have dropped and the order got filled a few minutes after. 

I haven't had this happen to me until the last couple of days of trading with them. I spoke to a person from the TD Risk Department and this is supposedly a common step that they must go through for low-cap stocks (he spoke very rudely as well). They actually have a huge watchlist of stocks that they don't allow their clients to buy (I wasn't allowed to get info on what kind stocks they were and what kind of information they usually look at but was only told about it).

t3_5g4jq5,Beginners start here,"Hey everyone. A while back I made the decision to moderate this subreddit because I was once in your shoes. I honestly did not know where to begin. I would type in âdaytradingâ in google and come up with so many companies trying to sell me the dream. âMake $$$ while you sleep!â âLook at how much I made today!!â etc.  I wanted to make this post to first give new people a place where to start and to even offer some resources that can get you started in the right direction. If I have anything else to add I will add it here. 


1.	Open up a papertrading account with Think or Swim. It is free and you can get live data just by requesting it from support. All you have to do is ask them to add live data to your papertrading account. Do not pay monthly for any papertrading account. There are a lot of free videos out there that can help you get started with Think or Swim. The program looks complicated at first but it is very powerful. I spent a few days with the program and at the end of the week I was fairly comfortable with understanding where everything was. I have never had a 60-day limit with my papertrading account by the way. 
https://www.thinkorswim.com/t/pm-registration.html 
Start here and start taking trades! It is all fake money and will give you some insight into how the program works as well as how the markets move. 

One other tip for setting up your papertrading account is to only set it up with a reasonable amount of money. I know a lot of papertrading accounts give you 100k right off the bat but realistically, how many of us are going to have that much money to start out with? Set it to something more reasonable like 10-20k if you are trading forex (or even less if all you have is 1-5k to trade with) or 25k+ if you are going to daytrade stocks only because the regulations require you to have at least 25k in your account at all times to daytrade (In this case, I would probably give yourself 30k just to be safe). 

If you are looking for a stock screener, ThinkorSwim has a pretty good one. A personal favorite of mine is www.FINVIZ.com which has an awesome screener for finding different chart patterns and conditions (such as prices crossing above 20 bar EMA, trending up, etc)

Think or Swim has stocks, forex, futures, and options. Options are an entirely different beast all together but stocks, forex, and futures are all ""yes-no"" type of trading while options give you a little more leeway with your mistakes. If you are interested in learning about options, message me and I can help guide you with the right direction and best resources I used to learn options. 

EDIT: Due to the amount of PM's I was getting, I have decided to post the options course I started with here https://www.udemy.com/learn-options-trading-courses/ You shouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for it as Udemy does a ton of sales throughout the year. You can also just do a ""Udemy coupon"" search on google and see what you pull up. Its about 10 hours worth of content and in my opinion it is worth every penny if you are wanting to learn more about options. There are a ton of other great classes on Udemy as well for learning just about anything. Just make sure to read the reviews!

Stocks is kind of the well known market for new comers but I would argue that Forex can also just as easily be traded by a newcomer. Also the benefit of trading Forex is that there is no commission off the bat. Most brokers will charge what is called a spread of some number of pips that you are essentially paying back. 

Futures trade in ticks and each tick nets you a gain of some amount or a loss of some amount so I do not suggest any new person to jump into futures until you understand the way markets work. Futures charge commission on each contract you buy or sell. It can be sort of related to Forex since a tick and a pip are essentially the same. 

The huge benefit to trading Futures and Forex is that there is NO pattern day trading rule. This means you can buy and sell as many times as you want without being flagged for not having 25k in your account.


2.	Tradimo is a great resource for getting your feet wet with technical analysis. It is free and shows you the ropes with how you can start looking at prices and charts: https://learn.tradimo.com/courses


3.	If there is ever a company you want to pay to help you learn, please do your research first. Type in the companyâs name along with âreviewâ at the end of your search and make your educated decision off of that. A lot of these companies have amazing advertising but will never teach you the right way to trade. A lot of them are scams too. I read that there was one trading system which the guy had the secrets of the âcode of tradingâ and only he knew the code but would sell it to you for hundreds of dollars. So many people come into trading with high expectations that if I just pay this company to teach me, I can be like them when in reality that may never happen. Always look at their testimonials with a grain of salt. Read the reviews just like you would on amazon for buying a product. I also like to type in the company's name and add ""scam"" at the end to see if I get any hits on that. Read the good reviews but also the bad to understand the bigger picture here. Very few will actually teach you how to trade. Also, Reddit is a great place to read up on things like this too. Just add ""Reddit"" at the end of your search and read up on other users reviews. 

Investimonials is also a good place to use as well (but do not use it as your only review source!!! Fake reviews are everywhere) http://www.investimonials.com
So before you drop that 1-2k on a course, make sure you do your homework. Don't be fooled by smooth advertising. 


4.	A high probability indicator or a holy grail strategy is not out there. If it was, everyone would be using it and making money. And if there does happen to be one, do you really think anyone will want to share it? The only way to get good at trading is to be able to read the charts and read where prices are going. This is through support and resistance and understanding channels. I cannot recommend Mackâs price action YouTube channel enough. https://www.youtube.com/user/PATsTrading 
I am a firm believer that price action is the basis for understanding price movement. Reading an indicator may help but you should not rely on solely indicators to guide you with trading as they may give you a signal to buy when you are at a major resistance level or sell when you are at a major support, both of which could burn you.


5. My only other advice is to look into markets that let you maximize profits. For some, it is not possible to buy 1000 shares of Apple. While trading low priced stocks lets you buy hundreds and maybe even thousands of shares at once, those stocks are too unpredictable because they can be influenced by individuals who do what is called a ""pump and dump"" schemes. Plus they can be difficult to read as far as what they are going to be doing next (going up or going down). My recommendation (and it is only my recommendation so only use this as guidance to make your own decision) would be to look into trading forex if you do not have a lot to start out with as some brokers (like FXCM) allow you to buy ""micro"" lots which let you invest as little as 100 dollars in some cases and have a much better chance of working in your favor due to the amount of people trading the same instrument. Note: There are some discussions about forex market makers adjusting the markets so you get stopped out prematurely. While I have not experienced this, it could theoretically happen? So if you do decide to trade Forex make sure you pick your broker carefully and again read the reviews! 

EDIT: I have read that what I mentioned above about Forex is outdated and the brokers are under stricter regulations. Do your own investigation and do not let what I said steer you away from trading forex if you really want to. The big Forex brokers you are able to open an account with in the US are FXCM, Oanda, and Forex.com. You have a lot more options if you are in another country.  

EDIT 2: Well it looks like FXCM may get banned from having clients in the US. Apparently they took some trades against their clients to profit on their end and have been using clients accounts to fund their extra expenses. Tread on your own risk. 


6. Above all, do not invest money that you are not willing to lose. I cannot emphasize this enough. Work on a simulator until you feel that your strategy works. This means putting in the time to sit down and analyze every trade you took which worked as well as the ones that didn't work. You need to go back over your mistakes and review why your trade did not work the way you thought it would. Was it because you bought at a high and sold at a low? Was it because you bought at a major resistance level thinking the stock would still go up? Was it because you were impulsive and entered in too early? Was it because you were too slow and entered in too late? This is the most important part about learning how to trade. Putting in the time and work to analyze what you did right and what you did wrong. You will never get better if you do not do this. 

7. Consider subscribing to a free daily financial newsletter such as The Morning Brew. Itâs a free subscription that is delivered Monday through Friday to your email before the markets open around 5-6 am central time. It summarizes the big financial topics of the morning in short easy to read sections that you can read over a cup of brew. 

I wouldnât say this is essential for daytrading but itâs nice to read if you are wanting to stay up to date on the financial markets as they will write about companies and stocks to look out for. Itâs also not spammy or filled with ads though there are one or two that are listed as âsponsoredâ. They donât typically put out a weekend read but instead send it M-F.

t3_5hl19o,"New (night?)-trader here, with a strategy theory that needs some honest critique","DISCLAIMER: Long post because if I only share parts of it, you're going to think I'm a veritable idiot. (also sorry if you've seen this elsewhere, I wasn't sure the best place to post)

I'm brand new to trading (like 3 days -- although I did use the 'best brokers' app for a while before I risked putting real money in the market). I have a ton of questions about things I'm learning, it's fascinating. But here's a strategy question I can't find online, and wanted some others opinions.

First, so we are all on the same page: I want to do day trading primarily. (not opposed to have 1-2 long term stock just harboring in the background, but I want something I can interact with and manipulate on a daily basis.) I also like that I can make a small profit in a short amount of time without having to keep my money in the market when I'm unable to monitor it. I know this is supposed to be riskier trading style, but I actually like the security of NOT keeping my money in a market I can't watch 24/7. I only really want it to be there when I'm able to watch it diligently and pull it out at an moments notice if need be. Plus, I like the daily involvement and strategy of it more than other types.

Here's my background: I'm about to graduate from medical school, and I don't have any 'buffer."" This is all entirely for experimentation and fun to see what I can do and it will most certainly be part time once I start residency (hence why I need to pull my money out daily and not worry about checking my trades in the middle of a surgery). Because I have doctor sized loans right now, I'm only able to do this thanks to the Robinhood app. I put in $40 as a Hanukkah gift for myself. :) I'm will never deposit more than $50-100 as a seasonal gift. So when it's gone, it's gone, until the next gift-giving holiday. That being said, I'd love to grow it into something that will put a little bit of play money in my pocket, and help me seriously tackle those loans early on.

In three days I've gotten my $40 up to $58, which I feel like is pretty good for never doing this before! But I've always been a diligent and careful student, and I'm not about to assume I know anything about what I'm doing. That's what I want your opinions for!

I currently put stops that don't allow me to loose more than $0.02 on any stock, and I'm using mostly penny stocks since I have such a low budget to work with (but I'm looking to move away from that asap). I did invest in 2 'longer term' stocks: $SQ and $GGB, but I may sell those in a few days, idk yet.

Using robinhood, I signed up for the margin account because w/ only $40 It was really frustrating to have to wait 3 days to be able to use the money from the stocks I sold. And as you know you aren't allowed to 'pattern day trade' as a result without a 25k minimum.

So here is my day/night trading strategy (really more like a theory at this point) as a work around that little issue. I used similar methods describe by all day traders (per google % youtube) to identify which stocks are most likely going to be hot the following day (news, chat rooms, expert opinion, etc.) and I invest in those as close to 4pm as possible. Unless of course there is a run to the bell, then I invest in that as soon as I see the trend. The following morning I immediately sell the stocks that rose significantly right before closing (or gained a gap in after hours), and watch the ones that I 'predicted' would be hits. I'm not greedy, and I sell as soon as I see signs that the trend is changing. This counts as 2 market days so I won't be flagged.

Obviously, it's going to be harder to identify which stocks are going to trend tomorrow morning because so much of the news comes in overnight, so there's obviously greater risk, which is part of why I chose to be so unforgiving in my parameter's when considering the trends of the chart.

What are your thoughts on this strategy? Has anyone done this successfully? (Small success is ok, I'm not looking for a new career here) Is there a giant area of potential failure that could slaughter me that it seems like I'm failing to consider here? Once/if I'm able to make enough, I'll likely switch to another broker or downgrade my account to where I don't have these limits, but right now I can't afford anything more than free.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!",2,0.63,1481389138,"[['SQ', 1]]",SQ,13.649999618530273,14.600000381469727
t3_5mfj9c,Advice for a new trader - how to determine a good opportunity,"Hello everyone. I'm writing this for a friend of mine who wants to start daytrading stocks. My experience is working as charting platform tech support for a forex dealing desk for 5 years but never really trading beyond demo accounts. This is just stuff I've gleaned from that job. All my links are from [babypips.com](http://www.babypips.com/school) because that's what I'm familiar with.

Please chime in if I screwed something up or if you have a comment, a favorite bookmark, or a book that you wish you had when you first started out.

His question: 
> How do you figure out what to buy and when to sell it?

My answer:
Unless you understand your own reasons to make a trade, you're just guessing and the odds will not be in your favor. Keep emotion out of your decision making process or it's no better than a casino.

The three ways to identify a good market:

* technical indicators (charts)
* news/sentiment (public emotion/confidence)
* fundamental analysis (supply and demand, economic, and political factors)

# Technical indicators:
Indicators are lines drawn on your chart either directly on the price chart or tucked in a subgraph below the chart. 

There are hundreds of technical indicators that you can learn, but the most common indicators are called Moving Averages, specifically the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to identify trends. See the image below they have highlighted where the SMAs have crossed above and below eachother. Those would've been good times to buy or sell:

http://i.imgur.com/AhhG9PX.png


# [News/Sentiment](http://www.babypips.com/school/undergraduate/freshman-year/market-sentiment/what-is-market-sentiment.html)

This means actively reading twitter and news and forums and getting a feel for how people feel about the market. 

If you were interested in investing in Yahoo right now, you would probably find a hostile sentiment because of the terrible new CEO, their recent email hacks and password leaks, and just overall dissatisfaction with every product they offer (news, search, email, etc).

With Tesla's new Gigafactory officially pumping out batteries this week, they might be a good target to trade the news with as people finally start to buy and use their product en masse. But keep watching the news because prices will dip if folks start getting into accidents due to a defect.

# [Fundamental Analysis](http://www.babypips.com/school/high-school/fundamental-analysis/what-is-fundamental-analysis.html)

Understanding things like interest rates, laws that affect the each market, where a company gets its supplies, and deeper events and circumstances that will drive the market. Cause and effect.

For example if more governors like Michigan Governor Snyder cut food stamps in half, more families would be buying Great Value than Kraft and Kellogg's. Or would they be buying more Kraft and Kellogg's but less produce? Someone out there knows because that's part of their strategy.

Which brings me to the question, aren't algorithms the best at consistently sticking to a strategy? If all everyone's trying to do is trade based on the technical patterns, why doesn't everyone just run algorithms? What are the best traders doing that makes them outperform an algorithm?

I want to make every trade count, since I can only do 2 or 3 a week essentially. 

I am fine with setting a 10% stop-loss right now, since I have a small account and it's still less then I would be comfortable losing at a poker or BJ table anyways. But what should my target be for gains? I just had a tiny window to take a 7% gain, but held off to try to maximize it. Then of course in a blink the gains nearly disappeared.

I had a difficult time today getting in any type of rhythm.  At times it was like no matter what I did a stock wouldn't move for me.  This is real life as a day trader.  Sometimes everything works and then the next day you can't get the ball rolling.  Quite a few asked for entries and exits so I am going to do that the best I can with my best trades.  I will try to offer some explanation as to why I bought and why I sold.

Today's Profit:  $1,556.98
Total Trades : 180
Total Commissions: $465.17

Best Trades:

ZNGA for a total of $260.13

BOT +5,000 ZNGA MKT 4.05 Filled @4.044 1/13/2018 14:48:32
BOT +5,000 ZNGA MKT 4.05 Filled @4.044 1/13/2018 14:48:38

SOLD -5000 ZNGA MKT 4.06 Filled @4.062948 1/13/2018 14:56:22

I bought ZNGA around the 4 dollar area earlier in the day and it didn't react like I wanted and sold for a very minor profit.  Later in the day I bought as above.  This was purely based off of reading the tape also known as time and sales.  As I watched buyers pour into the stock, there were virtually no sellers.  The more I watched the more I thought the momentum was to the upside at the time.  I bought in and waited for them to take the stock up.  It only up ticked a penny and sat there.  There still were no sellers so I remained in the stock.  As you can see I bought 10k shares total of the stock so just a 2 cent move is worth 200 dollars.  When I sold it was also from reading the time and sales of the stock and noticed once the stock reached a 4.07 bid, a lot of selling began.  I was able to sell one of my 5000 share orders at 4.07 but the second I was unable to place the order in time and therefore was filled with a 4.06 bid.  

I referred yesterday to someone about price improvement, dark pools, and order flow.  As you look you can see where the price was when I bought $4.05.  When I bought and was filled they gave me 4.044.  That is a price improvement of .6 of a cent or 30 dollars when buying 5000 shares.  They filled both orders at that price.  So now when the stock went up a penny, instead of being up 100 dollars I was actually up 160 dollars.  As you can also see on my sales, instead of getting filled on the exact price of the bid they gave me price improvement on my sales.  These types of orders ADD UP ALL DAY LONG.  These are dark pools who pay for retail order flow.  It is true they are trading against me, but as you can see, they don't always win.

Second Trade $TPH for a total of $104.69

This trade was a momentum trade at a round number.  It had a lot of volume today which I call ""expanding volume"".  If you look at the daily chart the volume for the day is much higher than previous days.  As a day trader it is important to notice things like this INTRADAY.  They give trades all day long.  I missed most of the day but traded this at the round number of $19 for a scalp.

BOT +1,900 TPH  MKT @ 19.00 Filled @18.999 1/3/2018 14:39:08

Sold - 1900 TPH MKT @ 19.05 Filled @ 19.055 1/3/2019 14:39:13

This trade is much more typical of my trading style.  As you can see I took a quick scalp and was only in the trade for 5 seconds.  In and out all day long.

I don't really have a bad trade to post that I could teach anything.  I tried buying INTC off of some news after it had sold off and sold it for a $23 dollar loss.  That was actually my worst loss of the day.  There is really nothing to learn from it.  I thought perhaps the news would pop the stock and it didn't work.

Finally I posted the times of the above trades so anyone that has the ability to replay the markets can go back and watch the time and sales as I traded.

My thought process (look at 1 min chart for today $CAPR):

Using my scanner, I noticed that $CAPR had a large percent gain premarket. I started to monitor it and wanted to short but it was listed as hard to borrow (HTB). I did not want to buy too early into market open because I was not sure where the reversal would be. I waited for the stock to settle and tried to get filled at around $2.00 but was not able to because of very low volume. I eventually got filled around 2.05 and waited for some type of breakout. At one point I was minus about $200.  I assumed there would be at least a small breakout based on past history and the fact that it was a volatile small-cap biotech stock. There was a small breakout and I sold my shares at $2.09 one cent under its peak. 

Overall it was a good trade but I could have been more patient and tried to be filled at a lower price. Every $0.02 is ~1% on your money.

t3_7w6fde,I need advice from people who know infinitely more than I do about this.,"So, I'm 29, I'm 3 semesters away from graduating with a bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, and I wanted to learn as much as I could about swing trading so that when I'm earning a good income, I'll be able to grow my money (theoretically) through swing trading and short term investment. My livelihood doesn't depend on this, I'm approaching this mainly as a hobby / learning experience, so please, no lectures about how I don't know shit about shit and shouldn't be risking money on shit I don't know, etc. I understand that I don't know shit. That's why I'm here.

So after contemplating entering the cruel world of trading for about 6 months, I did the responsible thing and kept my day job, saved up $2000, and was comfortable making enough to where I could afford to lose that $2000 and not miss a beat. I'll be fine if I lose that money. It was worth saving up for because I wanted to experience how the market works first hand.

Now, for the questions.

For short term trading, say, anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks (swing trading), am I looking at technical indicators at all? I know some people in short term trading prefer to trade stocks with a beta of 2 or over. Higher volatility means higher short term gains / losses, etc. I know that many people also prefer trading with stocks that have high volume (500k+) for liquidity, which I'm not sure is a primary concern for me right now, seeing as how I don't have an enormous initial fund and can't buy 5,000 shares of anything anyway. What are some technical indicators that you look for when you're doing short term investment? Aside from the few essential indicators, do you find them ultimately misleading / impertinent when investing short term since the overall ""health"" of the company is not as important to you as it would be to a long term investor?

Is setting a stop-loss or trailing stop % or $ ultimately self defeating for new traders who have absolutely no experience in the organic oscillations of a real marketplace? I find it really funny, in a way, that on all the websites and journal articles that explain how to trade profitably show examples where the stock trend takes on a laughably elementary form, such as a textbook wedge or channel up or down, when in the real world, most stocks appear as amorphous, snaking creatures with no discernible form whatsoever (at least to me). It also seems to me that, if a REAL investor were to come across a stock with a textbook indicator to BUY BUY BUY, I would have extremely little chance, as someone with no experience, to beat them to the punch. By the time I noticed it, the bonanza would be over, so to speak. So what trends, specifically, do you look for? What price range do you look for? I know that stocks with higher prices tend to be less volatile than cheaper ones. But at what point do you refuse to invest in a stock because of it's low price? At what price does a stock have to be to lend itself to the chance of being pumped and dumped by people who have infinitely more money than you?

t3_7wodd0,Tax Implications of Trading - From a CPA,"Once a trader has experienced success and the wonderful opportunity of paying taxes they quickly realize the importance of trader tax status  â it unlocks a wealth of benefits.

One of the most frequent questions I receive from traders is, âWhat is the difference between filing a return as a trader vs. investorâ?  If I could sum it up in one word it would be DEDCUTIONS!

If you qualify for trader tax status, you get to file a business tax return and claim business expenses. This allows you to take many more deductions than youâd be able to take if you filed as an investor. Investors are severely limited under the tax code from deducting trading 

Expenses for an investor are filed on a Schedule A, they are classified as miscellaneous itemized deductions. This means that they must be greater than 2% of your adjusted gross income. It also means you can deduct only the amount  that exceeds the 2% limit!

For example, if your AGI is $100,000, your expenses must be greater than $2,000 in order for you to deduct them. If your expenses are $3000, you can deduct only $1000 (the amount over the 2% limit) from your taxes.

Traders are not subject to this limitation since they will claim all of their business expenses. This enables them to deduct ALL expenses associated with their trading business.

INVESTMENT INTEREST EXPENSE LIMITATION

Investors can deduct margin interest as an itemized deduction on their Schedule A but only to the extent of their net investment income. Any excess investment interest expenses are carried over to the following tax year to be deducted in the same way.

Traders are not subject to this limitation. They deduct margin interest in full on Schedule C as a business expense instead of an itemized deduction.  Since margin interest for most traders can run many thousands of dollars, this is a HUGE tax advantage.

HOME OFFICE AND EDUCATION EXPENSES

Investors cannot deduct home office expenses or education expenses. This is another big tax savings for traders. Even if you rent your home or apartment, a trader can take the home office deduction, opening up thousands of dollars in tax savings every year!

MARK TO MARKET ACCOUNTING

One of the most beneficial aspects of trader tax status is the ability to claim mark to market accounting. If you make this election, your trading losses wonât be subject to the $3000 capital loss limitation that investors are stuck with. Instead, your capital gains/losses are treated as ordinary gains/losses. Ordinary losses donât have a limit and can be used to offset any income. This is a huge benefit for a trader who has a bad year.

I've been trading crypto for 2 years now with the past 6 months solely relying on day trading as my main source of income. I trade using TA and extremely simple strategies based off oscillators and trend based indicators. I learned TA from youtube and reading pirated ebooks and now after trading crypto for so long it's become kinda of a nuisance to trade. The high fees make automation of scalping strategies extremely difficult.

I started own my own trading firm (of just 4 traders) who also trade crypto with me full time. We all want to switch over to the big boy markets where there is more liquidity so we don't keep running into problems when filling orders like you do in crypto markets.

If I simply buy when LTC is rising, and place a stop loss RIGHT under the price... What harm can be done? Worst case scenario, the price falls, stop loss triggers, (I also understand that stop losses don't always execute at the EXACT price) and I lose a few dollars. Best case scenario, price goes up $5, and I cash out...

t3_8efage,Freshman in college looking for advice,"So, I am currently at the end of my freshman year and I am about to go into summer and I am looking for some advice for what I can spend some of my time over the summer doing. 
Throughout this year I have been deeply exploring different types of careers I can have in a more quant focused side of finance. I first looked at things such as IB, Private Equity, and Hedge Funds, and I am still interested in those fields; however, instead of the traditional analyst route, I recently started looking at the sales and trading positions.
I am not sure if cryptocurrency is a taboo here, but I have also been, not so seriously, ""trading"" it for about a year now. As in I apply crappy TA to charts and buy and sell based on some arbitrary TA.
What I have discovered though is that I am very interested in the idea of trading , and I was mainly wondering if someone knew what some of the most in-demand types of trading are. 
I thought that once I knew what the most in-demand types of trading are I could start learning from there with paper trading on thinkorswim, or something similar.
My thought process is that if I begin exploring some of the higher in demand fields early on, and I find out I enjoy them, I will be able to market myself as having the skills needed later on in my carrer.

As stated and had shown in my earlier posts, I started April with about $50k in my account.  Today I'm finishing at $176k after commissions which total over $15k for this month (conservative estimate).  So for April, it means I generated $141k trading ($15k commissions + $126k net profit).

Today I traded the ES (S&P e-mini futures) from opening until around 1:30 pm (last trade was 1:36 pm).  After 1:30 pm the market became hard to predict accurately, so I stopped for the day up $41,000 after commissions.  I had one trade catch five ticks on 100 contracts in under six seconds.  That's $1250 per tick or $6250 for the trade ($12.50 per tick x 100 contracts x 5 ticks).  I felt my trade performance was excellent today (see the second image).  Took a small loss on the part of a trade I scaled up on, but overall a profit factor of 30 is a good number.

If someone had an account with just $4000 or $5000, they could make $400 to $500 a day trading the ES with 2 to 4 contracts per trade with the right strategy and mindset.

I learned an interesting lesson this month.  The key to being a successful trader is to focus on the process of trading and not the results from trading.  I found out that I was starting to become too detached from the results (the money) and had to step back and ensure I was treating this as a business and not as a casino with a broken slot machine giving away money.

I would highly recommend anyone getting started in day trading to find one or two instruments to trades and focus on them.  Do gamble on weekly options, a hot stock of the day, or any other get rich in the market scheme.  Making money is about grinding it out one trade at a time.  There are many trades I could have left on longer and made more money, but there are also trades I could have left on longer and lost money.  Maybe in time, I'll look at letting some of them run longer, but for now, I'm focused on just making winning trades.  ",75,1.0,1524622312,"[['ES', 2]]",ES,58.75,59.9900016784668

Having a couple days off made me realize that I donât need to have more than $100,000 in the account I actively trade futures with so I'm going to keep sweeping the account down to $100,000.  Might move that number down to $75,000 but $100,000 for now.   A few reasons for this.  One, I donât need the money in the account to trade.  Two, itâll be nice to have checks arriving in the mail.   Itâll bring everything into perspective to see checks arriving for thousands of dollars as opposed to just numbers on a computer screen.

Friday just after the market opens I entered a long for 50 ES futures contracts.  Added 50 contracts more a few seconds later (each tick is $12.50 per contract).  Fast forward 90 seconds and Iâm closing the trade down $16,614.00 (roughly 12 ticks plus commissions).  So, there I am down $16,614.00 less than 5 minutes into the day.  

https://i.imgur.com/q4QBGk6.png

I didnât let the loss bother me as it wasn't even close the largest hole I've traded my way out of.  In hindsight, the last few mornings have been a little more unpredictable than usual and maybe Iâll back test letting a trend develop after opening before entering a trade.  This would mean waiting 2 to 3 minutes after opening before taking my first trade.  There are times of the day that you shouldn't be in the market as a technical trader and this might be added to my short list of times.

After closing that $16,614 loss, fast forward two minutes and Iâm in my second trade of the day.  This time a short for 100 ES contracts.  I let this trade run a little longer than normal as the market is tanking and I keep moving my profit target down as the market falls.  The open P/L on this trade runs up to roughly $11,000 profit and then back to a $5,000 profit.  I consider closing it for a profit and then re-enter after it's done retracing.  I end up staying in the trade as the overall trend for the market is to keep heading down and the retrace appears to be weakening.  A few minutes later the open P/L starts hitting the $18,000 profit range and I just close the trade.  I lose a tick or so as opposed to putting a limit order in but I knew I would end up even with a little slippage.  When the volatility starts to get really high and I have a large profit, I will sometimes just close the order as opposed to placing a limit order.  At this point, my second trade is closed and Iâm up $884.50 after commissions.  That was the start of over a $40,000 run with only a couple small losses on part of two trades for the rest of the day.  These small losses occur when I scale up on a trade (e.g.  I enter a trade for 20 contracts, the market moves against me for a couple ticks, and I then add on 20 more when the market started heading in my direction).

Recorded my most recent trade (Video link included). Would like some input from experienced traders.","I can't get over the thought that this is all a fluke. Like ""this is too good to be true."" It should NOT be possible to just spend 30 minutes watching a chart / price action, make a trade on momentum, get out when it seems the trend is reversing, and make hundreds and even thousands of dollars. 

Because I have this thought process I keep trading a mix of real money and simulator. 

STRATEGY: 

My strategy is as bare-bones as you can get. It's super simple. 

I prefer short positions, so I stick to that. I look for any stocks that are gapping up or down at least 2% pre-market, with at least 100,000 volume pre-market. Average true range is at least .50 cents. 

I will start watching my list around 8:45 AM. Because I'm short bias, I look for stocks that are significantly under VWAP during all pre-market. Preferably, they aren't bouncing over and under 9 EMA, but are using 9EMA as solid resistance. 

Then I look at the daily chart and find any key levels of support (where it might bounce) or resistance (where it might reject). 

I TELL myself not to trade in the first five minutes, but often I do. I can usually tell in the first two minutes if a trade is breaking down the way I want (I don't have the same ability for long positions). So I'll short then. 

Also, I USED to look for some fundamental catalyst like news stories or whatever, but now I see that it really makes no difference. Even on good news, if the chart and price action is telling me it's going to break down...then it usually does. 

Also, with shorting positions, I'm able to for some reason (psychologically) let myself get out of the position a lot faster if it's turning against me. 

TOOLS:

Broker is SureTrader. People tell me it sucks, but I like it a lot so far. I almost always have shorts available (even when people over at Interactive Brokers don't). I get charged .01 cents per share...which I don't think is too bad. Trading 1,000 shares in and out will cost me $20. It allows me to get around PDT for the time-being and I really like that they have a debit card that takes like 1 - 2 business days to transfer money on. It's actually really convenient. 

Scanner is Trade Ideas - SUPER expensive (like $250 a month or so) but completely worth it. 

I read this guy's book called *How To Day Trade For A Living* and I really liked it, so I signed up for his chat room at BearBullTraders.com (although I don't really join in, I just like the weekly recap emails - being in a chatroom influences my decisions too much). 

On the member's area he had his whole Trade Ideas setups available, so I just used his, with his settings. And I really like it a lot. 

INDICATORS:

Japanese candlesticks, VWAP, 9 EMA, and 20 EMA.

Those seem to work best for me. From what I've seen so far, those indicators are the absolute most reliable. If a stock is under VWAP, it's likely to stay there for most (if not all) of the day. 

9 EMA I've found is a really great support/resistance tool. If I'm going short, I will wait to get out of a position until 9EMA breaks through - that's a good indicator that the trend has reversed on me. 

So using this strategy/setup, here is Monday's trade video: https://youtu.be/Nl8CuM2ikPs 

I went short TMUS 500 shares, covered at about 5 minutes in, saw that I was being silly and the trend was continuing, so I immediately went back in short. All in all profit for these two trades was about $550.

RULES:

I stop trading as fast as I can. When I'm using my SureTrader account or my demo account, I do the same. I'll make $500 to $1,000 within the first 15 minutes and just STOP. 

I'll wait around a bit to see if there are any other solid opportunities (something rapidly tanking and washing out for example) and I may make another $500 to $1,000 but I don't force it. 

No matter what, I shut the computer off after exactly one hour - close everything, shut the computer down, and walk away. 

If I LOSE a trade, I don't let it bother me. I will continue trading. BUT, if I lose TWO trades I notice I start ""revenge trading."" So, if I lose two trades either consecutively, or I make back my first losing trade, just to lose it again, then I just STOP. 

I walk away. Those are my rules. 

ADVICE:

I grew up pretty poor, was broke most of my 20s, and bootstrapped my way into a successful online business by my early thirties (I'm 31 now). 

And although my business got streamlined to the point where I was working maybe 2 to 3 hours a day, the mental energy that went into that work was still really taxing. 

So because of my upbringing (I think poverty mindset may have been pounded into my head) and the work I had to do to make decent money before, EVERYTHING in my brain is telling me ""money isn't supposed to be this easy to make.""

So I keep second-guessing myself. 

For example...I must be missing something. There is no way such a simple strategy is sustainable - it's supposed to be much more complex than this. You're just getting lucky - you're going to lose it all. 

The list goes on. 

I think it would help if I heard from some traders who have been doing this for much longer than I have. 

Like - am I going insane? I hear sometimes that ""trading is SO SO SO hard!""

But from what I gather, it's not so much reading charts and price action that's hard - or finding stocks in play - it's managing emotions, not bagholding, not trying to predict movements or ""have faith"" that the trend will change in your favor - like all of that psychological stuff is what makes it ""difficult"" and not so much the actual METHOD of a good trade. 

I guess I just want to know if I'm on the right track here. And that I'm not going crazy that my strategy is solid and this is a good way to go about the trading morning.

Traditionally the last hour of the day hasn't been a big winner for me, so I try to refrain from trading from 3 pm to close.   This is an issue I'm aware of, and I'm working on adjustments to my strategies for just the last hour.

(Note that the number of trades isn't accurate because with NinjaTrader it's based on how an order fills.  Meaning if I buy 50 contracts and it fills as 2, 5, 3, 5, 5, 18, 2, 1, 2, and 7 contracts it'll show up as 10 ""trades"" while a trade for 20 contracts that fills all 20 at once will show up as one trade. The important number to look at is the profit factor ratio.)

The market was a little more volatile than usual today.  I like to trade when the ATR (Average True Range) is around 3 to 5 ticks per minute, but today it was more like 5 to 7 ticks.  Had one 40 contract trade go against me very fast for 12 ticks (see Trade Performance report under short trades gross loss).  This is the danger of days like today.  You literally can have the market run up and down 3 points in one 30 second candle.  This almost hitting my stop.  After the trade moved against me,  knew it wouldn't hold so I added on another 40 contracts to the position and rode the candle back down to end up with a small profit for the overall trade.

The last trade of the day was one of my best trades for about $5000.  I was short 40 contracts.  The market is trying it's best to hold and was moving sideways for about 4 minutes.  I knew at some point the market would give way and fall so I stacked on another 60 contracts.  I had a limit order in to cover my now 100 contracts short position with a one point profit (4 ticks, $5000).  The market came down near my order but never the full point down.  I considered moving my order up but decided that the market was going to fall and fall fast so I would remove my limit order and manually close the order when it did.  The market did fall, and when I saw my position was up five ticks, I pressed the close button.

When the ATR and overall market volatility is high, I'm torn between two adjustments to my strategy.  One would be to tighten my profit targets and stops along with making larger trades.  The second could be to widen out my profit targets and stops along with making smaller trades.  I tried both today, and they both seem to work. You can see by my average trade time (see Trade Performace report) that I was in a lot of trades for more than my usual one or two minutes.  These were all the smaller contract trades with the wider profit target and stop loss adjustments.  Personally, I would rather be in the market as short of time as possible, but they both worked.

t3_8gl6gs,"Made $11,954 on the first day of May trading the ES","Was shooting for a 10k day but I saw a couple more opportunities and ended up $11,954 for the day after commissions. Didn't take a lot of trades today and most trades were taken between 9:30 and 10 am. After 10 am, I averaged about one trade an hour after that. 

Took a loss on the part of a trade (20 contracts scaled up to 40 contracts). I was short and had to adjust my profit target to cover as the orders sitting on the bid were 4 to 5 times normal. We usually don't see this many orders on the bid but the last couple times I noticed this the market pivoted for the day. In this case, the market fell another 2 points before recovering nearly 25 points.

Here is a quick breakdown of a couple of my trades for today. What I'm looking for is the ES to become range bound. It'll usually be range bound for 10 to 20 minutes before breaking out, and I'm trying to catch small movements (2 to 3 ticks) during these times as the ES trades within about a 2 point (12 tick) range. The key, when taking range bound trades, this is to only take trades in the direction you are expecting the ES to break out too. In this case, I was looking for the ES to break down, so I only entered short positions. The first was 30 contracts short for 3 ticks ($12.50 x 3 ticks x 30 contracts = $1125) and other was for 40 contacts short for 2 ticks ($12.50 x 2 ticks x 40 contracts = $1,000).

Trade Performace Report:
https://i.imgur.com/WzPqk1y.png

Iâll quickly breakdown my first trade.  Indicators used: Wave Trend, Woody's CCI, ATR, and Volume Profile (100 tick chart only).  I use the Wave Trend and Woody's CCI on nine charts (60m, 30m 15m, 5m, 4m, 3m, 2m, 1m, and 30s).  I'm mainly watching the 1m and 30s charts and look at the longer interval charts (5m to 60m) before the day starts and sometimes randomly throughout the day.  I trade off the 30s chart and glance at the other time frames (1m to 4m) to ensure all of the trends align to indicate the direction of the market.  For the longer time frames (3 or 4 minutes), I want them to at least be starting to align with the shorter time frames (2m, 1m, and 30s).  

The reason I watch the trends from multiple timeframes is that I don't want to be trading against the flow of the market.  If the market is going up, I'm going long.  If the market is going down, I'm going short.  The logic behind this is if my entry is not timed correctly and the market retraces for a point or two, it'll eventually come back in line with the overall trend and hence my position.  This is the difference between being in a trade for 10 to 30 seconds vs. 2 to 5 minutes. 

You can see in the image below that the one minute Wave Trend and Woody's CCI is trying to hold and possibly change direction but gives way at 11:41 am. 

https://i.imgur.com/qlgPvrT.png

The three minute Wave Trend and Woody's CCI showed no sign of weakness at 11:41 am and that's an indication that the one minute trend will not hold long or change direction but will continue down.

t3_8k2d9t,Let's talk strategy ...,"So, I've recently completely and totally changed my outlook on trading and developed a new strategy. This has taken my day trading to a completely new level, and my gains have drastically increased. 

A very basic overview of my previous strategy was momentum small caps. I had a high win percentage (approx 70%) and generally, my winners were almost always 3:1 profit ratio... you might be thinking that's pretty good, and it is- the issue was that once or twice per month , Is suffer a major, seemingly unavoidable loss... 

Those who trade small caps will know the pain of an order being skipped, especially as the stock falls at a fast rate. Even though I'd sometimes make 5-10k per month on average- I'd sometimes give 50% of that back in 1 single trade . For example, my last big loss was on LEDS about a month ago, I was in 2000 shares after a halt, and pressed my ""bail out 20c offset below the bid"" hotkey as soon as it came down to my entry point - as sometimes happens, it moved so fast it skipped my order and I got stuck in the halt on the way down , it was almost 2.5 points down when I managed to get out after the halt. Half a months gains, wiped out in 30 seconds - and technically, I didn't make an error, just part of trading. 

Just to recap, my old strategy consisted of a combination of gap & go low floats, 1 min & 5 min bullflags, reversals (usually bottom reversals only). 

My new strategy is now very strict with stock price and extremely simplified as to the patterns I play. I only ever trade stocks over $10 and under $100 now. I only ever trade 1 pattern - gap down & fade. (It may be a quick scalp under low of pre-market, or a hold for a continued move to the downside. ) I also never enter a trade past 10:30am, but I will continue to hold if it's in my favor. My last strict rule is that I can only take 4 trades per day. (I allow myself a 5th if all 4 were green). This has helped me to not only stop over trading, but also to cut my losses on a red day- in the past, like many of us, I have been guilty of turning a -$500 losing day to -$1000 or more just by being desperate and trying and get back to break even. 

One final thing about my new strategy is that I changed from my old broker to a European CFD. If you don't know what that is, look into it , but very basically the reasoning behind is is because with CFD's you can short ANY stock (doesn't need to be ""available"" and you also get filled ANY amount of shares (Even if there is only 100 shares on the bid at say 19.70, you can get filled 500 shares at that exact price, instantly). The ""downside"" is that you can only get filled on the bid when shorting, or on the ask when going long- but you simply need to reduce the slippage by trading only stocks with high liquidity, hence low spreads of no more than 1-2 cents. CFD's are definitely NOT for everybody, but they are a huge advantage for my particular strategy. 

What has this resulted in? Almost exactly the same general stats, my win rate is currently about 65% and profit loss ration approx 1:3 , very similar than before, but I end up with about 8-10k in my pocket at the end of each month. Instead of blowing 4-5k on a single trade, and previously cutting my profits  to 5k, I now keep most of my profits. 

Anyway, I'd like to hear a brief summary (doesn't have to be detailed as much as mine) of some of your successful / unsuccessful strategies, what works / doesn't work and why- I think it would be very helpful for both new and experienced traders to share here.

I thought I share a review of my strategy today on MU.  I go through my morning ritual of looking at news on Benzinga and pre\-market movers on Barchart.  MU is almost always on high volume list, because it's a favorite for traders to trade.  In the picture above, I mark down all the premarket highs and lows, and they act as my support/resistance levels.  As the morning bell open, MU just tanks in the first 2 mins and breaks through VWAP.  I'm looking to see if the stock will print a 2 minute pullback green candle and hold under VWAP but it just blows right through it towards premarket low.  I'm still waiting for a pullback to see if anything happens. 

At 6:43am, it starts pulling back, so it peaks my interest.  Several things can happen at this point: 1) Price reverses, crosses VWAP and heads towards premarket high, 2) Price hits VWAP, reverses and goes back towards premarket low or 3) Price chops and continues lower.  As price hits VWAP, I see that the 9ema is about to cross the VWAP, so I set my short order at $61 with a stop loss at $61.20 and profit target of $60.50, low of the day.  My risk is 20cents to make 50cents.

Anyways, the point of this post is again, just to share my strategy, thought process and anticipating the trade.  Not all trades work out like this but this was particularly a good one.  A lot of people just say ""hey just use these indicators or look at price action"" but how do you use it?  I'm hoping this example helps struggling traders.

My first trade was in BLUE. It opened and went down hard. It showed up in my scanner as having a lot of bearish momentum from the open. I like to trade these high priced MOMO stocks on the open because they usually have the largest $ changes and I can put a lot of capital to work without buying a ton of shares like the folks that chase the low priced stocks. I went short when the stock broke the trendline on a large red candle. Usually, I donât like to make trades like this when they retrace a lot of their opening move. In this case though, the large red bar captured a lot of that move again and I like it in the sense that it has the potential to squeeze the longs. I went short on the following bar and and held for about 20 minutes. It sat there and consolidated and then when it tried to move lower again, it was rejected and bought up telling me that I need to exit the stock. 10 minutes later (after I had exited), it broke lowerâ¦ I ended up losing about $1 on this trade and the move was $6.

However, I'm doing my due dilligance and will be paper trading for a long time while I study, practice and educate myself. 

However the biggest question ultimately will be ""What will I trade?"" And I've narrowed it to E Mini S%P Futures or Forex. 

The attraction to both is a) Smaller capital requirements, meaning I can persue this as a hobby and keep the bankroll still at a 'fun' level (5k or so to start I'm expecting) b) Simplified analysis - what I mean by this is I don't want to be hunting for stocks, or companies and doing hours and hours of research and homework every morning and at night. 

I'm an obsessive guy and I'll 100% be the guy who can't put his ipad or laptop down because I'm still reading the latest business news. 

Going with Forex I can choose one single pair and just become an expert of it. Futures is the same thing in that the S&P is one chart. That's it. Simple. 

The time wasted hunting down company stock to swap can be used on working on a strong trading strategy, or refining my risk management technique. 

However, between the two I'm having a much harder time figuring out where to go with this.

t3_901wd7,Just a little insight on Volume,"[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Vxxw6u7H/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Vxxw6u7H/)

Today MU was one of my trades and after reviewing my charts, I noticed something that I think is noteworthy to other new traders.  It's something that I read before but never really notice.  In the picture I drew 3 squares so I'll just refer to it as I go along.  In square #1, you see the action pull back from upward momentum but also there's a significant decrease in volume.  This is pretty indicative of a pullback.  The volume increases in the following candlestick which means that the price will continue to move in the upward direction.  In square #2, you see the volume beginning to fade in the previous candles with downward momentum and a small spike in volume but the price fails to move higher.  This is a failed attempt at moving upwards and the price continues to drop.  Square #3 is another downward pullback.  Price moves up but the volume is decreased.  The next volume comes in on the next candle and price moves even lower.

Many of you already know this but I had a bit of trouble navigating through the price and volume.  Hope this helps people with the same problems as me but don't use volume as the only indicator.  Chart patterns, indicators and volume should all be used together to decide whether you should enter a trade or not.

t3_901rwa,Brand new to stocks!,"Hey guys, completely new to this stock trading thing. As of right now all Iâve done is watched a 10 min YouTube vid and downloaded TDAmeritrade app and setup the account. As far as some financial background I literally live dirt cheap. I pay about 200 bucks in bills each month and I earn about 2k a month. Iâve had around 15k sitting in a checking account for almost a year now and every time it gets higher I just blow it on stupid shit(2k dollar casino losses). I searched up this reddit on a whim(much like how I gamble at the casinos) and I was looking to open up some dialog with educated people for a broader picture of what day trading is all about. Sure I can go do my own research and get more intel; which I will in due course. I just wanted to get this answered in laymanâs terms.


So letâs see, I checked up on a stock called PED(Pedevco Corp) and a few days ago it was around 1.50 a share. Then around Tuesday afternoon it almost hit 3.50 a share.

So basically if I bought 5k in stock on Mondayâs low and sold Tuesdayâs high I would be a winner? Thatâs what itâs all about? Just a gamble on it going up or down? Is it that easy? When I want to sell it just instantly goes through and Iâm done?? So if I had bought stock and when it got high and I was ready to get out I just click sell and itâs over?

Is TD Ameritrade a good place to trade?

Will have tons more questions the more I educate myself but I donât want to get over my head here.

t3_92h6gz,I tried my first day trade today with AWX.,"As the title suggests, I paid the most attention to AWX today during my first bout with day trading. I bought in at $6.10 a little after the bell and got a little jumpy (dude to inexperience, as youâll note in a second) and sold when it hopped up to $6.60. I was pretty pleased with the $50 I made on the trade until I literally watched it go up to $7.45 maybe 10 seconds later. After I watched it peak and valley a little, I bought back in around $7.79 thinking it would keep pushing. I watched it fall and chickened out at $7.35 or so and called it a day, fairly pleased to close out my first ever experience in the, albeit modest, green. Now, Iâm not saying Iâm crushed or anything... but that price closed at $17. 

Overall experience: 10/10 would do again. Would you experienced guys think about buying in at $17 still, or is that jump too extreme, and could it start dipping back?

t3_94qtk7,Honest review of Suretrader after a year,"So around a year ago I got into daytrading, and being from the U.S, well PDT, so only option to do so was suretrader. Even in this past year there are only 3 options(suretrader, CMEG, tradezero) for people who have a small account to daytrade and not get hit with the PDT, only 2(suretrader, CMEG) of them are available for people in the U.S(tradezero us is available but you still are hit with PDT under 25k). Anyways, fastfoward after a year of trading with suretrader here are some things that you should probably know before using them:  


1. Don't use the web platform: it is absolutely horrible, but wait if it is horrible what do I use to trade? You have to buy the DAStrader software and quoting services for $104 a month or the discounted version which doesn't include level 2 for half that. Also this is prorated, meaning you enroll in the platform for July, you get charged in august, also careful if you enroll say July 31st they will charge you for the entire month of July.  The platform itself is great, das is a credible trading software used by a variety of brokers. However most brokers do not charge such a premium for the platform especially when their web platform is horrible and probably has not been updated since its release. 
2. Fees fees fees fees: Ill continue with a some additional fees you should know about. The first is an inactivity fee, this is a 50 dollar fee if you don't make 15 trades in a month, this is the first of many fees that left me scratching my head and thinking why the fuck are they charging people for not making more then 15 trades in a month. I know that most people wouldn't see this as a problem, but all the other brokers I've used never charged me a fee for not trading enough.. Again, if you signup for suretrader july 31st make sure you check your account for the inactivity fee when august comes. Next the liquidation fee/margin call fee, now if your EQ% falls below 17% it is exceeding 6:1 leverage intraday or if it falls below 50%(2:1 leverage) after 3:30 pm est, your position will be instantly liquidated, take note that this can even happen post/pre market where liquidity is nonexistent at times. Why do I have to get within 2:1 by 3:30 est? Doesn't the market close at 4? Good question, I asked them multiple times and they never gave me a straight answer, was always a different answer. This essentially puts you at a disadvantage, causing you to close your position or reduce it resulting in another trade fee/loss. Again other brokers do not do this, they understand it would put their traders at a disadvantage if a move happened in that last 30 mins(which the majority of them do..).  If your account drops below 2:1 overnight you're charged the liquidation fee and a margin call fee.. yup both cause why not! They won't give you a chance to fund your account for the call, isn't the point of margin call to provide time frame to deposit funds? Nah they instantly liquidate that premarket charge you the $50 fee and $25 margin call + commissions. Few other tidbits about these fees, if your account falls below $500, the margin position is liquidated and again you're charged the fee, if it drops below $100 your account is completely liquidated. If you are using margin on stocks below $2.50 and are not following the $2.50 equity rule.. liquidated. This btw even goes for if you're shorting a stock and it falls below 2.50 and you're in the green.. yea they'll liquidate you. 
3. Commission: $4.95 min on all trades, little thing they don't tell you is if you trade under 25 shares of a penny stock or below $2.50 they will charge you a $25 inconvenience fee. So you're paying a flat rate of $4.95 and then after its $.01 per share. These commissions may seem like a small amount, but if  you're growing a small account and are over trading they really start to destroy your account. There are certain premiums if you trade excess volume such as: $3.95 for 250k+, $2.95 500k+, $1.95 700k+. If you somehow trade this much volume, they won't automatically reduce your fee, you have to contact them. Here is the super cool part, if you are not from the U.S your trade fee is $1.95 and also if you are over $25k equity and from the U.S your fee is again $1.95.  All these fees are really starting to add up on that small account huh.. like it  was intended to cause people to blow up their accounts for profit.
4. Oh but hey I get to use 6:1 margin though right? I mean maybe? The majority of stocks in which are worth day trading as well as some stocks from weeks or even months ago are put on margin restriction, the majority of the time its 1:1. I'll just get in before the restriction though, recently I've noticed that the stocks are restricted within the first 1-2 mins of the market opening. If you happen to get your trade with margin during that time guess what! your position is liquidated to the margin restriction and again fees fees fees. Sometimes they don't even bother notifying if a stock is restricted or what it is restricted by so you basically have guess or just stick to 1.1.... so much for that 6:1
5. Suretrader's archaic system :100% this system is designed to blow up small accounts. Often times the system does not update your buying power through out the day or sometimes even from the previous evening, they told me an update only happens at 10:00 pm est. So if you are planning on making a trade and its saying not enough buying power you will need to sit on the phone or in chat(if you get an agent ha) for 20 mins before and see if they  can update your buying power.  Also to note, your commissions that are accumulated throughout the day aren't deducted from your account till 10:00 pm EST. They do this so you have more buying power through out the day! But I want to know how much my commissions were and my actual buying power/EQ so I do not get liquidated... too bad  Yea I had that same question, they told me to keep track of it myself. Imagine your bank asking you to keep track of all your debit card transactions and just never displaying them on your statement till 2 weeks down the road. Now if you did not pay the $104 for the dastrader platform, good luck calculating your EQ% and better yet the actual value of your account till 10:00 pm EST. The web platform doesn't show commissions and only adds or subtracts the amount you made or lost off a trade and not commissions. So what ends up happening is alot of people don't actually know what the EQ% is of their account throughout the day and then are baffled when they are liquidated because the EQ% goes by your BP with the deduction of commissions you accumulated thus far on that trading day. According to their outstanding customer services it is our job to keep track of our buying power. Completely my fault, now what if I do not have access to the $104 platform? Oh easy fix you just open a ticket or call customer service and have them tell you your %EQ and update your buying power. Yea the web platform doesn't have an %EQ, it actually has no account information other then your buying power.  So make sure you call and open a ticket after every trade so you know how much is in your account. Or you can wait till 10:00 pm est and find out then. 
6. Constant bugs: over the past year there have been several instances where the entire platform just shuts down intraday and boots you off when you're mid trade. They will not take responsibility for this, even if 1000 people confirm the platform went down, shaggy it wasn't me suretrader. Along with the buying power not updating correctly, your trade fee structure will sometimes get reverted to the standard 4.95, even if you are over 25k or at a volume threshold. Again, if you don't notice that this happened, they won't fix it. Its like they did it on purpose or something.  Keep a close eye on your account for double charges, over the past year I have been double charged 25 times, when I open the ticket and report the double charge, they just remove it and say sorry...25 times sorry. Make sure you account for possible double charges when your calculating your EQ% on your excel spreadsheet through out the day. Another recent thing I've seen happening is suretrader's inability to fill orders during halts even after it said your order has been filled and you clearly see the pnl on your trade window only to find out that it is bugged.
7. Shorts: the one pro to suretrader use to be that their shortlist was awesome. It is no longer awesome, they have a very small list of shorts and when you want to locate it sometimes takes 3 hours to locate shares and then they charge you a fee to locate + hard to borrow fee + another fee on top of that. They barely have any shares to short of any of the big movers throughout the day and when they do you're hesitant cause of mintbroker international's history of buying a stocks entire float through out the week while allowing its clients(yes mintbroker owns suretrader) to short and then revealing that mintbroker has the entire float and they want their shares back.... examples awx,mtsl,gbr. Seems like a conflict of interest but im not a lawyer what do i know.. on top of that probably selling their order flow and information on position sizes to the highest bidder
8. Pros: 6:1 margin on apple stock maybe? yea honestly after a year of this shit I can't see any pros other then avoiding PDT, horrible customer service, outrageous fees, constant bugs, the entire system is built around destroying new traders and accounts. I have recently switched to tradezero US and after a bit I will do a review of that broker, but from my first impression its a step above suretrader.. then again robinhood is probably better then  suretrader at this point. 
9. I would tell you to stay away from this broker, but it is still one of the only options available for small accounts. I highly recommend CMEG over suretrader however.

This may seem like a biased review towards the negative side.. and you're god damn right it is.. the amount of conversations I've had with people about this broker and the issues they've experienced dealing with the inexperienced and rude customer service would leave anyone feeling a little biased towards this broker being a pc of shit. But hey go open an account and make a deposit today! Oh btw you get charged a credit card fee of 1.5% of your deposit and it has to be over $500, or you have to wire again over $500 and get charged a $40 fee. Also you get charged a fee for taking your money out of $50....

t3_9609fw,I need suggestions on what I should do. Portfolio down 14%,"Hello, so I'm extremely new to this. I started trading on July 30, 2018. It has been Ten days (Counting weekdays the market was closed) and I have already lost Fourteen Percent of my portfolio. The first few days I only lost around half a percent trading minimal cheap penny stocks. As I kept researching and figuring things out, I decided to try and buy more shares of penny stocks. This was a mistake as I lost Five Percent in one day, and Ten Percent a few days later. Even though I have only been trading for a week, I can already say that I understand a hell of a lot more than I did when I started. (Btw, I have also gained, they are not only losses.) I am currently holding GST which if the ER and CC are well hopefully it goes up, if not I'm going to have to cut my losses short. So my main question is, what do I do now? What should I do so that I don't keep losing more of my portfolio. I currently use Robinhood for the Zero commission fees. (Robinhood also seems to be a challenge to day trade penny stocks due to not having the OTC market, the stocks on there also do not increase noticeably, making it hard for a 'swing'? Not sure of how to use that word lol.) Please do not tell me to quit day trading, I did not ask for your opinion on whether or not I should quit. I know I will have my failures, but that's part of growing. I will learn from these failures and fine tune my strategy. On that note, I still don't have a strategy lol. I mainly just research before I invest and look at charts using ThinkOrSwim, with VWAP, RSI, etc. Looking at support and resistance levels.

t3_95xa4r,YELP Trade review,"Had a strong opening drive with a close to VWAP bounce off it, which is where an initial trade would have been good, but I was looking at other stocks at the moment. Made a new HOD push after than then consolidated with a nice base at 46.05. I got a very good entry at 46.15 with 500shares and the 9ema also coming up on the price adding to my case. Very good RR here. I let the market come to me in order to get such a good entry with tiny risk and big size did not chase the stock. I took my first half off at 46.70 as we started slowing down at new HOD, and shortly after I took another half as we slowed down again and would look to re add if we consolidated again. It did set up again for another chance to get full size again but I couldnât get a good entry. Also we were approaching a whole number and daily resistance at 47.35 I waited for my last 125 shares to hit that level and see what would happen, we went past quite easily and then I saw a large number of sellers at 47.50 and decided this would be the place to get all out and look to re-enter again. I got all out and then we broke through them again relatively easily, so I did not get another chance to trade it. Stock ended up trading up to 49.31. After I was all out SPY also made a huge run up, surely helping YELP keep grinding up.

Or use a sketchy island broker w/ high commissions(suretrader)

However there is a great way to get past this at-least with interactive brokers. Here is how:

- you have your primary account that you open.

- you open a secondary âlinked accountâ 

- you now can do instant internal transfer and both accounts allow 3 day trades at a rolling 5 day period all on 4x margin if youâd like

- want 9 day trades? Linking new accounts is endless so open 3 if youâd like or 4,5,ect.

The only stipulation to this is how you initially deposited your money into the main account. Certain kinds of deposits require a 44 day clearing time by the ACH before you can transfer that money to another account.
IB treats these linked accounts like other bank accounts because the clearing houses require them to. 

So depending on how you initially deposit (initiated at broker, wire, initiated at bank, bill pay ect.) it can take 4 to 44 days to get cleared before you can shuffle that money on linked accounts via internal instant transfers. I think online bill pay is quickest with a credit hold of 4 days. ð",10,0.92,1534635762,"[['ACH', 1]]",ACH,10.119999885559082,10.510000228881836

t3_9dovlp,How should I approach this particular trade tomorrow?,"Hello everyone, I am fairly new to trading but am learning as I go along.

I currently have 300 shares with AMD @ 28.10 each, I would like to sell them at $28.50 or more tomorrow and repurchase with the same amount of money at $27.40 or less.


After looking at the last two days of trading I've seen that AMD stock can go as low as $27.19 and as high as $29.39, although today it only went as high as $28.58.


Overall the trend is going up and would like to capitalize on the pyramid (I think I'm using this term right?).


How should I approach this?  Should I set a Sell Limit order of my existing 300 shares at $28.10 for $28.40 (or more) or should I use a different trade order type such as stop or stop limit?  Still somewhat unclear what stop limit is as my understanding of stop is simply that I would like to purchase at X price and in case if it falls at set Y price then it will automatically sell for me right?


And stop limit is more or less a stop but not entirely precise?  Why would I want that?



Also in terms of selling orders, if I want to sell the 300 shares at @28.50 then how will a stop differ from a limit?

- I bought some GERN shares today when the charts showed it was at 6.32 value using the ""MKT"" order type. When I checked the share value in the monitor tab, it showed that I had bought the shares at 6.44 value instead. It rose to that value some minutes later, therefore I decided to sell them so I would be mostly +/-0 using ""MKT"" once again. This time it showed that I had sold them at 6.22 value. What did I do wrong?

- Is there a way to see how many shares there are available to short sell at any time?

- Recommended local broker with good commission prices uses Trading Work Station as its trading platform. Does anyone have any experiece with it? The demo account requires a 3000 â¬ deposit, so I'd like to hear others opinions first.

t3_9gmqzu,A month of Profits,"I posted that I would show a month of profits on Imgur.  Here is the link to my original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/98e255/i_will_show_a_month_of_my_profits_on_imgur/

Now the month is over and every day I traded the profits are posted with the date regardless of the profit at the end of the day.  The point of me doing this is to prove that day trading is not only possible, but someone on this subreddit manages to successfully do it.  That means ANY ONE OF YOU trying can do this as well.  For anyone that may wonder, this my 10th year trading, it took 6 years for me to become consistently profitable.  The reason it took me that long is because I kept searching for the right service or chat room to tell me when to buy and sell.  I wasn't learning how to trade on my own, instead I wanted someone else to do the work for me.  That won't work as a trader.  You have to put in the time and effort and lose the money necessary to learn how to do this for a living.  It's that simple.  The hard part is not losing all your money before becoming profitable.

To answer a few questions that will probably come up.  How I trade, I trade stocks between 10-100 dollars.  I am primarily a long side trader.  I screen for stocks using trade ideas that trade a minimum of 1 million shares per day and I trade short quick bursts in the stocks.  Usually my position size is 1000-3000 shares.  That's it.  No Vwap, no MACD, no RSI, no elliot waves and so on.  My win percentage over the entire month was 66.2 percent.

For some reason when you look at my profile on IMGUR some of the posts do not show up anymore.  I guess that is from down votes.  So I will link each day individually.  Sorry for that.

I was trading OGEN earlier this morning and got wrecked. 

Good thing it was small size but I'm a bit frustrated because I don't really understand what happened here. I don't mind losing, but there is almost always a decent explanation. This time, I just couldn't quite see it.

I've placed a 1 min, 5min, and daily chart in the link above. The crash happened from 1.27 all the way down to about .97! The volume on the 5 min candle was about 1.3 million. Now here's the thing, I was looking at the level 2 and the Time and Sales and there was no indication whatsoever of this. Normally, there might be a big seller sitting on the ask or maybe even a hidden one but things seemed pretty normal... then BOOM!

I traded the bottom of the bull flag that formed in the 5min chart a few minutes before (got in near the bottom at around 1.19 so as it was going up I was  strictly paying attention to the level 2 and Time/sales). 

I can only guess that there was maybe a hidden seller that I simply did not catch. Or maybe the bullflag pattern didnt have enough strength to continue up and everyone decided to sell? Or could it have been a big seller just sold on the market not the bid/ask? Either way, I figured it would have trended down a bit slower but this move was pretty massive and happened in about 1 millisecond. It was as if the red candle just spawned there. It's not like I havnt seen massive red candles before that have come down extremely fast. It's just that they usually have a lot of selloffs in the time and sales or have a huge seller sitting on the ask. This one in particular just didn't sit well with me and was wondering if anyone can provide some clarity.",2,1.0,1539294984,"[['OGEN', 2]]",OGEN,1.2300000190734863,1.2200000286102295

**Introduction:** I'm c0tt0nc4ndyTA and I'm a day trader that's had great success in      this  field for many years. My path was to be an Architect; I spent  9     years  in university studying computer sciences for the first 6   years,    and then  my masters in architecture for the remaining. During   my    studies I fell  in love with day trading, and quickly let the   student in    me consume any  book I could get my hands on while going   on a  shopping   spree of online  courses. For years I refined my   talents and  switched  my  career direction  to day-trading. I focus   mainly on Crypto   Currencies  as the ethos of  Libertarianism aligns   with my beliefs.  This  would  consciously allow me  to day-trade as a   career.

&#x200B;

**My objective:** I'm reaching out to communities to let them know I've started an      online  journey to train people for free. I want to take my years of      knowledge  and refinement to create a free course that give the new      generation of  traders a fighting chance at success, and the ability  to    learn the core  mechanics of trading, which I believe function  heavily    in psychology and discipline.

&#x200B;

**Why Free?:**       I have a real problem with the training industry in it's current      state.  I've spent many thousands of dollars on my journey to  becoming a      professional. I've seen literally hundreds of courses,  ads,   websites,  people on social media, or marketing spots trying to  take   advantage of    people by offering something along the lines of  this:

""I've      taught thousands of  people how to make millions of dollars and you    can   join my course  for only $2,000"" or "" Want to be your own boss  and   make   up to  $2,500 a day? start here by taking my course and  learning   the  best   killer strategies for only $300.00 a month""

The       amount of ""pay to learn how to trade"" material out there is      staggering,  and it has become the new way to angle shoot people for      profits. Almost  sort of a new age form of scamming. The funny part is      most of these  paid for courses or materials are a very poor form of      trading, some  rehash of fib levels, regurgitated strategies that   simply    don't work, or  some form of ""enter at C for insane mad easy     guaranteed  profits"". It's  pure crap, and there's not enough real     training out  there. In my time I  have seen close friends, many     acquaintances online  and in person, and  strangers fall into this trap     of spending over  $25,000.00 at times on  these materials that simply     don't work. They  then lose money after  spending absorbent amounts  of    money trying to  learn to become a  professional trader.

&#x200B;

**What do I expect?:** Absolutely nothing. I do this to give people a fighting chance at learning institutional level trading. My content is 100% free, I devote a lot of my time every week to create a platform where people (beginners and advanced) can learn how to trade, and refine their skills. I  upload  three videos a week on youtube, I do live lessons  in    discord, I  openly  receive questions and feedback, and I post  charts on trading  view for  people to get in on the same trades I'm  already   in  on. I can't  stress  enough that this is free. There is no  types  of   hidden  memberships, paid  bonuses, back-end dealings, pump  and  dumps  of  any  kind, or anything even  closely resembling me  taking  money for   some type  of service. The only  thing I ~~expect~~ **want** is for people to tune in and learn!

&#x200B;

**Whose this for?:**       Everyone! It doesn't matter if you're a beginner, or an advanced trader. It doesn't matter if you trade the Forex, Crypto, Bonds, Derivatives, or other. This material will be applicable to you. I  focus primarily on the crypto markets.

t3_9vb8wo,+$499 Day Trading Review. 8 Nov 18,"Help me learn! Maybe help others learn! If feedback is positive, im going to try to do this everyday.

I learned based from Andrew Aziz's chatroom and books. I like his style and it does OK for me. I work a day job and only have 30 minutes to an hour to trade per day. The idea is to get in, make some money and get out. Staying in the market brings additional risk that i can't afford.

I started with a $30K account, dropped to a $26K and then made it back up to around $29K before making a really bad trade losing $3K. That knocked me down and ive been struggling to get back up. Since then ive been mostly doing simulator trading trying to find my groove again. Watch my other youtube trades to see how poorly its been recently.

&#x200B;

So here is my day for 8 Nov. Let me know what you see. I would love input on how to get better.

Started my day looking over gapper stocks and creating a watchlist. Then had to get my son ready for day care and came back to my computer at 0934. In the video you can hear Andrew talking about his trades. Ive found i get FOMO if i listen to him and dont think about my own trades so i muted him after a few minutes.

I quickly looked through my watchlist and settled on ROKU. Strategy was a 5 minute opening range breakout. The one minute looked like it dropped then bounced back a bit to VWAP (blue line) and the 9 EMA before trending down slightly. I went short 250 shares and followed with another 500 shares when it made a new 1 minute low. Stop was a new 1 minute high around $51. After that i covered in quarters of my position starting at the daily low and then phasing out as it dropped. I planned on exiting fully if it made a new 1 minute high. I had a support level from the daily chart drawn at about $48.8 that i thought it was going to bounce off and i only had 58 shares level so i exited the rest of the position.

Things to think about. ROKU was on a short selling restriction and DAS doesn't do a good job with that in the sim. There would have been a good chance that i didn't get my position filled right when i went short.

I could have also stayed in the position and then added more at the pull back to VWAP around 0953 but I had made my money by then and didn't want to risk what I already had. Greed is what killed my account in the first place.

t3_9vlf02,-$4.45 Day Trading Review. 9 Nov 18,"Help me learn, help others learn!

&#x200B;

This was not my day. Emotional with lots of rushed over trading. Right at the start, i didn't really like any of my watchlist. Which i have noticed as a trend. If i dont like the watchlist then i trade poorly. Its been harder to act on and keep my self restrained on those days though.

&#x200B;

Up $46 but after commissions, I'm -$4.45. Ill take it after the disaster that was the rest of the day.

&#x200B;

First trade: Short SLS 1000 Shares, -$60

This was chasing plain and simple. I saw the price drop after the first 5 minutes and rationalized the trade by saying that it had closed below the 50 SMA on the 1 minute and the 9 EMA on the 5 minute. Which was all true and actually the 1 minute shows that even though it broke the average slightly, it dropped back down. I just had a crap entry. A better entry may have been the break of VWAP.

&#x200B;

Trades 2/3/4: DBX Long 250, then short 250, then long 1250, -$67.50, -$27.50, -$7.50

Price broke and closed above VWAP on the 5 and 1 minute charts with a higher high/higher low trend. I went long but quickly got out after the price dropped quickly closing below VWAP again. My thought was a reversal so i went short 250 shares just before the price quickly rose and i got out again. I then went long 250 shares as it made a new high on the 1 minute then added 1000 as it made a new 5 minute high. Around this time i had to help my wife. The price dropped but i wasn't paying attention and honestly i would have exited. But it rose back up and i got out around break even.

&#x200B;

Trade 5: Long SLS 3000 shares, -$160

Price was climbing back up after an initial sell off at the open and my plan was to go long to VWAP then hopefully higher. Again the price went against me and i was forced out.

&#x200B;

Trade 6: Short ATVI 1000 shares, +$369.14

Price had bounced back to the averages and was chopping around slightly on the 1 minute. The 5 minute never broke the average and actually dropped a bit but hovered right at $54. Looking at level 2 a saw a few big bids around 53.95 that led me to believe the price might go down to those or lower if we could break $54. I went short and covered in quarters. Covering my last bit as i saw the price rise back up slightly.

One big trade on AMD and two small trades.

LIVE: [https://youtu.be/iP5pxOpe7cg](https://youtu.be/iP5pxOpe7cg)

&#x200B;

Short AMD 1750. Initially went for a 5 minute ORB but stopped out as it made a new 1 minute high. After i saw it couldn't break the VWAP and level 2 hinted at weakness, i went short 1750 shares and covered in quarters of my position. As you can see i probably could have stayed in longer but profit is profit and im not complaining. This is still a great example of something i have been struggling with. I tend to take profit as i see it rather then wait for level and targets. The debate of take small profits i know vs potential large profits i dont know is hard. One thing i learned and use is that once a trade is profitable i dont let it go against me. Meaning if i take profits, i get out at breakeven rather than take a loss. Sometimes this means getting out when i should have stay in or added. But i feel like its worth it most the time.

&#x200B;

I played briefly with two others with small positions but about then my son was up and i was profitable. I would rather go hang with him.

t3_9wahzv,RSI & MacD,"Hi, Redditors! This is the indicator post that I promise to upload 2 weeks ago! hope you all enjoy it, if you have any question feel free to ask and give me your feedback too :) we all can learn from each other.

## RSI (Relative Strength Index)

RSI measures the speed and change in price movement â There are 4 points in total but you only have to look out for 2 which is the 30 and the 70.

https://preview.redd.it/9o0l67jxmtx11.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=68dcf6811303b4ce87ea7edee0760f1b1bd532c4

When the market is ABOVE the 70 marks, it is considered overbought. On the other hand, when the market is BELOW the 30 marks, it is considered oversold.

&#x200B;

The green circles in this image are areas that are oversold, the majority of the traders will be looking for a buy entry around areas like this. The red circles are areas that are overbought and traders will be looking for a sell entry.

&#x200B;

Traders commonly use RSI with support and resistance lines to look for trade entries. As you can see in the image below: Green lines are Support and Resistance lines and the Vertical white lines are lines indicating when the market is above 70 marks or below 30 marks.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8n0jun6ymtx11.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=97c407ad7f6e60465ca113975cba760ea3fa8da7

## MacD (Move average Convergence and Divergence Oscillator)

&#x200B;

MACD turns two trend-following indicators,Â [moving averages](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages), into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average (26) from the shorter moving average (12). As a result, the MACD offers the best of both worlds:Â **trend following and momentum.** ([https://stockcharts.com/](https://stockcharts.com/))

So all you need to know is that the MacD measures the momentum of the market and traders use this momentum to look for entries.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5oiqprnymtx11.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a8754ad45053890ddd14955b2d8f1a5dcc5b18

In this example, you can see how the resistance line and MacD divergence work hand in hand. In the blue circles, you can see the resistance line (Green Line) tested by the market. Soon after, a divergence line (White line) is also formed by the MacD, which indicates a loss of momentum in the market.

Look at the two blue circles, even though they are about the same level, the MacD levels are very different and when the market broke the support line (Blue line) a downtrend was formed (Green circle)

&#x200B;

## HOW DO YOU COME ABOUT USING MACD?

Look at the market with similar levels (Blue circle) with a different level in MacD (Like the image above) When this occurs, there is a good chance that the market is currently losing momentum.

&#x200B;

## THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR WHEN TRADING WITH INDICATORS.

Take note that trading with indicators alone is not enough, what you want is a number of things that are aligned. For example, a strong support or resistance with a RSI that is on an overbought/oversold level or MacD with losing momentum. When these signs coincide, it is a very strong signal to enter traders.

t3_9xdimn,"+$80 Day Trading Review, 15 Nov 18","So today wasn't great but not terrible. The day started with a watchlist that i wasn't a fan of. Meh price action and volume. Nothing really seemed to stand out which ive found is a leading sign of a bad day.

LIVE: [https://youtu.be/WqUxI3Wy7Io](https://youtu.be/WqUxI3Wy7Io)

First trade: NBEV 6000 shares short. NBEV dropped and pulled back to the 9 EMA but i noticed several large bids which led me to think it was going to drop back down. I went short 2000 shares then added another 2000 as it made a new 5 minute low. a minute later those big bids went away and the price spiked very quickly back to the average and it spooked me a bit. It didn't stay there long and i stay in. Then i saw those big bids come back and i added another 2000 shares bringing my average to around 3.438. The price dropped to 3.40 and i sold a quarter before it pulled back and then dropped again. The speed changes were happening freaked me out a bit and i got out when it dropped back to 3.41. I could have stayed, i should have stayed but my emotions got the best of me . I still walked away with about $190. Probably should have ended there.

&#x200B;

Next two trades were AMD. One short for 1000 and the other long for 1000. AMD dove hard from daily highs and broke the vwap and previous day close. I was afraid it might bounce but I went short after it closed below on the 1 minute and added more a little later. Profit target was the 5 minute 50 SMA then low of the day. My wife needed help getting the kid ready so i setup a stop loss and walked away. Came back to find it had indeed bounced off the close and was on its way back up. My last trade was really quick long before i decided i was just losing the gain made on the first trade and it wasn't getting better. So i quickly exited and called it a day.

https://preview.redd.it/5l3via6ewiy11.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f17fe7486f12229c246c74c515651adcc826817d",5,0.65,1542304626,"[['NBEV', 2], ['AMD', 1]]",NBEV,3.6500000953674316,4.25
t3_9x7ilb,"+$3350 Day Trading Review, 14 Nov 18","So this was unexpected. I guess i left a position of AMD open yesterday and closed it out this morning for around $3400. Not much really to say expect double check your positions before you log off. This could have easily gone the other way.

t3_9yfy9a,Volume Divergence on MMM ?,"I'm new to this sub and to day trading in general. I've been spending quite some time understanding technical analysis. Can ya'll tell me if I'm reading this right.

If you look at the $MMM 1 year chart you can see that after the low of October 22nd price started moving up pretty rapidly, however the rate of change of volume is still pretty stagnant (bottom most chart). I have read that increase in price without volume confirmation is a good sign of a bull trap. Is this correct analysis here ?

t3_a08ly2,A real world analogy for shorting.,"I remember when I was first starting out I knew that you could click the sell button before the buy button to short, essentially giving you the ability to buy low and sell high but in the reverse order, but I never knew how it worked.

You have a buddy who owns an xbox and you ask if you can borrow it. He lends you his xbox and you immediately sell it online for $200. Six months later your buddy wants his xbox back. Well now since the system is a bit older, you can buy one online for $180, so you do so, give the xbox back to your friend, and pocket $20. You have effectively sold high and then bought low by borrowing.

You can also take this analogy further to explain options, and the premium you would pay your friend to allow you to buy the xbox for the agreed upon $200 the xbox is worth today, at any point in the next X months. In that example you would say a new xbox exclusive was speculated to drop by the end of the year and xbox sales would surge.",12,0.88,1543153789,"[['X', 1]]",X,24.799999237060547,24.219999313354492

I made 3 trades today on 2 stocks: MU and CVS.

First Trade: CVS long 500 shares. I have a rule that I don't trade in the first 5 minutes. On this first trade i broke that slightly trading about 30-40 seconds early. I saw CVS climb then drop back busting the 9 and 20 EMAs but get bought back up above the 9. Feeling that i had support from the moving averages and seeing the price get bought back up, i felt the buyers were with me and i went long 500 shares. My first profit target was the high of day which i hit fairly quickly. After that, the price dropped back and i tried to setup a stop-loss at or just below break-even but screwed up the buttons and sold the rest of my position.

Second Trade: CVS Long 500 shares. After exiting my previous position, i saw that the 9 EMA again looked to be holding as support and i went long 500 shares after a new 1 minute high. First profit target was again high of day and then continuing to scale out every minute or so after. I finally exited the position after a solid break of the 9 EMA.

Third Trade: MU long 500 shares. My strategy for MU was a 5 minute opening range breakout. After seeing the price bust the 200 and 50 SMA, i felt that it was going to continue falling. This idea was backed up after it dropped through previous day close. I scaled out of the position at various levels and exited the remainder after making 3 new 1 minute highs.

**Summary -** overall a decent day. After a solid gain on AMZN I made sure all my trades are fairly small to preserve the gains. Since I do mostly scalping I rarely look at PM gappers. Today I joined  discord and got sucked in by the hype. AEMD and OGEN are the result. From my experience PM trading is rarely an indicator of how security will trade during regular hours, but PM gappers are good to review in late afternoon.

I have had incredible success pretending I have $1000 with 4:1 leverage as they offer. I am taking 90% BP position sizes and only trading confident breakout patterns and the occasional short on confirmed over extensions.

1. **Is it generally easy to short stocks if you're day trading with \~$20k?** I know to short a stock, there must be shares available through the institution/brokerage. So I'm wondering if it's generally easy to short a downward trending stock for the day through a major broker like E-Trade or TD Ameritrade.  

2. **Are you charged an interest rate** if you don't hold overnight? Are the rates high? I've read that for each stock, there is an interest rate attached, but I get the impression this is mainly if you were to hold over the course of many days / months.  

3. Is the process automated, quick and easy like buying stocks normally?

Welp, fastforward a few months and Iâve averaged $4200 each month with December being my most profitable so far with $6233 (I bought many puts). 

What I do is I draw support and resistance on SPY 1hr/2hr, 15min, and 1min charts and then use bollinger bands and the main MAs (50, 100, 200) that everyone uses. I trade death crosses, bollinger band contractions, and sometimes if Iâm feeling cocky or just âone with the force,â bollinger band traveling. I only trade SPY as to âeliminateâ business specific risk so I donât have to worry about random reports of CEOs raping somebody or other drama. Macro events are relatively predictable and I always wait for the market to respond to them...I NEVER take trades anticipating the resulting direction of jobs reports, FOMC meetings, etc. I only buy calls or puts with extreme gamma and delta ratios, AKA expiring literally the day of or the next day.

t3_aaqf54,The Wash Sale Rule (don't worry about it) and taxes,"***Disclaimer:*** *I am not a financial adviser. I do not do tax forms professionally. This post is a result of my own math and doing my own taxes on a loss (including wash sales) for a year. If any of it is incorrect, it's not my fault if you report the wrong numbers to the IRS. By reading this post you waive the right to sue me for providing false information. However, to the best of my ability I will provide my opinion of the correct information.*

* * *

It's Schedule D (Capital Gains taxes), and form 8949. Pub 550 has more info. I've attached images of the relevant sections.

[In effect, the wash sale (disallowed loss)'s cost gets added to your next trade's cost basis.](https://imgur.com/a/O70qtBT)

In the example given in Pub 550, a trader buys with a cost basis of $1000 and sells for $750, a loss of $250. Within the next 30 days the trader buys shares in the same stock for $800. This means the $250 lost from the previous trade is disallowed under wash sale rule. So in effect, your new trade starts with a cost basis of $1050. If you'll notice, that's effectively saying that you are starting this trade with a loss of $250. It doesn't keep stacking and stacking until you have to pay taxes on a million.

Let's see what happens on the next trade. If the next trade is also a loss of $200 (sells the 800 for 600) then the total loss is now $450. The next trade is entered with $1000 cost basis, so the disallowed losses from wash sales is added to this cost basis, to make this trade's basis $1450. The next trade profits $100 by selling the $1000 at $1100. So overall, the tax situation now looks like there is a $350 loss, but actually that isn't claimable for taxes. The account is down $350, so the trader hasn't profited yet. And the disallowed loss is $450.

What if the wash sale rule didn't apply to any of these trades?

Well, the trader could claim a $350 loss on taxes. This is capped to $1500 or $3000 per year depending on your filing status. But if you lose more than that in a year, then you can carry it over to the following years. If you for example lose 5k in the first year and you can only claim $3k loss for taxes, then the next year you make 10k, you can carry over the other 2k loss from the first year, and claim profits of only 8k, paying taxes on that, instead of the 10k.

The way it's worded, it really doesn't fuck you unless you're using a wash sale to artificially reduce your year's profits, which can't really happen in the case of an overall loss.

If you profit on the year, the wash sales will be disallowed losses, but your account will also be green. So let's continue the example.

The account is now down $350 with $450 in disallowed losses. If the account continues losing, then each loss will be added to the disallowed loss column. The profits will reduce the account's loss by whatever the profit is, but if the wash sale rule continues to apply (say the trader only trades SPY all year, for example) then the disallowed loss will continue to accumulate. However, that doesn't really matter in terms of capital gains taxes, because you're not taxed on losses!

But as you can see, if the account goes green, then the trader might have, say, 1000 in profits, with 1500 in disallowed losses, because the profits and disallowed losses are both accumulating. But the account itself is in the green with 1000 profits. The disallowed losses (wash sale rule) is there so that the trader can't claim to have lost $500 overall, when actually the account profited $1000.

I know it's a bit complicated but if you work out the numbers, you'll see that it's actually very fair to the average trader.",7,1.0,1546127047,"[['D', 1]]",D,71.08999633789062,72.38999938964844

Started the day with a 500 share short on JD after about 10 minutes. After some up and down the first 10 minutes, it looked like it had settled below the vwap and was ready to move down. I went short with a profit target of low of the day and a stop right above vwap and a new 5 minute high. Got stopped out as planned.

JD LONG  
After i got stopped out the price closed above the vwap on the 1 minute with fairly bullish candle. The 5 minute now showed a new 5 minute high and the previous 5 minute candle showed the price had dropped then been bought back up towards vwap. I felt this was a bullish sign and went long 250 shares. as the price dropped towards vwap a bit i added 100 shares twice for a total of 450. Profit target again was high of the day or a new 5 minute low/drop below vwap.... and thats what happened. Eventually JD did end up rising towards 23.55 but i was done with it by that point.

AMD LONG  
AMD sank pretty hard at the open but then started popping up towards vwap. At 10:06 it looked like it was consolidating around the 9 & 20 EMAs. I decided to go long 500 shares. First profit target was the 1 minute 50 SMA and then, then 5 minute 20 EMA followed by high of the day. It popped as expect and i sold a quarter of my position at the 1M 50 SMA. after that it sank and dropped below vwap. With a new 5 minute low, and as i had already taken profit and didn't want to give any back, i exited. 

AMD SHORT  
The price dropped and closed below vwap on the 5 minute. The 1 minute looked as if the price was struggling to break the 1M 50 SMA. I went short 500 shares with a target of low of the day. I added another 500 as it continued to sit right below the average. I was trying to buy as close to vwap/the MA as possible. Stop was above vwap. And it broke out and from there rose to 19.8. 

Overall im down about -$178 after commissions and super frustrated. Today felt good. It felt like i was doing the right things at the right times. Looking back, there were so many other things i could have focused on. I pulled AAL up and thought about going long but didn't because i was already in AMD and sure enough it would have been a way better trade. 

For the AMD long trade... if i had just stayed in. It had a brief drop below my original entry but i think i would have stayed since it was quick. Always easy to look back with regret but its hard to see in the moment. 

As always, i appreciate any feedback you all might have.

t3_ag206m,Seeking flat table real-time and historical online information.,"I've been lurking for a couple of weeks, and I've read the FAQs, and I haven't seen what I was looking for.

I have a fairly strong background in real-time data analysis as well as other sets of mathematics. I'm aware of the risks, and I don't plan to risk more than I can afford.  I have a thinkorswim account, and I also have an E\*Trade account. 

However, I have a few metrics that I've devised (which I assume have been developed and discarded by smarter people than me) and an algorithm that I want to demo first before taking it live.  I'm looking for an online system that has the following characteristics for one to many tickers available in flat text files:

* Historical pricing (bid/ask) and trading volumes at roughly minute intervals for the last year. Basically all the numbers you see on a thinkorswim chart.
* A good, functional demo station that let's me test the algorithms before actually spending money (I see this on thinkorswim as paper money, E\*Trade calls it a sandbox).
* Relatively easy to implement API (I plan to learn Python for this).

I'm aware that what I'm asking may seem foolish to some, but I'm curious from an intellectual standpoint to see if there would be trends for me to identify.  If it works, who knows, maybe I'll reach out to others on it.

Any thoughts are welcome, and thanks in advance.

t3_ag3tnr,$1500 on ES in 15 minutes. Day three of my OneUp Evaluation for $250k account. Here's the video anybody interesting in me keeping up to date on getting a funded account with OneUp?,"Hey guys. So I decided to switch from TopStep to OneUp. So I'm doing the OneUp evaluation right now for their $250k funded account. I'm on day three and I've been recording my trading sessions.

I lost $3,000 on the first day because I was trying to set the whole damn thing up with my trading software of choice to sync correctly with their records...etc. But now on the 3rd day I made it all back and am officially in profit. I expect to be funded by the end of the month (that's my goal anyway).

Here's the my screen recording of my trading session for day three (I accidentally did my first trade on a demo account -- not OneUp -- so you'll see me acknolwedge that. Lucky for me it was a losing trade and my rest were winners hah hah).

[https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cqV22K3lKv](https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cqV22K3lKv)

I know this setup and what's happening on the screen may be VERY different from what stock traders are used to (or even other Futures traders).

If you're wondering how I'm making my entry decisions I can also explain that in a video (if you would like).

Please let me know if you would like me to make a video explaining my setup and my ""trading station"" (which is just a laptop and two USB screens as I am one of those ""digital nomads.""

To be evaluated by OneUp cost me $650 (and it will cost $100 per account reset if I hit a $5,000 max loss on the day or week or a $5,500 max trailing draw down) and it will cost $650 a month until I get funded (which is why I want to get funded by the end of the month).

I can trade a max of 25 contracts under the $250k account, but I'm sticking with 10.

I have a programmed bracket order that has a 6-tick trailing stop, take profit on 7 contracts at 6 ticks, then leaves the remaining 3 contracts on to trail in case the price runs.

t3_agf42m,What is price action trading methodology? Read this to find out.,"MOST RECENT  POST 1/16/19

Iâd like to make this into a thread for others to learn about what price action trading is. I mainly trade the /es. I sometimes trade forex. I will add as much as possible to this thread in the most organized way possible.

**1/15/2019 ENTRY**

**. WHAT IS A MARKET?**

A market is a place where many individuals come together in order to find the best price possible for anything. Anything can be exchanged on a market. You can go to a farmers market nearby and you would ultimately be engaged in a market that is almost the same as buying and selling on the stock market.  Everyone is trying to sell something and buy something  for the best price possible. In terms of trading, you can buy and sell a variety of stuff. For example, currencies, stocks, futures contracts. You can even buy corn, soy beans, livestock, and oil on the futures market. Youâd be surprised with everything that you are able to trade on the market. You are simply trying to buy or sell any given thing at the best price possible.

Why do markets exist?

Once again, markets are trying to find the best price possible. Markets exist in order to avoid being ripped off. Letâs look at some examples.

Example one is that you are trying to buy a house. You will go door-to-door asking people if they will sell you their house. Eventually you will find a house. That person will know that no one else is trying to sell a house. Since they do not feel any competition in selling, they will sell you the house at a very expensive price.

Now letâs look at situation two. You are attempting to sell your house. Imagine that a realtor did not exist. You would have to go door-to-door asking people if they wanted to buy your house. People would know that there is not a demand or a need to buy your house, so they would offer you  the cheapest price possible.

In both of these situations, there is a middle man that could help avoid selling at the incorrect price or buying at the incorrect price. In the housing market, this is called a realtor. In trading , this is called a broker.

The job of the realtor is to find people that want to buy a house and people that want to sell a house. This will help with finding the correct house market value for the area where you live.

The job of a broker is to find people that want to buy a stock or sell a stock. The more people that are trying to buy or sell the stock, the closer that the stock will be to fair market value.

Trading markets and brokers  solely exist for the reason of finding Many people that want to buy and sell on the market. This will in the end help find the best price possible for whatever you are trying to trade.

**Chart types and bar types**

&#x200B;

**Chart types**

There are a variety of different ways to graph the way that price moves around while the market is open.  Remember the only reason why we are at the market is in order to get the best price possible. A graph has two axis. The X axis, and the Y axis.

Remember this from math class in high school? It's back to haunt you again lol.

The X axis (the horizontal bottom part of the graph can  show us time, volume, range, or ticks. You are probably most familiar with time. This is where a bar is formed every X given time interval. For example, if you are looking at a 1 hour chart, the X axis will print a bar every 1 hour. There are also more chats like the tick chart. The tick chart will print a bar every x given ticks. For example, a 1000 tick chart will print a new bar on the chart every 1000 ticks. What is a tick? It is simply a a movement of price. Look at a bar chart on a one minute time frame. During the one minute when a bar is forming, it is moving up and down. Each up and down movement is a tick. a 1000 volume chart will form a new bar when 1000 shares are bought or sold.

The Y-axis (vertical line on the side of the graph), is basically price. Price tends to move in .25 cent intervals for future indices, pipettes in Forex, and .01 cents in stocks. Time charts, volume charts, tick charts, range charts. There are all showing the same y- axis, but the interval on the x-axis changes. None is better than the other. It is all personal preference and risk management. I'll get more into this later. For now, i'd stick to a 1,3, or 5 minute chart if I were to be day trading.

&#x200B;

**Bar types**

&#x200B;

There are many different types of bars. A bar can range from a bar, candle, line, to point and figure. I mainly use candles on a 5 minute graph. The benefit of bar and candle is that they show the open high low and close of the time period on the x-axis. The line graph only shows the closing price. There are tons of websites that teach how to read the basics of these bars for free. You should learn how to read their open, high, low, and close. LEARN THIS BEFORE YOU KEEP READING.

&#x200B;

Many websites show Japanese candle sticks as having many types of names based on the shape that they make in relation to the bars next to them. This can work for some people, but I personally do not use them. I do not see how  naming a pattern that a bar makes will help me get a win in the market.

&#x200B;

A bar can be used to its most maximum and basic ability by indicating if its in a trend or range bar.  A trend is basically when a market is going up or down with higher highs and lower lows ( more on this later). A range is basically when a market is not going up or not going down. It is just going side ways. (more on this later).

&#x200B;

Here are some examples.

&#x200B;

[Trending bar](https://imgur.com/a/q2Jek1J)

This bar is from a 5 minute chart. You can see it opened on its on its high, it then went down and closed on its low. The bar did not have any wicks or tails on it. This is indicating that on a lower time frame (e.g. 1 minute) there is a strong trend down.

&#x200B;

[Consolidation bar](https://imgur.com/a/S5TSx4o)

&#x200B;

This bar is from a 5 minute chart. Here you can see that the bar had a small body, and very large wicks. This is a Consolidation bar. On a lower time frame the market simply went sideways. It went up and down for 5 minutes. It then closed close to where it opened.

&#x200B;

For me this is all I need to know about bars. I don't memorize bar names or any thing fancy like that. All I care about is if the market is trending or if the market is consolidating.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To wrap up charts, there are a few different types of chart types and bar types. I also introduced you to a basic understanding of consolidating markets, and trending markets. Also how you can see if it is consolidating or trending by just looking at a bar. I like to use candle sticks, and 5 minute charts.

I'm also looking for some bot for crypto trading. I've done my research, and mostly websites and forums reccomend bots like HaasBot, CryptoTrader, GunBot, CryptoHopper, ProfitTrailer, 3Commas (and some others)... There are 6-10 bot names, that they are repeating. But these are too expensive for me, as I'm rather playing with trading and learning all the stuff.

I don't invest large amount of money, so I'm looking for rather cheap bot. Basically, most of my needs is just **Trailing Stop Loss** and **integrated charts** for coin pairs. And Binance integration with optional Kraken and Bitstamp.

I know there's free Gekko bot ([https://www.coinbureau.com/education/gekko-trading-bot/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbureau.com%2Feducation%2Fgekko-trading-bot%2F&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AFQjCNGQKHQz9702QH-VT2qBeGDMxH0X0A) | [https://gekko.wizb.it/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgekko.wizb.it%2F&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AFQjCNFl0KMRXys2jhxNPotV1yPHBVDnWg)), but it seems rather complicated for me to set it up and then coding in order to develop & run some actions. For now, with my current ""no free time"" scheme, Gekko is no-go.

I've came across TT ([https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/resources/labs/tt-crypto/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradingtechnologies.com%2Fresources%2Flabs%2Ftt-crypto%2F&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AFQjCNHujoSTzdt6lVYiyhP4483vRiq6gw)), but it seems kind of shady for me: no crypto website wrote about it, as far as I've been doing my research. Beside that, TT operate only on GDAX/Coinbase Pro.

So, finally, I've landed on this site - Margin.de: [https://margin.de/features](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmargin.de%2Ffeatures&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AFQjCNEQS48CcSeCmTzO0W17td0AYv81bg) (formelly Leonardo), which seems to have good reputation overall, it's visually nice and it's $89 **lifetime** license, so totally acceptable for me.

Question is - is it any good and trusted?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I'm not expecting to have 1000% ROI in 7 days. Basically I need automation tool rather than complete strategy bot, which will do everything for me. I want to play with exchange, test my strategies, without placing, editing, deleting my orders manually. 

For  now, I'm putting little ""scalping"" orders on Binance, and I'm having  like 4-7% income on BTC pairs. But putting them manually via exchange  website is difficult and frustrating and I want to automate it. Not to  mention, that I have to look over the charts ""by hand"" in order to keep  up with current prices and also Binance/Kraken/Bitstamp don't have  Trailing Stop Losses...

Using finviz, I set Float Short at over 20% and RSI set to Oversold 40.  I also set the current volume at over 300k.  Not sure if I need to set 50SMA or 200SMA so I leave it blank.  I usually set micro-cap (under 300m) and price under $30.

If I can add to this screening approach or learn an entirely new one, that would be very helpful.

Been at it for a year and I'm at a 65% success ratio.  However, I have yet to successfully anticipate during pre-market or the night before DD which stocks are primed to cause the shorts to cover.  All of my successes are based on scrambling around for the big gainers between 9:30 am and 10:30 am.  I do have a lot of intra-day chart knowledge, knowing when to buy and sell based on indicators, so if anyone has any questions I'd be happy to answer.

t3_awey5d,Shared progress & advice/tips?,"Hello traders, just wanted to share my progress after my first month of trading. I recently started learning about the stock market back in December and began educating myself, about the basics of trading both the fundamental and technical. Just like everyone else, I began with paper trading and used a realistic amount of capital to mimic actual trades. I started off rough, but began making consistent profits while adapting my strategy, practice trades. Enter January, I slowly transitioned to real trading using my capital of about 3k. Being honest, I thought that my transition would be smooth with little to no issues, but boy was I wrong. My first trade w/ JNUG, I entered with 1/5 of my capital (roughly 250) just to get a feel of it and was successful with a very small profit of about 0.75% lol.

&#x200B;

I eventually started scaling up my share sizes until my first red day where i lost $150 because of my foolish mistake of forgetting to set my stop loss. It hindered my confidence making me think to myself that this is not going to be how I planned it with paper trading. Within a few more weeks of trading, I've gained/lost about $20-50 and my capital growth didn't go more than 2% or roughly $3,050. My primary focus at the time was trading large size cap stocks where price action changes would vary, but soon i realized that even with profitable days, the shares I needed would have to be moderate or substantial to capitalize on any profit. I turned my focus to small-mid cap stocks, and with that attention, I started remodeling my strategy and changing my plans, entry/exits based on previous day activities, and any possible catalysts that could positively/negatively affect the tickers I watched.

Slowly, my change in strategy started bearing fruit, a few weeks back, I focused on stocks around 0.5-5 ranges, and comb through the previous day and pre-market for news or high volume activity, and sometimes, pre-market activity. My hard and different focused  showed last week when I traded ABHV with an entry of $4.39 and exit price of $4.79 and a stop loss of 3%. Stuck with the plan, waited, and left green with a total of $267.22 or about 8.5%. Fast forward earlier this morning, I applied the same strat after combing through the morning choosing my top picks for the day, caught BPTH on my watch list, and just like before, another green day. entry was $4.79 and exit of $5.43. $369.48 profit for the day. It makes me happy knowing that while I do have a green day, I always return to paper trading using my actual capital as a simulation while back testing new strategies, or current/previous strategies in the market with ToS.

As I've slowly gotten accustomed to trading, the big factor that I've started to realize that affects traders is the mental, or psychological aspect of trading. When I enter a trade with x position, I start getting a mix of worry and euphoria watching the numbers fluctuate. There are times, that if I had waited patiently, I could have made about a 10-20% gain, but my emotions held me back and made me exit. Knowing full well that there was still a possibility that a ticker that I would watch can still continue running for certain based on factors such as news release/volume, EMA range, proper risk management, etc...

As a current novice trader still fresh in the market, what are your tips, thoughts that you could share that helped you get your mind focused on trading w/o having the emotional, or psychological part affect you? I'm certain that for myself, that is what I still need to focus on that can still be improved upon.",24,0.97,1551509063,"[['BPTH', 1]]",BPTH,2.6500000953674316,35.86000061035156

TradeZero offers free commission trades  which is a very big plus (based on how I trade, rarely I would sell on bid). Also, I had a quick question so I decided to call them, there was literally zero wait time and an agent picked up within seconds (this was during market open). However, I have heard so many complaints with their ZeroPro platform, especially with their charts and hotkeys too.

SureTrader's commissions are ""okay"" in my opinion. It is definitely far cheaper than my current broker, Questrade, where they charge $0.01/share. ST uses Das Trader which is the platform that everyone seems to be using and when it comes to creating your own specific hot keys, it's a no-brainer. Lastly, ST seems to charge fees on everything but I don't think I'll be affected too much from it.

Coming from the crypto world and bored with it currently. Backtested what I believe to be a proftable strategy and want to try my hand at this this. 

Going through the volume history, why is there no volume on March 6th this year. Theres no holiday according to CME calendar on the 6th. As well, it was a Wednesday. Google resulted in bupkus. 
Someone just showed me that on Rhithmic that it does show volume for the 6th. Who screwed up here? Tradingview or CQG. 

After research I decided upon AMP as my broker and CQG as my feed to Tradingview which I have been using for crypto for years. 
Why do they list $6000 on the AMP site as Maintenance margin set by CME but only $400 as day trade margin. So what do I send them? If I plan on being out before market close every day, do I really only ahve to send them basically $400 and never let it get less than that? So maybe $1-2k just to be on the safe side? Only if I stay in a trade over night I need to have $6000 with them? They dont list any night time margins so can I assume $6000 is my night time trade margin? Also on the home page of AMP they advertise as low as $300 ES day trade margin. But nowhere else on the site is that listed. Then I read on a forum for the $300 margin you pay a $9.60 RT. But again nowhere is that listed. Frustrating. Anyone know what the fee structure looks like?

Anyway, maybe itâs something that canât be beat, but Robinhoodâs lag is killing me. I try to enter limit prices far beyond the current price, but the execution is so slow it often fails to fill my sell orders.

t3_brjf76,"I get better prices with market orders, why use limit orders?","&#x200B;

I've been trying my hand at intra-day day trading, usually on pull backs on stocks with 9 to 20 dollars share price. At least 200K volume. I don't hold long, typically 1 to 30 minutes. I do 6 to 8 trades per day, anywhere between 20K to 40K dollars orders.

&#x200B;

If I place a market order (using TD Ameritrade) on a stock with a 9.86/9.87 bid and ask, and, for example 4000 share size, I will typically get a price between 9.86 and 9.87. So, I might get a 9.866 purchase price. Yes, sometimes I will see slippage, the market maker might give a partial fill at 9.87 and then more at 9.875, but not on the vast majority of the market orders.

&#x200B;

4000 x .0033 = 13.2 dollars.

&#x200B;

I essentially just paid for my commission fees with those fractions of cents. If I had placed a limit order for 9.87, I would guarantee the price, but I would lose out on the fractional cents that paid for the trade. I'm just not seeing enough slippage to force me to use limit orders.

&#x200B;

The math also works the same on the sell. I rarely sell at the bid: it's usually between the bid and the ask.

So, why use limit orders?

Long story short, I'm a young dude (22) prior service Army guy, got out of the Army, got a job training dogs (pets, protection dogs, search and rescue, tracking, etc) and within the past week I have quit that job for good due to witnessing the owner neglect and legitimately beat dogs. Pissed me off, tried to fix it, she's an alcoholic so it didn't change anything, so myself along with the ENTIRE group of every single other person who worked with us... Straight up just left lol. We are now in the process of opening up our own training company, which I will be a partial owner of. However, I now have no form of income. 

I've been swing trading over the past couple months because day/swing trading has caught my eye since I was roughly 19. I have $4,000.00 USD in a Robinhood account where I make all of my trades, I do all of my technical analysis on TDAmeritrade's Thinkorswim App. I have a basic knowledge on pretty much every commonly used indicator and how to apply them. I currently use the the 20 day SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD, OBV, CCI, and Stochastic Oscillators to pick my trades. I am $7500.00 (with leverage with Robinhood Gold) in a swing trade with GSKY right now as it looks like they are at a long term support level, their down trend is ending, the stochastic oscillators are pointing up, and it looks like the RSI is showing a bullish divergence compared to the chart. So I had a pretty good feeling about it. I bought in at 10.90. That's what I am involved in right now.

Could I even make a livable wage off of just starting swing trading 4k? 

My livable wage is roughly 2k a month. However, I am looking into getting a well paying part time job at least to cover my bills so that my interest accrued in my trades will just continue to compound and grow larger.

The first number is the ratio of dividend events where the (high - open) exceeds the dividend, meaning full recovery of the dividend amount occurred on the ex-div day (if you were to set a sell limit order). The second number is the average of (high - open) to the dividend amount. The third is the average of the (close - open) to the dividend amount.

The original strategy is intended to capture dividend recovery over 0-5 days, however this leads us open to ""what if the price doesn't recover?"" Since the majority of price recovery is typically on the ex-div date itself, I changed this to an intraday strategy of :

buy market on open > sell limit (open + dividend amount) > sell market on close if no fill

t3_bxv097,"Trading futures at the open, open discussion","Iâve been trading The CL, ES, and RTY right at the open and had a few questions.  Iâll start with the CL.  Although this is a 24 hour market, the US open is at 9am EST.  Thereâs always an opening drive either up or down at the open.  Iâve been tracking data since Feb â19 and Iâm trying to figure out what influences a move up or down right at the open.  

My strategy has been profitable, but still needs some work.  Thereâs typically an over night gap either up/down.  My data since feb shows more times than not the opening move is back towards yesterdayâs close(gap fill). But only about 55% of the time.  

Question 1: what/who is the force that determines which way the market will thrust at the open?

Question 2: are there any pre-market indicators which can tip off which way the market will move at the open?

The strategy that works for me now is using a 2 min chart,  2 contract sell stop a few ticks below the open when the market has gapped up over night, using a 6 tick stop and taking 1 contract at 10 ticks, and trailing the last contract at 15 ticks.  my risk is -12 ticks, and after the 1st target of 10 ticks, the last contract on trailer usually wins about  12 ticks.  At a 60% success rate, 1st contract usually averaged about +4 ticks and avg +8 for the trailer.  

Iâd like an open discussion with anyone trading the CL open and how I can make it better.  Any ideas on how to make this strategy better?  Any flaws you may see?

t3_bxr6ex,How do you handle stops on options? And can you use an option rollover when the stock changes direction?,"How do you handle stops on options?   Do you wait until there is some profit, then set a stop limit and manually step it up?   Or do you use trailing stops, and if so, how much do you trail by?

I recently started trading options, and after some initial success, I am now having problems.    Part of it is the usual greed, wanting to make X dollars profit, and so on.   I'm working on that.   But part of the problem is that I simply don't know what to use for a stop point (other than 0 profit) for options, or especially, how to use a trailing stop.

The option price varies so quickly, that you really need it to be some distance away from a stop point before you enter the limit order.   But every cent difference in the option price translates into quite a bit of profit!   If you use a 0.01 difference for the stop limit, you'll be stopping out all over the place.   If you use something bigger, like 0.06, you can still stop out during pullbacks (and 0.06 is a whole lot of profit to unnecessarily give up).

It's not that I don't how to use a trailing stop with stocks - I do.   But there I more or less know how much to trail the stock price by, allowing for some pullback.   With options, I just don't know what to do, that won't have me constantly stopping out on the one hand, or losing too much profit on the other.

Any help here?

And since I'm on the subject of options, has anyone here tried rolling over an option for one direction, to the other (for example, you thought the stock was going down but it changed direction, so you need to sell the put and buy a call).

To have intraday futures enables, you would need to have at least $15,000 int he account and we can then enable. On certain contrtacts you would get a reduced rate. ON /ES for example it is held at 50%. It is $6930 for 1 contract, so intraday margins would hold it at $346508:03 **Sean\_B**: /CL is held at 100%, so there is no reduced margin requirement when trading /CL08:03 **Sean\_B**: If you have any more questions, please reach out to us via chat or you can reach us by phone at 800-672-2098.

12:18 ME: This is substantially worse than at least 5 brokers that I can name off the top of my head. Also, I haven't had to provide documentation here previously for reduced commissions.

&#x200B;

Recently, I had misunderstood what classifies as a Day Trade with TD Ameritrade.  My interpretation was each round trip was one day trade, no matter how many times you buy/sell within each round trip.  I then found out that if I buy three times and then sell off the position in three more transactions, that this classifies as three day trades, even though it was technically only one round trip.  (e.g.  Buy 1k, Buy 1k, Buy 1k.. Sell 1k, Sell 1k, Sell 1k = 3 day trades).  

&#x200B;

Furthermore, the Day Trades Left balance showing in ThinkOrSwim was wrong for me.  I ended the trading session with it showing 1 day trade left, and then later got an email saying I was marked as a PDT.  The support person put a ticket in for this.  I think the Day Trades Left balance was counting just how I was.  

&#x200B;

So, I called TD Ameritrade to understand what happened and they told me that if I wanted to make it one day trade, I would've needed to sell off my entire position in one transaction.  So this led to them saying they just recently (within the last 2 weeks or so), instated a new policy where they can remove the PDT minimum equity call on an account up to three times per calendar year.  I was stoked to hear that news since previously I did make a mistake in my trades one day, and had made four day trades.  So, they were able to remove the PDT equity call on my account (for the second time) and the PDT equity call was removed within a few hours.

I constantly see posts about screen time being the only true way to learn and test strategies, yet very little compiled information about comparisons about different platforms that offer this service, and how to find and connect to market data (downloaded, 3rd party, hosted by platform company, etc.)

From what I've landed on NinjaTrader and TOS seems to be the most recommended for historical trading. That being said, are there any real strong reasons why one should use one or the other?

For setup on a platform such as Ninjatrader, for market replay data (not historical), does anyone have links to tutorials on methods of acquiring data? 

From what I can tell, Ninjatrader has some sort of partnership with Kinetick, that charges for market data (seems like mostly for live trading, and nickle and dime you for each data sub) anyone know if there is a good alternative to Kinetick?

t3_ca8fdl,Backtesting on ThinkorSwim Ondemand.,"I found an indicator that was made by engineers and is a customized RSI. Iâve been backtesting with it buying slightly OTM options that expire soon. Iâve only traded TSLA options and TSLA seems to move well to make nice profits and limited losses. 

Stategy Breakdown:

I put up 1.1k on each trade on average. This means if the call/put costs ~$350, Iâll buy 3 contracts. This is more or less an arbitrary amount that I feel comfortable with. Idk, lol. It just sits well with me. Every given trade I take risks only 1.1k in theory and since I set a stop loss, my largest loss is only 37% after slippage.

My typical stop loss is at -33% and I start scaling out once Iâm up around 30% or more. I sell 1/3 of my contracts, then if the price goes against me I immediately sell to break even at least. If the price continues making me tendies, I continue scaling out to take more profits. My average gains are 50% and losses capped at 33%. 

I day trade closest expiration calls/puts and use the 5 minute candles as well as another custom indicator I got off a facebook page (lol) that merges standard MACD settings into the candles to give them a red or blue appearance depending on if the price action is above or below the MACD lines. Close expiration means high theta rate of change but also high gamma ROC. This means if the stock moves a measley 30 cents, youâre potentially up a huge % on your position. I fookin love it. 

I also use up arrows or down arrows to indicate whether a high probability candle pattern presents itself. For example, If the RSI and MACD style candlesticks give me a buy signal, sometimes seeing a marubozu or harami in addition to those is a great convergence indicator that âall the stars are aligningâ for me to take this trade. I might buy 1 more contract than usual when this happens. 
I also have a âDaily True Rangeâ indicator up in the top left of the chart where the name of the company should be on ThinkorSwim. Once this DTR gets above 100%, I *usually* stop trading for the day and go run errands or go to the gym. Sometimes TSLA makes over 100% of itâs expected move as early as 10:30 am. In which case, what a short work day!

There are other rules I made up that I follow flexibly. For instance, I usually wait until after the first 25 mins of trading because unchecked chaos ensues right out of the gates. Usually the algos/day traders calm down a bit after 25 mins. Also, the data I recorded onto my excel sheet actually indicates that, had I taken a trade within the first 30 minutes every time I got a signal to buy calls/puts, I would have *lost* 67.3% of the time. F that shit. Let the psychos fizzle out their ADHD and autism.

Conclusion:

My win/loss ratio is roughly 73.6% with wins larger than losses. I literally married TSLA and the data says it was a good idea. Not gonna lie, it took time to discover this strategy and I basically found proprietary shit from a couple different people and slapped it together to see if it worked. I put in the time and effort, but make no mistake: I got *lucky*. 


I know some or probably all of you are like âum, please share your data, mkay? Tell us where you got that custom RSI and MACD infused candlesticks, please.â Iâm not finished testing or compiling the data. Iâm only at 3 months of data in 2014 and I plan on trading every single day up until about now. This will take some time. I will make another post when the time comes so either follow me, friend me, or whatever. As for the indicators, I subscribed to the users and do not want to violate any potential fair use laws. If you subscribe and follow Boilerroom Trading, as well as Theotrade, youâll eventually find what Iâm using. Of course, donât forget that I added my own rules and touches.

I should note that Iâm aware paper trading on TOS doesnât yield identical results to real trading. And to account for this, I have  subtracted 30% gains from my results to account for slippage and improbable illiquidity on TSLA options. My results above have this negative factor baked into them. 

Letâs be real here. Percentage gains are nice for testing and collecting data, but if youâre subbed to this sub and other subs like it, your long-term goal is *probably* to quit your day job and trade full-time. Using this strategy with real money, a conservative estimate for *me* is ~5hrs worked each of the ~21 trading days per month with an average of $5112.35 per month after accounting for slippage. This is in addition to gains from stock alert chatrooms I am subscribed to but thatâs another story. Total per month is roughly $12k

t3_ccihx8,Picking the right options contract for a short term (scalp) naked buy,"As we know, options, unlike futures, can vary widely on their value given the greeks. Futures have a Delta of 1 and move directly in line with the price movement of the stock. Options, on the other hand, usually have a Delta of .30 just out of the money, .5 at the money, and .7 just above in the money (give or take given the strike price intervals). Then you have to take into account the other deltas (importantly Gamma for this short term scenario).

&#x200B;

Given the following hypotheticals:

1. AAPL options contract at 1.30 just out of the money with a Delta of .30 and a Gamma of .06.
2. AAPL options contract at 2.75 at the money with a Delta of .50 and a Gamma of .08.
3. AAPL options contract at 4.30 just above in the money with a Delta of .70 and a Gamma of .06.

&#x200B;

My question is - taking into account commissions of roughly .75 per contract flat ($1.50 round trip) would it be more profitable to buy 10 OTM contracts, 5 ATM contracts, or 3 ITM contracts on a scalp (lets say at the open) with a relatively big move?

&#x200B;

I have been trading 10 contracts of 1. (OTM) with good success but commissions are a killer. If I could get the same or better results with 3. (ITM), it would greatly reduce my commissions. Also, another concerns would be filling limit orders with the faster price movements of a 3 than a 1 with the basically double delta.

&#x200B;

EDIT: My results on the market data available right now on TOS is as follows - It seems to say that buying more cheaper contracts is the way to go for a short term scalp. However, this is based on a big move of a hypothetical $1 dollar and investing roughly the same amount. It also is not taking into account Gamma which may make some difference. Also, given an unlimited supply of money, you have to take into account (A.) being able to get rid of a larger number of contracts and (B.) investing higher amounts if the move is a highly probable one to get the most out of the move even though (10contracts of a ITM with higher delta will give you back more but will be more expensive - if filling orders for more contracts is a concern). Most importantly, the below does not take into account losing trades - A 10 contract move is a guaranteed $15 commission if flat or lose vs a $4.50 commission at 3 contracts (at .75c flat each side). With a low win rate, this is particularly important. Overall, the below seems to indicate to buy as many contracts as affordable on a highly probable move. Please criticize at will to illuminate this conundrum.

**Top left:** 4 DOMs, left-most I change often. In the screenshot, it's showing Bitcoin futures, but I often look at Gold, Crude Oil, or currencies there. Second is most of the time the 10-year or 30-year treasury futures. Third one is the main, where I trade the E-mini S&P 500 futures. Fourth one is the E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures. This is where I place and manage nearly all of my orders related to day trading. The exception being when I'm day trading options, I might sometimes not use a DOM at all and just place the orders directly using an ""order entry"" window.

**Bottom left:** 5-min chart corresponding to the left-most DOM, the trading controls for the 4 DOMs above, the VIX and the TICK charts â these last 2 help me in my decision making process when trading the E-mini S&P 500 futures.

t3_cd5v65,Newcomers to futures trading might want to try this.,"A few months ago, I think sometime in March, a couple of new futures contracts came out that are a lot less risky than many large, popular futures contracts such as /ES and /NQ. 

The new contracts are micro lots of the major E-mini contracts such as the NQ and ES, called the /MNQ and /MES. 

The tick size is the same as their respective mini contracts, the NQ and ES being 0.25 per tick, however the dollar value per tick is 1/10th the size of their respective mini contracts. This means that on the /NQ each tick is worth $5.00 per contract, but the /MNQ is $0.50. Also the commissions per contract are much lower on /MNQ and /MES than the /NQ and /ES. 

When I started learning to trade futures I developed a good method that I was comfortable with and worked well on paper trading. I do not use any sort of automated system, I just take trades based on my own philosophy manually and using live market data. However when I started trading with real money on the /NQ and /ES I would get cold feet before many trades resulting in me chickening out or making bad decisions, due to the high risk. Those markets can take your account down hundreds of dollars in seconds on a single contract trade! 

The micro contracts solved this problem for me, as the risk is substantially lower, and I can execute trades without sweating and don't risk making mistakes due to fear. The volume seems plenty good for day trading and the price action is nearly a mirror image of the E-mini versions. Besides, if you're trading 10 micro contracts you're trading 1 mini contract and at that point you may as well just switch to the E-mini version. 

Just a suggestion for those new to futures trading who are trying to find a good market to trade. I suggest either /MNQ, /MES and their /ES, /NQ and just stick with learning to trade those. I know many people probably already know about these new micro contracts but I just wanted to put this out there for anyone just getting started or interested in trading futures as a less risky alternative to trading the major e-mini contracts, as most of the education about futures trading online is about these major e-mini markets!

t3_cgs4rh,Post and user flair suggestions for r/DayTrading,"Hey day traders, looking to get suggestions on flairs.  Currently our user flair is pretty basic, just beginner, intermediate, or advanced and we don't even verify this.  And we don't have any post flairs right now, so this post is going to address those 2 things.

I am considering mod only user flair assignment, and even hiring some flair mods from the community to give out flairs when appropriate.  Is that actually a good idea?  Either way, I'll let users keep choosing their own flair even after I add the new flairs while having mod only assignable flairs for the best of both worlds.

For posts:  Over at r/futurestrading I created a ton of post flairs with automod auto assigning them out, and users could still flair their own posts, plus a search by flair in the sidebar, and that worked out extremely well.

But here, I don't think we'll need such a broad spectrum of flairs based on futures, maybe just ""futures"" for all futures products, ""forex"" for all currency pairs, etc.  So these are what I'm planing for post flairs:

* stocks
* options
* futures
* forex
* crypto
* strategy
* algo
* question
* trade review
* trade idea
* ~~trading setup~~ workstations
* trading screens

As for user flairs I'm considering (since we can't discern or completely verify someone's skill level or gains, or have the time for that, none of the flairs will describe someone's skill level, except for them being a new member to the community and for the flairs rewarding someone's advice giving history):

*mod only assignable flairs*

* wiki contributor
* market wizard (given to users who have consistently given good advice)
* ~~sage of r/daytrading (same as market wizard, for now)~~

*user assignable flairs*

* new (will make default)
* stock trader
* penny stock trader
* options trader
* futures trader
* forex trader
* crypto trader
* algo trader
* algo stock trader
* algo options trader
* algo futures trader
* algo forex trader
* algo crypto trader
* trades everything
* trades multiple markets
* ~~investor~~ not-a-day-trader

What do you think?  Feel free to suggest other flairs that I didn't cover or tell me which flairs are just downright bad.

I could expand algo trader to ""algo stock trader"" and so on and that's it, but to get all the combinations for the rest would be an insane list.

t3_che1kc,Short selling looks easier,"If a stock shot high. not usual high, it will get slammed down and you know where to: to the floor. Especially if that is small cap stock. But if you see that stock goes up you don't know where it's going to. If you decide to jump on you may buy at the top and you will never know where is the top.  of course  there is a resistance lines and everything but if the shot is unusual (earnings report or manipulation) they all will not matter.

That's why I think that shorting is easier. You just see unusual ""going to the moon"", wait for it to go reverse and short, With low cap stocks you may just short the next day because they will go down quick and hard especially if it's manipulation. As an example  **LCI** which gone up 30% without any news. and now it's going to the floor (-17% next day). Am I missing something here? Please don't say that shorting has unlimited loss, but going long you can only lose what you invested. you can cut short and long where you want or it will be liquidated if 30% loss automatically.
Also overall you can't put very high price for the car because nobody will buy but you always can set price low and it will be bought. I wanna say that for the price it's far harder to go up than to go down.

t3_cn6ksl,Trading like a monkey - The power of watchlists,"I set a screen up with 4 charts and 4 order screens.  Each morning before the market open I look at what is moving.  I have trade-ideas with a list of stocks that reported earnings the before open and the night before.  I then look to see what has premarket volume, what might squeeze.  I had MTCH, PLNT, WW and TEVA as the stocks I was watching this morning.  I did not trade WW or TEVA that well, but because I worked on seeing what was going to move I could monkey my way into profits today!

Looking back, I should of taken more size of WW through 26 and layer my sells at 27, 28 and 29.  There is no resistance until the 30's.  I saw a 4 digit win and I took profits, which is probably not a bad way to go either.

t3_cpafkp,"We built a fee solution for you, and are looking for feedback.","Hey guys, 
I'm from a company called Morpher. Our goal has been to use blockchain to solve different financial issues, and most notably figure out how to make trading better. My own vendetta however has been to make daytrading more **feasible**. 

I traded for a long time across lots of markets; I've done outright equity  trading, options trading, Forex (A Booked and B Booked). 

Retail investors face a lot of obstacles in  trading; big spreads, high fees, and limitation with time. 

* So we made a trading platform where you can trade any asset (stocks, fx, commodities, indices, exotics, crypto) completely 24/7/365. We did this by creating an ER20 token with a smart contract that emulates the return profile of every asset. You can think of it as making a futures contract on a continuous basis, but for the *now* price. I'd also go so far as to say that it ""feels like a CFD"" but its not. So this means you can actually Buy or Sell the SP500 (shorting is instant with no interest expense) on the weekend no problem.

* We also charge no fees or commissions at all. We don't need to because there is no counter-party risk in this derivative. 

* We faced an issue when it came to spreads. We didn't know whether we wanted to emulate the spread or not. At the end of it we take the median price of the asset to emulate. So effectively, there aren't any spreads or slippage. 

* We also wanted to tackle the academic problem of ""perfect portfolio optimisation"". Because asset prices are all different you can technically only achieve perfect portfolio allocations when you trade with a high volume. So we fought this by implementing fractional trading. 


Only with Morpher can you short TSLA on a Saturday afternoon with $5.

Now we launched our virtual trading. Got some nice press from Forbes and Cointelegraph earlier this year. What we really want to do next is to work with traders so that we can improve our platform and add all the features that you want to see. 
We've built the bare bones, and now tell us what we can do to make this perfect! Heres the link to check out: [Morpher](https://www.morpher.com/reddit).",23,0.77,1565604980,"[['B', 1], ['TSLA', 1]]",B,44.45000076293945,46.310001373291016
t3_cp5fag,Robinhood execution performance,"I dipped my toe into day trading a couple years ago with very small accounts at TD and Etrade. Being completely new to it all, I wasn't able to last a year. Impulsive buys and even more impulsive sells were my biggest problem.  What also didn't help, however, were the brokerage fees. Good wins on small positions ended up not netting much and small losses became big ones relative to the size of my small account.

I've decided to take some fun money and give it another go. This time I'm looking for lower/no-cost brokers. I like Etrade's $4.95 price for frequent traders, but that's still a $10 round trip fee, and I don't know if I would be able to find time to get there while working my day job. Robinhood naturally comes to mind, but I've often read that they are slower to execute trades. Is there much truth to that?

t3_crlsl4,System Check: Predicting market open,"This system attempts to predict large price swings at market open. Price movement is too erratic to produce reliable results, so the VWAP is used as the primary indicator for entry.Â  I don't have a technical reason for using VWAP, other than noticing repeating patterns. The entry rules are complicated, but I have a [very specific setup](https://imgur.com/a/kXrZnWu) in mind. Hard stops are a must since price can move very quickly during this time.

Please let me know what you think. I specifically need help with exiting. Right now I'm considering just riding the trend until I see it break, but this makes it impossible to judge R-Multiple pre-trade, and I try to be diligent about that. Also, what stocks tend to have the 8pm close/4am open I see occasionally?

Scanner Criteria:

1. Premarket Movers
2. RSI(14)>70 or <30

Market Type:Â 

1. Nasdaq (stocks with longer after hours)
2. Overbought/oversold premarket

Indicators: order of relevance

1. VWAP
2. RSI

Entry:

1. VWAP made a large up or down move at night, and corrected for that move at night (more than 10%, but less than 90% correction).

* Do not trade if the VWAP consolidated at new price level.
* VWAP must move in the same direction as the overbought/sold condition.
* Do not trade if VWAP *over*corrects at night for large move
* Do not trade if the big move occurred right before market open, with not time to correct/consolidate.Â 

1. RSI showed an ODD number of oversold or overbought conditions (2 oversold signals is a long trade, where as an overbought and an oversold signal is no trade).

* Do not trade if overbought/sold signals do not match VWAP move (i.e. VWAP moves down but RSI shows overbought signal)

1. At 9:00a, trade opposite of whichever direction experienced the most overbought/sold signals.

Confirmation:

1. Position is correct according to 200EMA (long if below, short if above).
2. RSI is already trending in direction of trade just before open.

Exit signals:

1. RSI passes through overbought/sold level, signaling end of move
2. Standard support levels (HOD/LOD, 200 EMA), but these types of moves carry more momentum, so make sure it is not breaking support before exiting.

Hard Exit:

* Giving back more than 25% profit (this is a general rule to lock in profits and not waste time)
* Instead of moving in intended direction, stock trades rapidly in a channel for >10 min. GTFO

Position Sizing Strategy: $100000 equity

* Risk 1% of equity, $1000
* R Multiple greater than or equal to 2:1
* Stop orders: bottom or top of premarket VWAP move. If excessively large, just use a realistic level.

Observations:

* Might be able to cater system to VWAP consolidations
* Might be a good idea to wait til 9:01 to trade. First candle is sometimes opposite of trend.

t3_cv544w,"Sharing my trades this week. +1,262.73 trading Micro S&P Futures DOUBLING My tiny account","Hey everybody, I'm doing a sort of ""small account challenge."" I want to see how big I can grow my account using Micros then transitioning into Eminis. I started the week with $1,340.77 and ended at $2,603.50. Here's the statement from AMP Futures:  https://imgur.com/uPcBFnN  

So, I take longer-term trades, usually entering a position between 9PM and 11PM EST and staying in sometimes 24 hours or more. 

My best trade was going short on Thursday and holding on, not getting shaken out of the trade. And I'll show you why I stayed short. **It's important to note that I trade ""deaf"" -- I do not listen to news.** So, I didn't know what was going on with Jerome Powell at the J-Hole thing, I had no idea Trump tweeted something after it was over. My decisions were based 100% on price action and volume. 

**Why I went short:**

Here on this chart I've circled three areas:  https://imgur.com/bm4pbTe  (NOTE: As you can see I'm still short 1 micro contract that I'm holding into Monday). 

So the two red circles to the left, you can see the price went up to that area, chopped sideways, then rejected, heading back down. 

Another thing you can see is that the 200 moving average (thick purple line) started flattening out and curving down (I drew a couple of arrows under the 200 MA so you can see what I'm talking about). 

So when Tuesday / Wednesday came around this week I saw the same thing. Price was chopping around and then I saw that ""curve"" start to happen on the 200 MA. 

On Thursday I decided I was going to place a trade and just stay in it (previous to that, I was going short, then exiting as price came back up again, so not really staying in for the ""long haul"" reversal I believed was coming). 

So I basically got in with 2 contracts, set my stop about 15 points up (above all that previous resistance I circled) and decided even if I took the loss, I'd still be up on the week, so whatever. 

On Friday I was even MORE convinced that this was going to retrace hard, so I added on 5 more micro contracts, with the idea to take most of them off intraday and let one or two ride through the weekend. 

I recorded that trading session here: [https://youtu.be/peoBmVk2GLU](https://youtu.be/peoBmVk2GLU) 

As you can see, it retraced HARD and I plan on staying in with this last contract until the 13 MA crosses the 30 MA then I'll exit.

t3_d0urdd,How you deal with lost opportunities/trades?,"Hello everyone!

I'm trading BTC and ETH on Binance and was waiting for a major move for a week.  
My short order for Bitcoin was set to $10,900  and the move was from $10,870 ($10,905 flash); for Ethereum my short was $177 and the high was $176.7.  
My long was set to $10,400 for Bitcoin and the low was $10,350 and for ETH it was $170 which has been actual low also.  
The move alone was sufficient enough to pay my luxury rent and I feel just horrible because of it now.  
I guess it's better than a lost trade but it feels equally bad, maybe because it was so close. I wonder how you deal with such lost opportunities/trades and what you do to prevent it.

t3_d72eot,"How much 1 minute and daily volume to trade without too much slippage with $100,000","Hi guys.  I was looking through this sub, thinking of PM-ing a moderator or top contributor, but I looked through the mods' recent posts and didn't find one that obviously ""clicked"".  So I looked through some recent posts and this seems like a good post to reply to for visibility.

I would like to spend time doing research into machine learning, and then use it on the Forex market when the midel makes high-confidence predictions.  I have tons of spare time but no ""bankroll"", and since I understand that nothing I would do would affect the market, it seems kind of strange to try to grow a small account organically.  What I mean is that if I made a 2% gain literally two hundred times in a row that would be a net 1.02^200 = 52x, if there are no trading fees.  Starting with $500 would only just get me to 26k, and if there were transaction fees even less.  But starting with $5k (which I don't have atm) would net 260k.  Even if I split it 80:20 to the backer that would still be better for me.

I do realize this is like pump and dump of penny stock schemes, which is why I think focusing on Forex would remove this component.  I mean that I don't think it would require anyone to trust me, and on my end I wouldn't be sharing my model so if someone didn't pay up I could just move on to the next person - it would still be better than trying to grow from a small organic base.

So I think it is not really possible for me to pull one over on someone.

The specifics of the research I'd like to do is sentiment analysis of breaking news, and its effect on forex, since I think that analyzing sentiment from text is something I can leverage into my career: stuff like analyzing reviews, etc.

There is a lot of labelled/classified data on sites that let people leave reviews and also a star rating (i.e. the number of stars is the labelling/classification).  Likewise the past results of forex markets based on news items would be my classification of those news items.

If anyone has any advice for me, I would be interested in hearing it here.

My background: I can program in multiple languages, and have less than a year of ML experience.  I am currently learning about more advanced techniques. For the moment I would use my own setup which has 16 GB of RAM and a 1060 GPU with 6 GB.  If I get my hands on a lot of data I would like to upgrade to 64 GB RAM and maybe a beefier RTX system.  For my purposes I don't think I need to spend a lot more on the cloud.  I think that the quality of the data that I start with and the model parameters are more important.  In the end, the idea that an analyst can derive market sentiment from news is a pretty straightforward hypothesis.

Some of the main questions I have:

- Is what I have in mind reasonable?

- is there anything big that you think I'm missing?

- is there something about my approach that would make it seem like a scam? What can I do to remove this component or make the transaction more foolproof (remove counterparty risk)

- do I need to worry about a reverse scam: is anyone going to try to scam me? How can I eliminate this risk?

The main thing I could think of would be if they for example traded 500k but told me they were only doing 5k, so rather than 80:20 on profits, it's 99:1 to them which I consider unfair given my contribution. I think by verifying real world identity I could see what level someone was at.

t3_d8odtd,RULES I WANT TO ADOPT BASED ON MY FAILURES â I AM A LOSER I WILL WIN IT ALL ONE DAY â I WONâT QUIT !,"I have lost a lot and following are my reasons of losses. Hope it helps people. At one point on a given day I am positive with enough to walk away... I end up losing because of the following reasons: 

1. I wonât trade at market open. 
2. I wonât trade in choppy or pinned market.
3. If I miss the entry I wonât regret.
4. Fear of Missing out (FOMO).
5. I will only follow one strategy doesnât matter what I trade. For me âDivergenceâ is best strategy. It has best possibilities. Specially when 3-4 HH or 3-4 LL are created. 
6. I will manage risk properly to attain series of similar trades so I can have better win loss ratios. 
7. I wonât have TIGHT STOP LOSS: I will prefer 5-10 on NQ and 2-3  on ES. (points) if needed will decrease contract size. Time Frames: 5-15 for day trading. 
8. Risk size will be 0.5 - 1% only. This must not change whether I AM FEARFUL OR I LOST IN PREVIOUS TRADES. 
9. I WONT OVER TRADE. I find myself addicted to looking at chart and I feel uneasy if I am not trading. Itâs not good thing. I am stressed and probably in sort of depression. Trading has taken over my life and only way for me to come out is if I can achieve mental balance. 
10. I will Only TRADE if there is DIVERGENCE on chart. Divergence indicates a good direction change. 
11. I will walk away and wonât trade once I see some money on the table to give me good monthly income. 
12. I wonât be GREEDY. 
13. I will not close a SELL OF TRADE EARLY out of nervousness. These trades push down and down until exhausted and are quick trades.
I have been in trades that could give me $5000-30000 in single trade but I get our with 1000-2000 and then watch myself fall it further and end up chasing and lose what I made. 
14. I will never sell a slow upward movement. They tend to not stop without failing 3-4 times. In times like these I will not look at 3-4 HH but rather go on higher time frame to see how overbought it gets. Then take trade. 
15. I will incorporate âRENKOâ chart to give myself a clean structure at times.
16. LASTLY I WILL FOCUS ON WINNING TRADES  SO WILL ONLY TAKE HIGHEST PROBABILITY TRADES. I want to keep my win ratio over 70%. 

I hope this post helps people like me. I trade futures. And I have a lot of knowledge but just not enough balls to practice what I preach. I hope I find cure to my trading. Help yourself and others as well. I have given big sacrifices to follow my trading interest. Itâs not easy and I am not kidding. All the best !

t3_dalv7r,My First Year of Trading,"So here it is, three more days and October begins, which marks one year of trading for me. I figured I would contribute to the forum and share some of my experience, a little about me, and what I've learned so far. Whoever wants to listen, that's great. This might get long so buckle up..

Three years ago, I was visiting Toronto. I don't get out much, but my roommate at the time travels there occasionally. He asked everyone at our place if we wanted to come along for a weekend. My roommate has an uncle that lives there and we didn't have to worry about a hotel because his uncle owns a small house that's unlived in which we could stay at. I was the only one to go with. Anyways, we walk around the city, seeing the sights and whatnot. 

My friend says to me ""where next?"" 

""I don't know, you're the tour guide""

""We can go check out Bay Street""

""what's 'Bay Street?'""

""It's like the Canadian Wall street! If you haven't seen it you gotta see it!""

Walking along Bay, I admire all the nice buildings and architecture, everything seems larger than life to me. I love things like that. The huge granite facades with intricate designs and towering pillars to make you think, *How the fuck did they make that?* My attention pivots to a man walking on the sidewalk opposite us. His gait stood out among everyone, he walked with such a purpose.. He laughed into the cell phone to his ear. In the elbow-shoving city environment, he moved with a stride that exuded a power which not only commanded respect, but assumed it. *I bet HE can get a text back, hell he's probably got girls waiting on him.* This dude was dressed to kill, a navy suit that you could just tell from across the street was way out of my budget, it was a nice fucking suit. *I want that.* His life, across the street, seemed a world a way from my own. I've worn a suit maybe *twice* in my life. For my first communion, it was too big for me, I was eleven or whatever so who gives a shit, right? I'm positive I looked ridiculous. *The other time?* I can't remember.

 *I want that. I want the suit.* I want the *wealth*, the *independence.* *I want the respect and power, and I don't give a shit what anyone thinks about it.*

Cue self doubt.

*Well, He's probably some rich banker's son. That's a world you're born into. I don't know shit about it. \*sigh\* keep walking..*

&#x200B;

A year later, I'm visiting my parents at their house, they live an hour away from my place. My dad is back from Tennessee, his engineering job was laying people off and he got canned... Or he  saw the end was near and just left... I don't know, hard to pay attention to the guy honestly because he kind of just drones on and on. (*""Wait, so your mom lives in Michigan, but your dad moved to Tennessee... for a job?""* Yea man, I don't fucking know, not going to touch on that one.*)* The whole project was a shit show that was doomed to never get done, the way he tells it. And he's obviously jaded from multiple similar experiences at other life-sucking engineer jobs. My mom is a retired nurse practitioner who no longer works because of her illness. I ask him what he's doing for work now and he tells me he trades stocks from home. I didn't even know you could do that. I didn't know ""trading"" was a thing. I thought you just invest and hope for the best.

""Oh that's cool, how much money do you need to do that?""

""Ehh, most say you need at least $25,000 as a minimum""

""Oh... guess I can't do that...""

   

Six months later, I get a call and it's my dad. We talk a little about whatever. Off topic, he starts asking if I'm happy doing what I'm doing (I was a painter, commercial and residential) I tell him yes but it's kind of a pain in the ass and I don't see it as a long term thing. Then he gets around to asking if I'd like to come work with him. He basically pitches it to me. I'm not one to be sold on something, I'm always skeptical. So I ask all the questions that any rational person would ask and he just swats them away with reassuring phrases. He was real confident about it. But basically he says for this to work, I have to quit my job and move back home so he can teach me how to trade and be by my side so I don't do anything stupid. *""**~~My Name~~* *, you can make so much money.""* I say that I can't raise the $25,000 because I'm not far above just living paycheck to paycheck. ""I can help you out with that."" Wow, okay, well... let me think about it.

My ""maybe"" very soon turned into a ""definitely."" So over the next six months, I continue to work my day job painting, and I try to save up what I could for the transition (it wasn't a whole lot, I sucked at saving. I was great at spending though!). My dad gives me a book on day trading (which I will mention later) and I teach myself what I can about the stock market using Investopedia. Also in the meantime, my dad sends me encouraging emails. He tells me to think of an annual income I would like to make as a trader, and used ""more than $100,000 but less than a million"" as a guideline. He tells me about stocks that he traded that day or just ones that moved and describes the basic price action and the prices to buy and sell at. Basically saying ""if you bought X amount of shares here and sold it at X price here, you could make a quick 500 bucks!"" I then use a trading sim to trade those symbols and try to emulate what he says. Piece of cake. ;) 

*Wow, that's way more than what I make in a day.*

He tells me not to tell anyone about my trading because most people just think it's gambling. ""*Don't tell your Mom either.""* He says most people who try this fail because they don't know how to stop out and take a loss. He talks about how every day he was in a popular chatroom, some noob would say something like, ""Hey guys, I bought at X price (high of day or thereabout), my account is down 80% .. uhh I'm waiting for it to come back to my entry price.. what do I do??"" 

*Well shit, I'm not that fucking dumb. If that's all it takes to make it is to buy low, sell high, and always respect a stop then I'll be fantastic.* 

By the end of September, I was very determined. I had been looking forward everyday to quitting my painting job because while it used to be something I loved, it was just sucking the life out of me at this point. Especially working commercial, you just get worked like a dog. I wasn't living up to my potential with that job and I felt awful for it every minute of every day. I knew that I needed a job where I could use my brain instead of slaving my body to fulfill someone else's dream. *""Someone's gotta put gas in the boss's boat""* That's a line my buddy once said that he probably doesn't know sticks with me to this day. 

*It ain't me.*

So now it was October 2018, and I'm back living with Mom n' Pops. I was so determined that on my last day of work I gave away all of my painting tools to my buddy like, ""here, I don't need this shit."" Moving out of my rental was easy because I don't own much, 'can't take it with ya.' Excited for the future I now spend my days bundled up in winter wear in the cold air of our hoarder-like basement with a space heater at my feet. My laptop connected to a TV monitor, I'm looking at stocks next to my dad and his screens in his cluttered corner. Our *Trading Dungeon.* I don't trade any money, (I wasn't aware of any real-time sim programs) I just watch and learn from my dad. Now you've got to keep in mind, and look at a chart of the S&P, this is right at the beginning of Oct '18, I came in right at the market top. Right at the start of the shit-show. For the next three or four weeks, I watch my dad pretty much scratch on every trade, taking small loss after small loss, and cursing under his breath at the screen. 

Click.

""*dammit.""* 

*Click.*  

*""shit.""* 

*Click. Click.*

*""you fuck.""*

Click.

This gets really fucking annoying as time goes on, for weeks, and I get this attitude like *ugh, just let me do it. I'll make us some fucking money.* So I convince him to let me start trading live. I didn't know anything about brokers so I set up an account using his broker, which was Fidelity. It was a pain and I had to jump through a lot of hoops to be able to day trade with this broker. I actually had to make a joint account with my dad as I couldn't get approved for margin because my credit score is shit (never owned a credit card) and my net worth, not much. Anyways, they straight up discourage day trading and I get all kinds of warning messages with big red letters that made me shit myself like ***oooaaahhh what the fuck did I do now. Did I forget to close a position?? Did I fat finger an order? Am I now in debt for thousands of dollars to Fidelity?? They're going to come after me like they came after Madoff.*** Even after you are approved for PDT you still get these warning messages in your account. Some would say if  I didn't comply with ""whatever rule"" they'd even suspend my account for 60 days.  It was ridiculous, hard to describe because it doesn't make sense, and it took the support guy on the phone a good 20 minutes to explain it to me. Basically I got the answer ""yea it's all good, you did nothing wrong. As long as you have the cash in your account to cover whatever the trade balance was"" So I just kept getting these warnings that I had to ignore everyday. I hate Fidelity.

My fist day trading, I made a few so-so trades and then I got impatient. I saw YECO breaking out and I chased, soon realized I chased, so I got out. -$500. *Shit, I have to make that back, I don't want my dad to see this.* Got back in. *Shit.* \-$400. So my first day trading, I lost $900. My dumbass was using market orders so that sure didn't help. I reeled the risk back and traded more proper position size for a while, but the commissions for a round trip are $10, so taking six trades per day, I'm losing $60 at a minimum on top of my losing trades. Quickly I realized I didn't know what the hell I was doing.  *What about my dad? Does HE know?* One day, in the trading dungeon, I was frustrated with the experience I'd been having and just feeling lost overall. I asked him.

""no.""

...................

*Holy fucking shit, what did this idiot get me into. He can't even say it to my face and admit it.*

This entire life decision, quitting my job, leaving my rental, moving from my city to back home, giving shit away, it all relied on that. I was supposed to be an apprentice to a ***consistently profitable day trader who trades for a living.*** It was so assumed, that I never even thought to ask! Why would you tell your son to quit his job for something that you yourself cannot do? *Is this all a scam? Did my dad get sold a DREAM? Did I buy into some kind of ponzi scheme? How many of those winning trades he showed me did he actually take?* ***Are there ANY consistently profitable DAY TRADERS who TRADE FOR A LIVING?***  *Why do 90% fail? Is it because the other 10% are scamming the rest in some way?* Completely lost, I just had no clue what was what. If I was going to succeed at this, if it was even *possible* to succeed at this, it was entirely up to me. I had to figure it out. I still remember the feeling like an overwhelming, crushing weight on me as it all sunk in. *This is going to be a big deal..* I'm not the type to give up though. In that moment, I said to myself,

***I'm going to fucking win at this. I don't know if this is possible, but I'm going to find out. I cannot say with certainty that I will succeed, but no matter what, I will not give up. I'm going to give all of myself to this. I will find the truth.***

It was a deep moment for me. I don't like getting on my soapbox, but when I said those things, I meant it. *I really, really meant it. I still do, and I still will.*

Now it might seem like I'm being hard on my dad. He has done a lot for me and I am very grateful for that. We're sarcastic as hell to each other, I love the bastard. Hell, I wouldn't have the opportunity to trade at all if not for him. But maybe you can also understand how overwhelmed I felt at that time. Not on purpose, of course he means well. But I am not a trusting person at all and I was willing to put trust into him after all the convincing and was very disappointed when I witnessed the reality of the situation. I would have structured this transition to trading differently, **you don't just quit your job and start trading.** Nobody was there to tell me that! I was told quite the opposite. I'm glad it happened anyway, so fuck it. I heard Kevin O'Leary once say,

 *""If I knew in the beginning how difficult starting a business was, I don't know that I ever would've started.""* 

This applies very much to my experience.



So what did I do? Well like everyone I read and read and Googled and Youtube'd my ass off. I sure as hell didn't pay for a course because I didn't have the money and I'm like 99% sure I would be disappointed by whatever they were teaching as pretty much everything can be found online or in books for cheap or free. Also I discovered Thinkorswim and I used that to sim trade in real-time for three months. This is way the hell different than going on a sim at 5x speed and just clicking a few buy and sell buttons. Lol, useless. When you sim trade in real-time you're forced to have a routine, and you're forced to experience missing trades with no chance to rewind or skip the boring parts. That's a step up because you're ""in it"". I also traded real money too, made some, lost more than I made. went back to sim. Traded live again, made some but lost more, fell back to PDT. Dad fronted me more cash. This has happened a few times. He's dug me out of some holes because he believes in me. I'm fortunate. 

Oh yeah, about that book my dad gave me. It's called A Beginner's Guide to Day Trading Online by Toni Turner. This book... is shit. This was supposed to be my framework for how to trade and I swear it's like literally nothing in this book fucking works lol. I could tell this pretty early on, intuitively, just by looking at charts.  It's basically a buy-the-breakout type strategy, if you want to call it a strategy. No real methodology to anything just vague crap and showing you cherry-picked charts with entries that are way too late. With experience in the markets you will eventually come to find that MOST BREAKOUTS FAIL. It talks about support/resistance lines and describes them as, ""picture throwing a ball down at the floor, it bounces up and then it bounces down off the ceiling, then back up."" So many asinine assumptions. These ideas are a text book way of how to trade like dumb money. Don't get me wrong, these trades can work but you need to be able to identify the setups which are more probable and identify reasons not to take others. So I basically had to un-learn all that shit. 

Present day, I have a routine in place. I'm out of the dungeon and trade by myself in my room. I trade with a discount broker that is catered to day traders and doesn't rape me on commissions. My mornings have a framework for analyzing the news and economic events of the particular day, I journal so that I can recognize what I'm doing right and where I need to improve. I record my screens for later review to improve my tape reading skills. I am actually tracking my trades now and doing backtesting in equities as well as forex. I'm not a fast reader but I do read a lot, as much as I can. So far I have read about 17-18 books on trading and psychology. I've definitely got a lot more skilled at trading. 

As of yet I am not net profitable. Writing that sounds like selling myself short though, honestly. Because a lot of my trades are very good and are executed well. I have talent. However, lesser quality trades and trades which are inappropriately sized/ attempted too many times bring down that P/L. I'm not the type of trader to ignore a stop, I'm more the trader that just widdles their account down with small losses. I trade live because at this point, sim has lost its value, live trading is the ultimate teacher. So I do trade live but I just don't go big like I did before, I keep it small. 

I could show you trades that I did great on and make people think I'm killing it but I really just don't need the validation. I don't care, I'm real about it. I just want to get better.  I don't need people to think I'm a genius, I'm just trying to make some money.

Psychologically, to be honest with you, I currently feel beaten down and exhausted. I put a lot of energy into this, and sometimes I work myself physically sick, it's happened multiple times. About once a week, usually Saturday, I get a headache that lasts all day. My body's stress rebound mechanism you might call it. Getting over one of those sick periods now, which is why I barely even traded this week. I know I missed a lot of volatility this week and some A+ setups but I really just don't give a shit lol. I just currently don't have the mental capital, I think anyone who's been day trading every day for a year or more can understand what I mean by that. I'm still being productive though. Again, I'm not here to present an image of some badass trader, just keeping it real. To give something 100% day after day while receiving so much resistance, it takes a toll on you. So a break is necessary to avoid making bad trading decisions.  That being said, I'm progressing more and more and eliminating those lesser quality trades and identifying my bad habits. I take steps to control those habits and strengthen my good habits such as having a solid routine, doing review and market research, taking profits at the right times, etc.

   

  So maybe I can give some advice to some that are new to day trading, those who are feeling lost, or just in general thinking *""...What the fuck...""* I thought that every night for the first 6 months lol. 

First of all, **manage expectations.** If you read my story of how I came to be a trader, you can see I had a false impression of trading in many aspects. Give yourself a realistic time horizon to how progress should be made. Do not set a monetary goal for yourself, or any time-based goal that is measured in your P/L. If you tell yourself, ""*I want to make X per day, X per week, or X per year""* you're setting yourself up to feel like shit every single day when it's clear as the blue sky that you won't reach that goal anytime soon. As a matter of fact, it will appear you are moving further AWAY from that goal if you just focus on your P/L, which brings me to my next point.

**You will lose money.** In the beginning, most likely, you will lose money. I did it, you'll do it, the greatest Paul Tudor Jones did it. Trading is a skill that needs to be developed, and it is a process. Just look at it as paying your tuition to the market. Sim is fine but don't assume you have acquired this skill until you are adept at trading real money. So when you do make that leap, just trade small. 

**Just survive.** Trade small. get the experience. Protect your capital. To reach break even on your bottom line is a huge accomplishment. *In many ways, experience and screen time are the secret sauce.*

**Have a routine.** This is very important. I actually will probably make a more in-depth post in the future about this if people want it. When I first started, I was overwhelmed with the feeling *""What the fuck am I supposed to DO?""* I felt lost. There's no boss to tell you how to be productive or how to find the right stocks, which is mostly a blessing, but a curse for new traders.

**All that shit you see, don't believe all that bullshit.** You know what I'm talking about. The bragposting, the clickbait Youtube videos, the ads preying on you. ""I made X amount of money in a day and I'm fucking 19 lolz look at my Lamborghini"" It's all a gimmick to sell you the dream. It's designed to poke right at your insecurities, that's marketing at it's finest. As for the bragposting on forums honestly, who cares. And I'm not pointing fingers on this forum, just any trading forum in general. They are never adding anything of value to the community in their posts. They never say *this is how I did it.* No, they just want you to think they're a genius. I can show you my $900 day trading the shit out of TSLA, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Gamblers never show you when they lose, you might never hear from those guys again because behind the scenes, they over-leveraged themselves and blew up. *Some may actually be consistently profitable and the trades are 100% legit.* That's fantastic. But again, I don't care, and you shouldn't either. You shouldn't compare yourself to others. 

**""Everyone's a genius in a bull market""** Here's the thing.. Markets change. Edges disappear. Trading strategies were made by traders who traded during times when everything they did worked. *Buy all the breakouts? Sure! It's the fucking tech bubble! Everything works!* I'm sure all those typical setups used to work fantastically at some point in time. But the more people realize them, the less effective they are. *SOMEONE has to be losing money on the opposite side of a winning trade*, and who's willing to do that when the trade is so obvious? That being said, some things are obvious AND still work. Technical analysis works... sometimes. The caveat to that is, filters. You need to, in some way, filter out certain setups from others. For example, you could say, ""I won't take a wedge pattern setup on an intraday chart unless it is in a higher time frame uptrend, without nearby resistance, and trading above average volume with news on that day.""

**Have a plan.** If you can't describe your plan, you don't have one. Think in probabilities. You should think entirely in ""if, then"" scenarios. *If X has happens, then Y will probably happen. ""If BABA breaks this premarket support level on the open I will look for a pop up to short into.""*

**Backtest.** Most traders lose mainly because they think they have an edge but they don't. You read these books and all this stuff online telling you ""this is a high probability setup"" but do you know that for a fact? There's different ways to backtest, but I think the best way for a beginner is manual backtesting with a chart and an excel sheet. This builds up that screen time and pattern recognition faster. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSIRv_eajzI&t=1230s) shows how to do that. Once I *saw* someone do it, it didn't seem so boring and awful as I thought it was. 

**Intelligence is not enough.** You're smarter than most people, that's great, but that alone is not enough to make you money in trading necessarily. Brilliant people try and fail at this all the time, lawyers, doctors, surgeons, engineers.. Why do they fail if they're so smart? *~~It's all a fucking scam.~~* No, a number of reasons, but the biggest is *discipline* and *emotional intelligence.* 

**Journal every day.** *~~K no thanks, bro. That's fucking gay.~~*  That's how I felt when I heard this advice but really that is pride and laziness talking. This is the process you need to do to learn what works for you and what doesn't. Review the trades you took, what your plan was, what actually happened, how you executed. Identify what you did well and what you can work on. This is how you develop *discipline* and *emotional intelligence,* by monitoring yourself. How you feel physically and mentally, and how these states affect your decision-making.

**Always be learning.** Read as much as you can. Good quality books. Here's the best I've read so far;

One Good Trade -Mike Bellafiore

**Be nimble.** Everyday I do my research on the symbols I'm trading and the fundamental news that's driving them. I might be trading a large cap that's gapping up with a beat on EPS and revenue and positive guidance. But if I see that stock pop up and fail miserably on the open amidst huge selling pressure, and I look and see the broader market tanking, guess what, I'm getting short, and that's just day trading. *The movement of the market, on an intraday timeframe, doesn't have to make logical sense.*

**Adapt.** In March I used to be able to buy a breakout on a symbol and swing it for the majority of the day. In the summer I was basically scalping on the open and being done for the day. Volatility changes, and so do my profit targets.

**Be accountable. Be humble. Be honest.** I take 100% responsibility for every dime I've lost or made in the market. It's not the market makers fault, it wasn't the HFTs, *I pressed the button.* I know my bad habits and I know my good habits.. my strengths/ my weaknesses.

**Protect yourself from toxicity.** Stay away from traders and people on forums who just have that negative mindset. That ""can't be done"" mentality.  *~~Day trading is a scam!!~~* It can certainly be done. ~~Prove it, you bastard.~~ I'm posting to this particular forum because I don't see much of that here and apparently the mods to a good job of not tolerating it. As the mod wrote in the rules, they're most likely raging from a loss. Also, the Stocktwits mentality of ""AAPL is going to TANK on the open! $180, here we come. $$$"" , or the grandiose stories, ""I just *knew* AMZN was going to go up on earnings. *I could feel it.* I went ALL IN. Options money, baby! ka-ching!$"" Lol, that is so toxic to a new trader. Get away from that. *How will you be able to remain nimble when this is your thought process?*

**Be good to yourself.** Stop beating yourself up. You're an entrepreneur. You're *boldly going where no man has gone before.* You've got balls. 

Acknowledge your mistakes, don't identify with them. Y*ou are not your mistakes and you are not your bad habits*. These are only *things that you do*, and you can take action necessary to *do them less.*

It doesn't matter what people think. Maybe they think you're a fool, a gambler. You don't need their approval. You don't need to talk to your co-workers and friends about it to satisfy some subconscious plea for guidance; *is this a good idea?*

*You don't need anyone's permission to become the person you want to be.*

t3_dcvi1p,Verdict on TD Ameritrade Free Commissions??,"I use TOS for my analysis and charting, IB for my scalping strategy, and Robinhood for fun when I'm bored on my phone. When Ameritrade announced zero commissions this week, I decided to transfer my Robinhood funds to Ameritrade (side note, transferring the funds was scary easy... Ameritrade basically asked me what my Robinhood account number is, and that was it... Robinhood shot me an email the next day saying my account was closing).  When the funds clear to Ameritrade so I'm not getting hit with pattern day trading, I'll play my scalping strategy on TOS for a few days to see how things work out. I'm usually trading on $.10 - $.20 deviation per share, so it's important to me that my order is routed efficiently as not to lose a few pennies on a trade because I'm being bounced around to a bunch of high frequency traders. Obviously, with Robinhood, my orders NEVER filled at the current price; scalping was impossible (plus, you know, their nasty interface). I'm wondering if Ameritrade will be better and, if so, will it be as good as IB for scalping. I'll report back once I get a few trades under my belt on TOS, but I'm wondering if anyone has any experience scalping on TOS.

t3_ddemnw,Should i stick to the Stock market or switch to FX? ( 600 euro account),"Hello guys i have been ""long term investing"" for like 1.5 year now started with 380 dollars. I had shares in AMD but i sold them out at around 34 dollars. 

The reason i did that was because i kept seeing every day the price going up and down at a veeery predictable manner. I started searching what was causing this and i stumpled upon day / swing trading.

It sounded sketchy at first and backed by statistics like "" 95% of day traders lose money"" ( great way to lie with statistics btw) so i have been hesitant to start engaging in it. 

Eventually i started digging really hard in it for the past month or so and i even have been successful in most of my trades. ( small gains around 5-10 bucks or break even)

So my goal now is to grow my account to 5000 dollars and after that having a goal of ~20% per month (The reason for this is because it is double the minimal wage in my country  , Greece).
I searched a bit in here for guys in simillar situations and most of the times i see you guys suggesting the FX market as an easier way to grow a small account

So how does the stock market compares  vs the FX market?. 
Big factor for my situation : I use Etoro it has 0 commission fees  and for technical analysis i use webull(Although i would love to have lvl 2). 
Cons on stock market for Etoro : limited amount of sto ks it mainly has large cap stocks since they are more popular.

A couple more things for me :
1) I am shiting bricks when i open positions with bad fundamentals even though techinal analysis supports my decision (looking at you Nio)
2) I like both intraday and swing trades.
3)I never used leverage even though i know what it is and i am kinda hesitant using it
4)I really love that the Forex market is open 24/5.

Overall i feel this is a great opportunity for someone in Greece because :
You are taxed at 15% (7% less than having a job)
Minimal wage is 550 euro per month (Although you will be lucky to find a 8 hour job)
Cost of living is around 550 euro per month for housing and food( no car)
You can be a consistent trader for a living and be categorised as unemployed and getting free welfare checks :p (spoked with my fathers accountant about this)

That's all folks i would really appriciate your opinions :)

t3_dfn9z5,"""One Timeframing"": what is it, how to spot and benefit from","tl;dr - example of the ES market **one timeframing** today, indicating which direction to consider a trade and which direction to avoid, during that period.

&#x200B;

**Intro**

In the study of Market Profile and Auction Theory, there's a concept called ""**One Timeframing**"". Simplifying, it essentially means that someone with *much* more capital, and trading in a *much* bigger timeframe than most retail day traders, is now present in the market, and will likely move the market quite a bit for quite a while. This ""someone"" might be an individual trader with incredibly deep pockets, a trader working with institutional money, or maybe even a huge fund that needs to manage an extremely large position.

A ""someone"" with the characteristics just described is usually referred to as a **higher timeframe participant** (HTP), sometimes also ""other timeframe participant (OTP)"". I prefer and will use HTP.

An HTP is usually not as sensitive to price as retail day traders: change of a few points in price won't likely be that big of a difference towards their goals. They are usually in for the much longer term, trying to capture very long, fundamental moves.

The retail day trader, on the other hand, is often using a considerable amount of leverage, is usually looking for a profit within the day, and is usually risking a non-negligible percentage of their account; that makes the retail day trader quite sensitive to price. If a trade moves a bit against the day trader, they're usually gonna have to close it for a loss, to not risk blowing the account.

This is to say that it's usually foolish for a retail day trader to go against an HTP. Instead, ***going along with*** **the HTP is much more likely to generate profits** for the day trader.

&#x200B;

**Identifying a higher timeframe participant**

In general, HTPs are more concerned with being able to fill their very large orders when they need them, rather than waiting for the absolute best price. The amount of liquidity they need isn't usually readily available â they know to accept that fact and that they will end up pushing the market a bit.

To not completely spook the market and be able to get a decent average price for their order, *the HTP will likely try to hide their presence*:

* you'll likely not see huge market orders hitting the market; and
* you'll likely not see huge limit orders resting on the order book.

Instead, the HTP will often use *iceberg* orders, sometimes also called *refreshing* orders.

>!These are limit orders that are either held at the exchange and only display part of their total size in the order book, and the exchange automatically displays another part of their total size once the previous part get filled, or they are held by the trader, and only released as many smaller quantities as they get their fills.!<

To identify an HTP, you typically want to see refreshing limit orders (""icebergs"") at levels moving along with the market. These refreshing limit orders are usually so big that the market won't be able to go past them too much or for too long.

&#x200B;

**A practical example: facts from the ES on 2019-10-09 @11am PST**

To illustrate the behavior described above, which can help identify the presence of the HTP in the market, and therefore help the day trader avoid getting caught on the wrong side of a strong market, I wanted to show a real example.

The example is on the E-mini S&P500 futures, on the front month contract (Dec'2019 expiration), and occurred just a few moments ago.

Take a look at this chart:

&#x200B;

[ESZ9, 2019-10-09, Pacific Time](https://preview.redd.it/6jbwu4idlkr31.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=e291950102bad7f418da13ef182c3d29244d9a33)

This is a 5-min footprint chart of the ES, and the timezone is PST, so add +2 to get Chicago or +3 to get Wall Street time. The rows below are volume, delta, and cumulative delta.

>!For those unfamiliar with this kind of representation, what it is showing is the amount of volume that traded at each price level, and it is also separating the aggressive selling volume from the aggressive buying volume. If it says ""415 | 197"", for example, it means that during that 5-minute period, 415 contracts were aggressively sold for that price, while 197 contracts were aggressively bought for that price. It will color red when there's more selling aggression at a price, blue when there's more buying aggression at a price; shades represent how big the difference is. Aggressive here means that a marketable order was used â either a regular market order, or a limit order with price at or above the ask (for a buy), or at or below the bid (for a sell): the transaction is completed immediately once that order gets to the exchange. This is the opposite of a non-marketable limit order, that is, an order that goes to the order book and will have to wait in line to get filled â it will have to wait to be matched with an opposing marketable order to execute.!<

Take a look at the first yellow circle. It shows that at the 2921.25 level, at the 5-minute period starting at 11:25am PST, a total of 415 contracts were aggressively sold, while 197 were aggressively bought. A tick up, 696 contracts were aggressively sold and fewer, 432, were aggressively bought.

Going towards the right, notice how the lows of the 5-min bars are moving up.

Now take a look at the second yellow circle. Same behavior as before â considerably more contracts being aggressively sold than aggressively bought.

And you can observe the same thing happening all over that \~40 minutes sequence.

If you were to look at the real-time Order Book while this was happening, you'd have seen that there wasn't really a bid for 696 contracts at 2921.5 at any point in time during the 11:25am PST 5-min bar. **You'd instead have seen smaller orders, but refreshing**. The same behavior could be observed at the other yellow circles.

So far, **this is all factual, market-generated information**. Regardless of one's belief in one theory or another, these are the facts that are available, and that should be accounted for during the decision-making process.

Also, important to note: if you open that same chart now, so that you can see many more bars, you may see a continuation, a confirmation, or even a negation of this behavior. The fact is that while trading live, one doesn't have the luxury to look into the future. So one must act with the information available at the moment.

&#x200B;

**Interpreting the information**

*(please note: there are many theories that attempt to explain the markets, which means that many other interpretations could also be perfectly valid!)*

One way to interpret this is that **an HTP buyer came to the market**. They had to buy *a very large* number of contracts, and to do so, without spooking the market, they started using refreshing orders. The market wasn't really capable of going down more than maybe a tick or so, because that buy limit order would just refresh, and would effectively support the market.

When that HTP buyer wasn't getting the order filled anymore â because the market had moved up a bit â, **the HTP buyer moves the refreshing order to a higher level**. It will now support the market at a higher level, once again preventing it from going too much below it, as the order would immediately refresh.

And the same thing happens over, and over, and over again, during that entire period.

&#x200B;

**Making trading decisions**

Armed with the market-generated information and an interpretation such as the one above, the trader can now make decisions.

In this case, **a sound decision would be to not go against this movement**, as HTPs are usually very strong and their activity can last for quite a long time.

The practical aspects of how to use that information+interpretation could *vary from one trader to another*, especially if they trade products with different very different ""personalities"" or ""rhythms"", or if they have a very different style of trading.

Here's how I personally use that information in my everyday trading:

* If I had a **short position**, I would likely think it was time to **close it**.
* If I was **flat**, **I wouldn't want to enter a short trade**, as the HTP could continue carrying the market higher for a significant amount of time and ticks, causing me losses.
* If I was **flat**, **I would** ***not necessarily*** **want to open a long trade**, just based on the fact that I identified an HTP buyer. Just like they come to the market unannounced, they just as quickly leave the market, and then that strong support disappears!
* If I was **flat**, **I** ***may*** **enter a long trade** ***if I see other reasons to do so*** â the presence of the HTP buyer would simply act as a sort of ""additional confirmation"", but never as the sole reason for me to go long, as explained in the previous point.
* If I was **long**, I would get more confident in my trade: **I would most likely keep holding it**, to try and squeeze more profits. Like in the previous point, if I had other reasons to do so, I might even add to the long. I would manage my stop by moving it right below the low of the previous bar as each new bar forms and shows that the HTP buyer is still there.

In general, the theory considers that the One Timeframing Up process is over when the low of a new bar gets below the low of the previous bar. At that point, if I was still holding a long position like explained in the last point above, I would want to quickly re-evaluate my position to determine the next course of action. Maybe keep it, if the original reason for opening it is still valid, maybe close it if it isn't.

Everytime I go rogue, aka overtrade, pass my max daily stop trade emotionally I will keep making an entry to this post.

So, I did this last month as well and it was much worse dollar wise, but today even though the loss was not as bad I was pissed cause I repeated the same mistake. Now more specifically.

Coming in today I was looking at Apple to break to all time highs and Boeing to make a move down to 320. First trade of the day goes great on Apple. Then Boeing comes. As soon as it opened it dropped like 7 points, so I was like shiiit. However, I didnt chase and I was going to see if I can get some put options on the pullback to VWAP, a strategy that usually works very well for me. As soon as I entered short I saw the level 2 fake me out. I knew this was going to be bad. I took a loss on the trade. Nothing crazy, 50 dollars loss more than I would have liked but nothing crazy yet. So right now with the Apple and Boeing trade I was about -100 dollars on the day, my max daily stop is 200. I was still convinced however that Boeing was going to go down to 320 and that I was just faked out on the short term. So I waited. Went short again, got fucked again. Then I dont know what happened. I was just hoping for a hail mary. I tried going long after it broke above VWAP with way to many contracts, then I made a series of bad trades where I was basically getting chopped up because there was shitty volume. Then I got my self into a bear trap on nflx when it broke 270. Then I just kept making bad trades. I should have stopped so many trades ago but I was just saying to myself I just need one good trade. And I was sizing up heavy. Usually I go with like 2-4 contracts, now I was getting 7! To make a long story short ended up down 900. This is not a sob story or anything, I did not blow up my account, I just want to be held accountable and I want to read this post remind myself how shitty it feels when you let your emotions get to you.

What are your thoughts?","(As long as your entry signals try to identify non-random events and your execution rules obey sound trading principles- no martingale, no holding and hoping, riding your winners longer than your losers, etc.)

Do you disagree? Obviously the reason Iâm asking this is because Iâm still in the red, down 7% since starting to trade with real money in July. Iâm wondering what someone with years of experience actually trading (as opposed to going into higher education and developing algorithms) would think. I have a bachelorâs in cs and have considered going down that route, but canât help thinking it would be a never ending rabbit hole looking for the holy grail, as mentioned in some books.

My trading plan as of mid September consisted of just 1 setup for trend following large caps, and once Iâve learned to stop making impulsive trades and made certain adjustments in execution (taking care not to over fit or be swayed by hindsight/confirmation bias), Iâve been making 0-2 trades per day, and mostly 0 since my criteria are pretty strict (trying to identify non-random events). These trades made good money. But I didnât like the lack of opportunity, so I started working on an approach for scalping /ES and /NQ on choppy days, and itâs worked pretty well this week so far too.

Iâve gotten excited before, and I learned from it. Iâve never gotten cocky yet, though. Iâm trying to learn from othersâ mistakes instead of my own, so hopefully that wonât happen, but what is it exactly that leads people to say to expect it to take multiple years to learn how to trade? Am I eventually going to learn that itâs more complicated than this? Or is it the case that I just need to be especially wary of new sets of problems that come when one actually starts to make money that Iâm currently unaware of? Are they psychological? Does scaling up always lead to some level of failure, even if you're trading with sizes in the same proportion to your account? Will $2000 always feel like a lot of money, even if you're trading with 6+ figures, and thus lead you to make terrible decisions? Or are there different problems of a totally different nature?

t3_dm6na7,How do you know when to let your winners run?,"A few days ago I mentioned in another thread various problems that I am combating, which have been impacting my trading.   I think that I am slowly improving on risk management and looking for good setups, but I STILL have problems with not letting my winners run.

For example, on swing trades (yes, I know, this is day trading but it's related), the stock/option may go down overnight; when I am confident that it is coming back up I will buy in more, but then I tend to sell all of the combined stock/option at some profit point above the average, but less than the break-even point for the most expensive stock/option.   Yes, I make a profit overall, but not as much as I would have had I waited longer (for the most expensive stock/option to break even or even make a profit).

Similarly, I buy a stock/option during the day, it goes up, there is some degree of profit, I take the money and run.  (Day trade.)

The reason I am not letting these winners run is that I freak out at any sign of a possible reversal.   The stock has gone up a fair amount, the RSI is high (80-85), the stock price starts to slip downwards... I KNOW that it might just only be a pullback before continuing on, but I DON'T KNOW that it's not a reversal, and so I panic and sell (rather than set some stop point which, if set at a logical place, might actually be below the break-even point, never mind that I would be giving up profit).

I seem to be doing this again and again, because I have trouble discerning reversals from pullbacks.   I have tried using volume as an indicator, but more often than not, that has not been helpful.  (A spike in volume may NOT indicate a reversal, or a reversal happens without any volume spike to give me a clue.)

The candle on 10/23 indicated to me a possible pullback and when I set my order so that it'd trigger once a decrease was confirmed (it went from 3.58 down to 3.54, which is the trigger) the order was never triggered and I missed out on shortsell profit. Can anyone explain why this might have happened? Did it drop so fast that my limit order needed to be even lower than the trigger price (e.g., set trigger at 3.54, set limit at 3.53)? Thanks.

t3_dpu5kc,"Former employer offering nearly 6 figures to have me back, and working from home in the midwest U.S. majority of the week. I left 7 months ago to pursue day trading and I'm torn.","TLDR; I have absolute confidence that I will succeed in learning how to trade, but I know I won't be making what I can make right now for at least another 1-2 years. Yet I feel if I take the job now it would slow me down, and I would feel uncomfortable since I'd feel overpaid. There are also certain things about employment I just don't want to deal with right now, as entitled and ungrateful as that sounds. Would anyone be willing to share their thoughts, from personal experience or otherwise?

The knee-jerk reaction is ""take the job you idiot,"" I know. But... ever since learning about the possibilities trading has to offer, and continuing to educate myself, reading everything I could find and putting my absolute max effort into it for so long...I'm just not sure.

I began reading about trading 9 months ago, while employed there at a much lower salary, since I was entry level. I felt like I had what it takes to be successful at this (you can argue there was optimism bias here, fine). I knew it was going to be hard. I read a few books that warned me as much before even paper trading. I ultimately left 2 months later for multiple reasons- I needed to be around the house a lot more to be present for those close to me- I was away from home more than at home on weekdays- and I wanted to devote myself as fully as possible to making this work, for the freedom and to be in full control of my finances. I also just got tired of having to...talk to people. I was always a lone wolf, and never felt like I belonged in the corporate world, or anywhere, frankly.

I began trading live in July. I am currently down around 7% since starting. But I'm not discouraged at all, I feel good that I've been keeping my losses small. I've learned to be defensive. I know what my past mistakes were- first it was trading micro-cap/penny stocks on some idea that I was going to be like one unnamed guru marketing mastermind, then it was having stops that were too tight given the ATRs of the large cap stocks I switched to when I learned better, then impulsive entries not within the confines of my trading plan, then impulsive exits- exiting trades that are going against me in positions of weakness before they hit my planned stop, and also taking profits too soon (meaning, not within the confines of my plan). Most recently, I've learned that approaching automation as if it would be the answer, backtesting various strategies with the idea that once I had something work well for a large enough sample size, it would likely continue to do so, was also a mistake. I've gotten familiar with the issue of that frame of thinking and know better now.

To address my problems, I've reduced size to widen my stops so they can be more meaningful with respect to the ATRs of the assets I'm currently trading, so I'm no longer prone to getting shaken out by weak, possibly noisy, moves. I've learned to stop making impulsive entries- that just came with getting a beating enough times. I was recently struggling with taking profits too soon and closing losses in positions of weakness before my stops get hit, but I've made recent amendments to my plan to allow myself to scale out of positions in strength more often, which has let me feel much more comfortable riding out the difficult moments in a trade when the price is going against me, since often I'm able to take a partial before the first reversal or relief move, reducing my downside risk. TD reducing commissions to 0 has been a massive help, as now I'm scaling out in thirds without any worry at all, and the commissions made up about 1/5th of my early losses to begin with, the brunt of which I've taken when I didn't know nearly as much as I do now.

I've learned so much, and I feel I've made an incredible amount of progress. I've learned to scale out of my positions in strength and hold through difficult moments, not exiting in positions of weakness as long as my initial stops aren't hit- I constantly think to myself ""as long as my stops aren't touched, the trade is going exactly as planned,"" and it's helped a lot. I've learned that updating my stops too frequently is not ideal for my trend following approach, since the approach is geared for longer intraday time horizons and having pieces of my original size left to ride the longer moves, and updating stops just stopped me out in bad spots.

I am currently net positive this month, but the sample size of success is extremely small compared to the lifetime of trading I want to have, and even if it wasn't, I know that I won't be able to make as much as they are offering me at my rate until at least another 1-2 years, if I continue to trade with responsible size. And they are allowing me to work from home for the majority of the week, so I can still be present for those close to me...so it honestly feels like I have no excuse not to take the job.

I just feel...I don't know.. the pay raise they offered me before I left was comparatively really small, resulting in \~2/3ds of what they're offering now. If they really valued me at nearly 6 figures, why didn't they offer me something at least close to that in negotiations? Why wouldn't they want me to be excited to work for them? And I've always been the type to not feel confident in my abilities, so I'm not even sure I'd feel comfortable working on a salary that high.

A bit more background, I'm in my mid 20s, living in the midwest U.S. The salary they are offering is extremely high for the c.o.l. in my area, and my expenses are extremely small as it is, since I never go out and have a life. I've devoted myself fully to learning how to trade. I spend every single day working on it. I know I want to be a trader. I know that they know I want to be one too now, since I straight up told the guy who made the offer before he made the offer. And I still got offered. I'm just not sure what to do. Part of me really doesn't want to take the job since I just don't want to have to deal with certain things anymore, and really the only reason I'm considering it is because I'd be making more than I can now day trading, assuming my current rate of progress continues.

On many stocks, a large volume spike on 5 minute charts are very reliable indicators of upcoming uptrends (or downtrends).  But why do they happen at these consistently strange hours?  It has to be institutional buying right?

There are many many more of course.   On these stocks if there is a GREEN SPIKE and you buy at open and sell at 9:34 it is up most of the time..  

Am I missing something glaringly obvious here?  

Another question: As I understand it the volume spikes are green or red depending on whether selling was higher or lower but not by how much. For example if it was 51% selling and 49% buying the bar would still be red. 

Is there anywhere you can see exactly how much was selling and how much was buying?

UPDATE: for Boeing and Apple it could maybe be explained by MOC and daylight savings (changes from 4:55 to 3:55 11/04).
Donât know about the other ones.

CTL is especially strange...

UPDATE 2

Aside from their good customer service, the only thing I'm really impressed with is often getting better fills than expected and immediate execution.  Usually I am quite happy even with market orders.  But I haven't used another broker, so I wonder if Fidelity's fills/execution might be better than others or they are all about the same?

I was mostly comparing Fidelity to Schwab and TDA.  For anyone that has experience using two or three of them, how do fills/execution compare?  Am I possibly getting any advantage with Fidelity or am I only hurting myself using Fidelity?

There haven't been any updates to ATP since I signed up and it really seems like maybe they don't care much about it.  No VWAP even though people have been asking them for years, etc.

I'd also appreciate if the mobile platform (iOS) is excellent as I often travel.

This is why Tradestation won't work for me as they offer a single account per product. If I want to open Tradestation I'd have a separate account for Futures and one for Equity, makes no sense.

I've been testing Interactive Brokers platforms. Their product selection is excellent and their commissions are very low - both very good advantages but, I find their platforms to be unintuitive.

It's very convenient to be able to see immediately at a certain price, what does that level translate to in ticks or $ value. Not possible on IBKR mobile.

See proof :  https://imgur.com/SQU6Vdx. 

(Posted this in r/CanadianInvestor but only received responses from index funders) 

FULL POST : 

WHATS THE TRUTH / FIRSTLY, is day trading even viable? How many TRUE âprofessionalâ day traders transact in securities for a living (ie claim consistent profits) with PROOF?

I feel like Iâve been misguided by all these FAKE stock trader Gurus who actually make money by selling useless courses behind click funnels &amp; paywalls. 

Before I address my situation, is there any trader who can show me proof of their successes before providing advice; establish your credibility please.

MY SITUATION / I picked up interest in day trading with extra savings I gathered after investing in real estate and safer long term securities / index funds. Iâm an IT Professional with affinity for math / numbers and had $25,000 within my means of risk so I decided to give it a go. 

Admittedly, most of my âeducationâ was from my limited study of online stocks trading videos, articles, blogs, etc. I donât have a formal finance / investment banking education from an accredited institution. 

I did an independent study from July to Aug 2019 and traded with a demo account on a basic app between Aug - Oct 2019. I was able to generate over 60%  in profits in 2 months so thought I might give trading with a real account a shot. 

I used $25,000 (all within means of my risk) to day and swing trade as a real world experiment while studying techniques using my limited knowledge. Most of the stocks were energy, oil, & cannabis stocks. I lost over 50% of my portfolio in just over a month. 

To be fair and transparent, I blame losses on my lack of education and experience. I did not know how to incorporate stop losses, triggers with deltas, OCO, OTA etc. I donât have a day trading platform (like TOS, think or swim) that assists in visualizing candle sticks, MACD, RSI etc. I have the basic TD web broker platform. I take responsibility for the aforementioned. 

QUESTIONS /

1. IF day trading is actually a plausible means to generate consistent profits, where can I look to gain QUALITY education? I donât mind taking certifications or even an online diploma / university course. 

2. What techniques and key variables should I be looking for while trading / investing until I get âformallyâ educated? I need to make a 100% return to offset my loss of $13,000. Are there any stocks that I can look into which have this potential within the next year? 

3. Does anyone have suggestions on how I can build my own SYSTEM to attempt to make consistent profits?

4. Is swing trading a better approach? In my experience, this seemed a more plausible method of trading.

t3_ec7bzq,How long did it take you to become consistently profitable/is it even possible?,"Hey guys, 

I have been trading for just over an year now and sometimes I lose hope that I will ever become consistently profitable and trade for a living. I am currently a student so I work full-time in order to save up money to use for trading and whenever I lose more than usual or make a stupid mistake it really hurts because I know how hard it was to earn that money. This year I had 3 profitable months in a row through the summer but ever since then I am mostly losing and I always make the same mistakes. I either don't stick to my stop loss or after a loss I use a larger size in order to make up for it. 

Recently, I have started following my rules which are to trade max 3 trades a day and to limit my loss to $50 a day. I currently trade with a 4k account which was originally 6k in January 2019.

I think I am fixing my mistakes one by one or at least limiting them and I have noticed that when I have a lot of stuff going on in my life it also really impacts my trading and I think the reason I had 3 winning months was that I wasn't working and had a break from uni exactly at that time and I was able to follow my rules and be really disciplined. Have you noticed that in your trading as well?

I am graduating in 2020 and I have a job lined up for September 2020, however, I live in the UK and probably won't be able to trade since market open is at 2:30PM here in the middle of the day. The good thing is that I will be able to save some money and I plan to save 60k in 3 years and then quit my job and try trading full-time for 6 months and see what happens. Problem is that I worry I will lose the intuition I have build up until now and generally my market feel if I don't trade for such a long time. 

I have been thinking about maybe getting into futures since they are open all the time or trading the FTSE in the UK in the morning at 8AM when it opens.

I guess I just made that thread cos today I think I did everything well and I still lost money and I am feeling really dissapointed and starting to doubt that it is even possible to trade full-time, but it has been my dream for the past 3 years and I try to keep it alive. Those were my trades for today on MU and PCG and if I had to take them again I would probably do the same thing and I really don't see what I did wrong.

t3_ecoiwh,Support line and Resistance line? Beginner question,"So i'm practicing the art of drawing support and resistance lines and wanted some help to see if i'm following the right pattern.

&#x200B;

I included a link to trading view chart.  


My explanation: 

* I set the extreme swing high
* From Dec 3rd to Dec 13th i noticed that, since it was a bit bullish, the support increased as did the resistance and as soon at it hit either line it turned back until it hit the 13th and the resistance became the support and new resistance was at the most up swing.

I omitted any minor lines i drew for sake of simplicity.  But if i were to trade tomorrow, i would see that the new support became at around 185.01 and if it dips it might dips back to either the old support or bounce back up. However, i would look at any news that would affect Visa like the impeachment. After deciding how the news might affect the current price, i move towards furthering my analysis and watch the stock price to see it's pattern. It the Moving Average chart and RSI support what i say, then it is a good indicator that the price analysis is correct and i can plan further for my stop losses and decide when i might sell the stock for a decent profit rather than wait until the maximum point or below the daily pivot.   


Is this a right approach or should i research different strategies? This is my own that has been working with me quite a bit with paper trading but wanted to get an idea if this is a good starting strategy?

t3_ego36m,How I caught a break down on Crude Oil (/CL) Friday using ONLY order flow (no charts),"After an initial spike up at the pit open (about 20 ticks) Crude Oil came back to the open at 61.79 where it proceeded to form a 6 tick range between 61.79 and 61.74. At this point, it's just chopping around. It was doing this for about 15 to 20 minutes.   


**I went short 2 contracts at the 61.78 because of a large order below of 174 contracts at 61.62.**  


I was also watching the PACE of the market -- the market was ticking down easier than it was ticking up.   


But, at this point I was not 100% sure of the trade and still had my ""trigger finger"" on the Flatten button. 

https://preview.redd.it/3qyemo8lrb741.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa9af3d08e2d38424a0b3fd4adeb8a3a3b4a2f9c

**Suddenly a LARGE order of 201 contracts hits the ladder at 61.73.**   


Now, the order below that (175 contracts) is something I watched accumulate gradually. As the price ticked around, that area went from about 80 contracts up to 100, then 150, then 175...etc.   


So I didn't think that was anybody trying to spoof the market and bait it down to that level -- I considered that probably a legitimate order made up of lots of different people.   


But when 201 contracts hit the ladder out of nowhere, without gradually accumulating, my first thought is that this is most likely a SINGLE player trying to ""bait"" the market down.   


This gave me more confidence in my short position.

As the price moved to 61.73 where that large order is -- I saw almost the ENTIRE order suddenly move straight down to 61.67.   


On the left -- on the heat map -- you  can see that bright white (where the order was) immediately drop down (illustrated by my crappily drawn yellow arrows).  


This was INDEED someone baiting (""spoofing"") the market down. SOMEBODY -- somewhere in the world -- for whatever reason decided that they were tired of the market ticking sideways and that they wanted it to go down.  


As you can see a large number of sell orders start flooding the tape (bottom right -- set at a 15 volume filter, so only orders 15 contracts traded or over show up).

https://preview.redd.it/45fg5vplub741.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=458dce10cf117760abccbad41d919b44b41f25ec

As the price moved down  to 61.67, guess what?  


**The ENTIRE order was pulled at the last minute AGAIN and moved in its entirety down to 61.62** \-- this TRAPPED all the buyers that tried to ""front run"" that large order (twice) and they are now panic selling out of their positions causing a sell-stop run.   


You can see also on the heat map where the large order was there -- then GONE the next second (again -- ugly yellow pen for illustration). 

https://preview.redd.it/eyortz7avb741.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ea628b52c13237a274321659848c6c82f8085b

Finally -- that entire 61.62 order of 177 contracts that baited the market down DISAPPEARED again.   


But, that order below it (from the start), which had moved gradually down 2 ticks to 61.60 while accumulating even more (again -- gradually, not suddenly) got absorbed. It did not move out of the way, so it was a legitimate order.

If you're wondering what those circles are, they are areas of unusually large volume hitting market orders, in this case as soon as we got there sellers starting hitting bids aggressively.   


Sometimes, if you see large trade circles like this and they CAN'T push the market down, then it's a great indication that those sellers (or buyers) are trapped and there's going to be a stop-run in the opposite direction.   


In this case, the pace of the market was clearly to the downside and it continued for a bit:

t3_eimlxr,What are your top trading (SMART) goals going into 2020?,"Hello Folks,  


We always here this common saying, ""a new year, a new me"" during new years...   Well with day trading, there is no new me as we're always building upon what we've learned throughout the months and years of trading.  Since the markets are closed today (new years day), lets start a discussion on your top goals you are building on going into 2020.  


Let me start this off:

1. **Goal**: Stop trading within the first two minutes (9:30 - 9:32 AM)  
**Reason**: Data has shown, whenever I trade within market open, my accuracy is fairly poor (30%) which in return sets the wrong tone going into the day.  No one like starting the day red  
**Resolution**: Wait for several candles to form (whether its the 1,2,5 minute chart) to show a high probability pattern and/or approaching levels of support/resistance   
**Solution**: Inform my broker to prohibit myself from taking any trades prior to 9:32 AM.  DAS Trader Pro does have the option for time restrictions
2. **Goal**: Minimize the number of trades taken per day (over trading)  
**Reason**: Over trading can lead to several issues such as FOMO, more commissions paid, revenge trading, giving back profits, digging a deeper hole, ETC.  
**Resolution**: Ensure the trade i'm taking matches my strategy followed by a minimum of 2 amplifiers to boost my probability.  The amplifiers may include the following: changing of guard, major support levels, spike in vol, narrow range bar, etc.  
**Solution**: Inform my broker to have max shares implemented.  DAS Trader Pro does have the option for share restrictions

Once I have consistently proven to overcome these issues, I will contact my broker to remove the system generated restrictions.   

Although the issues do not happen often, circumventing these will greatly improve my overall trading!",5,0.86,1577907526,"[['MAX', 1]]",MAX,21.6200008392334,32.93000030517578

I started with a few hundred in capital on Robinhood, as I just got out of school and working full time but I wanted to get my feet wet in trading as itâs something Iâve always had interest in. 

Long term trading Iâm doing okay with but as far as short term trading (swing/day) Iâm still extremely naive on. Iâm aware of the patter day trade rule so Iâve been more interested in doing swings unless I see an opportunity that could be made in using one of my weekly day trades. I made a decent day trade the week of Christmas on MBOT and made a few hundred back when it went up 38%. It was about 90% luck with a bit of research that was just lucky on the timing of it.

t3_ejsx74,My day trading results for 2019,"So, 2019 was a bit of a rocky year. I started off making an immense amount of money, lost all of my gain shorting Qualcomm on news of their apple settlement in April. Took me months to recover, but I got stupid towards the end of the year shorting apple, thinking it HAD to go down and constantly in denial. Big share counts too. like 5 to 10000 shares short day trading

There would be enormous sums of trades to show in the whole account- but I did much better, ironically, in my account where I only day traded options.

My biggest lessons: cut the loss quickly. Don't wait, don't guess. If I had done this, i would be much more green.

Lesson two: don't let a bias overrule you. I did this w apple towards the end of the year. Fortunately I did not get carried away and start buying puts as it was going up too. CNBC pushed it higher , and I ignored this. I could have easily flipped the trade.

Lesson three: listen to your instincts. Don't get flustered or become a deer in headlights. I repeated these errors again on numerous occasions. Do not become fixated on a past price where you may have had a paper profit. Stock doesn't care about prior levels.

Also, I noticed the increasing effects cnbc can have on stocks. Lower float unusual options plays, and the time I lost on apple they kept talking of a super cycle. This just caused me to lost 40k on a short in one day. I could have covered much sooner. Not a terrible year, but I repeated these mistakes more times than I should have.

My point here is to show real results, non sugar coated. My gain on actual stock trading was, well... infinitesimal.

1a.)  When am I charged interest on the $500 I borrowed from the broker?
2. Say I buy Stock A for $2,500. I sell Stock A for $3,000 in the same day. Now if I buy Stock B for $3,000, is it using the $3,000 amount of my own money that I just gained? Or is it borrowing $3,000 from the broker as margin & I have to pay interest on that $3,000 borrowed because my funds from Stock A hasn't settled yet.  
2a.) When buying any stock, is my broker going to use my own funds first to buy the stock before using my  margin funds?
3. I actually don't want to borrow or leverage with my margin account. I just wanted the margin approval so I don't have to trade with a cash account and wait for funds to settle. Basically I'm not trying to borrow & pay interest so how do I avoid this? If I have $2,500 of my own money, do I just not buy more stocks than that amount and I'll be fine?

t3_elodwl,How you could have timed the drop on /ES and the spike on /CL perfectly using large amounts of liquidity to spot reversals.,"Someone said in this sub one time that the only reliable ""technical analysis"" is support and resistance and I'm kind of starting to agree. Since I've started down my order flow journey -- learning how to make decisions based on the actual price action and auction of the market rather than solely charts, it's easy to see WHY ""support and resistance"" is so effective.   


Here's a visual representation of the order book for Crude Oil Futures (/CL) Tuesday.   


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yi6dmoutlh941.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=300c17b60c9f9aab819ec629e33f8aaae83eabb9

There are TWO areas where LARGE amounts of liquidity are resting through the entire morning session. Up top at 63.00 and down at the bottom at around 62.05.   


You can see these represented by the very dark red lines.  


This is different from large orders that appear on the ladder in the short term. Often when people are trying to spoof the market up or down because these orders have been sitting at these levels (and accumulating more orders) for a long period.   


Here is the same area on a 15 minute candlestick chart...  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mwiafqt7nh941.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=039f4de34b7b05033f4580e533fc9a8643a22fbb

The two red lines are where that liquidity has been resting on the heat map. 

If you were relying 100% off technical analysis alone, you might have already pin-pointed areas of support where I drew those rectangles. 

**But! The real issue is -- once the price MOVES there -- are the orders going to get PULLED, is the price going to chew straight through them and break-out? Or are more buyers going to show up to defend that area and exhaust sellers?**

That's where relying on order flow on the actual price ladder is so important. 

In this case, sellers could NOT break-through that area, the resting liquidity in these areas DID NOT pull their orders off the ladder and in fact, even more buyers showed-up at the last second. 

**Personally, I took this trade -- at got out at about 40 ticks.**

But -- if I wanted to sit there longer, I could have waited until the price moved to that NEXT order of high liquidity (acting as resistance). 

And, if I had paid attention to the order flow, it would have been easy to see sellers pull their orders out of the market and step out of the way for this huge move:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5fs89u5znh941.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=f03d5548c6ae23cb7d524ec8f4c38458c7319360

I know that news had a lot to do with this, but in reality you don't even need to understand what's happening in the news to make pin-pointed, laser-focused decisions based on what the literal price action is telling you. 

**I TOOK ANOTHER TRADE ON /ES where I was able to use this same general strategy to catch the EXACT reversal of ES to the downside.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/111rfpp9oh941.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=91adbcd92728ba64b0b9c638ba95b710a0c743d2

As you can see, /ES trended up for most of the morning, but when it got to 3245.00 a LARGE amount of sellers showed up -- almost 500.  


But what's important to notice is to the left -- you see two more deep-red lines up top which show a similar amount of large sellers. 

BUT -- they pulled their orders out of the market and disappeared -- allowing the price to move further up. 

It wasn't until the price reached 4245.00 that these sellers showed back up and this time they STAYED there and continued to push the price down the ladder. 

**I took a short position here. Again, I could have waited longer for the price to move to that next largest amount of resting orders (Price moves TO and THROUGH liquidity), but I got out at a 5 point gain.** 

Looking at it on a standard 5 minute candlestick chart -- anybody that is paying attention to general S/R technical analyses may have made the same decision as me...  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ux3m0c10qh941.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=69fc87f0318927347a8272751bec2f73ff2f4fa1

Those two red lines indicate the two large areas of resting liquidity showed on the Heatmap before.   


As you can see, after price moved down to that OTHER area of resting liquidity at 3350.50 the buyers successfully forced the price back up until they eventually pulled out of the way and let the sellers take over. 

**What I've found is that standard technical analyses works GREAT -- but if you pair double confirm that those areas have large amounts of resting liquidity, then you can pin-point an entry.** 

**And THEN, once the price moves to that area -- if you can direct your attention to the DOM and watch the price action you can make your final decision to enter based on whether or not the liquidity at that level is holding, pulling their orders out of the market, or if they are being chewed through without any resistance.**   


This way, you can solve a few problems...  


* You don't have to just ""accept"" that resistance or support didn't hold and take a loss -- you KNOW that support/resistance isn't holding BEFORE you take a trade
* You don't have to worry about NOT getting filled -- it sucks to put an order in at an area of support/resistance, just for the price to move ALMOST there, and reverse amazingly and you missed out on it. THIS way, seeing where the actual liquidity is resting (and whether or not it has started to move down the ladder more aggressively) allows you to know EXACTLY where the turning point is.
* News events are REFLECTED in REAL-TIME in the price action. You don't need to have squak boxes and streaming news services barraging you with down-to-the-second broadcasts -- the price action will simply tell you what's happening.

I have been doing research the last couple of days on different futures brokerages and have narrowed it down to NinjaTrader, TastyWorks, TradeStation, and AMP. From what I have read and tested myself they each have their pros and cons, but I am curious to see what your personal experience is with these brokers (or a different one if you highly recommend it). 

NinjaTrader I have used to backtest different strategies and am familiar with the software, I just donât like how you have to pay to use it (I could still use TOS, but ideally I would like a broker that has everything so thereâs no discrepancies).

TastyWorks seems to have good pricing, platform, and reviews, but Iâm not sure how many are endorsed reviews and am a little deterred at how new they are. However, Iâm open to hearing your experience and thoughts.

Tradestation has been around for a while and seems to have mixed reviews. Their pricing works with my requirements, and I had initially planned on going with them, but they seem to be all over the place.

AMP is one I came across recently and there doesnât seem to be a whole lot on them. People either really love them or really donât like them. I like how you can connect to them with different charting software and their pricing seems pretty competitive, but like I said I canât find a whole lot on them.

As you can see, I am indecisive on which to go with and would like to know your experience, thoughts, and opinions to aide in making a decision. I would really appreciate any information you can provide!

t3_f2gmda,Stop Loss Order Cancellation Pending??,"Hello,

First time poster here; I'll get straight to the point.

I played a bounce in BBBY yesterday with an average price of $14.25 and a stop loss at $14.15. During market hours, it ended up bouncing and closed up around 4%. Good. I was happy, and I thought it could rise more tomorrow before I eventually close the position for a quick swing.

However, after-hours, their CEO decided to drop a bombshell. Doesn't matter the news; something about a earnings warning of sales down 5%. The stock immediately dropped 16%. I was deterred, kicked myself, and vowed to not enter long positions in shitty companies in the future (not sure if profanity is allowed on this sub. Hope I didn't break the rules). Even though I knew my stop loss wouldn't trigger AH, I wasn't panicking. The plan was to just manually exit the position AH and move on.

When I tried to sell AH at a loss, it said I couldn't do so because I have an open order on the position. Duh, the stop loss! So I went and tried to cancel the stop loss order, but instead of cancelling the order, it told me the order cancellation was pending. What?? When does a freaking order cancellation pend? So I sit there refreshing for 5 minutes; 10 minutes; 15 minutes; all the while watching the stock price go further and further down and unable to do anything about it. I called their support team, and they told me the team responsible for cancelling those order went home at 4 pm. So they have people manually cancel stop loss orders??? This can't be a best practice.

As a result, when I wanted to exit at around $12.25 a share at 4:30 pm EST, I now have to wait until tomorrow morning. As of 5:30 pm EST, the price per share is now $11.25. I lost another 10% or so because of what I view as inadequacy from the broker.

So now, my question is, is this all legal?? Can they hold my position for ransom like that?? If I'm SOL, then let me at least share the broker with you: Ally Invest. Don't work with them. They're trash.

t3_f6iqtn,Major issue with OCO bracket orders on thinkorswim. Donât make the same mistake,"Small background: I started placing OCO bracket orders when I find stocks gapping up in the morning pre-market. I figure out my entry price for when the market opens and place a buy stop order, place a sell stop order for my stop loss and finally I place a sell limit order to take profits at my profit target. It worked well a few times but on my order today with ENPH everything went horribly.

Long story short, my buy stop order was triggered followed by my sell limit order at my profit target in a matter of seconds. I thought I was out of the trade at this point because it was an OCO bracket order. However, my stop loss order also was triggered during this whole ordeal (even though I had an oco bracket in place) and I found myself shorting ENPH. I scrambled to figure out what was happening and ended up buying back ENPH which put my several thousands in the whole.

I called thinkorswim support and after communicating with them several times they were able to confirm my story and after several hours were able to place the majority of the funds back in my account. They told me itâs the one and only time theyâll do this for me. When I asked how I could avoid this in the future they recommended that I donât use OCO orders anymore and to use limit orders.

What can I do to avoid all of this in the future? What order types? And how do I protect myself without OCO orders on thinkorswim? Are other brokers better?

t3_f8g0ig,My two cents for scalping.,"Support and resistance is everything. 200, 100, 50 and 20 minute SMAs, Bollinger bands, parabolic SAR and Fibonacci retracements. Look at major price points over the day, 2 day, 5 day and 10 day chart. Make sure you are aware of crucial support and resistance points for the last 6 mos , year and two year charts. Also for a day chart - volume weighted average pricing (VWAP) overlay gives you the tradersâ conviction in these price points - in other word substantiates the support or resistance point for you (how much conviction in that particular price floor or ceiling). So if youâre bullish and the stock breaks through a high volume price point (resistance) you can scalp the surge in price. 

The algorithms are all written by the same Ivy League grads that were taught by the same Ivy League curriculum. Once you figure this out, what patterns they are looking for and which stocks they meddle in, you have an advantage. Trade popular stocks and leveraged etfs that other day traders are playing with as well, and the probabilities of your move will increase substantially. 

Lastly you can go the other direction, and choose a stock or etf that has a big move overnight and trades around 1-3 M shares the next session. As it makes its big move up or down for the day (usually eithin the first 30 mins of trading) it will build its first significant support or resistance point for the day. As it reverts and then extends back toward that new price point,  you can read the level II quotes to get a sense of supply and demand for the current bid and ask. You get to see the inventory (how many shares) are at each limit price. As market orders come in and take out the current bid or ask - you can see which side (bulls or bears) are taking over the market (bid/ask). Couple this with a support and resistance strategy I explained above and you increase your chance even more. Note this only works for stock and etfs with lower volume, bc with higher volume, the level II quotes are moving too fast to get a grip of whoâs driving the market and which price direction the stock is going.

**TRIL** Closed strong over $5.00 w/ the daily chart breakout - one to watch Monday/Tuesday (if Monday is used as consolidation) -- watch over $5.50 w/ volume to push back towards highs and over $6

**TRIB** CV play idea, CO is profitable and chart looks nice. Needs to hold trend over $1.20 in  the coming days and push over $1.80 with volume to get started with a big move. $2.00 is a key level over $1.80. 

**CBAY ** Moving averages lining up nicely on the daily for this one. Could be  a nice swing off the bottom key support off $1.55 area and push up to break $1.80s, then $2.00. One to keep on watch, it moves a bit slower so set a few price alerts and leave it! There's a large gap to fill over $2.20 which has worked well in the market lately.

**BIOC** Traded record volume on Friday and closed up 168% -- I'll be watching this one for continuation Monday morning off the key level of $0.60, we need to see a gap hold above that level and form higher lows towards the $1.00 level for the best case scenario breakout run.

**SPCE** Everyone has had their eyes on this one and it has pulled back hard since that $40 blowoff move. Watching this week for a bounce, as we are teetering over a key support level at $20.00 with likely a few short covering coming in. Not a bad R/R here towards $30 area.

**OGEN** Long this one on Friday @ $0.62. Gearing up on the daily chart towards the psychological level of $1.00. Expecting P2 data soon, so that's why we are seeing this volume come in - plus the sub $1 theme is hitting since Thursday/Friday. I'd like to see a gap up Monday morning and shove over $1.00 with volume for a nice run.

**NH** Breaking out on the daily chart with a positive reaction to ER on Friday. Technically speaking this stock looks great over the $2.50 level for a run towards the $3.00 area.

Ticker: $SPY

Intervals: 1W, 1D, 1H

Indicators: Aroon, RSI, MA(200 & 50), ATR, NetVolume, News Catalysts

Signals: 1W Aroon Signal Bullish, NetVolume Overwhelmingly Bearish, Under 200 & 50 MA Bearish  
 Position: Short Term $244p 3/20 & Long Term $225p 4/3 

Targets: Take most of your profit at 243 and let some of your calls ride when it dips under.

News: âStock futures plunged Sunday night even after the Federal Reserve embarked on a massive monetary stimulus campaign to curb slower economic growth amid the coronavirus outbreak. While the central bankâs actions may help ease the functioning of markets, many investors said they would ultimately want to see coronavirus cases peaking and falling in the U.S. before it was safe to take on risk and buy equities again.

Stock market futures hit âlimit downâ levels of 5% lower, a move made by the CME futures exchange to reduce panic in markets. No prices can trade below that threshold, only at higher prices than that down 5% limit.,"" (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/traders-await-futures-open-after-fed-cuts-rates-launches-easing-program.html)  
 

TLDR; The fed cut rates to zero and futures still bombed.   
 

Analysis: 1W and daily signals have not changed significantly since my last analysis. 1W & 1D aroon still giving sell signals. Net Volume is -1.5G signaling overwhelming bearish investor sentiment. Volumetric support/resistance plotting give weak support around $243 and almost no accumulation thereafter until $200

t3_fli34w,Noob trying to trade: Risk/Reward and Probability,"hi,

since i  lost about 2/3 of my capital on my journey to become rich, i thought it would be a good idea to begin learning about risk / reward and probability.

for this i asked myself this very simplified and probably unrealistic trade: would be a good idea to buy at 21:00 UTC after a bearish day in the EURUSD market, go to sleep and sell the next day at 06:00 UTC.

so i checked the last week, of which 6 ended with a lower close than open. the next morning 4 of the six days opened higher than the evening before closed, two opened without significant change. In none of these days, the price went further down after a bearish day.


|Overnight| Chance | event / days |
|---------|--------|--------------|
|Rising   | 0.666 | 4 / 6 |
|Equal    | 0.333 | 2 / 6 |
|Falling  | 0.0 | 0 / 6 |


The probability is therefore, 0.666 that tomorrow morning, the eurusd price will be higher than today 21:00 UTC.

I ""bought"" at exactly 21:00 UTC. For the reward i took the next resistance. The stop loss is a bit below the current level of a small side-ways range.

Therefore:

| Trade | Price |
|-|-|
|Buy | 1.06860 |
|Sell/TP | 1.07537 |
|SL | 1.06523 |
|Reward | 0.00677 |
|Risk | 0.00365 |

The Risk/Reward Ratio is 1.8558. Not really high, but the chance to take that profit home is 66.6%. given backtests revealed that 66.6% is a valid chance over the long term, 65 pips is a realistic overnight profit and 36.5 pips is a sl suitable for the volatility during the night and given i'd automate the trade blindly, i'd make:

|Long Term P/L | pips |
|--------------|------|
| Winning | 44.68 | 
| Losing | 12.045 |
| Avg | 32.635 |

32.635 pips a night in bearish / recover nights. or assuming bullish and bearish days are about the same over unlimited time, then it would be half of it.

SPY still hanging out around support. We are seeing  buying happening pre market with buyers stepping in at 218. Still a chance this support level holds. So far this is looking like it could be a choppy day. If the market drops, these bounces we saw last week in most stocks can turn into dead cat bounces and I'll look to try and short them back to support. If the market stays strong we may see a continuation of strength. I'll be focusing on TQQQ as I feel it will have a range and may move cleaner than individual stocks. Being patient in this market.  If the market falls, here are the circuit breaker levels.

Most stocks are sitting on Moving averages or gapping into resistance/moving averages. If the market falls, some of these bounces we have seen can turn into dead cat bounces but they could also bounce off of the moving averages they are sitting on and try to remount them to continue higher.

t3_fryh9b,Stock Watch Analysis - Day Results and Next Day Plays,"I thought I would give my take on what I saw today and what I am watching for tomorrow.

Canadian Oil companies changing the trend - I talked before how I suspect CPG - crescent point energy, was developing an [inverse head and shoulders pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2qilRpA2/).   Today I also noted that SU - suncor energy and CNQ - Canadian Natural Resources had big days (up 15% and 18%).  All 3 names are looking for their first bullish trend change since the drop with CNQ right on the door followed by SU and CPG.  It will be short term bullish if they break tomorrow.

Gold Miners - BTO - B2Gold Corp; ELD - Eldorado Gold; YRI - Yamana Gold, K - kinross gold - all first broke hourly uptrend and now their 4 hour uptrend.  Now we look for the daily.  I suspect they will hold daily uptrend given how hard they bounced.  If they fall another 5% tomorrow, I would begin to look at scaling in for a bounce and then play range.

CGC/WEED - I thought this needed major daily consolidation after how much it bounced off bottom.  Yet it has only pulled back 5% in two days.  I believe SPY being strong has helped.  If SPY remains bullish we could see test of top from 2 days ago, weakness and I believe consolidation will be underway.

Other notes - BBD.B - Bombardier gave back 2 days of bounces in 2 days.  Support is multiple daily supports up to $0.38.  Worth trying for a bottom fishing play with a tight stop.

&#x200B;

For 2018 their 1099 statement claims I made 400k (only for example purposes, not the real number) (net) after factoring in wash loss disallowed. My true number was about 1/4 of that or 100k (as calculated on a mark to market basis). In 2018 I did thousands of short term scalps on less than 10 of the same equities, almost always closing out all positions before the end of the day. Because 2018 was the first real year that I was doing any substantial trading, I was unaware of the implications of wash loss sales so I just carried on trading the full year, almost every day, always the same securities. Because I traded the entire calendar year, a very large portion of my losses were caught in the wash loss rule, rendering my total tax liability to be 4x higher than it should have been. These losses were then carried forward into 2019 where they show up on my broker's 1099 as -300k even though, once again, I should have had a net profit that year on a mark to market basis. 

&#x200B;

The problem, of course, is that I am stuck paying taxes on 300k in gains I never actually made for 2018. I want to know if there is any kind of recourse here or if I'm just SOL. The preliminary consensus from my CPA and a few other people hasn't been very favorable; they seem to think I'm SOL, but they are also puzzled by how there isn't a way out of this. To me this tax treatment seems very unjust for situations like my own. 

&#x200B;

What if I had been trading more aggressively and more actively, trading a single security back and forth all year long? My balance could end up flat at 100k and I could receive a tax bill for 800k in gains, if enough of the losses are stuck as disallowed wash sales.

Usually the couple weeks before earnings get slow as everyone awaits releases of reports. Trading will pick up soon, in the meantime we just trade what we can. Due to the lack of gappers, it is a good idea to run a scan after the market opens to find stocks to trade. Market above $250 psychological support is a good sign, have to see if it holds here. if not, most likely it will test the 234 support or maybe even the previous low.

I am quite new to trading options. I find myself in a weird situation. If someone could help me figure this out I would be eternal grateful (because Robinhood email system is slow and useless..)

I bought two $94 strike PUT against UTX (pre-merger/split) with a expiration at May 1st at $8.00 per contract

The merger has happened.. Now my put is called RTX3 

Now I don't understand the value of the put. The volume has gone to 0 and the bid ask spread is from $3.00 to $15.00... Robinhood app suggests its green 100, however it will not sell due to bid ask spread and volume issues.

My contracts (2) amount is unchanged and number of shares per contract is still 100. How ever i do not understand the value of the underlying since it is now broken into 3 stocks; RTX, OTIS, and CARR.

I read the underlying is split 55% into rtx, 20% carr, and 25% otis. This may be helpful.. But I am struggling with figuring it out.

Is my put worthless now? Is it valuable and i need to just hold till volume increases? Can i exercise for a profit?

t3_fxgir6,| Community Trading Journal 4/8 | Review each other's daily trades with TA,"Hey folks,

I am looking to share trades after market close so we can see from each others perspectives and possibly gain some insight on different trading styles. My overall idea would be to do this a few times a week. This is not to brag or rag on each other, just to simply bounce ideas and analyze and improve each others trading abilities. 

I'll lead with my examples of the day, showing 1-2 winners and losers  I learned from and explaining my thought process was (If you use indicators part of your signals, it would be helpful if you included what you use). Please use EST for time of entry.

Indicators/Timeframes: VWAP, RSI, MACD, 9EMA | I mostly look at the 2 min, but always double check the 5 min and 1 min. 

**Reversal (L)**: PINS @ 9:43 Long $16.09 Stopped out @ 15.96 - Resistance at 16.02. Thought I saw a reversal coming in with longer wicks down, and RSI indicating oversold. 

**Reversal (W)**: PINS @ 10:07 Long $16.06  Stop @ 15.89  Target @ 16.55 - Same as above, retrying the pattern after 3rd bounce on resistance. Hit target. Wish I scaled in but was fairly choppy, I managed my risk but moving my stop 5c below each higher low. 

**Reversal (W)**: VIPS @ 10:22 Long $15.26 Stop @ 15.03 Target @ 15.83 - Locked in profit before target, was uncomfortable after blowing past a support line. What I saw momentum slowing on prior bars, increased volume, and SPY trending up showing a sign of market strength. Also had a confirmation from MACD / RSI oversold. 

**HOD Short (L)**: ABBV @ 14:20 Short $77.89 Stop out @ 77.97 Target @ 77.15 - Stopped out early. Overbought on RSI, was showing signs of a break, and I sometimes try to ""top fish"" HODs. This one did not work out. I'm not going to write out the rest of the times I tried throughout the the day, but this was my largest loser because I kept going in. IN hindsight, it never broke the 9 ema, and was correlated tightly with SPY which was also in a strong uptrend today. 

I made about 10 other trades today. I was up 3x over my daily target, and ate away at it toward the end of the day, erasing all my gains by trading emotionally. The biggest lesson I have today is to walk away when I reach my target. I was trading emotionally due to my losses last week and trying to ""make up"" for those. I also have too much time with not much to do for obvious reasons so I kept at it hoping my winning streak would continue. This is important to recognize in ourselves to build discipline. 

If this gets some good conversation going and is found helpful, I'll do it everyday I have time. I do this in a journal anyways so I am trying something different.

FULL DISCLAIMER: I am a new trader, this is my 7th week.

t3_fyqiny,Are IB's fills and executions really that amazing and worth the cost?,"I love the great fills and instant executions on Fidelity with zero commissions, but I have not used any other broker yet to compare.  Fidelity apparently doesn't like very frequent traders and is closing my account.

Everyone seems to talk about IB's fills and executions, but I don't really see much direct comparison to other brokers.  With a relatively high frequency scalping strategy, trade commissions like IB has scare me.  I honestly can't imagine the fills being better than Fidelity, but hopefully fills must at least be as good.

I guess my question may be more so are most other brokers really that much worse?  And will IB's trade commissions mostly be cancelled out by price improvement?  The typical trade for me is 400 to 1,000 shares of a very liquid $40 large/mega cap stock with almost no spread.

What really helped my strategy with Fidelity was consistently being able to get in and very quickly out of trades for the price I paid (commonly even filled for 1 cent gain), if the quote hadn't moved, all while using market orders.  I did that if something changed like market looked like it was reversing, L2 was turning around, or I made a mistake in order.  Plus zero commissions helps allow for adding to position or reducing position size rather than going all in/out.

I'm mostly looking at IB (IBKR Pro) and TradeStation (TS Select).  TradeZero US is a possibility, but it seems less likely.  I just signed up with Schwab to at least have some broker so I can get back to trading after completely missing S&P 500's best week of gains in 46 years.  But after getting kicked off Fidelity, it seems for scalping I'll be safer with a platform aimed towards more active traders.

Iâm a new trader, and over the last week or so Iâve started getting familiar with MACD and RSI indicators, how they correspond with price action, and what they indicate about when to enter and exit, generally. I can see the value of those indicators for intraday trading; unfortunately, I donât have $25k in equity right now, and so I need to work with the limited equity I have right now, holding positions overnight and hoping to make a play the next morning.

So I ask: are there any specific indicators that you use when looking for securities that you will hold positions on overnight? Iâm not looking for the secret ingredient for overnight gappers, just looking for wisdom as to the indicators (and the intervals) that you tend to use when youâre looking for securities. Especially in light of the marketâs current volatility, I realize how naive it would be to blindly start holding positions overnight.

t3_g2fh2w,"How to Daytrade Without $25,000","TLDR: Get a cash account.

A  lot of people complain about the 3 day trades per 5 trading days rule for accounts with less than 25K. Those complaints are  completely understandable. However, there is a way to get around that  rule without having 25K in your account.

(Obviously if you have a $25,000 account, then you don't need to read this post.)

This works with most cash accounts, but I'll be talking about [thinkorswim by TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim/features.page) since that's what I use.

Create  an account on TD Ameritrade. It needs to be a cash account with options  trading level 2 enabled. Margin privileges should NOT be enabled.

Here's what day trading is like with a cash account:

For  example, let's say you have an account of the size $1,000. On Monday,  you buy calls for $200 and sell those calls on the same day for $500.  You just made a $300 profit. Your account is now worth $1,300. Now, you  won't be able to use the $500 you made on this day trade for the entire  rest of the Monday. You'll be able to use those funds on Tuesday.  However, you still have $800 that you can use to day trade on Monday.  You can basically keep day trading until available funds reaches 0 for  that day. Then, those funds free up the next day and you repeat. This  prevents you from force trading and over trading.

Here's the best part...

You  can also open up a thinkorswim margin account. Link it both ways with  your cash account. You now have the ability to instantly transfer your  funds to margin account and vice versa. Transfer all of your funds to  the thinkorswim margin account, and use up the 3 day trades on this  account. You can't use margin to trade options so don't worry about  interest or anything like that. Once you've used up your 3 day trades,  use the instant transfer feature to transfer all of your funds from  margin account to your cash account. Now day trade as many times until  buying power reaches 0. Once your 3 day trades come back on the margin  account, instantly transfer all funds from cash account to margin  account. Use up the 3 day trades here, then transfer back to cash.

Here's the bad part...

You  have to pay commissions of .65 cents per contract. However, once you've  placed enough trades on this platform and you day trade often, you can  always negotiate with the broker to lower your fees.

The  UI is nowhere as good as Robinhood. However, you can try thinkorswim on  an iPad, it looks a bit cleaner... but nothing close to Robinhood's UI.  Robinhood will always have the best UI, imo. Unfortunately, Robinhood  only offers margin account.

Conclusion...

This  setup allows you to day trade with a bit more freedom. It's not close  to having 25K account and day trading, but it's still pretty damn good.

If  you need help setting anything up, just contact thinkorswim support  team via the mobile app. Or, just PM me and I can try to help. There's  also a countless number of videos and articles that can help you as  well.",111,0.9,1587045790,"[['TD', 2], ['UI', 1]]",TD,39.619998931884766,39.0

t3_g25kal,Market Analysis* 3X ATH - 200 SMA TEST - 3 ATH,"Just a quick observation and analysis I put together for our team.

We've made 3 All Time Highs from the 218 SPY lows. Each High came with some chop and consolidation before a gap fill / break of neckline to make new highs.

I noticed that after the 3rd High (Retest of highs) we shortly consolidated after testing the 200SMA for 3 consecutive days before building up enough support volume to take us through the same pattern of making 3x new highs with consolidations. 

We've now broken over the 50SMA and it looks like we could be headed towards a 200SMA test again which could chop for another few consecutive days. Notice the dates that thursday / friday seem to be flat or sell off days with a ripping monday.

Will have to monitor the price action , volume to see if there's any support or buyers stepping in at the 200SMA retest otherwise it will be another 1 week trend. 

It also seems like anybody that was stuck on the wrong side of the trade eventually came out on top if patient enough. (Assuming they bought 60-90 DTE options)

t3_g3sbct,Fidelity Active Trader Pro for day trading,"Hello,

I have been using Fidelity as my brokerage platform for several years for passive investing only. I recently started doing intraday trading and using their active trader pro (ATP) platform. I am finding some limitations with their platform, and wanted to check whether there are others on this forum that use ATP for a lot of day trading and what their experience is.

Some of the limitations that I've run into:

1) For stocks that have gapped up pre-market, it does not allow me to submit an OTOCO (one triggers one cancels other) order where the stop loss price is higher than the previous days closing price. For example, if a stock closed at $5 yesterday, has gapped up to $6 in premarket, if I want to enter an order to buy the stock at $6.05, and simultaneously enter a sell order at $6.50 and a stop loss order at $6.02, ATP doesn't allow that because it detects the stop loss price of $6.02 to be higher than last price of $5.

2) Not able to configure hotkeys to enter an order with a click of a button. Though APT provides level 2 quotes, and has shortcut keys on the level 2 screen, it will requires you to type and select the various options when entering an order. 

3) The charts appear to slow down or freeze for a few seconds before refreshing.

If anyone else on this forum is using ATP for active day trading, I would like to hear your feedback and whether you have been able to workaround the issues listed above. I have called Fidelity a number of times but could not get a solution on these. They mentioned I look at Wealth Lab Pro, but it appears that is a strategy testing platform and not a day trader platform.

I like the Fidelity platform otherwise, and would hate to switch to another broker. Not only are all my investments in one place with Fidelity, but they are one of the lowest cost brokers out there.",4,1.0,1587234341,"[['APT', 1]]",APT,13.300000190734863,14.289999961853027

He's strategy consists of trading the SP mini features, he basically scalps for 1 point, 3 contracts that makes him $150 per point. It seems a good strategy as he only needs to hit the target. But my interest is his strategy, does anyone know or understands his ""two legged pullback"" strategy? He relies a lot on this and does a lot of emphasis on it, he says he has a win rate of 90-95% whenever he decides to entry a trade based on this strategy. I also find interesting that he somehow seems to know or predict when short sellers gonna be trapped and also longs, then he places he's entries. How do one know when will short or long be trapped? I really think this is how, or at least 1 way experts REALLY trade and he is spealling the beans with this one. There's a LOT of info about trading on yt and people selling their courses but I've always had the feeling they just teach you 80-90% of the way, and their true profitable strategies, they keep to themselves because why would they teach other people that basically will become their competition, a way to profit? If they do, and if more people learn a strategy, it's more likely the strategy begins to lose its effectiveness.

That being said, i think this Michel Chin guy strategy is legit, i also think he might have other strategies and he just decided to give this one out, but i find it really interesting because ever since i started this journey learning trading, I've always had the notion that the key of all this trading thing is to understand, to REALLY understand the psychology of the charts, of every candlestick, and based on that, react and predint the next moves, until now I've never found anyone with this type of approach on internet, yes few advanced traders on yt have kinda of an idea but generally they don't talk about it deep enough like i would like to, idk if they lack the knowledge or just don't want to reveal this key information to the public.

t3_g470q9,How I use RSI VS how people use RSI,"RSI basically shows the strength of the market. There are Overbought zone (70+) and Oversold zone (30-).
Iâve seen many people using RSI based on these signals, looking at if the market is oversold or overbought, and then selling if they think it has gone up âtoo muchâ and RSI is overbought or selling if it has gone done âtoo muchâ and RSI is oversold, sometimes they use divergence to take a position.
Well, this is the wrong way to go, let me show you why.
So, this is Microsoft, you can see these divergences in many charts in low or larger timeframe. Iâve chosen this one because it was the most representative: https://www.tradingview.com/x/yQhzldpo/

So, you could have seen the divergence and say, ok market is losing strength while prices are going up, this is not good.
Or you could have seen the divergence, tell to yourself, ok we are in an uptrend and we are seeing a divergence in a large timeframe, I must be careful. We are in an uptrend, so I apply the strategy, I still have a buying strategy but Iâm careful. In this way, you would have to keep your position on the side of the market, while being cautious and taking fewer risks.
What happened is that the trendline on the RSI that was based on the divergence, have been broken. This is a strong signal that the divergence will not be played and will not transfer into a downtrend. This is a signal that shows that the market is not ready to dump, is not losing strength.
What I do with RSI, is that I use it to see where the trend is going, and I use the neutral zone, and I just follow the trend. I donât use it as a tool to counter the trend, I use it to follow it and identifying dips and selling point. I use also support and resistance and wait for a RSI signal coupled with a stochastic signal together (they work very well together) and take a position like that.
I hope that helped some RSI users, and Iâm happy if you werenât doing that mistake!

t3_g89yj8,Theoretical Day Trading Strategy for Options on /ES -- Thoughts? Love it? Hate it?,"So I have an idea for a strategy and would love to hear what anyone here thinks!  Basically it involves day trading near expiration (2/3 days or so out) options on /ES, essentially using options to clamp losses and trade intra-day trends on /ES.  Additionally, opening a near expiration (2/3 days or so out) long strangle shortly after 3pm EST and holding it open until the next day closing it shortly before 3pm EST to capitalize solely off of a day's movement (rinse and repeat).  The active trading would be to hedge against theta decay on the long strangle and any extra profit would just be take home.

I ran some numbers on SPX (more easily accessible for me than /ES) and over the past 4 months the average daily move was 45 points from open to close with a standard deviation of 41 points, a median of 28 points, a min of 0.21 points and a max of 150 points.

So with an average move of 45 points, using the distribution on a normal curve for our data, 68% of the point move would be between 86 and 4 -- 27% of the point move would be between 127 and 86 as the upper portion as well as between 4 and 0 as the lower portion -- 4.5% would be between 168 and 127 as the upper portion and the range for the lower portion would lie essentially at zero -- 0.5% would be outliers of large or small values.

So with 20 trading days in the month, 14 days would be in the 68% range, 5 days would be in the 27% range and 1 day would be in the 4.5% range.

So if we know our ranges we could then take the median between the ranges, converted into profit margins and multiply it by the number of days.

So the middle values would be as follows:

Upper Range of 4.5%: 147.5 point move

Upper Range of 27%: 106.5 point move

Upper Range of 68%: 65.5 point move

Lower Range of 68%: 24.5 point move

Lower Range of 27%: 2 point move

Lower Range of 4.5%: 0 point move

&#x200B;

Converting to profit margins would then result as follows using a 4/27 expiration Long Strangle evaluated with values at 4/24 with a 2785 Put and a 2875 Call with SPY at 2828 (a width of roughly 45 points in either direction) with a theo debit of $588 to get a value of approximately 0 in the event of absolutely no net movement:

(note all loss margins due to time decay are theoretical and are calculated using Decay = Theta x Notional, in which case Theta = theo theta, and Notional = 50 for the underlying /ES)

Upper Range of 4.5%: $4637.80 at 2680.50, with a theo theta of -0.36 ($18.00 lost to theta decay)

Upper Range of 27%: $2707.82 at 2721.50, with a theo theta of -1.80 ($90.00 lost to theta decay)

Upper Range of 68%: $1112.11 at 2762.50, with a theo theta of -3.97 ($198.50 lost to theta decay)

Lower Range of 68%: $166.36 at 2803.5â¬0, with a theo theta of -5.40 ($270.00 lost to theta decay)

Lower Range of 27%: $1.60 at 2826, with a theo theta of -5.67 ($283.50 lost to theta decay)

Lower Range of 4.5%: -$0.23 (theo zero, thrown out) at 2828, with a theo theta of -5.68 ($284.00 lost to theta decay)

&#x200B;

We would then multiply these by the number of days:

Upper Range of 4.5%: 0.5 days

Upper Range of 27%: 2.5 days

Upper Range of 68%: 7 days

Lower Range of 68%: 7 days

Lower Range of 27%: 2.5 days

Lower Range of 4.5%: 0.5 days

&#x200B;

Resulting in:

Upper Range of 4.5%: $2318.90 with cumulative theta decay of $9.00

Upper Range of 27%: $6769.55 with cumulative theta decay of $225.00

Upper Range of 68%: $7784.77 with cumulative theta decay of $1389.50

Lower Range of 68%: $1164.52 with cumulative theta decay of $1890â¬.00

Lower Range of 27%: $4.00 with cumulative theta decay of $708.75

Lower Range of 4.5%: theo $0.00 with cumulative theta decay of $141.75

&#x200B;

Note these calculations do not account for vega, bid-ask spreads, or fills, which will apply some differences to this being written out in theory versus happening in a real life situation.

Added together we get that this strategy should monthly generate approximately $18041.74, not including commission.  We would have a cumulative theta decay of $4364 monthly.  So if you'd intend to not try and offset theta decay with day trading, your theo profit would be $13677.74 monthly with current market volatility.

&#x200B;

However, I think that it would be perfectly viable to day trade futures options to offset theta decay.  You'd only need to generate an average of $218.20 each day (after commissions) in profits from day trading to offset theta decay.  (Shoot for $283.50 to cover the max theoretical loss due to theta)

&#x200B;

Of course it would be necessary to position size and not risk too much for day trading futures options.  I'm going to be experimenting with $100 per trade with only trading one option at a time OTM.  This way if your trade really shot against you (news or whatnot), you wouldn't stand to lose a major portion of your account.

&#x200B;

Anyways!  This to me feels like a reasonable strategy, but I'd love to hear what you think!  Do you love it?  Hate it?  Let me know!  Thanks, and have a great rest of your day/night.

t3_ga9gl4,Finding Winners & Still Having a Life,"Screening for stocks is a core tool that should help you create a  trading model that helps you focus, and not get get consumed by bad habits.

Itâs taken a number of years for me to  tune, experiment and personalize my trading experience â as you know,  trading truly is a philosophical journey. What works for some, may be  poison to others.

The truth is however, even if I gave my  full strategy, screening process and risk criteria away, people would  still lose money. There are thousands of good strategies out there but  if they donât align with your personality, it be like taking a job you  hate just for the money. Good for a while but not a passion you will  stick with through thick and thin.

Being 100% transparent, I only follow my own strategy about 80% of  the time! (*Which is still an achievement*). If I did follow it all the  time I would have an additional 0 on the end of my net worth, at least.

Trading is not as black and white as a finding high RS stocks, there is a ton of [experiential knowledge](https://redpilltrades.com/true-trading-knowledge-is-experiential/)  required to find out what works, and what doesnât. It is a nice start  though to at least tune your eye into winning price patterns.

At the very least, it eliminates the worst stocks, which in itself is a valuable starting point.

Screening for stocks and building some basic logic into software will  not make you a good trader. It will however prevent you from chasing  broken and cheap stocks, and more importantly it will save you from  yourself. This is probably the number 1 reason people continue to lose  money in the market (and holding losses), â*it canât go lower bro*â.

t3_gbh168,The Future of the S&P,"Throughout several platforms such as Bloomberg, Twitter, Reddit, I've noticed many people who agree with the idea that throughout this pandemic and shut downs, certain markets should be reacting in a way that they are not. 

At the beginning of the pandemic markets fell. The DOW and S&P completely sank taking out all gains from the past 3 years. Then came the quarantines, the city shut downs and unemployment claims skyrocketing. This would prompt an even further decline in the markets. 

Before we continue, let's talk about what should happen when the stock market falls and a recession is being talked about. When this happens people turn to safe heavens such as: US Dollar, cash, gold, CHF, and now...BitCoin. Where has the indicators for gold and BTC been after the pandemic? Down. From March 9th to March 20th gold fell -14.57%. BitCoin also saw a sell off and dropped -57.77%. As far as the US Dollar, when we look at the DXY chart we do see a spike in the USD that is now retracing after reaching the 103 levels. 

The recovery that S&P had during the month of April is illogical in my personal opinion given everything that is going on right now. *Millions more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, sending the six-week total above 30 million since the coronavirus pandemic began to shutter businesses across the country. (Bloomberg Businessweek).* Oil prices have tanked and there is a huge supply for very little demand. Small businesses are at risk of closing. Adding on to this the idea of trying to restart the economy by lifting all social distancing bans and opening cities back will only bring second waves of the pandemic, and more unemployment. The DOW and the S&P should not have made such moves in the past 6 weeks. 

Let's look at this from a technical analysis point of view. Below is a graph for S&P futures. If we use the fibonacci retracement tool, starting from the high to the lowest point we can see that the spike from the past 6 weeks has come into the 0.618 level. and respected it very well. Below is also an interesting article from Bloomberg that states that most investors are looking for another dip in the market before investing: ""*The majority of the worldâs wealthiest investors are waiting for stocks to drop further before buying again, on concerns about the pandemicâs impact on the global economy, according to a poll by UBS Global Wealth Management. Among the surveyed investors and business owners with at least $1 million in investable assets or in annual revenue, 61% want to see equities fall another 5% to 20% before buying, while 23% say itâs already a good time to do so. Some 16% say that now is not the time to load up on stocks as itâs a bear market.""*

With this information and the logic of how the world works combined with a little technical analysis I don't expect the S&P to come any higher than the 3000 level in the following weeks. Rather I believe that it will range between the 0.382 and 0.618 levels, leading up to the 2020 U.S. Elections in November. That is when we will see if the market will break high or break low and set the trend.

t3_gcr5hc,NQ/MNQ Daytrading,"I trade the NQ or the MNQ each day for income. It's important to make that distinction as some folks seem to daytrade using wealth building strategies and goals. That's unlikely to succeed long term, and leads to many blownup accounts.

I'm curious to see if there are others that are ONLY daytrading NQ, and if so is there a group or would you be interested in starting one? I'm profitable, funded by a prop firm, and a 'basehit vs homerun' kind of trader. Scalping based on price action, key levels, and the occasional runner to end the day early in the green. I don't like to trade all day, and in fact believe that the early action often contains the best trades of the day. Get one or two of those moves and be done. Green and gone as they say. 

If playing with 'curiosity trades' then go SIM or trade with a single micro for instance. I'm fine with exploring new ideas, but my bread and butter won't change unless something profoundly better with low risk is discovered. ""If it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it.""

I'm fine with a baseline of $200-$500 profit per day right now. Gusts higher sometimes as trailing a big move can give some big rewards, so if I'm in one, great, I'll stay in until I'm stopped out, hiding behind volume clusters and/or swing highs/lows. I honestly \*never\* know when I enter any trade what's going to happen, I take a setup and watch. Sometimes I'll get a few ticks, move to breakeven+3, and get stopped out a few times before I catch 'the one'. I'm totally ok with that.

t3_gdlz6i,Recovering Losses: Should I add more money?,"Due to a combination of no risk management, no position sizing judgment, I blew up one $15000 account and now Iâm 47% down on my 2nd account. 

Iâm starting to think I might not be very good at trading options.

Iâm down due to much of the same reasons I lost on the first: no stop losses, bag-holding and over-trading. 

Today I set my stop limits, sold in the green and didnât bag hold. Actually I was so averse to bagholding that I sold AMD options in the morning that ended up skyrocketing towards end of day, which was especially frustrating. 

However, the sins of the past week still haunted me, and I still ended up -$869 after cutting my losses, with another unrealized -$921 in tow.

I have $1500 left in buying power. 

I have added another $1000 but might not use it for fear of succumbing to what put me there in the first place. 

I can add a fair amount more to speed my recovery, but am hesitant. 

I intend to STRICTLY follow my stop-loss (30%) and will purchase only ONE position at a time and seek to never reach expiry. I intend to be cash at EOD as much as possible. I take profit at 10%+.

t3_gd1ufb,Measured Moves and the ES,"Hello everyone, I haven't seen anyone talk about measured moves in here before so I wanted to throw out what I know about them. 

I trade the ES solely, the ES is very efficient and the more efficient a market it is the more predictable it becomes. You can take this information and try to apply it to whatever market or stock you trade to see how the instrument reacts to these levels. 

Most price action moves in twos, over and over again. Move up, correction, another leg up; or inversely, move down, correction, another leg down. Measured moves work off this idea. After a move up and correction then there will be an equal sized move up from the low point of the correction. There is a bit of psycology behind it according to Al Brooks. He says once the market has moved significantly in one direction, and proves it will likely continue in that direction after correction traders will jump on with a 1:1 RR. He admits no one really knows why but that is his best guess and it's good enough for me. It's important to note that the market has to prove it's making a leg up or down, as that is part of the psychology behind it. Most of the time legs start at the high or low of the swings, but not always. 

I've taken some screen shots from this past week of the ES as to not seem like I'm cherry picking.

[April 27th](https://imgur.com/Fq15dia) the market made a large leg up in the overnight and started ranging. About 90% of the time ranges will continue moving in the direction the started, this being bullish in this case. Once we had a successful breakout it is likely to have a measured move that is as wide(tall) as the original range. [Even within the ranges](https://imgur.com/NLsbqv0) you'll get smaller [measured moves.](https://imgur.com/fS1FG2M)

1)You get a large move up with a correction and a strong bounce. You also get an ABCD(second entry) pattern right here. Corrective ABCD patterns tend to be the center of measured moves, short and long term. It also moves to test the bottom of the range after the MM.

2) You get a strong bounce off the bottom of the range with a correction. It pretty much plays out exactly as 1), almost reaching 100% pulling back and then continuing before a clean sell off.

3) When it didn't move to the bottom after the MM look at the entire move as a single leg up and look for a MM if the breakout succeeds. As you can see in the third chart it made it after a test of the breakout point. 

[April 28th](https://imgur.com/rjtBDcu) After a large move up you'd expect the range to breakout to the upside, but we did have a large move from the overnight on the 27th and the MM wasn't filled until the overnight of the 28th. [When it broke lower](https://imgur.com/ayiQyA9) you can see it 1)bounce at the 100% mark.

2) When it broke out and pulled back I used that as the starting point of my first leg and the correction(rough abcd) 3) as the pull back. Of course it kept going as it was likely to test the lows anyway, which it did and bounced.

4)Again, another leg up, correction, leg up. The MM missed the 100% mark by about 2 ticks, only to bounce again and fill it and continue a bit more. A lot of times when the MM isnt filled the market will bounce strongly, this is more evident for larger moves. The reversal seems to be proportional to the size of the leg.

[April 29th](https://imgur.com/h5dvDDc) 1)Another two legged MM in the overnight. After it bounce instead of reversing I'd look to see if those two legs up weren't a single leg in the bigger picture. 2) you can see it moving up to fill the MM but never quite gets there.

[April 30th](https://imgur.com/x4T4AFR) You can see the MM was never filled and reversed sharply as it seems to do when MM aren't met.

[May 1st](https://imgur.com/BAEH0z5) There was a down move in the overnight into a range, the expectation is that it continues moving down once there is a successful break of the range.

1) Even in a range, MM tend to work even if it means breaking out of SR for a bit. 

2) After a MM it will usually correct or reverse. Here you have the end of a MM into the start of the next. 4)You can see it again [here](https://imgur.com/H8a3AsT) before finally failing out the top for good

3) Once it fails out the top a few times it continues to move lower and fills a MM before bouncing.

5) 6) [Here](https://imgur.com/8elfjYK) are two more MM off the bottom of the extended range


A few more thoughts:

There was another trader here that posted about the market moving towards large resting orders and this may be a reason  why MM work.

Expect the market to at least correct after a MM if not a reversal, if it corrects and continues it will likely move much further than originally thought. BUT I have experience filled MM that correct only to move to a new extreme and THEN reverse so be careful trading just based on filled MM.

One issue with trading based solely on MM is that in order to place your stop in the safest place(beginning of the first leg) it will be a huge loss, so the next best place is below swings. Usually after a corrective ABCD pattern or double test. 

I've noticed that once the ES moves to about 75% there will be  pull back, sometimes significant and sometimes only a single bar. Sometimes the 75% will trigger a break of the short term trend, causing it to runup to the 100%/new extreme after some correction. Because of this and depending on where it is you entered, it might be better to try to get 75% of a move or at least  close most of your position at this level. Just an idea



Hope this can be useful for some of you. Trading is never 100% but the closer you can get to that number the better, cheers.",11,1.0,1588553510,"[['ES', 4], ['SR', 1], ['ABCD', 1]]",ES,79.37999725341797,77.81999969482422

t3_ge1a26,"Futures Trading: Looking for advice on platform, data provider and general."," ""Also posted on r/FuturesTrading""

Hey guys, I am highly considering changing to full-time day trading and with this to futures trading for many of the same reasons others do.

**Experience:**  With TradeStation on equities, I have been consistently profitable for 11 months and have my strategy laid out to where I am looking to go full time (stopping some  less-profitable, time consuming self-ran businesses), before I was  averaging about 2 hours a day; although now will be able to do upwards  of 8 hours as needed.

**My style:**  I am a day trader of equities currently, generally a very short term swing (think  capturing 1% changes on a 1min/5min chart, pivots from 30mins/Daily)  yet sometimes a scalp as price action dictates to me. My average time in  a trade sits around 3 minutes, almost no trades longer than 10 minutes.

**Education:** I have a *Bachelors in Statistic*s, currently studying *Data Science*  (mostly ML models, basics and those within stochastic style  environments as a tool for noise reduction and a novel weak-distribution  probability model that has been my long term project/paper) in the  financial world as a career (although would prefer to work for myself, I  have been solely an entrepreneur up to this point in my life to pay all  bills).

**What I have tried:**  I have demoed futures trading for 3 months in TD Ameritrade ToS,  NinjaTrader, TradeStation mostly. I have liked NinjaTrader best, but  still not convinced on it as a solution.

**What I want in a platform/data:**  low commissions as I tend to make a lot of trades, with /mes as an  example, would be 200-500 contracts a day, real-time level 2, some kind  of way to automatically track trade performance, ATM strategies like  NinjaTrader proved to be valuable to me,

**What can you recommend to me?**

I asked DAS and they talked about stale price quotes, probably an error of the exchange. Because my stop loss price was never within the spread I was not triggered.

They each have their own pros and cons, but for stocks it seems an argument could be made that StreetSmart Edge is the best of the three.  I don't trade options yet, but it looks like it is probably good for options as well.  Could be wrong.

As good as StreetSmart Edge seems to be, I'm just wondering is there something I'm missing that makes it or Schwab less popular for active traders?  At the same time I'm struggling to figure out why thinkorswim has the popularity that it does, unless most people also want to be able to trade futures with the same software.

1. No knowledge of TA. High expectations. Any profits can be attributed to beginner's luck.

2. Limited knowledge of TA. Trader may become elated at their new knowledge and the possibilities, but becomes fearful and upset when realizes he still can't turn a profit. 

3. Uses TA to pick his stocks, but his emotions get in the way of applying it correctly. They are stressed by mounting losses, but he may still be hopeful. 

4. Expert in TA but no risk management. Makes great paper profits but still no significant profits with real money. Has no rules, no plan, and no discipline. Most people quit at this point.

5. The trader is humbled by the market. Understands the importance of rules. Develops a plan with risk management, targets, and strategy. Cycles of euphoria, disappointment, and fear affect his bottom line. On average he breaks even.

6. Has found a profitable strategy but sometimes doesn't follow his rules. Gains are not consistent and leaves significant money on the table, but losses are minimal thanks to his risk management.  He begins to work on his psychology. 

7. Profits begin to see consistency. His emotional management is at the forefront of his trading objectives.

8. Trading strategy has been mastered and makes a good living out of trading. Euphoria and fear come up but he is able to control his emotions before they start to affect his bottom line. He is able to think in probabilities, accepts whatever the market wants to offer him without getting emotional. 

9. Has the instincts of a trader and can have winning streaks spanning for weeks. Makes more sophisticated trades. Looks for opportunities in other markets.

10. Picks the most profitable stocks of the day for consistent periods, and buys / sells at the top/ bottom of the day. Being a 10 has an element of luck so it is temporary.",164,0.9500000000000001,1589123022,"[['TA', 2]]",TA,8.899999618530273,10.350000381469727

t3_gir2c1,Tuesday Daily Market Report,"A nice overnight rally brought a gap up at the open, and more than 1000 net advances. But it was met by very little enthusiasm after the opening bell, and prices decayed downward.Then a more urgent selling wave unfolded in the final hour of the day, resulting in 2% declines for the major averages, and more than that for the Russell 2000. The breadth turnaround also meant that the NYSEâs McClellan A-D Oscillator dropped down below zero. It did that just a few days ago, but now the context of this drop below zero is different. That dip to a -10 reading on May 6 came in the wake of a complex structure above zero.That complex structure said that the bulls wereâin chargeâ, even if the bears might mount a charge. But then the rebound to back up above zero resulted in just a simple structure above zero.That simple structure says that the bulls have given up the presumption of control that the former complex structures had given them.Whether the bears can seize control is a separate question, but the opportunity has been handed tothem. The VIX Index jumped higher by 19.8% on Tues-day. One day VIX up moves of greater than 10%have historically been pretty good markers for short term bottoms, but this year that principle has not worked all that well.We are in an era when theâvolatility of volatilityâ is in another realm of behavior.The top chart on page2 shows the CBOE EquityPut/Call Volume Ratio.On Friday and Monday, it had gotten down to the lowest readings since the Covid-19 selloff began. Tuesdayâs reading was up slightly from those low readings, but not by enough to suggest that the 2%selloff has done all that it needs to do in order to signal a short term sentiment washout. The more likely outcome is that we have another week or so of malaise and discouragement, as the great âreopeningâdoes not materialize as fast as we all would like, and as the Fedâs QE and other efforts are seen as losing traction. Look for alot of discussion about how the V bottom is going to turn into a W, and rumblings about how we are for sure going to have to go back and retest the March 23 low. When that viewpoint approaches universality, then the work of the pause shown in the Presidential Cycle Pattern will have been completed, and the market should be able to resume its advance.

However, I've read multiple times that thinkorswim order execution leaves something to be desired; whether it be the lack of direct-market access (DMA) not filling orders, or not filling orders timely enough. I've heard quite a bit about traders using TradeStation, DAS, Lightspeed, and NinjaTrader for better order execution, and just using TOS for charts.

I downloaded TradeStation and checked it out (since it's the only commission-free broker with DMA) but coming from TOS, the UI just feels so outdated and lacking, it was driving me nuts. I wouldn't mind using a commission broker if others recommend it and the profit loss from commissions is negligible in the grand scheme of things. I've heard some good things about NinjaTrader and was thinking about trying them instead.

However, as a beginner, would you recommend that I use two separate platforms? If so, those of you who use NinjaTrader, what do you think of it? Or should I just trade/view charts on TOS for now to lessen the learning curve?

I just don't want to keep learning a new platform. I know they all have advantages/disadvantages, but I'd rather get used to one or two now and stick with them and focus on actually trading.

### CV Sciences, Inc. Receives Formal Notice of Patent Issuance from USPTO for Proprietary Cannabidiol (CBD) and Nicotine Formulation for Treating Smokeless Tobacco Addiction

SAN DIEGO, May 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [CV Sciences, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SqFdNqCDJds4RU_Rry1JlBo2vdabGC9O20r6d75bx97EihwmB0kWDIC1zR4B81F1qrnKbHlAqD4Khb2hqapTaA==) (OTCQB:CVSI) (the âCompanyâ, âCV Sciencesâ, âourâ, âusâ or âweâ), a preeminent supplier and manufacturer of hemp cannabidiol (CBD) products, today announced that on May 19, 2020, the Company received its formal Notice of Issuance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for its patent application 15/426,617.  


The patent covers methods of treating smokeless tobacco addiction by administering pharmaceutical formulations containing CBD and nicotine. The communications between the USPTO and the Company conclude substantive examination of the patent application, resulting in formal issuance of the patent.Â  CV Sciences has also filed corresponding patent applications that will allow the Company to seek similar patent protection in other key markets throughout the world.

The worldwide smokeless tobacco addiction treatment market is estimated at greater than $2 billion and provides another important long-term growth channel for CV Sciences, in addition to the Companyâs consumer product segment.

âUSPTOâs patent issuance demonstrates that our proprietary technology, the first-of-its-kind treatment for smokeless tobacco addiction, is based on unique science backed by years of research and development,â said Joseph Dowling, Chief Executive Officer, CV Sciences.Â  âThis intellectual property positions CV Sciences to derive significant value from our development efforts with an important therapeutic drug that has the potential to transform healthcare given the public health, societal and economic damage caused by nicotine addiction.Â  With this patent, our years of investment, research and hard work is now validated, and we are well positioned and proud to take the next steps towards bringing to market an innovative solution to address a huge unmet medical need and global health issue.â

Dowling continued, âThe validation of patent protection provides CV Sciences with significant flexibility in moving this drug program forward, including potential co-development with a strategic and/or financial partner, as well as drawing on existing company resources to finance our drug development activities.â

In light of this patent issuance, the Company has decided to form a new wholly-owned C-Corporation to which it will transfer the assets and operations of its drug development program, providing the Company with greater flexibility to fund and/or partner its drug development efforts and to separate a distinct operating segment from its consumer products operations.

The Companyâs initial drug candidate (CVSI-007) contains nicotine and CBD to support cessation of smokeless tobacco use and addiction.Â  With USPTOâs formal issuance of the patent, CV Sciences will continue development efforts as the Company seeks approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to commercialize the worldâs first and only FDA-approved treatment for smokeless tobacco addiction.

I read some article from a skeptical academic who interviewed successful traders for a book about technical analysis. the main take away was that they said if there was any use to this stuff it is only in refining your timing strategy for entering and exiting positions, but not about what to buy. 

So I only use it to reinforce or rethink ideas I already have. But even then I think it may be backfiring more than it helps or helping so little itâs a waste of time. 

People want the validation of feeling like a diviner who knows how to read the tea leaves right and any failures are just cause they arenât doing it right, but what if this isnât the mystical rocket surgery people have to pretend it is to justify continuing the pursuit in the face of evidence otherwise?

You know that sick feeling of buying at the peak and selling at the bottom? Maybe itâs just involvement bias?

Some Days I make a bunch of plans about what movements I expect to see and what Iâll do as a result. But then something comes up so I just donât touch anything. then later I look at how much I got right, but then following these clear patterns i can see where I would have taken the prescribed action and more than likely I wouldâve gotten punished.

Might just be all luck (small sample) but the stocks I pick generally outperform, and acting on technical analysis has me lowering/raising my exposure at the worst times.

I think these patterns are so simple, well known and appealing (we want to believe itâs this easy), they are more likely useful as contrarian indicators. 

Maybe the market is roughly efficient until randomly an old famous technical pattern forms, then TA speculators push the price away from equilibrium.

Anyone ever try contrarian technical analysis?

Ps. Iâm generally inspired by contrarian style investing. So contrarian picks with contrarian timing seems like a natural evolution for me.",5,1.0,1590030755,"[['TA', 1]]",TA,10.239999771118164,14.539999961853027

They are notorious for bad fills in the early minutes of market open.  Even during paper trading, if I wanted to make a trade within the opening minute, it may not get filled for 30 seconds to a few minutes, when I very likely would have wanted to be out of the trade.  I do not like trading the opening bell, but if the opportunity is there, I would like to be able to take it.


So I am about to start going live.  At first, I want to focus on a free broker before I go to something like Lightspeed.  A big reason for this is I want to start with a small share size to see how I handle the emotions of using real money and scale up from there.  And using the share size I plan on, the commissions and platform fees can get me.

While I paper trade on TD Ameritrade, I haven't particularly liked the platform.  When I want to go back and study charts, I have used Webull.  I actually like the charts much better, they do everything I want.  How are the fills on Webull?  Is there another broker that would be good with this?  I know eTrade, Schwab, and many others have all relatively recently gone to commission free trading.  I have searched for this plenty of times and the results are typically too old to be relevant.


I am not against paying small fees like $25 for Level 2 on Webull, or if platform fees are waived with a certain dollar amount like Tradestation.

My TFSA (IRA equivalent) and RRSP (401k equivalent) are maxed out and this is where my Index funds sit.

That said, my emergency fund sitting in my HISA has ballooned far beyond 12 months expenses, and I want to open a brokerage account at my bank to start trading/speculating with this extra money. This would represent about 10% of my total portfolio, so even if I get wiped out I will be okay financially.

I have done some trading in the past with weedstocks, and was successful, but it's worth noting I have no Level 2 Data, no Real Time trading, and not much experience. Usually I would just jump in on a stock when there's a news release or hype of some sort, ride the wave, and sell for a couple hundred bucks profit.

t3_gvagki,"Trading Strategy, Progression, and Insights From P&L","Hi all, I wanted to share a bit about my trading strategy -- I think I'm likely quite a bit more developed than some but definitely have a long long way to go in my journey. My hope is that this post will help others progress faster. I'm also very open to suggestions/constructive criticism as I am very much still refining my process and actively trying to learn. The post isn't going to talk so much about specific setup or patters, but more about process and the mental aspects of trading. A lot of what I'm going to talk about will reference my trade log which is linked below. I was going to post a direct link the the google sheet but I'm worried about anonymity so for now I'm just posting a screenshot. Happy to try to post the actual doc if anybody has good suggestions for how to do that.

P&L spreadsheet attached, feel free to copy it if it helps you (theres a fair bit of automated logics that I like). Feel free to make suggestions if you have them. Current personal focus points are trade management, not fighting trend, and not putting a premium on my 1 trade/day.

I have been investing in US equities for around 10 years now and started to get really interested in trading at the beginning of last year. I happened to find the podcast Chat with Traders and have now listened to almost every episode and it made a very big impact on me. While everybody has a different story, the main thing that I took away from all those interviews is that if you want to actually succeed as a trader (not just get lucky on penny stocks a few times), process and mental disposition are far more important than short term profits or other table-stakes pre-req knowledge points like recognizing a bull flag or overbought RSI. As such, I have literally spend the past year or two watching markets very closely with a critical and curious eye, strategizing and theorizing, but ultimately not placing too many trades (although hundreds of mental ones). Like a lot of people, now that I'm sitting at home with 2 monitors, nobody looking over my shoulder, no wasted commute time in the day, etc, this might be one of my best opportunities I will ever have to try to test the waters. As you can see, I started trading with a very small account and I am still trading with a very small account. My goal has never really been to make money, but rather to learn, test strategies, and get a feel for things. Obviously I hope to be profitable someday, but currently I'm just trying to prove out a strategy.

When I first started scheming up strategies, **swing trading US equities felt the most viable** for a variety of reasons; it took less daily attention, it wouldn't have high commission overhead (obviously not relevant anymore), and it didn't require extremely quick execution which then requires more advanced infrastructure (data, brokers, keyboards, monitors, level 2/DOM, etc). I was basically using RSI, MACD, and moving averages to scout for extremely oversold conditions on daily charts where I could risk no more than 3% of position with target of 5-15%. As you can see from my P&L, this **wasn't a very effective strategy for several reasons**:

* Unless I got perfect execution on the entry (which would basically require some serious bottom fishing expeditions), a 3% stop was too tight for these sorts of longer reversal plays. There were a lot of times when ultimately the setup was good, but I was getting stopped out by volatility that was still well within the thesis of the trade, and then a few days later it would break out just like I had predicted. Had I put a 5% stop then I would have been up 15-20% on some of them. The issue here is that if I have several missed trades on a small account, then I have basically blown up my account and my main goal was to avoid that.
* As you can see, I then experimented with mental stops. That was fucked. My two largest losses (percent wise) are by far from terrible trade management while I didn't have hard stops in place. See line 5, 8, 10 in p&l (also a 30% loss on Exon not even listed).
* On these sorts of longer position/swing trades, you really need to scale in and out in order to effectively manage your risk. ie. start with a very small position and go from there -- if it breaks down then maybe you average down or maybe you sell for a small loss but at least you have options and its not so ""all or nothing"". Because of commissions and my small account size, this wasn't really a viable option.
* Gap/news risk. Longer held positions are obviously more exposed to the market conditions shifting and effecting the thesis of the trade. This takes active attention to manage/mitigate that risk.

Fast forward to the end of 2019 and you can see that my hold time starts to get a lot shorter (with the exception of that one bag holder trade on MJ). I finally came to the realization that scouting trades on trading view and then trying to execute on Fidelity was just a complete joke and I needed to get my infrastructure sorted out. Now I use \*a better broker\*(Mods) and its great. Being able to watch the order flow has wonders for position management and placing orders at more precise levels relative to the market.

So now, I'm basically trying to implement similar strategies (reversals) but on way shorter time frames. My ideal setup is oversold/bought on all timeframes from 3m through 4hr. Here is a pic of a setup that came along the other day that I consider to be A+. I'll talk more about this later as I somewhat botched this trade and there are some good learning points I took from it. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/66AObCxq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/66AObCxq/)

The **nuts and bolts of my strategy** are as follows:

* Risk no more than 1% of account on any trade. As of now I'm considering a ""full position"" to be my whole account. Generally, I'm trying to scale up risk when I'm confident and decrease risk when I'm not. If I find a setup that I like but it requires a 2% stop placement, then I put on a 1/2 sized position so I still only risk 1% of account.
* I'm not fucking around without stops EVER. I'm effectively using conditional orders so stops are automatically placed. Its great and helps me be more objective about each trade and helps me execute more quickly.
* Patience is the ABSOLUTE most important thing when trading. You have to wait for the right setups and you have to wait for the perfect moment to strike to tilt risk/reward in your favor when those setups come along. IMO as a chump like myself, I don't have a fighting chance on reversals unless I'm the most patient bid on the chart.
* If I see something that I REALLY like I will lever up for it. Never a ton but a little. I think this is an important step in gettin comfortable with taking on more size in the future. Don't force it, but be ready to throw down when the obvious time presents itself. Don't hesitate, just trust yourself and do it.
* Don't let a winning trade turn into a losing trade. This means taking size off and bringing up stops as soon as it starts working in my favor

Generally, I feel like my execution and management has gotten decently consistent and its actually my setup selection thats starting to hold me back. This is what I'm starting to put a bit more time/work into.

Now I want to dive into a specific trade I made recently (referenced above) that I think has a lot of learning value...at least it did for me. Here is the chart. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/66AObCxq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/66AObCxq/)

The context here is important. This is a stock that was hyped pre-corona, took a huge dip, but then ripped face to new highs. To me it was clear that this would have huge buy pressure if/when it dipped. I woke up one day last week and it was oversold on every timeframe up to 4hr. This, in conjunction of the fact that it was clearly wicking back to a strong level of support and rounding out, is what immediatly signaled to me that this was a trade to hit big. I actually botched the entry a little as I was trying to play around with marketing in on momentum rather than setting a limit like I normally and waiting for it. In retrospect I should have just immediatly marketed in when I saw the chart as I would have been in around .5% lower. After the trade I was reviewing the entry and realized that it made a really nice higher low on the 1m chart which would have been the perfect point of entry to confirm the trend change and maximize risk/reward. Normally I wouldn't look to the 1m for that sort of confirmation but I knew that it was so oversold that any trend change would have serious followthrough. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/HyoibQiP/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HyoibQiP/)

Once I was filled it pulled back for a moment and then started to rip. As part of not letting winners be losers, I took some size off once it was up \~2% and then a bit more around +2.3% and as it was approaching VWAP. I already consider those to be winning trades and if it suddenly turned and tanked through my stop then I would probably still break even. I stand by those sells and think those were smart, especially considering that it was moving straight towards obvious resistance (VWAP).

But then I fuck up by selling after it breaks VWAP. At the time I was just stoked because I was up 2 or 3% on a trade and in auto-pilot ""take off risk"", mode but in retrospect it was so clearly holding strong support at VWAP and clearly the worst time to sell. From there it continues up a few % at which point its basically just ran %4 straight up to resistance with no pullback. It seemed like it obviously had to pull back here to gather seam but I didn't really want to sit through that so I kept selling. And it blew straight through resistance that I had pre-conceived assumptions about. Ultimately this was a winning trade and I made a decent bit (relative to account value) and I'm happy. Having said that, it could have been way better and I did a terrible job of reading the situation as it was playing out. Having a better entry also would have been nice but I'm less worried about that as its more clear to me how to clean up that error. Had I simply not sold any of my position I would have made around 8% on this trade rather than 2.8. That is frustrating as fuck knowing how important it is to smash out of the park when the opportunity presents. On the flip side, I live to trade another day and I've learned things, so it's still a W.

Here are my **current focus points** and things that I am trying to actively keep in mind to progress my trading. I just discussed the first one and I am happy to discuss the other two if anybody is interested.

* Read the situation to let winners run and cut losers. (ENPH example)
* Scout reversals on 3/5 min timeframe and ride the trend on 5/15 min timeframe. Reversals on 15 min require A+ setup so I don't get ran over by the trend. Longer timeframes mean stronger trends at play -- you have to be extremely patient. If you get past PDT issues, then you can obviously afford to stop out a few times and then hit it on the 3rd try, but if you are under 25k account, you need to be perfect which is VERY hard. Reversals on shorter timeframes wont carry so much trend/momentum and wont run quit as long.
* Trade every trade perfectly but also don't give a shit about any trade. Psychology of only having 1 trade a day. I wrote most of this post last week but actually ran into this today (Monday). I passed up on several ""boring"" but good setups because I was waiting on a bigger play to develop. I ended up losing on that bigger play and now regret not taking the smaller setups. If I had more trades to make then I would have taken them all but the fact that I have to pick which trade to make, effects my judgement/execution. I don't know if theres anything to do about this other than be aware of it or allow myself to trade with a real account.

In conclusion, I'm very happy with where I am at, and confident that I'm on a good track if I can make a few tweaks. If my next 10-20 trades have a higher win rate I will probably double my account. But again, my goal at that point wouldn't really be to ""make money"". I also plan to fund my TOS account to help eliminate some of the psychological effects of only having 1 trade a day. IMO if you want to succeed at trading it requires a genuine curiosity of the markets -- you cant just be in it to make money. As I said, very open to suggestions or criticisms.

The idea here is to limit the amount of searching for this information on the internet and consolidate these searches into a single place for trading clubs to share among their members.

Commands are formatted as: !<command> <ticker or comma-separated list of tickers>  
**!eh** displays a grid of historical earnings data  
**!ew** displays next earnings report day with EPS and revenue estimates  
**!ec** displays the next earnings call with call-in or webcast links  
**!f** displays market cap, ATR, shares floating and short interest, average daily volume, beta, and 52-week range  
**!rv** displays current intraday volume from 8am onward  
**!ml** displays S&P market down limits for today  
**!im** displays implied moves and short float

A few examples:  
**!im zm,apps**  
Ticker: ZM  
Implied Move Weekly: 14.55%  
Short Float: 9.47%  
\------------------------------------------------------------  
Ticker: APPS  
Implied Move Monthly: 23.72%  
Short Float: 5.75%

**!ew tdoc**

t3_gxfwpl,GNUS is gonna blow! Read this thing.,"Genius Brands Chair, CEO Sends Letter To Shareholders

Dear Friends and Shareholders: In these unprecedented times where we are all looking for healing and positivity, there is nothing more important than a smile, and that smile is the core of our product at Genius

BenzingaÂ Â·Â 6/5/2020, 9:20:51 AM

Dear Friends and Shareholders:
In these unprecedented times where we are all looking for healing and positivity, there is nothing more important than aÂ smile, and that smile is the core of our product at Genius Brands.Â  We make animated cartoons for children, and families. We tell stories, which make children feel good, make them laugh, and bring them joy.Â  We seek to enrich with positive lessons, tolerance, and inclusion, and that has never been more important than today.
To that end, I am proud to share that this morning we announced the engagement of the most successful programming executive in the history of childrenâs television,Â Margaret Loesch, as Executive Chairman ofÂ Kartoon Channel!
Loesch was the founding president and CEO of Fox Kids Networks Worldwide, growing the channels across all metrics, where it was eventually sold to the Walt Disney Company for $5.5 billion.
Joining Margaret will be the former President of Walt Disney Television,Â David Neuman, who will becomeÂ Kartoon Channel!, Chief Content Officer.
David, among other things, oversaw theÂ Wonderful World of DisneyÂ and the then #1 sitcom on television, Home Improvement, and earned over 100 Emmys on his watch, while there and previously as Head of Comedy Development at NBC.
It would be impossible for me to adequately sing their praises and the impact these two extraordinarily talented and accomplished people can bring to bear uponÂ Kartoon Channel!, our new kids program service.
Margaret has been a value creator of epic proportions throughout her career, and she brings a gift for picking and developing hit programs and creating hit schedules.Â  She ran NBC Saturday morning, before leaving for Hanna-Barbera Productions, where she was head of development and production where she oversaw the massive hit, Smurfs, among their other many productions. From there, she went to become President ofÂ Marvel Entertainment, where she produced hit after hit, and subsequent to that, went toÂ FOXÂ as founder and CEO ofÂ FOX Kids, after which she became President ofÂ Jim Henson Television. The brands she has produced and broadcast are legendary.Â Power Rangers, Batman, Spider-Man, Steven Spielbergâs Animaniacs, Transformers, My Little Pony, X-Men, Muppet Babies, andÂ Fraggle RockÂ are among the many.
The value of each company and network, she was at was enriched dramatically by her presence.Â  She is on the Board of Governors of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and is a rare âtriple threatâ, who knows theÂ BroadcastÂ Business, theÂ ProductionÂ Business, and theÂ AdvertisingÂ Business.
As I said this in announcing them, this is like having Michael Jordan and LeBron James on the same team.Â  Alongside Margaret and David is our ultra-talented General Manager,Â Caroline Tyre, who, âby the wayâ, ran the top childrenâs broadcast service in Canada,Â Teletoon, and helped launchÂ Cartoon Network,Â Boomerang, andÂ Adult SwimÂ in Canada.
As we run up to the launch ofÂ Kartoon Channel!Â on June 15, we are all excited about the unprecedented carriage and launch footprint, which covers more than 100 million U.S. TV households and 200 million mobile devices, across cable, satellite, digital, and OTT platforms, including Comcast, COX, Dish, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Amazon Fire, Roku, and Tubi, among them.
We previously describedÂ Kartoon Channel!Â  like âa Netflix for kids, but its free.âÂ  Our model is what is called in the industry, AVOD (Advertiser Video On Demand). There is an important significance to this, which in todayâs childrenâs broadcast world, brings powerful âwind to our sailsâ.

Netflix and Disney +, viewership is dramatically up, because people are staying at home more.Â  For a combination of COVID-19 and social reasons, this is even more so for childrenâs TV (e.g. most schools closed, many summer camps have been canceled).
Â 

Childrenâs Advertiser Demand is UP, while Available Inventory is Scarce.Â  Inventory isÂ scarce, because more and more kids have migrated fromÂ linear channels to On Demand channelsÂ and much of that On Demand viewing is on Netflix and on Disney+Â where there is no advertising.Â  The result is that advertisers need to scramble to find commercial inventory and âeyeballsâ through which to promote their products, and brands.

Kartoon Channel!Â will launch with a number of âprogramming eventsâ, which we believe will be extremely compelling for kids, and which we will announce for you the week before launch.
Having said the above, we want our shareholders to measure expectations.Â  We will start providing projections beginning Q4, at which point we will have visibility on viewing patterns and advertising.Â  (In the kidâs media business, the âhard 8â, those weeks leading up to Christmas is where 50% of the yearâs advertising revenue is typically generated.)
While turning the channel on is not a âlight switch,â in Margaret and David, we have two of the smartest most proven programmers in the business, and we are going to succeed and take share from a multi-billion-dollar kidâs advertising pie.
We are committed to ensure that the team of Margaret, David, and General Manager, Caroline Tyre, have the resources they need to acquire the most competitive childrenâs product, and the marketing to drive the channel forward.
Margaret, David, and Caroline will have multiple tools in their toolbox to succeed, not least of which will be the pristine balance sheet of Genius Brands, modest debt, and the substantial cash in its war chest to drive the channel forward. In addition, they will have Genius Brands own carefully curated properties from top creators and producers including:
Stan Leeâs Cosmic Crusaders
Warren Buffettâs Secret Millionaires Club
Martha & Friends
Because we carefully curate our owned entertainment that we produce for the channel to be not only positive and enriching for children, but equally, to lend itself to licensed consumer products,Â Kartoon Channel!Â will complete a âVirtuous Circle""* for Genius Brands and drive a second income stream.
The shows we produce go on the channel, and they get aggressively promoted to create viewership and launch positive consumer products, from which we earn to invest in more content.
We are committed to not just entertain, but also to enrich, and as a parent of a 12-year-old myself, I can assure you that is, and will always be, front and center, as we work to create growing value and pride for our shareholders.
Welcome to Margaret Loesch and David Neuman!
Our business is smiles.
Sincerely,
Andy Heyward
Chairman & CEO
Genius Brands International, Inc.

t3_gxlthr,"[$BA][6/6/20] ""As Boeing($BA) lays off workers and resumes 737 MAX production, they are positioned to become even more efficient and profitable than ever before.""","Last week Boeing announced they were going to be laying off 6,770 employees as part of the first wave of involuntary layoffs. This reduction in staff may seem to be a significant negative for Boeing and indeed, is a large negative for the short-term investor. However, in the long-term, this layoff (in combination with voluntary layoffs last month) will allow Boeing to emerge from this downturn as a more efficient company as the company focuses on profits during this difficult time.

Also, last week, we learned that Boeing had reached a significant milestone regarding the over a yearlong 737 MAX grounding as they resumed aircraft production. Boeing has begun production of this aircraft, albeit at a shallow rate, focusing on methodologies to enhance quality and plans to ramp production this year. As the 737 MAX is a significant source of revenue and profit for Boeing, the resumption of production is a sign that recertification is on the horizon.

Over the last two days, the stock has seen substantial gains driven by news that airlines are finally on the upswing as more people are flying in comparison to the lows reached last month. However, even in light of substantial gains, the stock remains 40% off pre-corona highs, and over 50% from all-time highs reached in mid-2019. With Boeing gaining $25 billion from one of the most extensive debt offerings in history, they will have access to plenty of funds to withstand this downturn with no government aid.

As production of the 737 MAX continues, and Boeing becomes more efficient from an employment perspective, Boeing is positioned to become even more valuable than before this pandemic. Global air travel has increased dramatically over the last 15 years with no end in sight. As the only US producer of commercial aircraft and a principal US defense contractor, the US government will ensure Boeing's long-term success over the next ten years.",4,0.8300000000000001,1591424814,"[['MAX', 4]]",MAX,21.6200008392334,32.93000030517578
t3_gxlek2,A traders reflections and my biggest lesson,"I started investing in 2007 while in high school with money I saved from splitting wood. I started with buy and hold then started to learn more about derivatives. Iâm 29 now have been doing this for 13+ years and have thought a lot about my growth as Iâve been trying to help others along their paths. I started a YouTube channel on 4 May - I wanted to pay forward the most important lesson Iâve learned in my investing career, mentorship. I donât sell anything, I have no affiliates. I started the channel to pay homage to those who offered me their time generously. 

Like most, I made a lot of stupid mistakes when first starting. I didnât have a plan and didnât know what I didnât know. I ended up joining a bunch of FB groups and most were horrible. Half cocked answers, sarcastic assholes making fun of me because I didnât know, and half the people trying to sell shit - it sucked. Then in one group I found a guy that was a Army veteran and a doctor. I was in ROTC on my way into the Marines. 

That man changed my life. He never directly offered to mentor me. But after observing him for a while - I realized he truly knew what he was doing and was willing to help those who wanted to help themselves. Iâve spent over a decade talking strategy, receiving constant critique, and earnest feedback. His tutelage was irreplaceable in transforming my approach from random trades with no real strategy - to a methodical business approach. I continue to seek his input to this day.

t3_gz74t4,Graph Types and help with automatic trend markers...Trading 212.,"So first of all...do any of you day traders or scalpers use the standard candlesticks rather than Heikin Ashi? 

I'm finding the smoothing out of the HA graph makes it a lot quicker to draw in my trend lines and higher and lower limits as I go, and it doesn't seem to make much difference with 1 minute candles. I need to make my lines really pop as I dont have enough desktop space with my second monitor being a poor old 1080 TV.

Secondly, being new to the platforms and using them actively in a day trading scenario like this, what indicators are useful to use?

I have started to use both an awesome oscillator and then I draw my own trend lines over the candles from close to close to set my higher and lower limits and judge when to move my stop up or to sell. I have played around with the software and to be honest nothing works as good as me just doing it myself. Am I missing something? I would be able to more successfully run more trades at once if my OCD level trend lines could be drawn in automatically. The AO helps but like/prefer thick bright lines so I can keep the graphs minimised while doing other things and they still pop and catch my attention when a downturn is reaching my lower limit. 

Also as a PS, thanks to all of you guys posting advice and your watch lists. Not only have you and the links you've posted helped me develop my trade plan, you helped me go from a loss today to 10% profit for the day.

I also share a new ETF I came across that offers exposure to the growing world of online betting. Summary below for those that prefer that, video link at the bottom for those that prefer that:

I'm in heavy cash because I definitely see tremendous downside potential. Between the rally we've see while still being in a pandemic, the fed's intervention that will eventually have to cease, and my perception that we likely will see another serious wave of COVID as things open back up. I'm absolutely okay maintaining small exposure here.

VRM - IPO. I typically like to watch IPOs, they're interesting events to me and typically offer a volatile trade for those interested. I am not necessarily passionate about online car sales however, so I personally will be waiting until options are available to trade this one.

AAL DAL. AAL made a 70% run up, DAL a 35% run up. These are both short candidates for me due to the price extremes in conjunction with the fact we are still quite a ways from completely opening up.

BETZ. This was a neat ETF I found that offers exposure to online betting. Overall, a market I imagine will continue to expand so I'm hopeful that this will have options on it soon.

For the haters that there's a video - I still don't sell anything and have no affiliates. If you don't want to see the video, don't go to it. I've been having awesome interactions with people on the channel so I absolutely will continue to do what's more helpful for our community regardless negativity. I prefer to help each other out, not tear one another down.

Trade on!

Yesterday the NASDAQ closed at a record high. The S&P 500 is now positive on the year. We are officially in a recession now too.

Every moment in the market is unique. Past patterns can give us clues to what might be next but no guarantees. Gains of 1% or more per day is not typical of bull markets.

The **VIX** has remained high despite recent gains. Yesterday it was up 5% and did not drop much as the markets surged higher. A higher VIX usually favors the bears. Futures are pointing to a lower open.

t3_h7zmwj,Thoughts from a novice: How I made $$ and didn't get burned in the Chinese stock run-ups this week...,"Just a few thoughts from a novice, Iâve been trading on and off for about a year.  Iâm posting this primarily to encourage those newer to daytrading.  

This week there were several stocks (mostly Chinese) that were up between 300-1200% in one day.  We haven't seen these kinds of patterns regularly for some time.  These stocks are extremely risky and entering in them needs to be done with great care.  However, the opportunity for a solid return is excellent.  Whether this will continue into the coming weeks is unknown, but some principles Iâm using I believe still apply to general breakout stocks.

For example, this week I started with less than $25k in an account and I managed to make about $7k over the past four days.  (I had more in my account before but just bought a truck.  I'm a fairly new trader and did work with more value in my account in the past...)

So this week I made $7k, and some friends of mine have much more (like 10x).  So itâs not a lot of money to be honest.  But I wanted to say, in the past,  I have always seemed to go in the other direction.

This week I did about 8 trades and all were positive.  That's only because I have day traded for about 12 months on and off and lost thousands in the past and learned to make less mistakes.  I am now getting close to getting back to even.

Some people dont understand that when you start day trading you will lose money.  95%+ do.  It takes a few (or several) hits before you learn some skills.  And much of it is feel.  

For example $CTIB today ran up huge premarket, most expected it to go like $IMRN and $JFIN and $WAFU among others did this week.  It dropped about an hour after opening and everyone expected it to return.  It never did.  From 12 premarket to 2.50 at the end of day.    Same story with the other chinese market movers, but just a bit later in the day.

This has been the story of these stocks this week.  Of course shorting them is great, but the shares are not always available, and you have to have the courage to stand by, knowing that 300% could rise to 600%, but in the case of these Chinese stocks, they'll likely come down.

Anyways, some thoughts from a novice trader with respect to day trading and momentum:

1. Risk management is absolutely key.  I look for gains in the range of $500-1000 considering my small account size and size appropriately.  I know doubling down is not always good, but in these momentum plays, I leave some margin for that purpose, and it usually pays off in case I am down a bit.
2. Premarket is risky.  You have to know what you are doing.  More often than not drops will come before market opens.  See whats happening between 8:15 and 9:15 EST.  Investing at 7am ""just because its in play"" is not usually the best approach.  Webull and 4am trading may work for some, but the volume paints a sketchy picture.  4 to 7am is an art I have not figured out yet.
3. Don't get greedy.  Today I bought $CTIB at 6.75 and sold at $8.  Not a big deal but once it hit 8 it never returned to those levels.  It dropped to 6 then to 4 then to 2.5.  I could have been greedy and waited for $10, which it hit before, but I know that a gain of about 20% was sufficient.  
4. Timing is everything.  For the vast majority of stocks running up premarket, everything happens between 9:30 and 11am.  Usually earlier.
5. Don't hold overnight.  With rare exceptions, I never hold overnight.  If the stock is a late runner in the day it may be OK, or if after hours has action.  But usually by the afternoon the general direction is set and you will get burned if you are down (generalization of course).
6. Shorting is fine, but pay a lot of attention to the fees.  They can make it less compelling.  But there are a ton of shorting opps right now.
7. Offerings suck and can happen at any time, especially around big runs.  Pay close attention!
8. There is a reason they call them pump and dump.   There is a lot of manipulation with lower floats.  Get on the back of those moving the market, dont play against them. 
9. Post-market offers great opps as well, just be sure not to get caught too much in momentum.  You can overpay for what it may sell for at 9am the next day.
10. Donât put in day trading what you canât afford to lose.  Tight budgets require conservative approaches to trading. 
11. Have fun, love your spouse or partner (if you have one), and don't let trading affect your emotional health.  Personally, I pray for wisdom as well.",21,0.92,1592018803,"[['CTIB', 2], ['IMRN', 1], ['JFIN', 1], ['WAFU', 1]]",CTIB,2.799999952316284,2.569999933242798
t3_h9lfqc,"My opinion on ""How to Day Trade for a Living"" by Andrew Aziz...","Before I go further you should know I have lurked in demo accounts a couple years ago but due to studies and age I was not able to dive in with trading. I did not read a single book in my time until I becided I would try learn day trading. I am also not a good writer so sorry for the un-organised and maybe not the fluent opinion you were looking for. 

For myself, learning from a book has made my understanding progress and help me watch live trading and trying to understand whats actually going on. Prior reading to this book i was learning through Reddit, chart patterns on google images..what a joke i know and i also heavily used you tube. Back a couple of years ago i rinsed investigator which i recommend.  This style of learning made me familiar with terms but there was holes in my learning making it difficult to understand someone else's ideas and trades. 

The book starts off very bland and basic which goes on for about 12 pages explaining being a successful trader does not happen overnight and what i brought from this was you have to lose to win which . He talks about different styles of trading such as swing vs day which helped made me realise that my day trading was partially mixed with swings. He touches on retail and institutional traders which i didn't think of prior to this book. Explains his ""stocks in play"" which developed my understanding of hey i have got somewhere and ideas of what to look out for, this led me to downloading a scanner on my computer which thank fuck i did because i found myself at stocks which users talked about in this community and actually had stocks on my watch list before someone posted them on Rebdit. 

Throughout the book he will explain his scanner and really that opens your idea on things you should play with and actually understand what your tweaking. Hits on risk management and that really your Risk/Reward should be determined for reasons other than its the one which you heard most day traders use. Talks about the importance of a catalyse and where you can go to find them and what you could look out for. 

This books hits lightly on trading psychology throughout the book so myself im still left in limbo in the  understanding the ""importance"" which people stress about often in you tube.

He likes to focus on indecision canbles and to be quit honest when i review a trade hes right there a good reversal sign in my onion and this has made my entry way better. Before reading this book i actually spotted something happen in a trade and tried to trade that which was the reversal points. His book just happened to fit the style i was trying to trade in which really helped me understand i should be waiting for confirmations. 

Okay now the bit which the lazy people will love but wont stay around here for long. Yes he directly shows you indicators you can use and does explain there not always going to work before you think hes tryna sell you the book to copy trade him. He gives multiples examples on indicators you could use which you can find easily on youtube but for some reason i just cant comprehend information on a you tube video as well as i can reading it and he polished over it for me. 

His style of writing is a easy read. He doesnt over complicated or go into depth fully into ideas and this is why you should try expand your knowledge before reading this book so its easier for certain things to click into place. 

He touches on price action and the psychology... Wow what have i been missing. Looking at candlesticks totally differently. In fact as soon as he mentioned this I got a ref by someone in my previous posts to read a book on price action and it went straight in my amazon basket. I cant say Andrew did the best in depth explanation on it and the book would be improved a lot if he went further into it so i wont be giving him the glory on this. 

He explained the simple ABCD chart tool which he also states how strategies have to change and develop as markets move because one strategy will not work all the time. 

He has his own style of trading and hes just showing you whats worked for him and puts some ideas in your head.

Conclusion: 

A great book to read as a beginner minding you i have only read 3 books on day trading. He sets the seed on where to look next to work on and potential ideas you were missing. My trading has been improved by the book although im in the middle of finding what works and doesn't. This book gave me structor on my trading which as a beginner you dont have any and i personally think you can improve as a begineer using the book as long as you rember too keep goals realistic and trading strategies die in time and also come back to life. The books made me look forward to what else there is to learn and even made me motivated as i finally made a constructive baby step in my trading.

t3_haeq4p,"The Most Important rule in Day Trading, Preserve your Capital","I have made quite a few posts about day trading and how it is possible.  Briefly, I started day trading at the end of 2007.  I lost money for the first six years.  My three biggest losing trades were between 15,000-30,000 dollars.  One thing I have not posted a lot about is when you lose trade after trade.  Today that was me.  All but one trade were on the long side and the market was considerably up. 

I started with a losing trade and then a second and then a third.  I honored all stops and was down roughly 175.  I had a couple trades that made a little bit of money and then lost a couple more and went down to -280.  After a couple scratch trades again, even as long as I have been doing this, it still can mess with your head.  Why arenât these working?  They work any other time, but today nothing.  Which brings me to my gamble.  I call trading gambling when you break your rules.  In this particular case the stock was MARK.  It can be a very volatile stock.  Meaning it can go up and down 5-10 cents in a second.  The number one rule for day trading is capital preservation.  If you cannot preserve your capital in a particular stock the way your rules say, you should not trade it.  Period.  But I am human and think maybe i get that 5-10 cents in my direction and get green.  Needless to say I took the trade and it dropped on me right away.  I lost another 400 bucks.  A guy I trade with once told me, bad trading causes bad trading.  That means if youâre not trading well, we can often take trades that we shouldnât out of a form of desperation.  I have skipped trading MARK countless times in the past but not today.  So now Iâve made a bad trade after already trading âbadâ.  Of course that just messes with your head mentally even more.

By 2 pm I was down 800 dollars after a couple more trades that didnât work.  The only trade I broke a rule on was MARK.  Hoping a trade would work that I would normally skip.  It accounted for half of my losses.  One thing I personally never do is stop trading because I am down.  If you have a strategy that is successful and has worked over a period of time, I personally never skip the set up because of my PnL.  

When you are down the desire is to make it all back in one trade.  Donât try to do that.  You have to stick to your strategy and rules and keep pressing forward.  One thing I do when things are not going my way is reduce my position size.  It helps you feel less stressed if a trade isnât working as well as builds your confidence back up when the trades start working.  So at 2pm thatâs what I finally did.  At the end of the day I was still red.  The market is up a considerable amount, Iâm a primarily long biased trader and I still didnât make a penny.  This isnât the first time itâs ever happened, and certainly wonât be the last.  Always remember, you have to preserve capital, you do this by sticking to your rules.  Today could have been far worse.

t3_hb7k3k,To the beginners out there...,"I understand there are many new traders out there who want to learn the methods of trading. We all started as beginners and I just wanted to tell you guys some tips from my experience! Now, by no means do I think I am a godly, perfect trader... in fact, I still make mistakes every once in a while. But I think I can boil down a few tips that helped me the most for people who want to learn this trade!

1. Patience. This is a hard game to understand. It is soo much more than just knowing some simple patterns or indicators. Trading encompasses much more than we all initially think. Some of the things you might want to take time to understand include just understanding how the market works in general. Use resources like Investopedia to gain a deeper understanding of many of the complex words and systems out there. Secondly, take the time to understand the economy! Look into the world around you and understand how certain events affect the market. This can play a much bigger role in your success than you think! Also, take the time to paper trade and practice patterns. Although I do not think paper trading is at all like real trading, it gives people who take the time a chance to gain more exposure... And that is the key. The more time you dedicate to watching the market and understanding, the better you can play the stocks! For me, I live on the west coast,  but I told myself that every day I will wake up at 5 to read and scan the market. As a college student, this is undoubtedly hard, but I have been at this for a while now and I truly believe the efforts have paid dividends! If you are a complete beginner, my recommendation is to start by watching Ricky G on youtube. He gives a very basic understanding of how to trade but I dislike his style. After you gain a little more of an understanding, give Humbled Trader and Live Traders some views. Try to understand what they are saying. Watch the full lectures and digest the free knowledge they provide. If you can get through all their content, lastly I'd recommend Steven Dux. His English is a little hard to understand but he spits knowledge that I like. The knowledge is out there and it's free, just take the time to look! I developed my style of trading by mixing Humbled Trader's news catalysts with Steven Dux's stock technicals! (I post my news watchlist daily if you want!)
2. On the topic of indicators and patterns to learn, I know this is repetitive to some, but honestly, just pick one and test it for a while!  You can use the resources I mentioned above to get a start. Remember, your pattern will end up to be uniquely yours! You will find your ways to interpret the market and patterns as well as the psychology of other traders. Believe in yourself and you might be surprised! My favorite play is the morning dip!
3. MONEY MANAGEMENT! Now I wanted to link this to what we commonly see on stock subs- Losses and Gains. I want to mention gains especially because I recommend you put the goals of trying to earn money out of your mind for the first couple months. Instead, approach this with a mindset to learn a skill. You should be fine never making a dollar for the first couple of months! I mention this because too many times we see other people make massive gains, this affects us no matter what. It is human nature to be jealous and try to beat the other person, at least for me it was. These emotions are what calls us to make FOMO type trades. Avoid them. Do not glorify other people's gains. You just do you! You should praise yourself for the slow consistent gains you make! Make sure to set stop losses always! Only trade what you understand and are comfortable with. Do not chase! I know the market is crazy these days with 300% jumps, but do not chase! It will build better habits for the future when the market has calmed down. Make sure you have target prices set and plans concretely set before you enter any trade. Be smart! On losses, take note of what can happen if you aren't careful. These are reminders that the market is dangerous so we should always be careful and wary especially when investing out own hard-earned money.
4. How to take a loss? Just take it. It's sad, it sucks and we all know how it feels. It sucks even more especially when you are right about a stocks' behavior but it stomps you out by a few cents. But at the end of the day, it's better to lose your set risk rather than to lose more than you can handle. Loss in part of the game, no way around it. For the longest time, I had a written on my board that I will learn to lose with grace. Look at every loss as a paid lesson you take. Make sure you reflect and see how you can improve next time!

These are my biggest tips for any trader that wants to learn! Now there are soo many more things that a trader needs to be wary of, but these helped me the absolute most! I might come out with more instructional pieces in the future but I wanted to put my thoughts into words for many people who ask me! For those who want to learn, I hope you can obtain some sort of motivation and knowledge from this post! I wish you all the best and good luck!!

t3_hb3nwn,DD - A bull's murky conclusion on CJJD's potential positive ER,"I'm new to technical trading so excuse my chart below along with any other indicators I'm not taking into consideration.

Having said that, after some DD I've identified some interesting indicators in terms of CJJD's stock. I've been reading on a lot of message boards that the stock did spike due to COVID-19. For those that have been following the company they'll know the the RDO plummeted the stock from around $3.40 to $1.40 within a day, wiping out lots of people's gains.

With their next ER due by July 1st, most would agree that the earning are going look significantly better than their previous earnings in February. Why not, CJJD has a massive presence in China both online and offline and given how badly they were hit by COVID-19 over the past few months they're poised to see massive jumps in revenue.

Since the RDO, Bulls (me included) have been waiting for the gap up to happen and get the stock back to +$3 again. But even with good news with the ER, I have reason to believe that the good press won't be enough to reach those levels anytime soon.

Allow me to explain; below is CJJD's chart and a legend underneath with critical news releases announced and how the market took to the news. Blue lines represents 3rd party press announcements and pink lines represents announcements from CJJD.

https://preview.redd.it/lz7xtlehak551.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac3171cd225976ad40e2d5816d421f814c63e6d

**A.** 1/5/20 Stock Candlestick = $1.75 - $1.66

* WHO published our first Disease Outbreak News on the new virus. This is a flagship technical publication to the scientific and public health communityÂ as well as global media. It contained a risk assessment and advice, and reported on what China had told the organization about the status of patients and the public health response on the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

**B.** 1/10/20 2020 Stock Candlestick = $1.96 - $1.77

* WHO issued a comprehensive package of technical guidance online with advice to all countries on how to detect, test and manage potential cases, based on what was known about the virus at the time.Â This guidance was shared with WHO's regional emergency directors to share with WHO representatives in countries.Â 
   * Based on experience with SARS and MERS and known modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, infection and prevention control guidance were published to protect health workers recommending droplet and contact precautions when caring for patients, and airborne precautions for aerosol generating procedures conducted by health workers.

**C.** 2/3/20 Stock Candlestick = $1.75 - $1.73

* WHO releases the international community'sÂ Strategic Preparedness and Response PlanÂ to help protect states with weaker health systems.Â 

**D.** 2/14/20 Stock Candlestick = $1.75 - $1.63

* Quarterly earnings report released.

**E.** 3/11/20 Stock Candlestick = $1.64 - $1.61

* Deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction, WHOÂ made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.

**F.** 4/14/20 Stock Candlestick = $2.14 - $2.10

* China Jo-Jo Drugstores Announces the Closing of $10 Million Registered Direct Offering

**G.** 6/1/20 Stock Candlestick = $1.82 - $1.36

* China Jo-Jo Drugstores Definitively Announces $10 Million Registered Direct Offering

\-----

From these data points you can see that the impressive ER released on 3/11 hardly moved the stocks price. Yes, within the first week it jumped 18% but within two weeks the price dropped to around the pre ER price.

My conclusion:

The ER coming within the next two weeks is going to have to be monumental to get the price back to +$3 and we're more likely to see those levels again when and if the second wave of COVID happens and it's internationally agreed upon that it's a pandemic.

At the end of the day I'm still bullish on the stock but I no longer expect to see a greater return in the short term than I will perhaps in the fall when a 2nd wave is more likely to take place.

That's my two cents, thanks for reading and I sincerely welcome anyone's feedback.

In the meantime, happy trading and stay safe out there!

t3_hc5vkm,DD - BOXL Bullish-ish,"There's two types of learning, in-person learning and distance learning. Before Boxlight released MimioConnect yesterday, about 75% of BOXL's value proposition was based around in-person learning experiences **in the classroom**. They have now broken new ground and taken one step further into the future of distance learning. But there's still one huge hole in there business model.

For this to work at scale, especially in the K-12 public segment, education departments need funding for both BOXL's software and hardware. Keep in mind that public education massively underfunded around the country. The cost of the software isn't the concern, it's the hardware costs that will hold back their growth potential.

In order to unlock BOXL's full collaboration, interaction and monitoring capabilities each student will require at least two devices for this to work ( A computer/tablet for the software and a second device to relay information to the teacher). In theory, one device could work, however the ease-of-use will drop so much the productivity levels of students will render BOXL useless. I encourage you to watch some of the videos on their website to see for yourself.

In addition, before the release of MimioConnect, the technology didn't have the functionality to connect outside of the classroom. MimioConnect has now fixed that and BOXL has other compelling offerings that have me bullish on company.

1. They offer a mobile app, which will allow underprivileged students to use their smart-phones if they can't afford a tablet/computer.
2. They integrate with the most commonly used platforms in education including Google Classroom, Microsoft 365, Schoology, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard. This will give teachers one source of truth for their e-learning initiatives.
3. They have an excellent distance based learning program that trains teachers on how to optimize the usage of the devices and software.
4. They sell their own hardware that's refurbished to drop the price-point.

Having said that, unless they completely redesign and reengineer their product (unlikely to happen) to enable a user-friendly approach on one device per student, their business model won't make this as attractive as many perceive.

However, I do see another option that will allow them to grow their business into the double digits, that many are estimating it will reach. The answer, give buyers the option to lease or rent the hardware, giving the schools and students more flexibility and opportunities to make this affordable.

In conclusion, there one of a few American e-learning companies that are trading and the one I'm by far the most Bullish on. Don't forget the private K-12 schools, Colleges/Universities and professional training segments have a lot more money than public schools. Right now my average is $.94 and as of today I see a projected ceiling of $4.5 - $4.75 per share in the LT.

Side note, I wouldn't be surprised if we hear news in the future about Chegg purchasing them and completely dominating the American market in e-learning.

t3_hcosfl,One week of NDX live interpretation and forecasting with Elliott waves,"Being interested in Elliott Waves for social dynamics research, I've tested its principles in practice for NASDAQ 100 index for one whole week (15-19 June). I've tried to interpret and forecast the index dynamics LIVE and twitted everything. I'm very new in Elliott Waves. Moreover, I've made some stupid mistakes posting live.

***Here is my vision for this week.*** Monday we've made a 12345 impulse. Tuesday has been the first step of correction: ABC completed and D started. Wednesday: completed D and E of the triangle, moreover, transited through X to a new ABCDE triangle. Thursday: completed this triangle, started a transition to the third part of the correction. Friday has been the most difficult day. An ABC correction has followed by a short impulse with a truncated fifth. Then, again ABC correction, where C had a form of diagonal. It has transitted to a short impulse with a truncated fifth.

Here is what I forecasted ***correctly***:

* Completed 12345 impulses on Monday and predicted correction for the next day; set a level indicating the correction (which was never passed, i.e., all other days was the correction from Monday)
* The first triangle at the very beginning of D (i.e., DE and the following raise predicted correctly)
* The second triangle and the following move was predicted quite close

***Mistakes***:

* The beginning of the first triangle I recognized as ABC aiming much lower
* On Tuesday, one corrective wave I described as a 12345 impulse down breaking main rules for the impulse
* Friday was a day of misinterpretations full of mistakes

***Conclusions.*** I'm impressed with the results. Being a newbie, for several times I was able to predict the following movements. Having only basic incomplete theoretical knowledge, I was able to describe a complex process that seems completely random for unprepared people.

Here is the final overview:

t3_hfo1p5,Is there any logical reasoning to support Elliot Wave Theory?,"I will give any theory a chance, so long as it has some logical reasoning. But in my opinion, Elliot Wave is the most BS TA theory. It is incredibly subjective.

**Compare it with these strategies....**

Moving averages = Not subjective. There is objectively only one slope of a curve that can be mathematically calculated. Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD, are all variations of this formula.

Support and resistance breakouts = A little subjective, but if you give 10 daytraders a chart, the majority of them will agree on similar lines.

Elliot Wave = No objective formula behind it. Everyone draws and interprets it differently. Highly unscientific and subjective.

To really confirm and investigate my beliefs, I went and read Robert Prechter's book: Elliot Wave Theory. [https://www.amazon.ca/Elliott-Wave-Principle-Market-Behavior/dp/0932750753](https://www.amazon.ca/Elliott-Wave-Principle-Market-Behavior/dp/0932750753) In it, he doesn't provide any reasoning behind why this theory works, he just shows different patterns of how to draw squiggly lines.

t3_hgvw1w,I keep falling for false positives. Any advice on my strategy?,"Any thoughts on my trading strategy? I keep falling for the false positives.

Hello yâall, currently I use chaunde momentum oscillator (CMO), MACD, Fibonacci retracement, and bollinger bands. I avoid stocks with news and I try to jump on the natural fluctuations of any particular stock. 
My strategy:
My entry markers are to look for a bullish trend from the CMO by the CMO line crossing the zero line. I then wait for confirmation from the MACD 12 day exponential average crossing the signal line to confirm the bullish trend and avoid false positives. I use the Fibonacci retracement and bollinger bands to help me predict resistances and supports. I look at 10 day 30 minute charts and 5 day 5 minutes charts to confirm if the stock Iâm looking at will move how I expect it. I use thinkorswim

Sometimes this strategy feels like it canât loose and other times I still end up falling for false positives. So here is my question; can you tell me what is wrong with my strategy? Are there any other studies that May help out? I have been developing my strategy since November and it feels like itâs getting very close to being something that can be really effective but Iâm still falling for things I shouldnât.

t3_hh5egw,What do you think of my lack of a trading strategy?,"
I've dabbled in trading for years study charts and indicators, writing complex algorithms and doing a bunch of analysis. Yet, I never found any success. Somehow I would always lose more than I've won but the following non-strategy has been consistently profitable for the last 2 years.

I should also mention that I don't use this strategy to day-trade per-se - I typically hold a position for a day or two, sometimes more - sometimes alot more - but it can certainly be scaled to trade on any time chart. 

Here's the strategy (if you can all that):

First, I only trade securities that I don't mind holding for a while. Typically, these are stocks whos companies I just like (TSLA) or technologies that I believe in (crypto). 

Then I only go long on a decent downturn. The idea is to be a buyer when a healthy amount of sellers are out of the market. 4% drop? I'm in! I open the initial trade with some small portion of my account (1-2%), sometimes more if I'm feeling confident or if there's a significant drop with high volatility (aka fear aka overeaction). I don't use any stop loss or anything like that. If it moves in my favor I try to ride out the profit until it finds resistance or if it just kinda moves laterally, Ill try to exit on a small profit or loss. But if it moves against me, I don't sell. If the move is relatively small (up to a few percent) I just hold and hope it rebounds. But if it moves even more against me, I buy more! At this point, I'm upside down in a position but because it's only a small portion of the account, I don't really care also because it's a company I like, I kinda just think of myself as an investor with some holdings in my long term portfolio - with that sort of horizon, it's not really important that you're down a 4-5%. So I just sit on it. If it moves up, because I purchased more and lowered my average price, Ill be profitable at a lower price than my initial position needed to be. So if it moves into a profitable zone, I kinda feel out the momentum to try and let profits run but really my initial position was a mistake so I just try to take 1-2% (or less if it's really struggling) and call it a day (trade). 
Now if the security moves against me a third time and/or the position REALLY tanks I buy even MORE! So now I'm in with like 10% of my account in a security that is eating it. But it's one I like so at least there's that. Again, I think of myself as an investor and hold, maybe collect some dividends at this point if I really get stuck. I still have 90% of my account to go trade something else in the meantime while this trade sits. 

Obviously, you can buy your way into a security that will lose 90% of its value and you'll be loading up on more and more of it on the way down. But again, your average price will trail along the more you buy at a lower price and as more and more sellers are cleared out of the market, buyers have to come along eventually and provide some support. And again I trade only stocks I like and have some intrinsic value (APPL, AMZN etc). Worst case I just end up holding shares in these companies. If I have enough shares I can trade options against then. 

But so far, I've managed to get in and out of positions taking very few losses. If anything, I'd say the downside is that the profits are a bit slow with this strategy. It's probably 95% wins with most wins at about 1-5% but they come only 1-2 times a week. Sometimes more frequently, sometimes less. YTD I'm up about 60% on my account which I guess isn't that much for you guys but it sure beats the S&amp;P",15,0.9400000000000001,1593305909,"[['AMZN', 1]]",AMZN,2630.080078125,3059.8798828125

Today was a wake up call for me, and I'd love some help please. 

As you may know, BA had an amazing day today. Looking at the chart is something to behold - it just kept climbing, gaining 24pts and closing at HOD. I traded only this stock today, and watched every minute of it unfold. YET I SOMEHOW MANAGED TO LOSE $4,000 WITHIN THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF TRADING. Thankfully, I ended green $900. But this should've been a massive green day for me, since I typically only trade BA. 

My problem is I'm soooo short biased, it's hard for me to go long on a trade. I don't know what it is. I feel like every time I buy a break out it tanks. Or every time I go long it immediately reverses on me. So despite an overwhelming bullish day, I still kept shorting the pullbacks instead of buying the breakouts.

t3_hhznl3,$VXRT Covid Play,"Vaxart (VXRT) - COVID Vaccine play

Who is Vaxart? 

I'm not going to boring you with the technical jargon. In another shell, Vaxart is a clinical-stage company engaging in the discovery and development of oral vaccines. They currently have several vaccines for other matters being developed. 

Why Vaxart? 

Vaxart was among several selected companies to partake in ""Operation Warp Speed (OWS)"". OWS aims to deliver 300 MILLION doses of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021. 

To touch in OWS real quick; OWS is a collaborated effort by the CDC, FDA, NIH, BARDA, and DoD. Funding is coming from Congress, whom directed almost $10 BILLION to the project. OWS has other companies working on a vaccine, along with Vaxart. 

https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/06/16/fact-sheet-explaining-operation-warp-speed.html

Speaking of the other companies, they're all working on an injection based vaccine. Vaxart is going outside the box to a pill, or tablet form. 

Why is this so special? Tablets are shelf-stable. Meaning, they do not need special transport and do not need refrigerated. This provides cost savings, as well as easier global distribution. There is also preliminary clinical research that shows Vaxart's tablets cause less side effects and prevents illnesses more effectively as opposed to an injection-based vaccine. 

Now you're asking; but what if another company develops a vaccine first?! Ahhh, I've go you covered. Well, because Vaxart is developing a tablet vaccine for COVID, it may still be a dominant force due to, again, cost savings and ease of distribution/storage. Also, if you need re-dosing, its easier to re-dose with a pill rather than injection. 

It must be noted that Vaxart is beginning its Phase 1 primate trials soon. 

""Expect Vaxart's stock to get a bump whenever it releases preliminary clinical trial data in any of its vaccine trials. Each positive piece of clinical trial evidence validates the merit of Vaxart's oral-vaccine platform, and investors should assume that the market will react accordingly.""

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/27/smart-investors-might-consider-buying-this-corona.aspx

""As a biotech start-up, Vaxart has no products on the market and trailing-12-month revenue of only $7.36 million. Nonetheless, its COVID-19 vaccine program is promising enough that the company is planning ahead for large-scale manufacturing of vaccine components, to support clinical trial operations in the near future.""

""Between VBI Vaccines and Vaxart, Vaxart is better positioned for stock growth stemming from its COVID-19 vaccine development program. The company's stock has already surgedÂ several timesÂ after new announcements about manufacturing scale-up, and positive news about the efficacy of its vaccine would likely raise share prices even more. In contrast, VBI appears to be struggling with its own manufacturing scale-up for clinical operations, leaving its COVID-19 vaccine candidate even further from the market than Vaxart's.""

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/27/better-coronavirus-stock-vbi-vaccines-or-vaxart.aspx

And as we must always save the best for last. Here is an article that goes into detail as to why Vaxart is better than the competition. Published Sunday night. 

https://insiderfinancial.com/forget-moderna-vaxart-stock-better-bet/180071/amp/?__twitter_impression=true

---Conclusion---

Vaxart is on the fast track for a solid COVID vaccine. The very killer of the global economy and our livelihoods. If they manage to find a vaccine, imagine what positive impacts this can have on the, most importantly, the world, but also, the economy. 

If you have any concerns, I'd love to hear them! Thank you.

**297.65** \- 50 day MA

**295.63 -** Unfilled gap

# Gameplan:

It's showtime folks. The numbers are there. If the bulls *can't* start closing above them soon, it'll mean trouble. A daily close above **306.53** however would be quite bullish and likely a signal this was nothing more than a correction and re-test of some very important numbers. **303.10** will be their first challenge should they make it there. **304 & 305** should prove to be short term stops assuming they make it through. 

If we don't do anything I listed above. Well. That's *bearish.* We're either on the way down or eating time off the clock to do so. **300** should prove to be important, though it's certainly lost some of its ""flair"". All eyes are on the 50 day MA @ **297.65**. Slightly below that is a gap we *almost* filled back in May but didn't quite make it (**295.63**). 

With the return of volatility, the important takeaway is ""*don't be long*"" if we can't find support at the 50 MA (**297.65**). A daily close below would surely bring out institutional selling. The next major number below would be a gap fill at **286.33** and with this volatility, it won't take long to get there.

t3_hhpmcs,Risk Management of Beginners!,"This week for my opinion's piece for beginners will be on everyone's FAVORITE topic... risk management hehe. 

No matter how boring you think this topic is, I want to emphasize that this topic is of the utmost importance for any trader that wants to try to sustain their accounts! You can think of this topic as the safety net for a daredevil, the helmet of a football player, or even the brake pad for your car. In other words, without risk management, you expose yourself to EXTREME levels of risks. 

With all the free resources about risk management scattered around the internet, it can be confusing for many beginners to interpret. I spent a fair amount of time trying to digest and use all of them which ultimately failed and overcomplicated things. I had written programs that would spit out numbers to follow and stop losses to set, but at the end of the day, simplicity can be the key! The following will be my opinion on the simplest and most straightforward way I was able to manage risk. 

**Setting Your Numbers**

First thing first, we have to be able to understand what types of losses we are able to sustain or willing to take on. The number I heard often during my research was that we should never be risking more than 1-3% of your account per trade. Although this is a good safe limit, I believe that there are many many ways to achieve this! What determines your method is completely up to the types of stocks you are trading. Let's start at the very lowest cap stocks (cheapest for the most part). This my personal favorite area to trade because we can see large swings of 10% in a matter of seconds. This, in fact, is the lower end because often stocks tank or rise 60%+ at a moment's notice. Because of volatility like this, if you decide to trade these stocks, I would advise to only trade a portion of your account. Maybe consider only having 20% in a trade at once. This way we can set a stop loss at anywhere from 5% to even 15% to remain above the 1-3% risk of the total account! You can judge how much you want to risk depending on the strength of the trade of course. Moving up to the large-cap stocks, these tend to move much slower so we can be safe maybe playing upwards of 60%+ of our accounts at once. This can allow us to place stop losses at maybe 3-5% instead! Both situations offer practically the same risk, but the difference is that we allow the more volatile stocks to move more because they need that kind of headroom. This idea can apply to different market caps as you can just adjust the amount of your account you are willing to risk while staying within the risk. Just make sure to take into account how volatile your stock is so you can give it enough room to consolidate and bounce!

After reading the above, it can sound complicated haha, but just figure out what types of stock you want to trade, determine the amount of room you want to give the stock, and set your position size accordingly. As long as you trade the same types, which you generally should, then you can use the same template for the rest of the trades as well! 

**Daily/Weekly/Monthly Limits**

Truthfully, as beginners, we don't usually have enough trades to be making many losing trades on a weekly basis. I have never really experienced that because of the PDT rule.  In fact, I think the PDT rules serve a good purpose to help keep beginners tame and only taking trades that have a HIGH chance to succeed. I followed this tactic and really only traded maybe once or twice a week. This way you should be able to stay out of trouble if you keep your stop losses set! If you do find yourself losing most trades! Consider paper trading again. Yes, it's boring, but you obviously need to figure something new. Don't over trade on a paper account, treat it like a real account by only trading the best setups! 

**Hard Stops vs. Soft Stops**

If you consider yourself a beginner and need help with risk management, use hard stops. Do not even consider soft stops, take the loss, and move on. Even if the stock bounces right after, this good practice will serve you better in future trades. On soft stops, only in the rarest of cases, when you are SURE that the catalyst should happen, then maybe if you grab a dice and roll two six's in a row can you consider a soft stop. 

**Why risk management?**

I have a unique perspective on risk management. I actually think that most times beginners are definitely not profitable, I wasn't for months. What risk management allows you to do is gain experience playing with REAL money and REAL sizes. This is super important as nothing beats real trading stress and emotions. With proper risk management, we subject ourselves to more of this in order to practice strategies and techniques to hopefully achieve a viable system before our money runs out! If we can, we can slowly build back our accounts and become profitable! (hopefully!) Without risk management, accounts can be wiped in weeks, and so will be the drive and passion to learn more.

Good luck to all and let's have a great week!

Although all of this has been more than helpful so far and has provided me with a solid foundation for my trading journey, I now find myself needing a more structured course but don't feel like spending 6k on it.

t3_hjn5ua,"Low capital($300-$1,000) and experienced day traders, get in here.","
I had a pretty decent start I guess you could say. For the  past 2 weeks, I'm up 42% from initial investment which I understand isn't big deal because a toddler could make money in this market. I'm sole proof of that, my research is limited and I only focus on analyzing and following/reversing trends but I'm not a toddler. 

TLDR; Questions and the bottom. 

However, this somewhat inspired me to put a bit more money into it to have more diversity. I try to stick to something simple, and to lower cost stock ($3-$15) to maximize gain, this works for me so far but doesn't mean it will in the future, I have read the sidebar but I'd like some personal experience opinions. 

What indicators do you recommend learning for low capital investing? 

Do/did you use stop loss - take profit with such low start up, or did you manually observe and Sell/Buy at convenience?

Currently on TOS I use RSI indicator and price and volume trend (I don't understand P+V Trend TBH.) and have only been able to long because i think I'm restricted to shorting. 

What I'd like to know; 1) your personal experiences with a small account. 2) the indicators you use/recommend using and why. 3) if your experienced and have a decent portfolio, does stop loss/take profit work out well for you? I can't imagine on smaller priced stocks but maybe on $100+ it works better. 4) what is your ratio for $50, $100, $500, and $1,000 stocks for SL/TP. 5) If your experienced - do you prefer day chart trading with a weeks analysis or swing trading with 15-20 day analysis  and why.

ASK yourself this question seriously and answer yourself soberly.

My questions to you is:

1. Do you know the good setups (when is a good probability for a trade to work and when is not)? if not then more study is required.

2. Do you really understand that even THE BEST setups fail????

3. If so what are the probabilities (percentage wise) of the setups working? Do they work out 50% of the time? 60%? 70% 80% 90%?

4. If you know the good setups and their probabilities, then how do you trade them? Do you mechanically take the trade according to a predefined plan and set of rules, or is it willy nilly (50 shares here, 200 shares there, an idea where to get in but NO IDEA where to get out... especially when the trade goes against you.)

t3_hkgycy,Any UK based day trader want to collaborate with a programmer?,"I am a senior software developer who ran some algos in the past (several years ago) to trade futures contracts. I did make a couple grand in the first couple months and ended up quitting a couple grand net negative in the following months, at which point I quit and stayed away from it for several years now. (I was in 20's back then when such amount of money mattered a great deal).

Now I am several years older, bit more mature in mental and programming skills. I am looking to find one another experienced day trader as a strategist partner to start building an algo system properly from the ground up. To not waste anyone's time, I will write below what it is that I am thinking of building. I understand many have different ideas and may disagree with me. I am only interested in partnering with a person who agrees with me on the overall design and if we disagree on small bits, we can discuss more of course.

&#x200B;

* Technical analysis based strategies that make 1 trade per day with hard profit target exit and stop loss (in terms of % loss) across many instruments. All remaining opened positions will be closed at market close each day to leave no overnight risk.
* Human input (will make a UI for it) to configure on which days which instrument should be completely ignored and no position should ever be opened for it. (ex. scheduled economic reports days where technical analysis don't apply well, or dramatic events like COVID where the entire market is impacted all across. At times like this I would like to just turn off these TA based algos for like 1-2 weeks. If we want to manually trade these irrational times on the side... we can... but that's a different endeavours all together in my opinion.)
* I don't believe in back-testing too much, I would like to put more efforts into live-testing.
* All strategies will be running in simulation mode and monitored their daily performance everyday regardless of them being trading with real money or not.
* At the start of each day, capital allocation is calculated for all eligible strategies. out of above simulation results, only the ones that recently (x number of days look back) performed well above some threshold will be eligible for capital allocation to be traded with live account each day.
* Capital allocation is weighted based on their recent performance.
* We will put an adjustable parameter in terms of how many days to look back for ""recent performance"" evaluation. This is per instrument. I think this is an important human intervention to the system. Small look back days means we think that the market is rapidly changing and we want to be more aggressively adaptive (maybe like the year 2020). Longer look back days means market is trending in one direction with not much noise (ex. years when S&P just trends up) and we would like to ignore noise in the short term losses in the P&L.

* Positions opened based on TA based signals
* Positions closed based on profit target

t3_hlq4b1,"An introduction to Divergences, (and a little RSI, Volume Profiles, Channel Trading, Shorting, Fibonacci) and 4 Examples of Analyzing a Stock","**Divergences**

**How powerful are they?** [https://chrt.biz/SPY/1242592a025/chart/](https://chrt.biz/SPY/1242592a025/chart/)

This was DMed to me. This person clearly has technical knowledge (he knows was a **MACD divergence** is) and wanted a critique of his analysis and not a ""stock tip"" so I told him I'd only do it if I could post it for others and they agreed.

(Their text)

>**Short**: $**FAST** (short term) there is a divergence in the daily macd, and moving close to overbought. Fairly far from the 5sma too. looking for another exaustive push up to short.**Long**: $**VTR** looks like it is setting up for bands gathering, if it can hold above the 100 ema. the 200 is still above, but I find that with most stocks due to the crash.**Long**: $**NEE** has a gathering of bands, looking for a bounce, or potentially to enter very soon after a minor pullback. This looks like one of your ribbion textbook trades you have posted.**Short**, looks as though $**BIO** is creating a new short channel, I would be looking to enter if it closes below the new hammer hihg, and TI exit would be the 100 MA.

And here is how I go about it that works for me:

**FAST:** [https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242591es0r/chart/](https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242591es0r/chart/)

First I drew the **MACD divergence** in the two red lines. I don't usually count gaps in divergences when they are the right most candle so ignore the gap candle. (top right white candle up by itself) We draw the red line from those 2 highs as shown.

Now we go to the **MACD** at the bottom and use the **crosshairs** to make sure we are are on the **same candle**. **Connect the high's** of the **MACD** the same way. **When your indicators are doing something different from price action** this is **a Divergence**. It is the first video I watched when I thought, wow, trading is actually a learnable skill and started me down this path. It also can be **the most profitable trades you can find** because they can signal the signs of a **major reversal**. I've also actually seen a 1 candle that was both a cycle high and low and was considered a divergence so this is a part of our **overall trading plan**, not something we just trade when we see it by itself.

You can have divergences on many indicators. This person uses the **MACD** so we will use that for our chart\*\*. I use Stochastic, **MACD** and **OnBalanceVolume** for **divergences,** though I use some unusual settings I was taught when I started.

For new traders I recommend starting with trying to find divergences using the **RSI** only. It is simple with only one line and the default settings on any platform work perfectly to show when the strength of a trend is weakening. Later you can choose to try others. I actually have built in divergence drawing indicators on my platforms that draw those lines on things like my **Stochastic** and **MACD** for me, that's how powerful and important they are to my trading.

Back to our chart: [https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242591es0r/chart/](https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242591es0r/chart/)

**He said we have a ""risk of exhaustion""**

Now, going back to our **Moving Average Lesson** we can see that our moving averages are in a perfect bullish order (5, 20, 50, 100, 200). I would never long a stock so far above the 5 SMA. Price **gapped up** so he wants to **short** it. Sounds good to me. We can see the **20 EMA** and **5 SMA** are below price.

The **divergence** shows that momentum is leaving the stock while price is going up. As price goes higher supply of the stock goes down making everyone a buyer with no sellers left. This is called **Risk of Exhaustion** (which he correctly pointed out) and causes normal **profit taking** that causes price to come down to a more affordable level so new **participants** join the party.

Now he said that **""we are about to exit overbought"".** I will let you research the **RSI** more on your own, but I don't see that one on the RSI (exiting **overbought** means price is about to come down over the 70 line on RSI, but our daily chart does not show this.) The gap likely made that RSI stay so high up so I will pull up a **shorter term chart**. The **4 hour** still show the **RSI** still up. Let's try a 1 hour chart.

[https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242598ksqn/chart/](https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242598ksqn/chart/)

**There's our divergence!** Price made a **higher high**, but the **RSI** is making a **lower low**. It's a small lower low (down to the wick), but in relation to the higher high on price, that is a **significant enough difference** to be of interest to me.

Back to our daily chart ( [https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242591es0r/chart/](https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242591es0r/chart/) )we can see the the **20 EMA** and **5 SMA** are below price but above our trend line. Good candidates for support. After a gap up, the momentum down can be strong sometimes, so we would want to see price move so swiftly that it goes straight for the **20 EMA** and likely pierces it with a **wick** to the **trend line**. (Sort of like it did on May 4th where our lower trend starts).

**Advanced**

I used **Anchored Volume Profile** on trendspider's charts, which shows those grey bars on the right, at what price the volume came in at. I anchored the volume profile at the most recent high so we can see most volume since then came in at around 41.50.

I used the **Fibonacci** tool and anchored it to the most recent high and the lowest low of the new trend. We can see that the .**382** (not important) Fib line is exactly at the volume shelf.

I drew a lower trend line (since we are shorting) connecting the two lows of our trend. We can see a perfect alignment of the trend line with our **Fib** .**382** and the **volume shelf point of control.**

These converging (pun intended) elements are of interest to me. We have **Fib** line, the **volume shelf**, our **trend line**.. lets see if we can find one more from our last lesson? We have **2 moving averages** within our range that look like good candidates to be **support** if we go **short**, sure enough, they align with our other elements. Because a **gap** is so violent, we would hope for it to ""fill the gap"" (cause price action to go down and go back through the gap area normally, ""filling it in"".

Here is the initial plan I would be looking at after my preliminary analysis

[https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242598b6fi/chart/](https://chrt.biz/FAST/1242598b6fi/chart/)

**Briefly on the last ones:**

**Long: VTR**

[https://chrt.biz/VTR/1242591heeb/chart/](https://chrt.biz/VTR/1242591heeb/chart/)

5 crossing 15, 15 cross 100, 50 about to cross 100 (Golden Cross). Big volume shelf and the 200 MA well above but all moving averages rising to it (a bullish sign LT because it means we have a lot of upward profit potential. When the 200 MA is so far above (as many are with the crash) it means we are coming back through a previous range which causes momentum. **Good**

**Long: NEE**

[https://chrt.biz/NEE/1242591rbx7/chart/](https://chrt.biz/NEE/1242591rbx7/chart/)

Drew some trend lines and found a Bullish channel. Nice volume shelf, all moving averages are bullish according to our rules. Lots of upward moment and a ""**moving average cluster**"" from our second lesson! The 5 is about the cross the 20 and that's the last cross before total alignment. **Good**

**Short: BIO**

He said we have a bearish channel, which I was able to find. However even though we have an **inverted hammer** it was at the **end of the day on a Thursday before a three day weekend. Timing matters.** As you can see we broke above it and found support on the 50 SMA. The 5 is about to cross over the 20 and the 20 over the 50 so this is a sign of **bearish trend break** and a trend reversal to me.

Some of this is simplified and I'm sure there's errors but this should give some some people stuff to work on. Please. Do not buy anything I post as an example as a suggestion to buy a stock.

Will try to get to replies today but will be busy during the week.

This is ""base scan"" that you would then apply a strategy to. These could be long or short, they are simply stocks are likely to have very good setups. I broaden this a little more and use it as my ""Scan in"" for **Thinkorswim** so I can apply a pre-filtered list of Volatile Stocks to any other setup scan that I run.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**If you want to know why I pick what works for me**

Probably the hardest thing for any trader to get good at is learning how to find their own stocks. It took me years and is what I spend more time on anything. It is the single thing that separates professional traders (people who make a living trading their own money) and people who don't.

**Why do you care?**

Even if you trust the person you get tips from, they will be gone one day.

You will make less money starting out. You will make more money longer for the rest of your life with proper risk management picking your own stocks.

&#x200B;

**========== Beginner ==========**

We want a price range. A volume range. And stocks that have the potential to move. (volitility)

&#x200B;

**Price**

**Low**: A simple cut off is $10 minimum. You can absolutely trade less but you will start getting into more stocks that are more heavily manipulated.

**High**: $50 is good if you have a $5k account. You will get much better gains from smaller cap stocks. the risk is also higher, but you are not risking much with an account that small.

Once you get to $25k, $200-$250 is a nice cap. You can absolutely trade TSLA and others over a thousand but you seldom make as much.

**Price > 5 and < 200**

&#x200B;

**Volume**

**Two kinds of volume** \- volume for the day and the average volume over a time period (I use a 20 for daytrading or 30 for swingtrading, daily SMA of the Volume).

You want stocks that are above the **daily average** of volume, showing that investors have interest in it and it will move. TOS has a built in scan called Unusual Volume. Any scanner code would be something like

**Volume is greater than SMA(Volume, Length=20, Aggregate=Day)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Volitility**

Volume is a good filter, but we want stocks that can really move a big portion of their price percentage inside of a day for daytrading.

I use the **ATR Percentage**, which is simply percentage of the ATR in relation to the stocks price. It is one of my favorite filters to pick higher R / R stocks.

**(ATR(""length"" = 30) / Close) \* 100 > 5**

This is a **5**% range filter. Changing it to a **3**% will give you more results, but they will have less potential for movement.

As always, **google everything**, like **ATRP** and see if you even agree with it Maybe you prefer the ""volume sizzle"" filter in TOS. **Find your own best setup.**

***Google*** *Volatility Stocks,  Daily average volume, Moving Average of volume, Average True Range Percentage*

&#x200B;

**========== Intermediate ==========**

(I use Finviz and Market Smith for these)

**Share Float Groups** Float is the shares a company has available to investors. The float percentage or ratio would show you what shares are held by insiders or other non-public shares.

Under 1M

Between 1 and 3M

Between 3 and 10M

Greater than 10M

&#x200B;

**Market cap** is the value of a company's shares. A lower market cap usually has a higher risk reward (it moves more) than a high market cap. I do not apply market cap filters unless I am doing a Micro/nano play but they could help if you are having trouble.

Mega Cap: Market cap of $200 billion and greater

Big Cap: $10 billion and greater

Mid Cap: $2 billion to $10 billion

Small Cap: $300 million to $2 billion

Micro Cap: $50 million to $300 million

Nano Cap: Under $50 million

(likely not 100% accurate)

I group market caps in **1-10M, 10M-100 million**, **100M-1bllion** and > **1B**

The 100M-1B group is my recommendation for most traders (you could up the high end) and what I trade the most. If i trade a nano or micro I use an very different set of criteria than I do for anything else. 100M-1B are at less risk for turning violently against you but have very good profit potential.

For **microcap** and **nanocap filters**

**1-20 price, Cap 200M, Float 0-10M with a Turnover of 1-5% (volume / shares)**

&#x200B;

The **short float** is what shares are available to short. These are held by brokers usually or you can call and request your broker find you shares so you can short a stock.

The **short interest** is the shares that have been shorted but not yet closed. A very high short interest can setup very big short squeezes that yield the highest profit potential in the shortest amount of time. (there is of course a Long Squeeze no one talks about)

&#x200B;

**========== Advanced ==========**

**What I studied next to build on this**

**Sector Rotations**

[https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/rrg/?s=xlb,xlc,xle,xlf,xli,xlk,xlp,xlre,xlu,xlv,xly&b=spy](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/rrg/?s=xlb,xlc,xle,xlf,xli,xlk,xlp,xlre,xlu,xlv,xly&b=spy)

***Google*** *Sector Rotations, ETF Relative Strength, Relative Rotation Graph (RRG)*

Even in daytrading it is helpful to know what sectors are about to boom (did software just finish a run and now semi's are up?) (gold and silver respond very differently if the vxx is up or down) and what ones are going to correct. These are very repeatable and knowable things that happen over and over and can really help you start to get a feel for the market. It has cycles, rotations and a flow that you can use to help ""go with that flow"" to maximize your profits and minimize your losses. I use Seeking Alpha, ETFDB and [Stockcharts.com](https://Stockcharts.com) for sector research.

Find good people who do a brief **weekly analysis video** of the market on the weekend to go over the previous week and prepare you for the next week. Right now I like Brian Shannon and Trendspider.

Read a **weekend publication** that gives you the same thing. Do not do daily's - way too much information and it promotes FOMO. I read a lot - this year I have found useful information from IDB.

Don't discount the value of the past. The best traders I know anticipated this market crash and made a ton of money on the recovery because they studied past market crashes. History repeats itself more than you would know.

**No Results?**

In pre-market, TOS is picky about about average volume and price depending on your instrument. I use ""mark"" ""last"" and ""close"" for different things with different success.  Similarly with volume, you may have issues doing comparative scans against average daily volume. Wait for market open or tweak your scans.

&#x200B;

**Good luck. Be safe.**

**Summary**

Globalstar is a USA based company that provides asset tracking, cellular data and voice, and more via itâs own satellite system. These are critical in commercial markets such as transportation, construction, and utilities where items are very expensive or communication is critical, but hard to access. There is an Executive Order from the White House to remove all foreign adversary telecom equipment from our utilities and power grid due to risk of cyber attacks. This puts Globalstar in a great position as they recently pushed out their new ST-100 product AND bought 5G spectrum (band n53) to be used in utilities applications (which they showed off at a conference this month with Nokia. They are partnered with Jeep and have an upcoming earnings report for Q2. Insiders own 64% of shares and have been loading up according to SEC filings. The future seems very bright for this one and Iâm hoping we caught it early.

**This is the first trade I learned that started making me consistent profits.**

**It takes 1 moving average and a candlestick chart.**

**It works on stocks, volitile ETFs, and Futures.**

**It works on a 1 minute chart to a weekly chart or tick charts.**

**It has defined entry and exits down to the penny with estimated profit target with defined stop loss.**

**Very little risk with good reward.**

Always stocks available to **consider** for trading.

&#x200B;

**It works for long and short.**

All references are for **Longing**. Shorting works perfectly the exact opposite.

The **50 SMA** direction reflects the **trend** of a stock. When price suddenly goes **off course** but recovers we get a **divergence**. We can use this to **capture the move back to the trend** (reversion to the mean). Most results are not winners. You have to look at the charts.

**How to Trade it**

We want a **trend of the 50 MA**. We want **price below it**. We want a **hammer** candle. A hammer forms when price opens, tests the bottom of a candle (yellow line), goes back up and **turns green** then moves higher than before. Once it goes green, we know we are going to reverse to the upside. **Buy** 1 cent above the **HIGH** of the hammer. (green line) Your **stop** goes 1 cent below the **OPEN** of the hammer (because that means the candle would go from **green to red**\- showing a now bearish reversal (red line).

Profit target is the 50 MA. (thats a general one, use your own judgement)

That chart above is perfect - **good** long green trend, a quick divergence, with a hammer and 50 SMA angling up.

This is **bad**:  [https://i.ibb.co/pncXb40/image.png](https://i.ibb.co/pncXb40/image.png)

The 50 MA is changing trends constantly so we do not know what is a diversion and what is a reversal.

**Color Changing 50 SMA Indicator for TOS:**  [http://tos.mx/yAszO1Q](http://tos.mx/yAszO1Q)

**Risk Reward**

If the hammer body is too big (still fine to trade as long as its all wick below and will be a hammer when you enter. But if the body is too big it might make your stop so far from the entry that the risk reward is too large. These are little 1-15 min scalp trades for a couple hundred bucks. Good constant trades that build accounts quickly. So the smaller the body on the hammer the lower the risk.

**I Scan for:**

50 SMA angling up

5 SMA under 50SMA

Stochastic K Angling Up

Price 5-200

Volume daily average 500K

Dotted are Daily, solid are hourly

A follow up from yesterdays post on NKLA. As I went over yesterday I received information on this stock and wanted to break it down. I made a plan for all outcomes. Let see how I did:

I said I would not buy unless we held that trend line and reclaimed the 5 SMA(green thin) and preferable retested it. The red line on the lower trend line is the AVWAP YTD (upper red dotted), as I mentioned yesterday. If a moving average were there I would would have had more faith in it holding. I said we were at risk for falling to the 50 and we did in fact (I actually thought we'd hold) so I would not have gone long. When we broke the lower trend would be a great short to the 50.

We did find support there for now, so drew a new trend line from the new low to low it took out (same as before) We find our 50 Daily SMA is right on that trend so I have a good feeling this will hold but I follow my same plan because I had no idea if yesterdays would hold. Refer to yesterdays post but same thing we want to see. Price reclaim the 5 SMA for a while, I like retests. On stocks beat down, I sell at resistance and sooner and a lot more ""partials along the way"" because there is so much of it. For stocks that are making new highs, I like to let them run more.

I probably would not want to go long until it reclaimed that old trend at least but thats just me. I bet a lot of people just made a bit on that big bounce a moment ago. Lots of ways to trade a stock - just find your time frame and plan and don't change it after you set out to accomplish it.

Now good alerts would be any of those trend lines, any ""moving average breakthrough"" or ""touch"" alerts. The first crosses on this stock that would put the moving averages of alignment would be a 5Daily SMA/20 Daily EMA so that is another alert I set. A 5/50 cross (less meaningful) shows a stability but I don't value that cross as much(I like one MA crossing over the next up or down, not 2 or 3 down). It creates shows a stock is recovering in a stable manner that will hold support in times of stress.

Price is below the 5 Daily SMA right now, so it is resistance. When price closes a body of the candle above, it is the support. Does not mean it holds, but those are the first signs of a reversal, whether its a couple candles that then go to 0or a 1 month runner.

If you can't do advanced stuff just start drawing trend lines. They do not have to be perfect. A simple price alert level at a meaningful point on the chart works just as well.

**If I had one point to impress on anyone its retests/second runs are more often than not more probably than initial breakouts so ""missing the breakout"" is actually not a bad thing.**

That's exactly how I do it, every day. Start a chart, add to it over time, Set alerts.

t3_hmkd4n,Day Trading Sanity Check,"Hi All,

A bit about my exposure to stocks trading:

My dad used to trade stocks when I was young (2000's). I never understood how he made money as a day trader, but I know he did very well for himself. He paid off the house, purchased additional real estate, and gave to charity.  All I remember him engraining in my head was ""buy low, sell high"" or ""buy on the rumor sell on the news"". He's not around anymore, so I can't pick his brain on the techniques and strategies now that I have my own money :) 

8 years ago I quit my company and rolled over my retirement in a rollover IRA. I put it all in APPL when it was under $100 a share. I made a significant amount, right before the market bottomed this year. I cashed out 2/3 of APPL and diversified my portfolio in big tech and others. I also made separate ""individual"" account for day trading and put 30K liquid into a similar portfolio, and did well since then.  

Iâve been tinkering with Finviz and, found a few big winners in my book. On my first trading session last week I made about $90 shorting a few volatile stocks, and today, I made $328.

Today I spent the day looking for opportunities to buy in than last week I did a quick trade or 2 in 10 minutes.

I look at the pre market and look for a trend, and average what I think the stock would be worth at market open, then I set a limit order to purchase.  But I want to make more conscious decisions when it comes to charting, and separately, when it comes to smaller OTC/penny stocks, what research process is done to assure itâs a good buy. As an example, $BLNK looks like it will be good long term, but I want to understand how to do due diligence on how to look for red flags.

I'll be honest, I'm not a big fan of the gap list today. Many stocks that are gapping are the same stocks that have just been slowly grinding higher every day, most are very overbought and lack a catalyst such as earnings. Next week things should hopefully pick up as AA will kick off earnings on July 15 which will bring in some catalyst and set up some new plays. For now, if you don't see anything you like, run a scan after the open to find momentum movers. If I see anything good before the open, I'll update this list. Good luck trading.

If you have more than 1 contract sell half and see if it pushes through the resistance. Roku needs volume, keep on eye on it, ride the 9 ema. Looking to buy 7/17 170c.

t3_hpzjzt,Tracking your trading performance,"Hi all just wanted to make a post regarding how to track trading performance. It's a major ingredient in becoming a successful trader that too many new and experienced traders aren't utilizing. Trading is at its core a performance based business. How much money you make long term will be dependent on how skilled of a trader you are. Most elite/top performing traders actually spend more time documenting/reviewing their trading than they do actually trading.  Although luck can play a part in someone's success (see wallstreetbets) it is not sustainable long term and those traders will give back profit/blow up eventually. Thus you should be focusing most of your time on *how to get better* rather than finding that ""perfect trading strategy"" that doesn't exist. Stop wasting your time changing up what indicators or set ups you use every week because you are never going to become consistently profitable doing that. You need to focus on a very specific trading style or set up(s) that are comfortable for you to then go on to master through performance tracking.

There are many ways to go about tracking your performance. I'm going to list out some of the best practices that have helped me in my career.

1. Documenting trading stats. The most important stats you should be documenting every trading day is your win rate, avg win vs loss, biggest win, biggest loss, pnl, volume. These stats are crucial in seeing where you and your system stand. To do this you can manually create a spread sheet and export trade data to then calculate each stat OR check out trader Vue and upload stats there. There's probably other ways to go about this but just try and find a way to easily view your trading stats not only for one day, but for a week month, year. You will use these stats as a benchmark for your trading.
2. Documenting top trades. Each weekend I perform a weekly recap where I find my top wins and my tops losses on the week. I'm fortunate to trade with a prop firm and my trades and trading stats are strictly tracked for me. All I have to do is set a date range for the week then sort by top win/loss. I believe Tradervue is able to do the same thing however I don't have much experience with them. Although I do this every weekend you may want to do it every day or every month. It's totally up to you in what you find beneficial. I sort by top pnl trades however you may also want to track opportunity trades. You may have an avg winner that would've been 10x if you just held on. You don't want to overlook these trades as they can be just as or more useful than your top trades.

When I'm documenting trades I refer back to my trading notebook where I actively wrote notes on trades through the day. I use a notebook while I trade to write down my thoughts through the trading day. This may be earnings/Eco events, market analysis, trade ideas, emotional thoughts etc. I'll review what I was writing when I took this trade to get a better idea on how and why the trade happened. I then will mark the exact entries and exits on the chart and discuss the trade. How I found the stock, the trade idea, how well I executed the trade and how I may have done it better. It's important to also note if the trade should or shouldn't have been taken. Just because you made money on a trade doesn't mean it's a good trade or one you should be taking. Vice versa for a losing trade. Just because you loss money doesn't mean you should stop taking the set up. Really review the trade and ask yourself if this is something I should or shouldn't be doing and take note of that.

After documenting these trades I will take a screenshot and save into a folder. I will study and take notes on these trades to try and replicate the winners while eliminating the bad losing habits. After awhile you will have a pretty solid data base of trades you can go over to find trades you should be taking more of and trades you shouldn't be taking at all. I print the top 5-10 trades after each month and keep them in a binder

3. Journaling. I have separate trade journals for every day, week, month, quarter and year. I mostly use a journal as a quick over view of how the above stats are going for the given time period. I've created question templates that I fill out for each journal to keep my journaling consistent and efficient. These questions involve asking yourself things such as what are your current trading stats? What can you do to bring in more profit or reduce losses? What are your goals and how are you going to achieve them? Journals dont have to be essays. Most of my daily journals are maybe a page or so long while i spend more time and go into more detail on my trading in the longer term recaps. I print out my longer term journals and save them into a binger along with my top trades for that period and review them regularly.

4. Using the data. It's one thing to document and track, but another to actually use the data. Just because you track what your doing and finding out what you should be doing doesnt mean anything until you \*actually start doing it\* . If you do the above it should be pretty easy to find characteristics in your trading that are good and bad. Your job then is to write out rules for yourself on how to take advantage of those characteristics. Find your having too many larger than intended losses? Size down in your trades, make it a goal for yourself this week to have no losses over $x amount. Work on stopping out immediately when your stop loss is hit. Properly plan your trades before entering by writing the plan physically into your notebook. Waaaaaaay too many developing traders do this where they're otherwise profitable but the odd larger than intended losses is making them break even or negative. Thats just one example of the many you can find by tracking your trading stats. Others may include you find you cant trade a certain stock well, you cant trade well during a certain time of day, your over trading out of boredom/fomo, your profitable on your first 5 trades but after 10 give back all your profits. Etc etc. Really dive deep into these stats and find your weaknesses to then focus on improving through setting goals for yourself. A important thing to note is you may find 10 different things you want to work on. DO NOT try and fix  every one of these things at once. Pick ONE like eliminating large losses then only focus on that 1 goal to achieve for this week or month. Once youve consistently solved this problem you can then go onto improving win rate, making more in your trades etc. But do not over load yourself because you will not be able to handle it and your progress will be severely reduced. Another thing to note is these problems wont ever go away, you can just make them less frequent. The best traders still have bad losses or bad weeks. They have just figured out ways to make them less of a problem.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps. There's certainly some things I missed but I feel pretty confident this will give a lot of you  good ideas on how to start tracking your performance. Again it's not like you HAVE to do it just like I said.

People don't realize that he is referring to people with HUGE CAPITAL. When you are working with 50k it's different than trading 50 million. I can very well make 15% in a month with 50k but would differently not be able to replicate that with a 50 million account. He even said it himself

 ""i*f I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, Iâd be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return Iâve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. Itâs a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million.* *No, I know I could. I* ***guarantee*** *that.â*

*My end goal is to reach a number in which when get there I would be fully retired because although day trading is definitely more free and rewarding than working a standard job at the end of day you are still working. Once I reach my end goal through real estate and yes Long term investing with sp500 I would be better off getting my 5- 10% annually on my main account than my day trading account 50k and making 7-10k a month until then I will day trade as its the most rewarding way I can make money and currently defiantly more the sp500 can make.*",80,0.91,1594568126,"[['%5EGSPC', 4], ['HUGE', 1]]",%5EGSPC,3149.429931640625,3258.610107421875

Expectancy tells us how a strategy will perform if we apply the same approach (average R-Multiple). R-Multiples let us see our average risk adjusted return. These tools work together to allow traders to analyze strategies and make adjustments. If you're only thinking about POP, you're missing an even more important part of the conversation.

I've seen mixed things on the internet about those guys. Someone pointed out Ross essentially does live streams, gets all his followers on a stock, the price inflates, and then he bails. Others said Tim Sykes did the same.

When I listen to a guy like Tim Grittani talk, he just seems a lot more believable and seems to talk with a more humble technical approach. When Tim Sykes talks its this weird like yelling fashion that he has where I just get shivers lol. I do wonder why if Tim Grittani is such a succesful trader on his own, why he deals with Sykes and all these weird 'student' mentorship stuff.

Is Tim Grittanis success real? Achievable (realistically by others)?I guess the reason I ask, are Dux and Grittani just lottery winners? Did pure skill bring them there? Is their caliber of success achievable by others if you are smart and put in the work?

I figured I'd ask you guys because I feel like I could get a much more real answer. I feel like I've seen in the past that they are 2 out of 1000 traders who made it successful. I'd believe that, my only caveat being how many of those other 998 were the Lambo thirsting finance bro you see on instagram who wants to get rich quick.

# Gameplan:

With JPM reporting strong earnings, many believe other banks will follow later this week. This sentiment combined with a lot of untested 'resistance' levels above us could provide us with at least a small bounce today.

Once again **314.50** is on the board as it is my pivot level. Above and we're *bullish*, below is *bearish*. 

To the north we have a couple of price targets. The most important from a daily close perspective is **317.90**. In this area is a downward trendline drawn from all time highs which we've never closed above. Also important is the **319.00** level should price reach there. The market profile chart has single prints from **314 -> 319**. What's that mean? Single prints signify emotional moves in the markets. These are areas price is likely to revisit or retest. Price can tend to move fairly quickly through low volume areas as well.

South of the border, we have some weaker support at **312.70**. Below this is where things really fall apart for the bulls. We'll then look to the moving averages to provide stronger support. 

Out of the gate I'll be watching to see if prices can hold around or above yesterdays low for at least the first hour. Should we be able to do that, put a stop below the low of day and take profit at the signposts on the way up. The later day trading will be risky as it's possible the selling comes hot and heavy at any resistance along the way.

t3_hqrp79,7/13 Watchlist,"Hello Guys,

Today was a crazy day, hope everyone was sized correctly and followed their plans.
Just a reminder that this post ir for educational purpose and not a recommendation to buy.

I want to start first with some of the rules i follow, they are simple rules:

1-. No FOMO (fear of missing out), this is something that it will take a long time to get over but i think this is  one of the mayor cause of loosing money. So no FOMO.
2.- Have a plan, look for setups, i added a picture of stock patterns and what are they going to do, remember these setups could fail and will fail, so have an exit plan. Print this and put it next to your desk.

https://imgur.com/a/GxnFBQg

3.- Size properly, a rule of thumb is use 10% of your account on a trade, if you are too heavy on a trade, emotions will kick in and will make you do mistakes and not follow your plan.

4.- Donât over trade, you canât catch them all, grab a couple of stock and follow them, if you have 10 open plays and shit like today happens again (it will) you will panic sell.

Ok if you have any questions with my rules let me know.

BA

It made the list again, still think this will push, now, we hace news about a 1.2 B deal with the airforce, thatâs what this stock needs to push. Now, the setup is going to depend of how the stock opens and the overall market, banks report in the morning, if everything is going to the shitter donât start buying stock left and rigth, let them settle and confirmed it wants to push.

So like today 157.41 keeps being a good support, if tomorrow BA hasnât push, wash for this level to take it long, remember it has to confirm that it wants to hold the support.

If in the morning BA is over 181.61, that will be your new support and itâs the same play, if it goes down and hold 181.61, take it long.

Breaks 175.41 grab puts.

JPM

I like this one but it has earnings tomorrow, watch how it reacts to earnings, i put some targets, watch for the pennant to break up or down. Remember wait for pull backs, donât chase.

t3_hrnek9,Recommended Helpful Traders on this Sub,"This is more of an appreciation post and a post for those newer traders looking for guidance. There is a lot of fluff out there but I've had some wonderful interactions with 4 redditors in particular that have either offered their expertise in pointing out what my failings are, or bounced charting ideas and market theory ideas off of. Even shared strategies with, and tested strategies together. Trading can be lonely, no one I know can speak about trading in an engaging level IRL. So I also appreciate most people  on this subreddit wanting to better themselves and others. Here are some genuine people who are here to help without any hidden agendas (in my order of ""meeting"" them):

u/Kant_sleep13 \- Equity trader, creates a daily watch list he posts here and has really useful stickies on his page along with videos. He's a straightforward dude who tells it like it is and doesn't care for nonsense. He's probably not interested in talking to you unless you HAVE A PLAN! When I first started out he taught me about gaps, R ratios, position sizing, and stop losses.  I literally wasn't using stops when I first spoke with him.  He also turned me onto quite a few different strats such as ORB, 3BP, Triangles, Fades, Breakdowns ect.

u/zimmertrading \- Options, equities, long term strategies. This guy is young, like 20! But he has his shit together and his level of knowledge of the overall market far surpasses what I am willing to learn right now. He is a statistical based trader as we all should be. Friendly and open to chat, and posts weekly videos about market sentiment. I credit him for driving me to look deeper into ITM/OTM/ATM options, market structure, and since we tested a strategy together, about discipline. It is crazy how two people can have the same exact trading plan laid out for them but different results. It goes to show how important execution and trade management can be.

u/esInvests \- This guy is also very kind and open to discussing questions, he has made it clear he is here to help. I have asked him a question, and he responded in about 10 minutes with a 5 min video going over my question. He trades options mostly, running modified wheels. His videos have taught me a ton, and they are quick and easy on YT.

u/UncleRyan79 \- Equity trader, has changed my trading life giving out free material on reddit and his twitter almost daily. He is a really nice guy, who is happy to answer questions. If you check out his page and go through the posts in order, he has a few strategies that have clicked for me. I've surely benefited.

None of these guys have asked me for anything, and they have all been super helpful in the last 6-7 months. People wanting to help on reddit catch a lot of shit at first, people do not trust them assuming there is an agenda, MODs block them for whatever reason, and people argue with them because their strategies don't match their own. At the end of the day, everyone trades differently. It is based on personality, on how much you can handle risk wise, and how you control emotions, so no two traders are going to be alike. Not everyone is willing to share their p/l, so you got to have a nose for who is taking you for a ride.  I've learned different core concepts from each of these guys so even if they were shitty traders, those lessons have helped me become more.

I can vouch for these 4 if you are looking for no BS content. As always google questions first before approaching them, and also check out their page content before you start asking questions. I'm sure they get a lot of the same ones. I'm also sure there are other helpful folks, but these are the guys that I've come across in my experience on Reddit.  Good luck!

t3_hrj53j,Fundamental questions about patterns,"Hi all.

I've been fascinated by the financial market for some time now. But I have always been wondering **why are there patterns in stocks?**

Is this due to the fact that there is an abundance of day traders (or companies) that spend their time analysing the market and playing on these patterns? This would mean if everyone sees a pattern that would be bullish that everyone would buy a stock so it does indeed go up. Does this mean that it is a psychological game? The patterns work because everyone thinks they work that way?

Or is it just the nature of stocks, and there is nothing to do about it. I invest plentiful in stocks for the long-term (10+ years), so I don't pay attention to patterns. But do I indirectly, unknowingly, add to the effect of the pattern? Or are people like me that make a bearish pattern eventually bullish because I am not paying attention to the patterns? Connected to this question is then: do patterns only work if there is a certain ratio of short term / long term traders?
I want to understand more about this subject; not just by looking up patterns and blindly agreeing it is bullish or bearish; but by understanding the fundamentals of patterns, why do they appear, who makes them appear, and whether it's all just psychological warfare.

As a bonus question, does it make a difference to look at patterns in months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds? Does this just depend on how many active traders are trading in that time period? e.g. if no one actively trades in hours, then it doesn't make sense to do it (this couples back to the fact that active traders agree on patterns, so psychological effect).

If anyone can clear that up for me, thanks :D You can ask these questions somewhat in google but the answers are not deep enough.",8,0.91,1594797729,"[['GOOG', 1]]",GOOG,1498.0,1570.0
t3_hrhr6v,ES Long 32pts 3129 -> 3161 & Short for tomorrow,"Caught a nice 32pt Long from 3129 to 3160.75 this morning, nice 30 some pts. Entry was at the LVN inside the value area (bottom red crayon drawing) indicating unfair prices at that level, but given how the value area extended past it, i placed the stop nearest next LVN which was below the VAL. Stop a bit wide at 3115.  Woke up to see the trade already filled and managed from there, noticed the session was either going to range or reverse so i closed right next to my initial TP at 3160 (top LVN inside the value area - top red crayon line) for 30pts.

Move for tomorrow:

Looking at the weekly volume profile for a reversal short at the 3119 area next to the HVN (red crayon), target towards 3195 to fill the gap from todays evening session gap up, and to also hit this week's VAH.  Though, i was filled at a bad entry at 3209. May potentially fall more towards today's sessions' POC at 3155 but that's a reach. 3172 - this Month's VAH (not shown) would be a more realistic target.

Since the Tradingveiw subreddit is kind of dead and no one responded I am posting my questions here instead.

(1) Yesterday (16/7) I was watching NIO as I was watching a streamer who also had an eye on it and noticed that the fifth candlestick (9:05) on my Tradingview chart was red while on his it appeared as a green one. Any idea what caused this?

t3_htqsx1,FSLY Trade Review/Repair," Hey everyone. Had a trade sent over in FSLY that had quite a bit going on. It started on 6 July w/ a (4) short 65/105 strangles. After it started moving, he began adjusting the strangle (took the puts down, rolled the calls) then added more calls and eventually put on a 90 straddle as well. 

A few notes.

* Let the trade work. Intervention should be a last line. We should afford the trade every opportunity to work.
* Be focused in your repair strategy. Having defined criteria and adjustments will make the trade easier to manage.
* Take advantage of opportunity. He saw great premium in a straddle and went for it - despite the rest of the position not doing well. 
* When adding different legs and strategies, I like to track separately then add the total PnLs together - makes following the position quite a bit easier. 

Specific approach outline is below. Feel free to send your broken trades in, happy to discuss strategy!

t3_hte2do,Random Questions,"Things seem to be really slow around here recently (I guess because it's summer), so I just wanted to post a few random questions I was interested in.

1) For stocks, what price range do you usually trade and why?

2) How many shares/what position size do you usually trade? I do understand this is going to differ from time to time due to risk management and other issues.

I'll start...

1) I trade stocks in the $1-$5 range. I do this because I don't have a large account and I can take larger position size. Also, I find that the level 2 for stocks in this price range easier to read/use (level 2 plays a vital role in my strategy) than large cap/more expensive stocks like GE and F.

2) I'd say the average position size I take is around 5,000 shares. I'd like to eventually get this up to the 10,000-20,000 position size.

t3_huaeir,FX/Crypto Trader turns to Options,"Hey day trading,

I've been trading crypto and FX for about 3.5 years now, and wanted to give options a go. I started off with a **SMALL** account (As I'd recommend to any beginner traders), and I'm glad I did.

Options feels so different than crypto & fx that I almost feel like I started at a disadvantage, trying to ignore a lot of concepts in the other worlds.

One thing I'm huge on is storing ALL data on trades I took, entries, exits, etc, and learning from this. **If you're losing trades and not learning from your losses, they're very likely to continue.**

I wanted to share the top 4 things I've learned in just 1 week of trading options:

1. Not having an **established stop loss** CRUSHED me. I'm HUGE on risk management, but I come from a background of stopping out of trades at -2 to -5% which obviously doesn't work with options and the way they swing (you'll need to size down on your portfolio entry percentage to accomodate!). I wasn't sure where to set that number when I started.
2. Pay attention to **low volume / Open Interest** on contracts. I had quite a few self-driven plays that I entered into contracts with almost no volume or open interest, and as a result, I could not get out of them even close to when I wanted to; all of them were in profit at some point, but I took a loss on every single one.
3. **Take profit**! This is similar to #1 where, again, I'm used to taking profit around 2 to 10% at most on trades. I couldn't figure out how to set this number when I started earlier, and a lot of trades ran a good amount in profit before reversing and stopping me out.
4. **Follow the trend**!!! I'm very used to picking reversals in trends, it's basically my entire strategy in crypto/fx. In essence, I'm a ""knife catcher"" in those markets, and it works extremely well if you play it right. Knife catching options (both buying in downtrends, and selling the top of uptrends) did not work well for me, regardless of the fact that my TA was correct in nearly every example I used it. I'm not 100% sure why, likely due to IV changes, all the greeks combined, that price wasn't driving my options that far into profitability.

That's all I've got to share - Hope this helps at least one of you out there who might be experiencing similar problems, or those who are just getting started and can learn from it.

**One other recommendation**: get yourself a group (discord, any other chat platform) that you can trade and chat with others in. One where you can bounce ideas off of others, and learn from their successes & mistakes. If you want a link to the discord I'm in, DM me.

Good luck trading everyone! I'm excited for week #2 in the options world. Let me know if you want to hear about my week 2 learnings afterwards :)",3,0.81,1595200843,"[['HUGE', 1], ['TA', 1], ['DM', 1]]",HUGE,3.809999942779541,3.890000104904175

t3_hu2o4v,My Advice!," Hi all, I want to give back to this community a little because of the sheer amount it helped me when I first started. I have come up close to 1 year of my trading journey and am finally starting to see profitability and consistency. I have only really daytraded for about 5 months (and yes this isnât long at all, but after finally crawling out of a 5-6k hole and  now being well in the green I know Iâm finally doing something right). As for the total year I tried to dabble in a bit of everything I.e. stocks, options, swinging, scalping etc. soaking up any bit of information I could get my hands on! After an insane amount of red, I began to realize that daytrading suited me most because I could control everything and wasnât ever drastically effected by any unsystematic/systematic risks that occurs when doing something like swinging. As of recently, I have hit my milestone in growing my account from **1.5k to 10k in a month.** (And no it obviously wasn't really a month but rather a year of dabbling and climbing out of REDNESSS, my consistency has finally started to show.)

**1.** You must, must, must find some sort of edge. At the beginning of my day trading experience I kept dabbling in a range of different setups until I started to really notice and understand which ones worked and which ones didnât *(big emphasis on which ones didnât*, because honestly a lot of them didnât). To this day, I make most of my money from 3 **setups that literally repeat and repeat** like patterns but I am constantly trying to expand my playbook (making sure to lower my size when doing so).  And if you ask, hey what are these setups?  I donât rlly feel comfortable in sharing because A) it took a longtime for me to figure this out for myself (i.e. literally staying up from **11:30pm - 6am** every weekday watching the markets and also studying/watching videos during the day - whilst having commitments like uni and work :) ) and B) they might not work for you. Also, you should *trust in the process*, because part of getting good and getting past that learning curve is criticizing yourself and figuring out what works and what doesnât. If you never go through that process you will struggle big time. 

**2.** Please **learn to read the tape**. The order book and time and sales is essential, if you donât have these tools you are at a severe disadvantage. For example, when I enter long on a 9ema/21ema consolidation, I am looking for heaps of orders coming in through the T&amp;amp;amp;S above or at the bid because this tells me buying pressure is coming in. And for example another scenario, if I am shorting, I know my directional bias is likely to be correct when the orders on the ask begin to stack up with lots of support behind me and orders on the bid are relatively thin in comparison (Nick Fabrio talks about this in the Chat with Traders podcast)

**3.** Trading is literally all about risk to reward. If your reward isn't atleast 2.5-3x your risk why are you even taking the trade. Unless you are certain that the probability of success is incredibly high (which is something you figure out from your excel spreadsheet of different setups and their probabilities), it is incredibly silly. Expanding on this, moving your stop-loss is literally altering your R:R ratio so please unless you are 100% positive that your original stop-loss was dead-stupid, take the loss and cut the runner short. 

**4.** Where do you put stops? You need to understand the structure of your charts on all timeframes. Before I trade any name im putting in support and resistances on daily/hourly timeframes so I know the key levels in play. Depending on your strategy you can choose to put stops just below pivots, or just below support levels etc. Additionally, nice numbers is a thing, so e.g. (when short) don't put your stop as $6. Put it at $6.01. When long, don't put your stop at $5.01, put it at $4.99. I don't know why nice numbers are a thing, but they are and there have been countless times where my stops were too tight and I was stopped out by 1 cent due to 'nice' numbers.  (whole dollars and half dollars especially)

**5.** Leading on from this --&amp;amp;gt; The awareness on multiple timeframes thing is something recent that I heard in a chatwithtraders podcast and oh my god is it true. You need to start understanding where people are going to be entering on multiple timeframes, because remember not everyone in the orderbook right now is a daytrader like you. E.g. I tend to not short at the HOD break unless I see heavy resistance because at this point you have multiple buyers stepping in at multiple timeframes... 

**6.** This is also something that I only really realized recently (after having so many trades where I was deep green and having them turn only a little green/red). How should you be taking profit?  For most of my plays I would say e.g. short at $z and set a target for say $z-1. I would then let the trade run and I guess take 50% profit and then full profit when the stock was nearing $z-1. The problem with this, is that I was leaving sooooo much more money on the table. I.e there are so many micro moves (e.g. shorts covering off support, buyers stepping in) within one macro move and it is easy to predict where people are going to cover their shorts etc just by looking at ur chart for 2 seconds. (again this market microstructure stuff) From this, I started covering right where/a little before people would cover and then re enter when the stock would consolidate back to say the 21 ema or something. By doing this I have profited from that little âmicroâ pullback that was incredibly predictable within the big macro move (that didnât even fully have to play out). So in the end, you've made money off the one big move + all the micro moves. anyways hope that made sense (itâs 3am rn so Iâm a fuking vegetable) (also no I donât set a profit target of $1. That was just an example, I shouldâve instead used an arbitrary value $k to clear up confusion)

**7.**  Watch heaps of videos of people that are better than you and try soak up as much information as possible. Most people try to find one video that would teach them everything but problem with this is there is no one video. Everything about learning day trading is just soaking in as much info as possible from a heap of different sources. Additionally, you do not have to pay for any courses... everything I did was completely free and I made sure to have a onenote where I stored heaps of notes from different videos. 

Here are some channels I watched:

**Dan from TheChartGuys!!**

\- I would strongly recommend thechartguys as a great starting point with the multitude of videos on TA/trade recaps (dan in my opinion is one of the best traders I have ever watched, and he is by far the most consistent, systematic and genius of them all!! He has such a beast probabilistic mindset that puts him in front of a lot of other traders. This is something I really admire about him) you donât need to buy his course though.

**W-ar-riorTrading** (sorry formatting is weird, it wouldnât let me post)

\- To be quite frank, Ross isnât a very good trader in my eyes, he seems quite sloppy and inconsistent. E.g. Heâs the type to really chase those whole dollar and half dollar breaks without even considering the tape and the current overextension of a stock. And yes, he does make money so I donât want to shit on him - but Iâve just seen better traders out there... He has some nice vids on L2 data and live trading, so I would go check that out.

**SMB Capital** 

\- Look at their setups videos with example trades

**Seven Points Capital**

\- Love a good recap from Michael Kats and the team. 

**Chat with Traders**

\- I think I have watched over 100 hrs of interviews... Just type in daytrading and hit most viewed.... 

**6.** **Get on Twitter!** Follow daytraders that are better than you, i.e. Nick Fabrio, Michael Katz (anyone from any chat with traders video). 

And finally, here are some little **mini tips**

\- Don't size up until you are consistent. I have made huge mistakes of sizing up when I thought I had it all laid out after a few decent trades, and then got a huge reality check.

\- You are going to miss so many moves that happen in front of your eyes (i.e. FOMO). It happens and yes it fucking sucks but don't get in now because your R;R ratio has completely changed

\- Know where you are going to get out before you get in.

\- Please try only use limit orders (atleast for entries), market makers literally fill you wherever the fuck they want. What I would do is for example if you want to enter at $6. set your limit for $6.05 just incase the price explodes (and you should know if you are buying at an area where price will explode, e.g. a key support level/breakout level). For exits I currently use market stops which is bad, sooo much slippage (I am going to start fading into stop-limits though with a slippage factor.)

\- If you don't have hotkeys, you are at a disadvantage. Too much clicking is bad and slows you down/is very stressful. I currently have 3 hotkeys - a 50% take profit, 100% take profit, and cancel order hotkey. I still think I need more lol. 

\- Paper trading is fucking useless and doesn't teach anything. If you want to learn but dont want to lose big, open an account with tradezero and 2k equity - best way to learn is when you lose. If you are paper trading, I am telling you right now you are wasting your time. Because of human psychology, trading when money is on the line versus paper is a completely different game. I could go into so many things you will do when trading real money vs paper but I cant be fucked right now so just trust me. 

\- Create notes. I have a mistakes notebook where I literally document every trade mistake I ever do. Yes, when you lose money it hurts and you record it (something you wont do on paper trading). Additionally, have an excel spreadsheet of your % winrate and also P&amp;amp;amp;L

\- Just a couple things about my trading --&amp;amp;gt; I use tradezero for execution and tradingview for charting (When I first started I used to use the stockbot !pop command on discord servers but have then moved to the tradingview scanner, I think I need to eventually find something a little more professional like tradeideas.) **VWAP** is the most essential thing on my chart, without it I would not trade. I use 9 ema's and 21'emas (depending on the strategy, sometimes they arenât used at all) that help me gouge different entries. When trading any name, I have a split screen between the 1 min and 3 min timeframe and then another tab where I flick through the 5min/15min/hourly/daily time frame (usually always on the 5 min). Before I trade any name, im putting in key support/resistance areas at pivots levels on these higher timeframes. 

- also did I mention volume! Thatâs a super important thing Iâm looking at, again depending on my strategy

Anyways, for anyone that is interested I do document all my recent trades on my instagram account so if you want to come aboard on my journey chuck me a DM and ill give you the @.  (Edit: a lot of ppl are asking, itâs @thewolfofshortstreet You can ask me questions there too!)

t3_htusa5,Can someone help me make sure Iâm not missing something about wash sale rules?,"So Iâve read wash sale rule explanations a few dozen times. I understand it is mainly about not being able to claim the loss for taxes. What I donât understand is how/why it changes my end cost basis. 

If I buy 100 shares at 10$, sell most at a loss at 9$ and buy back in at 8.50 to sell when it hits 10 again. Why does my broker app say I need to break 10.05$ (or whatever it is over 10) for a âprofit?â I lost 10 dollars but made back 15 for a total profit of 5$, but the whole wash sale âadding to cost basisâ will list my purchase price as something over 10$ if I donât care about writing off those 10$ thatâs one thing, but still donât understand the WHY/HOW it changes my listed purchase price.

The pure math of what I paid (185$ spent in and 190$ taken out) makes sense, Similar to an average cost method, but I use TDA and it automatically adjusts my âpurchase priceâ and it would tell me I would be at a loss if I sold at 10. 

I was day trading a stock that bounced from $10 to $8 throughout a day but opened that day by selling for a loss intending to swing trade that bounce. Buying at 8 selling around 9 throughout the day, by the end of the day my trading app would tell me Iâm down x many dollars by the end of the day when purely subtracting dollars spent buying from dollars made selling I should end the day with more dollars.

Where am I supposed to think that money goes? Iâve had someone help me with taxes in the past but Iâve started very actively trading recently and I donât want to dig myself into a tax hole...

Some things you should know about me are that I am 18 years old. I am a new trader( today is my first time day trading). Everything I know about day trading I got from reading books. 

P.S because I am new to this, I donât expect to do as well as others, and I am doing this more for an experience of day trading. 

Day 1: Today, the day ended with my account down $45.59.

My main trades were: $OPK, $ACRS, $KNOS, and $TBLT

I am still holding 300 stocks of $TBLT and 1110 stocks of $KNOS because I think that this week they have the potential to go up 100%-300%.

t3_huqobw,ATR trailing stop strategy,"Many top trading pros use the ATR trailing stop (with varying settings) to enter(long or short). To the contrary, many YouTube fake trading experts say, âyou donât use ATR trailing stops for entry, just to exit at a loss or to let a profitable trade become less profitable.â The former are focused on winning and donât use a well-known zone to get trapped by algorithms, but ride on the back of algorithms to victory. The latter are focused on losing, âoh no, my position is losing, I hope my stock turns direction or Iâll eat my loss at the ATR trailing stop.â Why wait on a massively used stop level to eat a loss? Sometimes yes, but if a trade is not working in a reasonable amount of time, I prefer cutting quick to keep losses smaller (when possible) and entering at a better time or abandoning that trade idea.HEREâS THE APPROACH TO USING ATR TRAILING STOPS A PRO taught me.ENTER LONG when price breaks the ATR trailing stop to the upside on the 15min chart, if price is also above the ATR trailing stop on the 5min chart (or if price breaks above the 5min if already above the 15min), and the stock generally looks bullish as confirmed by other indicators like MACD, etc. Consider exiting quick if price turns fast and canât hold above the 5 and/or 15min ATR trailing stop that the price just broke through. DO THE OPPOSITE FOR SHORT PLAYS.A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH is to jump in early as price moves towards the ATR trailing stop (but before it breaks through). Also, looking where the ATR trailing stop sits on the 5 and 15 minute charts is a good indicator of whether the short term trend is bullish or bearish.

t3_huf59w,GoatFish a bot framework for leveraged trading,"So I wanted to get into algo-trading last year, more specifically in crypto, but I didn't want to simply spot buy and sell crypto assets, imo those markets lack liquidity, and liquidity is king

So I decided to build a bot for leveraged trading of Bitcoin. Long story short, I saw a gap in the market: no one had built a bot framework for leveraged trading in crypto.

So thats just what Ive been doing in my free time over the past year, and since it's almost done. I think now is the time for fellow enthusiast to take a look and rip it apart.

A bit of context, on what the tool does and is:

**Background**  
GoatFish is meant to be an infrastructure that allows you to dynamically run custom code in a vacuum (a docker container). while taking care of all the other elements of algotrading for you. All the streaming information from the exchange, all the order setting, backtesting, paperTrading.... is carried out an an application layer and the user doesn't have to worry about it.

**Exchanges**  
Currently it only supports Bitmex, but it is structured to be able to add any an all exchanges a user may want to add with very little effort(as long as its leveraged trading).

**Strategies**  
All you need to deploy a strategy is:

* A bot name
* A unique set of API keys
* A strategy, which can come in the form of a single file or several folders
* A preferred exchange
* A preferred timeframe \[defaults to all timeframes if not specified\]

This information will then be used to keep track of all your positions all of your orders and automatically connect the strategy to the chosen exchange, and submit/cancel/ammend orders when necessary.

Additionally the bot functionality allows you to dynamically switch between actions. A bot can just as easily:

1. livetrade
2. papertrade
3. backtest
4. stop

**Analytics**  
The application provides real time analytics and scoring your strategies against each other.

**Progress**  
As it stand the application is a series of dockerised endpoints that communicate through kafka. They each all work together and individually to deploy and run strategies. How ever usage at the moment is  
limited o how knowledgable you are of the endpoints and their use, so I will be starting the development of a CLI with accompanying documentation to make it more accessible.

Im also very much aware the code is not perfect, but it does fairly well, a test strategy has been running a trade/min for the last 22 days with out any downtime.  
That being said I know it can be very much improved and welcome any and all suggestions.

Oh and ofc it's open sourced!

I've been dabbling in the stock market the past few months for extra income. I started out with Acorns, then switched to M1 Finance, then on to Fidelity, caught a Good Faith Violation, and am in the process of switching to TD Ameritrade. I've been lucky not to lose my ass, but have still learned some hard lessons. 

I've been all over the place with positions in various Vanguard ETFs (VOO, VGT, etc), some select blue chip stocks (DIS, MSFT (does DKNG count?)), and even a combo of dumb luck (GNUS, IDEX, TTOO, CARV,) and garbage luck (BBRW,  PASO, XSPA, JAKK) with penny stocks. 

Come next week, I'll have transferred my Fidelity account to a TD Ameritrade account so I can take a more technical approach with ThinkOrSwim (ToS), instead of this emotional FOMO one, even though I've been lucky enough to turn a respectable profit.

As the title states, I want to hoe out my Cake Day today for some tips to be more analytical with ToS, as opposed to just getting lucky. If there is either some constructive advice, some helpful YouTube channels, tutorials on coding (I have SOME general coding experience) , or anything that would be deemed helpful for someone looking to take a more technical approach with ToS to get consistent gains (5%+ daily, or a better advice on consistent daily percentages), I welcome all helpful advice and strategies.

I do welcome general advice (books on day trading, etc), but if I can get some tips on scans, charts, studies, custom coding or ANYTHING that could help me better understand how to maneuver ToS, I will be very appreciate.

t3_hvuw5s,Caught in overnight short position and got wrecked,"I was shorting TWLO late yesterday. It looked like the techs wanted to pull back. Looking back it was a bad idea since TWLO was strong relative to market, but at the time it looked like it wanted to give up another $1 or so.

Anyway, I lost track of the time and market closed. I was still in my short position. There were 0 sellers. I left an order in overnight to get out at a small loss, but never got filled. I could have gotten out at a significant loss, but I didn't want to take it at that point... I was still hopeful of getting out at a small loss or break-even, or even making a profit (ha ha... foolish fool).

Anyway, TWLO did not pull back at open. I held for a little and watched my P/L get bigger and redder. There was a pullback to around 263, and again it looked like it wanted to go down... I set stop-loss at 265 and just accepted my punishment. Good thing too, since it ripped up to 270 soon after.

So yeah, I took a $1500 loss to the face today. It's my biggest loss yet. I had my biggest winning day recently. It was about $1100. So I gave that back and then some.

Feels bad... Thought I'd share my pain. Anyway, I'm done for the day and probably the week too. Roast me, advise me, or console me... Whatever y'all want to do.

**319.10** \- Poor low

# Gameplan:

Yesterday we had some consolidation action with a sell-off into the end of the day. Bulls will be looking to hold the **325** level and climb back into yesterday's value area. Bears are in control should we remain below **325**. That's the pivot.

Should we trade lower, **323** was Friday's breakout area and should prove to be resistance. Below that and we have plenty of smaller support, however, the larger destination would be the poor low from 7/16.

As I said in yesterday's postmarket thoughts - there's nothing bearish about this market. But where does that change? A daily close below **323** would get me watching. Getting below **317.50** on high momentum would get be watching. Closing a day below the 20 MA at **314.28** would *really* get me watching. But until any of these things actually happen, we're *bullish*.

Decided to add another short at 3266 to scalp with a stop above those who got top-ticked, on top of my existing overnight short. Saw another 166 contracts getting top-ticked (second red arrow). At this point i moved my stop for the scalp to 3265.75 (highest blue horizontal line near 2nd arrow). Figured that Bulls wont break past the volume that was traded at that point - ended up being right since i was 1ticks from being stopped out at that point. Then I saw another 185 contracts getting top-ticked again (3rd red arrow) followed by a slight drop in price with selling imbalances, so i moved my stop down again to the 2nd blue horizontal line (bottom one). Could have added in size if i were practicing sizing here. Next thing ya know, the tape started flashing and it sold off for the rest of the day.

Focus is mainly on earnings plays as they will usually perform the best during earnings season. Business as usual for active day traders.

t3_hw99wq,The real reason it's important to find your own trading style,"I think many new traders do not understand the importance of actually finding their own âtrading styleâ. Furthermore, they do not understand why they canât replicate the strategies from profitable traders.

Beginners tend to get caught in the trap of trying to find the âsecretâ method to a successful trading style. This is simply not true. The real secret is finding a trading style that will work for you.

Let me give you a simple analogy.

Shooting threes all game like Steph Curry does will give you significant edge to win championships. But we all know mortal beings like us will not be able to perform on those levels.Â 

Yet, new traders believe they can replicate other traderâs successful strategy. In fact, theyâre willing to pay thousands.

I donât blame them. A lot of these strategies are marketed in a way thatâs easy to understand and it seems easy to learn.

Strategies such as head and shoulder, break out, abcd pattern are oversold by everyone on their âtrading educationâ website.

These strategies are all very easy to understand, and therefore most newbies will try to learn and apply these when they go live. And of course, many will fail. In the long run, almost all will fail.

**Hereâs the thing... ANYONE can trade a break out/abcd pattern/ head&shoulder, etc.**Â 

These patterns are all over the market.Â 

Ask yourself this.Â 

If you trade every single abcd pattern, do you really have an edge?

No. Your chance of success will be no better than a coin flip in the long run. Which means youâll most likely just end up with 50/50 success rate given risk-to-reward is 1:1.Â 

Which also means, if you execute it perfectly, youâll net zero. However, youâll actually be in the red because of human errors, commissions, and fees.Â 

So why does it seem to work for these traders that teaches them?

Itâs because they most likely have an edge (which they probably wonât tell you).Â 

For example, they might be a master at reading tape. So whenever they see a break out, they will read the tape to confirm an entry. This means these traders wonât be trading every single break-out. Instead, they will only trade ones where the tape confirms their trades. They will still be wrong sometimes, but now they will be wrong less. They may have a 55% success rate because of their edge, and thatâs more than enough to make them profit consistently.Â 

Okay, so why donât we just implement that? Again, think back to why most people cannot shoot deep 3s Steph Curry.Â 

Market data are only useful to you if you can interpret them the right way.Â 

You see some online guru say âlearn to read the tape and youâll be profitableâ and you think thatâs your road to six figure income. It might work for them. But itâs probably not going to work for you unless you know what youâre doing.

Anyone who has tried reading tape knows it just seems like a number generator on steroid.Â 

If you cannot learn to read the tape correctly, then you have no edge over this strategy. Which means if you try to learn this guruâs method, youâll fail miserably.

Soâ¦ does that mean learning how other people trade is bad?

Of course not. Itâs never bad to expand your knowledge. In fact, I would say itâs essential to help you develop your own. Just donât pay loads of money for useless info.

You can watch and read about other traderâs insights to reinforce your own method. Consider what other people are doing and ask yourself if these methodology can be applied to your own style and help you improve.Â 

DONâT just try to copy people blindly or you will most likely fail.Â 

What you should really be doing is work on execution. You should spend most of your time on simulator or live trade (with small money), chart studying, reading books from reputable trader about insights and trading psychology.Â 

Stop wasting time googling âthe secret to becoming a profitable traderâ and watching other people live trade.Â 

Just trade. Youâll make a lot of mistakes in the beginning, but you have to learn from all your failures. Thatâs really the only way to become better.

In my opinion, when youâre grinding through your losses in the beginning, what youâre really trying to do is eliminate trading styles that doesnât work for you.

Maybe you come to realize youâre not a great scalper. Stop doing that.

You learn you suck at reading tape. That wonât help you in trading then.Â 

You learn you read level 2 pretty well. Work on that.

Then you realize indicators donât really help you. Take those off your charts.

You realize you read volume pretty well. Work on that.

You realize you seem to do better trading longer time frame because of your risk management. Keep doing that.

Play to your strength, rather than trying to improve your weakness.Â 

You might not be able to shoot 3sâ like Steph, but you can do lay ups pretty consistently.Â 

After many many trial and errors (which can take a few months to most likely a few years)â¦ if youâre still in the game, maybe you will have developed a trading methodology that works for you. And itâs almost certain that not many people will be able to replicate it, even if you try to teach them.Â 

This is because every decision in discretionary trading is subjective. Even if you and another trader look at the exact same stock, on the same day, trading in the same direction, using the same strategy, you two will still end up with different entry and exits points. Both your sizings will be different. You two will have different risk tolerance and risk-to-reward. In the end, you two will likely end up with very different results.Â 

When other people try to copy your method, they will fail, because they cannot see what you see.

And for good reason. They havenât accumulated enough experience to see what you see.

You have thousands of hours of screen time watching price action play out on live trading session. When you look for entries, youâve trained yourself to look for little things here and there that other new traders simply cannot replicate due to inexperience. Even experienced and successful trader will have a hard time (but they most likely wonât because they understand the concept of finding what works for them).Â 

This is why finding your own trading strategy is key to being a consistently profitable trader.Â 

This is why when traders just try to find âeasy and fastâ method, they fail. Then they complain the system is rigged.Â 

This is why trading is hard and why it takes so long to start becoming profitable.Â 

But if you can grind through all the hard times, you will have learned the craft. Then maybe, if you keep up with the market, youâll be profitable.

Hope this helps :)

# Numbers:

**323** \- Previous breakout area / pivot area

**321.50** \- **321.70** \- High volume area in profile

**319.10** \- High volume area / Poor low

**315.96** \- 20 MA

&#x200B;

# Gameplan:

**323** will continue to be the pivot today. We'll look for the market to find acceptance above or below this area to determine where it goes next. On the chart above I drew a line at that **321.70** level. As you can see, this was a level of high volume in previous sessions and this is where the market ran into a wall. Where's the next level of high volume? It's at **319 - 319.10** \- the area of our poor low. The market always has a destination. What it does when it gets there is anyone's guess.

Should we find acceptance below **319.10**, the next destination would be the 20 MA at **315.96**. 

What about the bull case? Finding acceptance above **323** would be bullish. We have a large area of single prints starting around **323.60** and extending to **324.60**. The single prints end at **324.60** but the low volume traded extends until **325**. Should price reach this level, it's possible it moves fairly quickly through to the other side.

The Q's came into their 20 day MA yesterday. A long-awaited pullback from all-time highs. I'll be using the Q's as a market-leading indicator today for more downside action.

t3_hx0dyk,My Trading Systems- How I trade.,"How to analyse which stock to buy? You could use something simple like Moving Average Crossover or your system could be something very complex.

I generally use 5-7 setups when I trade.

The reason is, a lot of times I get false signals on one setup, but when I compare it with the Macro, when 3/5 systems give buy signal, I buy.

When 3/5 systems give me a sell signal, I sell. DISCLAIMER- I only trade in stocks, so some setups may not be available in Forex.

1. Price Action Trading.

I believe that price action alone is the single greatest system. The more indicators you use, the more messy your chart gets. For me, less is more.

I usually start buy drawing Support and Resistance zones /areas, the immediate zones and long term zones.

Then I plot Fibonacci Points. I love Fibs. This alone is enough to trade.


2. Heikin Ashi + Stochastic RSI.

The Heikin Ashi candlestick reduces noise and gives good signals. The rules are simple, if there are two continuous green closed candles, it's a buy signal and vice versa.

I usually add Stochastic RSI to improve the success rate, but the number of signals reduce.


3. Volume.

Volume precedes price. Volume can tell a lot of things about the strength of a trend. I also use a VMA, volume moving average.

I find out if the trend is backed by a volume or not. I look for divergences too.


4. Divergence.

There are two types of divergences, simple and hidden. I use RSI and/or MACD to find divergence. It's very reliable.

The drawback is that divergence works better in higher time frame.

I usually use 1D chart to plot divergence. Another thing, A divergence doesn't mean that the trend will change immediately.


5. Delivery % Analysis.

This isn't available for Forex. There's a whole type of analysis on this. It has nothing to do with charts. It's based on numbers.

I like to add numbers along with charts to improve my success rate.

There are a common scenarios and 4 hidden scenarios in this analysis.


6. Index Correlation.

If the index goes up 2% and the stock is correlated, and it goes up 4%, I can conclude using backtested data that the stock is dependent on the index.

If the index falls a bit, the stock will also fall, much more than the index.

Then there are stocks that have no correlation with the index, or inversely correlated.


7. Option Chain.

This is probably not available for Forex, I am still learning it. This is a VERY reliable system.

Mastering this will help with get 80-90% accuracy. It's pretty tough.

A single view can give you an entire picture of support and resistance zones and what's happening. Are new positions being created or hedged? 

Other Setups.

1. Moving Averages- 20 & 200 day EMA or the EMA channel. 
2. Sector Performance.
3. Bollinger Bands using channel.

I can talk deeply about all the systems with examples. But I've just tried to mention everything in brief.

* DO NOT dive right into the market , brokers like Webull and TD Ameritrade allow you to ""paper trade"" ( trade with fake money) in order to test strategies you learn before using real money.
* DO NOT underestimate the power of the indices and sector. The first process of picking the right investment or trade is finding the right sector. (Don't confuse trading with investing)
* Penny Stocks are great for trading momentum based off  volume and news for the day but do not focus solely on companies because they are inexpensive, they're cheap for a reason

So at market open I saw the volume spiked up and it was red as shown in this picture: https://imgur.com/a/mBcpjgx

When I saw the red volume i immediately sold my position from the day before. But it kept trending up and i realized that if i held on for literally like 20 minutes, i could have made a larger profit. 

My question is, is any kind of volume good? why did this trend up when clearly lot of people sold? What are some indicators to see if the increased volume will be good?

Again, I am still learning and I am open to any and every suggestions, advice or tips.

I have an account w/ money I don't mind losing in order to learn but wanted to establish a good trading set-up. I have an account with TDA and usually use the mobile ToS app to trade. 

However, I've done most of my learning of charting, price action, S/R levels, indicators, etc. on TradingView Pro+. I cannot stand using the PC version of ToS as the charts seem very unintuitive and clunky to me. I know it's the gold standard but I've never been able to get comfortable with it.

My question is this... is there a big drawback to using TV+ for the charts and then using the PC ToS' Active Trader in order to enter/exit trades? I'd have the TV chart open in a browser and then have ToS open next to it. Why I'm concerned with this is that there seems to be a lag between both apps in charting and I wasn't sure if there's some caveat I'm missing. Anyone else trade like this?

t3_hy6mpz,"Discrepancies in data indicators, depending on the source","I noticed that many indicators are different for the same stock / symbol depending where you look at.

For example for AYRO symbol:

\- Benzila Pro: Market cap 100.875âM , Insider ownership: 9.663â%

\- Questrade IQ Edge: Market cap 115.875âM

\- Finviz: Market cap 93.56âM, Insider Own: 1.60%

\- Bloomber: Market cap 100.87âM

Discrepancies in data in in 15-20M for \~100M market cap it is a lot. 8% difference in insider ownership it is a a lot. How one can possibly can do educated actions while investing or trading if information is so inaccurate.

Is there explanation why it is happen, and how to deal with it?

t3_hywf1i,Profitable Day Trading Strategy.,"When I first started trading I looked for the perfect strategy, 3 years have passed and I haven't found the ""holy grail"" strategy.

But I did find a pretty good one. One of the major problems beginners have is when should they buy or sell a stock? What do you EXACTLY do?


The Strategy:  Heikin Ashi + Stochastic RSI.


Heikin Ashi is a wonderful chart type that cuts major noise. It's a lot different than your regular candlestick charts. You get a series of green/red candles and the calculation is quite different.

Step 1. I look at the trend of the Major index.

I live in India, so I track Nifty50, you may track your country's index (Dow or something). I look for the trend and confirm the trend on multiple setups.

If the stock has positive correlation with the market, and the market is up, I look for buying opportunities.

If the market (index) is down, I look for shorting opportunities. The correlation with the market matters.

Some stocks have negative correlation i.e. The market goes up and the stock goes down. If the stock has positive correlation and the market is up, I usually avoid shorting.


Step 2. The Trend of the Stock.

You can use something as simple as the 50 or the 200 simple moving average to find the trend of the stock.

After that I draw a few support and Resistance zones on the chart. Not a lot, usually around 3,maybe 4 occasionally.


Step 3. Confirm the trend.

I use a 4x time frame chart to confirm the trend. For day trading I use 15 minute chart and I confirm the trend on a 1 hour chart.

For swing trading you can use 30 minute chart and confirm the trend on the 4 hour chart.

If the 15 min chart is bullish and the 4 hour chart is bearish, I avoid trading.


Step 4. Use Heikin Ashi.

The rules of heikin ashi are simple, two continuous closed red candles = bearish trend and two closed continuous green candles = bullish.

There are other rules regarding the size of the candle and the trend.


Step 5. Stochastic RSI.

I use the default setting usually, and if the RSI is below 30 and rising up, when the heikin ashi has closed two green candles, I buy. 

When the stochastic RSI is above 70, coming down, and there are two red candles on Heikin Ashi, I sell. 


Step 6. Entry. 

The 4th and the 5th point will give you the entry signal. I use a stop-loss above the high of the candle (previous) or some other way. 

The risk is always less than 2%, if my capital is 10,000 the risk per trade is less than 200 bucks. 

To find out the number of shares to buy you can watch my video on position sizing, or any other video on YouTube. 


Step 7. Exit. 

When the trend continues and I see an area of resistance (long trade) I exit my position.

Or when two continuous red candles are closed on Heikin Ashi. If the candles are red but the size is very small, I don't exit.

Exit= Major Support /Resistance or two continuous closed candles in the opposite direction with decent size.


Some Thoughts.


The Win Rate of this strategy is theoretically 80%, but in real trading it falls to 65-70% considering that your stop loss is hit.

That's still a good success rate. The risk reward is usually uncertain but it's above 1.5:1 (usually).

The more rules you add, the lesser opportunities you get.

If 2 rules out of the 7 rules are violated, or if a major rule is violated, I DON'T TRADE.

This definitely decreases the opportunities I get, but my win rate is higher and I am more confident with my trade.

You can modify the strategy according to what works for you. I learnt it from my mentor and made a couple of changes.

This may not work on every stock (no strategy does) and it is good in TRENDING MARKET. In a sideways market it either doesn't give signals or doesn't work.

t3_hzlrf8,Completely Destroyed,"First post, go easy on me. TLDR: I lost -$1500 and I don't know what to do.

What happened:

* I started about 2 months ago. I was doing ok. Then I lost -$200 because of a brokerage crashed.
* Paper traded. Watched a ton of videos -- **I think I should have quit here.**
* I got back in made +$20 in a week using ToS.
* Lost -$200 in the next two weeks. Kept watching videos adjusting, trying to learn.
* Made a comeback and was only down -$85 in total.
* Then I kept losing and losing.
* I tried to join one of those chats so that I could sell before the chat leader sold and make a tiny bit of the money back, but actually ended up losing about -$200 more -- **Bad idea to do this**
* I tried to go back to my original paper trading strategy and overall lost more.
* Then today I was up +$89 on KODK. Then I decided to buy more because I am still red so I am eager to make my money back... It all went down hill from there. I kept trying to make my money back -- **This was a huge mistake**

Now I am down -$1500. I tried to manage my risk the best I could. I tried to learn, buy at confirmation sell at validation, RSI, all that stuff, but more often than not when I buy the stock price just goes down. I am very sad, I cannot stop thinking how embarrassing this is and how I should have quit when it was only -$200. I know people have lost more but this is a lot of money to me and I feel so stupid.

EDIT: Sometimes I had my stop loss very close to the purchase price and I would get taken out quickly. So then I moved my stop loss more down and my loses became bigger :(

&#x200B;

â **Pre-Market Summary** â

Two headlines grabbed my attention yesterday:

# [Gold price hits record high on new fears for the economy](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/27/investing/gold-price-record-high/index.html)

# [Dollar index slides to 2-year low](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-index-slides-to-2-year-low-2020-07-27)

I can't help but suspect this is a zeitgeist moment; will these serve as a weathervane for what's to come?

S&P futures and European stocks slumped as market optimism faded during the busiest week of earnings season while Gold was hammered moments after the December future hit an all time high of $2000 following a record-breaking rally, with spot gold tanking more than $30 in minutes and silver dropping as much as 2% before regaining composure.

Gold hit a record high on Tuesday before the sheer scale of its gains drew a burst of profit-taking, with the volatility prompting the Shanghai Gold Exchange to issue a notice on risk prevention and express a willingness to take action if required. The dump in gold also helped the dollar rebound from two-year lows.

After rising almost $40 higher at one point to reach $1,980 an ounce, gold was hit by a wave of selling which it pushed back to $1,915 in volatile trade. Gold is still up over $125 in little more than a week as investors bet the Federal Reserve will reaffirm its accommodating policies at its meeting this week, and perhaps signal a tolerance for higher inflation in the long run.

""Fed officials have made clear that they will be making their forward guidance more dovish and outcome-based soon,"" wrote analysts at TD Securities. âThe chairman is likely to continue the process of prepping markets for changes when he speaks at his press conference.â One shift could be to average inflation targeting, which would see the Fed aim to push inflation above its 2% target to make up for years of under-shooting.

* The European Central Bank urges banks to hold off on returning capital to shareholders and show moderation in setting bonuses amid the coronavirus outbreak in a blow to some lender

â **Trade Of The Day** â

The game of musical chairs continues with large-cap tech stocks; eventually the music will stop playing and no seats will be found before prices drop, but until that event occurs, most of the market gains are coming from this sector.

Today's Trade of the Day comes via NVDA who does not report earnings until August 13th. [It's set up in a flag formation with a lot of potential energy, ready to break](https://i.imgur.com/QCgwuCk.png). And as we've seen lately, stocks are breaking BEFORE their earnings date.

Here are two potential plays:

1. What makes trading NVDA a challenge, like every other big-cap tech stock, is the price of $415/share. If you don't define a stop loss, then buying just ONE share at $415 represents the maximum 2% account risk for a $21k account! This is where fractional shares can come to the rescue for small accounts. I can define a fixed dollar amount in RH (or other brokers supporting fractional shares) and they will create a fractional share position equivalent to my investment. For example, if I wanted to create a [$40 NVDA position, then RH would grant me .096 shares of NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/hKtKSEA.png).
2. Alternatively, I could still leverage the gains/losses of a [100-share NVDA position](https://i.imgur.com/QjJHWkf.png) by trading a **vertical options spread using the 28AUG option series**, going **long the $415 call** and simultaneously **selling the $417.5 call** as ""insurance."" This trade *allows me to cap my risk at $125/contract*, which would represent a max 2% risk to a $6250 account.

# Gameplan:

We're headed into a 2-day fed meeting. In the past, this has been a recipe for low volume, choppy, sideways action, with a large emotional reaction at the end. I'll be watching volume closely and taking *reactive* trades at specific levels instead of *initiative* trades. 

For the bulls, they need to reclaim **323**. They broke above yesterday but did it in lackluster fashion. Low volume, no follow-through, and hardly closed above. Single prints start at **323.60**, price can move quickly through areas of single prints on the profile since it's usually low volume and lacks resistance. Simply put, it's not an area that sellers would likely step in. 

For the bears, anything below **323** is bearish. The first signpost on the way down would be **320.75** \- an area of high volume on the profile as well as yesterday's low. Below that is the poor low down at **319.10**. To repair it, we'll need to get to at least **318.90** or so. 

Fed announcement will be tomorrow and then AAPL, AMZN, and GOOGL report on Thursday. I expect these two things to be the major drivers for the next move in the market. During these events, volatility can spike and the market can reverse on a dime. But until then, it's likely to be quiet without and major movement in one direction. That means a breakout above **324.60** or below **319** is highly unlikely today.

We have seen some decent moves but overall trading has been fairly choppy during this period. I will continue being patient at the open, looking only for solid setups in this market. Good luck out there

t3_i04hhh,Price Action Trading- The Greatest System.,"When I first started trading, I used to add all indicators on my chart. MACD, RSI, super trend, ATR, ichimoku cloud, Bollinger Bands, everything!

My chart was pretty messy. I understood nothing and my analysis was pretty much just a gamble.

Nothing worked.


DISCLOSURE- I've written this article on another sub reddit, if you've already read it, you make skip this one and come back tomorrow. 



Then I learned price action trading. And things started to change. It seemed difficult and unreliable at first.

There's a saying in my country. ""Bhav Bhagwan Che"" it means ""Price Is GOD"".

That holds true in the market.

Amos Every indicator you see is based on price. RSI uses open/close price and so does moving average. MACD uses price.

Price is what matters the most.

Everything depends on the price, and then the indicators send a signal.

Price Action trading is trading based on Candlestick patterns and support and resistance. You don't use any indicators (SMA sometimes), use plot trend lines and support and resistance zones, maybe Fibs or Pivot points.

It is not 100% successful, but the win rate is quite high if you know how to analyse it correctly.


How To Learn Price Action Trading?

YouTube channels-
1. Trading with Rayner Teo.
2. Adam Khoo.
3. The Chart Guys.
4. The Trading Channel
(and some other channels including regional ones).


Books-
1. Technical Analysis Explained.
2. The trader's book of volume.
3. Trading price action trends.
4. Trading price action reversals.
5. Trading price actions ranges.
6. Naked forex.
7. Technical analysis of the financial markets.

I think this is enough information to help you get started.


Price Action trading includes a few parts. 

1. Candlestick patterns
You'll have to be able to spot a bullish engulfing or a bearish engulfing pattern. Or a doji or a morning star. 

2. Chart Patterns. 
The flag, wedge, channels or triangles. These are often quite helpful in chart analysis without using indicators. 

3. Support or Resistance. 
I've seen people draw 15 lines of support and resistance, this just makes your chart messy and you don't know where the price will take a support. 

You can also you the demand and supply zone concept if you're more comfortable with that. 

4. Volume. 
There's a quote ""Boule precedes price"". Volume analysis is a bit hard, but it's totally worth learning. Divergence is also a great concept. 

5. Multiple time frames. 
To confirm a trend or find the long term support or resistance, you can use a higher time frame. Plus, it is more reliable and divergence is way stronger on it. 


You can conclude everything to make a powerful system. Like if there's a divergence (price up volume down) and there's a major resistance on some upper level and a double top is formed, 

That's a very reliable strategy to go short. Combinations of various systems work very good imo. 



Does this mean that indicators are useless? 

No, I use moving averages and RSI quite frequently. Using price action and confirming it through indicators gives me a higher win rate.

I have searched around but I am honestly not too sure where to find this information or where to search for it. I know of level 2 quotes with the bid and asks, and have seen many fellow investors using the 'tape', as I believe it is named, on their trading. Is this essentially the only volume analysis method, or is there some other I am missing?

t3_i0u19m,How I Learnt Trading & Investing- My Journey.,"I often get asked about how I learnt investing at such a young age. I mentioned a brief overview of how I got into investing and learned the tactics. Hereâs the story.


The Idea.

I was 14 years old kid eager to make money. My mom gave me an idea of investing in stocks. It seemed to be practical but I knew nothing about it. Later I asked my mom and dad. They knew very little. I called my aunt who trades every day for the last decade. She told me stuff but it didnât help either.


The Hustle.

I started watching YouTube videos and read articles of investopedia. I understood nothing. It seemed like rocket science. I then bought a book called the intelligent investor.

This book was for pros. I couldnât read past a couple of pages. A month passed I was still on square one. I heard stuff like sensex, P/E, index, ROIC but I had no idea what they meant.

Next, I watched YouTube videos on particular terms. I watched a video on what sensex means. What was a stock. How it works. Watching animated videos were quite helpful. I knew something.

A few weeks passed I opened a virtual account on Stock trainer and traded a little. I watched CNBC everyday after I came home from school. Soon I knew the basic ticker symbols. And thatâs how I learnt investing, at least the basics.


The First Experience.

In August I had the basic knowledge about stocks through YouTube. But I had no idea how to open a demat account and all. My mom opened it under her name through Icici Bank. Finally, on 6th September I bought my first stock. Coal India x1.

I bought and sold random stocks. I mostly made losses. Over time I learned what fundamental analysis was. I watched animated videos on it.

I soon selected stocks on the basis of P/E ratio, profit and sales growth. It didnât work. I lost big on TATA Motors.

Then finally I read my first book on stocks. It was called Rule #1. I had to read it 2-3 times to understand. It took me a month to read it.

In August 2018, about a year later I saw a video on technical analysis. I never tried to understand it. I watched it. It was about 1.5hrs long. I was amazed to see how one can predict stock direction based on charts.

Over the course of a few months watched over a 100 videos on YouTube about tech analysis since then. I loved the concept of margin. I came home early after my exam and bought my first stock on leverage.


The Downfall.

It was Infibeam Avenue. I shorted it. I made more money in half an hour than I had made in the entire year.

I was soon addicted. Everyday after writing my exam paper I traded instead of studying for the next paper. Soon my exams were over. I had no time. I had to learn how to swing trade. I spent time analysing charts to figure out my next swing position.

Again I lost a ton of money. I knew I had to scale back. So I set aside a small capital for trading. April 2019, I opened an account on Zerodha as the Icici brokerage was too much.

Over the course I read books like- the intelligent Investor, Stock to riches, how to make money in stocks, how I made over 2 million dollars in the stock market and many more.

So videos and books helped me learn more about stock market more than anything. The simplest way to start is just fucking start. If youâve no idea what to do, just start. Search. Read. Thatâs how I learnt investing.


The Sharing.

In March of 2019 I decided to write a short blogÂ  on investing on a website called Quora. I was surprised to see the organic reach of my blog. Within hours I got over a thousand views. This encouraged me to write more. Over the course of a year, I ended up writing 450 short blogs on investing on Quora and a couple of books.

In July of 2019 I decided to write a book on my experiences. I brainstormed the ideas and after 72 hours of writing and editing, my first draft was ready. I had no idea on how to publish it. After a few more hours of research and designing the cover I finally published it.


After a few months I wasnât satisfied with my book. It was only written for beginners. I decided to write something detailed for people who have decent amount of experience in investing. So, 15 days and 400 pages later I finished writing it.

It did pretty good. I got over 5000 downloads. It's free (not trying to promote). 

The Pandemic.

The pandemic was a great opportunity to learn more. I'd been watching hundreds of YouTube videos (I got 1k+ offline vids lol).

And I learned more about deeper concepts. Like I'm currently learning about option chain and other forms of data analysis.


The Bottom Line.

At first I made a ton of silly mistakes. I lost money. But I kept learning and recently I started making profits consistently.

It's not a rags to riches story, but it's something most people will go through. I'm no guru or expert, I'm just a guy trying to document his journey.

""The more I learn, the most I realise how much I don't know"".

Guys, here is an idea; a real time textbook illustration of an ascending triangle consolidation in LiveRamp Holdings, so much so that I didnât have to draw the support, it was provided by the blue 50 MA. FYI they are a San Francisco based technology company that provide enterprise data connectivity platforms in the US, Europe and Asia.

Technically speaking this is a nice setup for the following reasons. 

\- Since the last jump in Late may, the price has been consistently bouncing off the 50MA support.

\- We have an oscillation of the price action where it's making higher lows each time.

\- The volume that is tapering off.

\- The 200 MA is just beginning to point up

Fundamentally speaking

\- The next earnings call is for Q1 2021 on 8/10 and theyâve beaten expectations the last four times.

\- Last rating on July 9 by Craig Hallum a buy with price target at $65

# Gameplan:

Waking up a nice gap down back into our 2-day balance area.

When you get long in the wrong place, the market will deal you a world of pain and that's exactly what's happening this morning. 

AMZN, AAPL, and GOOGL report after the bell today. Volume may be light again as institutional players sit on the sidelines waiting for more information. When this is the case, the path of least resistance is sideways to up.   

**Trade scenario:**

I expect many of yesterday's traders to panic and sell the open. Look to get short on a cross below the first minute low, with a stop above the highs. Should we continue in the southern direction, compare the volume with the past 3 days to see if there's an institutional commitment or just weak-handed liquidation.

I've only been trading for a couple of weeks with limited luck only making a few hundred here and there. I decided to really trust in the volume profile and have patience today and I've quit my day over $4K ahead in the ES mini futures.

t3_i13qc0,Trading is not gambling as well as poker,"I've added a comment in a thread that resulted in many downvotes (I want them back). People comparing trading and poker to rolling the die and I see many of you still don't get it why trading/poker are not gambling: risk management, strategies and statistics helping you winning in the long run.

You can't have risk management rolling a die (as far as I know - correct me if I'm wrong). You don't have a multiplicative factor like there is in poker or trading. You either win or lose. Your ""profit"" is 1*N where N is the times you get it right. And you will get it right 1/6 of the time. That's all the statistics you have to know about rolling a die. No strategy whatsoever. That's it.

At Poker (Hold'em), you have your starting hand. That starting hand has a probability of winning in the end of the round. E.g. if you have AA against 27 on pre-flop there's 88% chance of winning. And you have a **choice** (strategy). You can bet that you can win and continue the game after many events occur (flop, turn, river) and you choose to continue or not. Professionals will assess the current situation to know if it's time to bail or not because conditions changed. The 88% of winning is not correct anymore after you see the additional cards. They know that **in the long run** they will win 88% of the time but they also know how to manage their 12% chance of losing by betting or knowing the round. This my friends, this is **risk management**. If they think/know they are winning, they will try to increase multiplicative factor as maximum as they can to earn more. If they think/know they are losing, this multiplicative factor will be smaller. If they are sure they are losing, they will just simply accept the loss and bail out to not lose more. (You can search on YT many videos of professionals folding a pair of aces).

Let's bring this to trading: you can have a pair of aces (E.g. you buy a lot of shares in a dip of a strong trend with catalyst news) - that statistically will give you profit 90% of the time based on historical data (everyday stocks, fx, crypto whatever) **but** can flip around by a strong seller or anything alike so you have to sell it with a small loss or break even if you put your stop losses correctly. That's how you manage your risk. You **have** to do that in order to profit. Or you can have the 27 (E.g. buying a lot of shares in the top of a downtrend) - and continue holding it expecting it will go up again which can happen or most likely will not happen soon based on statistics. And no, thinking that ""oh, this stock has dipped enough, can't go lower"" is not a strategy or any type of risk management.

Bonus so you can question yourselves: do you think if Poker was pure gambling, a single person could win 15 times the World Series of Poker? (Google about Phil Hellmuth). Same for these huge Hedge Funds. Do you think they think trading is gambling with all those strategies and super complex algorithms and after so many decades of profit and so much money in their possession? (Bridgewater Associates - $124.70 billion AUM). I'm not here to judge the way they make that huge amount of money, but I am completely sure it's not gambling for them.",10,0.8200000000000001,1596182863,"[['AA', 1]]",AA,12.479999542236328,14.84000015258789
t3_i12mwf,ES Long - Higher highs 3280+,"Looking for higher highs this week and saw a nice pullback in today's ETH session happening right now. LVN at 3245.25 on the Weekly VP (red circle on the right), entered at 3250 after level was confirmed to hold. Stop placed at 3237.75, just inside the VAH, so if it breaks, the play is invalidated. I also have another limit order placed at 3232.75 to catch the LVN at 3230 (lowest red line), with a stop at 3227.75.

I would be surprised if we broke below 3230 again, just to test 3190 levels for the fourth time again this month. Argument begs: ""if 3190 is such a cheap price, why did we go that low 3 times?"".

Another bullish case is that we could dip down to 3215 to 3205 VAL zone, but id rather not choose death by a thousand cuts if we take a dump tomorrow. 

Edit: got stopped out, but the 3215 to 3205 mentioned in the above para worked out with +55points if i didnt cancel the limit order before bed. Note to self: dont be a pussy

I believe that were currently establishing value in this 3250-70 area, which happened to be last week's value area. If we do establish value here, we would have 2 'kind-of' P shape weekly profiles indicating higher highs. Looking for higher highs tomorrow since its been mostly a trending week.

t3_i1qdw4,My Most Glaring Mistakes,"Hey guys, 

I'm keeping a very detailed trading journal and thought I'd share  the mistakes that cost me the most money; some of them not only ate my profits of the day but singlehandedly pushed me into the red for the week. I had the opportunity to cap them all at my max risk/trade, yet I let emotions get the better of me. Maybe you can identify with a few of these and better your own trading by reminding yourself to respect a few simple rules. If you find yourself violating one of these, punish yourself by stepping away for the day; consequences have to hurt or you'll never enforce the rule.

I'm scalping so these mistakes are based on trades relying on TA on the 1-minute & 5-minute chart.

* Averaging down trying to salvage a losing position, thus making the loss exponentially larger (my biggest offender). Only add to winners, never to losers. To prevent myself from following this instinct, I made the rule that I can only buy dips when my slate is clean.
* Chasing breakouts instead of waiting for a significant dip; FOMO. When a stock is running without you, don't chase it but instead wait for a dip entry (ideally close to half/whole dollar support).
* Swinging for the fences when the chart is already extended af - take small wins and don't wait for trades to fully resolve (they'll likely dip the longer it takes)
* Not triggering my SL quick enough and then immediately entering a hope trade situation often combined with averaging down
* Tendency to be more afraid of realising a loss early in the day when I don't have a cushion yet --> can lead to real dumpster fires.
* Selling on the Ask in a precarious situation --> just sell on the Bid
* When a stock repeatedly tests the same level of resistance and you can sell for a profit, do it because it's unlikely that it'll break when it didn't before. Probably just a double/triple top.
* Unwillingness to sell for a few cents loss. Waiting desperately for breakeven or a small profit, thus risking a much larger loss.
* Buying highs on the 1-minute chart during a consolidation pattern on the 5-minute chart --> buy the dips and sell for small profits instead. Wait for breakout confirmation.
* Holding through consolidation during a downtrend on the 5-minute chart --> sell, it's more likely to drop further; hold through consolidation during an uptrend.
* Buying for a breakout on a shit setup on both the 1-minute and 5-minute chart (extended, following a doji etc.).
* Don't buy dips/short in the middle of nowhere. Always have a reasonble setup before you take a trade; i.e. close half/whole dollar support (long position) or close half/whole dollar resistance (short) or double tops/bottoms.
* Don't immediately trade after the bell rings unless there's a clear signal as to where the stock is headed. Automatic orders triggering in the first minute can cause an unpredictable drop that can lead to panic sells and even a circuit breaker halt going down. Yes, you could potentially miss out on large profits, but that doesn't justify the risk of taking exponentially larger losses.",335,0.99,1596279359,"[['TA', 1]]",TA,13.880000114440918,17.899999618530273
t3_i1kkle,Day trading on margin. How does it work???,"I have been day trading for some time in a cash account and I have been considering applying to upgrade to a margin account. Iâve been googling for the last few hours trying to find an answer to a specific margin question with a frustrating lack of resolution. Bear with me. 

Let me first start by saying that I know what margin is and I fully understand the PDT rule. The answer that I am looking for is not an explanation of what they mean (which is all I got from google). I am trying to understand the effect of my buying power after having already completed a day trade. 

I read somewhere that margin can cover all of my trade if, of course, I choose to use only margin and if I have the margin buying power to do so. Iâm not sure if this is true and if it isnât true, please someone let me know, but if it is true what is my buying power after my following example...

Hector is an active trader and he has an account with $25k cash and a 4:1 margin. So obviously $100k buying power. Hector buys 25 shares of ABC at $1,000 per share totaling $25,000 and he chooses to fund 100% of this purchase with margin. 30 minutes later he sells his position for $1,100 per share. A profit of $2,500. Later that day he spots another trade opportunity. What is his buying power for that second trade? Is it $75k because he already used $25k of his initial $100k buying power? Or is it still $100k because he didnât use any of his actual cash to fund the original trade?

t3_i2gonh,5DMA Scalping Strategy with Indicators for Thinkorswim,"*Update: I removed the color from the indicator.

The column and number still work perfectly well to show the distance between price and the 5 Daily SMA and can be sorted as originally posted. colorless version is below)*

Some days I am busy with other things and cannot sit in front of my computer to plan or wait for a complicated trade, but I still want to try to earn a little profit in a short amount of time.

One of my favorite ways is to find a quick scalp using the ""5 DMA"" (5 Simple Moving Average on the Daily ) on an intraday chart because it is one of the biggest support and resistance lines on a chart.

The reason why this SMA matters is because for a major trend to change on a daily timeframe, a stock has to first reclaim the 5 DMA as support, or lose into resistance, before it confronts the longer-period EMA or SMA's we more commonly use.

Because of this important event in a trend commitment, many stocks will bounce above and below this on an intraday chart and also set up for break outs when stocks are ready to make a change.

I have a pretty good strategy going but after my failed trades, I've noticed that 80% of them failed because they hit their stop loss AND the price went on to get to my take-profit limit either the same hour or the next day.

When I buy securities, I intend to sell them the same day but there are times when I'm wrong and it doesn't approach the price level I thought it would. It goes south, hits my stop loss and I move on. However, with so many of my trades _eventually_ getting to that point, it makes me wonder if I'm being too impatient.

I've seen ""huge"" swings in the ES futures and I've decided to ride it out. 9 times out of 10, I'm right because I just let the price go where it wanted and it eventually came back to my level. However, it's a bit unnerving to see $10K or more just floating around out there.

I understand it's irresponsible to not set stop losses but I'm to the point where I don't trust them. I've been burned many times and, through historical analysis, I've seen that if I would have just stayed in, it would have worked out.

Iâm from a banking/arbitrage trading/risk analysis family...would anyone be interested in information around those areas in regard to day-trading?

EDIT: 
Iâll have a bit of a write up tomorrow and stick it up here. Thinking Iâll post something on the arbitrage topic first as thatâs probably the most interesting/provocative.

EDIT2: 
Alright, here goes. 

Instead of an arbitrage specific write up I want to talk about something else firstâinspired by TheLoneComicâs comment. This is just what came out when I sat down to write. If itâs well received Iâll keep writing. This will probably be most beneficial to beginner traders with small capital and individuals struggling with stop losses...I can also go into more detail on this post, Iâm typing this up within the time frame I have. 

Arbitrage traders (also my background) donât think the world of day traders as individualsâor at least ALL the traders I know donât. Saying that, the trading world as a whole LOVE day-traders. The brokers do as they get commissions and everyone else does as 80-90% of you lose your money to the swirling pool of money in the market. This dislike or âlooking down the noseâ isnât all warranted, Iâll admit, but the trading world has to be filled with many losersâmany of whom, unfortunately, are just average Joes or Janes trying to free themselves from the wage-cage. This is a noble pursuit but most people shouldnât, or donât, require leverage to be profitable and are in fact endangering their capital by doing soânot to mention cutting their career short. This probably the most mind-boggling aspect of the typical day-trader. The term, âtrade within your meansâ springs to mind. 

The main point of contention within my arbitrage world is those hung up in the world of technical analysis and how reliable it actually is. Keep in mind these are firms with super-computers that execute and exit trades in the blink of an eye, searching all day across entire sectors for price disparity. Thereâs little room for human error and emotion...Arbitrage companies are incredibly profitable for this reason. 

I donât really want to get in a debate over TA as I know how emotionally invested people are in it. I do want to get beginners to rethink how they buy and sell. I will say this, broadly speaking, TA subscribers tend to mistake their success on patterns when the real winner is discipline and strategyâthatâs why I like to read this sub. if you donât have these you will lose...the same is true for all areas of business. We could easily transplant these people into any industry and Iâm sure theyâd thrive. 

I believe thereâs a missing link in the arsenal of the day-trader. Particularly for the beginner. And this missing link is combining Share Trading and CFD trading. This is a powerful stepping stone for those who want to wade into the rough ocean of CFD. Especially because it will help you better understand risk management and price movement. 

Iâd like to propose a strategy to the 80-90% of strugglers and losersânot the disciplined with sound strategy as they donât need much help. I believe this is a far better way to enter into the world of trading and will give you a better understanding of leverage and when/how to better utilise it. 

First, weâre going to start trading within our means, as protecting our capital is vital. Weâre going to do this by combining Share trading and CFD trading. Specifically, we need to look for markets wherein thereâs no restrictions on trading both CFD and buying shares outright. This means youâll also need a broker that allows you to do both. 

Next step is your strategy, PLEASE NOTE, youâre still going to develop your own strategy and work on your discipline so spend plenty of time on this...the only thing that is going to change is how you BUY/SELL. 

Donât mean to do this to you all but Iâll have to leave this one as a to be continued...Iâve run out of time and will continue later today should there still be interest.

EDIT 3:

Iâve got another short period here to continue on. 

I would like to share what I believe is the true value in leveraging for a day-trader and Iâll tie it in to where I left off. My algorithm will spit out roughly 20 strong trades a day across many different markets. Some of these trades will require being open for several days, weeks, or even a month (I know, this takes them outside the realm of a âday tradeâ). Herein lies a risk of capital being tied up in multiple long term holds and open positions. Two things here on why I like to actually use buying stocks as a DT strategy: brokers usually charge you a fee to leave a position open over multiple days...this cost adds upâespecially if like me you set a price target and donât exit a trade until it is hit. And secondly, clear stop loss positions are not always clear. So my solution was to just BUY shares of the stock, commodity, or ETFs if Iâd projected the trade to be longer than a day or if I couldnât find a solid stop-loss point (please note my average position size is $15,000-$20,000 per trade so I donât need the leverage to make money).

I could write a whole essay on hedging, as it can be very powerful when combined with this method correctly. Itâs roll to play is so important that I will have to divulge more at some point...maybe in a future post. 

I use leverage mostly to hedge and play some short game while Iâve got my longer term, bigger plays in the ground. Leverage is not a method I use for playing large positions for quick money. I think this is a far better attitude for beginners as the emphasis is always going to be on price targets and exit points, risk management, and money management/allocation. 

More to come.

EDIT 4:

To summarise my viewpoint, those seeking to enter the world of trading should first learn to share trade and hedge. Learn to walk before you run. Not only will you gain better experience, be more controlled and methodical, be less frustrated and have a lower chance of bottoming your account, youâll also have another weapon in your arsenal for when you decide to use leverage. Learning this skill will also allow you to understand when you can increase your stake/risk. 

Some parts of this have been left a bit vague due to either time constraints or they require a thread/discussion of their own for further explanation. If there is anything I need to dive into a bit deeper please let me know. Iâd like to post another thread on hedging and a âturning $1000 into $2000â play-by-play if such things are allowed? Also thinking about posting some of my algorithmâs picks, price entry, and price target. I like discussing such things but donât have a very wide circle outside of work to share with at the moment.",53,0.97,1596446638,"[['TA', 2], ['DT', 1]]",TA,13.989999771118164,17.690000534057617

Although price is following the trends along with support and resistance levels, thereâs a lot more happening beneath the surface.

Hereâs our cluster chart with time statistics. As you can see, the first high actually had more active selling than buyers despite price moving up. On the second high, there was more active buying than selling.

This potentially could indicate a change in overall sentiment of the market as it appears that more buyers are interested in these higher prices than before.

I will be watching to see if they can keep prices high or what their risk tolerance is in the case of a retrace.

The problem is, every platform I use (tried about 5) won't let me trade small stocks and the only one that does that I know of (speed trader) I think, you need to deposit 25k just to use it. I don't have 25k..

t3_i4c5lh,An Important Trading Lesson I learned from Gambling.,"Trading and Gambling often go hand in hand. They are different, but they share a lot of similarities. I spent some time doing a bit of research and I ended up with a pretty interesting conclusion. 

This is a long post and I am not going to talk about strategies on trading. i'll talk about something else which may or may not help you, but I find it very Interesting. Read this only if you have some time and want to learn something new.


**The 4 Types of People-**

1. Amateur traders.

2. Amateur Gamblers.

3. Professional Traders.

4. Professional Gamblers.

The first two types of people stand no chance making money long term. An amateur gambler is a person who plays cheap slot machines or someone who bets all his money on his lucky number 7 on a roulette table.

An amateur trader is someone who uses 10x leverage and buys a stock just because the stock is trading near its 52 week low price (Buy Low, Sell High. Stonks gang) without using a stop loss or any risk management whatsoever.

These people will not make money in the long run. But what about professionals?

A professional gambler or a trader uses proper risk management system and position sizing, and only bets when the odds are in his favour.


Letâs talk about **Roulette.** 

Roulette is one of the most popular casino games. Iâm using it as an example in this article. I wonât consider poker because I personally donât think that playing poker is gambling (If you play in ranges). Slots are for \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

The house has a 2.54% (UK) edge in Roulette and a 5.23% edge in American roulettes. Anyone with a little bit of experience can tell you to avoid American roulettes.


**There are 4 commonly used strategies when it comes to playing roulette-**

1. The Martingale System.

2. The Reverse Martingale System.

3. James Bond Strategy.

4. Fibonacci.

If you have no idea what any of these mean, you probably are better off not playing roulette. Out of these four the martingale system is probably the most famous one, but the major drawback is that you can go bankrupt really fast.

If you bet will 100 bucks, and there are 11 losing bets one after one (it is possible, I backtested the strategy in about 250 games), youâll lose **204,700 bucks.** 

The most favourable strategy is the James Bond Strategy. Letâs look deeper into it.


**Rules-** 

1. Bet 10 bucks on 0.

2. Bet 140 bucks on 19-36 range.

3. Bet 50 bucks on 13-18 range.

If your capital is 10,000 bucks, each trade will cost 200 bucks, which is perfect considering you shouldnât risk over 2% of your capital in a single trade. Thatâs a perfect risk management system. 

The winning probability of this system **is 67%,** which is astronomically high! You definitely have an edge in this system, right?

Not really. You definitely have an edge, but a casino is not so dumb to lose money. Even though you have an edge, you have an unfavourable risk reward ratio.

The average win in this system is 80 bucks, so you risk 200 bucks to win 80 bucks. Thatâs a 0**.4 Risk Reward Ratio.** Thatâs not good.

By Risking 200 bucks to make 80 bucks with a 67% win rate, you will end up losing money in the long run.

I played roulette 100 times with this strategy (computer algo) with 10,000 as capital and used the James Bond Strategy. I won 67 times, each time I won, I got 80 bucks profit but each time I lost, I lost 200 bucks.


**Here are the results-**

**My capital shrunk to 8870.** I lost 1130 bucks. Even though the odds were in my favour, I still lost 11.13% of my capital in 100 trades (bets).

This teaches a significant lesson about risk reward ratio. If the risk reward ratio isnât favourable, you WILL LOSE MONEY in the long run.

To improve the risk reward ratio youâll have to decrease the winning probability. You canât have a high probability and a good risk reward ratio in roulette. Thatâs why you lose.

But trading is different.

I ran the same system in MS Excel, the win rate was the same, 67% but the risk reward ratio was 1.5 instead of 0.4


**The Result-** 

**My capital expanded to 23,700.**

Thatâs 100%+ return over 100 trades with 67% win rate. A 67% win rate isnât very hard to achieve. Itâs fairly easy. With proper risk management & position sizing, and a good win rate along with a decent risk reward ratio, I ended up making a huge return.

If the risk reward was 2 instead of 1.5, my end capital would be 30,200. It may seem too good to be true, but itâs possible.

Theoretically, the success rate must go down if the risk reward increases, but in trading you can have a good risk reward along with a decent success rate. 


Of course, this wonât happen in a day. You probably canât find winning trades with 1.5 risk reward ratio daily, but even if you trade once every 2 trading days, youâll double your capital in a year.

âIf the odds are in your favour and the risk reward ratio is favourable, with proper risk management you can blindly take the trade. Youâll almost always win in the long runâ.

t3_i46fme,Anyone else focus on your win percentage above risk?,"I know it's stupid but I've been trying to closely monitor my trading behavior over the past weeks. I've found that I'm focusing on my win rate % over risk and it's something I need to work on.

For example, today, I'm currently in an intended scalp trade. My intent was to scalp a single tick from the ES Mini futures. It didn't go the way I intended so I just let it go thinking it'll come back. Well, needless to say, if I cover my short now I'm about $5K in the hole. I didn't have a stop because ""Oh, it'll come back. Give it time."" when, in reality, it's probably not.

I think to myself, ""If I cover my short now and take the loss, that'll look bad on my win rate"" rather than just cutting the loss and making another trade. I'm not quite sure how to change my mind into not worrying about win rate over risk management.

Most of the major producers and midtier names have rallied much higher already. The key is to find a name that is yet to participate in the upside. Take a look at $RGD Reunion Gold. It is a jr explorer based in Guyana, Suriname and French Guyana. Currently trading at a dirt cheap 13 cents CAD..

1)Barrick owns 20% of them, Dundee owns another 13+%, mgmt owns a bunch, so the stock is mostly held by institutional and insider investors which is a good sign.  Usually when a major producer like Barrick takes a large stake, they are willing to takeout the company at a premium when the environment is right (eg high gold price/ and/or explorer starts to hit solid veins)

2) it has had a large seller leaning on it lately, but they must be finished.
As we can tell by studying price and volume action. This will likely be confirmed mid-August with 13F holder filings.

3)RGD recently completed a private placement which got upsized (indicates high investor demand) it closes
Today. Shares are locked up for 4 months. Noone can sell new shares.

4)Earnings announcement is approaching soon, they revamped their website and are presenting at Beaver Creek gold conference in september. So it appears they are gearing up to sell their story and line themselves up for investor attention

5) no debt, cash balance to last a couple of years

6)ytd down 50%, meanwhile GTWO a next door neighbour is up over 200% since march

7) Broker price target is 95 cents!

combine all of these points and the current gold price
Environment, you get a major catchup trade. This could easily be 3-5X in the next few months.

Buy while its under the radar. It can be illiquid, so if u see stock available take advantage since the selling supply is now dried up. If any institution wants a decent sized position they will have to pay up to accumulate stock. As retail investors this is an ideal trade for us bc we can position ourseves appropriately.

t3_i3vavm,Summarizing some free trading idea resources I've been using,"I've been following many free resources on youtube and twitter to generate trading ideas. Some of them are suspicious; some are more like boasting their wining trades but never post any losing trades. I see many people ask about trading ideas/resources, so I want to briefly share some resources I find useful.

&#x200B;

**Twitter resources:**

1. @   TicTocTick

* Instrument: Mostly SPX/SPY/ES
* Technique: orderflow
* Highlights: TicTocTick is amazingly good at levels, spotting sellers and buyers levels. Everyday he posts his plan for the next day of the following format: If open above X,  long/short bias, target Y. If open below X, short/long bias, target Z.  Intraday he sometimes send ""warnings"" of potential big sellers / buyers at certain level. His price target and long/short bias is often right in my experience. His levels are useful for day trades IMHO.
* Notes: (1) even with his plan, one needs an actionable plan. (2)  He sometimes delete his tweets. His day-by-day and intraday tweets are more actionable than his longer term view.  (3) he sometimes tweets political and controversial non-stock related things.

* Style: holding for a few hours for SPX/SPY, swing trade for all

* Trading frequency: 1-2 trades per week.
* Highlights:  For SPX, he rode the big drop down in March; rode the rally up, and rode some pullbacks down in April. Got chopped in May. Now he's positinoning long.  He also did well in Gold and Silverthis month. He only uses candle sticks, support and resistance lines, trendlines, and sometimes true trend indicator. He doesn't use volume though.
* Youtube style: 2 videos every trading day: (1) live at 9am ET for 1-2 hours and talk about his plan and  market analysis.  Sometimes he trades during the live session (enter / exit).  (2) after market closes he summarizes the day, and talks about plans for the next day. (3) Every weekend he gives out his technical analysis for the next week.
* What I like:    His levels on the chart are very good.  He is also very transparent about his trades no matter whether it's winning or losing. He also explains the general economic environment.

* Instrument: All the stocks except penny stocks
* Style: day trade, swing trade options
* Timeframe: all time frames. Mostly 5min, 1H, 1D, 1W, 1M.
* Trading frequency: very frequent. multiple trades per day.
* Highlights:  Justin is very good at seeing through market maker manipulation and highly manipulated stocks. He often explained his plan and his outlook (especially in OPEX days) in his YouTube channel. The stocks on their weekly watchlist tend to do very well. He does live Q&A on youtube as well everyday where one can ask him to look at a chart.
* Youtube style:  Three videos by his team every trading day: (1) live at 9:30am ET; does 1-2 live scalping trades. Explains what he thinks of the market. (might discontinue)  (2) at noon: summarizes what happened and what he sees is happening later in the day. Some of his trading plans. (3) 4:15pm ET: summarizes today and looking forward to the rest of the week. Videos (1) and (2) include live Q&A. I've asked many questions on youtube. Every weekend has two videos talking about plans for the next week.
* What I like: The Q&A and Justin's outlook of the market, his team's stock pick.

Other notes:

1. The scalping trades in the morning is not very suitable for small accounts since they will trade  for example 100 shares  of BA (\~160) to scalp a few dollars per share.
2. Even though the stocks on their weekly watchlist does well very, one still need to come up with an actionable plan. Very often say they recommend stock A on Sunday, and on Monday it already gaps up big. They sometimes do YOLO options -- big risk big rewards-- options can go to 0.
3. Besides the free content, everyone can get a free one-week trial for their paid membership, or a 2-week free trial by winning a lottery game on their youtube ( what I did)  or knowing someone in their group and get a referral. What I like about the group:  (i) very frequently updates each day on SPY and stocks on the watchlist. (ii) all their positions, Profit / Loss are very transparent.

t3_i4tfnc,Was told by Broker that Stop Orders actually get sent to the Exchange by the Broker with a limit attached....is this correct?,"So to explain the situation.   I was trading AVCT and holding a position from pre-market transitioning into the open market.  I had set a ""STOP"" order to execute after the market open for $11.99 if the price didn't go the direction I hoped.  The price tanked and I ""thought"" I was stopped out.  Instead the second the STOP order should have executed, I get a pop up message and the order doesn't execute.  By the time I quickly dismiss the pop up (Before reading it) and try to manual stop out the stock halts.  The result is 7 times the loss I had prepared for when I placed the STOP order.

I called IBKR to ask what happen and here is what I was told.

According to the trade desk the STOP order was sent to Island (the exchange) but didn't execute because the price had dropped lower than the limit for the order.  I explained that this was a ""STOP"" order which should execute as a MARKET order, not a ""STOP LIMIT"" order.  He said that didn't matter because when IKBR send STOP orders to the Exchange they are sent with specific limits.  In this case, the ""Range"" for my STOP order was an order to sell between $11.98 and $11.78 and the stock had dropped below $11.78 before the order hit the exchange so did not execute.  I explained again that this was a STOP order which should have turned into a MARKET order and executed at whatever the price was, not within some arbitrary limit and he said, ""Yes but it doesn't exactly work that way"". He went on to tell me that per regulations, they have to send STOP orders this way because it was required by the exchanges.  

Can anyone tell me if this is true because no where at all can I find any reference to this in any discussion of how STOP orders are executed.  Every place says it should turn into a MARKET order once the stop price is triggered which means even if the price dropped below $11.78, it still show have triggered as some point. 

Note:  He also went on to explain that ""Regulations were subject to interpretation"" and that it is possible IBKR interprets the regulations very conservatively.

In any case, I am wondering if any can tell me what I was told is true of all brokers, that STOP orders have to be sent with limits to the exchanges or if he is just blowing smoke up my ass.

&#x200B;

1. The hourly bar closed three times above 3299.75, indicating some acceptance of the move up.
2. On the market delta, I pointed out two spots that showed active selling on the first test of resistance, then on the second test we actually saw more active buying. This was a significant change in sentiment.

I'm pretty new to technical analysis, and I've been on the wrong side of the trade for the past 2 weeks, so I want to figure out what I'm doing wrong. Added summaries in case you don't want to read through all the chart analyses.

Edit: Big catalyst tomorrow is job numbers and stimulus. Could cause big moves tomorrow so need to keep watch on that especially if you're buying before the numbers/news come out.

AMD: Advanced Micro Chips

Trend: Ridiculous uptrend

Daily: Printed a new ATH today but with a hangingman coupled with volume slowing down. Could be setting up for a pullback soon. MACD starting to flatten and RSI overbought. SOOOOO far away from 20EMA probably don't even need it as support since it probably won't even drop that low that fast unless it gap fills downwards.

4H: Hangingman in the morning, smaller hangingman in the afternoon with almost quarter of the volume. MACD almost flat, RSI overbought. Trendline of the lows suggests support around 83.30. 

30M: Already showing signs of weakness, with MACD and RSI trending downward, but closed the day on a slight uptick. May be a slight run up or flat for the next few days before pulling back.

Summary: Looks to be rearing up for a pullback possibly very soon. Put volume is increasing. Trendline support @ $83.30, more supports around $78.90 and $75.30. Resistance is at ATH $86.32. Sideways in AH. Entry at confirmation below today's low around $83.50. If you're feeling frisky, you can buy in ASAP  at open if it gaps down tomorrow at premarket, sell at first sign of reversal. 

&#x200B;

BA: Boeing

Trend: Downward trend

Daily: Closed above 20, 50EMA

4H: Printed a hangingman on low volume, but MACD and RSI look decent. Could pullback to 20EMA ($168.70) and continue up. 

30m: Printed hangingman, MACD flattening and RSI overbought.

Summary: May be a dip through the morning before continuing upwards. Resistance is $180.60, support around 170.20 and 164.80. Entry at anywhere above today's close($174.28) either from pullback or keeping above.

&#x200B;

ET: Energy Transfer

Trend: Downward trend for past 2 months popped after earnings. Earnings took a beating, but good outlook(?)

Daily: Closed slightly above 50EMA. Volume doubled. Slightly up in AH. RSI, MACD look great.

4H:  Printed a falling star candle. Could be a signal for a bigly run, but RSI and MACD are overextended. Could dip in the morning for an explosion upwards or gap up in the premarket/open then dump. Kind far from 20EMA and 200SMA is hanging above.

30m: Another falling star, RSI and MACD look great. Hugging 20EMA. Could gap up tomorrow then pullback to the 20EMA then settle down.

Summary: Ridiculous option volume and \~94% are calls according to barchart.com. Great candidate for a quick profit tomorrow morning. There are some resistances around $7.50, $8.30 and $9.40, ultimate target is daily 200SMA at $9.50. If it gaps up, entry at anywhere above today's close ($7.15). Watch close for reversal.

t3_i4ixug,"My AI Options Tool Watchlist | AAL, AAPL, NFLX, FSLY, WLL","Hey folks - long term lurker here. I developed a few tools last month and I have been testing their results by posting alerts in different groups. The tool here uses data analysis on top of options flow to make short term predictions (1-5) days about stocks. This can be really useful for day traders, hence this post here. There is no promotion, so don't worry. 

We've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.

The tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.

Bullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.

# Bullish Alerts

**$NFLX**  \- Bullish probability of 86.99%. This seems a really great setup for a  good bullish run. Recently touched the moving averages and staying above  them now ([https://i.imgur.com/92oNdFy.png](https://i.imgur.com/92oNdFy.png)). Expecting this to go up.

**$COST** \- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This might do a small pull back first. Get in on that ([https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png](https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png)). Getting in right away wouldn't be a great setup.

**$AAPL**  \- Bullish probability of 72.78%. Bullish triangle formed on 1 hour  chart. Careful with this setup if it drops because there is a gap.  Otherwise, this might run more upwards ([https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png](https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png)).

**$FSLY**  \- Bullish probability of 70.68%. I know this dropped hard today but  this stock respects the moving averages a lot. Get in on a dip,  preferably on the $102 level ([https://i.imgur.com/g0WnfMa.png](https://i.imgur.com/g0WnfMa.png))

# Bearish Alerts

**$FCX** \- Bearish probability of 91.97%. This is only a good setup if it falls down and crosses the support level at $13.6 ([https://i.imgur.com/Pxdbdt9.png](https://i.imgur.com/Pxdbdt9.png))

**$XOM** \- Bearish probability of 91.96%. This seems like a good setup, especially if it can stay below the $44.3 level ([https://i.imgur.com/O7RXKX7.png](https://i.imgur.com/O7RXKX7.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 91.67%. **Very very risky setup**.  After the news today, I would be careful. However, airlines have a  habit of going down after rallying for a day. The $13 level is very  important resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/d6XP1Bp.png](https://i.imgur.com/d6XP1Bp.png))

**$WLL** \- Bearish probability of 91.10%. Good setup if it breaks the $1.05 resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/jQXw9uw.png](https://i.imgur.com/jQXw9uw.png)

t3_i5mgv0,"DARK POOL TRADING STRATEGY!!!! Read It!!! jk, you dont have to if you dont want to...","Dark Pool Trading

PsychoTrader00

08/07/20

&#x200B;

As retail investors and traders, we are largely accustomed to participating in the major exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. However, about 20% to 40% of the transactions happen outside these major exchanges in platforms called Dark Pools. These are privately regulated exchanges that are not available to a retail investor. In existence there must be hundreds if not thousands of these âDark Poolsâ, some popular examples are Goldman Sachâs Sigma X, Citibankâs Citi Match, and Morgan Stanleyâs MS Pool. 

&#x200B;

When big institutions buy or sell an asset, they do it in large block orders. These orders can be anywhere from five to a couple hundred Million Dollars. If you went out on the normal trading floor with a $125MM order to buy Snapchat for example, thatâs 6.25MM shares at $20!!! It would be really difficult to get this order filled, either youâd drive the average price down substantially, it will probably take many days or even weeks to fill, and cause crazy speculation, to name a few. 

&#x200B;

In order to avoid these complications, âDark Poolsâ were invented. They allow for big blocks of shares to be traded without affecting the retail price on major exchanges. One key element that Dark Pools share between them, is the lack of transparency; they do not have a visible ledger like in the regular exchanges (where you press level II and see the order book). Only after the transaction has been filled, can the investors see the details. Important to mention that they will be very closely correlated or the same as the retail price.

&#x200B;

While the vast majority of traders are unaware of the existence of these dark pools; there are a handful of them that use this data as one of the pillars to their trading and investment strategies. At the very least, for most of us, it is a very good place for idea generation. The thesis is that if you can understand how the big hedge funds are behaving, then you can position yourself accordingly in order to profit. (Please make sure to do full due diligence before making a trade), so as the same with options, we not only look at Dark Pool Activity, its Unusual Dark Pool Activity!

&#x200B;

When we find a big transaction in the Dark Pool scanners, we need to build a picture of the sentiment of the transaction, meaning if it was bullish with high conviction from the buyer, or bearish with high conviction from the seller. Normally in an options flow we would use the bid and ask, but dark pool scanners donât show this information (at least that Iâm aware, please let me know in the comments if itâs different).

&#x200B;

In order to build the complete picture of the sentiment we need to couple this data with existing news, options flow, technical indicators and overall market trends. This will allow us to determine if the institutions are bullish or bearish, and therefore give us the context to place our trades.

&#x200B;

Lets use a real life example (Aug 7, 2020)

Two block orders for $28MM and $6.4MM came through for SNAP at around 3pm. I started to look at the options flow for the day and found that the general sentiment of the options bought at the ask or above were CALLS with the orders ranging from $10k to $50k in different strike prices and expiration dates. I interpreted this as general bullish sentiment in the options flow, and therefore assigned a bullish sentiment to the Dark Pool transaction in my analysis. Next, I looked at the news, what I found was Snapchat adding new features to make itself more a competition to TikTok, and Trumpâs war on Chinese apps, I took it than anything could happen. Finally, I looked at the chart (this is my favorite part) what I find is an overall bullish trend with a two week pullback which seems to have found a support (this is my interpretation), had a small gap down, rejection of lower prices, and now sideways consolidation for 3-4 days.

&#x200B;

My conclusion of all this, (this is just my opinion!!)â¦ Options are cheap cause IV is low (trading sideways), bullish sentiment in the options flow, bullish sentiment with the hedge funds, lots of news and movement, I am betting that the stock will move higher. Therefore, as a short-term trade I have bought the AUG 21 $22.5 CALLS @ $0.65 (this was near the end of the day when the stock traded downwards all day from a big jump in the open). Iâll be looking for a 50% to 100% on this. As long as it closes above $20 the play is valid. Letsâ go! (will post in the comments how it goes)

t3_i5jp2y,Trading psychology vs having an edge.,"Psychology is, in my opinion, talked about far too much in the world of daytrading. Is it an important part? Yes, but perhaps only about 10% of it. If you arenât executing your trading plan properly you are doomed to fail. However, if you donât have a statistical edge, you wonât make money! It doesnât matter how many times you âworkâ on your trading psychology. Edges are difficult to achieve! 

You need to be able to do the dirty work. You need to be able to spend time researching, backtesting (manual or automatic) and knowing the literature (mean reversion, PA, momentum) in order to be successful. A winning strategy requires an edge, but it also requires a reason for that edge to persist. In the case of price action, it canât just be a combination of indicators or else you might find yourself overfitting your strategy. Overfitting often reduces the lifespan of a trading strategy because market conditions change.

I think that mentors focus so much on trading psychology as a form of deflection from the most important part of trading, AN EDGE. Knowing your edge will give you confidence in executing your trades. Focus on finding one first, and then if you have trouble you can work on your psychology.

And finally, donât confuse hindsight bias with your psychology. Itâs really easy to trick yourself into believing, âoh I shouldnât have taken that trade because there was some support level there from a month ago.â Often there isnât a reason for a losing or winning trade other than the randomness of the markets. There doesnât have to be a reason for every time you lost a trade. No strategy is perfect, you just want it to make money in the long run.",36,0.9,1596826524,"[['AN', 1]]",AN,52.11000061035156,57.09000015258789

We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.

The tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.

Bullish     means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current      close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock  is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.

Bullish Alerts

**$ILMN**  \- Bullish probability of 88.43%. I know this dropped hard today but the  tool is bullish on it. If it starts to go back, it will be a good  setup. If it continues going down, don't get in. **Risky setup, careful!**

**$NVAX**  \- Bullish probability of 77.14%. I like that it dropped today. Either  get in if it touches the support at $160 and bounces back or get in on a  pull back at the moving averages ([https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png](https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png))

**$LULU** \- Bullish probability of 74.80%. Seems like a good setup, especially with a small pullback ([https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png](https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png))

**$FSLY** \- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This dropped right at its 50 MA. A good setup as long as the price stays above 50MA ([https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png](https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png)). Exit otherwise.

Bearish Alerts

**$BAC** \-  Bearish probability of 86.76%. I like it for a bearish setup if it can below the support of $25.2 ([https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png)).

**$ZNGA** \-  Bearish probability of 83.96%. This is at a very strong support level at $9.9. **Do not get in unless it breaks the support** ([https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png)).

**$GILD**  \-  Bearish probability of 82.68%. Might go up a bit before going down  further. Healthcare stocks are risky though so be careful.

**$WDC** \-  Bearish probability of 82.66%. Only a good setup if price stays below the support level of $37.8 ([https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png](https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png))

Trading for 3 months exactly. Started with 15k+ and have now grown the account to approx. 21k. I am a Master's level chemist and have almost finished law school. Currently working in biochem/pharma patents mostly.

I want to take a semester or more off law school to focus exclusively on trading; I think I see a path forward to success in this industry. However, 5k+ in 3 months is not even close to enough. When I started I was looking at the E\*Trade retail website not knowing anything, so I had to teach myself and lost money for about a month consistently before finally making some good trades and then losing more than before, so I guess most profits have come in the last 6 weeks approx.

I was looking at level 2 on an OTC stock today and I was surprised that all I could see are MM bids and asks. It appears different than level 2 on Nasdaq traded securities, making trades more opaque. Does this have to be the case or can I receive more information about level 2 in the OTC markets? Why is level 2 in the Nasdaq different? It seems like those bids and asks are those placed by retail investors.

I'm not opposed to investing and I think my background suits that, if had just invested in the pharma stocks I thought must go up I would have made 10's of thousands, but, you know, I literally knew nothing and was scared to lose all my money.

t3_i6djan,ALERT ON $INPX!!!!!!!! Tell us if you know anything!,"  **PSYCHO ALERT on $INPX!!!!!!!!**

On Friday after market hours, there was some unusual activity in the stock of Inpixon - $INPX. There were 2.4MM shares transacted and price rose 21.5% from closing at $1.39 to $1.69 in after hours. For context, this stock trades a volume of 6MM daily average in last 10 days. 

The next chart is from CNBC.com notice how there are spikes in the price after hours on Thursday Aug 7 and Friday Aug 8. This calls my attention, and I interpret like someone is buying these shares.

(Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INPX&tab=earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INPX&tab=earnings) snip taken at 5:57pm on 8/8/20)

Inpixon - $INPX is a technology company that offers location tracking and big data analytics to customers like malls, airports and government agencies for example. They are headquartered in Palo Alto California. Essentially this means that they help their customers with solutions for contact tracing that monitors crowd densities by tracking device. The CEO claims they could even color code and map areas (like a cruiseship) in order to take any action to enforce pandemic induced regulations (like cleaning, limiting amount of people, etcâ¦).

Before I begin with the good things I found, this company has had a couple of reverse splits with the latest on November 2019 in order to meet the minimum price requirements of the NASDAQ, in other words they almost got de-listed a couple of months ago. But they keep on plowing ahead with acquisitions and spendingâ¦ why???

In 2019 the company had a bunch of acquisition in order to become one of the best vertically integrated indoor solutions company in the market. The point of this is to become robust enough to attend the commercial but also the government sector. In the third quarter of 2019 revenue was up 63%.

On May 11 they announced Q1 2020 earnings. They reported a YoY Revenue growth of 32% in spite of the Pandemic. On March 11 they realized a partnership with Omniexperience to service a deal with Walt Disney. On April 15 announced a deal to service dozens of malls across Europe and Asia. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-reports-first-quarter-2020-200500382.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-reports-first-quarter-2020-200500382.html))

On June 8th the âReclaim Your Workspaceâ campaign was launched and on June 25th they announced a partnership with Lenovo whereby Lenovo acquired the rights to sell Inpixonâs âInpixon Workplace Readinessâ which are products and services aimed toward bringing people back to work safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The product will be pushed through Lenovoâs network of around 20,000 field technicians.

In a business update call on July 8, CEO Ali Nadir said âTo support these efforts (the sale of Workplace Readiness Products), we launched a nationwide Reclaim Your Workplace ad campaign, to expand our reach to key decision makers at Fortune 500 and other large enterprises and government agencies with a series of print and digital ads, online videos, radio spots and podcast sponsorships, resulting in an increase in our web traffic by more than 12x as compared to the periods prior to the campaign launch.â ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-ceo-provides-business-130000326.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-ceo-provides-business-130000326.html))

In the same update, he mentioned about a recent acquisition for an exclusive license of a statistical engineering software that will impact the top line by an addition of annual $3.5MM and also will improve the operations of their businessâ platforms.

On June 4, Inpixon - $INPX applied for a FCC ID. Basically this is an ID that the Federal Communication Committee has to issue to any electronic device that is connected. Now, on Friday Aug 8, they have been given an FCC ID. Check the Report Issue Date and Test Result. (this has not been PRâd) (source: [https://fccid.io/](https://fccid.io/))

They have posted 55 new job positions in the last week for everything from Implementation Manager, Software Developers, Senior Full Stack Developer, Java developer, People Relations Manager, and more. The locations are mainly California, Austin, Vancouver, and Toronto.

UBS Just bought around $4.7MM worth of shares, and GLA bought about $13.7MM

Their market cap is a mere $55MM and, as of June 30 2020 the company holds $39Million in cash and equivalents.

According to EarningsWhispers.com they report on Aug 19 After-Market bu also saw Aug 14 AMC. (Please if anybody can reafirm this).

According to Finviz.com the Short Float is 27%

I have sort of read online about rumors on lots of possible new deals with resorts, hotels, cruise companies, restaurants and government agencies, but was unable to find any proof or official release. However it really calls my attention as to why all of a sudden they have all these hiringâs going on in those particular places (Palo Alto, Vancouver and Toronto) I suspect those could be possible government awards?! I dunnoâ¦. Please leave a comment if you know something, especially if you can leave a link with proof. ð

All in all it seems there is a lot of activity and potential for very good news updates in the coming days. I would think that if they do not PR anything, at least they should on earnings which are a week away. I wouldnât be surprised to hear about new customers or deals, and the FCC ID approval.

t3_i6adb6,Why Beginners Should Avoid Leverage and Where to Direct Their Attention," 

The temptation to trade on margin can be quite overwhelming for beginners. Especially if you've entered into the trading world through watching others making huge gains. There are better places to direct one's energy in the journey to profitability.

The reason to avoid leverage is because, for small-cap investors, it's a near certain way to lose your capital and get completely frustrated with the trading experience. Put it this way, there are too many factors fighting against you in the market for you to be profitable as a beginner fresh off paper-trading--especially if you're only employing technical analysis as your strategy.

\[please note it is not impossible but it is *incredibly* rare\]

We should be asking ourselves why we want to expose beginners to significantly more risk whilst they only have the resources and knowledge of an elementary small-cap retail investor. We should be encouraging another journey that will teach all the lessons of live trading whilst reducing their risk. We wouldn't encourage a friend to search for a home to buy or rent outside their means, nor would we search for a vehicle that we couldn't afford to run...so why should we trade shares that we can't afford to buy? ""To make money!?"", you may retort...but think about this, there *is* a way to trade within our means that will make us money and will reduce our risk exponentially. Is it unreasonable to say, that our positions in the market should reflect our knowledge, skill, risk tolerance, and experience?

The *best place* for beginners to direct their energy is in *share trading.* The principles of Day Trading can still be applied through *Share Trading.* You can still develop your DT edge and strategy, you can still set market entry and exit points, you can still trade live. The primary difference being *significantly reduced risk.* If you treat it as if it was a CFD account you will increase the longevity of your trading journey--potentially all way to your trading goals. This method will aid in building solid risk management, *self-control,* and strategy implementation.

I am more than happy to explain in greater detail how these set ups would work and operate.

t3_i7frsa,I am frustrated and confused,"I've been generally paying attention to trading for going on a decade, and pretty actively engaged the past couple years...and really into it the past three months or so.  This will make no sense to some because on one hand I am risk averse and haven't really traded much at all...on the other, AAPL options are what I pay attention to the most.  Long call/put kinda stuff.  

I feel like I can read charts, deduce what the candles are saying, etc.  Generally, I'm more often right than wrong with my assumptions.  That's why I have been trying to ramp up with the goal of a good number of real money trades.

The thing is, it seems like every time I turn around, the complete opposite of what I believe should happen with my up/down predictions is actually what is happening.  Triple bottom?...I mean why wouldn't you go up?  Line of support that it would at least slow down on or slight bounce on any other day?...better go ahead and break right through that and bury you in your scalping call position in about two minutes. Break under support but then keep rising up the channel instead?...sure thing!  It feels like the market knows I am here and is screwing with me.  Clearly, that's a bad mindset I know.  

I'm not sure what the deal is.  The same things that have seemed relatively accurate in the past have just sh!t themselves lately.  Maybe it's because the entire market is basically drunk and trying to catch a cab before the hangover starts...a very big disconnect from reality is happening on Wall Street versus Main Street I know.  I'm glad it's only paper money, but honestly, it's getting very frustrating and turning me off to all of this.  

I'm not sure if I should blow this all up and start 100% from scratch or keep generally what I have learned and concentrate on maybe finding two particular setups and trading those rather than trying to work through them all as the day goes or what...

t3_i7co49,The World of Microcap Stocks,"**The World of Microcap Stocks**

When investors think of microcaps, they mistakenly assume the term refers to penny stocks. But thatâs not the case. There are fundamental differences between what we refer to as a microcap and a penny stock.

Strictly speaking, a microcap is a company with a market capitalization of under $500 Million. So in essence, you could have a penny stock that is a microcap as well. However, when traders say the term Penny Stocks, we actually refer to highly volatile, hyped up, speculative stocks whose shares are worth under $1.

Buying penny stocks is a lot more like gambling than investing, based more on hype and speculation than any sort of financial analysis or research. These companies usually donât meet the requirements to be listed on a major exchange, with bad sales, inferior products, and poor leadership. They are often unprofitable, illiquid, highly volatile, and exceptionally prone to hype and manipulation. The penny stock landscape is littered with companies that crashed and burned, taking their investorâs money with them. These stocks are attractive in the sense that since they are usually priced under $1, they make for very large returns even with an increment of a couple of cents in short periods of time. While it is possible to make money trading penny stocks, it is exceptionally difficult and has a lot to do with monitoring technicals, data, and news rather than understanding the fundamental of the companies.

There are however, good microcap stocks, which are a very different story. They are like penny stocks in that their cheap, usually with a stock price of under $10 and market caps below $500 million. But unlike penny stocks, these are companies with an innovative and successful business strategy and a plan of action to continue growth and create value for their investors. Good microcaps are small, well run, under-the-radar companies with fast-growing sales that could either grow to become a mid or large-cap or be bought out by a larger company. With these types of microcaps, it is possible to make higher returns without incurring the great risk of investing in an unstable penny stock. The challenge is finding these good companies amidst the sea of bad ones. 

In order to differentiate between microcaps and penny stocks, the company must meet a few criteria.

1. The company must have an innovative product or business strategy that will allow them to grow and accumulate market share. Every major company, from Apple ($AAPL) to Amazon ($AMZN) started off small but had an innovative product or strategy that allowed it to break through and grow. This product must be able to create huge sales growth for the company, showing not only demand for the product but also the companyâs ability to deliver on that demand. **Therefore, we are looking for small companies with a couple of consecutive quarters of sales growth.** 
2. The company must also have great value and clear potential upside. **Therefore, the second criterion is a company whose stock trades below their book value per share.** Book value represents the companyâs total assets minus its liabilities. If a companyâs market value is less than the total value of its net assets, the company is currently undervalued and has room to run.

The reason many good microcaps trade below their book value is because they tend to be ignored in favor of larger, more established companies. Even if a companyâs sales are going through the roof but too few people are covering the stock, the stock price will remain cheap. This gives way to develop an incredible advantage by allowing the retail investor to get in early and cheap. And when the rest of the market realizes the performance of the stock and invests, the stock price jumps.

As we can appreciate, there is a very big difference between what we normally refer to as a penny stock and other good microcap companies with huge potential upside.

Letâs use an example we have traded profitably in the past, iClick Interactive ($ICLK). Based in Hong Kong, ICLK provides online marketing services in China. We identified this company in early July when the stock was trading at $5.70 and sold recently at $8. Letâs take a look at ICLK using our criterion: 

ICLKâs proprietary technology platform claims to reach 98% of Chinaâs internet users. Their products include iAudience, which allows marketers to search, identify and customize their targeted audience to generate brand awareness, iAccess, which generates audience engagement for performance-driven campaigns, and iNsights, which monitors and measures marketing campaign results. With more than 650 million internet users in China already (anonymously) profiled on iClickâs platform, the company helps businesses find the right prospects and customers at the right moment. As the world becomes increasingly digitized, data-driven, online marketing will only continue to grow and ICLK is strategically poised to take advantage of this growth. **Since Q4 of 2018, ICLK has beaten consensus estimates in both revenue growth and EPS. This consistent growth quarter-on-quarter is exactly what we want to see.** While ICLKâs book value per share is slightly was slightly below its share price when we bought in, the quarter-on-quarter growth in revenue and earnings indicated ICLK had room to run, which it did.

t3_i7b8cw,Why would a successful Trader tell you patterns they look for?," 

I'm sure these questions get asked constantly, but guys like Tim Grittani and Dux both seem to be pretty mathematically/pattern based traders (as a math guy myself, this naturally attracts me).

Tim Grittani in particular seems to specifically say what patterns he looks to look for an actively trades. Why would he do this? From my understanding (which is probably flawed), in order to make money on the market he needs an edge. If for example, everyone understands the exit point that he is seeing, and also gets out of a stock, wouldn't that drastically hurt his value as well?

Is the market just so big it doesn't really matter? Is he just feeding BS? These guys seem to get to such a technical level that I have a hard time believing hes just feeding you BS. I know they're pushing products and courses for you to buy, so maybe they're just outsmarting you. Others say their pumpers and they're looking to benefit of their followers getting in on a trade.

A lot of this comes from my end goal of learning how to trade mostly using technical analysis, patterns, and purely numbers. A lot of HFT seems to be built specifically on that, so I know its possible. Lately I've been following all these 'pumpers' on twitter who are just following stocks and earnings and going through websites speculating on prices. That stuff interests me less as it seems a lot more subjective.",6,0.75,1597086370,"[['TWTR', 1]]",TWTR,36.709999084472656,38.459999084472656
t3_i7a9e8,"Margin Isn't Dangerous & Why I'd Still Use It If I Had Less Than $25,000","# Cash vs. Margin

&#x200B;

**TL;DR-** Use Margin if you're trading securities and either above or below 25k. If you know how to size positions, it won't matter if you move $4,000 into a trade or $4,000,000. As long as you sized the position correctly. If you're limited to 3 trades, then take 3 PERFECT trades:  [https://imgur.com/a/SpPOERQ](https://imgur.com/a/SpPOERQ)

&#x200B;

I see lots of people discussing contrasting ideas although they attempt to justify using both. Here are some things I see said and written frequently from people that doesn't add up for me:

&#x200B;

* ***""Use a cash account to avoid PDT""*** \- (Totally fine, in some cases such as certain options traders. Not if you're trading securities.)
* ***""Risk 1% of your account""*** \- (So if your account is at $25,500, I risk \~$255 and if I lose 2R I'm below PDT. Doesn't sound too great to me if I were to lose the first 2 straight trades.)
* ***""Margin is a double-edged sword""*** \- (It's only dangerous if you don't set hard stops or size your positions correctly.)
* ""**Never take on a trade that is worth more than your account""** \- (I can agree if you were swing trading but in terms of IntraDay trading, this is hindering your ability to grow your account. If you're risking $100 on a trade that costs less than your account value.. then $25 on a trade because of your account value.. then you're adding unneeded variables. Remember: ""Consistency."")

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The Predictive Model I built lays out all valid trades within the report range as well as \\""Perfect Trades\\"" that I consider \\""Textbook\\"".  The report range is between a 30 day range. Between 4-17-20 to 5-17-20. Total \\""Perfect Trade\\"" count is 9 trades. Even if I were limited to 3 trades per week. I'd be able to trade them with less than 25k on margin. The stats reflect $100 risk I've set on a different tab. \(The \\""W\\"" is just a graphic I made for \\""Winning\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/bvc575ndr7g51.png?width=2955&format=png&auto=webp&s=29f9ee90fe82d8844deedba838cd724469501ae6)

It doesnât matter if you move $4,000, $40,000, or $4,000,000 into a position. As long as youâre risking the same. Your **Trading Account's**  performance is based off of risk. Such as:

â¢Sharpe ratio

â¢RRR

â¢Number of Râs in 1 week/month/quarter. (Example: I made 7R this week. If my R is $100. I made $700)

# If I were to go back to when I was below $25,000 some years ago. I'd still use a margin account while being limited to 3 trades per week. Here's why:

`Formulas you have to know:`

`Position size formula = Risk Ã· Stop Size`

`Stop Size Formula = Entry - StopLoss`

# Example 1a:

**Stock ABC,**

*Entry* = $10.00

*StopLoss* = $9.90

*StopSize* = 10Â¢

*Risk* = $100

`In Live Trading: $100 Ã· $0.10 = 1000 Shares`

1,000 shares at $10.00 = **$10,000** position

# Example 1b:

**Stock XYZ,**

*Entry* = $385

*StopLoss* = $383.00

*StopSize* = $2.00

*Risk* = $100

`In Live Trading: $100 Ã· $2.00 = 50 Shares`

50 shares at $385 = **$19,250** position.

&#x200B;

\*$10,000 **CASH** account: CANNOT trade Stock XYZ and must wait 3 days for his entire account to settle after trading **Stock ABC.** If it was a margin account, they'd still be able to take 2 more trades this week.

\*$10,000 **MARGIN** account: CAN trade Stock XYZ and can trade both scenarios while still able to trade 1 more time in a 5 day rolling period.

&#x200B;

# Then the next point made is, ""Just won't trade anything above $20"".

&#x200B;

Ok. great rebuttal, but why? 

&#x200B;

Let's remember this: **StopSizes aren't always directly correlated to the price of a stock.** YES you're more likely to have a wider StopSize on a higher priced stock and a tighter StopSize on a lower priced stock. But remember this: **1Â¢** of slippage on **1,000 shares** is **10%** of his risk (**$10**)... It will be even more slippage if his stop loss market order is hit. Even a Sell-StopLimit order will have slippage within the amount you allow for when you enter a position.

**Stock XYZ** would have to be slipped 20Â¢ just to equate the amount of slippage on **Stock ABC**.Highly liquid and available stocks such as AAPL, AMD, NVDA etc don't have 20Â¢ spreads. Not even 10Â¢. Rarely 5Â¢. Most of the time. Just a couple cents. Of course there could be more right out of the open but the spread in my years of experience is tightened within 2 minutes of the open.

Yes, these small amounts in pennies do hold lots of merit if you're looking at having any longevity in this business, it WILL add up over the years.

&#x200B;

# Both trades have the same risk [in perfect world theory].

If both stop market orders were hit *(StopLoss)*. Both traders would exit with a $100 loss on each. Although 1 trade required **$10,000** in capital and the other trade required **$19,250** in capital.

Use margin. If I had to go back to when I had less than $25,000 in my account, I'd still do it the same way I did it with margin. I highly suggest using margin even if youâre limited to 3 trades per week. I get asked all the time when I began trading. If you watched my last video, I showed my first ever deposit with Scottrade (Old brokerage that was bought out by TDA a few years ago) in 2015 although I don't consider that's when I started trading because I didn't treat it the way I do today.

I really consider myself starting as a trader in 2017 when I:

â¢Wrote a business plan

â¢Understood statistics

â¢How to research.

All this being said, slowly over time I noticed that I am taking less and less trades  and increasing my risk size. Why?

**EV: Expected Value.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

`- Margin has zero negative effect if you're sizing your positions the same every time. Margin allows you to take on more expensive positions that are showing your edge.`

&#x200B;

**Bonus:** Being limited to 3 trades a week isn't fun, I remember that feeling from years ago. Just remember to take 3 perfect trades a week. Sometimes ""Perfect Trades"" don't work out in your favor while some subpar situations hit target. Some weeks you might take your 3 ""Perfect Trades"" by Tuesday. Some weeks you might take only 1 ""perfect trade"". If you follow my watchlists on Twitter (Same handle as my Reddit), I keep my Day Trading Buying Power transparent. Not always is it growing perfectly linear. And not always am I posting every single day because sometimes, my edge isn't there. Just because the market is open doesn't mean you HAVE to trade.

My watchlists aren't littered with 15+ tickers. Rarely do they have more than 7. That may work for other traders, but for me, I demand quality. It's either there or it isn't. No reason to force a trade. I'd rather focus heavily on a few tickers rather than spread myself thin across multiple.

Trading isn't supposed to be exhilarating or an adrenaline rush. It can be boring. I said that in the post I wrote back in April.

Also if you make money, even if its just $20 in a month. Take that money out and buy something. Shrine it. Cherish it. You ripped that money out of WallStreet. Be proud of it. It takes a lot of courage to do this business. Realize that the P/L is real money. Sometimes even just buying a tank of gas or a book will help you realize that. Spend it from time to time. Get something out of your trading account. You may or not be trading for long, get something that is tangible to always remember the experience in case you don't last. Make it your trophy.

&#x200B;

That's all I've got for right now. Maybe I'll make another post or 2 before the year ends. I hit my 1 year full-time mark in September.

Best wishes!

t3_i77z4d,ð$NIO DDð,"DD: WHY NIO WILL BE $20+

NIO's recent rally gained a lot of attention as the stock jumped from a stable price of $3 to $10+ and is now beginning to stabilize, but there is so much more room for the stock to grow, as NIO is likely to be the true CHINESE TESLA.

To understand why NIO will rally in the future, it is important to understand NIO's history and rationale for the current rally. NIO was once $5+ but fell back down over a year ago to a low of $1.5, because of three key reasons:

1. NIO's early cars (ES8's) had a recall due to reports of battery fires. This key failure last year caused the stock price to dip a large amount very early.
2. NIO was having liquidity issues burning through large amounts of cash very fast, and many investors feared the company may go bankrupt before turning a profit unless more cash was injected into the company.
3. Investors feared delisting of Chinese stocks due to Trump / China tensions, causing many investors to pull out of Chinese stocks, creating bearish sentiment.

After NIO's Q1 2020 earning calls, the stock fell 5% but the earnings call had valuable information which cleared NIO to run upwards. NIO received a cash injection of $1 billion from several state-owned companies, giving it much more runaway before bankruptcy. Furthermore, NIO's sales projections had shown that buyers no longer feared battery fires/explosions and sales were beginning to rise. While January / February / March sales had deliveries of 1000 cars / month, April sales were at 3000 cars, proving that they were starting to rise in demand. All of this good news caused the stock price to practically triple over the course of three months and now stabilize leading us to now.

Now that we have an understanding of the past, we can now move as to why NIO will grow extremely fast from this point onward. Here are the key reasons why NIO will moon in the future:

1. **NIO is the ONLY luxury car company able to have sales similar to other EV carmakers in China.** Chinese car companies are known more for their reliability and a domestic luxury car retailer has never achieved the success that NIO has had (think toyota, honda, etc.). NIO's car sales of 3000 cars / month and consistently beating projections is proof that NIO's cars are extremely desirable and has potential to be a large scale brand. Every NIO car is $60,000+ USD, which is significantly higher to other EV carmakers in China. NIO's most recent car was the 4th best selling EV car in China.
2. NIO's positioned itself with 2 key ways of uniquely standing out. First, NIO cars have a 3 minute battery swap, meaning that you can carry a spare battery in your car and swap it out with the current battery in 3 minutes. Furthermore, if your car ever dies, you can call NIO and they will personally drive their own charging van to you an charge your car. **The battery swap aspect is a part of NIO that is not even an advantage of owning a TESLA vehicle.** Furthermore, NIO's charging stations are positioned as a lifestyle place with cafe's, a place to work, meaning that charging gives people things to do. While a small advantage, setting up a great charging ecosystem will make more people willing to buy NIO cars specifically.
3. NIO has begun pre-production of their new EC6 vehicle which is set to release in September in direct competition with the TESLA Model Y. **The fact that NIO will have 3 cars in their lineup gives consumers diverse options and this model will be in a slightly lower price range, giving more people the ability to afford it.** Sales of this car have the potential to sky-rocket with the recovering pandemic situation, as NIO has positioned its cars as a sign of status / luxury.
4. NIO has gone through a phase where there is already much brand awareness of the cars around China. **They have 150+ showrooms throughout the country and have solved all of their issues, giving it room to rocket with increasing sales over these next few quarters.** All NIO has left to do is sell cars, which will naturally increase as people begin to look into buying cars post pandemic. Furthermore, NIO cars are EV vehicles and with stricter regulations / encouragement to switch to electric cars, people will naturally turn to NIO for cars in the future. **Furthermore, NIO is looking to expand internationally into Europe and the US, and already has offices there as well.** With this expansion, we can see a dramatic increase of sales in the future.
5. NIO has the backing of the CCP. They have been giving funding since the beginning by the government in an effort to produce a local EV vehicle. **With the battle of international brand such as TESLA, the CCP will want a domestic brand to win this battle and won't mind giving more funding in the future given positive results.**

TLDR: Essentially, while NIO may have just gone through a huge run up, there is huge upside potential within the next 6-12 months. Any good news will make the stock go up and cause another run up. NIO has conquered all its issues in this first half of 2020 and is now just looking to grow. **It has the potential to 2x over the course of the next 6-12 months!**

t3_i70vvh,ES Short 3355 -> 3310,"Looking at a short for Monday's session down to atleast 3325, possibly further to 3310 area. If you look at the monthly VP, it took 1 trading day to form the lower distribution's POC of the 3 distributions on the chart. It took 2 trading days to form the middle one, and it took 3 trading days to form the top one, and yet the top one has the smallest amount of volume traded at. This seems to indicate that prices are too high too continue the uptrend. Further, this distribution is not a P-shape distribution to indicate a further move up this week. I expect a short down of atleast 25-40+ pts before anticipating a further move up. I'm short from 3350, very conservative target of 3332 given not enough other VP confluence to take the trade down to 3310 myself.

The tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.

Bullish  means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current       close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock   is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.

# Bullish Alerts

**$BABA**  \- Bullish probability of 84.3%. This fell right at the 50 moving  average which usually acts as a support for a stock in uptrend ([https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png)).

**$CHWY**  \- Bullish probability of 75.1%. Again, a beautiful setup especially if  it falls on the support at $52 and starts to bounce back ([https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png](https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png))

**$MSFT** \- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.

**$TWLO**  \- Bullish probability of 67.2%. This is only a decent setup if it stays  above the support of $245. Bad setup otherwise. However, the tool is  bullish, so I have got to go with that. ([https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png))

# Bearish Alerts

**$SPCE**  \- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a  week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can  break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**  with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it  breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance  level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))

**$SRNE**  \- Bearish probability of 86.9%. This is the third alert from the tool  and I've failed twice with this alert. So I would encourage you not to  follow this. But I trust the tool and I think this is going to get down  at some time.

**$JPM** \- Bearish probability of 85.3%. This is a good setup if it touches the resistance and comes back from $99.7 level ([https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png](https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png))

If the airline stocks set up, I will trade them but my main focus will remain on earnings plays. Markets up 11 days in a row, we may see some profit taking soon, something to keep in mind. Good luck trading

t3_i84qbh,Strategy to Get out of this $V Play with as small of a loss as possible.,"Hey All, Looking for some advice/guidance here on a scenario I am currently in. I've been having a great past two months and got a little cocky and strayed away from some of my rules. The rule I broke was not to open calls/puts without having a day trade available to get out, I am currently under PDT. 

I really liked $V to breakout of it's range today into tomorrow for a bigger move so I bought 4 Aug 21 $V $205 calls and 1 Sep 4 $V $210 call. It actually worked well and I was up for a good part of the day until $SPY tanked. By the time I saw $SPY tanking all I saw was red so I bought 5 Aug 21 $V $190 Puts to offset the beating my calls were taking. I wasn't able to fully hedge my position as I bought the Puts a bit late. 

&#x200B;

|Call/Put Play |Quantity/Mkt Value|Last/Avg Price|Unrlzd P&L |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|V $190 - 21 Aug 20 PUT |5 puts  - $602.50|$1.21 / $0.84|\+$184.50     +44.14%|
|V $210 - 04 Sep 20 CALL|1 Call - $134.00|$1.34 / $2.35|\-$101.00     -42.98%|
|V $205 - 21 Aug 20 CALL|4 Calls - $454.00|$1.14 / $2.03|  \-356.00        -43.95% |

&#x200B;

I am not even sure this was a good strategy to begin with buying the puts but I saw it tanking and just reacted. 

Obviously this is a lesson learned and I will stick to my rules so I can get back to the success I had been enjoying prior. 

That being said what are some strategies you all would use to get out of this play with minimal damage? Should I wait to see the trend and then cut the Calls/Puts that are trending in the wrong direction? Should I hold the puts as they were cheaper and just hope my calls gains ultimately offset the cost of the Puts? Any advice would be welcome, just trying to get better here. 

TL;DR bought calls without day trades, bought puts to offset losses. how do I escape as safe as possible?",2,1.0,1597196259,"[['V', 5]]",V,198.24000549316406,202.83999633789062

Trust me when I say Iâve paid for my education I mean like a semester of college worth but Iâve made it all back and then some. Recently Iâve been using a very simple strategy that is a combination of Guppy MMA and elders triple screen 

The time frames I use are 2hr, 30 min, and 5 min

On the 2 hr I have the guppy (3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15 periods. The longer-term MAs are set at 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 60). and MACD. On this screen I confirm the daily trend with the short term and long term MA and I have the MACD as a 3rd confirmation. I also look to see if we are near a line of support or resistance as you donât want to go long at resistance and short at support. 

On the 30 min I have the guppy and RSI. I look any signals of a pullback from the RSI and confirm the 30 min trend is inline with the 2hr

If both these are true I time my entry on the 5 min using price action and the MACD with impulse candles. I look for an entry on a blue candle or green and will hold and look for a better entry if red.

**333.50** \- Previous breakout area

# Gameplan:

It's a summer Friday and traders should be aware of what a summer Friday market looks like. It looks like normal in the morning and then volume dries up in the afternoon. I don't like to take *initiative* trades in low volume, only *reactionary*. Let's look at a couple of scenarios:

1.) We shoot up right out of the gate, breaking through **338.25** and reach all-time highs before noon. In this scenario, I'm *not* shorting the highs. The fact of the matter is we've hung out below the highs for 3 days now, the moving average are catching up, and this sort of action isn't indicative of a turnaround, it's indicative of higher prices. That being said, I wouldn't go long at the all-time highs either as we're sitting at the top of our channel. 

2.) Say we stay below **338.25** before noon and in the afternoon we jam it through and get to all-time highs. Given this is a Friday afternoon and *likely* to have low volume, I would *probably* be willing to get short here as breakouts can't sustain themselves without volume. 

What happens if we start going lower? 

The numbers I posted should act as near term support, however, the stronger supportive levels come in at **330** and the 20 Day MA at **328.21**. 

We have a weekly candle that will close today and if the bulls want to look good on the chart, they'll close it at least as high as we are now. The week opened at **335** and has a low of **332**. Keep it in the back of your mind.

I have a post that I explained how in etoro you donât own the stock what so ever but u just own a cfd contract even if you donât use margin 

In this post Iâll explain a little bit about how etoro pays dividends on your stocks even tho you donât own them and the dangers of trading on this kind of brokers 

ââââââââââââââââââââ


As I said in one of my replay , the underlying asset is a cfd contract (cfd contracts are decaying assets ) , a cfd contract doesnât grant you any ownership over the real stock. Let me explain again .

In one of the legit brokers I use , they have this program that if you subscribe in , you give the broker the permission to lend the stocks in your portfolio to other traders who want to short sell the stock , like I have 5 apple stocks in my portfolio, if Iâm signed up to the lending programme in this legit broker , then they can take my 5 apple stocks and lend them to someone who wants to short sell them .

1 - by law Iâm not paid dividends on those stocks that they borrowed from me , but the borrower is paid the dividend cause he is the owner now as long as he is borrowing my stocks .

2- said broker will pay me 50% of the interest that he charges the short seller

3- the broker will still give me my dividends equivalent but in a form of capital gain ( etoro does pay u dividends equivalent from the commission that he charges on his platform , but not real dividends, )

This might sound complicated but again this is way a broker like etoro can tell their clients that they are buying the asset which in-fact they are not , it is legal but it is a form of word play , the real danger is if etoro goes bankrupt or for any reason doesnât wna does his part of cfd contract deal then they tottaly can , they donât do it upfront , but they can halt trading on a certain stock , just an example , a real legit broker will never halt trading on a stock unless the exchange itself halt trading and no one in the world can buy the stock , in etoro you will find that you canât sell a certain position or open one , while at the same time other traders on other platforms are happily buying the same stock and selling it , this is one form of etoro saying â I donât want to keep up to my words that and exercise the cfd contract â

Somethings I said are a bit complicated but etoro banks on the low experience and innocency of their clients .



They actually blocked a popular investor called âharshsmithâ because he was allegedly scalping stocks , and he have 2k copiers , so every 1000$ he made is 2 million $ that etoro had to pay to all his copiers , they might not allow scalping and thatâs their law but keep in mind , if they are a legit broker they would be happily letting him scalp cause he and his 2k copiers are paying commission, and commission is how they make their profit as they say (big lie , they make it from your losses ) , then why block and profitable popular investor with a lot of copiers paying commission? Cause they are paying him his profit from their pocket and not the real market , I donât mind them having their own non scalping law , but why have it if your legit ?! More scalping is more commission for the broker right ? Unless it is not a legit broker such as etoro

* Only go **long** if: price breaking up from VWAP w/ 200EMA uptrending
* Only go **short** if: price breaking below VWAP w/ 200EMA downtrending
* Stop loss will usually be just on the other side of VWAP, reward will usually be set at 2-3x that... depending on where long-term S/R zones are

That's all there is to it. I've gotten carried away many times by adding too many details here and there. Decided to keep it as simple as possible for now.

Stocks were mostly higher on Monday, with the S&P500 and NASDAQ up 0.27% and 1% respectively. The S&P is once again closing in on its February record. The Dow opened modestly lower, down 0.31%.

Gold is one the rise again, after Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B) reported they added a $562 million position in gold miner Barrick Gold ($GOLD). Shares of $GOLD rallied 10% after the announcement. While Buffet, who is known as the âOracle of Omahaâ, has criticized investing in gold in the past, his purchase of $GOLD and recent sale of bank stocks might indicate the legendary investor is changing his tune. Barrick Gold is now the 11th largest holding in Berkshireâs portfolio. 

Tension between the US and China flared over the weekend after a meeting regarding the terms of their Phase 1 trade deal was pushed back, according to CNBC and Bloomberg. The discussions, which were set to involve a video conference call between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are reportedly now delayed indefinitely.

Elsewhere in politics, the Democratic National Convention kicks off this week as a predominantly virtual event, during which former Vice President Joe Biden is set to accept the presidential nomination alongside his recently announced running mate Sen. Kamala Harris.

Lawmakers in Washington were expected to remain in recess until mid-September, This means no negotiations regarding the passage of more fiscal stimulus taking place during that break. The prospects for near-term stimulus are looking grim.

However, Representative Nancy Pelosi has urged lawmakers to call The House back into session in order to deal with the crisis of the USPS funding, which has put in risk the possibility of a mail in election. 

Goldman Sachs analysts last week said they saw room for the S&P 500 to rally to 3,600 amid faster US economic growth and vaccine prospects. And Fundstratâs head of research Tom Lee last week raised his price target on the S&P 500 by 75 points to 3,525, reflecting the potential for âreopeningâ stocks hardest hit by the pandemic to catch up with the rally seen in other sectors over the past few months.

Highlights 

* The 10-year Treasury yield (\^TNX) retreated below 70 basis points after breaking above that level for the first time in over a month.
* The price of gold is close to breaking above $2000 again ($1983 at the time of writing).

t3_icro65,Simple daytrading and swing strategy,"I wanted to share my most profitable strategy, one that happens about 2-3 times a week, and that can be used for both daytrading as well as swing trading because it identifies the stocks that are ripe for long term breakouts and provides the best entry point.

The filter:
I simply scan for stocks that are above their 50 day MA and that today have crossed or touched their 200MA.
Next I analyze those candidates to find other pivots. The stock should also be just below a major resistance point. These then go on my longs watchlist. 

[See example](https://imgur.com/a/VBSc88X) (Ignore the last bar of the chart, that's today's trade.)

The trade:
I watch for these stocks to open above or just under their major resistance areas. To enter a trade I look for an opening doji trigger. Meaning I look for any of my long candidates to make a doji as their first candle of the day at the 2, 3, 5, or 15 minute time frames, (it doesn't have to be a perfect doji, but it should be a very small body candle) if the next candle closes above the doji this is the confirmation, I enter at the next candle as long as its not dipping into the doji's range. My stoploss is at the doji's open.

[See example](https://imgur.com/wQcvalT)

Preferably there should be above average volume at the confirmation candle.

Let me know if any questions!

**Edit:** 

Target: For a swing trade I use the previous trading range as my target. For intraday trading my 1st target is 3R for half, then I trail the rest.

Scanner: I use a simple custom scanner in TOS. See [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/PjlpY5X) for how's set up

Guys, always do your own backtesting before trying any strategy. You will learn the most if you look at the top gainers of the day, find the ones that gained throughout the day (Not just gapped up and stayed flat), and see what patterns you find. You will see this opening-range strategy is quite common among these, the difficult part is to be prepared for them, so it's best to focus on only a few candidates, this is where the filter comes into play, but looking at pre-market movers will also give you good candidates.

**Edit 2:** I have been asked a few good questions which i feel are important to add 

Why does this only work with a doji?

I'm not saying it only works with a doji, I just like to use the doji for this strategy because I have noticed it work best with the doji open, perhaps with more study I will find ways to trade the strategy with other types of candles.

Why does the doji work?

Dojis mean the movement of the stock has not changed much despite thousands of transactions, they represent a tug-o-war between buyers and sellers. The way to tell which side has most likely won is with the breakout above the high or below the low of the doji. and like a tug-of-war, the winning side will have a lot of momentum when the other side lets go.

 Of course the only caviat, sometimes the breakout is not real, it's just a bigger doji, meaning that what was a 2 min doji can become a 15 minute doji with bigger high/lows (this almost always points to a ranging day).

Why are you sharing this?

First because it's useful, second because I hope some of you will come back with some tweaks and improvements to this strategy.",332,0.98,1597856664,"[['MA', 1]]",MA,330.19000244140625,358.0

**337.30** \- Bottom of shorter-term trendline

&#x200B;

# Gameplan:

We have to be asking ourselves.. what does the future hold for the markets? Well based on yesterday's action, it's telling us that higher prices are in the cards. Did we have a reaction at the all-time highs? Yes we did, though it was a blip on the radar. Nothing to write home about, especially when we closed just under the highs. The overnight session went well into all-time highs making a high of **339.50**.

We simply can't argue with a market that only wants to go higher. The trend is your friend, and the trend is strong. With interest rates so low, the bond markets are garbage, and the best place for money to go is the stock market. In my opinion, 1 of 2 things will change this narrative. 

1.) Interest rates go up - J Powell has already said this is unlikely to happen for another year or so. When this *does happen*, we'll likely get a slew of money flowing *out* of stocks and into bonds which will cause a short term correction. 

2.) Proof that the weak economy is affecting tech - We've seen a restructuring of the market sectors like never before. Tech is holding the bag for the entire market and until it's common knowledge that something is wrong in this space, they're unlikely to falter. 

&#x200B;

Back to today - I'm looking for the shorter-term trendline around **337.30** to hold. I'll use that as the first sign for more downward pressure. **340** should be resistance as it's a big round psychological number. The top of the longer-term channel comes in around **341.75** today. That would be the cap on any upward action.

The trend is your friend, until the very very end.

t3_idkg78,$GEVO Trade Review,"Hey guys! I typically choose one trade per day where I either traded something very well or very poorly and journal the entire thing. Over time this has allowed me to identify opportunities where I can improve. I call it my Playbook. I traded $GEVO 5 times today and wrote up my typical journal entry and thought you guys could benefit from it (or at the very least, the process behind what journaling can do for you).

\--

Date: 8/20/2020

Ticker: **$GEVO**

**The Big Picture**

$SPY experiencing a slight pullback after retesting all-time highs the day before and the premarket action was looking bearish. I noted premarket low (PML) at $335.31 prior to open and was holding a put position from the night before that was ITM. The tech sector once again looked strong with $AAPL sitting on a new $2 trillion market cap but a worse-than-expected unemployment report cast doubt on a bullish recovery. Overall I felt that the market open would be bearish.

**Premarket Technicals**

$GEVO was missed by my scanner but picked up by Huso. A powerful premarket move of 78% before a slight pullback formed the first set of support and resistance moving into the market open. Just before the market opened, price reclaimed the resistance level, as well as the 13EMA, and showed high relative buy volume on the 1m chart. At market open, my premarket high (PMH), PML, and point-of-control (POC) were $0.9838, $0.7595, and $0.8808 respectively.

**Execution**

I took five trades on $GEVO. The first trade was at market open with an average entry price of $1.04. I took this position because within the first few seconds of the market opening, we had blown past PMHs and had accompanying buy volume to support the push. Price action stagnated and began consolidating before dropping below market open. My original stop loss of $0.9549 was hit for a loss of \~8%. 

The second trade was an aggressive entry into the 13EMA test after bouncing off my POC. My average entry was $0.93 and my original stop loss was $0.87, slightly below the POC. Price trended in my direction without a significant amount of buy volume and so I adjusted my stops aggressively in the case of a flash sell off. We hit a peak price of $1.16 before selling off and my stop was triggered at $1.07 for a profit of \~15%.

My third trade was a conservative entry based off of a previous resistance breakout at $1.16, aggressive buy volume, and a wedge formation. My average entry price was $1.17 and my original stop loss was $1.09, slightly below the ascending support trendline from the wedge. Price moved in my direction slowly through two brief consolidation periods, where I moved my stop loss via time, until claiming the 13EMA and forming its first parabolic move towards $1.495. I was stopped out on the subsequent selloff and breakdown of the 13EMA at $1.37 for a profit of \~18%.

My fourth trade was made directly after coming back from lunch. $GEVO was forming a double top and consolidating above the 13EMA which allowed me to play the breakout to the upside. My average entry price was $1.57 and my original stop loss was slightly below the next support level at $1.47. $GEVO broke to the upside, formed a descending triangle, and broke out again. I was stopped out on a flash sell at $1.75 for a profit of \~11%.

My final trade was made directly following the bounce off of the halt. I had a clear resistance level marked near $1.91 and waited until price broke to the upside to go long at an average entry price of $1.92. We made a fast move up to the daily high of $2.16 and began to consolidate. I moved my stops up with an expectation of a second halt incoming and instead price traded horizontally for 2 minutes. I chose to manually close the trade due to indecision in the market, and (luckily for me) price subsequently moved down into a halt. My average exit price was $2.06 for a \~7% profit.

**Intraday Technicals**

I had no original price targets on how high $GEVO would go. As we approached the $2.00 level, I noticed that price was beginning to feel âtoppyâ. Watching the action at the $2.00 breakout and subsequent stop out, I knew that many traders would be trapped on the long side north of $2.00 which would give short sellers an edge in control. I decided to stay out of $GEVO until it found support near the VWAP or showed significant strength for a reversal. 

**Key Takeaways**

Two things stood out to me during $GEVO: 1) never underestimate the power of FOMO. Without an original price target made premarket, itâs important not to sell out of winning positions too early. Temporary pullbacks will occur in small caps that are trading with a lot of volatility so keep in mind moving forward to work on differentiating between a pullback and a trend reversal. 2) I need to work on position sizing. There were two trades where I only went â in because of fear (more than anything). Do not be afraid of volatility as long as you have a plan. I made a lot of profit trading $GEVO today, but I also left a lot on the charts. Do not be afraid to go heavy into your A+ setups.

Gap Downs: EL

Possible Day 2 Play: TGT  (Day 2 means it moved yesterday and could possibly set up again today)

Well well well, I was wondering when that selling was going to happen. SPY gapping down slightly after testing resistance/all time highs and then selling off. To be honest, nice small pullback or base in the market would be healthy as we are still overbought and have went on a good run recently. This would give charts time to set up again and new stocks the opportunity to emerge and start new rallies. Right now the market is sitting on the 9 ema and could likely move higher but I will keep UVXY on my radar in case we have follow through to the downside. Pre market is flat so running a scan after the open will help find more stocks, if I see anything else before the open, I'll update this list. Good luck trading.

Here's what I understand:

* Stock splits on 31st of August
* Clearly this is driving up the stock value as we head into Friday the 21st

If no new stockholders next week would be eligible for the stock split, does this mean that the stock value will begin dropping come Monday 24-Aug, since people won't be dying to get in before the split anymore?

Also, how will Tesla/NYSE monitor who had the stock when? What's to stop me from selling my stock on Monday 24th and how will Tesla/NYSE know not to split that stock on the 31st for the owner that owns it all next week?

This scan will find stocks where price is *within* 3% of the 200 MA, **and** the 50 MA is *within* 2% of the 200 MA. Basically it's detecting where the 50 & 200 SMA are in the same general area, and price is close by as well. 

The idea here is the 200 MA is already a big institutional support/resistance area. The 50 MA just adds fuel to the fire. Unless there's something that's fundamentally changed within a company, you can expect to find some sort of resistance/support at these levels.

t3_iekxm1,Tax implications of my trading? Wash sale/TTS/etc.,"I started investing a few months ago, took a break to paper trade and study options. I now have been trading options on a single stock (AMD if it matters) and have been having success with it consistently. I am typically trading into and out of 50-75 contract positions about 5 times a day, all for less than an hour apiece. I cannot wrap my head completely around the tax implications for me on this, or what I need to do to ensure that I am not screwed by it. My  understanding is that normally (w/o wash sale rule) I would only pay taxes on my net, so if I made a gross profit of 5k and gross loss of 2.5k I would then pay ST capital gains tax on the 2.5k. But with the wash sale would I be paying on 5k of gains, even though I have only 2.5k actually made from trading?

t3_if0hpm,New to Crypto day trading 100k,"Hey guys, I been in crypto since 2017. I have attempted day trading a couple times but got burnt a little and gave up. I'm familiar with trends and some TA. But I never day traded 100k before. So I decided to give it a try. I decided to trade Polkadot it was new and on uptrend but somewhat flat. I was trading on the 1 minute chart. My plan is, get 1 trade a day right, make 1000-2000 dollars in 5-15 minutes and get off ""work."" Well I made 3k today off 2 trades. Maybe I was just lucky. So throughout the day I practiced without actually using any money. Called all of them right with Link, BTC ETH and XRP. Made some more calls correct with polkadot on its downtrend. I just zoom out and look at the trend and resistance levels.

I'm conflicted honestly. I am originally an investor. I want to do both, but this money I was trading was actually a good portion of my long term portfolio. reason why I am doing this is because in crypto I feel like we are in a bubble again for some of these ""defi"" coins like chainlink running up from $1 to $20 and Lend basically 100x. It's nuts in crypto right now. So I went into a stable coin and bascailly got the idea to try trading.

I'm just looking for advice.  Maybe stick to my long term positions and work for another 2 years and save up another 100k, maybe my investments will moon again, and then I'll have 100k again to trade (at this point screw real estate and dealing with nasty tenants!). I will definitely continue to practice trading. I just see this possibility of quitting my 9 to 5, but I want to invest long term too. What would you do? Stick with the long term investments or turn my portfolio into a trading machine?

I don't want to day trade $10,000 and try to trade 40 times in a span of 8 hours. That sounds dumb and you might as well be at work. I need a $50k - $100k stack. 1 trade per day done and over less than 20 minutes. Trading on the 1 minute, should be over under 5 minutes.

t3_ifttyx,Profitable Swing Trading Strategy (for Beginners).,"I don't know if this is the right sub reddit to post this, but the last time I posted a strategy, it did pretty good and benefited some people.

This is a SWING TRADING strategy. If you're looking for a day trading strategy, you might want to skip this article.

**Difficulty-  Easy**

This strategy is very easy to execute and I tried it often during my second year of trading.

Time Frame- 1 hour or 1 day. I usually select 1D to analyse and 1 your to take entry /exit.

RULES.

1. Find a stock that is going in a sideways direction over the last few months or years.

2. Find the strong Support and Resistance zones and mark them on the chart.

3. Find the correlation of the stock with the market and determine the delivery percentage of the stock (this is an optional step, but it improves accuracy).

4. Buy near the support and sell near the resistance zone. Short near the resistance and cover near the support.

5. Look out for breakouts or breakdowns and pay attention to volume.


**An Example**

There are 3 stocks I traded a lot using this strategy. The first one was called Coal India. I took my first major (1000+ shares) position in this stock.

I'd observed that the stock only moved from 230 to 280 range.

The stock used to go up to 280-285 and reverse from there. And it would take support at 230-225 lvl and reverse up from there.

This wasn't just a coincidence. The stock showed the same behaviour for YEARS.

So I exploited the hell out of this stock. I bought it at 235 and sold it at 280 and did the same for almost a year. It worked like magic until the stock broke down.

I used this strategy on a couple of other stocks called ITC and SBI.

You won't find tons of stocks that trade in a range for years but its not that difficulty either. It'll take a bit of time but it's totally worth it.

If the stock is at 100 and the support (long term) is at 90 and the long term resistance is at 110, I buy at 90 and sell it at 110 and short it at 110 and cover at 90 (assuming no breakout takes place). 


**Things to Consider /Drawbacks**.


I connect at least 3 zones of support and resistance and I also look at the time it takes to go from support to resistance.

If the stock rallies from S to R very fast with huge candles, it might breakout from there. The size of candles can say a lot of things.

The volume in this setup isn't a much. If there is huge volume near the support or resistance, it might be a sign of a breakout or a breakdown.

You can also tell by the size of wicks and a bit of price action patterns (doji, bullish engulfing) if the stock will reverse or not. 

**Bonus Complimentary Strategy**. 

If the stock is at 109 and there's a resistance (long term strong) at 110 and I decided to short it and a breakout takes place, my stop loss will get hit. 

What I do is wait for a small retracement, it usually happens and my resistance now becomes a support. 

I take a long trade on the same chart after confirmation. 

Even though I lost money due to a breakout, taking an opposite trade will recover my losses. 

** FAQs **

1. Stop loss? Below the low of a long candlestick's wick or a few points below support (long). 

2. Time Frame- 1D for analysing and 1H for entry and exit. 

3. Indicators? - I usually only use Price action with this strategy. Sometimes I add VWAP/EMA. You can also use Pivot points for it. 

4. Risk? - Very low (if you don't take 20x leverage or anything crazy). 

5. Success rate- High (if you're good with price action and know how breakouts happen). 

6. Profit? - LOW. The profit in this strategy isn't a lot but the successful rate is high and the risk reward is pretty favourable. 

7. Time period? - Usually from 5 days to 14 days. 

You can try it on intra day, but it doesn't work well for me. Sideways market in intra day is not very profit friendly. The movement is low and the time is limited. 

However it works pretty well in Swing trading. I don't use it very often (I'm more into Breakouts and Trend following) but it's good for beginners.

I am new to trading in general and have lost a total of 11K out of 35K in the past two weeks. I have come a long way in terms of learning the markets, but clearly there is much work to be done. 
Specifically, most of my losses have been from the last week. Yesterday I was up $800 at one point trading PM, but I took a $200 loss and decided to enter a trade to recoup the loss.

...well, we had some fun and it seemed promising but we started concentrating on creating own software more than trading. But now, 1,5 years after we created the scripts we think it would be waste of work/time not to share the possibilities.

t3_igqxx0,"$MSFT - Might Break out Soon, Keep in your Watch List","I was just looking at some charts and found out that MSFT can breakout in the next few days and that would be an excellent entry. Just wanted to share it with everyone here. Let us look at the charts.

# 4 Hour Chart

[4 Hour Chart for MSFT. Resistance at $216.5](https://preview.redd.it/ve42gnckg9j51.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ff94ff38c4f0458e7f1eb63faebb2be2531e7f7)

Looking at this chart, this is the third time MSFT is hitting this resistance level. It's also consolidating at this level instead of just running directly to the level. That is usually a much better setup since you have a stop loss right below the consolidation area at around $212. The best entry would be at the breakout (ensure that there is some heavy volume) or on a dip at 216.5 after the breakout.

# 1 Hour Chart

[Similar setup on 1 hour chart as well](https://preview.redd.it/ltge7f72h9j51.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2175efcd6150b32dc43dfb31d47988c7663c11e)

Similar setup on 1 hour chart. Right at the resistance. If there is a small pull back on 215 or 214, that's okay as long as there isn't a heavy dip.

Lastly, I checked my own dashboard as well and all of my tools are bullish on MSFT in the next 1-2 weeks. Here is some information about today's options flow + some probabilities for a bullish move in the next few days.

1. This number shows the Alphatrends anchored VWAP starting at the March 2020 low. It is always important to anchor from capitulation points and pivots.
2. The blue â1â shows consolidation to the anchored VWAP before finding perfect support at the anchored VWAP before the pre-earnings move up.
3. The blue â2â shows price pulling back and consolidating back to the anchored VWAP after the drop in price after earnings.
4. The volume shelf is created by the âvolume by priceâ tool anchored to the March capitulation point showing almost all shares holding at current price levels which causes supply to dry up once sellers are done taking profits from lower entries. It is also important to note that the next area of supply above will act as a resistance zone for traders.

**345.60** \- Channel top

**344.70** \- End of low volume area

**339.60** \- Gap fill / prior breakout area

&#x200B;

# Gameplan:

The trend is your friend until the end. I have to tell myself this each and every day in order to stay sane in this market. Look at this chart of AAPL: [https://imgur.com/a/RD7jvhv](https://imgur.com/a/RD7jvhv). Does anyone really believe something has fundamentally changed over the past year with AAPL that warrants them going parabolic? We're in the midst of a melt-up, but believe it or not, we still have a lot higher to go.

Enough about the longer-term future. What's the deal with today? Well we've got Jay Powell speaking at 9:10am which is sure to stir things up. Recently there's been a lot of ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" going on. Could that be the case today? Maybe. The important thing to understand is these events normally lead to emotional reactions in the market. And emotional reactions usually lead to a 100% retracement.

We've been trading in a channel for the past 2 months and yesterday we breached to the upside. That channel top comes in around **345.60** today. If we were to close meaningfully within the channel today, it could be a sign that we're headed to the other side of the range. What's the other side of the channel? Right around **333.00**.

With the feds speaking this morning, it's going to be tough to trade the SPY and so I'll be focusing on other things this morning. That being said - one thing that stands out to me in yesterday's profile is the complete lack of volume in the middle. This tells me a couple things:

1.) Price was not tested in this area

2.) There was a lack of commitment on a day that saw a large move up

3.) BONUS: All day yesterday was supported by bearish internals

Given all those things, I like the chances we come back to test at least the **345** area. Pay attention to **346.30** as it's likely to have breakout potential to the downside.

t3_iixptc,How to Track your Trades- FREE Template.,"Most traders, especially beginners don't track their trades. They don't have a proper system.

When I was new to trading I bought random stocks, made some money or lost a lot of money and forgot about the trade.

But now, I have an Excel sheet and I write down the details of all of my trades. It helps me find out a lot of data. 

My average win rate, the avg risk reward, the most profitable and least profitable days, why a trade went wrong, etc. Its very easy to find that. 

I've made a Video on how I track my trades using a trading journal. 

**[You can watch this video to understand the entire process. ]**(https://youtu.be/cYvk-b4S7Jo)

If you already know how to do that, you can skip the video and start documenting. 

Documenting your trades is very easy, it hardly takes a minute but it seems like a chore. But it's worth it. 



[Click HERE to download the FREE template ](http://vikrantblogs.com/important-links/)

Here's the template I personally used to track my trades. If you're a beginner and have no idea how to make the excel file you can download it. 

It's complete FREE, you don't have to give your email id or anything.

t3_ij73ha,OVERCOME ANY LOSS *[Must Read]*,"Trading goes hand in hand with life itself, How?
Let me explain in short.
Well you don't go through happy days in life everyday, track back your memory to relate with my strategy, Just like you go through the charts. What life is a balance of good and bad days same like the market, its moving up and down but not moving in a particular one direction.
Perfect life doesn't exist so forget about perfection and you should realize this sooner the better cause it's a must awareness regards to every trade you take, expecting to hit TP everytime and forget to put SL gonna blow you off one day or other.
Don't expect, sometimes this same expectations hurt rather figure it out if you were right as you get your results. Forget you'll close your trading session with green numbers always, sometimes you gotta close in red too cause those red number are deductions for the paid lessons. Now journal what those lesson or mistakes thought you and always remember this ""the losses you close are nothing but paid lessons for future performance"". Next time when you lose trades dont aim to gain your account loss in the same session rather wait let the revenge mindset calm down, ""never trade with emotions - trading psychology"", take your time to overcome the loss. Sit, journal your trades and figure out what went wrong and use the knowledge that experience bought in your next trading session and repeat till you see the results yourself.
I cant explain any better than this
""You either win or you learn""
There is no loss in trading. It's a matter of prospective, 'how you view every opportunity and failure'.
You should love what you do so you wont give up on your love story to last long in the glory.
BONUS: Keep a growth mindset.

Gap Ups: ADBE, BABA, NVDA, RUN, RXT, SPCE, YUMC, 

Gap Downs: BIGC

Day 2 Play: NTNX

SPY gapping up at the time I'm writing this. Not much of a gap at all, basically flat. If the market holds up, flat opens are usually good for trading as much of the range hasn't been used up pre market. TSLA and AAPL both had splits and should be interesting to watch today, but keep in mind they are not gapping up or down, this is just a split. The Market is still overbought and pre market is the flattest I've seen in a long time, so today will be a good day to run a scan at the open and look for high volume momentum plays. If the market decides to pull back, I will look to see if there is any setups in UVXY. As far as gappers go, there isn't many as of right now but I will keep scanning and add anything if it looks interesting. Hope everyone had a good weekend, good luck out there.

t3_ikj8h9,$UTSI Trade Breakdown (Stop Holding Losing Positions),"\*\* Originally wrote this up post-market yesterday but I figured some of you would find value in it. We open up trading live Monday and Thursday to the public and encourage people to call out tickers and trade ideas that they see. This came from one of the call outs and the thought process behind why we decided against taking the trade.

About 30 minutes into market open, $UTSI was called out in here as something to watch for a potential breakout (probably because it was being shilled in other Discord groups and people ended up catching poor entries). We pulled up the chart and quickly identified a potential double/triple bottom forming on the 1 minute. Although rare, double/triple bottoms are very bullish patterns once confirmed to the upside but have a high rate of failure prior to confirmation. At the time it looked bearish and we called it out that there was no significant sign of a bullish reversal coming in. A triple bottom formed, failed to confirm, and broke through to the downside where we immediately dismissed it. 

Over the course of just a few minutes we had completely dismissed the trade and moved on. Time behind the charts is your best friend. Study, study, study. Chart attached for reference:

t3_il6rgf,I lost money shorting a stock from â¬100 to â¬2. Looking for some good books improve my trading skills.,"So back in June I was a newbie to trading and even plain old investing. Jumping in and out of Tesla and AMD stocks then selling and moving to Apple all within a few days like a complete autist.

Around that time I read about Wirecard's scandal and decided to short it on the way down. ""Literally can't go tits up"".

Somehow, every time I opened a short position, the stock went up and I went in the red. When that happened I sold my position at a loss. I did this a few times, the whole way down from â¬100 to â¬5. Every time I shorted, the stonk went up. I didn't make a cent. I was thinking ""am I the unluckiest / dumbest trader in the universe or what?""

I didn't blow up my account or anything, and haven't yet. Was only doing baby trades.

Fast forward a few months to September and I am getting better. I can handle those (very minor in hindsight) price swings and stay in the trade and make money. Of course I don't make money all the time, but I am getting better. However I'd like to beef up my knowledge on when to enter a trade. I can definitely improve on that.

I am really not a fan of putting one thousand indicators on a chart and fibonacci rings and head and shoulders etc. Some of the stuff I've seen in the ideas section of Trading View look like a child threw 12 buckets of paint at a wall.

Is there a good book out there that goes over entry / exit signals, spotting a trend etc. without going into full blown technical indicator mode.

I've just ordered "" [Stan Weinstein's Secrets for Profit in Bull and Bear Markets](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1556236832/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)"" after skimming through a sample of the book and seeing it recommended here on reddit. He does use technical analysis but it doesn't get out of hand from what I saw.

Any recommendations for I guess ""beginnner"" technical analysis? No fibonaccis etc preferably. I tried youtube but they're all selling stuff and it gets very annoying.

Note: My investing discipline is fine. Haven't touched my investments in a few months other than adding more money to them.

# Gameplan:

Let's first cover the elephant in the room. What in the hell happened yesterday? We had been making higher highs 10 days in a row. That's what happened. We were melting *up*. So we had a *pullback*. Albeit a large one.

We pulled up juuuust short of the 20D moving average yesterday. If we get there today, don't expect it to be support. I thought the final destination yesterday would be **339.72**, we have a prominent gap which was gapping over the all-time pre-COVID highs. We never retested that breakout area and what do markets like to do? Re-test former breakout areas.

Normally on a swift re-entry of a channel we melted out of, we should expect price to target the other side of the channel. I should also note that this channel is steeper than the melt up we were on pre-COVID crash. It's unlikely we can sustain being in this channel forever, let alone *above* it.

In the image above you can see the light blue lines which represent unfilled gaps. We've got one waaaay down at **286** which quite frankly may never get filled, but we've also got one at **326** which looks like quite an appealing buying opportunity. In short - we could go plently lower.

Lets talk about today. It's another summer Friday, in fact, it's the last of the summer Friday's. We're headed into a long weekend and *normally* these days are defined by low volume. What's the path of least resistance in low volume? Sideways to higher. To be frank, I have no idea what kind of volatility will show up today so until we're in the thick of things, it's impossible to tell what type of day it will be.

Let's say we *did* have a low volume day and the market went sideways to slightly higher. Who is that good for? Unequivicolly it's good for the *bears*. Like it or not, the bears are in control of this market and until we see some sort of bottoming action, the prevailing short term trend is *down*. The long term trend however is still *bullish*. We're still above the 20 MA, we're still inside a rising channel, we're still bullish long term. When does that change? When we break the bottom of the channel. 

Finally, what do the bulls need to do today to re-claim their throne. Getting above **350** and re-claiming the channel top would be the first step. We have retracement levels which come in at **350.59** being the 50%, and **352.47** being the 61.8%.

I posted a new video yesterday about Gaps, here's the link if you missed it: [Gaps And Why They are Important To day Trading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnWDa7GECuQ)

Big pullback yesterday in the market. Not surprised one bit as I had been expecting it and had mentioned a few times previously that we were overbought and needed a pullback. Everything's fine, no need to panic, it's not the end of the world. A pullback in the market is healthy as it gives stocks opportunities to rest/correct and set up new moves. Trading action yesterday was great despite the market falling and likely today we will see some continued volatility. Weve sold of for 2 days in tech and the qqq is approaching the 20 day moving average which could act as short term support. I will be very patient today and look for direction before entering positions. This could be a choppy day so If you got killed yesterday and aren't feeling it, just don't trade. Sit back and watch so you can be prepared for next time and help retain your mental capitol. Gap list sucks today, so run a scan after the open if you can't find anything and as always if the market continues to decline I will look to UVXY for opportunities if they present themselves. Have a good weekend and good luck trading. See you all Monday. EDIT: I forgot, Monday is a holiday, see you all Tuesday!!

t3_inopxk,The Importance of Risk Reward Ratio (and risk management).,"So, I changed my time frame on Thursday (or Wednesday) and tried trading breakouts with that. I also made a little change in my strategy.

The day didn't start well.

I made the first trade hoping for a breakout. Didn't go as planned and the stock went down. I cut my losses quickly and exited the trade.

The second trade wasn't good either. I made the same mistake again. I was impatient and didn't give enough time for a confirmation.

I lost a bit of money on the second trade too. I decided to make 1 final trade for the day. I didn't want to overtrade.

Trade 1- LOSS
Trade 2- LOSS.
Trade 3- PROFIT.

2/3 losses, that's a TERRIBLE win rate. Around 33.3% and flipping a coin has a higher win rate. Normally my win rate is 65-70% but that day was bad.

But even after 2/3 losses I made around 2% profit (net).

2% may not seem a lot, but I am a Conservative trader. I don't YOLO on TSLA Calls. I follow risk management and position sizing. Its boring but it matters to me.

So I lost around 1-1.5% on the first two trades combined.

And won around 3-4% on the third trade. I didn't take any crazy leverage, just a little.

What's the moral of this?

Even with a terrible win rate, I managed to make a little profit. Why? The size of my profit was bigger than the size of my loss.

I personally think that patience is one of he hardest things to learn as a trader. You may disagree. But when I make a little bit of profit, I try to sell asap.

I have noticed that these darkpool wicks lays out clues to an overall picture. These wicks will give me a general direction as to where the price will travel to. Not always but in the short-term time frame I have noticed this to be the case. Other than direction (combined with other indications) it gives me levels to trade off of ie. support and resistance in combination with levels I have already identified.

I will walk you through a option trade I initiated with AAPL pre-split. Few days before I have noticed consolidation tightening on AAPL pre-split. One of my criteria, great. The next morning pre-market of the run up to 137.5, I noticed this print and have traded it before. Keep in mind since we are at ATHs I do not have a level to target unless I use Fibonacci Extension. The wick was kind enough to lay out a price target for me.

If you look back in time you will notice these wicks. Attached are examples I have seen and example u/beborequiem pointed out on SPY and AMD. I tend to see these on the 1hr time frames and below. Rarely will I see anything higher than a 1hr time frame.

I never use this wick solely as my main criteria but it gives me a good basis as to how I personally trade.

The market sold off some more yesterday, The QQQ is sitting right on it's 50 day moving average and SPY sitting right above it's 50 DMA which has been acting as support for the past few days. If the 50 day moving average breaks and the market continues to decline, the next support on the SPY is around the 319 area and then the 200 day moving average.  Since we are holding the 50 day ma and have sold off, we could get a bounce today, however it is Friday so we'll have to see what happens. The pre market is almost flat, one of the flattest pre markets I've seen for a while so there is not much of a list. It's a good idea to run a scan after the open or even just sit out if nothing presents itself, this may be a choppy day. If I find anything else, I'll update the list before the open. Have a good weekend. Good luck trading, see you all Monday.

t3_iqoxrd,Critique my trading rules! (or steal them for yourself),"I am in the **process of beginning** my trading career and what follows is the set of rules that I have come up with to add structure and routine to my trading.   
What I have not discussed within these rules includes things like my daily preparation routine or specific trade setups. They'd be whole posts on their own! 

Please feel free to critique these rules (don't just tell me what I've got wrong or what you would change - ***tell me why*** as well!). The whole point of posting this is so I can receive some constructive feedback to help optimize them (and share them with whoever is interested as I haven't seen many posts like this recently). 

Also, keep in mind that I am from Australia and exclusively trade Australian Equities so these rules are written from that context but could easily be modified to suit any market around the world.

Much of the credit for what I have put together here goes to **Mike Bellafiore** (specifically his book ""The Playbook""). I have taken many of the concepts from his work and the **SMB Capital** Youtube resources to come up with a set of rules that suit my personality and trading style. 

&#x200B;

**Intra-day Rules**   
**Daily Strategy**   
â¢ Identify and *eliminate repeated mistakes* through process of trade review *(defined below)*.   
â¢ Only focus on *one setup* at any given time across *no more than 5 stocks* per day.   
â¢ Commit *(risk) 30%* of intraday stop-loss *(defined below)* to A+ setups *(defined below)*.   
â¢ Archive in Playbook format *(defined below)* my trade of the day *(the trade that had the best outcome or made the most sense to me â ideally both)* at the end of each day.

 **Daily Loss Prevention**   
â¢ Intra-day stop-loss of *$ Value of Â½ my average profitable day* for the past 10-day period.   
â¢ Intra-day give-back rule. Stop trading for the day if I *lose 50% of closed profits* during the day. 

**Trade Review**   
â¢ Trade strategy. *What are the rules and parameters for this particular setup?*   
â¢ Trade management. *Where could I have responsibly been bigger in this trade? Why?*   
â¢ Trade review. *How do I feel about this trade/setup? How can I improve for next time?*   
â¢ Playbook my trade of the day. Include the following:   
*1. Big picture analysis*   
*2. Intraday fundamentals*   
*3. Technical analysis*   
*4. Reading the tape*   
*5. Intuition*   
*6. Trade strategy*   
*7. Trade management*   
*8. Trade Review* 

**Intra-trade Rules**    
**General Rules:**   
â¢ Stock moves against my entry price? â Hit out of the position quickly.   
â¢ Cut losses quickly at a predetermined price.   
â¢ Trade only âin-playâ stocks *(defined below).*   
â¢ Avoid stocks with high short interest.   
â¢ Only trade excellent risk:reward setups. *Consider the ATR & RVOL of the stock.*   
â¢ Stick to predetermined lot sizes.   
â¢ Avoid removing market liquidity *(hitting bids and paying offers)* when possible. 

**Entry:**   
â¢ Determine the type of trade *(move2move or trade2hold)* before entry.   
â¢ Move2move = Scalp trade   
â¢ Trade2hold = Hold until Reason2sell *(long)* / Reason2cover *(short)*   
â¢ Enter in tiers.   
â¢ Add to positions as they work in my favor. 

**Exit:**   
â¢ Exit in tiers.   
â¢ Exit either a tier or whole position when presented with a Reason2sell *(long)* or Reason2cover *(short).*   


**Reason2sell/Reason2cover**   
â¢ Price target reached   
â¢ Too much of a pullback    
â¢ End of the trading day   
â¢ Thesis no longer valid   
â¢ Breaking news released   
â¢ Stock breaks its uptrend /Stock breaks its downtrend   
â¢ Key resistance level approaching /Key support level approaching   
â¢ Overall market resistance /Overall market support   
â¢ Buying pattern dissipated /Selling pattern dissipated   
â¢ Unusual seller on tape /Unusual buyer on tape   
â¢ Price rise up too steep /Price drop too steep 

**Position Sizing**    
â¢ Position size = Risk Ã· Stop size   
â¢ Stop size = Entry price â Stop-loss price   
â¢ Tier size = Maximum of 100 shares initially until I have the statistics to show that I am ready to handle larger lots. 

**Stock Selection**  
I will trade only âin-playâ stocks each day. These stocks will be identified before the beginning of each trading session throughout my preparation process and reevaluated during my midday review. Stocks may be âin-playâ for reasons including but not limited to:   
â¢ Strong news catalyst *(for individual stock or whole sector)*   
â¢ Unusually high volatility *(determined by scanner)*   
â¢ Unusually high relative volume *(determined by scanner)* 

**Trade Process**  
Each trade I make will be graded before taking a position by assessing the confluence between the following 5 determining factors. These 5 factors are all of significance and present clues as to what the outcome of any given trade is likely to be. It is important to keep in mind that it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any given trade in advance and each trade is statistically insignificant and unrelated from every other trade. An A+ setup is identified as a setup where confluence is observed across all 5 of the following factors. These are the trades that I will risk the most on â I will enter with size and with confidence.   
**1. The Big Picture**   
How have the International markets behaved overnight? *(How may this affect the Australian marketâs movements today?)*   
What is the Australian market *(XJO)* doing? *(Is it trending? Is it in a range? Is it near important support or resistance levels?)*   
What is causing the market to do this? *(Is there a strong news catalyst? Election? Major world event?)*  
What key technical levels *(support or resistance)* is the market approaching that may cause it to stall or reverse?   
What level is the volatility index *(XVI)* of the Australian market currently at?   
What is the most likely price action movements of todayâs market considering these factors? 

**2. Intra-day Fundamentals**   
What is the general sentiment regarding this particular identified stock? Why? *(News catalyst? New product? Earnings? Government investigation?)*   
How may this general sentiment influence the trading decisions of market participants? *(Is this a positive or negative catalyst? Are most people considering buying or selling?)* 

**3. Technical Analysis**  
 What key technical levels are relevant to the current price of this stock? *(What levels in the recent past has the stock found support or resistance?)* Look for areas where the price has consolidated recently for extended periods of time and with greater than usual volume traded. Also, look for inflection points where price movement has reversed in the past.   
Consider *(not as important as a STRONG key level)* other indicators such as VWAP, EMA, etc. *(Keep it simple with these indicators. They will not necessarily determine price action but they may have psychological significance to others which is primarily why they are of use).*   
Consider other variables of the stock such as the short interest %, the float *(and short float)*, the institutional ownership %, the insider ownership %, the ATR, the RVOL, etc.   
What is most likely for the price action for this stock to do today due to these factors? *(Do I see a potential trade setup forming?)*  
Develop if->then statements that will prepare me for all possible scenarios that I may encounter whilst trading this stock/setup. 

**4. Reading the Tape**   
Use the tape *(time and sales)* and level 2 *(order book)* data to closely examine how the other market participants are buying or selling the stock.   
Use this information to confirm my identified support/resistance levels *(key levels)*.   
Watch how the bids/offers stack in certain areas.   
Get a feel for how the stock trades.   
Identify the % of the volume traded on the bid vs traded on the offer. This will add conviction to my assessment.   
Read the tape & order book constantly throughout the course of the trade to identify entry and exit points *(reasons2sell/reasons2cover)* for the trade. 

**5. Intuition**   
This is only for more experienced traders. After many hours of screen time, you will develop a strong intuition which you will learn to rely on more heavily as time goes by. At the beginning of your trading career, your intuition must be all but ignored.",59,0.93,1599824932,"[['ATR', 1]]",ATR,117.12999725341797,116.75

t3_iroj2z,Day trading journal and how you guys log your progress?,"In researching journals I see a lot of people putting unnecessary things into their journal and I'm curious how most of you log your trades.

When I say unnecessary I mean a lot of people log their trades in spreadsheets or excels with numbers listed everywhere but don't even have a screenshot of their entry & exit, the volume during the position - candlesticks - anything on the technical side - regarding how that trade was managed in real-time. 

fundamentals are important of course for choosing your stocks in play or even catalysts for that example but I don't get how someone could log their best trades without a screenshot of their actual positions in the trade - where they entered / exit - if they scaled out - how they manage the trade etc that all plays into the results not just the numbers behind it.

I'm currently on paper this coming week is going to be my 7th week, I have screenshotted and logged my trades since the first one - I'm using think or swim and it allows me to easily click the show trades button and I can see my position size as well as how I managed the trade - in my log I will keep track of the float - market cap - short interest - average / current volume - ATR - and whether there is a catalyst or not (which i prefer) I don't really pay attention to anything else before the trade or in my logs as far as fundamentals go.

I have taken a step back from my journaling and every day I go over my trading journal - noticing a lot of my mistakes the thing I'm realizing is naturally I'm prevalent to noticing my mistakes just as any normal human should, its almost like it takes 2X the good to make up for the 1X bad.

Hope everyone had a good weekend, now it's back to business. Market sold off again Friday, nothing extreme, just some more profit taking, nothing to be alarmed about. Right now both the SPY and the QQQ are sitting right on top of the 50 day moving average which should act as some sort of support.The 9 ema and 20 ma are overhead now so we are kind of stuck in between short and intermediate term moving averages. This may or may not result in choppy trading, just depends on the sentement of the market.

**335.36** \- Hourly Gap

&#x200B;

# Gameplan:

Today has all the makings of a big day for the market. We're testing the upper end of a bear flag and could continue in the northern direction, or we could see another leg down in the market. How low could we go? Our bear flag was about 9 points high so we take the low of \~333 - 9 and we get **324**. That would be my target for another leg down. The concept is called *market symmetry*.

All week I've been saying the prize is **342.50** and they finally managed to do it in pre-market trading. What's driving this market higher? If you're looking for a *reason*, one that's good as any is the fact that Fedex reported a blow-out quarter. Investors generally tend to think of Fedex and UPS as economic indicators. Lots of packages flying around means lots of people are buying things. Increased consumer sentiment means and better economy. 

From a technical perspective, I circled the *poor high* on the chart above. Poor highs are not what marks the end of a move. Poor highs mark the end of a short term move where price pulls away, building energy to break through. If you noticed this at the end of the day yesterday, you could've bought a small position into the strong close with the assumption we'll at least test this level again today. Just in the past 2 weeks we've seen them do this over and over again.

So what's the play today? For me, it'll be the sidelines. We're poised for a large move one way or another and I don't want to be caught if it goes against me. We have the fed meeting wrapping up and from 2-3pm there's sure to be some volatility coming into the markets. In these scenarios, you can be *really really* right for a couple seconds, and *really really* wrong a few seconds later. The market will take your lunch money, so just stay out. 

Into these events it's normal to see a consolidation. What better price to do it then just under the breakout area of **242.50**? Could we see a breakout *before* the fed announcement? Anything is possible but history would tell us no.

t3_iuui0o,Changing your strategy to adapt the current market conditions.,"I decided yesterday I was dead set on trading Nvidia for today. I put in my brackets right after opening bell it passed right through it and I started the day with $800 loss. I kept bag holding (revenge trading) and ended up down $1800 just 90 mins after the opening bell.

I struggle with brackets, I can never get in the right spot and always ends up catching on a loss or never reaching my profit. The challenge was, the market sediment was affecting the stock price. And I couldnât see that sitting side-by-side with a chart of the UVXY and NVDA.

I stopped and thought what wasnât working, the brackets werenât working. What would help me solve the problem, knowing what was going on in the market that was affecting the stock price.

The one minute time frame wasnât working, so I change the timeframe on all charts to 133 ticks.

So I looked up the ETF that had the biggest holding of NVDA, it was QQQ, I opened up that chart and added the study that shows me volume based on buying and selling in color.

I could look at the volume on QQQ and when people were buying on the bottom end of the bollenger band I bought NVDA and when the trend shifted to selling I sold or short the stock, coming off the top of the bollenger band.

I was able to keep the UVXY in the corner of my eye and when I saw people buying the UVXY (in the times and sales windo) it slightly preceded the selling volume on QQQ, and I could short Nvidia accordingly. 

I got rid of the brackets and just did market buys and sells (or shorts and covers) of 100 shares at a time. And I was rarely looking at the Nvidia chart when I was making these trades, I was really looking back-and-forth between QQQ and UVXY.

it was working so well, it started to fall apart about 30 minutes before close, when the stock started to get erratic and volatility doubled/tripled. But I was able to finish the day at an $900 profit, rather than walk away an hour after the close because I was down for the day and didnât want to lose any more money.

I trade using TOS, how can I improve on this technique and not leave myself vulnerable using market orders?",5,0.78,1600383827,"[['NVDA', 1]]",NVDA,479.54998779296875,515.3400268554688
t3_ius1lb,Why you should use futures to day trade,"Just read a post of someone reaching 25k in their account and being happy they can trade without worrying about the pattern day trade rule. Awesome to hit a goal like that but I would highly encourage anyone attempting to day trade to look at futures. The vast majority of professional day trading is done using futures and hereâs why...

- No pattern day trader rule. As long as you meet the initial and maintenance margin requirements for the contract youâre trading than you can trade all you want. Micro contracts are awesome if youâre learning, have a small account or just want to hedge.

- Higher liquidity/less slippage. The S&P, (ES) Nasdaq (NQ) and bonds (ZN/ZB) contracts are some of the most liquid markets in the world. You want to scalp fast? Just hit buy/sell market and donât worry about your fill (unless the market is in free fall but you already had a stop on right? :-)

- Simple, simple, simple. Bullish? Buy. Bearish? Sell. A lot of people are intimidated because they think futures are complex but the reality is there is nothing easier to trade. The only slightly complex thing is the margin rates but that takes 5 minutes of reading to understand.

- Capital efficient. The notional value of the contracts give you the best bang for your buck (even better than options in most cases) and as I mentioned above the newer Micro contracts are an incredible vehicle to use. 

- Taxes. This is the big one. 60/40 tax treatment means 60% of your gains are taxed at the lower long term gain rate while 40% are taxed at short term rate. Plus, NO WASH SALES!!! If you have any goals of day trading professionally than futures are your best friend when it comes to taxes. 

- Hours. You can trade almost 24/7 from Sunday evening to Friday. Want to hold a piece of that sweet day trade overnight? Yep. Want to hedge a swing trade? Yep.

t3_iuqrtx,Scalping % Goals when trading?,"Greetings all, I've been trading on and off since 2017 buying long and also scalping. Im just curious what day traders/scalpers % goal is before you usually exit a trade. Happy with 2%? 5% or confident enough to have a goal of 20%+? Also, how much money do you trade with each trade usually? Few hundred, few thousand? I aim for at least 5%, trading about $3-600 a trade until I'm more confident with higher amounts. 

I started really well trading just buy guessing. Had 50 share of AMD at about $8/9 and a few others like that. My brother trades and I got a friend into trading (who now makes 30-100K a month, seriously.  So I got into options and day trading. Started trading options with no idea what I was doing or how to read charts or day trade. Lost about 6k in 3 months with about 8/9k in my portfolio. Barely traded for about a year minus a few things my friend told me to buy. Started trading again a few months ago, but by learning with sub $200 options with the goal of % rather than $ until I was confident I knew what I was doing to trade with more. Now I'm trading $3-500 at a time so I can get some money out of trades before starting to trade with more when Im more comfortable.

With the $80-150 trades, I would regularly get 5-15%, but then seeing how little money it was, I would get greedy, counter to my strategy of just looking for % wins. So I recently bumped up to a higher amount so I can better be satisfied with 5-20% and exit. 

I use RSI, macd, bollinger bands, patterns, volume and trend lines and working on candle reading. 

So again, just to see what others goals are, what % are you normally looking for and how much do you trade with usually?",4,0.8300000000000001,1600371667,"[['AMD', 1]]",AMD,73.8499984741211,78.19999694824219

Caught a nice bounce in SPY off of support via the 50 day MA on the daily. Pre market pretty flat with the SPY and QQQ  both trying to hold support on the daily charts. Ideally we would like to see these areas of support on the daily charts hold/base and then move higher, so far so good but I won't be fully convinced this is just a dip until we break back over our short term moving averages, until then I keep an open mind as to direction and will be taking long and short positions while we are in this small range. May be a good day to run a scan after the open since the pre market is flat. It is likely that we see some follow through on some of the plays from yesterday but since it's Friday and the market is caught up in these moving averages it could be an inside sort of choppy day. Either way, there will always be plays, we just have to find them. Enjoy your weekend. I'll see you all Monday. Good luck out there

t3_iw7u69,Introduction to market profile / volume profile,"# What is market profile?

You can think of market profile as a more detailed version of a daily candlestick. Market profile is like a daily candlestick that also tells you *how long* price was in an area as well as the *volume* *traded* in that area.

The blue box is a representation of the volume traded at this particular price. 

To the right of the box we have a bunch of letters. These are called TPO's or Time Price Opportunities. Each letter represents a 30-minute period of the day. 

A = 9:30 - 10:00  
B = 10:00 - 10:30  
C = 10:30 - 11:00  
...

A & B are always surrounded by a black box and represent the IB or initial balance. This is the first hour of trading.

The yellow background signifies the VA or value area. The value area is where 70% of trades took place on that given day.

The black box represents the POC or Point of Control. It is the price where the most volume was transacted on any given day.

https://preview.redd.it/wgtxq0dyd8o51.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=a14156898b8d1271ed9b331789665ed762c349a0

Starting from the top. 

The first thing we see is a steady decrease in volume as the price rises. This is how a typical auction should end, with buyers gradually deciding the price is too high and *no longer fair.* 

Compare this with the other end of the days range where we see what's called a *poor low*. A *poor low* is the opposite of what we saw on the top end of the profile. A poor low ends abruptly without a tail of single prints/excess. Single prints are rows with only 1 TPO. For a move to complete, we like to see at least 2-3 rows of single prints to signify either the buying/selling has died out. 

In a poor low scenario, you have lots of sellers still active at the 'end' of a move but when price moves against them, they're forced to cover their positions resulting in a dead-cat bounce. However, we know that sellers were active at these lower prices and unless something has fundamentally changed (news), the selling is not likely to be over. Poor lows are *normally* 'repaired' by having price from a future session extend below the poor low. 

If you're curious to see how the example above played out, this was the market profile from 9/20/2020.

# In Conclusion...

The amount of information given in a market profile chart makes it my go-to chart for daily price analysis as well as swing trading. Volume is an important tool and when many shares are transacted at a certain price, that price is likely to be important in the future as well.

t3_iwrq2x,Airlines are Gaining Momentum - DD & Options Flow from Last Week,"I was looking at some options flow from airlines mid last week and realized that it was quite an imbalance between the CALL premiums and PUT premiums. The chart setups were all looking great so I thought about giving them a few more days before taking a look again. I analyzed the flow today and it looks like airlines are gaining some momentum by options traders. Let's do some DD, shall we?

For the analysis, we only consider five airline symbols and option contract trades with premiums above $25k.

In order to start our analysis, let us first take a look at the aggregated options flow from the week of **September 8th to September 11th**. Below are the aggregated stats:

[Aggregated Options Flow for the week of September 8th](https://preview.redd.it/9xvwck9rveo51.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae633d70d4423e68e634509dcedcfcc325ff530c)

A couple of observations from here. Most airlines had a pretty even flow **except $DAL** which moved quite a bit this week because of the large flow in the September 8th week. But the other airlines had a fairly low options flow.

Now, let, us take a look at this week's option flow which is significantly different.

[Aggregated Options Flow for the week of September 14th](https://preview.redd.it/80wpc80vveo51.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0889e28d059c19b6a290f213191bdcb390daee)

Pretty clear differences here. Although we had one more trading day last week, the premiums and volume is way higher than the week prior to that. There are some stark differences in the call and put flow.

* **$AAL** had some differences in volume but almost the same premiums for both CALLs and PUTs. That has been a consistent pattern. If I want to go long on airlines, I'll stay away from AAL just based on the flow.
* **$DAL** as usual had a difference of 13 million between CALL and PUT premiums. That is massive. The volume was also 3x.
* **$JETS** had a way higher volume for CALLs than PUTs. The premiums are also like 4x for CALLs vs PUTs. This is excellent for someone who wants to go long on airlines and JETS right now.
* Both **$UAL** and **$LUV** were also massive on the CALL volume and markedly low on PUT volume. The same goes for premiums. Things are heating up!

If you look at the price action of some of the airlines, you can also see bulls taking over for the last few days. Let's do that as well. I will draw a few loose trend lines to show that the airlines have been on a slow bullish run for the past few days and based on the flow, that is expected to continue.

That's it from me folks. Hope you like the analysis and will keep an eye on the airlines. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts and hope you folks have a fantastic week ahead.

Same day aapl is trading around 110ish so if sell that at 110 price I would profit 1k. Subtracting the contract fee and the commission am I not left with 700 profit?

t3_iyjmmo,Anyone here use Wyckoff? Can you walk me through SPY today?,"I am attempting to learn the wyckoff method but I simply don't understand how anyone can tell the difference between the phases or the features.  For example, how do you know the difference between a Spring, a Secondary Test, and a genuine breakout?

I am trying to apply the concepts to the SPY, which is what I mainly try to trade.  I prefer the 5m chart but the 1m chart may work better for this so I will use that (probably doesn't matter though).  I see about 6 different trading ranges today, but none of them seem to ""fit"" the wyckoff method.

An obvious example is the 10:35 bar.  This looks to me like a spring, but instead of taking off higher, it actually runs several more smaller tests in both directions before finally breakout out to the downside. This whole range from 10:45 to 11:15, doesn't seem to have a selling climax, automatic rally, or a secondary test.  If anything, those three things happened in reverse.  I think there may be a breakout/LPS, but its sketchy.

If you view that range as though the 10:35 bar is actually the selling climax, followed by the AR at 10:50, the ST at 10:52, well then it appears that you never get a phase C or phase D. 

If you look at the range from 12:45 to 1:45, I dont see any indication that it will break one way or the other...the final break may as well have been another test.  I can't identify any of the features or phases in this block.  same at 2:15-2:25.  Actually, at 2:15 -2:25 there was another ""fake"" spring...it actually looks a lot like the early morning range just smaller.

The range in the final hour of the day before close, sure looked like it was going to break out upwards...in fact it looks IDENTICAL to the textbook ""accumulation phase"", yet it eventually broke downwards.

t3_iy0thm,"Advice I really wanted to give to new traders, im a new day trader myself but I take it very seriously,","**Edit before you read:** I have traded live for 3 months but had so strategy and switched to a new broker so I wanted to learn the platform so I went to paper on thinkorswim and took it most seriously, *before you shit on this post its for  new traders, newer than me that I'm 6 months in.*

For starters im paper trading now dont shit on me for paper trading, I have 60k in savings at 23 im frugal and im not about to spend my savings because I was too dumb to dive, in. I traded live for 3 months swing trading, I know how the emotions feel, and anyone who tells you paper trading is the same as live trading is lying.

**You dont learn to fly a plane getting thrown in the cockpit? You go in a simulator first.**

&#x200B;

**Paper trading is not the same as live trading but at least it lets you know how you need to think, it helps you more clearly develop a strategy otherwise if you dive in thinking you know it all you will get punched in the face before you re-think your entire process** & yes that happened to me.

ANYONE who makes posts on Reddit talking about their success 99% are BS posts I have been trading for 6 months now I study & learn new golden nuggets every day and I still don't know shit in fact no one knows anything or **no one knows what's gonna happen next**. 99% of reddit, some twitter posts, stock twits, are BS everyone's insecure and whats advice when to sell and buy or what to sell and buy everyone follows the crowd, I barely come on these types of pages and this is why. Chat rooms are basically BS everything is a big ball of BS, come back to me in 5 years when I know more than I do now & ill tell you im still learning.

The best way to describe it to me is.. **think of most of the trading community as a corporate job, everyone discusses what the other person is doing, said, gossiping, talking shit, coming up with theories, spreading rumors, lies.** Where if you sat in your cubicle with your 1 homie and focused on shit together you probably would be better off shit, if you're by yourself that's okay too. Trading is very lonely I can see I'm very new to it but I can see to what it is. A friend brought it on to me but I took it very seriously from the start, I took a month of educating before even buying my first share, he's more of an investor with no motive or interest to do his own research, he doesn't have the funds to day trade but even basic fundamentals or charting skills he has none, zero.

If I go anywhere on any chat room any comment section, people will ask whats your PT, when should I sell? how do you know this? that? Its easy to get lost and I truly and learning every day but the biggest help for me has been putting 11 sticky notes on my screen to remind me to sit on my hands. I have journaled every trade since the first one & I suggest you do as well, I go over what I did wrong, right, what I will improve on next time. I record every single trade and go over it at the end of the day, I go over all my trades at the end of the week, I meditate and prepare psychologically for a good day, if I wake up late I woke to go on the computer and trade I will go on a walk before my coffee come back stretch meditate and trade. **Patience is key, persistence is key. Im breaking even all the time, I'm paying market tuition but I'm learning**, I very strong risk management, I stick to really 2 strategies and if they are not there I won't trade.

***Things to take note of or reminders for your trading:***

1. **Don't be impatient -** sit on your damn hands & wait for A+ setups
2. **Have a plan**, don't FOMO jump in. If you do wait for a pull-back and make sure you have a plan
3. **chat rooms will fuck with your head, you're never going to be a good trader with that shit around**, unless you really really have a small group and extremely supportive of your millions of answers but even then your almost looking for the 'answer' for it all. This being said there is exceptions where some discord channels have excellent education tabs or groups online do, go on youtube go look at blogs don't go to one source go to a bunch and go for what feels right for YOU.
4. **log your trades**, you will thank yourself for this I go over exactly where I entered by using a screen shot of the trade itself, entry and exit. A lot of traders use excel sheets with a boatload of numbers and criteria but personally that's not for me it may be for you, Im more of a visual learner. I mark what I did right, what went wrong, what I could have done better, where was SPY at the time of the trade, what was the ATR of the stock, short interest, float, market cap, news, did I mark previous areas of value? important areas of support and resistance? I will edit this photo with blocks showing the type of stregy it was, what I will do and prepare for next time, did I take a start position? Did I scale out of my position immediately when I saw a profit? was I eyeing level 2? I found in logging my trades I used to put all the bad trades and then one good one, now I only put the good trades and screw the bad ones as humans we naturally focus on our failures and remember them so why not hone in on our successes and what exactly about it to the tee made it a winning trade for me? I also rephrase words like ""loss"" to ""cost of doing business"" like people say think of it as market tuition, loss is just such a harsh word there is no way to look at that otherwise. I promise you making your own playbook of your best trades will be the best thing you can do, especially screen recording. I will see trades and this light pops in my brain saying this is your playbook trade you cant skip out on this, I enter and before I even enter the trade due to the ATR i know exactly the max I could lose multiplying - # of shares X my cents I'm risking below support. and the ATR shows me my expected PT for the trade. This is just what I do, regardless it doesn't matter find what suits you, but If you're paper trading and not logging your trades and just doing it mentally your wasting your time.
5. **if / then statements** \- couldn't be any more helpful if you dont know where your getting out then why are you even getting in, again trading is simple but it sure isn't easy, buy at support / sell at resistance right? Seems life changing & so easy when your first see those things then you try to determine good risk reward opportunities and your in the heat of the moment chasing things and messing up but you can look at the chart later and say oh, ""if only I bought here"" patience is so so key, it really is. I have to instill it every day, I am so new to trading but I do everything I can to better myself every day, and all my mistakes are psychologically and dealing with just how I handle myself, the impulsiveness, the hesisitation, trading too large, overtrading, these are all the things that mess me up and they will do that to you too. So be aware of yourself that's the best thing you can do as a trader. Your trading journey is identifying where you go wrong not the market, it just makes opportunities all damn day, its you to capitalize on those, flow with the tide not against it.
6. **talk to yourself - yes literally out loud.** I screen record myself with my voice guiding my thoughts in that exact moment only so I can watch it later realize it didn't actually go down as fast as I felt like and think wow what an idiot what were you thinking... well! im thinking out loud so I can actually hear my damn mistakes.
7. **Most importantly do you even love trading?** \- If you are influenced by the money only and simply have no interest in trading you're going to fail simple as that, my dad forced me to do so much shit in my life, yeah I was good at them but I was passionate enough to be great, this is the first time I have ever truly wanted to spend every single second doing something. From the morning I wake up, until my body tells me I can finish where I left off tomorrow\*\*.\*\*
8. **If you really love trading - learn to have balance** \- this is something I need to remind myself of. I have saved my money for a long time, trying to make my dad proud of something, not knowing what the fuck im doing with my life and going to be 24 in a few months. I have become obsessed with this, it really is the first time I dont want to watch movies, I dont want to play video games, I spend every breathing second learning how to trade better and learn more than I did the day before. I need balance and everyone does, dont let it control your life.
9. **Trading is a lonely and challenging aspect but what are you really in it for?** \- I love the challenging aspect of trading, I love that many people cant make it, I love most that It allows me to learn about myself, the way I psychologically deal with my mind and my day to day, how I handle hardships, how I face things within myself, I have always loved psychologically studying a couple of courses at community college and business but it brings them both together, it fascinates me.
10. **Dont get stuck on paper trading -** As I said above the only reason I went to paper trading is because I wanted to learn my brokers platform, (thinkorswim) I wanted to hone in on one or two strategies which I currently am, I believe those who shit on paper trading started off live and once they got punched in the face revised and took that as the bias towards creating a strategy, i dont know everything but im not an idiot i already said this happened to me, so to not have a strategy and then switch to a new broker no knowing the platform will set you up your failure. Dont get stuck on paper trading though, set a time frame you want to be on it for I think 3 months is a good go, some people stay on it for a year and I dont think thats good, again you can ALWAYS go back.
11. **Paper trading is simply to format strategy and learn from your most common mistakes -**  All my mistakes right now majority of them come down to impatience because if you are patient and wait the opportunities there and you will just know if studied that set up enough, it will stare at you and almost say ""buy me"" those have litterly been my best moves that I have felt and are in my playbook where I recognized them and added them as good risk reward opportunities, its easy to want to buy everything and this is why I disregard most reddit posts and chat rooms its easy to say huh what is everyone buying before you know it you're clicking away and incorporating a strategy only resembling gambling, its like you're obsessing with the green on the screen. If this is really a problem for you, *remove your P/L from the screen, if your broker wont let you remove it litterly tape a paper over that part of the screen a trader cares about risk / reward and good opportunities to benefit that's what gets you P/L not magically watching if it will be there.*
12. ***My favorite places to learn are..*** *If I had to choose two places for you to go as a new trader is SMB capital youtube videos - they are authentic/real / no BS and can guide you in the right way.*

*Chat with Traders Podcast - there is a little over 200 podcasts roughly 35-60 minutes each I have listed to 80 of them so far and I log notes and journal on them all - if you want to really hear how pro traders got started go here, what they do and how they do it, a lot of them you will find stuck with one thing, and do it very very well.*

13. **My favorite trading books...**

I have read **trading in the zone by Mark Douglas, the Warren Buffett portfolio** (just a basic book on warrens principles of investing and going with what you know, not checking your stocks every day and buying Stocks only if you plan on holding them for the long term) after reading this book is when I cleared up my portfolio and now only have large blue-chip companies mainly tech. Iâve also read **price action trends by AL Brooks. How to day trade for a living by Andrew Aziz, Trading Psychology 2.0 by Brett Steenbarger, mindset by Carol S. Weck** Is one of the best psychology books Iâve read it really is eye-opening to how you deal with things in boat trading and life. **One good trade by Mike Bellafiore Owner of SMB Capital** this book talks a lot about focusing on quality over quantity and identifying your mistakes And I am like 100 pages left of his second book called **the playbook** which has to do with journaling and tracking every single one of your trades and primarily having A separate journal where are you put only one trade from each day that really stood out to you and made sense and why. These last two books have been my favorite I think. If youâve ever watched any SMB capital videos on YouTube you know how straightforward forward and authentic they really are.

**Why did I make this post???** \- I made this to remind you - the reader, I made it to remind myself. Im a big fan of progress in my life but also in seeing shit down to the core of what it really is. I made this because I saw someone post a BS story of how to make it as a trader and I see to many and it pissed me off.

**there isn't a time where you just ""make it"" as a trader** its not like oh here's your master's degree.

t3_izlx8c,Piker Bot - Bot for Executing Swing and Day Trades,"*Reposting this, because I posted it at 2am and it got lost in new.*

I had been sharing some of my progress with this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/iumzaf/my_little_bot_has_really_mastered_the_buy_high/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/iz57on/ive_been_working_on_a_bot_to_swing_and_day_trade/) and after some thought, I decided to share all the code

Before we get started, I'm sharing this, because I don't actually think I am giving anyone else really an edge here and here's why:

* My background is about 13 years of software development at some pretty cool places and gigs, but only about a year worth of trading.
* I wrote most of the entry and exit decisions the bot makes based on a crash course consisting of this [guy's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFSn-h8wTnhpKJMteN76Abg) and various books.
* This bot does not attempt to determine tickers, entries, exits and stop losses. You have to do that. Therefore, it's ability to make money is based on your ability to pick winning trade setups.

So what is this then? It's my personal toy project you can use to learn from. I have some screenshots of me turning a tiny profit with it using 5 trade setups in the [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/iz57on/ive_been_working_on_a_bot_to_swing_and_day_trade/) and explain what the bot did or didn't do.

It's an attempt to turn trading into a sort of effortless game I play on my terms. Here is how I see it working:

1. I spend about a hour and a half in the pre-market hours reviewing price action charts on different stocks, looking for solid short term setups, which I record in my trade journal in Google Drive.
2. Once the market opens, I go to work on my software engineering gigs and the bot pulls down all my trades from the journal and execute them during the market hours.
3. Once the market closes and I am done working, I can review my trade journal to see how the bot did and prepare for tomorrow.

The code for the bot can be found here. There is a in depth readme that's up to date as of the time of this post.

# Questions From the Other Threads From People

**What language is this in?**

All in Python, baby.

**Can you teach me?**

Oh no, you sweet summer child, you.

I taught myself a few months ago and... uh... you can, too, using a [bunch of cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-bots-tech/python-cheatsheets) I wrote to help me learn.

**How long did this take you?**

One month to learn Python and two months to write the bot, part time. I had done most of my technical analysis 101 research before that. I am pretty good at what I do though and a top performer among my peers at work a lot of the time, so expect this to take much longer.

**Why didn't you use an existing framework like Quantopian?**

Because I am a software engineer and all my personal toy projects have to be as laborious as possible.

That might seem silly, but I've learned ssssoooo much about the workings of the stock market in the last three months by doing this. It's been quite fascinating.

# Bot's Read Me File

Stock trading bot for executing swing trades or day trades based off price action while I work. The general idea I had here was to be able to load up a trade journal in my Google Drive with trade setups and then, have the bot execute them while I work my software engineering gigs.

This bot DOES NOT attempt to autonomously determine tickers, entry and exit prices on it's own. If it did, it won't be called a piker bot.

This is a very much an alpha work in progress personal project by a software engineer with a bad attitude. It's not for public consumption atm and I don't have a set of solid step by step readme instructions on how to run it. If you don't have a background in software development, this might be a bit much for you.

## Features

* Reads queued trades from a Google spreadsheet in my Google drive and adds them to it's local sqlite3 database
* Heartbeat pulses every minute and checks the price on tickers from trades in the journal.
* Bot purchases the stock when certain combinations of conditions are met. This is still in testing and tuning.
   * If the bot comes online while the price is above the entry price, it will wait for it to fall below the entry price before
   * flagging the ticker as primed for a trade.
   * Once the price is below the entry price, but above the stop loss, the bot will wait for it to rise above the entry price before proceeding
   * Once the price rises above the entry price, the price must be above the SM5 to show a stable start of an uptrend and the RSI must be under 40(45?) to show it's still oversold.
* Buy orders are good for the day only and then the trade is marked as expired if not filled.
* Bot will sell the stock when combinations of conditions are met. This is still in testing and tuning. At the time of this writing, I think I might be trying to ride an uptrend too hard.
   * First, the price must move within 1% of the entry price.
   * Once the price is within 1% of the entry price, if the RSI goes above 70 at any point, the bot sells immediately.
   * Or otherwise, the bot waits for the RSI to rise above 60 while the price falls below the SMA3.
* If the trade is flagged with the 'sell at close' boolean, the bot will force a sale within the last 30 minutes of the market being open.
   * It will also prohibit the purchase of shares within the last hour of the market being open. This is to prohibit the bot from immediately opening and closing trades. Might raise this to 1 hour 30 minutes.
* Sale orders are good until canceled to try to keep you from holding bags forever.
* Number Shares to purchase are calculated at the time of the sale, based on how many can be purchased using a percentage of the total brokerage account.
   * This is based on cash only; not margin buying power. It will not take you into debt to make trades.
* As the trade progresses, the bot automatically updates the sqlite3 database and the trade journal in Google Drive.
   * When it opens or closes a trade, the bot will update the trade journal with a snapshot of technical indicators at the time of purchase or sale. It is also capable of retaining the technical indicators submitted by the trades module in the stock-scripts repo. I plan on writing a script take all of this data and generate html reports for reviewing the trades.
   * It USED TO generate it's own candlestick charts at the time of purchase and sale, but that feature was properly sacked as it caused me a whole bunch of nonsense and weren't very good anyways.

## Libraries

* numpy
* alpaca\_trade\_api
* ezsheets
* schedule
* beaker
* stockstats

## Configuration and Installation (that may or not work depending on how much coffee I've had)

* Clone the Stock Library repo and follow the README instructions to install locally with pip.
* Clone the piker-bot into the same parent directory containing stock-libraries.
* Copy the example\_configuration.py file and rename it bot\_configuration.py
* Follow the notes in bot\_configuration.py to configure the bot properly.
* The Google Drive API will provide instructions on how to activate the API on a first run.
   * You MUST complete this before you attempt to create the docker image. It will add credentials files that are needed in the docker image.

## Running the Bot

## Docker Image

Run from the parent directory containing the project folder and the stock-libraries module. You need to have run it manually once to setup the credentials files for your Google Drive in the piker-bot folder. Be sure to alter the data folder in bot\_configuration.py to point to the mounted folder for the container prior to building.

docker build -f piker-bot/Dockerfile -t piker-bot .

docker run --name piker\_bot -d -v \[PATH\_TO\_YOUR\_DATA\_FOLDER\]:/var/lib/piker-bot piker-bot:latestEx: docker run --name piker\_bot -d -v d:/development/docker-data:/var/lib/piker-bot piker-bot:latest

## Running the Scripts Manually.

You can execute main-pulse.py to fire the heartbeat pulse once or run main-scheduler.py to activate the scheduler and begin pulsing the heartbeat every minute for an eternity. I've used these with windows task scheduler if you don't know docker, but its not as stable.

How do you set this up in windows tasks scheduler? If you can't google that and figure out, you really shouldn't be messing with this.

## Usage

After the bot runs the first time, a Trade Journal will be created in the root of your Google Drive. It will have a Queued Trades sheet which the bot will pull from when it pulses every minute. It is recommended you fill out your trades before activating. Once trades are read, they cannot be altered without changing the bot's local sqlite database which means COMMIT to your trades lol.

t3_izjubl,Absence of liquidity vs actual buying,"I saw this a few times yesterday, an I just saw it again from 9:39 to 9:42 on SPY.  The market ran up 1.50 not on buying but on a lack of liquidity.  Meaning, market makers simply pulled liquidity and small orders took it up extremely quickly.  There was no actual volume buying these bars, and I have the Time and Sales to prove it.  So I have a couple questions.  First, how do you trade that?  Do you go with it or fade it?  And second, aren't the market makers supposed to do their job?  how is this tactic even a thing?  I considered that maybe some of the components like apple and netflix jumped, but if that were the case I think you would have seen actual orders come through.  Thank you.

I have few questions

* What do you guys think of Bullish Bears free course you think it's worth it and that they give good education and tips ( yes its free but it will take a week or two to finish it, just making sure that time was spent learning something valuable not bad advice )
* Starting out with a 1k capital first when I finish my 3 months simulator phase which hopefully starts October, but I heard about the PDT rules/ under 25,000$ capital so is there a way to get around that? And what are the hardships of starting with a low gpd
* are there fees if I want to withdraw ( example: I made 10,000 and want to put it on my bank account will it take 1-5% ? )
* why does it feel like the more I know the more I know that I actually don't know lol, it feels like being deep under the ocean trying to reach the surface but never seeing a light it feels Overwhelming and hard will this eventually end I mean I didn't even start paper trading I don't want to rush into this but it feels like a lot honestly ( any advice How to stop feeling that way and good content I can learn from? )
* Lastly, is where my motivation came from and why I started studying trading, I want to be rich and have freedom, I know this isn't a quick get rich bullshit but the reason Im starting this is less about I love the market and more of getting the lifestyle and luxury I want in the future, ngl after learning about the market its exciting and fun I know more than I knew before and want to be part of it, but still I feel like it's bad to have money as a motivation and it should be a job for those who love it, so should I change my motivation for all of this?

Anyone have any experience with interactive brokers adaptive orders? I'm switch over to IB which is so much better then my current broker trading 212 (they don't even show bid/ask prices).

 I understand the adaptive algo will scan the market to get you the best price for market and limit orders based on urgent/normal/patient priority, what is people's experience with the different priorities ? e.g problems getting filled?   Obviously depends on the stock liquidity, but if we say it is a highly liquid stock.

In afterhours trading and when market opens where you have extreme volatility and fast price action, do people use adaptive orders in those scenarios if you had to make a order?

If a catalyst for a stock just came out and you wanted to buy into the stock quick what order types do people use ? Would you just select the asking price and use limit order?

I have written an algo determining (stock specific) sentiment, I ran this on a dataset with (financial) news headlines (about 900k headlines), Twitter headlines and (stock related) Reddit headlines.

Hey traders.  I'm a new day trader using DAS with an account at CMEG. I'm hoping someone can help me with this trade that went south on me after some gains. I traded long on NIO this morning on some good volume and pre market price action.

1. I entered at 9:34am
2. I sold half at 9:38am thinking it would continue to go up after a dip (ABCD pattern).
3. At 9:40am I added to my position because I thought a saw a reversal signal right before the candle closed.
4. I got stopped out at 9:46am, then entered again at 9:47am thinking I saw another reversal. I was right since 3 minutes later it did move up but not before I was stopped out again. At this point I have negative P/L.
5. I entered one more time at 9:50am, partialed out at 9:52am, then got stopped out once again at 10:07am.

Hindsight is 20/20 of course. I could just tell myself that I should have sold 100% at 9:38am and went on with my day with an 5% profit on my account. But I was operating under the advice of other traders who told me that I should let my winners win (i.e. don't exit my position 100% if the stock is trending up). 

So the question is, is this good advice? I have seen trades and price action that supports this theory but obviously I tried to do this twice today and it didn't work. Should I just blame the market right now or should I blame bad advice?",3,0.81,1601485459,"[['NIO', 1]]",NIO,20.829999923706055,22.450000762939453
t3_j2nsdn,$BLNK - 5 minute opening range breakout (ORB) strategy reference.,"This reference is going to highlight three things; Scanning for stocks, entries, and exits. I have backtested and modified this strategy to my liking and the outcome has been very profitable in the last few months. 

**Scanning and playing the right movers:**

A trader is only as good as the stocks he trades. Take that quite literally because this is a codependant relationship and without one, you do not have the other and will be quite unsuccessful. A good opportunity is no good without a proven strategy and vice versa. 

Now scanning pre-market I look for 3 main things; *price*, *volume*, fundamentals. I scan for anything between $5-$30, gapping up or down >2%. *Volume must exceed 100,000 pre-market* and I like to see a further increase around 9-9:30 before market open, typically looking for *over 150-200k volume before market open*. Finally for price i'm looking at the Average True Range (ATR), I scan for an *ATR >$0.75* so I know that when I trade price wont go stagnant and not move despite all the volume (this is various liquidity issues). 

When it comes to fundamentals, I tend to play *medium float securities*; low float is too volatile and creates too many unnecessary variables for my liking. Large float stocks (AAPL, AMZN, SHOP) they don't move too much because it is too liquid in comparison to the equity being injected during trading hours. I scan for stocks with a *10-500 million float; anything below 10,000,000 is considered extremely low float* as is subject to a lot of manipulation by institutes due to the large capital they possess. I also *restrict the short % float to 30-40%* to reduce the possibility of unexpected profit takers selling off huge orders and tanking price, also.... short squeezes baby. 

Out of all these I typically take away a top 5 list of the cleanest movers pre-market that have presented themselves with the proper quantitative aspects that ive mentioned above. I look for a range of price that is directional and predictable and ensure that it is not overextended if it has gapped up a significant amount before open. 

**Trading & Entries**

Now ive tweaked this strategy to have the requirements of a sniper, it's not hard to come across but the way ive tweaked it restricts a lot of good potential opportunities; that is at a trade-off of an increased win percentage therefore minimizing risk over extended periods of time. 

* Price must create a 5 minute range significantly smaller than the daily ATR (opening 5 minute candle \[High-low\])
* Price may trade within the range, or breakout of said range. Long for upside breakouts, short for downside breakouts.
* Breakout must be directional in the direction of morning gap. If the stock gaps up, go long, vice versa. 
* Price must be above Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for long, below for short
* Moving Averages must be above VWAP for long, below for short. 
* Moving Averages must cross in the direction of gap / expected breakout. Bullish cross for long breakouts, bullish cross for shorts
* Price must be above/below 200SMA in direction of trade / breakout. 
* Entry point is at the break of the high/low (in this instance you can see I got filled at $10.69, $0.01 above the high of the 5 minute range for a long position). 

**Trade management and exit**

This one is up to trader discretion ultimately but I find for this strategy, being more passive with the stop loss points pays off quite well and minimizes stop outs than rallies up to your target. I placed my stop at major point of interest or technical levels. For this trade, my stop was the low of the 5 minute candle to breakout in the direction of trade; that being $10.50.

Other levels

* VWAP
* MA cross's
* New candles to make a low on 5 minute
* Significant price levels (Half dollars and Whole dollar levels)
* Previous daily technical levels.

Now for the exit, this strategy specifies everything except for a profit target. Since im trading breakouts with this strategy, there aren't many significant levels to trade off of when price is making continuous highs which it did in this case. I look for general weakness in price, keeping an eye on volume and looking out on the bid/ask for large single orders trying to hold trading at a certain price. In this case I saw weakness at $11.00, the high of pre-market. I started to see a lot of sellers and huge orders sitting around $10.95-$11.00 that were stagnant and scaring off traders so I hopped out for profits for a quick $0.26 per share.

t3_j2bqrh,Letâs talk scanners,"     Iâm at the point in my trading journey where I fully understand how valuable a good scanner would be.

I trade around 50 tickers and keeping an eye on all of them is impossible.

I have a paid TradingView account and am trying to get it dialed in,my criteria that I want to set it up is as follows 

1. Ichimoku cloud set up on 1m and 5m chart

2. 50ma crosses over 200ma on 1m and 5m chart

3. Price is above vwap.

4 price above 5ma

5. DMI oscillator 

6. TTM Squeeze

t3_j3g3wc,Buy&Hold vs Trend Following in Crypto,"There's a huge amount of people in Crypto who think that Buy&Hold is the best strategy. That might be true (especially when effort vs results are considered) for more mature markets, but I felt that in Crypto, simple Trend Following should be able to catch the bulk of the big moves and avoid most of the bear markets, so I ran some tests.

# Strategies

I picked some of the most basic Trend Following strategies with reasonable/round parameters:

* **MA Crossover** (*rx\_xma*)â when fast MA crosses over slow MA, go long. I will also use several different MAs for this â EMA, LRC (LinReg), HMA, WMA, KAMA, SuperSmoother, WVMA, TEMA, ZLEMA. `Parameters used: fast MA = 5d, slow MA = 40d`
* **Supertrend** (*SupertrendXm*) â uses ATR to get band width, goes long if price over the band. `Parameters used: ATR period = 5d, band multiplier = 1.5/2/2.5`
* **Bollinger Bands Breakout** (*rx\_bb\_bout*) â goes long when price over upper band. `Parameters used: BB period = 3d/5d, BB stddev = 2, MA = EMA/LRC/SuperSmoother`
* **High/Low Breakout** (*hilo*) â goes long when price over previous X days high. Close position when under X days low. `Parameters used: period = 5d/10d`
* **Linear Regression Slope** (*expreg\_slope*) â goes long when slope of regression > 0. `Parameters used: reg period = 5d/10d/15d`
* **Single MA/Price Crossover** (*rx\_xma\_single*) â goes long when price crosses over MA. Same MAs as *rx\_xma* will be used (EMA, LRC, etc). `Parameters used: reg period = 30d`
* **Single MA Slope** (*rx\_xma\_slope*) â goes long when slope of MA > 0. Same MAs as *rx\_xma* will be used. `Parameters used: MA period = 20d, slope period = 1d`

# Testing setup

* Long only.
* 0.10% commission.
* Simple condition for entry (long), reverse for exit (close).
* No stoplosses or take profits.
* Use 100% of balance on each trade (will add position sizing in next post).
* 60m candle size, except for *Supertrend* (1d to get daily ATR).

# Coins and date ranges used

I will use 25 of the \~TOP50 coins and 3 different date ranges. Specific coins for each date range depend on data availability. Some will use partial range data (starting later), specified in parentheses.

**Jan 2017 â July 2020**  
Coins used: XBT, ETH, XRP (since May 18, 2017), LTC, BCH (since Aug 1, 2017), XMR, DASH (Apr 12, 2017), ETC, ZEC, GNO (since May 1, 2017), IOT (since Jun 12, 2017), REP

**Jan 2018 â July 2020**  
Coins used: all of the above + BNB, EOS, XLM, ADA, TRX, NEO, OMG

**Jan 2019 â July 2020**  
Coins used: all of the above + BSV, XTZ, LINK, ONT, QTUM, QSH

# Conclusion

* Charts seem pretty conclusive to me: Trend Following > Buy&Hold.
* **You won't beat Buy&Hold like this on each and every asset that you test or trade live. But, over multiple assets, chances are you will on average.**
* Trade frequency is a bit low (0.5 - 2 per week).
* Max drawdowns are still pretty big (60 - 80%). Need some filters, stoplosses and position/risk management.
* **While it's highly unlikely to beat pure isolated BULL market (like 2017) with basic Trend Following, over longer periods with multiple big swings, strategies catch bulk of the moves and come out ahead.**",12,0.79,1601582587,"[['MA', 7], ['ATR', 2], ['BB', 2], ['X', 2], ['BCH', 1], ['DASH', 1]]",MA,336.010009765625,353.3599853515625

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY and QQQ gapping up pre market and everything is gapping up with them. I'm short on time so won't be much of a game plan today. SPY held the 9 ema yesterday which was a  good thing, now trying to break back over the 50 and 20 ema. Most stocks daily charts are getting oversold and most tech stocks look the same. I don't like the action on most days where everything is gapping up so I'll wait for a little bit at the open to find and then focus on the best plays that are trading separate from the market.

This post I suppose is ""Part 2"" my post back in April, [""After 2 years of Daytrading. 7 months full time.

**TL;DR** \- You'll become desensitized to trading. Stubborn to other strategies (There are bigger/badder/more lucrative strategies. Don't chase them. Why fix what's not broken? I know what works for me and I'm content with it. No strategy is better than another. It's a personal choice. ). Losing individual trades won't faze you, they're inevitable. Profiting certainly feels better. After a while, you won't be as enthralled to trade every morning, it'll become just another part of your day). Trading is just managing your money through a statistic and the medium to execute it is trading on your platform. **Think: ""If. Then. Because"".** Your trading plan should be that black and white. **Ask ""Why"" for everything you do and use. If you can't answer it with documented results, drop it.**

6. ""How did you discover your strategy?""
7. ""What did you do/How did you get started?""
8. ""What is your % return?"" (Not a fun question since a trading account is not an index or investment account. Intraday traders do not measure performance in %. Most are measured in ""R"".)
9. ""Is <insert sum of money here> enough to start trading?""
10. ""Why do you need so many monitors""? (This one is rarely asked but I do see it discussed on platforms and people trading on mobile phones love giving flack to anybody who trades on multiple monitors. Hint: Everyone's different. Whatever works for the individual. **There are no rules in trading. The only rule is that it works**.)

# My story:

**Background:**

I heard about daytrading during the **2008** crash while in high school. We all want to make more while working less. I entertained day trading from time to time but always realized I never had enough money. Horrible mindset because I could have still researched WHILE saving money to put into my trading business.

**2015 -** [I opened my first trading account with Scottrade](https://imgur.com/a/Vxcq07g) while in the Marines. Apparently if you have a net worth of over $1,000,000 you can get out early (Biggest rumor ever).

I frivolously bought crap penny stocks. In short - I was a hair away from gambling. What made it NOT gambling was the fact that at least I owned something tangible (Securities of a company) and anything can happen. Buy low sell high was my strategy. Didn't work obviously. No idea what I was doing. I'd buy and hold hoping to wake up to the stock price being way higher and it never happened.

&#x200B;

â¢**ProTip #1** : *If you hold a trade overnight... It is not daytrading. Stop turning into an investor because you can't admit a minor defeat.*

&#x200B;

**2017 -** I started taking this business seriously while working in the oilfield as a Logistics Planner (If you're wondering what company since I am asked this from time to time, Google: ""World's largest oilfield services company"").

No kids, girlfriend/wife or financial obligations. I worked 10AM - 7PM CST and would trade the open from home for roughly 1 hour. Later I was offered to be a Data Analyst... Only downside was... I couldn't trade since I had to be at work now at 8AM CST during the market open. In the moment of signing the offer letter, I was bummed thinking, ""No more trading,""

That wasn't the case though. You can still build your trading business with a 9-5 and while never making one trade. The data is there.

&#x200B;

â¢**ProTip #2 :** *We all see the same data. It's there forever. Many strategies show their edge both live and in hindsight the same. (Especially if you trade patterns). You CAN build your business as a trader without even taking a trade. You CAN build your strategy while working a 9-5. Just because you're not trading, does not mean you can't build your business through research. You won't know how you'll react to the losses but at least you can diagnose the raw data with a large enough sample size for assurance and confidence.*

&#x200B;

If you have a 9-5 and want to go fulltime into this business. Stay for a bit, save, live so far beneath your means that it is *almost* miserable, (depending on your expenses, area you live, family etc) and get a few hundred sample sizes of your strategy! And for your PTO/days off... trade the open. I sacrificed my vacation days to trade.

After **2** years in corporate America, eating cheap food, never going out, saving relentlessly, I made the decision to just do it and resigned. I went straight into the ring of fire known as trading. That was on: **September 23rd, 2019**

*""<insert a bunch of negative comments from family and friends of how bad of an idea it is to go resign from an easy 9-5.>""* ^((Sound familiar?))

&#x200B;

**When you hear these types of comments.. your response should be**: *""Nobody put the time I put into this. The 90%+ who fail, don't have it all written out, computerized backtests, manual backtests, statistics, SOP manuals, JUST like the job I have which is a business, I'm just another cog in their wheel. I'll just be wearing all the hats in my trading business. Instead of Oil&Gas, it's just for trading""*. One thing I see here a lot is people saying to trade X amount of months/years or make X.

&#x200B;

â¢**ProTip #3 -** *Think in man hours, not calendar. Example:*

**Trader A** puts in 1 hour of study/work/research everyday for 1 year. (**365** Hours)

**Trader B** puts in 12 hours of work **every day** for 4 months. (\~**1,450** Hours)

**Trader A** lives in a major city while **Trader B** lives in the middle of nowhere. (Think cost of living)

2 totally different living expenses and 2 different calibers of dedication. I'd put my money on **Trader B** because he put in more man hours. (**\~1,000 more hours** on the clock to be more exact).

&#x200B;

**ProTip #4** \- *Have a cushion in your account AND your personal bank account. Having a strategy is great but you won't know entirely if you can fulfill and execute your plan until you experience the ups and downs both short and long term. A strategy is constant over long periods of time... there will be days, weeks, and perhaps a month here and there where you aren't making much money. We hear all the time, ""Trade like a casino"". Casinos don't make money day after day but the odds are in there favor over the long haul.*

&#x200B;

**Month 1 of full time trading was great:**

Immediately after going full time, the first month **(September 2019 to October 2019**), I did super well. Business as usual. No stress. Everything going as planned. No turbulence. At least not like I had ever experienced...

&#x200B;

**The 2 prerequisites I had before resigning was:**

1. Show consistency in returns. Consistent Sharpe Ratio.
2. [Make a 4 figure trade](https://imgur.com/a/4O35MR2) (I achieved this while short 100 shares on ROKU September 20th, 2019 and even made a victory post if you scroll down my profile's posts.)

&#x200B;

**First life-changing trading lesson learned as a full time trader:**

That money printing spree ended on **NFLX October 17th, 2019**. Less than 1 month of being a full time trader. Deviating and going against my plan I actually made [$500 in a matter of 4 minutes](https://imgur.com/a/uLB7hsx). If you follow my watchlists on Twitter, **I always trade with the direction of the gap**. If I notate, ""Long Watches"" that means I will only trade it IF (and only IF) I see a long biased pattern. Likewise I will only be looking to short my ""Short Watches"". Plenty of times I'll call out a ticker and it immediately goes the other way. No harm no foul because there was no long biased pattern to confirm my thesis.

On 10-17-2019, [I went against my plan and it worked..](https://imgur.com/a/OcC8AV7) NFLX gapped up to resistance and I went short when it tanked off of a short pattern.[(This is known as fading)](https://imgur.com/a/9i2cdmi). The market gave me a free lunch and then some. So now I'm walking on air in my mind:

*""I'm an absolute unit""*

*""I'll do it again and clear another $500 to make it a 4 figure day before 9:30AM Central""*

*""Should have quit my job way earlier being this good.""*

Within 30 minutes of the open. I gave all $500 back. Yes I wanted to trade it back. Never have I had the desire to smash anything but I do understand those who do! Yes I stood there and felt like each passing second was wasted opportunity. **The next 24 hours were long!**

&#x200B;

**ProTip #5:** *It's circumstances like that that help you in the long run. FunFact: I never once deviated from my plan since. Not ever again.*

&#x200B;

""I could have paid for my groceries and electric for the month after 4 minutes of trading if I just took the free pass the market gave me"" I felt dumb but in hindsight, I'm glad at what happened. It was this exact instance that married me to my strategy/business plan. The next day and the **7** trading days following. I didn't make 1 profiting trade. My longest ever drawdown - **11 straight trades.** While researching I found out this was **Decision Fatigue** (I'll go over this shortly below)

&#x200B;

**Put yourself in that situation...**

You have bills and your income is strictly trading. I don't care how much a robot you think you are or how strongly you believe in probabilities, when you were in an office less than a month ago making almost 6 figures sitting in an air conditioned office knowing direct deposit is on its way every other Friday no matter how well or poorly you performed at work.. Now you're in the hot seat. Its a bottomless feeling. Now all of your friends and families words are ringing in your head.

But just like a boxing match.. you gotta take a hit to get a hit. Win some, lose some, shake hands and get back to normal life. Water under the bridge.

Mind you:

â¢No guaranteed direct deposit every 2 weeks.

â¢No more medical/dental insurance.

â¢401K retirement is no longer being matched.

&#x200B;

11 trades is nothing. You only require \~5.5 trades at 2:1RRR to make it back OR 3.5 trades at 3:1RRR. It's nothing especially in your research because [you can easily just scroll a little more and see, ""Oh that's just a drawdown. No big deal"".](https://imgur.com/a/2CYrFhP) How will you react in real time? Will you buckle or choke? But the thing is, I was skipping trades out of fear and JUST so happened to be picking all of the unsuccessful ones. *(Decision Fatigue)*

Think about those 2 weeks of being in a drawdown. Half of the month. You're not just stagnant, your account is bleeding slowly but surely. Next time you're looking at your spreadsheet/backtest/predictive model/research.. try to put yourself in those days of drawdown. **It's not just 11 boxes of red with ""-1R"" or ""Loss"" in them**. The screenshot above on Imgur is just a recent example.

Think about your daily routine, going to the gym, hanging with friends, grocery shopping, cooking, going to bed, waking up, doing a routine, then losing again.. and again.. and again. **Try to think of life during those 300+ hours (Weekends too) of, ""I haven't made money. I've lost money. And I still have bills. After paying them, I'll be closer to my set Risk of Ruin"".**

Here's a lesson you won't learn before going fulltime but I'll do my best to emphasize it here:

Pick a strategy. And stick with it. It can literally be anything. Don't spread yourself thin watching 20+ tickers and be a jack of all patterns/tickers. **Be a master of 1 pattern and master of 1 circumstance.** There's this real thing called [""Decision Fatigue""](https://imgur.com/a/MhWncCz) which explains exactly why what happened.. happened. The article explains that the 2 outcomes of this mental strain known as **""Decision Fatigue""** is:

1. **Risky Decision-Making**
2. **Decision Avoidance**

Sound familiar? Does it kind of make sense now? As a new trader you have YouTube, Facebook, StockTwits, Twitter, ""gurus"", books recommended on Amazon, all throwing their ideas/strategies around, the market has opportunities littered all over.. Decision Fatigue is inevitable for the unprepared. Decision Fatigue happens in every profession. If you mess up at your 9-5, its just a blunder, your paycheck will remain the same. Just a slap on the wrist and move on. With trading, you make a mistake.. it's less food on your table, lights don't stay on, and/or water isn't running. That pressure adds up. **No wonder so many fail...**

The signs of Decision Fatigue:

â¢Procrastination.

â¢Impulsivity.

â¢Avoidance.

â¢Indecision.

When you find what clicks with you AND its either statistically or performance proven, have the courage to risk a healthy sum of your capital into it. There are strategies/patterns/styles of trading littered all over the internet:

Very broad example:

""**IF** *circumstance happens* **THEN** *""Execution""*. *Stoploss is XYZ*. *Target is XYZ.* **BECAUSE** *over a series of Y trades, I will make $X,XXX.xx"".*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ProTip #6 :** *Strategies are all over the internet. It's your account/money, backtest it. People share their strategies here all the time and although I don't agree with them because I know what works for me, it's something to chew off of for you newer traders. YouTube is a harbor with people who give just enough info to figure their style out.* ***You will lose trades. Sit for some screen-time and pay homage to the edge that you discover. All in due time.***

&#x200B;

Insert key metrics and find correlations. This is how you create checks and balances to create/formulate a black and white trading plan. When I first started doing this, my spreadsheet(s) had so many columns it was annoying and would kill my desire to continue working. You'll find things that are imperative and some that are unimportant. For a lack of more colorful terms: *""Throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks""* **Trim the fat. Rinse and repeat.**

&#x200B;

# Here's some things I used to remind myself of and perhaps it'll ring some bells for you:

â¢**Surrender your capital to your edge**. If you truly accept the risk and trust your **proven** edge, losses don't feel like anything nor do profits. Although we're not here to put on losing trades and yes it does feel nice to profit. I still from time to time will excited when I hit target after a series of multiple profiting trades depending on my mood.

â¢**If you're nervous** or your heart starts beating quicker when you hear the sound effect of a trade getting entered/filled. Be honest with yourself and ask yourself if you're truly accepting the risk.

â¢**Things you can't take to the bank:**

1. RRR.
2. Win-Rate
3. Number of trades.
4. ""This one great trade that I hit target in less than 30 seconds and I got filled better than expected""

All of these are integral metrics. But you're trading to make money. **It's up or down, green or red, profit or loss, TRUE or FALSE**. So with that said, find what works flawlessly and is easy to follow. Checks and Balances. Then allocate a good sum of risk into it. I read it here all the time, ""Don't risk too much"" and that's great and true for new traders. But don't sell yourself short. Push yourself over the edge and admit that you know your stuff. Think of **Trader A** and **Trader B**. If you've put the time in.. don't sell yourself short. You've built enough courage to learn a business so many fail at. This business has such a negative connotation. But remember that not everybody can handle meritocracies and that's exactly what the market is. Don't try to be the best, just work harder than everyone else and the output of your input will be relative.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ProTip #7:** ***YouTube trading ads from gurus... they're subconsciously making you think you're a novice trader.*** *It's in their marketing. They study marketing psychology. The EASIEST things to sell:*

1. Health
2. Wealth
3. Happiness

People that are desperate for those things are the most vulnerable and these ~~""Traders""~~ marketers are fantastic at portraying all 3 of those things at once.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

â¢**ProTip #8** (***Broken record alert***) **:** *Write a business plan. Your strategy shouldn't take longer than 4 sentences to explain to another trader. When you have a plan that's proven through a statistic and WAIT for it to happen, you feel* ***100X*** *better taking the trade. You don't even care too much when it results in a loss. Because that was your plan, you accept it much better, and you know it was just an expense for a winning trade.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Want my strategy? *""I scan for stocks with a market cap of over 250M, 10k shares premarket, gapping to support or resistance, priced over $10, and I look for a pattern biased to the direction of the overnight gap.* It isn't rocket science. Check my Twitter, look at the dates I posted, and you'll notice the gist. Yes this is an edge but not the entire edge. How fast can you sift through 15 time frames? How long does it take you to fill out your order ticket? Your Fibonacci time extensions with 5 EMA's and Bollinger Bands aren't helping you. They're lagging. If they work for you, great. In my experience, they hindered my visibility.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Pro Tip #9**: *Yes statistics are highly applicable to trading. Patterns* ***do*** *work. All patterns do is tell you WHEN to enter/exit, and how many shares. Humans will never think differently of money. Be the frontrunner of the market's emotions. Nobody remembers the indecisive leader. Risk taking is a commonality amongst leaders. Trading requires courage and it's O.K. to show a bit of confidence as long as you also have the humility  to admit when you're in a bad trade.* ***(Notice how I didn't put, ""wrong"". You're only ""wrong"" when you deviate from a proven strategy.)***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ProTip #10:** *Risk management is 24/7. I've never heard anyone mention this but think about it a little bit. Having financial obligations can become stressful regardless of how you earn your income but its far more stressful while running a business. Not just any business, but a business where you can go to work on your A-game, do every single last thing right, trade without emotion etc... and still walk away with less money than what you came to work with. Meanwhile somebody who JUST started trading made a 4 figure profit not knowing what the heck the difference between* [ETB, HTB, or NTB](https://imgur.com/a/L0BO9oC)*. Think of it like this, a JV high school baseball player can hit a homerun off of an MLB pitcher once.. but how will he fare at the end of the season? Traders don't predict stock prices, traders predict the outcome over hundreds of trades. People chat me asking what TO do rather than what NOT to do. You don't learn labor intensive jobs or how to fly a plane by what to do.. you learn what NOT to do to stay alive.*

&#x200B;

That's all I have. Once you have a trading plan underway and you're executing it, you don't have much time when your hobbies are cheap but I still do respond to chats/messages. I do get asked from a previous post when I'll build a website and to answer that: I'm learning how to build a site on rainy days. Can't put a definitive date on it. I will say that its coming, if you don't give up on this business in the next year or so, you'll see it. What I plan on putting on there:

1. RiskReward Calculators
2. Position size Calculators
3. EV Calculator
4. Dictionary with examples

I just don't want some generic WordPress site. I want my website to be stellar and a great resource for aspiring traders. Something I didn't have learning this business. I want it to be something I'd consider a staple in a trader's resources. Perhaps one day it will be referenced on this sub frequently.

FAQ:

1. **""How do you prepare for a trading day?""** I get behind the computer about 20 minutes before the bell. Reason being: *""If you study long. You'll study wrong""*. If the chart isn't grabbing my attention and gets me excited, then I flick to the next ticker. I don't even know the companies I trade half the time nor do I care about a news report some journalist wrote. Also there is no magic news outlet that lets you know about ""Major events that affect stock prices"". If there was, I wouldn't be here because we're all subscribed to the same edge nor would I be trading my style.
2. **""What would you go back to tell yourself?""** Get more data. Save a little more, your hairline and sleep schedule will thank you. Take only perfect trades and don't feel forced to trade. There will be days you don't touch an order ticket. And days where you are busy and have tunnel vision. Next thing you know its time to shut it down for the day.
3. **""Books?"" -** I try to humble myself when answering this but off the cuff, they're all mediocre. Andrew Aziz's was ok, definitely get it, it's only a few bucks on Kindle. Just don't expect it to give you strategies BUT it will give you ideas. If you're brand new, it is good as it will teach you the common vernacular of a day trader. Mark Douglas was interesting but his YouTube seminar recordings are much better. No book, Facebook group, YouTube channel is going to be the end all be all perfect strategy. Expect losses. Don't be a one hitter quitter after suffering a few tiny losses/paper cuts. Stick to it. Most books will help you familiarize yourself with the common vocabulary amongst traders and will hint ideas. It's your job to formulate the strategy and template for research.
4. **""What is your background?""** I was a logistics planner for a major oilfield services company. Later I then became a data/buyer analyst so yes, data analytics/research was a **2nd** language for me entering trading. I did have that upper hand and did shave off months if not years for me.
5. **""What is a normal day for you?""** I'm always done trading after **10:30AM** Central. I will hold onto a trade until right before the bell if it hasn't hit either target or StopLoss by the time I leave the house but it is absolutely closed in entirety by **2:55PM** Central. After I trade, I enjoy the day. No I'm not riding around in my Lambos posting IG/Snapchat (I have neither) stories of my profits with my private jet waiting on a runway trying to sell an **$7** eBook or a **$100** membership (HINT HINT). I grill/cook, read, workout, ride my motorcycle, attack my other sources of income (small businesses I'm building), hit the driving range, shoot guns, etc. I live in Texas. Life is cheap and fun here.
6. **""How did you discover your strategy?""** I bought TradeIdeas premium, went through all of their computerized backtesting patterns, tested them. Then did what I mentioned earlier... Tried to find correlations in metrics. It distilled the trades to a strict criteria and here I am. I post on average 4-5 tickers on my watchlist. 7 max. I do not like spreading my attention thin across multiple tickers. I do not recommend buying TradeIdeas, it does have lots of bugs.
7. **""What did you do/How did you get started?""** Was a data analyst, was good at research and applied it to trading. My incentive was, ""I could have made more money trading rather than sitting in 2+ hours of roundtrip traffic and 9 hours in an office. The data is there. Everybody sees the same charts all over the world. There are ways to make this possible""
8. **""What is your % return?""** *(Not a fun question since a trading account is not an index or investment account. Intraday traders do not measure performance in %)* I trade to make money AND pay myself, so my equity curve will look like a small loss or small gain after I pay myself. **% return?** I measure my account's performance in [Sharpe Ratio](https://imgur.com/a/3ZWOpx0) and Risk Units. My Sharpe Ratio is **\~1.85**. While I yield roughly **.8 - 1 R** per trading day. Some weeks I make **10R**. Some weeks **I lose 2R**. Yeah one week I might make $2,500. But the next week I might lose $300. The following week my strategy will yield $0 and the last week I might make $1,000. Some weeks suck. Some weeks are great. But overall. Just shy of 1R per trading day. Some days I'm super busy taking trade after trade. Some days I'll shut it down after 5 minutes without even filling out an order ticket. Some days I won't even see the open because there is no edge for me.. **Keywords... ""For me"".**
9. **""Is <insert sum of money here> enough to start trading?""** Depends on where you live. Are you restricted to PDT? If not then how much are you obligated to expenses? **I live in Texas. Things are cheap here.** If you live in NYC or The Bay Area your expenses will be astronomical compared to mine. **A $30,000 account is totally doable for a single Texan with low monthly expenses.** Now if you're in California or New York? I'm sure you'll fall below 25k if you have 1 bad month. Also depends on if you have other sources of income or a full/part time job. I encourage every trader and aspiring trader to have multiple sources of income, don't rely solely on trading. Not just for the sake of mitigating pressure but also for sanity. If you have a family to provide for, I don't know what that's like, you never know when Little Johnny is going to randomly pick up Trombone lessons for a school program/play while little Suzie needs transmission work in her car because a simple solenoid went out. $1,700 later.
10. **""Why do you need so many monitors?""** **I use 3 for trading**. The 4th is for music. The other 2 are useless while trading. That's for trading though. When I made the decision to go full time, I knew I was about to go off the chain with research. And sifting between spreadsheets, a platform to see multiple timeframes for a pattern to backtest. My attention span is short, I'll lose my train of thought before I open the other tab to input data. But the main reason was for research. It's such a time saver and is a headache repellant when doing research while everything is laid out in front of you. Now that I have a system. I'll most likely be treating myself to 2 ultrawides for Christmas.

As always, thank you to everybody who takes time out to message me and letting me know some people read these and show appreciation. I would say, ""Good luck"" but there is no luck in trading. Just statistics. Remember that!

**In conclusion:** Yes. Full time trading is possible, depending where you live/monthly expenses and obligations. You're more likely to become a profitable trader than a professional athlete. There is a level of uncertainty each day, perhaps each week, doubtful each month, and definitely not each year. If I ever want a raise, I just consult my business plan and financials, then decide if I can handle it mentally. If you have medical issues, get a part time job for the benefits. If you're healthy, just be careful.

&#x200B;

All the best!

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Market faded off again and yesterday.  Trading was choppy and most gaps faded hard and some never rebounded. Today is likely to be a tough day as we are breaking back under our moving averages after confirming resistance. Right now I consider us stuck in a range from around 339 and 319 on SPY. We could fall back to 319 or we could just chop around in this range while we try to break over the moving averages and make another run. The election is coming up and things could be a bit indecisive until we get the results. Trump also got the rona, and that could cause some fear. Many options. I will wait and see if the market can find a direction, look for stocks trading outside of the market and if things get dicey, I look for UVXY for opportunities. If you are new, this could be a good day to sit out and watch. Good luck out there.

1. This annotation is where the anchored volume by price starts. This indicator starts here because this is the lowest point before the reversal and continuation of the trend higher.
2. This area shows two blue Raindrops forming before the next big move higher back in August. A blue Raindrop is a volume based doji and typically signals consolidation before the next move higher. As you can see, this same exact setup formed in late September.
3. This volume shelf is created by the anchored volume by price and shows quite a few shares holding at this level, creating a base for price to move up as supply dries up.

Given that price fluctuates within the range of several ticks quick often even on small time frames, wouldnât my win rate be decent if I trade like this?

SPY has broke back over the 50 day moving average, this does not mean we are all the way out of the clear yet but things are starting to look good again. My main focus will be on select gappers and 2nd day plays which there are PLENTY of (too many to list). As always, if you have any questions, message me or shoot me an email. Good luck trading

**Notes:** I saw some comments asking about WWR and why it wasn't on the list yesterday. I saw WWR yesterday, it was on my main gap list but I like to stick to my rules and I don't trade anything under $5 so I did not add it. Many new traders get sucked into the whole penny stock hype because their accounts are small and honestly they don't know how to position size and many don't know how to trade. People often see penny stocks make huge percentage moves and they get FOMO. They think oh this stock jumped 100% and for some reason they think they would have made tons of money, in fact it's the opposite, it is very rare that people capture the entirety of a move on a day trade.  The reality is that these stocks often halt (either temporarily or permanently). I personally have been caught holding shares in a halted stock for over a month (LFIN) at a price of around $24 and when it opened back up on the OTC market, it opened at like 7. I came out just fine but this is just one reason of why I don't like trading manipulated stocks. The risk often outweighs the reward.

$SPI Offering at $5.40 closed on October 2. 13G filed for 5.55% stake in company by Empery Asset Management. Safe entry is under $6. This stock ran up $7+ today, and closed just under the vwap. Vwap strategy can also be used as a strategic entry to scalp profits. When this stock moves we play sympathy plays $SUNW and $PECK 

$XTNT after hours has news broke filed 13D by OrbiMed Advisors for 94.8% stake in company along with insider buys from director and 10% owners. On this news the stock ran up to $3.00 looking for continuation tomorrow. 

$XSPA at 3:00 pm was on Fox News with a pretty good contract news with airbus from London to JFK. With more than 50 locations has pivoted their business for rapid testing and plan to expand to more Airports, Airbridge and Airline Partners. They are expecting shipment tomorrow to debut their test that shows positive results in 5 minutes and negative results in little as 13 minutes. With the air travel down 57% they are looking for ways to turn this around with testing. With the White House electives testing positive for testing covid stocks are back in play. 

$WWR the stock ran today up $9+ on the company applauding the President's Executive Order to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals. The stock is running accumulating sideways we can expect to see a run up breaking news highs. 

$BOXL  for the first time in a long time this stock has closed @$2+. The stock is on many traders radar we may be able to see a run up to $3. Last PR was back on 9/28/20. Boxlight Acquires Sahara Presentation Systems for GBP 74 Million (USD 94.9 Million). With more covid cases growing in various states with proposals of lockdown for non essential business and schools, distant learning play is back. 

$OPTT  Strong close after hours. This stock ran 20% looking for continuation tomorrow big gaps to fill can see highs $1.67 - $1.78 $2+ is definitely possible. This is a sympathy play from $WWR and $CBAT. If itâs PR news from August about Ocean Power Technologies Unveils Its Subsea Battery Solution Modular Subsea Energy Storage as Part of Expanded Solutions for Ocean Electrification this can be a monster play. 

$CEI has a 3 white soldiers candlestick pattern on 4hr. Continuation pattern. Load up for overnight hold. Expected premarket/intraday runner. This stock is being heavily pumped by too traders via social media they are looking for a PT of $1.25 a conservative PT will be just under $1.00 at 0.98 due to the last run it was unable to break above $1.00. This is a stock to keep watch for merger news with Viking Energy Group.

In that time, I have been learning at a rate I find very appropriate. I am in absolutely no rush. I understand it could take over a year to really get going. I'm very willing to put in the time.

\-how to read candle-charts (and adding a couple indicators that have helped me).

It seems like youtube videos only offer me VERY basic information, or very complex information - not in between.

t3_j6sssv,Help to set myself realistic expectations,"New to posting on Reddit. Looking for some personalized advice and guidance on what to do next. 

I had all my eggs in one basket (Tesla) from last year which turned out well. I have about ~$30k cash on hand that Iâm itching to invest and would like to learn day trading. 

I started my research over a year ago and decided to try Forex over Stocks since I didnât have the capital to avoid PDT. My MBA got the better of me and my interest in DT halted. Now thatâs changed again, Iâm honestly not sure where to best start as a beginner; Forex or Stocks? Anyone have their own preferences between the two and why? 

Iâm seeing a lot about risk and reward ratio - is 1:2 the most standard and any suggestions otherwise?

Risking capital. Is it correct to say that if I donât want to risk more than 2% per trade, that a capital of ~$30k would let me trade $600 at a time? How much would you then expect to set for risk/reward from a $600 trade?

Trading platform and broker. I have the hardware set up and enjoy looking at numbers and graphs enough to know Iâll enjoy whatever platform Iâll settle for. Downside is, Iâve no idea where to start. Any suggestions for choosing a platform and broker or what I should look for specifically when I compare?

Iâm aware Iâll get varying responses and that there are other places I can look to learn. I donât want to make the mistake of jumping in too early and wiping myself out. Iâm happy to use a demo for a few months while I learn, just looking for head start and a way to set my expectations correctly from the get go.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** The plan to short the runners yesterday worked great. I hit a really nice short trade on SEDG and was out within a couple minutes. Weed stocks have also had some movement, yesterday TLRY also gave so really nice long trades, I have been watching it for a long time due to the short interest and how bad it has been beaten down.  SPY slightly gapping up pre market and IWM has been on a tear which is good for small and mid caps. Since price action has been so strong, today I will focus on regular gaps. Today is Friday, so there could be some profit taking, be aware of that while holding positions. Next week AA kicks off earnings season and we should see some decent gaps in the next few weeks. Good luck trading, have a good weekend.

**Notes:** I'm working on a new video about why you are losing at trading and some tips to remedy it. Should be out in a week or less if I can get the time. I'll also do a live pre market stream hopefully next week where you all can ask me questions about stocks before the open. I'll get a mic this weekend and try and set everything up. I'll release the date a couple days in advance. If anyone has any questions, email me or shoot me a message.

$COHN: Purely technical play, 3 white soldiers on the daily, macd crossover on 4 hour, 5 green buy dots on 45 min. Green buy on quarterly. First resistance at $30 next is all the way at $140!!! 

$CTEK: CynergisTek (NYSE:CTEK), a leading cybersecurity firm helping more than 1,000 healthcare facilities navigate emerging security and privacy issues, today announced that Fairview Health Services, one of Minnesota's largest health systems, has joined the growing CTEK managed services client base. With Stimulus money about to go to hospitals and healthcare, many hospitals will be looking to follow Fairview and invest in cyber security for their databases. PT: $2.60-$3

SWING ALERT: $CEI if you're not already in from prior alert. Update for those who are. I added on at 1.20 for the overnight swing. Will add more if thereâs more dip at 4am but I dont see it. Anything is possible. Looking for a premarket gap over 1.45 to continue retracing to 2+. Could go parabolic if the run continues into the market open with minimal profit-taking. Will take profits at 1.70-1.80 and let the rest run. Recent highs of 2.80+ golden crossover on 4hr. Bullish. ð¤ð¤ð

SWING ALERT: $ITRM added on at .97 in anticipation of the continuation of this bullish sentiment. Morning Doji star candlestick pattern on the daily chart. Confirmation of reversal to an uptrend. I will load up premarket after speculating if a DBR occurs. (Dip Before Rip) my initial PT has been 1.05 for a conservative gain. Shedding some profit unless the gap blows past it. Next PT is 1.60-1.65 taking profits and letting some ride to see out full retracement over $2. If the run is parabolic I will sit on my hands let it run its course and profit at the top. ð¤ð¤ð

$FUBO a new IPO listed today, looking to be a competitor of Netflix and Hulu. Stock is still extremely cheap at only $10.50 roughly. Big-name money going here for long term investment

EUR gained a little bit more than 1% last week despite the infections rising and the Covid cases increasing as well

GBP had an up and down week and this week BOJO will be giving a speech on Brexit probably to hold the GBP higher but there's nothing right with a strong sterling. Let's see this week

$PVL, $SNMP, $OAS, $RIG: With oil and gas heating up (no pun intended) as winter rapidly approaches, these few seem to be primed for a run based on the chart. Some have already pulled off of their bottoms including SNMP, but others are still sitting at their bottom, like the remaining 3 here. These four however look ready to pop for new local highs. 

$PVL price target: $1.30, $SNMP price target: $1.15, 

$OAS price target: .90, $RIG price target $1.40 

$EDNT: Christmas and Hannukkah are also near, so toy manufacturing companies are going to start heating up again. This one specifically looks like itâs bottomed out on the daily and is good for a swing. Also a double bottom here! 

Price Target: Looking to retest $4 for a breakout 

$YRCW: Trucking/Freight company, with holidays and winter coming soon, these trucking companies also get attention. This one in particular received a $700 million loan from none other than the US Treasury in July! Talk about too big to fail? This monthly chart looks like itâs in play and if thatâs the case there are gaps to $150. Watch it close as trucking heats up for Christmas. 

$IMRN: Before closing on a Friday, IMRN broke out of itâs descending wedge looking to break resistance at $8.85 for a gap up. 

$SPAQ: Merger coming up at the end of the month looking for a pop back into the $20 range before itâs announced. 

$NBY: Due to Covid, Amazon Prime Day wasnât held in July. It is instead on 10/13-10/14. With amazon prime day usually giving exclusive discounts to itâs members, this one is on our radar. This stock sells itâs eye drug on Amazon with no prescription needed. Looking for a pop back over $1.60. 

$SSNT: Looking for a reversal with gaps to $6. Bullish divergence on the MACD. 

$TSLA: Higher price. Will be posting its Q2 2020 financial results on Wedesday 10/21. After the closing bell, the company will release a brief advisory link. Turned bullish on 10/7 and has resistance at $440. Keep an eye out for that to become support. Would not be surprised if it has a run to $471. Price Target: $471.

**Gap Downs:** BYND, EBS, GOSS, LOOP

**Outlook/Game Plan:** QQQ gapping up pre market while SPY is  inside yesterdays range. Not nearly as many stocks gapping pre market as there has been lately. The market is getting overbought and a small pullback/consolidation would be nice because so many stocks are overbought and getting extended. AA kicks off earnings tomorrow night and in the following weeks we should see some decent opportunities as more and more companies report. I never hold through earnings, I trade the reactions. My thought process when trading a runaway market is to trade with the trend until the trend shows signs of reversing. Many times when the market is strong, stocks will make incredible moves to the upside and many times people won't enter because they think the market might pull back or they want to short and end up get burned. FSLY was an example of a very strong stock that printed a reversal pattern on the daily (Head & Shoulders) but since the market was so strong, FSLY just resumed trend and is now back at all time highs, NET yesterday had another strong move,  These are examples of some strong plays and if the market stays this way, we will see some more. Solar stocks have also been on a massive run, all courtesy of the bull market. So although I believe the market could use a pull back, I'm not sure when we will get one so my outlook remains bullish but I stay vigilant when managing my positions in case in case they pull the rug out from underneath us. Good luck out there.

# Gameplan:

Happy turnaround Tuesday folks! Premarket activity is well within the upper portion of yesterday's range, so why am I bearish today?

1.) Yesterday was a wide range bar

2.) Yesterday had ending volume (higher volume than the days prior)

3.) We've gapped higher 4 days in a row

4.) We're overbought on the 60 & 120 min charts

5.) The NDAQ is into resistance

6.) Many retail traders have likely FOMO'd their way into the market over the past couple of days. They will be the first to sell when they realize they just bought the top.

So do we just blindly short the market today with a stop at the high of day? I suppose you could. You'll probably get 1-2R on your money. 

I prefer to look for a bearish setup intraday with the expectation that we'll see continuation. This way I can: limit my risk, take bigger size, capitalize on a larger timeframe move with more capital. These are the days you can get that 5-6R trade. Just remember, if you're wrong, take your stop. Trading is an odds game and you'll never be right 100% of the time.

Good luck today folks.

AA will kick off earnings season tonight AMC and we should see some decent moves as many stocks during earnings season make huge moves and usually there are some decent opportunities.

t3_jbu72e,"If you day trade in your Roth IRA, can you please help?","I thought brokers do not set rules on how one can trade in her Roth IRA, but I personally found that between my two Roth IRA accounts (similar $30K+ value) at Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, they are managed extremely differently. And it is super annoying at Fidelity.

Basically, it's the same high level rules -- no shorting stocks; on options, only CSP or CC's, etc.

However, at **Fidelity**, even after I sold my positions (all liquidated), the fund for me to day trade with did not increase (see the screenshot linked below). Which means right now, I don't have my full account to trade with. I also posted a screenshot of Fidelity's Definitions, which do not make sense to me -- If I'm a PDT margin account, why should there be any difference between Overnight buying power and Intraday buying power?

As far as I can tell, I do not see that problem with **TD Ameritrade** \-- I can trade as many times as I want as soon as I sold my positions.

# Gameplan:

Yesterday we saw them come into the support we had on the board at **347** not once, not twice, but thrice. At the end of the day, they had one final rally in the northern direction before closing in a weak fashion. The triple bottom at yesterday's lows also created what's called a ""poor low"". Outside of a major news event, a poor low and weak close means a gap down the following morning which is exactly what we're seeing today. I've taken around 5 of these trades over the past month and have a 100% win rate. Obviously, one should be careful when taking these and size down as it's an overnight hold and anything can happen overnight.

After 4 consecutive days of gapping higher, this sort of pullback is healthy. We have a ton of great support underneath us and I'll look to lean in on any good long setups around these numbers.

At the open, we have to remember that there have been overnight players shorting the market. We also have to remember that the market is trending UP (both long and short term). The possibility is there to fade the open with an entry at the first 1m bar to make a new high, with a stop below the low of day. Target should be 1R or any prominent pivot on the premarket chart.

t3_jc33y6,Can someone with consistent profitability in ultra volatile small caps please help explain the appeal?,"I'm a relatively new day trader - been at this full time since late 2019, but I've been a longer term trader since the late 2000's. 

I tend to trade mid-high volatility momentum names with high volume like NIO, NET, SPCE, TSLA, FSLY to name some recent ones. A 1 - 2% gain is a solid base hit for me, but I've let positions ride for 15%+ moves (1/2 out then trailing stop). With 4x margin I'm often trading positions well into six figures, so a base hit can be several thousand in profit. Sometimes I get shaken out, but most my strategies are breakout or bailout, so I avoid taking big haircuts. My P&L is a steady uptrend with some months choppier than others. 

Now, with the flood of new traders and hype around small caps this year (granted we had some wild moves, esp this summer), I'm seeing even seasoned traders shift towards small caps and I'm starting to feel like a conservative trader. 

I honestly don't understand the appeal. If you're a serious trader and you're in this for the long haul, I don't know how you can look at 30, 50, 80% moves within minutes and see that as a viable stock to trade. Even if you're in the small club who can pull it off, who wants that kind of stress? I can think of a couple well known traders who have been in the small cap game for years (who may or may not make more money selling courses than trading), and even with years of experience, you can tell how stressed out they get trading. Yes, all trading has stress, but holding a position in a halt going down isn't exactly the same as stopping out for a 0.5% loss. 

One argument I often hear is that high volatility small caps are good for growing small accounts. I'd argue the opposite. If you have a $30k account on 4x margin and you capture on average 0.5% gain every day, you're making \~$150K before tax. If you think you're above that as a new trader, you're probably going to learn humility the hard way. On the other hand, if you have a $30K account and you traded a name like STAF today, you could've easily lost 10-20% within seconds - enough to put you below PDT requirements. 

I'm not trying to bash small cap traders, and if it works for you, more power to you. I am constantly learning and growing as a trader and I want to understand the appeal from people who have been in the game a long time. Why do you trade small caps, and what downsides to you see in trading larger cap and less volatile names?",5,0.79,1602821883,"[['FSLY', 1], ['STAF', 1]]",FSLY,84.0,77.1500015258789

**FRIDAY WITH A MARKET THAT HAS BEEN SLOW THE PAST COUPLE DAYS! BE CAUTIOUS!** 

$LYL: 35 million shares traded hands today in volume and only 5 million available shares in the float due to other 6 million being insider held. Rotated so many times with close above $2 after hours. Twitter influencers calling for this to gap up tomorrowâs premarket with a price target of **$3**. Be careful! Already up 75% today! 

$STAF: STAF ran up until about 9:30 AM and then started consolidating. Chart looks ready to try the high of **$3.30** again tomorrow. Watch for breakout over that price, if it faces resistance there again it will act as a double topâ¦ 

$FAMI: Forming a pennant and sitting at the bottom of the pennant currently with 4 hour MACD about to cross over the 0 line. Should test the top of the pennant again soon at **$1.50**. Over 2 million in volume today. The last two times that happened the price ran the next day. Looking for a bullish move tomorrow to reflect that increased volume. Looks like a PR may drop tomorrow based on how the chart and volume look. 

$INO: Watch for FDA news due out very soon. Stock currently around $12 a share. Extremely oversold and a ton of shorts in this name. Could triple once FDA lifted. Under the 200, 150, and 50 moving averages and has support at the $11.65 area. ***Swing*** price target: $30.00 

$PIXY: Made its first run today and then started consolidating after touching $3. Looks like itâs ready to make another run tomorrow. Keeping price target the same at **$3.50** 

$AMRN: Amarinâs VASCEPA (Icosapent Ethyl) Found to Significantly Reduce Ischemic Events in Patients with Prior Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). Meaning their drug SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES FUTURE STROKES AND HEART ATTACKS ON PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD HEART SURGERY ALREADY. This news is huge and once the market fully digests it, I believe AMRN will see $8.

Morgan Stanley has been doing well the past few weeks. And the algo and screens say that uptrend is not going to reverse. Morgan Stanley and their one-off hedge funds have made crazy returns this year. I would hope that will correlate with the stock price.

t3_jds657,PLAYBOOK FOR 10/19/2020,"**PLAYBOOK FOR 10/19/2020** 

***STARTING LINEUP: (PRE-MARKET POTENTIAL)*** 

$WIMI: Huge SEC 6K filed on Friday Evening! Anticipating the company to drop a PR on this news. WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. establishes a subsidiary to accelerate the development of the Artificial Intelligence algorithm and cloud computing services and announces the resignation and re-appointment of the director and CEO! This is a low float stock that ran to $30+ in July. Stocks love to run off of new CEO PRâs as well. Conservative PT is $10-12 on this one! Earlier, the better on this one! 

***STOLEN BASE: (SCALP PLAY)*** 

$HTZ: On a Friday, HTZ had a BILLION in trading volume. News broke on the company securing commitments of $1.65 Billion in Debtor-In-Possession Financing. Even though it reached a billion in trading volume, looking for continuation here. Usually, when HTZ runs on a Friday, it continues much stronger on the following Monday. If the price can hold over $2.85 for a 30-minute candle (open and close over $2.85), there is a strong likelihood of a target price of $6.85. If the price fails to hold over this key resistance level, there is a strong likelihood of a selloff. Pay close attention! 

FASTBALL***: (SHORT SWING PLAY)*** 

$PIXY: Oversold on the daily with an RSI of 20.52. Just had an offering at $3 per share, diluting the total shares by 10%. Dropped from $3.60 on that news 9 days ago. It looks like itâs ready to rebound. There is a gap to $3.15, which we can easily see on a solid reversal here at $2.60. It should be a decent 20% move. 

$SAVA: Way Oversold. Possible morning star on the 4 hour. At EMA 100 as support. 5% move to close and continuation into the week to retrace back to $12+. 

***LONG BALL: (DECEMBER (LONG) PLAY)*** 

$CTXR: Citius Pharmaceuticals is a small pharma company creating THREE new products for growing markets. Mino-Lok is due to have Phase 3 data reporting in December or earlier. The chart looks primed for a breakout too. Mino-Lok is an antibiotic lock solution used to treat patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections. Currently, it is only valued at \~$55 Million at $1.11 a share. Mino-Lok fills an unmet need in the CRBSI space with potential annual sales of $500 Million, which means the company is significantly undervalued if the Phase 3 results are positive. We can easily see $5-8 conservatively as the company gains recognition in this unmet market. 

$SELB: Strong close in the after-hours on Friday. Looking for continuation on the radar with its director buying 3,185,394 shares at $1.71. Director bought shares on 10/6, 10/9, and 10/15. It might be a great swing play here as well. I would look out for news here with all of the insider buying. It usually represents a bigger picture coming into focus! Price Target $4.65

t3_jerz89,Failing? Please help. Tradovate,"Hi I have some prior experience losing money on the markets, and recently started with Tradovate. I switched over from TD Ameritrade's Think or Swim, their commissions were pretty high, but I still use their charts.

Although this is less than a month data on Tradovate, I had similar results on TD. I was UP 200 dollars gross in TD, but DOWN 1500 in futures commisions.

I use a bracket order for take profit 15 ticks and hard stop loss for 9 ticks, I use footprint, standard deviation, candles, and heikin ashi. If I'm coming up on resistance or see the footprints acting up, I will take profit early before the 15 tick target so it doesn't turn into a loser, which is the right move maybe half of the time. I've tried moving my stop loss up as it goes in my favor, however I will usually get stopped out that way.

What is wrong with my strategy? How do you day traders work in commissions to your trading plan? Will I ever break this threshold?

**Gap Downs:** CVNA, IBM,  STLD, SYF,

**Possible 2nd Day Plays**: SMMC

**Outlook/Game Plan:** The market ended up fading off yesterday again which I was prepared for and ended up taking a nice short on NIU. SPY getting closer to the 50 day and 20 day moving averages which  are both around the 339 level. There's still a small gap that hasn't been filled around 330, so we could pull back further in the near future. All we can do is trade accordingly and follow price action. Right now my main focus is earnings plays and it will remain that way until earnings is over. Good luck out there.

Often new traders see these huge moves and think for some reason had they saw it, they would have just traded it better than anything they have before and capture the whole trade.

$WEI âSaw explosive gains, early with some of its highest volumes all year. Whatâs important to note is that yesterday, WEI stock hit a fresh 52-week low. Tuesday, with no apparent catalyst, shares of WEI rallied from $0.85 to highs of $4.68 before the lunch hour. Perhaps, FOMO will kick in early Premarket and sell off by 7:30.

$TSLA -  Sell-off continues on the downtrend, Wall Street's revenue consensus for Tesla during the first quarter is $8.276 billion, and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $8.433 billion.

$AAPL-  Wow, what a roller-coaster, but it did find support at the 50 ma. It was showing signs of a possible cup handle, and investors took a chance. Still, I would say we are on a downtrend and anything could make it drop to 38.2% on the Fibonacci scale ($108.62). Waiting for uptrend confirmation on tomorrow's candle.

4. This area represents the confluence between the Alphatrends anchored VWAP from the âhandoffâ and the âvolume shelfâ which is an area where a lot of shares are holding.

t3_jgruqk,ToS @ TS vs ATP @ Fidelity,"Morning everyone,

I wanted to reach out and see how folks are feeling about the current state of Thinkorswim vs ActiveTraderPro. TL;DR: how are fills/execution speeds at ToS?

Iâm currently with AllyInvest, purely out of convenience as I had some banking there and the fees were low. Though time and time again theyâve let me down with trading outages, slow data, bad fills, and god awful customer service. (It seems anytime thereâs something going wrong their chat is just down. Iâve only been able to get through to someone once, though she ended chat when I went to piss for a few minutes citing inactivity)

So Iâm looking to switch it up. Iâve narrowed it down to TOS or ATP as to who Iâm going to. Iâm leaning ToS but my only concern is talk of their execution speeds being shit since they swapped to no-commissions. Is this still an issue anyone is noticing? Both have good desktop and web platforms (web is important to me as I do a lot of trading while at work where I cannot download the full platform). ToS charges for OTC which sucks, but I canât even find confirmation on TDâs site whether or not they do, their site is pretty awful to navigate imo. Though I wonât be doing much OTC Iâd like for it to be an option without getting cut at the knees by a $6.95 fee per trade. 

Iâd be fine going to either but prefer the UI at ToS. Iâve got my long term stuff at Schwab, so theyâd be reunited eventually anyhow. But if the fills arenât great, Iâm happy to trade at Fidelity. How is your experience?

Edit: just realized I meant to put ToS @ TD not TS in the title. After proofreading and everything. Damn.",2,1.0,1603474760,"[['TS', 2], ['UI', 1], ['TD', 1]]",TS,10.289999961853027,9.569999694824219
t3_jgessn,An update on my arbitrary triangles that have no meaning whatsoever.,"Other than the fact it happened at 9:30, it would have been literally impossible for anyone to give you a better chart and idea of what would happen today than the one I provided. We snapped above the exact level I told you was the key, consolidated, retested it to the tic, and than ripped to the exact line and stopped on a dime for the last couple hours of the day.

 I'm going to post 3-5 more times  over  the next week or 2 and  if enough people see that I'm, not making up anything and the concepts I'm showing are key to understanding price action, I'll keep doing it. If not, no biggie. I learned a key concept from someone else and spent 20k hour developing it. I thought I would share some it but the response was ridiculous before it all happened in a manner that almost eliminates the possibility of randomness. For tomorrow or maybe next week, watch:

Watch 283.50ish on the QQq's and 116 on AAPL. If they hold in the AM we should rip 3 points higher on the q's tomorrow and that should be the low for AAPL pre earnings. I'd guess it's at 123-25 by the time they report so if you plan on playing earnings, I'd suggest buying it tomorrow rather than wait as long as it holds 116 early tomorrow.

Bonus call-285.65 on the DIA's should give you a short term top or at least a pause if we hit it tomorrow. I'd show the charts but I don't feel like being ridiculed right now. The chart I am posing just shows what happened today using the same chart with the same lines I got laughed at yesterday.

$NXTD âIn the last quarter, NXTD reported a profit of $1.81 million. Nxt-ID Inc. also saw revenues increase to $2.48 million. In addition, NXTD has a free cash flow of $0.61 million as of 06-2020. The companyâs EBITDA came in at $0.26 million, which compares well with its peers. â Sitting on 61.8% on the Fibonacci, still a beast and looking for the 0% to find support $0.64

$GILD got approval FDA approval AH. Closed under all the MA (50, 100,150,200), AH moved up to $64.52. 52 week high was $85

$AAPL â Made a new low today and ended $115.75 under the 20 and 50MA, but AH news came out confirming the iPhone 13 is everything you wanted the iPhone 12 to be and more, making consumers doubt whether to scrap iPhone 12 and wait for the next year model. Possible sell of tomorrow. Would not be surprised if it found resistance @ $112.57

VXRT The first lawyer who opens up the ambulance suit against them is now in prison. The deadline for lawsuits against the company is tomorrow. Stock is bottomed on support and curling with macd  bullish divergence. The immediate price target is $7

$ABUS holds the patent for rna tech that Moderna is using in their vaccine candidate. As the vaccine comes closer to being born and distributed, ABUS will either reap the rewards of royalties or will get bought out altogether. The stick is curling up off support and looks to be heading toward $3.35 short term, or an easy 15% gain for anyone looking for a solid smaller return

$VISL the dip today was nice entry for this swing. Bullish reversal pattern. White soldier.

$UONE some more confluence for UONE. On 4hr MA21 and EMA20 crossing bullish over EMA/MA50 which indicates short-term uptrend confirmed which gives a fully bullish MA/EMA fan.

t3_jhi5vw,Beginner in need of advice for countering possible loss?,"So I hold 1000 shares of SPAQ at 14.25 (stock has dropped to 10.48 pre-merger). Honesty even breaking even would make me happy at this point. Would it be wise to take a short position from 10.48 to cover my ass in case this falls more? And if it doesn't and it goes up, at least it's cancelled out?

t3_jip5tr,How to Day Trade or Swing Trade on Days like Today,"New to day trading and probably more suited for swing trading or if we are being honest, probably having someone else manage my money.  Sadly, in my month of trying to swing trade, I only had the guts to pull the trigger once and profited $200.

&#x200B;

On days like today with AXP and Disney and all other stocks down, what do you do? Obviously with AXP or Disney or MSFT, etc you have 3% and 4% down staring right at you. So you think it could be an easy trade or swing.  

What held me back was well, crap, it went down 900 at one point today and ended up down over 600, no reason why it may not go back down big tomorrow.  With new cases, it may just keep trending downward like February and March.

&#x200B;

So, do you just sit on the sideline in cash and wait for your pitch?  Or do you take an AXP for example  at lets say $96.25, buy it and if it pops up to 96.75, sell it.     Or Disney at $123 and flip it at $124.

&#x200B;

or maybe the day trader types probably had a field day making good money today buying in and out such as buying AXP at 96.25, selling at say 96.75, buying back in at 96.50 and then selling it again at 96.65?  (numbers are just picked as examples) Is that how it was done today by the traders?

The reason for that is since we had a very big red day today I feel like there will be a lot of buying pressure tomorrow and it seems that the bulls are not giving up on Snapchat yet. So I would advise to take some profits and see if a better opportunity presents itself in the oncoming days. Happy trading!

$GRIL: Up over 20% after hours on Friday to $1.186 after releasing news that Muscle Maker acquires one of its previously franchise-owned locations in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. The location did $1.1 million in revenue last year alone, so this location is key to their future business model. A full breakout measured move of pennant breakout puts the stock at $2.40 which will fill the gap from September 10.

$ZYNE: Zynerba has a meeting upcoming with the FDA for transdermal cannabis cream: Zygel. Remember we buy the hype and sell the news. This is a swing with the potential to see $7.50-8.00 if approved by the FDA. The company is expected to meet with the FDA again by the end of the year and stop looks primed to move based upon that meeting.

$RKT: Rocket has earnings upcoming on 11/10/20. The last ER they ran up to $35. Currently in a squeeze on the 1-hour chart. This will be a slow and steady gainer until ER so manage your stop loss appropriately.

$NBY: Masks are being talked about everywhere being more and more essential due to more spiking of Covid-19. Local governments are calling for a federal mandate. Currently trading at the bottom of a repetitive range of .71 and .84. Even if no breakout, a move to .84 is a good 16.5% return.

$CEI: Most are holding or swinging this into the upcoming merger news with Viking Energy. Recently broke out of a descending wedge into a pennant and now is about to break out of that pennant. Looks like it wants to test the old support line of the major trend as new resistance which would put the stock at $1.23. If CEI can break through the resistance and get back onto the old trend line, the next breakout target is $2.50.

(ALSO WATCH OTHER EV STOCKS THIS WEEK: $SPI, $CBAT, $PECK, $SUNW)

$NWGI: A gaming stock with a major roll in online sports betting. Many didnât know what to expect as NFL players began getting Covid. Now that we see the games just getting delayed a couple of days and players recovering well, NWGI is looking like a strong playback to $2.30.

$DSS: Ran AH on Friday, DSS made a profit of $3.6 million on its revenue of $20.2 million in last year.

Earnings in such uncertain time also creates more expensive contracts with VXX being way up. Much of it can be attributed to the volatility in the market.

# Gameplan:

When talking about signs of a reversal, you don't get much better than we got yesterday:

* Wide range, high volume ending bars on the 5m, 15m, and 30m charts
* Break of channel followed by a quick snapback on the 1h
* Strong close

Here's one for your notes... Anytime you see trending action within a channel whether up or down, these will sometimes resolve with a melt-up or melt-down *outside* of the channel and also in the direction the channel is trending. This is exactly what we saw yesterday, it's what we saw at the SPY all-time highs, I also saw it on SNAP after their earnings last week. So what happens when we melt out of a channel? We have a tendency to go to the other side of the channel, and we tend to get there very quickly. **344.40** is my target today. 

We're set to open slightly higher this morning. We can go as low as **339.25** and still be bullish. Below that and I don't like it as much. One possible trade opportunity is to play the breakout of **341** with a stop somewhere above **339** depending on how much risk you want to take on. The target is the top of the channel @ **344.40**. I'll feel even better about this trade if we can breakout earlier rather than later. Before 10:15 would be ideal. We should really breakout and go from this area so finding acceptance anywhere under **341** would have me cutting my loss.

Good luck today folks!

t3_jivwzh,Lightspeed or ThinkorSwim?,"I average 1 - 5 trades a day, usually within first hour or so of open, sometimes letting partial positions ride longer. It's important that I'm able to get in and out fast because I often trade around the first 15m of open when volatility is high.

I've used both ToS and Lightspeed, and I go back and forth over which one to stick with. I wrote down some pros/cons for both that some of you may find helpful. I also hope to open up a discussion about which one is preferable for serious day trading. 

I really like LS but it can be crushing when you manage to go $400 ""green"" on a choppy day, but then calculate commissions and you're actually red. That said, on ToS around open I've had several experiences with orders (sometimes well into 6 figures) just floating around for seconds or even minutes only to find out I had been filled at a terrible price, missed the move, lost money, and customer service will do nothing about it. 

ToS Pros: 

* No commissions
* Active Trader is as good as it gets for day trading as far as free platforms go IMO
* Same day ACH deposits/withdrawals (usually instant if it's during trading hours)
* Solid charts
* Customer service is usually pretty responsive (though their helpfulness is a mixed bag)

ToS Cons:

* Painfully laggy within first 5m of open some days (most days in my experience)
* Not many shorts available
* A history of outages, sometimes lasting hours or days as we've seen in 2020
* Even when working perfectly, will be about a second behind a direct access broker (tested this several times at different points in the day w/ LS and ToS up side by side) - sounds insignificant, but a second can be a big deal when you're trading the open

Lightspeed Pros:

* Direct access routing = super fast trades
* Reliable - have yet to experience any lag or outages
* Lots of shorts available
* Super customizable, especially when it comes to hotkeys and hot buttons
* Ability to get rebates when you add liquidity w/ certain exchanges 
* While complex, one of the easier platforms to learn compared to other names in direct access routing (at least from what I've demoed)

Lightspeed Cons:

Yesterday we saw some strange trading. The Nasdaq closed well in the positive while the S&P 500 and the DOW closed in the red.

Markets appear very choppy at the moment but the trend is still certainly down. The SPY had been trading in a down-trending channel and has fallen through the bottom of that channel in the premarket.

Futures are pointing towards a bloody open. Down more than 1% at writing.

t3_jkehq8,Painful Loss Today - Lesson Learned,"I've been scalping options everyday for about half a year now and wanted to share a bad loss I had today to get it off my chest but also to give back to the community with a lesson I learned.

During my pre-market scan, which is limited to stocks with large options liquidity, NFLX turned up with a bullish indication that met my criteria. A few minutes into open I jumped into the trade around $490 but unfortunately there wasn't much volume and it didn't look like it was going to go in my direction. That's no problem as, like any other viable daytrading strategy, there aren't guarantees. Well I wasn't quite ready to bail as the price action was still tame and my *mental* stop wasn't triggered.

After about 15 seconds more of waiting something didn't seem right. The charts weren't moving and the price wasn't either. The volume was low, but not *that* low. I'd daytraded crypto long before this and learned some tickers have a 'personality' to them but NFLX was not one to act this way. I figured my charting software was lagging for a second, so I switched back and forth to another stock, which had no problem, before seeing nothing changed. Then I realized something was wrong. I quickly googled NFLX now to see the price had dropped to 485, well below where I would have gotten out at.

I quickly closed and reopened Streetsmart Edge (Schwab) and saw that in fact the market moved strongly against me while the software was crapping out. Of course, I sucked it up and after a few moments of hesitation sold my position. I took a $2000 loss, which is way beyond my (rough) limit of $300.

Am I bitter? Yea a little, but I'm also glad I had this lesson. You might think what I took away from this was to always set a stop loss and, yea I probably should. But the thing is, options move in crazy swings and depending on liquidity the spreads can be a bit too wide to make a stop reliable. I have enough discipline to stick to my mental stops, however.

No, the real lesson I learned is to *always remember to manage your size*. My size wasn't actually crazy despite this big loss. But, you see, the last few weeks I've been guilty of smoking mad **hopium**.

I had been on about a 12 day streak and was starting to feel larger than life. My strategy had been proving itself even before the streak but now I really felt like I was going places. In my free time I started doing mental math constantly to see what my (ridiculously) high income would be once I grew my account size to size up my trades. But I was greedy in my day dreaming. I wanted to start sizing up **now**, make big moves immediately to something my account size couldn't handle--precisely because of some freak contingency like this. I was thinking: ""Yea, my trades are good now, why shouldn't I just size up to make a $1000/day return? Yea, it's a risk but I'm on fire! This strategy I have is gold! The market's volatility won't be this high forever!""

But one move like this against me, even though it's not wholly my fault, and I would've been wiped out. Who knows? If this hadn't happened, maybe I would've sized up and wiped myself out. Or maybe I'm just coping.

Either way, stay patient, and keep your size down, friends. Also have a healthy distrust of your software...

I'm not discounting the chance for a **fierce** deadcat bounce today. So this is more of a medium-term swing trader standpoint. If you're holding overnight, it's better to be short.

# Gameplan:

The market showed us something yesterday we haven't seen in a while. Regardless of the election, it was a true change in character. Institutions are going risk-off into the election and possibly longer. Once the presidential race is determined (and both sides accept victor/defeat), we will likely see some re-balancing action back into equities. The question then becomes, will buyers step up with the current COVID situation lurking. 

I'm not here to analyze the current political situation, I'm here to read the charts, and the charts tell us we are now clearly in a downtrend. Do I believe we have further to go? I absolutely do. That being said, never discount a countertrend bounce. We have lots of folks expecting a countertrend bounce today who are looking to get short. If they short it to early, the short covering will ensue and we will see yesterday's high quicker than you can blink an eye. Be careful.

Looking at yesterday's profile, all looks good until we get to the bottom. We have HUGE volume at the end of the profile. What does this tell us? It tells us that many folks are still selling at these lower prices. Moves end when the sellers no longer want to sell and the prices begin to favor buyers. On a market profile chart, this will look like volume fading off into nothing. This is clearly not the case here and we are very likely to go lower than yesterday's low at some point in the next few days.

As a note, we're in for a *very* choppy day. If you're trading, go longer timeframe than usual and try not to let your emotions drive your decisions. As always in these markets, the sidelines are a fine place to be.

Many traders are $SHIP swingers looking for the gap up in the morning. $SHIP and $TOPS were famous for offerings. However, CEOâs release filings stating they will not be doing any offerings this season definitely calms the nerves of those burnt in the past. They have even bought back shares they once owned.

Always remember to secure profits as these run hard and fall harder. Many are targeting $1 for $SHIP. Conservative price target to get out before the crowd: $0.75. 

$UUU: Volume spiked after hours on 10/27. ACTIVIST INVESTING LLC filed a 13D ownership report with SEC for 9.9%. UUU advised they are in receipt of letter threatening shareholder action to prevent delisting from the exchange and bankruptcy. The stakeholder called for immediate action to halt any further destruction of value. Also reiterated that time is of the essence. 

$DGLY & VISL: As the riots heat up in Philadelphia and the election rounds the corner here, prepare for things to get a little heated in the cities, no matter who wins.

t3_jl39ee,Scalping - How to enter a trade,"Hi Everyone,

I've been dipping in and out of this subreddit for a while now and to be honest I've been quite critical. I feel there is a lot of miss-information flowing between new traders and not a lot of direction that will actually help people trade. This is my attempt at offering something back.

# Scalping & Why You Should Care

Every trade starts as a scalp. You're looking for a good entry and you want the market to move on side as quickly as possible. Regardless of what trading you want to do, you should learn to scalp.

Scalping is the art of reading the order flow and identifying short term momentum. It's not 1 tick 100 trades a day. Unless you're a bot or a massive player, you're expecting to make 2 - 8 ticks  (more in illiquid markets) and you're absolutely not setting a designated profit & loss taker.

# What Moves The Market

Size. For the most part, it's big players throwing a lot of money in one direction that moves the market. Their action at 1 price point might dictate the direction of the market for the next hour. More often than not, it dictates the direction until they hit someone else big who pushes it back the other way. Retail traders are just following the wave created by the big players. That is the essential part of scalping.

Have you ever wondered why the market can move so sharply in one direction for an hour and yet still close the day only a few points off where it started? That's a large player selling the market down and then maybe even the same player buying it all the way back up again. You can't predict that in a swing trade. You didn't know that player was going to turn up that day to do that. This is why scalping is an effective way of trading, because I don't care who turns up or what they do as they do something to move the market for me.

# How Do You See Big Players?

Order flow is the only way you're going to trade this effectively. I know many of you like to use charts, but you cannot do this effectively with them. Let me show you why.

Below is a trade I took today in the treasuries. On the left is ZN and the right ZB. I also have ZF off to the left, but wanted to cut down the size of the screenshot.

If you've never seen a DOM, this will look confusing. I suggest going and watching a video from John Grady on the DOM, I can't explain it better than he can. Here is an example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viBGTEGFF1k&t=238s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viBGTEGFF1k&t=238s)

The screenshot below shows you what you can't see in charts. In real time, I can see a big player finally crushing through the edge of the volume profile after 40 minutes of teasing with it. If you entered earlier, you got wiped out when the market drove up. If you were watching the order flow, you knew that was likely to happen because you could see sellers fatiguing on the edge of the profile and they needed a retracement before going back through it.

This screenshot is the essence of scalping. I don't make the trade decision, the big guy did. All I did was decide to join him for the ride.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qy2k0pfu5aw51.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=de06b04e484d67824d0b8a231658805512d0dc85

The market dropped 11 ticks very quickly from this point. That's $30 per tick. I didn't grab all of that, but I got a decent pay out.

To exit my trade I looked for the opposite conditions that lead me to join it in the first place. A big buyer stepping up to slow and halt the market fall. In this case I actually got out a bit early, but the beauty of scalping is that I can keep jumping in and out as long as I've got momentum.

You won't see that big buyer in your chart, because you won't see the 5k contracts printing in at 1 price point where they've dug their heels in. By the time you've made the decision from your chart, the market has already moved against you.

If this trade hadn't pushed any lower, I would have exited immediately. I might have taken a 1 tick loss. That means I would have been risking 1 tick to make upwards of 11.

# Closing thoughts

In my opinion, I don't believe TA really works. I don't believe it works because of what I see when I trade in the DOM and I know TA isn't showing that.

I do believe that some people have a natural gift with charts and they're essentially reading this price action through the bar jumping up and down. I'm sure it can be done, but I also believe it's a lot easier to just view the data in the DOM in the first place.

There are no indicators for what I've shown you in that screenshot. Even if there was, by the time you've checked 3 indicators you've missed that move. Jumping on that move after it's gone is dangerous. That market may have only dropped 3 ticks and rallied right up against you.

Finally, if you open a trade and it doesn't start moving your way, you didn't get the right entry. You can't get it every time and that's why we scratch trades. It doesn't have to move instantly with you, but if you can't see momentum going your way then scratch for a commission cost and move on. Wait for that big player.

I didn't make money until I forced myself to only trade when I see size on that DOM. That size only really appears during the open hours as well, so now I only trade the open 2 hours.

t3_jlp2j6,Multi Time Frame Analysis - Some important notes on analyzing all time frames and how it helps with risk management.,"Just wanted to share some brief trading notes that might be helpful.   


Multi Time Frame Analysis has been very important in my trading and analysis. There are different time frame traders for example Daily time frame traders will not care about the intraday activity like 2M or 5M, they will analyze the daily chart and just trade daily time frames.   


Understanding that there are different traders in different time frames have shaped my perspective on entries and exits by allowing me to understand where buyers and sellers are. I typically have a flexible trading grid with all time frames 2M 5M 15M 30M 1HR 4HR to identify potential areas of tops and bottoms.   


For example; The 4 HR support and resistance have been very responsive and by looking at these larger time frames can help you avoid getting stuck in a bad position by buying when reaching an area of demand where you will most likely find Hourly time frame sellers. 

  
Having your 4HR charts display 360 day period is also very helpful since it shows potential areas of resistance and supports since intraday activity will respond to resistance in the previous days or months.   


Overnight highs and lows have also been very important visual references of support / resistance.

t3_jlnnwt,Top 10 Lessons Learned from a Profitable Day Trader,"Iâll start out by saying that I am a profitable Day Trader. I aim to increase my account value by at least 1% each day - a target I hit around 80% of the time.  Iâm starting out with this because you shouldnât take advice from someone who canât manage to make a consistent profit. 

However, Iâve learned some basic lessons that might help some of you, in no particular order:

1) Do not trade SPY futures (/ES) after-hours.  There is no advantage to it, and more often than not you will lose money.

2) Do not hold a position, either in stock or options, through earnings.  The result is too unpredictable with the stock, and the options will lose tremendous value through IV reduction.

3) Stop chasing losses and/or prematurely taking profits.  Traders tend to stay in losing trades longer than they should, and exit profitable ones too early to lock in their gain out of fear.  This also goes for averaging down - donât do it.  Averaging up works a lot better, but itâs harder to do psychologically.

4) Understand your trade before you enter it.  If you buy a Stock at $50, do you know what your stop will be? Do you have the right entry?  And with options, what is your exit strategy if it goes against you?  Know what percent of your account you are willing to take as a maximum loss (1-2%), where is support/resistance, VWAP, etc. And most important - what is the market doing?

5) Learn and understand the various options strategies and when you should use them.  Some stocks have incredibly strong support - Great! Use an OTM Bullish Put Spread below support, and make sure you get 25% ROI ($5 spread between strikes = $1 credit for example).  Other stocks have very little movement? Consider a Butterfly.  Choose the right strategy for the situation.

6) Very Important - when day trading you want to be going long on stocks that have Relative Strength against SPY and short on those that have Relative Weakness.  When SPY drops during the day, notice which stocks held up.  Those are the ones you want to buy when SPY rebounds.  I can not stress enough how important and central this is to your success.

7) Donât chase someone elseâs day trade unless you analyzed it yourself.  You may miss some opportunities doing this, but youâll also prevent yourself from being trapped in a trade you didnât understand.

8) The idea you âmissed the big moveâ has no basis in reality.  ZM is up $20 so you figure you already missed the action and move on, this is a mistake.  Look at the technicals. Chances are this is still a good opportunity, especially if there is relative strength against SPY.

9) Youâre not smarter than the market. You havenât thought of something that others havenât already considered.   This type of thinking leads you to make decisions before you have technical confirmation that youâre correct.  

10) Day Traders trade what is in front of them - price action, technicals on the D1 and M5 (mainly), market conditions of that day, volume, etc.  A great trade at 10am could be a terrible idea an hour later.  You need to be nimble, to move quickly and to trade what you see at that moment.

So I mainly trade the S&P 500 E mini. Day trade, so with paper trading I'm trading mainly breakouts of support/resistance. I get around a 40% win ratio. 35-40% I'd say, but my risk reward is 1:3 so if I risk 1% I'd win 3% if I won. So it's profitable overall.

My question is, is this normal, do day traders typically lose more often then they win, but use proper money management to be successful?

Also do day traders trade literally everyday, or do they have days where nothing looks good so they don't trade? I notice I'll have roughly 2 days a week were nothing looks good, no solid trends to follow, so I won't trade.

t3_jmrrda,Trade Review 11/2: $TWTR short out of the open +$187.46,"Trade thesis: Pre-market weakness following huge gap down + dump. Friday's low of day almost the same as pre-market lows, and price hovering near that level around open. Watched for weakness and break through those levels for signal to go short for quick scalp.

Trade execution: Had a limit sell order at $40.81, got a partial fill. Got a quick $.20 move and covered some, as I often do in the first 5m of whipsaw open action. Thought about adding at VWAP retest but held off - was feeling a bit charged after getting partial fill and opted not to be too aggressive. Covered full with beautiful bounce off VWAP and break through LOD. Didn't quite reach daily goal, but I'm happy with nearly $200 in less than 5m of trading.

t3_jnkqiv,Trade Review 11/3: $DKNG long +$464.35,"Trade thesis: Saw broad pre-market strength and looked to my list of stocks that I'm stalking for long setups. $DKNG stood out with a clear confirmation on a multi-week descending wedge and room to move before resistance.

Trade execution: Stayed patient through first 10m of chop at open. Waited to see a clear hold above VWAP and a break through HOD to take a starter. Got filled w/ a market order in the $37.40's. Added in  $36.70's w/ break above yesterday HOD, position avg now $37.59. Sold half with break through $37, have a nice profit cushion now, and feeling confident w/ $SPY ripping up alongside. Sold another 1/4 position in $37.30's anticipating resistance around 0.5 fib level. Set $0.40 (1%) trailing stop and let the rest ride. $DKNG faded a bit and stopped out pretty quick.

Lessons/Takeaways: All in all happy with my performance on this trade, and got a great chunk of the move. It was a bit risky sizing into a position below yesterday's HOD, just as easily could've stopped out there, but I saw $SPY breaking through VWAP and felt the wind at my back. I also could've waited to see if 0.5 fib actually held as resistance before selling, as oppose to anticipating. Could've squeezed out a few more pennies per share, as it briefly broke above before fading.

Any questions, ask away. Thanks!

t3_jnjroo,Using Relative Strength Against SPY to Day Trade,"There are so many indicators out there it has to be difficult for any new day trader to figure out which ones to use.  

I've seen some traders that have over 10-15 indicators on their charts, making them look like a jumbled mess. 

There are your basic indicators, some of the more complex/specialized ones that require some education to understand, and custom indicators that people have built themselves.

I can only tell you what has worked for me and others I know - Relative Strength / Relative Weakness Against SPY over 30 5-Min Periods.  Btw, if you trade stocks under $5 a share, you can skip this, it won't apply.  Now of course, posting this absolutely guarantees there will be a barrage of comments bashing this idea, saying it will never work, and whatever else the bottomless well of trolls Reddit Subs seem to bring out want to say to bash something. 

To be clear - this isn't RSI.  That is a separate indicator that in my opinion has very little use.

Relative Strength / Weakness against SPY is very straightforward.  Most stocks will follow the market, we all know this.  Some won't, but in general if SPY is down you pretty much know that AAPL won't be up (as an example).  As day trader though what you need to watch out for is a change in market direction impacting the trade.  If you are Long a stock (let's say WMT) and suddenly SPY drops, most likely your stock will drop with it.

Every day however, there are some stocks that are stronger than SPY and others that are weaker. When SPY is dropping there are some stocks that are holding up better than others.  And when SPY is going up, there are some stocks that remain weak.  

Looking at those stocks over 30 5-min periods that have Relative Strength/Weakness (taking volume into account), gives you a list of stocks that you know are better bets in several ways.  First, it offers protection.  If you go long on a stock that has Relative Strength and the market begins to pull back, you know your stock will not be as impacted by the drop (and visa-versa).  Secondly, these are stocks that benefit the most from those SPY moves.  If you are short a stock that is Relatively Weak and SPY begins to drop, your stock is likely to drop in higher proportion than others.

I believe that focusing your day trading on Stocks that fall under this criteria is one the single best things you can do to improve your day trading (and you would have to decide what qualifies - which is done through indexing the stocks.  For example, a stock that is indexed at 1.4 is going to be 40% stronger than other stocks point for point with SPY).

Now all the trolls can come out and say why this doesn't work when it clearly does.  But either way, take it or leave it.",31,0.98,1604440451,"[['AAPL', 1]]",AAPL,112.3499984741211,119.62999725341797

Please vote if youâre pro this idea and/or comment if you wish. 

Then these flaired users will be ranked and those who are prop-trading like me will be able to choose or even ask them directly for free or for a price. I mean donât we pay lawyers or engineers when inquiring them? Weekly AMAs would be great. Itâd help ranking.

Iâve spent some time on subredditstats.com comparing the most popular trading-relates subs and we really need to do something with this one which I personally like very much.

Also, it has Forex in description while there are not so many active discussions on that topic. Even futures arenât discussed actively. Itâs mostly stocks. Why not just focus on stocks then. Equities, derivatives and futures. There are subs for crypto, Forex and commodities.

# Trade 1: $LYFT short

Trade thesis: Huge gap up today within the context of a multi-month downtrend. Noticed 200D SMA nearby, along with several weekly highs. Lots of levels to make entries or adds. 5m RSI oversold coming into the open.

Trade execution: Took a full size position with break below 5m, 1m and low of day after failure to hold above 200D SMA. Covered half into 1m bull flag confirmation, 1/4th into 100D SMA support, and got stopped out on the rest w/ a $0.30 trailing stop.

Lessons/Takeaways: My entry was quite aggressive, but I was pretty confident in the move given the big rejection. That said, it probably would've been more prudent to take a starter size w/ loss of 5m up trend, then wait for break below VWAP to add. Overall happy w/ execution.

t3_jqgn0w,Bias in Level 2 order book imbalances?,"Barring trends, Iâm trying to understand what the Level 2 limit orders on the DOM are telling me about anticipated direction. For simplicity, Iâm ignoring spoofing and other techniques.

Letâs use an example of the DOM showing 1100 bids (traders looking to go long or exit short at a favorable price) and 1500 asks (traders looking to go short or exit long at a favorable price) across the visible levels. 

Scenario A - Some folks say that more limit orders = more support / resistance to slow the movement in that direction, therefore the price is biased to go towards the direction of FEWER orders. In the example, direction is biased to go DOWN because itâs easier to clear out the 1100 bids via market sells than it is to clear the 1500 asks via market buys.

Scenario B - Other folks say that the side with the more limit orders is representative of direction, so the price is biased to go in the direction of MORE orders. In the example, the price is set to go up through the 1500 asks, rather than down the 1100 bids.

I struggle with which is correct, because itâs not clear to me whether the limit orders represent entries or exits, and which they are can entirely change whether Iâm looking at smart money or dumb money forming the book. If A is the case, I want to be at the front of the side with the heaviest orders, so that I can ride the wave as the market clears out the weaker side. If B is the case, I want to market into the weaker side and ride a slow trudge through the heavy side. I feel like if A is reality, then the weak side is smart exits, the heavy side is smart entries risking not getting filled. If B is reality, then the weak side is smart entries, and the heavy side is smart exits.

t3_jsjh5q,Day Trading Options VS Shares? Mainly Scalping," 

Anyone here day trade options? I have read and searched 15 or so threads.. every comment is about the same. Day Trade Futures or shares. I have been learning to trade with live options in a new trader app at first now in a better one (guess I can't mention... lol) for about 2 years. Mainly Apple and SPY since I can read them well/volume.

My question is: For someone who only trades with smaller lot sizes ($5k-$15k) . Why is it generally recommended to not day trade options? Under this plan: Never hold overnight, scalping only, waiting for confirmation, stop losses and trail stops. Wouldn't you net more than shares? If your cutting losses correctly wouldn't the risk be minimal. Like it seems to me as if the percentages for growth would be greater if you scalp in the correct direction. What am I missing? Only thing I can think of is if IV moves quickly during the trade.

I have finally become profitable month over month (only like 3%, still struggle with cutting losses but a lot better now - legit just started to use stop losses 2 months ago - Using TOS has helped.

* Most notable was TD Ameritrade On-Demand feature, and then some smaller apps, but I wanted something that's super easy/quick to start with and use.

**I wanted something that combines all the things that I'm looking for:**

* **Quick start in seconds - no download, install, registration, etc.** 
* **Easy to use UI/UX.**
* **Minimal bias - accomplished by picking random asset/time and hiding them.**
* **Make trades and fast forward time for a super quick feedback/learning loop.**

# Trade 1: $QDEL short +$1711.43

Trade thesis: Bear flag on the daily chart, yesterday closed towards lows, looking for any weakness out of the gate to go short w/ target below yesterday LOD.

Trade execution: Out of the gate we get a nice clean dump below VWAP. I jump in full size. I start profit taking on the move down, holding half size into break below yesterday's LOD. Scale out as we confirm break through YLOD, and get stopped out on final 1/8th of position w/ trailing stop.

Lessons/Takeaways: I'm pleased with me execution, but I'd be very hesitant to trade this name again. Within minutes of open, spread became abysmal and volume started drying up. Too risky for the kind of size I trade with.

# Trade 2: $PTON short +$266.38

Trade thesis: Looking like a potential daily bear flag and forming a tightening range below VWAP while struggling to break 50D SMA. 

Trade execution: Went short with small size on first 1m candle to break low. I wanted to see a break down below LOD and we didn't get it, so I covered on the way back up. 

Lessons/Takeaways: I don't regret exiting this trade even though it ended up dumping later. The break back over 50D SMA and VWAP would've been way too bullish for me to be holding short, and this would've been a losing trade had I not exited. By the time it came back down, I had moved on to other names.

# Trade 3: $MRNA long +$549.81

Trade thesis: In a daily up trend heading towards all time highs. 7$ pocket between 11/12 HOD and all time highs. Looking for a break through 11/12 HOD and a squeeze into area of no resistance. 

Trade execution: Took full size on break through yesterday HOD. Exited half on rejection of $88.50 to lock in profits. Exited another 1/4 below $89. Threw a $0.80 trailing stop on and got stopped out quickly.

Lessons/Takeaways: Solid execution overall. A little trigger happy on the sell below $88.50, but that topping tail made me jumpy.

# Trade 4: $BABA short +$474.81

Trade thesis:  In a sharp daily downtrend. Multiple rejections off \~$272 100D SMA resistance with a close near the lows today. Looking for break of 11/12 LOD and 4H bear flag confirmation. On intraday, grinding between yesterday LOD, today LOD, and VWAP. Looking for clean break below today LOD.

Trade execution: Took half size on break below LOD. Covered above low of dip. Covered 1/4 on mini 1m bear flag confirmation, stopped out on remaining position. 

Lessons/Takeaways: Happy with execution over all. Could've added on break below low of dip. Could've also had wider trailing stop. Used a $1 trail instead of my normal 1%, which would be $2.60ish.

# Trade 5: $NIO short +$839.26

Trade thesis: Had this on the watchlist as a potential momentum long. Noticed a blow off top (tailing top candle on top of a parabolic move) on the daily chart. Saw 2 potential short entry points and a head and shoulders look. 

Trade execution: Took half size starter position on first 1m candle to make new low on VWAP rejection. Added to full size on confirmation of imperfect head and shoulders. Covered 1/2 into initial dump. Break even level has plenty of cushion now. Covered another 1/4th into next leg down. Made a good lot of my profits on the last leg down with a $0.50 trailing stop.  

Lessons/Takeaways: Probably my cleanest execution out of all 5 trades today. If you follow me, you'll notice many times the trailing stop on the last 1/4 or 1/8 position doesn't always add to my profit, but it never cuts deep into my losses. It's trades like these that make that strategy pay off. \~Half the gain came from that final quarter position.

* We test **358.75** but close the day underneath -- Neutral to bearish.
* We test **358.75** and close above -- Bullish.
* We don't test **358.75** \-- Bearish.

Here's what I'll be watching for in order to take a trade today:

* If we run right up to **357.50**, look for a failed breakout. 
* If we grind up to **357.50**, look for a breakout to **358.75**.
* If we run right up to **358.75** look to fade (\~2-3 minute hold)

Even though we have little resistance past **358.75**, I won't play a breakout there today as we'd already be close to our 1-day ATR (average true range).

Massive multiday rip with a spinning top candle 11/12. Could signal a reversal, and see a nice dump below LOD. Could also catch shorts sleeping and squeeze above HOD.

t3_juolg7,Paper Trading vs Live Trading,"TLDR: Iâm looking for advice on transitioning to live trading. 

Iâve been paper trading for 2 months, every morning for 2 hours. Iâve done everything I could to mimic my paper trading account to what my live trading with be. I funded my paper account with 30k, only trading 1% to 1.5% of my capital. I felt as though my paper trading was real money. I grew my paper account by 6k by the end of my two months day trading long options.

I typically wait for the market to reverse itâs direction, with a 1M chart I wait for confirmation that itâs heading in the anticipated direction, RSI is in alignment, and MacD is starting to show strength in the direction that Iâm looking to trading in. 

I switched to live trading two weeks ago, doing everything that I would do while paper trading, and I keep having red days. Iâm down 1k overall, only one positive day of 150. 

I went back to paper trading on Friday to see if Iâm going crazy or my strategy isnât working. I profited $600 following my same principles. 

I feel like paper trading with TOS is like trading with a giant freight ship and switching to live trading is like jumping on a cigarette boat.

Any advice on how to transition to live trading? Iâve been reading several books and working my way through a few trading courses. Although, nobody seems to talk about the difference in speed between the two.",2,0.67,1605457871,"[['RSI', 1]]",RSI,11.168999671936035,14.1899995803833

t3_jv8cnw,NOOB broke the rules & paid for it!,"I KNOW BETTER!.... I saw on the news this morning that Moderna had a vaccine so I wanted to jump in pre-market (first rules broken- emotion & pre-market) and make a quick profit.

The stock was around $96 at the time. I wasn't sure how to place a trade or set a stop loss in TOS (another broken rule) so by the time I placed my trade, without a stop it was at $105.43. Emotion, emotion, emotion, panic, and a liberal dose of stupidity. It peaked at $105.85 shortly after and started dropping while I tried to figure out how to place a stop.  I tried a couple times but watched as the price passed my stop and  my sell order didn't execute.  Next rule broken- I bought 10 shares, which was way more than 5% of my small account.  Finally, I decided to hold until the market opened, positive that the price would jump.  Add another healthy shot of stupidity.  I ended up just placing a market sell order on the TD Ameritrade website and lost $5/share.   

Moral of the story- there's a reason why the ""pro's"" reiterate risk and money management, keeping emotion out of the trade, and recommend learning the trading platform before trading.

There's this forex/options trader I've been following on facebook, he's local to where i am, he regularly posts screenshots of his trades. He just started offering two services to people following him...

One is a mentorship program for $350 (one time fee), it includes full access to him for 1 year. He covers everything from beginning to end, trading based on chart analysis instead of signals, weekly chart breakdowns, etc.

The other is account management where he places trades on my behalf. The difference here is i would be learning on my own without his help and this is more for people who want to build more leverage in their account. This service costs $150 per month plus partial commissions.

# Numbers:

**362.00** \- Yesterday's resistance

**359.59** \- Yesterday's low (poor)

**358.75** \- **358.90** \- Friday's high / gap

**358.20** \- Friday's VPOC (most volume traded)

**357.50** \- Friday's breakout out (now support)

&#x200B;

# Gameplan:

Yesterday morning the SPY continued to run into resistance at the breakout area of **362**. It pulled back, putting in a poor low, and then broke above **362** on high volume to close the day. We're now set to open near the lows of yesterday.

&#x200B;

[Yesterday's market profile from marketprofile.io](https://preview.redd.it/70gwogu90tz51.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=a72590267550eb5cf8b3adae2427a8e2a03aa241)

I know you're probably getting sick of hearing this but it happened again. Another poor low, another large move down in the overnight session. Poor lows normally result in a repair operation the following day. What's a repair operation look like? Poor lows are repaired when the price goes $0.10-0.20 *below* the poor low and fills out the profile of the previous day. Poor lows represent a level where buyers stepped in hard but sellers were still present. A move lower/higher only *truly* ends when there is a lack of buyers/sellers.

Likewise, on the top of the profile, it looks like volume was just chopped off. This has much to do with price being in that area at the end of day, but it also has a lot to do with the *amount* of volume that was traded during the end-of-day breakout. The last time we saw that kind of volume in a 5 minute bar was at the end of the pivot low on 10/30.

This morning, many of the sectors are trading near the bottom of yesterday's range while the Q's are holding *above* the base of the end-of-day rally. The bottom of that base is around 292.50 and could mark a larger move in the SPY should we get below.

If we see an exhaustion move into any of the numbers above (aka we come in hot and heavy), I'll look to get long for a bounce. **357.50** & **365.50** also look like very appealing areas that are right around the SPY's 1-day ATR (average true range).

t3_jxkb5p,Swing and daytrading mostly naked options,"Always liked the stock market.  Got my feet wet with stocks straight out of college, and blew up my account twice because i didn't know what i was doing.  Fast forward to this year, decided to try again.  This time, I had a bigger account was far more knowledgeable on stock market and individual company fundamentals.  I took part of my investment out and dove into my own trading method with a mixture of swing trading naked short call/puts, short straddles, and occasional day trades here and there based entirely on gut feeling from price action.

As to why I prefer shorting options and recommend doing so goes back to an ex hedge fund guy i met a while back.  The way he put it - 'if the stock market was a casino, and option buyers were the gamblers, then what does that make option seller?  The house.  The expected value of the house is positive.  The house always wins.""

Here's my top 10 winners and losers since March.  As you can see most of my gains are from TSLA, which I have been selling puts and short straddles for 6 months.

My worst loss was from short straddling ZM on 8 separate strikes when the stock was trading at 580 (Premium was  $100, which i thought was safe).  I scaled out of my positions for a loss when I realized things weren't going my way, and closed out entirely without any second thought when the stock broke 480.

CHK was also an interesting loss, because I sold naked calls during the crazy short squeeze from $16 - 70.  The unrealized losses were actually far more severe, but I knew fundamentals would play out eventually, which cut my losses greatly.

PLTR is the only one on the list where the gains came from long options (2022 leaps)  I bought 30 jan 20/22 strike leaps with a cost basis of 1.6-1.7, before the big move.  Sold 1/3 before earnings and another 1/3 last night.  Letting the rest ride through 2021.

t3_jz3v44,Looking to transition from regular work to day trading; is this a good transition plan?,"I've been wanting to get into day trading for the past 2-3 years, but my regular job has prevented me from doing so due to being during regular market hours, and also being physically, mentally and emotionally draining, leaving me with little energy or motivation at the end of the day.  I feel like I have a fair amount of trading knowledge, but not much in the way of experience with actual trading or taking stock of my emotional discipline.  I've decided that if I want to seriously get into day trading, I need to transition from my regular job.  I'll go half-time at work for a while, trading mornings and working afternoons.  I've written down a transition plan that I would like to get this sub's feedback on.  Is there anything obvious I'm forgetting or have gotten wrong?  Any changes/additions?

I know also that 6 months may seem a bit ambitious of a timeline, but that can be extended if need be, and I don't think my target goals (an eighth or quarter of a percent daily avg. return) are too unrealistic after that amount of time.  I would be starting with $50k in capital (so no PDT worries) and looking to replace half or eventually all (and then some) of a $32k/year wage.  And no, I'm not touching anything in my retirement account!

# Transition to day trading plan

My regular job: go half-time (afternoons).

Week 1: 100% education (mostly refresher).

Months 1-3: continuing education; explore & test (back-test & real-time) various trading strategies; do paper trading. Stocks & ETFâs only, no options or forex.

After 3 months: self-evaluation. Decide whether to keep paper trading, or transition into real trades. Also consider different time frames, e.g. scalping or swing trading.

Real-trade transition: start small, $100-ish trades. As profit consistency is achieved, gradually scale up to larger-sized trades: $500-ish, $1,000-ish, $5k-ish, then on up to $10k-ish.

After 6 months: self-evaluation. If still at the paper-trade stage, consider whether to keep going or go back to working regular job FT. If at the small-trade stage, consider sizing up if warranted by consistency of profits. If at the full-sized trade stage, consider quitting regular job and doing day trading FT (again if warranted by consistency of profits).

Every 3 months after initial 6 months: continued self-evaluations. May also consider moving into options and/or forex, again depending on consistency of profits.

Loss mitigation/prevention:

1. Continuing education, including trade journaling.
2. Always use stop losses.
3. Always have a plan/strategy for trade entry & exit (SL/TP) points. Stick to plan as best as possible. If this proves difficult, focus harder on overcoming emotional aspects of trading.
4. Never risk >1% of total capital on any trade.
5. Stop trading for the day if losses exceed X%, or for the week if losses exceed Y%.  (What are good values for X & Y?)

Goals: eventually earn enough day trading to stay at regular job half-time, or preferably, quit it altogether. Assuming $50k capital to work with and FT regular-job pay of $32k/year:

* To replace 50% of regular-job pay, assuming regular drawdowns equaling $16k/year I would need to earn: $64/day average, or 0.128% daily avg. return.
* To replace 100% of regular-job pay, assuming regular drawdowns equaling $32k/year I would need to earn: $128/day average, or 0.256% daily avg. return.",6,0.76,1606080264,"[['FT', 2], ['X', 1]]",FT,7.119999885559082,7.329999923706055
t3_jyxyv3,A Method I Use To Guarantee Iâm improving My Trading,"In a word, self review.

This is for those who really want to improve quickly and it may seem like a fair amount of work, but itâs actually not.

Assuming you keep a trading journal, reviewing the trades of the week every weekend gives you a huge edge as you are no longer âassumingâ youâre making progress. No thoughts like 

âIâm pretty sure this part of my strategy is to blame for my results this weekâ

When you review, and review properly, you KNOW.

Hereâs some of the main things I like to be aware of

1. What % of trades fit my plan
2. Out of my losses, what % fit my plan
3. Out of my wins, what % fit my plan

Once I have this information, Iâve established how my plan has actually performed and separated that from the original result. This allows me to see the REAL results of my plan.

Then I can get more granular and look at why I took specific trades and if the losses were just probabilities playing out or if there is a fundamental floor in my plan.

95% of traders wonât do this, and yet it could be the difference you need to make headway.

When I started doing this, it made it crystal clear what my REAL issues were. It allowed me to see my patterns as a trader and what barriers I came up against. 

I tried to attach an image to this but seems I can either do text or image so I may repost just the image, let me know.

&#x200B;

I've noticed (and love the fact) that so may people in daytrading specifically are caught on psychology and psychological hang ups. Even yesterday there was a write up on ""the best strategy won't make your rich"" and couldn't agree more. 

I did a recent write up on this very topic on something that loads of people miss when pursuing a real career in trading - simplification. 

&#x200B;

I coached a couple guys and the issues were all the same, just as mine were (and still are sometimes):

\- Overtrading

\- No actual trading plan written down, with buy rules, sell rules and position size

\- No respect for risk 

\- Amazing ability to risk to much 

People go super deep on these topics and rightly so but there are some pretty straight forward things that have helped me be consistent in my trading career:

 

1. Limiting social media - this was a life changer not just in trading
2. Reducing Screening Criteria results (so more criteria but less selection)
3. Optimizing my Trading Workspace - the layouts and qualifying trades
4. Using a Checklist
5. Quarterly Trade Review

I think the first part of getting more consistent is really treating this like a business. The amount of people deluded about what it takes ""is too damn high"" though. 

Everybody wants to make the money, nobody wants to accept it just takes HUGE personal responsibility and some years to get spot on.

&nbsp;

**BABA (-$51.25)**

Ticker has been really bullish the past few days and was on my watchlist in hopes of getting a swing entry on a 4h higher low. It had a 1m EQ form at the start of the day and I went long. I played a smaller than normal position because I wasn't super confident in this one due to expecting 4h consolidation. The decision to go long was largely based upon SPY/QQQ doing bullish things at the open.

**PLTR (+$92.58)**

Ticker has been running super hard the past few weeks. Opened bullish and within striking distance of the ATH. After an nice initial push up I bought what looked like a 2m higher low. In hindsight I took profit on this one way too fast.

[PLTR 2m Higher Low](https://imgur.com/a/uJKqs8i)

**SQ (+$345.38)**

Ticker opened near the previous ATH from 11/6 of $201.33 ($204.09 PM 11/9). I went long with a starter position looking for continuation and added on a 2m higher low. I went long again after QQQ hit a new LOD and SQ did not. I got stopped out but re-entered when QQQ broke to a new LOD and immediately reversed.

Ticker high a new ATH off the open and then formed an EQ. It was holding up much better than QQQ. I went long looking for the EQ to break bullish off of a QQQ 5m oversold bounce taking place.

Gapped up to ATH today. After it opened strong I was looking for the 5m/15m to play out as a Bull Flag. I took 2 trades with that in mind. I was watching the 2m chart and based the entries off of green reversal candles, where the 5m EMAs were, and what QQQ was doing on the 2m/5m.

All trades are entered off of the 2m & 5m time frame (I watch both). The 1m charts in some screenshots are for entry clarity. Stops are at the most recent low on the 2m and then are moved up to subsequent higher lows on the 2m or 5m. Occasionally the bottoms of candles are used if the R:R isn't good enough to use the low. Feel free to leave questions for critiques.

**TSLA (+$444.5)**

Ticker was at ATHs pre-market and anytime a hype ticker is coming off of ATHs I look to play a bounce when it first hits 5m oversold. 

The 2nd trade was just looking for a higher low on the 15m. I played a smaller position size because while visually TSLA was in the right spot QQQ was at the HOD. I would have been more comfortable if QQQ was also going for a 15m HL.

You can also see in the pic that I closed out 1 share of a 5 share swing position from $435.95 at $540.75 pre-market.  This swing was entered the day after the big gap up off of news TSLA was getting added to the S&P. I closed 2 shares yesterday pre-market so I'm still holding 2. I posed the inital flipping I did to get a good cost basis.

**NIO (+$512.54)**

Same setup as TSLA. Ticker was at ATHs pre-market. There was a nice double bottom on the 2m with 5m & 15m RSI oversold.

Scaled out and then went short after a break over $55 with no follow through. I covered pretty quick to be protective as I was still bullish on the ticker and then went long for a 5m higher low attempt. I took profit on 1/2 of that position when it moved up and was stopped out of the 2nd half shortly after for a roughly breakeven trade for that last one.

[NIO 5m o/s bounce, short scalp, & 5m HL attempt](https://imgur.com/a/Z2GbCyK)

**CGC (-284.16)**

Ticker broke resistance on the weekly shortly after the open on increasing bull volume so I was super interested in getting in on any sort of pullback. I was stopped out 3 times on this one, the last time right at the bottom. As a personal rule I will usually only make 2 attempts at a trade like this but I made a 3rd as the guy who runs the trading group I'm in mentioned he was entering. He has a stupid high winrate so I typically make note of or copy his positions if it's a ticker I'm already playing. 

1st attempt was for a bull flag possibility and front running 27 psychological support. I was stopped out for -$50 or so. 

2nd entry attempt was off a green 2m candle near the .5 fib level and I was stopped out again for around -$50

3rd entry attempt was off a green 2m candle near the 0.618 fib level. I had my stop at 26.29... so of course it bounced at 26.27 for -$180ish. In hindsight I question entering at this low of a fib level even if a 5m lower high is still the most likely scenario. Not bouncing before the 0.5 fib doesn't matchup with the super bullish signs the ticker was showing off of the open.

**QQQ (+$446.51)**

Went long with a little starter position after NQ started threatening to break bull out of the 4h EQ. I entered the rest of the shares I had planned on scaling into if it had pulled back from where I first entered of off a 5m HL. I took profit when the 1h chart started to get over extended and it looked like it was due for consolidation. On this sort of breakout I'd normally look to swing some of the position but I've already got an open MNQ swing from around 11200.

Lets say that we have a stock XYZ that pays a dividend on a monthly basis. At certain points during the month we might not know when the next dividend payment will âofficiallyâ be paid out. Most monthly dividend stocks pay their dividend in a pattern each month like on the 2nd Friday of the month or the 10th trading day of the month, etc. The company usually doesnât publish this information but if you inspect the historical data then you can see the trend or pattern that they use for their ex-dividend date and record-date. We might be able to estimate when the ex-dividend date and record-date will be but until the company officially announces these dates then it will only be an estimate. The day when the company actually announces these dates is referred to as the dividend declaration date.

After the dividend declaration date occurs we have all the dates that we need for the swing-trade, namely: the ex-dividend date, dividend record-date, and the dividend payable date. If we are not able to estimate these dates before the dividend declaration date then it will not be possible for us to do the analysis needed to setup our dividend swing-trade or dividend reinvestment position. For this reason, I typically only enter positions when the ex-dividend date has been confirmed by the company. 

Now that we have all the dates that we need we can start looking at what each one of these dates means.  If I want to collect the dividend on each share of XYZ that I purchase, then I must make sure that I buy XYZ shares before the ex-dividend date. If I buy a stock one business day before its record date, my trade will only settle the day after the record date. I would therefore not be a shareholder of record for receiving the dividend.

So, in order to make sure that I qualify for the dividend I want to buy the stock at least two business days before the date of record, or one day before the ex-dividend date. 

[Where to buy](https://imgur.com/a/ohm0AgT)

Using the graphic above as an example I would need to buy the stock on Monday the 5th to be eligible to receive the dividend payment. Monday the 5th is two trading-days before the date of record and one trading-day before the ex-dividend date. Now it should become more obvious why I use one trading-day before the ex-dividend date as the sell date for my swing-trades. This is a major part of my strategy as I use the run up into the dividend ex-date to make swings.  

The goal for my swing-trades is not to capture the dividend but rather sell my shares at a premium price to the buyers that are willing to pay a premium during the days leading up to the day before the ex-dividend date so that they will be on the record books and will therefore collect the dividend payment for the stock. You can receive gains many times the amount of the dividend by buying early and then selling the rights to these dividend shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date.

People who are in search of high dividend yield using the dividend capture strategy are willing to pay a premium for their shares in the days just before the ex-dividend date because they donât want to miss out on the dividend payment. The fear of missing out is a very motivating force in the minds of men and women alike and it can be seen in the data that I have collected over the last few years.  

So just to recap the overall strategy is to find a dividend stock that typically has a run up into the ex-dividend date.  To do this I look at historical data 2-14 days prior to determine when the run up into earnings typically starts. 


A couple of suggestions:
1.)	Donât swing trade stocks that are at or very close to their 52-week high 
2.)	Look for stocks that have been in a down trend since their last ex-div date 

Example: 

To start I narrow my search to stocks that have an ex-date 2-3 weeks out.  This usually brings my window of stocks to research down to about 30-40 stocks.  For this example, I will be looking at stocks with a confirmed Ex-Date between 12/01/2020 and 12/10/2020 this narrows my window down to 18 tickers. 

The stock Tegna (TGNA) looks to have a pretty good setup to me.  TGNA has a quarterly dividend.  At the moment it is about 20% off of its 52-week high..  For this example, I am going to look at the previous 24 dividend Time Periods to determine statistically when Is the best time to buy. 

The below chart shows historically what day has been the best day to buy if I plan on selling the shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date. The chart shows from 2 days out all the way to 14 days out as I have found this Is the sweet spot for the run up into ex-dividend. 

[Historical % returns by day](https://imgur.com/a/Ovuuyh9)

It is clear that for TGNA buying 13 â 14 days out is the way to go (remember this is looking at the pasts 24 dividend periods or 6 years).  Though all of the days running up into ex-dividend are positive.  This is a great sign as history is on our side that this is a good stock to dividend swing trade with. Meaning that historically if I consistently bought all days 2 through 14, I would have been profitable.  To take it one step further I look at what would have happened if I bought 14 days out for each of the previous 24 dividend swing plays. 

In the below chart you can see the exact percent gains for each of the last 24 dividend swing trades if I went with the 14 day out strategy.  When taking a closer look, we can see that there have been swings has high as +30% and as low as -10% which is huge.  I prefer to take a safer approach as I am really only going for a small 3-5% gain each month as I have found that works a lot better in the long run.  

[14 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/OhWXVxY)


To go with a more conservative approach I look at the previous 24 dividend periods for 6 days out.  What I find is that only 2 / 24 previous swing trades on day 6 would have resulted in a loss and only one of those periods would have been significant.  This is more of my style and likely the play that I will go with. 

[6 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/zZG1zZh)

Since the confirmed ex-date for TGNA is 12/10 I will be looking to buy on 12/2 and sell on 12/9.  For this specific example looking at the data I can see that days 2-14 have all be profitable I will likely buy in slowly over the entire period with the majority of shares bought on 12/6.  

I have used this strategy for quite some time and have basically perfected it to the point where on average I am getting returns in the 2-5% region per month.  There are other ways to improve this strategy as well, but I wanted to see if people here were interested in this type of swing trade.   


Important Terminology: 

 Ex-dividend Date: Is the day in which the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value.  Investors who purchased the stock before the ex-dividend data are entitled to the next dividend payment while those who purchased the stock in the ex-dividend date, or after, are not. 
confirmed ex-dividend date â This is the ex-dividend date that has been officially announced by the company on the dividend declaration date. 

dividend capture strategy â A dividend capture strategy is a timing-oriented investment strategy revolving around the purchase and sale of dividend-paying stocks. Dividend capture is specifically the practice of buying a stock just prior to the ex-dividend date in order to capture the dividend, then selling it immediately after the dividend is paid. 


dividend record-date â The record date, or date of record, is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution.",15,0.86,1606339904,"[['TGNA', 3]]",TGNA,14.420000076293945,14.789999961853027

Started paper trading during the summer, experimenting different stuff, mainly sticking to Stock CFD (no crypto, almost no forex, no long term investing)

Decided to go real starting Nov 1st

Chose TRADING 212 both paper trading and actual real trading   
All went well until last week/this week   


That broker went basically tits up (proof about that on their subreddit and twitter)   
\-Spreads on basically anything ""hot"" are skyrocketing, making even small moves a nightmare (there are screenshots running around and we are at cringe-meme status right now)  
\-They made impossible to go long on any big mover (aka EV and other ""hot"" ones)   
\-they keep being vague about it online and on social platforms, it is actually the 3rd time I see this kind of behaiour happening in the last 3/4 weeks, we reached a limit.  


I'd like to find a middle ground between ""commission free"" brokers and actual ""PRO"" ones.  
I had a blast using trading 212's (when it worked). Not being forced to pay 7/10/15â¬ per action on this kind of ""SMALL"" trades is a huge boon (I had trades where making 10â¬ as profit was completely acceptable and my actual target) and the variety of stock choice even if not perfect its really good for my needs.

\-has the same (or better obv) amount of choice as trading 212 on stock CFDs  
\-might allow scalping (this is a plus, free brokers do not condone sub 5min action)   
\-allows a non proprietary interface (I actually like the Trading 212 UI and App but I know its limited and I'd like to start learning something like MT4/5 or similar solutions)  


Can anyone point me to a differend broker ?? I keep searching online and all I see its either extremely similar to Trading 212 or ""pro"" solutions where commission fees are just impossible to deal with with an account my size.

t3_k0wsjp,APXT: Merger with AvePoint,"APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePointâs 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoftâs 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022. 

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. 

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. 

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, 

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

t3_k2tazb,Hereâs why 90% of day traders lose money,"First off, I donât know where that 90% statistic comes from - everyone just repeats it like it is gospel, but Iâve never seen any real verification.

Still, letâs assume itâs true.  Why would 9 out of 10 new day-traders fail?

Iâm sure there are lots of reasons, but I can share what Iâve seen. 

Looking at the questions I get asked from people starting out itâs clear they have spent no time doing their own research.  Right now there is more information out there on technical analysis, trade setups, options, etc than ever before.  Itâs insane that people jump into a field, use their money and have no idea what the basics are or how to use them.

Platforms even let you paper-trade, but no, nobody wants to do that.   The other day someone who was trading asked, âWhat does it mean when someone says Long AAPL 117.02?â  Iâm serious, they were literally buying and selling stocks, and asked that question.

This phenomenon happened awhile back in poker.  People watched it on TV, played some games with friends, and then thought they could go to a poker room with their student loan money.  They got wiped out.  

So the number 1 reason new traders lose? They donât take the time to actually learn.

The next reason? As these uneducated new traders continue on, reloading their accounts for the 5th time, they eventually find a community or two.  Perhaps an active chat room during trading hours.  They see trade suggestions, or in chat rooms - real time trades, and follow them. They donât seem to realize that they need an exit plan, technical analysis, where is the stop? When do you take profit?  Another example - last week someone followed a trade into KNDI at around $13.  KNDI dropped 30 cents and the new trader bailed, but the trader that posted it stayed. Around two hours later the original poster took 50 cents profit.  The new trader bought 3,000 shares and lost $900.

Day trading âlooksâ easy, like anyone can do it.  You buy low, sell high.  Done.  So everyone tries and most donât put in the work to get it right.

I see successful day traders all the time. And I can tell you, they all know it front and back. And it takes a LONG time to get there. Itâs a commitment.

So yes, maybe itâs true that 90% of new day-traders fail.  Itâs probably also true that 90% of new day-traders donât bother to actually learn how to day-trade.",67,0.9500000000000001,1606589775,"[['KNDI', 2], ['AAPL', 1]]",KNDI,9.729999542236328,9.949999809265137

Been day trading for 8 months and this last 3 trading days are when I have finally went red to green and made up all of my losses. Only 4\/19 trading days so far have been red.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** Friday was hot. We made some quick but powerful plays and were done early. This morning the SPY is gapping down slightly but there are plenty of stocks gapping up. Price action has been and remains bullish at this moment. The SPY is now sitting at the top of the daily range near highs with the 9ema (short term ma) right below. Nearest support under the 9 ema is the 354 pivot and the 20 dma. Looks like there's some interest in these SPACs because that's mostly what is gaping pre market. My focus will remain on recent momentum and stocks with catalyst. I may put 1 or 2 spacs on the list but they won't be my main focus. Good luck trading.

**TECHNICAL PLAYS: $UONE** daily candle closed as a bearish candle but i think its a bullish move on whatâs happening. i see a pull back in effect but its to further confirm an uptrend. AH corrected back to previous close price. We may see a slight gap down Monday PM for a buy opportunity sub 5.10 with some consolidation throughout the day curling up into power hour for a continuation of uptrend Tuesday. technical are showing bullish. Lets go! 

**$CEI** technicals are showing a short term downtrend. consolidation on support around .94 and a bounce off bottom bollinger on 1hr. Signs of a reversal of short term downtrend to continue up trending and retest resistance levels at 1.02. this rally could spur a short squeeze to 1.20s as MACD begins to curl up and cross back bullish above the signal and 0 line. holding and accumulating. bottom pivot is .90. 

**$WEI** pivot point to break is prior highs at 2.70. the pullback can very much continue and a drop under 1.73 will be an indication of further downtrend to test support levels in the low 1.50s. may retest resistance levels around 2.12 for an attempt to break out. MACD bullish above signal and 0 line, weekly MACD about to cross 0 line. huge!!. tight bollinger band squeeze. bullish engulfing on the weekly chart! 

**$AAPL** YTD charts are mirroring Tesla and Nasdaq composite, looking for a major break out. Calls for after January might be something to look into. Of course, I bought CALL for 1/15/21 when the stock hit a low of $112.50. Online rumors say the reason stock has not had their major breakout is due to their iPhone 12 sales already price into the stock. For this week YTD technical are showing a bullish trend up the fibo chart and may see some resistance $118.49.

So if you like to risk $100 per trade then you want to make $300. 

Now this doesnât mean you force 3-1 plays. This means you must find them. 

I went through a phase in my trading where all I traded was 3-1+ plays. Meaning I made a minimum of 3R and sometimes 4-5-9R in one trade. This doesnât happen often and in fact trading with a 3-1 R.R requires a ton of patience. 

Hereâs how I overcame my impatience and taking profits too soon

1. Entered my trade with a plan (meaning I knew where my stop was and price target) 
2. Set a range limit order (meaning: itâs a auto stop that stops you out at your risk level and takes profits at your profit target automatically)
3. Once I set my range limit I walked away and worked out, walked, created content to help others on my YouTube etc... do something else!
4. End of day came back to either 3R gain or 1R L

Bonus: every 30 min or hour Iâd look at chart and re adjust my risk and sometimes would end up with zero risk or a 1-2 R gainer when wrong. 

How do you know if thereâs 3R in a setup? Thatâs an entire diff convo.

I use degiro for investingÂ and swing trading, which has been so far a nice experience. The rates are reasonably low. With a fixed 10â¬ or so per month the prices are also updated on real time, instead of with the default 15min delay, which should make it viable for day trading. Unfortunately it's still a very amateurish environment: No pre/post market trading, no keyboard shortcuts, no API, etc. It lacks many features found in interactivebrokers.

Other than that, I had short experiences with traderepublic and consorsbank but these also aren't oriented towards professional day traders.

I also found the Alpaca API but alas, not available for Europe.

t3_k7fasn,My Trading RULES,"1 - Have a Max Loss (if my max loss is hit for the day then I shutdown my software and go to the gym, eat, walk, something else)

2- have a max loss per trade as well. This doesnât have to be just monetary. If I am wrong on a trade 2-3 times then I stop messing with that symbol. 

3- only enter near S / R. I only want to enter near support or resistance. IF I chase, then I am only going to size in max 1/3-1/4 size

4- donât cut because your scared, cut because your WRONG. (If my plan is shit, and stock hits my risk , aka the area where my thesis is wrong then I get out)

5- take profits at key resistance or support areas. I like to size out in 1/3 or 1/4s

6- Big Picture. I need to know what the big picture is so I can understand if Iâm counter trend trading or trading with the trend. This helps me know how to size and how to risk. 

7- donât jump into a stock that appears on radar 10 mins before open... I didnât prep for that. 

8- float rotators means be extra careful. Play it more safe. Maybe down size a bit too. Pay more attention to small warning signs. 

9- donât look at PnL (I sometimes wonât look at it for the entire week, and one quarter a entire month) this helps me stay on my A GAME. now sometimes I do look at it daily at end of day if Iâm testing something out and curious. But never during day

10- Looked at PnL. If I do look at it durin trading day then I cut my size down personally because I know it does effect me and how I trade. Either I donât want to give back or donât want to go further in red. 

11- know your weaknesses and PLAN accordingly (this is how I have my rules and how I stay consistent)

12- track and review review REVIEW 

13- Itâs 100% fine not to trade

Having had all these indicators, I have traded many parabolic moves poorly and lost money or missed the boat.

I canât feel the confidence to drop big money into a trade.

How do I get that confidence? Here are a few questions on my mind:

1. What charts do you guys use? Ticks are better to exit sooner or Rinko are better?

2. How do you guys exit or save profits before the big drop or downward halt?

3. How do we enter into a trade after the halt?

4. What are the indicators? Pretty much everything is lagging and I see that itâs dropping in front of my eyes and I canât get a better price during the sell... or Iâll hold the bag forever.

5. Anyone using conditional orders to exit quickly? 

6. Have you guys tried the TDA API to automatically enter and exit?

7. Is there any pumping group? I see many no news runners running crazy.. not sure how people are buying in big numbers.. youâre look at 20x daily volume all of sudden .. with no catalyst.

8. Any paid indicators or scanners for these parabolic moves?

9. Looks like conditional orders based on 1m are too late.. as everyone seems to be trading ticks?

10. Any popular candle patterns or price action for the parabolic moves?

11. If you miss the waves, any short criteria?

# ES:

Month:

3705: Developing month top of traded volume. Anticipate an additional test of price in coming days with Sunday evening establishing a high for the week with it being tested in coming days if not successful on Monday or Tuesday. 

3670: Two month prior top of traded volume. Price threshold was broken in the previous day trading session (Friday) with support forming during Globex session (Sunday evening) with aggressive selling entering upon opening of European trading session. However, buyers successfully supported the 3670 price threshold. Anticipate an additional test of value during RTH or prior to Globex; if broken anticipate a return to previous week trading range until additional news related to vaccine distribution is disseminated. 

3668: Previous month (November) top of traded volume. Potential location to place a stop if entering long at 3670 depending on time horizon of trade thesis. 

Week:

3700: Previous week top of traded volume. Anticipate a test of price as it appears that RTH will be an opening auction in previous week price range with market participants attempting to determine value for the coming week. 3667: Previous week POC. Functions as a confluence regions with 3670/3668 increasing the probability that support will occur at threshold if two month prior top of traded volume is broken. 

3643: Separation of previous week volume profile with two large nodes established. If support does not occur at two month top of traded volume, then a return to price rotating between 3643 and 3670 is probable until further news related to vaccine distribution is disseminated. 

Daily:

3672.25: Previous day (Friday) bottom of traded volume. Price functioned as support during Globex session.

3700: Previous day top of traded volume. Price functioned as resistance on hourly time frame during Globex session with a break presenting on lower time frames establishing a high of 3705.

3705: Globex high.

3672.25: Globex low.

# NQ:

Month:

12468: Three month prior top fo traded volume. Price threshold was tested on numerous occasions during previous week with volume beginning to accumulate in region as indicated by previous week POC of 12475. Expect a test of price if the market opens in previous week trading range to determine trajectory for coming week.

12408:.75: Previous month top of traded. A test of threshold is feasible with it remaining within 100% of daily ATR range. However, a return to previous month trading range would be indicative of a bearish sentiment for the higher time frame sentiments. Depending on dissemination of news; price threshold may be tested this week.

Week:

12540: Previous week top of traded volume. Globex price temporarily broken threshold with two hourly candles closing above region However, upon opening of asian trading session price did not function as support with a break presenting. An additional test of threshold did not occur. It is beginning to appear that RTH will be an open auction in previous week trading range with market participants attempting to determine value for coming week.

12480: Previous week POC. Functioned as support during Globex trading session on higher time frames with the low of 12474.75 being established. If RTH is an open auction price threshold should be tested prior to a continuation higher to test Globex highs as per the precedent of previous weeks.

12344: Separation in previous week volume profile.

12086: Previous week bottom of traded volume. Price threshold test is improbable in coming week unless there is news precipitating an events resulting in selling especially with top tech companies not reporting earnings this week.

Daily:

12535.75: Previous day top of traded volume. PRice did not receive a tests indicating it being a region of interest during Globex trading.

12448: Previous day bottom of traded volume. If confluence region of previous week POC in conjunction with Globex low is broken, then a test of threshold should occur.

12572: Globex high.

12474.75: Globex low.

# GC:

Month:

1877: Previous month top of traded volume is the following threshold to be tested if current trajectory can continue since previous week. 

1857.3: Previous month bottom of fair value. Price threshold should be tested once price enters primary volume profile of previous month which begins at 1852.8.

1852.8: Separation in previous month volume profile with the majority of volume transacting above threshold. Additionally, during previous week price functioned as resistance on numerous occasions indicating that once price is broken, further upside should be feasible. Anticipate an additional test of region in coming days or potentially during RTH as it remains within 50% of daily ATR range. 

Week:

1852.7: Previous week top of traded volume. Price was not tested during Globex trading session. Although, with price opening in previous week range an open auction would indicated that a test of previous week top of traded volume is feasible once POC is broken.

1844.3: Previous week POC.Functioned as resistance during Globex trading session with brief breaks presenting creating a high of 1846.3 for the session (Asian trading) without a re-test presenting during European trading.

# CL:

Month:

46.26: Prior month top of traded volume. During previous Globex session session (Friday) price threshold was broken to the upside with prices not being sustained during RTH. Anticipate an additional test during coming week to determine value as a rejection presented during Globex trading session on the opening candle at 6PM EST.

41.42: Previous month POC. Test of threshold improbable during coming week unless news related to OPEC+ or Middle Eastern tension arises altering pricing expectations. 

44.00: Separation in previous month volume profile, which should create a price floor for the coming week. If broken, then a test of 43.43 is likely two occur (two month prior top of traded volume.

43.43: Two month prior top of traded volume. 

Week: 46.68: Previous week top of traded volume. For price threshold to be tested price during RTH should open above prior month top of traded volume for market participants to sustain continued buying.

45.22: Previous week POC with price threshold not being tested during Globex trading session. 

43.92: Previous week bottom of traded volume.

Daily: At the moment daily thresholds are not of particularly interest with previous day trading range having volume accumulate at top as well as bottom threshold resulting in the requirement of order flow confirmation for consideration of an entry. Higher time frames are preferred at the moment with lower time frame for entry. Daily levels will be posted tomorrow once adequate volume for the week is esttablished.

3667.50: Previous week POC. Price was tested during European trading session of Globex with a break occurring without support of resistance forming on higher time frames. For neutral/bullish sentiment to remain RTH should open above threshold. Although, anticipate an additional test during RTH to determine direction. If buyers enter, then expect a test of previous week high.

3643: Separation of previous week volume profile with two large nodes established. If support does not occur at two month top of traded volume. A break of the previous week POC would result in a trading range developing between 3667.50 and 3643 until further information is released. 

Daily:

3696.50: Previous day top of traded volume with a test not occurring.

3692.50: Prior day POC; test did not develop; if Globex high if broken during RTH anticipate tests of both values with a stop placed at 3700 if entering short at 3696.50.

3677.25: Previous day bottom of traded volume. Functioned as support for entire duration of Asian trading session with a break occurring during European trading with volume beginning to accumulate at threshold as support nor resistance developed.

3690: Globex high.

3664.25: Globex low.

NQ:

Month:

12468: Three month prior top fo traded volume. A test of the threshold did not present during Globex trading session. However, price remains within 100% of daily ATR indicating if selling is precipitated by news then a test is probable. Remaining above price should indicate a continuation of bullish tendencies among market participants.

12408:.75: Previous month top of traded. Depending on Globex opening of price, a test of threshold may be feasible, but improbable as it would alter temporary market sentiment as to expectations. Would indicate a return to previous month trading range.

Week:

12540: Previous week top of traded volume. Price threshold was tested during Globex trading session during European trading session where a break occurred; although, support, nor resistance developed at price. Anticipate additional tests of value during RTH with order flow confirmation necessary for entry. In conjunction with previous week top of traded volume, region is beginning to develop separation in current week profile creating the possibility of two trading ranges if broken. 

12480: Previous week POC. Price threshold was not tested during Globex trading session. If 12540 is broken by aggressive selling, then anticipate a test of the previous week POC prior to continuation higher if the sentiment remains bullish. Although, it will remain necessary for price to be supported at 12540 to prevent a rotation week.

12344: Separation in previous week volume profile.

12086: Previous week bottom of traded volume.

Daily:

12612: Previous day top of traded volume. A test did not present during Globex trading session. Appears as if RTH will be an open auction increasing probability of test if opening above prior day POC.

12588: Prior day POC. Functioned as resistance for entire duration of Globex trading session on higher time frames with breaks presenting when X<15 mins. Expect an additional test to determine trajectory for day with an open auction likely to occur during RTH.

12525.75: Prior day low; functioned as support during Globex trading session (European) with buyers entering passively supporting the market. If previous day POC is rejected at open, expect a test of previous day low/Globex.

12599: Globex high.

12527.50: Globex low.

GC:

Month:

1877: Previous month top of traded volume. As discussed during previous day market preparation. This threshold was the target for taking profits of a short entry. Price threshold was tested during Globex trading session with rejection occurring with there being absorption at price, then over 100 ticks or 10 points of selling. Expect an additional test to present during RTH once volume enters market. 

1857.3: Previous month bottom of fair value. Price threshold was broken during previous day trading with now becoming a region for support. Price was not tested during Globex trading session; however, if Globex floor is broken expect rotation between 1857.3 and 1877 while market participants decide on how /GC should be price.

1852.8: Separation in previous month volume profile with the majority of volume transacting above threshold. Functioned as resistance on numerous occasions indicating that once price is broken. Essential price threshold for market participants to remain bullish as well as to prevent neutral sentiment. 

Week:

1852.7: Previous week top of traded volume. Price was not tested during Globex trading session. A test of threshold is probable in the coming days; although, market participants are evaluating current pricing with a consolidation in range expected in the coming 24 hours prior to a large movement in price.

1844.3: Previous week POC. Price threshold is beginning to exceed 100% of daily ATR indicating low probability of test in coming days as price continues to likely consolidate.

1825: separation in previous week volume profile. Price floor for developing week.

Daily:

1873: Previous day top of traded volume. Price threshold was tested during Globex trading (Asian session) with a break presented establishing a new high. However, once European trading commenced a test did not develop until the transition to RTH.

1865.2: Previous day POC, which functioned as support during entire Globex trading session with a break presenting on time frames where X<10 minutes in conjunction with minimal volume accumulated below price. Expect additional test if previous day high is rejected. 

1837: Previous day bottom of traded volume.

1876: Globex high.

1863.9: Globex low.

CL:

Month:

46.26: Prior month top of traded volume. A test of price did not present during Globex trading session with a weak high of 45.93 being established. If Globex high if broken, the further tests are feasible. 

With the current trading range of /CL not too many particularly appealing entires with price continuing to consolidate in range as success of vaccine distribution will determine if there is further upside from demand. 

44.00: Separation in previous month volume profile, which should create a price floor for the coming week. If broken, then a test of 43.43 is likely two occur (two month prior top of traded volume.

43.43: Two month prior top of traded volume. 

41.42: Previous month POC. Test of threshold improbable during coming week unless news related to OPEC+ or Middle Eastern tension arises altering pricing expectations. 

Week: 

46.68: Previous week top of traded volume; price threshold was not tested during previous day RTH or Globex session.

Daily:

46.54: Previous day top of traded volume.

t3_ka29a4,How price seems to respect simple moving averages,"I like to set my charts up with multiple simple moving averages (SMAs). For example take the attached APPS chart with 10 minute candles which shows the price during market hours (6.5 hours per day) only. I have added the following simple moving averages:

6 period  (1 hour) - pale red

12 period (2 hours) - pale yellow

39 period (6.5h, 1day) - red

78 period (2 days) - yellow

195 period (5 days) - green

300 period (50 hours) - blue

390 period (2 weeks) - black

585 period (3 weeks) - orange

&#x200B;

[APPS 10m chart with 1h, 2h, 1 day, 2 day, 5 day, 50h, 2 week SMAs](https://preview.redd.it/y2htxxz9n8461.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bc482573b3ecac11c7f008152c2c33dd6bd8f98)

I find it uncanny how the price action seems to respect these SMAs with the lines providing support and resistance at different times.

**Commentary on the attached APPS chart:**

(1) This was election week when the whole market went crazy. Lovely run up staying above the 1 day SMA, until Friday evening when the price closed below the 1 day moving average - next day gap down.

(2) Price tests support on the 2 week SMA with the 5 day and 50 hour SMAs providing resistance above, until support on the 2 week SMA is finally broken on Mon 16th. APPS closes Mon 16th below the 1 day SMA and the next day it continues down but finds support around the 3 week SMA,

(3) Tues 17th price goes above 1 day SMA then drops back down to test it. The test holds and APPS closes above the 1 day SMA. The next day it gaps up but the break doesn't come and it drops back down. There seems to be bullish sentiment (to make it gap up), but the proper break will have to wait.

(4) After dropping massively from the gap up at the start of the day it finds support on the 3 week SMA. The support is retested at close and it holds it. The next day (Thu 19), after a volatile opening it finally finds support above the 1 day SMA and rallies until it finds resistance at the 2 week SMA.

(5) the resistance from the 2 week SMA is retested and it breaks it to close the day just above the 2 week SMA. The next day it rallies and continues the uptrend on Mon 23. For whatever reason it gaps down the next but eventually hold above the 2 week SMA at close.

(6) It opens above the 1 day SMA, but drops to find support on the 2 week SMA. At this point the 1 day, 50 hour, 2 week and 3 week SMAs have all converged. Once support on the 2 week SMA is confirmed with a green candle that engulfs the 4 previously mentioned SMA, APPS is off for a 20% run over the next 3 days!

**Conclusions (not just from this chart, but from all charts I've applied this set up on)**

\-It only works with simple moving averages (ie not exponential moving averages - see other attached pics with EMAs instead of SMAs)

&#x200B;

[APPS 10m chart with EMS](https://preview.redd.it/smaujqedn8461.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccc2a7d1b3b9c49f9aa0606272bf32b8f3983f77)

\-It works best when the periods represent the following time lengths: 1h, 2h, 1/2 day, 1 day, 2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months etc. You need to note how many periods make up a day on the particular chart you apply it to to make sure you get the right number of periods. For example there are 6.5 hours in a trading day on the NYSE, but if your chart shows after hours trading and pre-market trading then there will be 16 hours in a day. Also if you use an hourly chart remember there are 7 hourly candles in one day so 1 week is 35 periods (7\*5) not 32.5 (6.5\*5). You can apply the same principles to lots of charts, the ones I use most are - 10s, 1m, 10m, 1h, 1 day and 1 week.

\-When, for example, a down trend reverses, watch out for SMAs above providing resistance. Take the TSLA example attached where I bought the dip on todays sell off. I was conscious of the SMAs above my buy providing resistance. There was resistance initially at the 30 min SMA (green), but then it held the 20 min SMA (yellow). It went over the 50 min SMA (blue) and found support on it. It went through the 1 hour SMA (purple), and then hit resistance at the 2 hour SMA (black) - that was my cue to take profit, only 2.5% but for 15 mins work with a big enough position size if I could do that every day I'd be laughing!

\-The biggest runs come from periods when the multiple moving averages are converged and a single candle engulfs a number of moving averages.

What do you think? I'd like to hear other peoples views on using multiple SMAs. Am I just seeing what I want to see?

Yesterday all the markets ended up closing in the red. The Nasdaq fell about 2%.

Worth noting there was an anti-trust lawsuit filed against FB but it followed the market. No significant sell-off.

Yesterday's hot IPO, DASH, which is a COVID play didn't disappoint. Keeping an eye on ABNB which is a post-COVID play.

The PFE vaccine will have its public hearing. Emergency use authorization could come as soon as today. Canada gave approval yesterday.

Futures are flat, the VIX spiked some. I'm still bullish but cautiously so. One red day doesn't change anything.

We are gapping down into the 20 ma. We have plenty of room to fall if this support breaks. I say if because this is a strong market that gets pumped up with every fade. I will be very cautious today and will only be trading names with HIGH volume if I make any trades at all. I will stay cautious until trades start giving more follow through and when the market starts acting more orderly. Good luck out there and have a good weekend. See you all Monday.

### Market Notes:

Market's are still going absolutely crazy in my opinion. The IPOs of DASH and ABNB show that. Along with some crazy runners this week, **GLSI** and **SLS**.

But the overall markets are beginning to turn. The **VIX** started climbing on Wednesday and is flying in the premarket as futures are falling.

Big news stories of the week include jobless claims rising, COVID-19 deaths spiking, **PFE** vaccine is ready for emergency use authorization. With the vaccine several months off, the negatives could give the bears an edge at least in the short term.

I'm watching for the dip to get bought. If the selling continues at the open we could be in for a bumpy couple of weeks.

I've been reading and learning about daytrading since the first lockdown, and despite having some consistency and success paper trading and trading with small capital (<Â£1000), I am still not too sure how reliable and repeateable daytrading is in the long run.  To make matters worse, I went down a rabbit hole of watching Anton Kreil's videos on YouTube, where he essentially just slates daytraders, and says that TA is nonesense.  He argues that it is all about managing portfolios and requiring substantial capital (minimum of $25-50k) to even consider making any financial gains.  To be honest, I just feel a little deflated because I have spent so many hours learning how to daytrade (I still suck, but I am learning), I have been putting money aside, and I have even planned on daytrading full-time when I am consistent enough and have enough experience (even if it is just a normal, liveable wage).  But after watching his videos the past few days, I find myself going back to my charts and thinking ""is any of this even real, or am I just wasting my time trying to get this to work?"".

I just wanted to share this with you guys and try get feedback from yourselves.  So, is Anton Kreil's philosophy legit? Like, is TA and daytrading in general.. pointless? If not, how do you know? Do you have proof? As he argues that everyone who claims to be successful is full of shit and is just trying to make money off of you.. which let's be honest, is a hefty majority of these 'traders'.

t3_kc0osk,Confidence in trading strategy?,"Question for any full time traders doing it for a living. When do losing days stop rocking your confidence in your strategy and future profitability? 

I started intraday trading in March. 42k account trading equities only. Made 10k by April, then lost 28k by the end of May. Back to the sim in June- tweaked my strategy (prefer not to get into specifics, but somewhat of a hyperscalper), changed brokers, and reduced position size. Back at it with real money in July and it all started to click. 

Am currently up about 350% since then (132k in profits). Took a leave of absence from my FT job in September and plan to quit completely early 2021 to try my hand at trading for a living. I make between 250 and 1000 trades a day with a 1:1 R/R and a 60-65% win rate. This is a substantial sample size to give ample evidence that Iâll have success going forward from a statistical perspective, but I still find every time I have a red day my confidence is shot and I question everything until I string together a week or so of green days. That red day always feels like the beginning of the end. 

Did anyone else experience this, and if so, when did it go away, if ever? My sense is that this is part of the psychological warfare that is trading, but am hoping it does go away or at least reduces with time. 

I realize my timeline is a bit condensed and that may be adding to my sense of insecurity, but wanted to see what others experienced in their journeys to trading for a living.

**2.** The blue line is the Daily 100 SMA. It has proven 3 times now to be support, you can bet other traders will be watching it. Great place to try a long with stop below it.


**How will I trade this?**
I went short when the [headline came out about FTC suing FB came out.](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) So I'm already in. My average price is $280, I have my stop at break even there now. I'll let this ride since I have a comfortable entry.

*If I wasn't short,* the two plays I would consider:

[**Bullish play**:](https://i.ibb.co/r2ZGmFZ/fbbull.png) I would be watching for a bounce off the orange trend line/100 SMA daily to go long around $270 and a stop below the most recent higher low $264. (Might've already missed this entry at Friday's low of 270.25) Price target would be scale out at top of the wedge, ATH $304, and hold for a new ATH breakout.

[**Bearish play:**](https://i.ibb.co/BNK8Sfs/fb-bear.jpg) I would look to go short right at a break below $268. That would be well below the unbroken 100 SMA. Price target would be $246.



The question is... what will it take to bust through the 100 SMA/wedge bottom? Are the recent lawsuits enough, or more headlines or developments? Will news fizzle out and the 100 test already happened, and will hold again?

t3_kdf4gv,"Relfection on three trades from today, on accidental 3M charts. Happens. 1 winner and 2 losers $AMZN $NVAX $TSM","Today was interesting, mainly because I unknowingly made the rookie mistake of trading off of the 3min chart instead of the 5m. I didn't catch it until tonight when I came back to review trades. I do like the 3min for open, but I have been skipping open for a few weeks now and am mostly a 5m/10m/1h chart trader. 

&#x200B;

[$AMZN 3m](https://preview.redd.it/9c8ktqkb1a561.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e8a3ad363c3cbac9300ba891138b3dc8aa635d9)

$SPY was heading lower and $AMZN was flagging after being rejected for a second higher high on lower volume. MACD down, Stoch down, RSI down. I drew a few trendlines to help my decision, but unfortunately was not quick enough to get my stop limit set and entered with a stop (I put stops for entry in initially because is that is how my default brackets are set up, I then edit them to stop limits for better fills (sometimes no fills)). My fill as bad as there is a large spread on $AMZN.  I took profit below VWAP for 2R and some change, with more not ideal fills. 

[TSM 3m](https://preview.redd.it/qghxunlz3a561.png?width=1459&format=png&auto=webp&s=66894088dd4cdfc36816073686dc7739eb670e8b)

This one I saw price wicking support on increasing volume. I entered at the break of support / pre-market highs but also due to the 3m chart I assume, I was over anticipating the move and couldn't get my stop limit in so bad fill again. MACD turning up but choppy, stochastic up, RSI ranging. I put my stoploss below my entry bar since the fill made my R:R trickier to make work, I would have needed an 80c for 2R if I put my stop under the lowest recent wick and 20EMA cloud where I originally planned. I didn't see TSM making a huge move today just a pop with the way the market was performing. I was stopped out, for a small loss, In hindsight I should of just left this ticker alone due to volume, or traded short for the midday fade after the lower low / triple top. 

[NVAX 3m](https://preview.redd.it/ahew5ukd5a561.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3f0fcd48bbf3878f56effdb650011d3b6ea48a)

Same deal, drew trends that made sense to me. Took $NVAX short on the break of the trend, my stop was 130.30. We actually hit 2R on this trade, but I had my limit to cover at the red line (prior support from yesterday and personal approx 6R target), which wasn't hit until later. A good lesson for me, because I put this trade on and then headed to work and was stopped out. When AFK it may be better to trail my trades instead of stop/limit if I am going for above 2R targets. That way my stop is automatically moved to breakeven. I haven't decided how to handle this, as I generally have bad luck with trailing stops. The reason I was going for 6R is just that I chose to trade a technical target instead of R and I had a short bias on $NVAX for today, which happened to be 6R. I always make sure each trade has the potential to move to at least 2R but I prefer 3R+ with ideal entry. If I was at my computer I would of scaled out 1/2 or 1/4 at 2R. Oh well.

However, I traded 12 different tickers by the EOD. 5 Winners 5 Losers, and 2 cancels (both slight gains). Some of my winners did not hit 2R as I generally plan, I moved stops up and had trouble finding market direction. Maybe I drank coffee too early this morning but I was not focused on my rules, so today I forced myself to run a mile for breaking my rules. I hate running, and I worked 10 hours on my feet all day delivering packages for UPS. This punishment will make me think twice about breaking rules next time.

Simple trade here, midday fade. I waited for volume to fade off, lower indicators to all 3 turn down, and entered on the break of a pinbar (not textbook pinbar but was good enough for me). I set my target at VWAP and left it in brackets. I could have gotten a bit more and managed this differently, but I was headed to work when it triggered, so I was happy with 3R on this trade.

Bearish open, held support, and momentum shifted. I missed the first entry, so I looked for a second.  I entered on an above-average volume bar, I had to chase a few cents because my fill was skipped. I set a tighter stop due to this to adjust risk. All 3 indicators supported the lower move. I scaled out roughly half my shares at the 50MA (deep purple line), and the rest at the premarket high. I could have taken more of this too but was happy with 2.5R and I also have a bit of this stock in my IRA so if the move would of went higher I'd be happy knowing I captured it there.

I'll be honest on this one, someone called this out in the group I trade-in, and I took it without confirming. This trade is part of why I had to run tonight. I have a rule that if a trade is suggested I must analyze the chart, see the trade, agree with the daily thesis, and use no more than 1/2 size. I used full size and bought into morning momentum with what looked like a pullback at the time. I had 0 supporting lower indicators, and I was using pre-market highs as a resistance, which didn't work out. I've learned this lesson before, but today I received a refresher. -1.5R due to slippage and mis sizing my trade. 

&#x200B;

I strongly suggest using similar rules when following trades on Twitter, Discord, Reddit, wsb, or whatever. Trades feel so much better, even losses when they are your own. When you follow someone, you naturally blame them. You are the only one to blame for your actions, and you're the only one who has to see your account p/l at the end of the day/week/month or whatever. The trick is to actually follow those rules, and remember everyone is right at some point, ESPECIALLY in bull markets. Don't fall into the trap of worshiping gurus, always do your own DD and make sure you understand why they think it is a good trade. My trade was an example of what not to do, and how even though I have learned this less and lost with much larger size, (I lost $65 on this, whereas I have lost over 3k on suggested trades in the past when I was undisciplined), I can still be reminded.",7,1.0,1608181570,"[['EBAY', 1], ['wsb', 1]]",EBAY,52.439998626708984,51.2400016784668

# Gameplan:

We've been trading in a channel for the better part of a month now. These moves normally end with a bang. Either a large sell-off or a melt-up outside the upper part of the channel. In the meantime, until we sell-off below the channel, we should continue to ride the wave. All pullbacks are buyable.

Yesterday we saw the tightest daily range in a while. 1.41 points to be exact. I will look for the range to continue to be between 1.5 and 3.5 in the future. We're now gapping slightly lower, however, this provides the market with some time to cool off (66 RSI on 1D & 65 RSI on hourly). Anywhere in the area of **369** presents a solid buying opportunity early in the AM. If we sell off all day, **367.60** looks appealing as well.

t3_kgeyh0,Some trading content for this sub.,"Seems like this sub is just a bunch of newbies asking questions so I am going to try and share some of my trades and make this a routine. Maybe this will encourage other traders to share as well. I would upload the charts but I don't see how to do that with text. If you want to follow along I suggest bringing up charts 5 and 1 minute of the stocks so you can see what I'm referencing.

Background: I trade small cap/low float momentum strategies and usually trade the leading gappers in the overall market.

&#x200B;

First trade on Friday: 12/18

First stock was CYTH. I usually trade using 5 and 1 min charts side by side. I saw this gapper break over VWAP and hold on a low volume red candle at 9:15 (buy signal). I then watched the 1 min chart looking for a break over 8.40 and hoping for a move past 8.50. My stop here is a move back below 8.25.

Enter: 9:23:15 500 $8.350 

Exit: 9:23:21 -500 $8.470 

As you can see I held this position for only 6 seconds. I had a red day yesterday and this was literally my first trade so I wanted to ensure profit, after there was a very fast rip up to like 8.60 I just wanted to take my money off the table and see if it held above 8.50 where I could reconsider getting back in. I actually got a horrible fill and you can see I didn't get filled until 8.47 but still walking away with profit. It ended up failing to hold and dropped below 8.25 and I didn't like it again all day.

&#x200B;

Second trade on Friday: 12/18

Second stock was SQFT. Strong bounce off VWAP at around 10AM and it caught my eye after it broke all time high of 8.28. The 5 min chart is a little extended but there is a perfect 1 min pullback that forms. The stock breaks the whole dollar and appears to hold above it. So I am looking for a move up to 9.25-9.50 after I buy shares as close to $9 as possible.

Enter: 10:12:56 SQFT 500 $9.050

Exit: 10:13:39 SQFT -500 $9.180

This position I held for about a minute watching level 2 to see that it keeps easily making new highs. Super unfortunate I got a bad fill again here, I was looking to take profit at 9.75 but I didn't get filled and it flushed back down fast. Can't help but think I should have more profit after these 2 trades. But I chalk it up to stocks not really holding their breakouts and I decide I don't like anything else today.",5,0.65,1608407662,"[['SQFT', 2]]",SQFT,4.059999942779541,4.989999771118164
t3_kh10k8,Does Trade Station Global have Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule?,"Okay, so here's the scenario. Trade Station Global accounts are linked with Interactive Brokers accounts. So, I already have an IB account. Although I don't live in the US but IB tells me that all accounts from my country are put under the IB-US entity, hence, PDT is applied to my account. 

Now, if I go to Trade Station Global and link my current IB account with it, will I still have PDT applied to my account which I'll be trading on Trade Station Global or not? 

Can somebody clear this up for me? If someone has come across a similar case and knows the answer to this, I'd be appreciative. 

My guess is all the countries that come under their Asia-Mideast region are put under IB-US and residents of those countries will also have PDT applied to their accounts. So if anyone from those countries is here who has connected their account with Trade Station Global would probably be able to tell me accurately.

Hello everyone. Putting a feeler out there if anyone would be interested if I posted a swing trade opportunity every week. I am a profitable day trader, 2 years running. 2021 will be my fourth year day trading. I trade using simple TA. I try to journal most of my trades so I can see where I've gone wrong or right. I've attached a sample trade I posted in my personal discord, to give you guys an idea. I can gladly post a lot more. Also I'm not looking to profit off anyone and my discord is free/empty.

t3_kgujdx,âBuying the dipâ using Standard Deviation,"So after buying the dip only to see it keep dipping, I backtested some indicators to see if I could find a way to determine if there was some way of knowing how much the bottom had left to give out before we saw a real reversal. Did not take long for me to find out.

[Here is an album with a graphical representation of the strategy and indicates, my trade percentage average and my plays since 11/30](https://imgur.com/gallery/i6jRFVV). Please refer to the guide because itâs relevant to the details below.

Please note that the trades with >15% losses were not using the strategy. That was me testing out buying options in the final thirty minutes on SPY OPEX days which Iâm working to refine for options scalping.

Details:

It uses the 15 minute time frame and a combination of RSI (14,close,normal) and the StandardDeviation(Close,14)

1) We are looking for oversold conditions as indicated by the oval at (2) where RSI crosses below 30 on RSI(14) on the 5 minute time frame

The standard deviation line at this point has to originate from the bottom near as shown on the chart above (1). We are looking for a relative magnitude of the standard deviation from valley to peak. Notice its slope, or the tangent of the triangle shown in (3). The point in which we slope down (4) is where the price action tends to sway up, relative in duration to the timeframe and which these indicators are forming.

An optimal entry is shown at (3) where the SD has peaked. The standard deviation tends to flatten out at these relative percentage changes (i.e a flat of .08 to a peak of .24 is a relative percentage change of 300%)

1 min time frame: 500-600%
5 min time frame: 350-500%
10-15 min time frame: 200-300%
30 min time frame: 150-250%

These are good values to know in case you feel comfortable being predictive to the price movement rather than reactive. But, in my live trading of this strategy, I have noted it is never wrong to wait for confirmation of the SD line flattening. While you can miss some initial gains, it does a great job of avoiding further losses while still maintaining respectable upside movement.

In this instance here, I had a nearly 0.3 point move in just two minutes, and a 0.8 move in fifteen minutes. My testing has shown that an average of 0.5 delta move swings occur after seven minutes

Also-- I should add, the higher rate of change of standard deviation from the bottom of the rise the better.

So where do I apply this? Scalping call options. What helps me get the âLODâ relative to the incoming bounce is to underbid the contract by 20-40% (higher underbidding if less DTE. I do this with weeklies). And I have had success getting to the lowest bid price within 2-5%, but the upside is on average 30% above my bid. However, I settle for 5% because I do not wish to continue risking my capital (I typically go in with 60% at a time).

Hope this is helpful to anyone. Back testing this strategy is critical to using it correctly, and you might find other trend reversal indicators would help it be more dependable. Iâm looking to add linear regression lines this week and see how that helps.",6,0.64,1608473146,"[['RSI', 2], ['SD', 2]]",RSI,20.18000030517578,25.399999618530273
t3_kgjsnf,Some thoughts on learning to trade,"I wrote this response on another thread ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/kghapu/share\_your\_success\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/kghapu/share_your_success_story/)), but I figured it might add enough value to warrant its own post. I hope it helps someone:

Started learning about trading in late 2018, thought it was something that fit my natural aptitude well so I decided to dedicate myself to it and went full-time in September 2019, and have been continually improving since then.

I'm a very obsessive person by nature so I have spent (and continue to spend - here I am writing this novel on a Saturday night...) a *lot* of time thinking, learning, observing, and, most importantly, interacting with the market. Over time things have become clearer. I encourage you to spend an adequate amount of time in sim and trading small before scaling up.

It's interesting how you say ""made it"" because I view it more as an ongoing process than a destination. A professional trader makes his career a success with every trade that he puts on.  He's good at winning and good at losing. I view my edge to be my experience and knowledge and that edge is lost if I start to mess up on my analysis and/or execution. To me it's about continually striving to do the ""right thing"" even when it feels uncomfortable or as though it isn't the right thing to do. For example, on Friday (12/18/2020) the ES towards the end of the session formed another spike and channel bear trend (as it had done earlier in the day as well) and was stair-stepping down (meaning that it kept trading above prior breakout points). I put a limit order to buy at a measured move projection based on the height of the spike because I saw sufficient bullishness on the way down. That wound up being 1 tick above the low of the day (certainly not saying that a trader needs to pick tops and bottoms to be successful). I did not expect the strength of the rally that followed, but I did have sufficient evidence to think that lower prices had been shutting off selling. So even though the market was going down, my analysis told me to buy it because it was more likely that there were going to be stronger buyers than sellers at lower prices. It can feel like it's wrong to buy a falling market, but sometimes that's exactly the more reasonable thing to do. Other times it isn't. Knowing the difference is critical.

I think one of the best things a trader can do is learn to understand market behavior. It is the repetition in behavior that we're trying to take advantage of by structuring trades where the balance between risk, reward, and probability is reasonable. The other important benefit of doing so is that if a trade goes sour it's easier to discern whether it did due to poor execution on the trader's part or the behavior not playing out as expected. Utilizing these sorts of feedback loops is important so that you can figure out ways to continually improve your trading. Treat it as a skill and practice deliberately. Train as though you're an athlete. Break down the pieces and build it back up so that you understand things from the ground up. Figure out where your weaknesses are and work on fixing them. There are many variations of how things can play out in the market, so in my experience it is best to use a principles-based approach that adapts strategies to the market conditions in relation to the overall context. This not only significantly increases the number of opportunities but also, in my view, not needing any particular conditions in order to be able to trade profitably is a mark of a true professional trader. I believe everyone should aim for that level of understanding and skill if they're striving to earn a full-time living from trading.

There is an analytical, managerial, and psychological component to trading. It's most important to spend time on learning how to read the market and manage trades. The psychological component is overblown, especially amongst beginners, and I think that many of the issues that people describe are actually a result of not having trading skills rather than having psychological hang ups. Once you do learn the skills of successful trading though, working on improving mental management certainly does help improve overall performance.

There isn't a specific path to follow. I learned by doing. Many times it has felt like a Sisyphean task. It is important to always be honest with yourself and critical of what you're doing. One more thing worth mentioning, when I learned to trade I barely ever looked at trading forums. I read a lot of books, watched lectures/webinars, but most importantly tested ideas for myself, and figured out what worked for me. Learning to trade is *hard* and the process is self-guided, I think it's up to each person to decide whether he or she is willing to do whatever is necessary to be successful. If you're not a confident, intelligent, self-motivated person then I'd recommend spending your time going to some sort of grad school or doing something else with your life where the path is clearly laid out and very well-traveled. If you are willing to persist, trading is definitely worthwhile. And remember, statistics apply to populations not necessarily to individuals. The statistic may be that 90%+ of ""traders"" fail, but that doesn't mean there's a 90% chance that you will if you're willing to truly work at it and are more diligent with it than the more casual participants.",9,0.72,1608424067,"[['ES', 1]]",ES,82.16999816894531,85.0999984741211

â¢ President Donald Trump, in a stunning Tuesday night tweet, called the $900 billion Covid relief bill passed by Congress an unsuitable âdisgrace.â

â¢ He urged lawmakers to make a number of changes to the measure, including bigger direct payments to individuals and families.

â¢ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of Trumpâs political arch enemies, agreed with his call for $2,000 payments.

â¢ Trump did not threaten a veto. He had been expected to sign the legislation into law, along with a $1.4 trillion spending bill to keep the government open. Congress passed the measure with veto-proof majorities.

2. If the lines are above the zero line, that indicates an upward momentum and vice versa?

3. The further the candles are away from the 200 EMA, the higher the price?

4. Is there a way or indicator to enter at the lowest price on a candle? Or is limit order usually the best option?

I have read quite a few books, watched a lot of youtube content, scavenged through many of the subreddits. But I've never really been successful. 

Now I am starting to think that there is no living to be made out of this. I dont understand how anyone could make a living out of this. 

Also I do think that for some reason the players with big big money are the only ones who make money in the long term. The winners are only the ones who dont get wiped out. And also I have a crude logic supporting the claim. So I came across this statistic that more than 90% of the people dabbling in the market lose their money. Most of the money that the 90% lose has to go to the 10%. So the money 90% are betting = money 10% bet. which means that the capital of the 10% actual winners is huge.

# Gameplan:

We finally managed to hold a Monday gap, and now we're set to do it again. Range has been very tight the past week which is good news for bulls who want to see the market slowly grind higher. Yesterday saw new all-time highs but backed off a bit into the close. This is still bullish behavior & the gap up this morning is confirming.

Lots of support for the bulls between **371.80** and **372.59**. If they crack this area, we could be headed down to fill what I'm calling the Santa Claus gap. Normally I'd look for some sort of gap and go with a cross back through the open, however, range has been so tight that it will take a near ATR move just to fill the gap. In this kind of environment, it can be tough to daytrade the SPY and you may have turn positions into an overnight swing. Pick your entries wisely!

âLate Tuesday, the House of Representatives voted to pass a bill increasing the stimulus checks to $2,000 from $600, as Trump had demanded last week. However, it remains unclear when or whether the GOP-controlled Senate would take up the bill for a vote. And many Republican members of the chamber previously opposed any payment sum greater than that already included in the $900 billion stimulus package.

Stimulus developments aside, U.S. equities are also likely benefiting from the seasonal period deemed the âSanta Claus rally,â which extends over the final five trading days of the year and into the first two sessions of the new year. Over the past 50 years, stocks have ended this period higher 77.9% of the time, and with an average gain of 1.33% for one of the best seven-day periods of the year, according to LPL Financial.

The three major indices are also set to post strong returns this year, after rallying strongly off of their lows in March and flipping from bear to bull market with record velocity. As of Mondayâs close, the S&P 500 was heading toward a 15.6% rise in 2020, the Dow for a 6.5% advance, and the Nasdaq for a staggering 44% jump as Big Tech and software stocks outperformed for much of the year.â Emily McCormick

t3_km4ca7,This shit is Bananas (Vent),"Had to vent somewhere. 

Watched RIOT for a week or so. Saw the moonshot coming (a hunch really) but missed it while I was at work and not checking my phone. Went from a couple bucks to around $10.XX.

I knew it would continue to rise, so I threw a grand at it. 

Immediately tanks minutes after I buy in. I'm not at my stop loss, so I stay in. 

I go to bed that night remembering what I read on here ""If you don't sell before end of day, you're not a Day Trader you're an investor."" 

I had to work for a few days and decided to stay in, but remained watchful. I noticed for a few minutes a day it jumps up to break even.

On my day off, I watch it like a hawk and sell. Get my grand back plus $5. *Feels Good Man*

Enjoyed the holidays, but the entire time it's eating at me that I've got a grand sitting in my account not working for me.

Go to work all day. Decide I'm going to throw that grand back onto RIOT on my next day off.

Come home from work today to see that ship has sailed.

I can't shake the feeling of what could have been. *Feels Bad Man*",7,0.9,1609206642,"[['RIOT', 2]]",RIOT,14.1899995803833,18.66900062561035
t3_kn9z5y,Which paper trading platform should I use? - Beginner Trader,"Hi all, newbie here. 

Just finished reading ""How to Day Trade for a Living"" by Andrew Aziz and want to take trading seriously. Have tried using different free paper trading platforms like: 

1) Questrade IQ Edge - their VWAP study is messed up and unusable? Probably a bug. Their quotes are also delayed by a day

2) Think or Swim - good platform overall but the quotes are delayed by 20 minutes, making my order entry and exits impossible to manage (as they're executed on real time data) 

3) WeBull - Bugs. Could even enter the stock symbol in the order entry panel

I use a brand new Mac so its probably not my computers fault lol and I don't mind paying for a decent simulator for several months so I can at least practice before moving onto trading with real money. 

Anyone have any good recommendations? Thanks in advance!

p.s. I'm Canadian and would probably trade with either Interactive Broker or Questrade when Im confident enough to trade with real money!",3,1.0,1609359772,"[['IQ', 1]]",IQ,17.1200008392334,17.56999969482422

Tuesdayâs moves lower came after prospects that consumers might receive bigger direct checks to stoke spending appeared to diminish. Though House of Representatives passed a measure to increase stimulus checks to $2,000 to most Americans, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scuttled Democratic senatorsâ efforts to quickly advance the payment increase in the Senate on Tuesday. He also suggested the chamber would only consider the measure in tandem with other provisions unpopular with Democratic lawmakers.

Trading volume among U.S. equities has been relatively light during this holiday-shortened week, and equity trading on U.S. exchanges will close all day on Friday for New Yearâs Day. With Congressâs $900 billion stimulus bill passed and few notable economic releases and no major earnings releases left on the docket for 2020, investors have attempted to look ahead for new market catalysts.
