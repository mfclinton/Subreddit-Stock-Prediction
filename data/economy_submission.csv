t3_1u5zxa,The top issues that concern the majority of economists in respect to the US economy.,"Semi-new here to reddit, still learning reddi-quette, so please forgive me if this is not formatted properly. I am interested to know what the majority of economists, as opposed to politicians, are concerned with in respect to the US economy in the coming year. [Here is one article]( http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2013/12/15/The-Issue-2014-should-be-a-good-year-for-economy/UPI-52701387101660/) I found that predicted decent growth in 2014, although they were concerned with the possibility of a stock market correction that could lead to a mini-recession. Seeing as how the stock market has achieved new record highs, and has seen [4.5 years of record growth](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gurucentral/2013/09/24/why-you-should-prepare-for-a-stock-market-correction/), I have wondered about this myself.   ",23,0.94,1388597585.0

Also they were talking about how the debt consists of bonds we have not paid back. Why do we keep selling bonds if we cannot pay back the ones we have already sold?

t3_1ue53l,Is gold / silver a good investment at the moment?,"A family member is busy putting all of their money into physical silver, as well as physical gold (but less gold). This person expects to make major returns, but I am concerned that they are wasting their money and will take major losses.

This person is an avid follower of Mike Maloney, GATA and the like, and they expect the federal debt ""bubble"" to burst presently, forcing the collapse of the US and then world economy, and then a massive spike in the value of gold, and silver.

According to Mike Maloney and GATA, there has been massive fraud and price manipulation on gold, with the stated ""paper"" gold supply outstripping the physical gold stocks through mechanisms like gold leasing.

They also expect the BRICS nations to stop using the dollar, and create their own currency, backed by gold.

This seems a bit on the conspiritard side of the fence to me, and I would like to find some *reputable* sources where I can educate myself as to the real state of:

- How much paper vs how much physical gold is out there?
- Is there any proof of price fixing on gold?
- How much debt is the US economy really in, and how will it be paid back?
- Will BRICS create their own currency? If so, would it be backed by gold?
- What is the long term forecast on Silver? What are the underlying factors in the silver price?

t3_1ufolh,"Trying to learn more about the economy in my own time, can anyone help me out?","So these are some questions that came up while I was trying to read up on some stuff. To me reading about the economy is like jumping into a series without watching the first few seasons. Anyways, here are my questions:

-How is the European Union and the idea of unity economically beneficial when it comes to trade? (Example: How would a country like France benefit trade-wise by being in the EU rather than being independent.)

-What are subsidies and how do they affect the population?

-Why do some poor/third world countries (e.g. Bolivia) have very valuable resources yet don't grow? What examples of corruption impede growth?

-Which is the most efficient country economically, environmentally, and financially speaking where each of their policies produces a growing economy with neither one interfering with each other? Is it possible to reach a perfect model? 

-Is the way in which each government founded a factor for these things, and if so why don't more governments reframe their constitutions (if that's where the problem lies) or start from scratch or fix policies to build up a more effective system?

-How does the nationalization of water or fuel affect economies? What does it mean for us regular people?

-Why are banks so important in economy? (You must understand that to me they're just buildings that store your money. Can anyone give me perspective?)

-The very rich benefit from the resources because of stocks

-What would happen if we lived in a world of equal income among everyone regardless of job, but we had the freedom we currently have?

-""A massive hike in world oil prices left foreign banks awash in petro-dollars. Here were the international banks with billions of dollars and nowhere to earn interest on it."" Can someone explain this to me? It's about the hyperinflation in Bolivia during the 80's.

ONE PLANET  
FINITE RESOURCES  
INCREASING POLLUTION  
BANKRUPT ECONOMIES  
MANIPULATED MARKETS  


Finance is just a game played between people to control resources and each other. Money and debt are the tools used for control in finance games. The control mechanisms are simple, money can only be created by bank loans while society uses the military, courts, and police enforce bank debts. However, if bankers don't continuously make sufficient new loans, not enough money is created to service growing interest obligations causing debts to fail. 

The failure to make sufficient new loans occured in 2008.  An unprecedented number of loans defaulted and the entire financial system collapsed. The game was rescued by government using massive public borrowing and obligations to bail out private banks and wealthy people. The poor did not benefit much as they had little or no financial assets to rescue. Since 2008, economic and environmental conditions have deteriorated for many around the world. As wealth concentrates in fewer hands, the highly leveraged financial game must fail again. But this time around, the rules of money will change because wealth is now interconnected between everyone due to the unprecedented rise in public debts and obligations.",9,0.61,1389201431.0

t3_1v4cqs,"Is the human factor in markets becoming irrelevant in a world increasingly relying on automated production, HFT trading, and banks creating obligations on people that are too big to fail?","As technology automates the traditional activities of life, and environmental constraints puts limits on our behavior, society needs to upgrade its systems and create new games for people to play. 

Finance is simply a game people play to control resources and each other. Money and debt are the tools used for control. Currency is what modern money is called and it can only be created through debts involving banks.  The banks make loans to persons, corporations or governments and the military, the courts, and the police are used to enforce debts. Currency, called promisory notes, is the evidence of those debts called and what people trade for value.

People have to labor, beg, borrow, or steal for the notes that the banks can create out of thin air.  To keep the game going bankers must continuously make sufficient new loans in order for there to be enough currency in circulation to service debts. Without creating new money to pay accumulating new interest, it becomes mathematically impossible to meet contractual obligations.

The failure to make sufficient new loans occurred in between 2005 and 2007. An unprecedented number of loans defaulted causing the entire financial system to collapse. The game was rescued by government using massive public borrowing and obligations to bail out primarily private banks, private corporations, and wealthy people. Even though public borrowing is a collective liability, the poor and middle class did not benefit very much from the bailout as they had little or no financial assets to rescue.  

To add insult to injury, private debt obligations were not satisfied by this massive public commitment causing many to be removed from the games and suffer.  Moreover, now that the banks are too big to fail, they can act with essentially little or no meaningful consequence regardless of behavior. Going forward, as banks keep cutting back on lending and wealth concentrates in fewer hands, the highly leveraged financial game must fail again. But this time around, the rules of the game must change because debt is now interconnected due to the unprecedented rise in public debts and obligations.",12,0.87,1389635551.0

t3_1v6tey,Our Financial Balloon Is Running Out Of Air,"Think of our financial system as a big hot air balloon which we are all passengers riding along. Our promises are what keep the hot air balloon afloat and we call those promises money. Money is simply the promisory notes that are created from bank loans and we trade those notes for value between ourselves. We call those notes currency. If promises can't be fulfilled, than our financial balloon can't remain afloat.

When banks lend money creating currency, banks only lend principal but each loan has an interest obligation attached to it. In order for the interest component to be able to be satisfied systemically, banks must make enough NEW loans to keep the system functioning just like a balloon always needs new air to remain afloat. If banks fail to make enough NEW loans, the promises fail, debt collapses, and our financial system crashes to the ground just like a hot air balloon that does not have sufficient fuel to stay afloat.

As efficient technology and automation reduce the need for people to labor and capital for production, it's becoming impossible for banks to make enough legitimate NEW loans to keep our financial system afloat anymore. Unless we all get off this ride soon and transform money, it will not be much longer before our financial balloon crashes to the ground for everyone.

As more people, businesses and governments can't fulfill their promises, we will start getting angry at each other. As the anger rises, frustration will turn to violence as typical human greed is easy to anticipate. Since the bankers can now print their own promises without recourse, they will sit back and watch the games they created, and few will ever realize how they were just passengers riding on a balloon engineered to crash.

t3_1w2k7i,Economists are fundamentalists who believe in money instead of in Jesus.,"[As with every society that has ever existed, our economy is not only a conglomerate, but a part of, and dependent upon, a huge number of values, rules, systems, and characteristics that comprise a culture. We can no more isolate the use of money or labor from these factors than we could declare society to be henceforth based on the free lunch.

Fortunately, economists discovered money as an organizing principle rather than, say, defecation. Otherwise we would have a really gross national product.

An era that has been devoted to the free market has simultaneously been the most intrusive in our history. In the name of a free market we have indentured ourselves to a government overflowing in other regards with contempt for personal liberty. In many ways, concepts such as the ""market economy"" and ""monetarism"" have actually gilded the lily of power they pretend to oppose. They provide a comfortable cover for what the government has really been about.

Thatcher wrapped herself in economic slogans that justified greed not only to accomplish economic ends but also to deal with gays and abortions and everything else she didn't like. In her paradigm, the free market and Victorian tyranny formed a civil union. By the time Reagan, Bush, and Clinton were through with the concept, they had created a gaping corporate exemption from common morality and decency. The market not only offered adequate justification for any act, it had replaced God as the highest source of law.

Until the Reagan-Bush-Clinton-Bush era it would have been next to impossible to find a culture that survived for long believing that the unfettered, rapacious flow of money and goods was the core of human existence. Elsewhere, to be sure, commerce had looked to bottom lines, but these had included those established by church, community, government, and tradition.

Behind much of our angst is an economy that has separated even its own practitioners from the support, sense, discipline, and integrity that comes from blending one's ambitions and values with those of others and from knowing and accepting that in economics, as in ecology, there is still no free lunch.](http://prorev.com/pocket.htm#culture)",2,0.6,1390603346.0

If I need food today, Im buying it now - the price in 2 years does not matter.  I am a forced buyer

Also, a lower price point would not matter, because many times that would increase demand, and thereby stabilize the supply/demand.

It basically just seems like a protection scheme for capital good valuations that is counter to reality.  In the real world, depreciation happens.  Assets get old and devalue.  So we have decreed by law that that depreciation is mitigated by tax writeoffs, again supporting asset valuations unnaturally.

So im a half canadian half norwegian student looking to apply to universities begining this fall. I have been uncertain what career path I would be taking further in life and have just recently decided that I would like to work with marketing of products and or psychology. 

Now both of these subjects are entwined but my reaserach has led me to believe that I am looking for a education within economics and then further specialization later. I am going to apply for universities in Austrailia, New Zealand and Canada and I am struggling to find the correct courses to enlist in. 


Should I be going for a BA/BS in basic economics then building on that into marketing or should I be going into a more specific course that doesnt necesserly give me a bachlor or masters. So far my only sure conclusion is that going into psychology will make it harder to get into the section of marketing I want to get into. I want to be dealing with mass psychology in markets.

As I understand it, the only reason a business would hire someone or create a position is because there is a need for that position. So if a company makes and sells 100 widgets a day, and has two employees who each can make about 50 widgets a day, they will not hire a 3rd employee unless is starts selling closer to 150 widgets a day, no matter how high profits go because it would be unnecessary. On the other side, they aren't going to get rid of that second widget maker because they need him to keep up with demand.

t3_1yjxin,"How Obamacare may well end up taking lots of money from the poor and sick (and taxpayers) to subsidize artificially lower rates for the wealthy healthy, while preventing the sick from getting the care they need and shaming them into not talking about it.","When a New York Senator with extensive ties to the financial industries proposed and the Democrats went along with the idea- of each risk pool being self supporting, I knew that Obamacare was almost certainly going to become a very bad deal for sick people. And indeed according to a recent analysis, it seems to have became one.

My theory is that Obamacare is designed in such a way that the poor sick will also paying for lower rates for the wealthy-healthy. 

Here is how the sick subsidizing the healthy will work.

Chronic illnesses aren't one time things. They result in high expenses year after year. So, many of the healthy will get cheaper premiums *because the sick will be so behind on their bills they won't be able to go to the doctor  or hospital until those past due bills are paid* - which they can't be because the amount will [exceed the poor's ability to pay](http://avalerehealth.net/news/analysis-despite-subsidies-chronically-ill-individuals-will-be-underinsured). Every year. 

Forcing millions of people who would otherwise be able to work out of the job market because they can't get treatment for their illnesses, whatever they are.

So, because they have a chronic illness - as the Avelere Health study says, [they will hit the out of pocket maximum every year, when they are using their coverage they will incur a lot of extra bills over the premiums](http://avalerehealth.net/news/analysis-despite-subsidies-chronically-ill-individuals-will-be-underinsured), $6000 for single people twice that for everybody else. So they soon will fall deeply into debt, and then they wont be able to get care. 

*But the subsidies will keep being paid in their names, so the insurance will continue, their past due bill will keep going up as they try to catch up*. 

IF it was just *their* money they would simply lose that *""coverage"".*

However, it isn't, its the taxpayer's money. So instead they (and the taxpayer) will be on the hook for the ever growing remainder of the premium bill even for months where they were unable to go to the doctor because they were $20,000 in the hole. 

**Since the insurer is basically getting free money, that will lower the prices for rich people who can afford to pay the co-pays and deductibles.**

At least that is what I see happening. The wealthy, often self-employed people are influential - and they are the ones Obamacare was written to help. They will get cheaper insurance because of all the poor people who can't use theirs, a subsidy which is largely at the taxpayer's expense.

As time has gone one, the amount of content available to consumers has increased dramatically, and people have only increased their overall entertainment spending despite the entertainment industries stating that piracy is ruining everything (that is an educated assumption, though). We are at the point where there is simply too much quality content to choose from. People don't pick money from trees; they have a finite income. Once they meet their maximum budget on entertainment, are they just supposed to ignore the other things they want to watch/listen to/play? 

I'm not directly supporting stealing copyrighted content, but I am saying that the big companies should be thankful that people even in these tougher times are still willing to keep their spending so high on entertainment. If they download music or movies illegally, they aren't actually hurting you, because they are already spending all they possibly can on everything else, including other entertainment. There isn't an actual loss of physical material when someone downloads an album. Hell, them consuming the illegally acquired content makes it more likely they will come back and buy more of the same later on, or tell their friends about it.

And off that, I think services like Spotify and Netflix are the future of entertainment. People have money, but they can't just spend all of it on entertainment. There is a lot they want, and they can get it through these services without spending past the budget. If the entertainment industry needs more money and it isn't getting it, then *maybe* its time to stop growing and producing so much content and realize that a balance must be met.

t3_20iteb,New tax system idea,"I've been thinking of this system for a while and wanted to know what fellow redditor thought of it.

This comes partly from the argument that corporate profits are taxed twice once at corporate level and again at the individual level. This was the justification for the capital gains being at a reduced rate. Which makes no sense to me, I could see taxing dividends differently if you believe that argument.

But here is my suggestion. We actually completely get rid of all corporate taxes. At the individual level we have a graduated level of taxes and virtually no deductions, also all money you gets counts toward this, company provides you free housing it has to be taxed.

I like this idea for a few reasons 
* corporations can concentrate on the business and profits and not worry about taxes distorting their thinking. 
* it would get some money out of politics since there would be no tax subsidies.
* less overhead for companies for their tax accountants! though they'd still have an army of accounts if they are publicly traded.

A few questions I have. How much would individual taxes have to go up to cover the lost revenue, hopefully with corporations paying less prices would go down to compensate. In theory if the tax revenues are the same people shouldn't have a large change in their purchasing power.

Would this make easy loopholes? Would companies divert all their earning to the USA and individuals be able to get all their income overseas?

I have decided the three ways it affects depositors and customers the most is through encouraging banks to make both unwise and perilous investment, causes the FDIC to enact regulation that benefit banks rather than the depositors in which it was initially intended to protect, and protects banks from natural economic forces that would do a better job of regulating them.

t3_226r4m,Wall Street upbeat after jobs data comes in below expectations,"Wall Street looks poised for all time highs today, after the monthly jobs data once again come in below expectations. 

http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/53214/wall-street-upbeat-after-jobs-data-53214.html

Why? Well, for a number of reasons.

First of all, **Wall Street LOVES a slack labor market**, because that means they can fire people who ask for a raise, or time off, or any other increase in benefits. You can't do that in a tight labor market. Secondly, it means that **they do not have to share their profits with their workers**. If the company increases sales by 10%, because the workers are producing more, that simply means the fat cats get fatter, and the workers get nothing! If you own stock in a company, this should make you downright giddy! (If you work for one of these companies this means you will be producing more , for the same or less pay....don't feel bad, however.. that's what we call ""productivity"".. so, you should be glad to know your ""productivity"" is rising! Yay for you!)

And finally, a weak job market in an election year means **the Federal Reserve will continue to print money and use it to buy US Treasury and mortgage bonds. This is done specifically to boost the stock market (also known as ""asset prices"").** The mechanism explaining how this works is complicated but in a nutshell, it can be explained like this: When the Fed prints money to buy Treasury Bonds, it buys those bonds from institutions like banks who currently own bonds. This has the effect of ""flushing"" cash in to the system. Banks typically put that cash to work in the stock market... secondly, it keeps interest rates low, making investments that pay interest less attractive...so, that causes money to flow to the stock market..

So, anyway.... in summary.. REJOICE America.. the economy still stinks, and that means new all time highs in the stock market should be right around the corner.

I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place to post this question; I tried the /r/cuba section first and I went nowhere so I hope to have better luck here.  If this question needs to be ask in some other section, please let me know.  So here's my question: 

The [CIA] (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2195.html#cu) claims that Cuba's GDP in 2012 was $72.3 billion,  ahead of the Dominican Republic's $59.27 billion.

Is that accurate?  My interest in the subject came after reading [this post] (http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/letter-cuba-embargo-or-not) by Michael Totten, who's been writing about this travels in Cuba.  I asked the question on the comments section of this article, but thought I'd have a better change to get an answer here.

As I posted in my comment on Mr. Totten article, the Dominican Republic is the largest tourist recipient in the Caribbean, it has a large manufacturing sector, it received $3 billion in foreign direct investment and receives about $1.5 billion in remittances from Dominicans living abroad.

Besides that it has a thriving mining sector, with just one gold mine managed by Canada's Barrrick Gold [exported $1.3 billion] (http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/23/us-gold-dominicanrepublic-idUSBRE9BM00220131223) last year.

I realize that I'm not giving much when it comes to numbers and I'm just going on what I know about the Dominican economy and what is reported about living conditions in Cuba (salaries capped at $20.00/month, scarcity of every day items), so I'm not even sure if this comparisons is correct.

I would appreciate if somebody could explain why the number reported by the CIA is accurate.  Where does the economic output comes from?  Does tourism and the limited reforms undertaken by Raul Castro explain this..?

Ulises

Let's assume wealth is largely virtual (not backed by hard assets such as gold, or even other commodities or services), and that currency is based on its perceived value alone.   

In this case, the value of a dollar is an abstraction.  Its worth as much as we want to believe its worth.  As long as people are willing to believe the dollar has value, they'll keep trading, spending and saving in dollars.

By extension, it shouldn't matter how in debt we are, because so long as people think there's a chance to pay it back (even if takes centuries) then they'll keep lending, investing, etc.  

Furthermore, if the U.S. Treasury or Federal Reserve (or whatever entity could do this) just agreed to give everyone in the country a set amount of money (say for example, $500,000) why not?

I'm a long term unemployed, two (going on three) degree college graduate.  I'll complete my degree in the healthcare industry in about a year.  I've had a lot of time on my hands.

What You NEED to Know about the Wealth Inequality Debate 

by Bill Bonner, Chairman, Bonner & Partners

 Bill Bonner Gualfin, Argentina 

Wednesday, 30 April 2014 

Dow up another 86 points. Can anything stop it? 

Yes. We're just waiting to find out what. 

We began this series with a question: Isn't it possible the same savants who now presume to address the problem of wealth inequality were those most responsible for causing it? 

The question arose as we discussed a publishing sensation: Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. As you will recall, the book – all 700 pages – was recently number one on the Amazon.com bestseller list. 

Whoever heard of an economics tome that sold so well? The reason, we suspect, is that the book tells us something that a lot of people were waiting to hear.

Who are the 30% Dividend Companies?

Why isn't anyone talking about THE most outrageous dividends in the public markets? Dividends so large and so safe you could, quite literally, live off of them. 

Click here for the full details.

Criminals, Chiselers and Con Artists

Piketty's gripe, as near as we can determine, is that the rich get richer – especially when economic growth rates are low. And that capitalism can lead to extreme wealth inequality. 

Economic growth rates have been trending downwards for the last 40 years or so. And the average annual wage, adjusted for inflation, has stagnated. But Piketty claims the average annual rate of return on capital (from profits, rents, dividends, interest, royalties, etc.) has remained robust. As a result, private capital has grown as a percentage of national income. And, the rich have gotten richer. Of course, there are many reasons for this – some innocent, others corrupt. 

We will not bother with the innocent ones. Criminals, chiselers and con artists are more revealing and entertaining. And just to make it more interesting, we will name names. In the 1970s – after President Nixon moved the world onto a purely fiat-based money system – the US economy was kissed by the magic of easy credit. 

Poof! 

It was transformed from a handsome prince... into a toad. It used to be an economy where people earned money by making things for people who could afford to buy them. It became an economy of people who lent money to people so they could buy things they didn't need with money they didn't have. 

Piketty thinks he is criticizing capitalism. But after the 1970s, real capital played a smaller and smaller role. It was replaced by credit and its sinister twin: debt. 

The r in Piketty's now famous annotation r > g (where r stands for the average annual rate of return on capital and g stands for the rate of economic growth) is supposed to represent the return on capital investment. 

But where did the wad come from? 

Savings rates went down. Real earnings went down. Growth rates went down. So how could there be more capital available and how could it produce higher rates of return (compared to economic growth)? 

Distortions and Delusions

The whole thing is a headache for a thoughtful man. Capital investments with no real capital behind them. Profits that outstrip the economic growth from which they must come. 

What to make of it? 

We don't dispute the basic fact: that the rich are getting richer. And that they are doing so by getting their hands on capital (something we believe is a damn good idea, especially for anyone hoping to build serious wealth). 

For years, we've been complaining about the distortions caused by central banks. Rewarding the asset-owning classes (the rich) is just one of them. You could add: creating market bubbles, depressing middle-class incomes, increasing debt levels, misallocating resources to worthless, wealth-destroying activities, allowing government to avoid serious budget control, financing monster houses coast to coast... and our own personal favorite – putting dorky economists in positions of immense power and status. 

And now we even have dorky economists with No. 1 bestselling books. What next? 

Revolution! At least, that is what you might think if you listen to Piketty. He thinks r will continue to outpace g. And the natives will get restless. 

The ""market economy, if left to itself, contains powerful forces of convergence in the distribution of wealth,"" he explains. But ""it also contains powerful forces of divergence, which are potentially threatening to democratic societies and to the values of social justice on which they are based."" 

A State Based on Fraud

Once again, Piketty misunderstands the modern, democratic state. It is not based on real social justice. It is based on fraud. 

The masses are told they control the government. And although the masses busy themselves with reading the newspapers, arguing about Obamacare and voting, the elites profit from bailouts, zero-interest-rate policies, subsidies, tariffs, sweetheart loans – you name it. 

That is how the rich really got so rich... with the eager connivance of the authorities. 

And now Piketty concludes that the forces of ""divergence"" (of wealth) are likely to be much more powerful in the 21st century and that someone needs to do something about it. 

Who? The same authorities who distracted the public while the elites picked their pockets! 

Until 1968, the Fed was required to maintain 25 cents worth of gold for every dollar in circulation. Then in 1968, under President Johnson, that requirement was scrapped. Thenceforth, there was no limit to the amount of cash and credit in the system. 

In 1971, under President Nixon, the US reneged on its commitment to pay off foreign-held debt in gold. Now, there was no limit to the amount of debt Americans could run up abroad. Instead of paying their bills in gold, they could just pay in dollars, which are essentially more debt instruments (although with zero maturity). 

In 1987... and again in 2000... Alan Greenspan showed that the Fed would not permit a serious correction. When a credit contraction threatened, the Fed came up with more credit on easier terms. 

By 2007, under the leadership of Ben Bernanke, the Fed was fully committed to credit expansion forever. Milton Friedman had convinced Bernanke that the Great Depression was caused by a shrinking supply of money and credit. Bernanke saluted Friedman with: ""We won't do it again."" Thanks to these numbskulls – and many others – real capital disappeared from the capitalist system. It was replaced by what Sisson called ""a fictitious money"" causing a ""monstrous aberration."" 

That is what we live with today. It was caused by the feds. They will continue making it worse... until the whole dreadful system blows up. 

Regards,



Bill

Market Insight:
Were the Last 100 Years a ""Once Off""? 

From the desk of Chris Hunter, Editor-in-Chief, Bonner & Partners

Piketty's book has, you might say, ""hit a nerve."" Especially his call for a global tax on capital.

An insight that has been garnering less attention: The last 100 years of economic history may have been a ""once off."" 

Piketty argues that a succession of unique events – the Bolshevik Revolution, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II and the Cold War – destroyed a lot of capital in the 20th century. And that the post-World War II baby boom and the entry of women into the workforce (growth in the working population) plus big increases in productivity did a lot to boost real economic growth. 

As a result, there weren't high levels of inequality between 1945 and the 1970s, when real economic growth started to fall again... and the Fed took over the task of creating ""demand"" by encouraging the Americans to take on more credit. 

The White House, Congress, the Fed – and most investors – have a hard time coming to grips with this tectonic shift. Whisper it, but economic growth rates of 10%... 5%... even 3% may not be ""normal."" 

Take a look at the chart below. It shows the real (inflation-adjusted) annual GDP growth rate in the US going back to 1935. 

http://imgur.com/Tys4Qu9

Source: multpl.com

As you can see, America's real annual GDP growth has been slowly, but surely, ""tapering off"" from highs of 8+% in the 1960s to the sub-3% rate today. 

The average real economic growth rate over the period was 4.4%. The US economy is currently growing at 43% below that level. And that's with the tailwind of the Fed's QE and ZIRP. 

Looking out ahead, you can forget the tailwinds of big growth in the labor force. And productivity growth over the last five years has been 42% lower than it was in the 1945-1973 period. 

Barring a big surge in productivity, something closer to 1% real annual US GDP growth over the next 20 years or so wouldn't be at all surprising. 

Food for thought for those ""too afraid"" to invest in steeply discounted stocks outside the US...

The media and blog posting blitz is also trying to say that only Republicans oppose it, which also probably isn't true. I think the endless statements to that effect are in fact what's known as ""overcompensating"". 

**I would expect Republicans to like Obama's ACA more than Democrats.**

After all 

 - it keeps low wages low 

 - and it extracts the most amount of money imaginable from the poor 

 - in exchange for really low quality health care. 

 - It also gives employers a way to lay off older workers without legal risk exposure.


That sounds more like a GOP healthcare plan, not a Democratic one, doesn't it?

And indeed, Obama got a huge amount of help from Republican voters who crossed over to vote for Obama, temporarily registering Democratic,  during the Democratic primaries in 2008.

t3_24xyf8,Help me to understand Quantitative Easing...,"It is my understanding that when the UK government has a budget deficit, they raise funds by borrowing from the Bank of England, who creates money and then lends it to the treasury with interest.

It is also my understanding that the BoE is wholly owned by the treasury as of 1946.

This raises the question, 'why does the BoE need to charge interest to itself'? And also, why does a nationalised institution need to make a profit?

If the BoE is required to make a profit, then who is profiting? If the treasury is profiting, then why bother charging the treasury interest to begin with?

The 2014 budget says £53 billion to be spent on interest payments for the year. Is this for money borrowed from the BoE?

I have found, over the past year or so, several great links and conversations in this sub, that have kept me engaged for a long time.

But, seriously, guys, what the fuck is going on?

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/) has comments so bad that they make me question my own sanity. I don't want to draw the inevitable r/politics comparison, especially since a lot of these comments aren't so much politicized as just plain stupid. From pot shot ad hominems to a clear misunderstanding of economics, finance, or general investing practices, it's a shitshow.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdghmp) we're told hedge funds aren't as useful as Wal-Mart because, I guess, Wal-Mart sells physical stuff. So, yeah, I guess Reddit (and Microsoft and Linux and fucking Adobe) are worthless because they don't sell physical stuff.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdlajd) we're urged to wonder whether the Federal Reserve has directly bailed out hedge funds. No evidence, just baiting. And for proof, the poster links to a Salon article about NAFTA.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdgb53) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdkz0v) we're told how Krugman is a hypocrite for criticizing rich hedge fund managers because he makes $250k per year. ZOMG SO MUCH MONEY! Of course that's about 200x smaller than the sums Krugman is talking about (and his income is irrelevant, since he's pro-capitalist in any case), but he obviously makes more than these basement dwellers, so time to be snarky, amirite?

For an added bonus, that second quote suggests that hedge fund managers deserve their money because at least they're being paid voluntarily, whereas teachers are being paid involuntarily through taxes. Beyond the mind-numbing stupidity of this is the irrelevance when discussing Krugman, who has worked at a private institution for years.

Then we've got [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdgc01) insisting that monetary expansion is a de facto benefit to all hedge funds, which of course ignores the fact that hedge funds often bet against one another, some are hurt by monetary policy expansion, and others have directly lost millions betting that QE would impact the economy one way when it caused the opposite to happen.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdi23l) is some more snark that contributes nothing. [And some more](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdfy73).

t3_26814r,"""I am trying to keep at the realities with you. Approximately total automation is coming. Men will be essential to the industrial equation but not as workers. People are going to be utterly essential as consumers‹what I call regenerative consumers, however, not just swill pails.""","> Automation is with us. There is no question about it. Automation was inevitable to intellect. Intellect was found to diferentiate out experience continually and to articulate and develop new tools to do physically repeated tasks. Man is now no longer essential as a worker in the fabulously complex industrial equation. Marx’s worker is soon to become utterly obsolete. Automation is coming in Russia just as it is here. The word worker describing man as a muscle-and-reflex machine will not have its current 1961 meaning a decade hence. Therefore, if man is no longer essential as a worker we ask: ""How can he live? How does he acquire the money or credits with which to purchase what he needs or what he wants that is available beyond immediate needs?"" At the present time we are making all kinds of economic pretenses at covering up this overwhelming automation problem because we don’t realize adequately the larger significance of the truly fundamental change that is taking place in respect to man-in-universe. As automation advanced man began to create secondary or nonproductive jobs to make himself look busy so that he could rationalize a necessity for himself by virtue of which he could ""earn"" his living. Take all of our bankers, for example. They are all fixtures; these men don’t have anything to do that a counting machine couldn’t do; a punch button box would suffice. They have no basic banking authority whatsoever today. They do not loan you their own wealth. They loan you your own wealth. But man has a sense of vanity and has to invent these things that make him look important.

> ....

> The vast industrial complex undertakings and associated capital investments are today so enormous and take so long to inaugurate that they require concomitantly rapid regenerative economics to support them. The enterprise must pay off very rapidly in order to be able to refund itself and obtain the economic advantage to inaugurate solution of the next task with still higher technical advantage. In that regenerative cycle of events, the more consumers there are the more the costs are divided and the lower the individual prices. The higher the frequency of the consuming the more quickly the capital cost can be refunded, and the sooner the system is ready for the next wave of better technology. So man is essential to the industrial equation as a consumer‹as a regenerative consumer, a critical consumer, a man who tasting wants to taste better and who viewing realizes what he views can be accomplished more efficiently and more interestingly. The consumer thus becomes a highly critical regenerative function, requiring an educational system that fosters the consumer’s regenerative capacity and capability.

> ....

> Every time we educate a man, we as educators have a regenerative experience, and we ought to learn from that experience how to do it much better the next time. The more educated our population the more effective it becomes as an integral of regenerative consumer individuals. We are going to have to invest in our whole population to accelerate its consumer regeneration. We are going to be completely unemployed as muscle-working machines. We as economic society are going to have to pay our whole population to go to school and pay it to stay at school. That is, we are going to have to put our whole population into the educational process and get everybody realistically literate in many directions. Quite clearly, the new political word is going to be investment. It is not going to be dole, or socialism, or the idea of people hanging around in bread lines. The new popular regenerative investment idea is actually that of making people more familiar with the patterns of the universe, that is, with what man has learned about universe to date, and that of getting everybody inter-communicative at ever higher levels of literacy. People are then going to stay in the education process. They are going to populate ever increasing numbers of research laboratories and universities.

> As we now disemploy men as muscle and reflex machines, the one area where employment is gaining abnormally fast is the research and development area. Research and development are a part of the educational process itself. We are going to have to invest in our people and make available to them participation in the great educational process of research and development in order to learn more. When we learn more, we are able to do more with our given opportunities. We can rate federally paid-for education as a high return, mutual benefit investment. When we plant a seed and give it the opportunity to grow its fruits pay us back many fold. Man is going to ""improve"" rapidly in the same way by new federally underwritten educational ""seeding"" by new tools and processes.

> Our educational processes are in fact the upcoming major world industry. This is it; this is the essence of today’s educational facilities meeting. You are caught in that new educational upward draughting process. The cost of education will be funded regeneratively right out of earnings of the technology, the industrial equation, because we can only afford to reinvest continually in humanity’s ability to go back and turn out a better job. As a result of the new educational processes our consuming costs will be progressively lower as we also gain ever higher performance per units of invested resources, which means that our wealth actually will be increasing at all times rather than ""exhausted by spending."" It is the ""capability"" wealth that really counts. It is very good that there is an international competitive system now operating, otherwise men would tend to stagnate, particularly in large group undertakings. They would otherwise be afraid to venture in this great intellectual integrity regeneration.

> I would say, then? that you are faced with a future in which education is going to be number one amongst the great world industries, within which will flourish an educational machine technology that will provide tools such as the individually selected and articulated two-way TV and an intercontinentally net-worked, documentaries call-up system, operative over any home two-way TV set.

t3_280yjs,"As we convert to a more regionalized and sustainable economy, how independent can the various countries/regions of the world become, economically? What could and couldn't we all start making for ourselves?","So, I hope my question is clear from the title. But I'll try to elaborate a little more:

Due to peak oil, the whole world will soon have to start using far less oil, which means shipping both intra- and internationally will have to decline in a major way for every country, though not at the same pace for every country. At any rate, soon every country will be forced to use far less oil in its economy. Somehow or another, some catastrophe or shortage or shock is going to help humanity figure this out--that the economy depended on cheap oil and the oil just isn't flowing up as much as it used to but we're on track to need even more if we're gonna give the babies that are being born the sort of lives we've been living, on a material and consumer basis. That we're not ""almost out of it"" but we're moving swiftly and steadily in that direction. Plus we're using up all sorts of other really bad stuff to use up, like arable land, and water in aquifers, fish populations, and we're peaking in many other resources (like phosphorous) that are critical in our economy. And if that weren't enough, if we don't stop producing so much carbon dioxide, that's going to kill us, too. So for many reasons, we're all going to have to start using a lot less of all sorts of resources--and then less and less and less until somehow we're a completely sustainable economy. I like to think we can try to make it work and keep civilization from falling apart. Anyway.

Specialization will have to come down and regional/local manufacture of almost everything is going to have to come up. Right? 

But anyway, some things we'll still have to ship from afar, and we can conserve our fuel for these things. I hear there are some metals and minerals that are chiefly produced only in a few places, so I feel like that stuff would still have to be shipped and traded if all the regions were to maintain some kind of high-tech industry.

So, even Cuba consumes a pretty large amount of oil. They're gonna feel a pinch in that regard from peak oil too, won't they?

Anyway, I don't know how clear that is, but that's the general sort of thing I'm interested in. I don't really know much about which statistics I would look at and where I would look them up to try to figure the answer to this question out on a concrete material basis--and you know I mean how much of everything--in terms of like, bikes, computers, airplanes, internet infrastructure, agriculture equipment and inputs, monitors, fire alarms, wind turbines and other products and materials important in building sustainable electricity generation and delivery systems, etc. etc. What goods are we just not all going to be able to make? What goods will disappear because we just can't make them anymore?

How does that work in a modern economy?,"In many civil wars and revolutions, wealth is redistributed from those in power to those that seize the power. The seizure of land and gold and other property by the common people, for instance. In a modern class war, how would the common people seize the assets of the wealthy, when those assets are nothing more than 0s in a digital banking system?

Is it even possible to revolt against the bourgeoisie anymore?

How would a modern revolutionary affect the truly wealthy when those assets may be tied to stocks, investments, and other instruments that are foreign?

The seizure of physical property would be a very small portion of the virtual wealth available. 

I'm really curious about this. I'm convinced that violent revolution in a modern economy would not only be pointless, it would be detrimental to the citizens because the physical wealth (gold, silver, land and livestock) that was once available for seizure and redistribution, is now nothing more than digital goods.

t3_29lky2,I believe USA markets are about to crash. Your views on the same would be appreciated.,"I base my claims on multiple indices but for simplicity would list 3 of them(which are readily available) here. The Markets have reached pretty high and seems to have created an euphoria, but if analysed carefully the present valuations are unrealistic and it seems there would be a correction for sure. 

Lets look at few indicators:

1) Buffet Ratio: Market cap to GDP ratio. The basis for using this ratio is to see that companies are not valued more than the GDP itself. The valuation of all companies in an economy should not exceed the total GDP of the economy thus a market cap to GDP ratio of more than 1 would signal a red flag.

[Here is the link for Buffet ratio](http://www.vectorgrader.com/indicators/market-cap-gdp)

Take a look at the points when it went beyond 1. Both of those periods were bubbles (2000 and 2008). So the present ratio of 1.27 is clearly in the red region.

2) The Shiller PE ratio for S&P 500 (CAPE)(P/E 10): It is a valuation measure, generally applied to broad equity indices (in this case S&P 500), that uses real per-share earnings over a 10-year period. It uses smoothed real earnings to eliminate the fluctuations in net income caused by variations in profit margins over a typical business cycle.
Looking at the last twenty years the only 2 peaks above the present CAPE ratios are both bubbles. Again an indicator that present valuations are unrealistic.

[Here is the link for Shiller PE ratio](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/)

3) NYSE margin debt: Margin debt levels, and their rate of change, are sometimes used as an indicator of investor sentiment because margin debt rises when investors feel good about the prospects in the stock markets. In the past, margin debt levels have peaked at the same time market indexes reached relative peaks. When markets decline in a hurry, a large number of margin calls will usually come due, which can add to already heightened selling pressure.

[Here is an article on NYSE margin debt](http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/NYSE-Margin-Debt-and-the-SPX.php)

Lets discuss the above points first. Would be adding the other indicators later on if people are really interested in the discussion.

t3_2ay87j,Keynes and Lenin on QE and the Wealth Gap,"""Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become 'profiteers,' who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery. Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose"" 

-- John Maynard Keynes

These words ring true today as the Wealth Gap continues to expand as a consequence of the Fed's expansionary monetary policies (ZIRP, QE) juicing asset markets to all time highs, causing the rich to get richer, while poor and middle class people are struggling to keep up with rising standard of living costs.

t3_2b50sh,Economic theory of food stamp programs,"I've always been frustrated that there is no public information on how food stamp dollars are spent. Food stamps are somewhat unique, especially these days with EBT cards. With welfare programs, you get a check and have discretion over what you want to purchase. With Food Stamps (now SNAP), you get a card pre-loaded with money that can only be used to purchase foods from an approved retail store selling food. 

**What interests me is this: how do you think SNAP money is spent??** There are anecdotes of people on SNAP spending that money on chips, cookies, and soft drinks, but there is so much food available and no one knows what percentage of money is spent on what. Economic theory would support the argument that we make different decisions based on our situation, but when we get bonuses (or additional tax rebates), most people don't go out and spend those right away. With the Bush tax break, spending was not spurned and was a great example of how people took the unexpected money and put it to use in bettering their financial situation (paying down debts, investing it, etc.), not on buying a new TV.

EBT benefits are different - we all need food, and you can get by on almost anything. Your healthiness will be different if you are eating cookies and chips everyday instead of vegetables and chicken, but you can still live. These benefits also aren't unexpected - they come in monthly.

**Would consumers on these programs be theoretically inclined to spend their benefits in ways that are more immediately gratifying? People will act in more risky ways with money that isn't theirs, so is it fair to say that consumer on these programs will spend money in more personally satisfying ways when using money given to them by the government?** 

*I personally believe that people on these programs spend money differently and are not well educated in nutrition, so this spending can lead to adverse health affects that, for those on medicare and SNAP, would mean the public is paying the costs of food and health care, and the person is paying the cost of having poor health. It seems requiring nutrition education, or a food benefits program that provides set food items instead of consumer discretion, would be more publicly beneficial and better for the individual on SNAP.*",8,0.9,1405785906.0

**Summary of Real-World Needs versus Theoretical Constructs of Academia**


While the 1990s saw the push to reduce official inflation reporting, by shifting from a fixed-weight to at least a quasi-substitution-based CPI, less-publicized actions were taken to reduce CPI reporting through the introduction of hedonic quality adjustments, starting in the 1980s


**Maintaining Constant Standard of Living (Fixed-Basket Inflation) versus Substitution in CPI**


-Since the 1700s, consumer inflation has been estimated by measuring price changes in a fixed-weight basket of goods, effectively measuring the cost of living of maintaining a constant standard of living.


-Allowing substitution of lower-priced and lower-quality goods in the basket (i.e. more hamburger when steak prices rise) lowers the reported rate of inflation versus the fixed-basket measure.


**-BLS introduced: Geometric weighting—**a purely a mathematical gimmick that automatically reduces the weightings of goods rising in price, and vice versa—it has no demonstrated relationship to consumer substitution of goods based on price changes. It was explained as a surrogate for a substitution measure.


-BLS introduced: More frequent re-weightings of the CPI index from every ten years to every two years, which moved the CPI closer to a substitution-based index, but the change was not considered a change in methodology.


-BLS introduced: Ongoing re-weightings of sales outlets (discount/mass-merchandisers v ersus Main Street shops), also moving closer to a substitution-based index and creating other constant-standard-of-living issues.


**Out-of-Pocket Expenses versus Nebulous Quality (Hedonic) Adjustments**


The BLS expanded quality adjustments to include the concept of “hedonic” quality adjustments, altering the pricing of goods and services for nebulous quality changes that often were not viewed or recognized by consumers as desired improvements.


Where the effect here on the pricing of goods and services could not be quantified directly from a pricing standpoint, the pricing impact was estimated by computer statistical modeling—hedonic adjustment modeling—that had little if any relevance to real-world experience.


Where the quality of the product was deemed by the government to have improved (the usual circumstance), prices in the CPI calculations were adjusted lower to offset the higher quality.


-Usually, though, the purchasing consumer only had the option of paying out-of-pocket the full price for the product, again with little or no concept of the quality improvement being acquired and/or having no chance to opt out of paying for the improvements.

**Examples**

In an early example, the government mandated the use of a gasoline formulation that purportedly would improve auto emissions. That added ten cents per gallon to gasoline costs, but that cost was excluded from CPI calculations. The person filling his or her gas tank, however, suffered the actual out-of-pocket expense. The government later abandoned excluding government-mandated “quality” improvements, such as gasoline additives, from inflation calculations, but the principles here were exactly the same for industry-generated “quality” improvements that were not optional to consumers.


Text books, for example were modeled, where one pricing factor in the hedonic quality model was whether or not there were color pictures in a book. Unless the student was an art student, the concern usually was not over colored pictures, but rather along the lines of “What is my out-of-pocket cost for textbooks this semester? New computer features usually were deemed quality improvements, with downside price adjustments made in the CPI for the changes, even though a consumer may not have wanted or used the features.


*The consumer still had to buy those features and pay full cost out-of-pocket, irrespective of what the government determined those products were generating in purported hedonic quality benefits that the consumer was not considering or using.*


Significant feature changes should be treated as a new product introduction, or otherwise ignored. If the use of the hedonic process were legitimate here, it would be applied to all goods and services, but a CPI, so based, soon would become meaningless to the public (as already has happened with the CPI-U).


*For example, there has been no pricing adjustment (upside in this case) to the costs of air travel for the destruction of travel convenience with the advent of the TSA, or from the downward spiral in U.S. air traveler comfort and convenience resulting from the effects of mergers and acquisitions, and from increasing flight delays due to economizing on aircraft maintenance.*


*Consumer concerns are for his or her out-of-pocket expenses. What am I paying for my textbooks this semester; what am I paying out-of-pocket to fly from New York to Chicago; or what am I paying out-of-pocket for a computer, even if I am looking just to use limited functions but have no choice but to buy unwanted features?*

Also, I think that the US system may be shooting itself in the foot with this (I do understand, of course, that the US system is not a unified voice and the decisions made by the judicial system say little to nothing about the current administration's position on the issue, I clarify this because as I'm not a US national I may well now know this).

A summary of the situation from Wiki before I go further, you can check sources there.

Holdouts retained a total of USD4 billion in bonds as of 2013.[10] Vulture funds, which owned USD1.3 billion of this total,[5] sued to be repaid at 100% of face value for bonds purchased not from Argentina but on the secondary market for cents on the dollar after the 2002 default,[11] filing injunctions to attach future payments to other bondholders by way of forcing Argentina to settle.[2][12][13][14][15] Vulture funds, moreover, own a large quantity of credit default swaps (CDS) against Argentine bonds, creating a further incentive to not only trigger a default against Argentina; but also to undermine the value of the bonds themselves, as the CDS would pay out at a higher rate if the defaulted bonds decline to extremely low values.[11] Meeting vulture funds' full face-value demands is problematic for Argentina, because although bonds held by vulture funds are a small share of the total (1.6%), such a settlement would lead to lawsuits from other bondholders demanding to be paid on similar terms and thereby create a liability of USD15 to USD20 billion.[16]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring

***

Why I side with my country:

- We have maintained, to enormous strain to our economy, debt obligations. We have, as a society, diverted an enormous amount of resources to actually pay up our debts to the best of our possibilities.

- We have done this in reasonable terms under all possible common sense conceptions: we have paid the IMF and have agreed with the enormous majority of our debt-holders.

- The litigious group is an openly speculative fund that is not the original debtholder. I understand this is legitimate under the law, of course, but this is clearly an exploit that needs to be addressed in my opinion.

Why I think this is important:

- Argentines are not pioneers of many things, but we are pioneers of debt crises. We've been having them since the middle of the 20th century, and the 2001 one was basically a ""petri-dish"" case of much of what came afterwards. 

- This sets the tone not only for further litigations against emerging countries, which would be very very dangerous to the world because I think that at this point emerging economies are a big driver of world economy, correct me if I'm wrong, but also for the future of the national debt market. Will emerging countries look to place debt under US Law with this precedent? I wouldn't think so, and this could be the start of a shift in a market that, in my opinion, has been a big part of US economy for some time now.

I can totally see how my views could be biased not only because of me being from Argentina but also because of some ignorance on my part as I'm not an expert by any means. So I come here with my strong opinions looking to have them shot down.

Once it has 200 committers* then it can start a beta stack exchange forum. 

The address is http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/61732/economics if you want to sign up.

For those who haven't used Stack Exchange before, it's a Q&A site. It has a similar structure to Reddit, but is strictly for Q&A rather than general discussion/link sharing. It's more tightly moderated, and IMO has better gamification dynamics (eg earning editing privileges with reputation). 

Check out the definition questions in the proposal to see what you can expect from the beta. 

At this stage it's commitment, which means you sign up with an email address, and they'll email you when it gets started. That will be in a couple of months of so, at the least.

There are items that randomly drop after matches called ""chests"" which can be opened with a key that costs $2.50 in the store. These chests contain an item out of the series for that chest and a chance for a super rare item. Many (most) players use keys as a currency because they have a very stable value and directly translate to real world money, and they are **only** obtainable by purchasing them. Keys are pretty much the only item in the game like this.

With the most recent update to the game, Valve has announced that they will remove keys from the game by July 1st 2015, and chests are now purchased in the store for the same priced and do not require a key to open them. Until they are removed, all keys can be used to redeem a free chest of your choice. 

I know almost nothing about economics and I am very curious as to how this will affect the price of keys (I have a ton) in the upcoming months. My options are to sell now, sell later, or use them (like any form of gambling, the average value of the reward is less than the cost of getting one so I never use keys to open chests but I may do so now).

t3_2gm4rp,Price discrimination and economic efficiency,"I'm interested if anyone is familiar with consensus opinion on economic efficiency of [price discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination).  I've run across several articles that state that price discrimination is economically-efficient.  That seems plausible to me.

There would need to be restrictions to prevent suppliers of goods from colluding in setting prices; that is, each would need to come up with its own prices to discriminate upon.  Having global price floors set across suppliers for a market would permit price discrimination being used to establish monopoly prices, as [happens](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20019/1/sp04ke05.pdf) with California raisin prices.  However, I can envision a world where price discrimination is performed on a per-supplier basis.

College financial aid is currently the area that I can think of where price discrimination is most-widely used.  Here, a college sets its price as a maximum of what it might charge, then selectively provides discounts from that price, such that each individual person paying as much as they can bear, and letting the supplier get access to information about the consumer's assets.  I'm not sure whether this mechanism works well or not, but within this field, certainly price discrimination is very common.

However, if price discrimination *is* economically-efficient, why do policies not seem to globally-encourage it?  If it is not economically-efficient, why do policies not seem to globally-discourage it?

The dispute over [imported prescription drugs](http://www.forbes.com/sites/edsilverman/2013/12/31/will-americans-be-allowed-to-import-prescription-drugs/) seems to show a shift towards banning price discrimination in that field.  [Region-coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_region_code), a technique to permit price discrimination, is [not protected by the DMCA or by the EU equivalents](http://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/2003/10/60996).

On the other hand, [many countries have parallel import legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_import), which specifically-enables price discrimination.  Not all countries do this, however.

t3_2grigh,Question on the QE!,"Sorry this is probably too long but it has been bugging me for a while and I’ve not managed to wrap my head around it yet. I’m a very rusty economics grad, so please be gentle and ELI5…

A bit of background: I studied economics at uni and am now working for a wealth management firm as a trainee investment manager. I’m based in the UK and so have been studying towards qualifications that will let me manage investment portfolios on a discretionary basis. During these studies they repeatedly use the quantity theory of money equation (MV = PT) as a point of reference for economic policy. 

My understanding of the quantity theory of money equation is that part of it relies on the assumption that money is an exogenous factor to aggregate demand and therefore can be used as a tool to manipulate demand and control inflation etc. In other words, quantitative easing policies are designed to increase the money supply, reduce interest rates and cause inflation through increased demand.  

In my final year at uni we learnt the Neo-Keynesian 3 equation model (IS-PC-MR) where they pretty much told us everything we’d learnt in the first two years was bullshit and that the money supply and demand for money is endogenous and actually a product of aggregate demand. Hence the interest rate is the way you control demand and not through the quantity of money. 

As you can probably tell by my mixing of theories and general confusion, I didn’t do very well in these lectures, which is probably why I find myself at this point. 

If my understanding of the IS-PC-MR is correct, QE does work to create low interest rates but cannot create inflation. This seems to be reflected in the UK data where banks sit on massive quantities of cash because no one wants to take out a loan and the inflation figures are, let’s say, sub optimal. 

Why then do we continue to use it as a stimulus? There are rumours of European QE where interest rates are already ridiculous and the money is going to do nothing else but sit in banks across Europe? What am I missing?

TL;DR What’s the point of QE? 

Edit: I may have gotten there with a bit of prompting. Rewind to 2008 and the world is in melt down. No one knows what to do or has time to debate the virtues of Keynesian vs classical economics, so just do both. Lower interest rates & increase money supply. Boom, both ends covered.

Any advance on that?",5,0.74,1411050645.0
t3_2gz08p,Why does Cameroon export AND import crude/refined petroleum.,"Hi,
I am currently writing a country paper on Cameroons economy and came across the following: 
Cameroons top export good is petroleum, making up 50% of Cameroons total exports. But at the same time Cameroons also imports petroleum (25,7% of total imports), which seems kind of strange to me since Cameroon does produce petroleum itself. Under what circumstances is it better to import goods even though I can produce them myself? My only guess is that cameroons production costs are much higher than elsewhere. But then again, this doesn't make sense since Cameroon is pretty much focused on petroleum. ^^

Looking further most of Cameroons refined petroleum gets exported to neighbouring african countries like Nigeria or the D.R. of Congo,which makes sense since they probably do not have the means to refine petroleum. 
Crude petroleum on the other hand gets mainly shipped to Europe, China and India. -->also makes sense

Very high levels of debt/gdp are possible, as long as tax revenue can keep up with interest payments (which is easy, as interest rates are currently very small in the US).

The popular measure of public sector debt is debt/gdp, which we've established is bad. My question to you, Economists of reddit, is whether or not Tax Revenue - Interest Expense month over month is a better measure for public sector debt burden.

If interest rates are high, public sector debt is large, and tax revenue has shrunk (recession conditions), then you have a right to be concerned about a country's debt burden. Right?

t3_2ix6m1,"My treatise on money, debt, government and wealth from 5000 years ago to the present (Final part)","You must remember that money is an output of what we do and how we think, it's just the end, external result of our activities. So when people talk about giving people money or bailing out the people, that simply doesn't make sense. If nothing else in the economy changes, just giving the people (private sector) money won't change anything. The money is the output, just the result. You can't feed that into the private (producing) sector. 


So finally, you can get a better understanding of what has happened since 2008. The QE for the most part just refilled lost liquidity. There was virtually no inflation because they didn't add too much to the total amount that the private sector was using. That's what central banks around the world have been doing. Refilling liquidity that was lost when mortgages went bad. But if velocity of money isn't picking up, that's another issue entirely. That's got to do with the behaviour of the people. Not with the money itself. What's the trickle-down effect the Fed is talking about? It's giving money to the financial sector and then hoping they spend it into the economy. The value of the money is in the decisions people make with it,  and so forcing people to spend the money will lessen its value. So all the Fed or any central bank can do is give out money and then hope people spend it wisely (whatever that means in a given region or nation). The problem now is that we seem to have this overwhelming optimism in what central banks can do. If there's a structural problem, money will do nothing in that situation. If the King gives his soldiers coins, but only a small portion of them spend them, then the problem is not the coins. It won't matter what the King gives his soldiers as payment or what promises he makes. He has to use non-monetary means to get the other soldiers to spend their money. So he has to make structural changes. There could be dissatisfaction amongst the soldiers. There could be a problem with production amongst the producing sector. Either way, the fact that the money isn't being spent is just a symptom of something else going on. So in that case, adding more money to the economy won't change anything. 


**A few things to consider:**

A Government can never run out of money that is has sovereign control over

It can always print the money it needs

It does not need a source of revenue

Taxes are not a source of revenue for the government

Tax is a political decision


--But


Why do tax collection agencies go to extreme lengths to collect taxes?

Money has value (or at least part of it) because people pay taxes

The work the private sector does gives value to money


--Also


Production drives growth

Without production, there is nothing to buy


--But


Consumer spending accounts for 70% of GDP

This is how we trade and interact with one another


**Final points**

There is nothing inherent in any object we have ever used as money. It's all psychological. Even gold and silver have no inherent qualities. They contain some qualities, and it's our psychological makeup and how we've progressed as a species that sees value in those qualities. Outside of the way we are as people, gold and silver do not matter. Money just has to be an external representation of what's going in our heads. We humans have a propensity to lie, cheat, deceive or simply not tell the truth. It's very hard to tell if someone is being genuine. Yet in this world, we must deal with one another. So money provides external proof of at least some aspect of our dealings with one other.  

**Money has 3 roles**

-External Representation of what's going on in our heads
-Allows us to live with strangers and be anonymous in large cities
-Allows us to get rich (with the help of a governing power)

t3_2ix6g2,"My treatise on money, debt, government and wealth from 5000 years ago to the present (part 2)","**The Government, money and price**

The private sector produces goods and services that it uses amongst itself. Money that is used exclusively by the private sector would net out to 0, as one person would spend, another would save. You could have a rich person for a while, but he would have most of the money in the society and eventually would need to spend on what he needs anyway. But all transactions net out to 0. But using technology, the private sector produces a surplus. Where should that surplus go? The Government now steps in. The Government consumes some of that surplus. All it has done is give out money, it's not really 'spending' as it never had resources in the first place. It's just giving the private sector money for use of some of that surplus. But there is surplus leftover after the government has taken its share. And this is what the private sector and Government now competes for. And this final surplus, is what enables people to get sustainably wealthy. So the Government has given out money to the private sector for the initial surplus that was created. It (or more accurately, the Central Bank) now has to 'price' the final surplus. You have to ensure the private sector has enough money to buy the surplus, otherwise the Government can have money printed and simply buy the final surplus. It would outbid the private sector in this scenario. This would be tantamount to confiscation, since it's not allowing the people who produce to have access to the surplus. It also removes incentives for people to work harder to get access to more money to then get a larger share of the surplus. The Government creates enough money to properly price the surplus goods and services so that you don't have deflation or too much inflation. And this is where you have to be careful that the rich don't consume too much of the surplus pie from the poor. And you want these prices to be relatively stable, so that people can make projections, people can start businesses and so on. Now this is simplified of course, but it's a broad overview of what happens.



**The army and religion**

Religions and the army were the first exterior, non-productive sectors that received money first and spent it into a society. Government takes that role now. It was just a way to organise the first societies. An exaggerated example given in Debt: The First 5000 years is as follows: A King has a large army that he wants to maintain. But supplying it is difficult, expensive and time consuming. Not to mention the logistics. So what he does is hands out a bunch of coins to his soldiers, demands some of them back as taxes, and boom, you have an economy. The soldiers want to spend these coins they've been given, and people need to have them to pay tax. So the economy becomes organised as people want to provide goods and services to the soldiers, and from the outside, this would look like a 'natural market'. Why does the army get the money first in this instance? It provides an intangible service: safety in an uncertain world. Religion is very similar in this regard, as it provides salvation and reassurance in an uncertain world. 


**Government debt**

Is simply the surplus the private sector has to play with. The debt isn't something to be 'paid off'. Moreover, the government debt (a number) is not tied to resources; so that all this talk of future generations working off government debt is nonsense. It is not that way and it cannot be that way. It would be undesirable to 'pay off' the government's debt, as this would destroy a lot of money in the private sector. In this instance, the Government debt just has a PR problem.


**Wealth**

It's easy to think of wealth as simply a high number in someone's bank account. So for example, you might imagine that a wealthy person just has a really high number in their bank account. You might have 700 dollars, and then you think the rich person has 1 million dollars in their bank account. But that's simply not the case. A lot of their money is in bonds, stocks, other assets and so on. The wealth is just the accumulated value of these investments. But it's not just a high number in the bank account. What difference does it make? Not just in terms of higher interest rates, but that the rich have a vested interest in keeping the economy going, and a slight downturn in those investments can mean a large loss in wealth. And so the wealth is partly contingent on time. This is where discussion on the minimum wage comes in. People often use Wal-Mart as an example. For the last financial year, the profits were 128 billion. It's easy to look at that figure and say that a few hundred million could be garnished off the top and be paid to the workers in the form of a higher minimum wage. But think about this as a micro-economy. Adding more money into the system without any structural changes won't achieve too much. But besides, it's easy to say that the profit can be taken from a bank account that holds the profits of the company. But the heirs wouldn't just have the profits in a large bank account. They invest it. So when you ask for more money from them, it could mean the rich heirs need to pull money out of other investments to then pay their workers more. This is important. It's not a matter of just pulling out money from a bank account where the money is 'stagnating'. Those heirs are investing it, and they may need to sell stocks, bonds, assets and so on to pay these workers extra. Which will then have knock-on effects in the economy. So you're not really looking for a higher minimum wage as you are structural changes that will allow you to live better on the wage you're getting paid or some other changes. So think of wealth as a floating amoeba, that receives constant inputs to keep it afloat. Of course there are outputs, and so the amoeba just floats in a particular spot, given its inputs and outputs. Inputs could be stocks going up, bonds, assets going up in price (but not necessarily value), and other similar windfalls. The person has their own expenses, and this keeps the amoeba floating in a particular spot. The important thing is that wealth has constant inputs; it's not about working for a bit, getting a large amount of money, becoming wealthy, and then just having a 1,000,000 in the bank account and sitting back and relaxing. That's not wealth. Imagine how many people would do this. It could well be a disaster for the economy. This is why the wealthy work so hard. This is why we hear about wealthy people working really hard, and sometimes it's easy to think 'why doesn't that person just slow down?' But this about the effect our system has on people. It's a really good thing that you can't just work for a bit, and sit back and enjoy the money. We require people to keep working! Even the wealthiest amongst us.


**Financial system and the bailouts**

A lot of people were and still are upset about how the financial industry got bailed during the crisis. But this makes perfect sense. The financial sector is where religion and the military used to stand. Both were non-producing sectors, and both spent money into the economy and helped to create and perpetuate markets. So the King would give money to the religious leaders or to the Armies who would then spend the money into the economy, and that money is given value because people worked to get it. The money spent into the economy is given value by the work done by the private sector. So if there's a problem, does it make sense for the King to give the people money directly? Of course not. He gives it either to the military or the religious leaders, and they spend more money into the economy. If he gave the people money directly, and nothing else changed (prices and so on), the people might work less now since they can more easily pay their taxes and have more money left over. You have more money, why work as hard? But everyone would think the same thing, and eventually you get into a spiral, as fewer goods and services are available and so on.

t3_2ix5vv,"My treatise on money, debt, government and wealth from 5000 years ago to the present (Part 1)","Am I just paraphrasing a lot of the work from Debt: The First 5000 years? Why yes I am. But I am adding  important information and simplifying the narrative for anyone to understand because it's a dense book. Basically I want to help explain the behaviour of central banks around the world since the 2008 financial crisis. All the stimulus programs happening around the world basically. Finally, I want to help you understand wealth and the minimum wage.  



**In the beginning**

The basic method humans used to interact with one another before the widespread use of money was social credit. This is best understood when you're out with your  friends and you purchase something for one of them because they can't afford it right now. Do you set terms and conditions on the repayment like a bank does? Of course not, neither would you charge interest. In fact, you might not even care that much when it's paid back, since you're certain they will do at some point. Moreover, it may be the situation that you bought something for your friend for $10, but you don't expect them to pay you back exactly $10 or something else of the same value. You may accept that same friend just buying lunch or two small lunches and call the debt paid. If you can't imagine doing this with a person, then that person most likely is not your good friend. It really has to be someone you can trust.



And before the advent of coinage, which is as much a social revolution as a technological one, we lived in small villages and towns. In these circumstances, most people would have known each other, and trusted one another enough to use social credit/debt with one another. You might know the same 50 people your whole life, and this can be seen as basically an extended group of friends. You didn't need physical tokens in such an atmosphere, as everything was basically stored as a virtual 'ledger' that everyone held in their heads that was essentially a snapshot of the economy in that town/village. The economy existed in our heads. This by the way, is how we can think of Central Banks today; they are the virtual ledger for our entire economy, it's just an external representation (external to our minds) of our economy. Seeing it like this, we can see that the invention of Central Banks really isn't that revolutionary. What's important to note about this economy is that there are discrete transactions as all the interactions were simply in a flowing state, where you owed something to one person but someone could owe you something else. And the 'value' of items was particular to the people involved, their history, personality and so on. It was normal for people to be creditors and debtors to one another at the same time and there was no such thing as 'paying off your debts'. In fact, if you looked to 'pay off your debt' to someone, that would in fact mean you wanted nothing further to do with that person.



**Coinage**

This is now where bullion steps in. If you're dealing with strangers, you wouldn't use such a system since you can't vouch for the people you're dealing with. In these instances, you use coins or tokens, and those interactions with the strangers then  become a single transaction, that's settled in a single trading session. That made sense, you might never deal with those people again. But what happened as we started in live in larger settlements and where it was impossible to vouch for everyone was that we needed to use coins or tokens on a daily basis, not just with a passing stranger or similar situation. Without coins, it would have been almost impossible to live in such large centres as a cohesive group. This is where coins and the 'market' is born. With strangers we don't have time to establish a dynamic or any history with each other, and that's where now a combination of the law, bullion and 'markets' means we're all equals when it comes to transactions. Your $10 is the same as my $10, and so on. Now every interaction is a transaction and we use coins/tokens with one another. Throughout history, this just happened to be gold/silver. It's important to understand that the 'market' is not a natural state of human affairs. It's an institution we have placed over each other so that we can live in large numbers together. 


But of course given the level of technology we had (and diminishing returns), we only had so much food production and therefore the world population was relatively stable for a long time. In this situation, gold and silver are fine to use as money since population growth was quite stable or grew at a slow rate and so it was easy to provide all the gold/silver people needed to deal with one another. From Debt: The First 5000 Years, the author points out that in many occasions during the middle ages (before 1450 AD) there were shortages of coins and people simply reverted back to either using local currencies with limited circulation or just social credit/debt arrangements. This simply is not feasible anymore, we must have money to trade with one another.



**The government, surplus**

This is now where we encounter the Government. It is important in human affairs that a Government does not produce anything. It simply governs. This has two aspects to it: firstly, a policy-setter that also produced something could set policies that favoured himself; and we instinctively feel that a policy-setter who produced half the time would not be good at the former job. We recognise that we live better when we're together, but for that to work, we need a governing power in place. A governing power provides a high-level view of a region, one that it can do because the people in power are not producing anything. The governing power consumes the surplus of the private sector and in exchange, it provides security and services to society. By consuming a surplus that it did not produce, the Government gives out money, and this gives people the prospect of becoming wealthy. It also creates more extreme inequality. This is simply a by-product of having a governing power and money in play. 



**The 'market'**

There is a lot of talk about leaving the market alone, how much Government's should be involved and so on. This is a false dichotomy. There is no market without Government. It's simple as that. People always assume that the market is how people interact naturally. This is false. It's a manmade institution, that can only exist with the law, with enforcement and vigilance. 



**Bullion/Central Banks**

I think it's a false dichotomy to talk about Governments printing money and an economy relying on gold, which cannot be printed but must be dug up out of the ground. But of course it can be debased, as has happened many times during history. Bullion and central banks share one aspect in common: they are not controlled by the Government. The entire point of a central bank is that it is free from the Government, and so monetary policy is separate from politics. And it's worked. Bullion works in an environment where population is relatively stable, but with a growing population, you need someone to be in control of the money supply. You cannot have a shrinking money supply but also a growing population, as that would mean there are fewer tokens for strangers to exchange with each other. If strangers can't use money to interact with one another, they will use other means, and most are violent. It is a feature of post-apocalypse shows/games that money isn't in use, and everyone now is a stranger to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. But this is time consuming, so we often have shortcuts to deal with each other, and again, these are often violent. Right now, we may have such shortcuts in mind when dealing with a stranger, but we have money instead that we use to deal with that stranger.

t3_2ix0xc,Hypothetical Economic Model,"Hi,

I am a person who has taken financial math in high school, understands the difference between capitalism and communism and knows the very basics of economics (i.e. supply and demand). However, I am not an expert in this field so I would like to consult with people who know better than me about a fictional economic model that I am devising for a fantasy novel that I am writing.

In real life, costs are determined by how plentiful and readily available a resource is. In my fantasy novel, the society in question has a population where roughly 1/4 of the people know magic. With magic, a person is able to create something out of thin air with the power of thought and some other tools such as wands or cauldrons. This would mean that magic is a renewable source and only requires time and food to be replenished before it can be used again. Considering this detail, would it make sense for things made from magic to be free to the public or incredibly cheap? Or should there be a cost on magic-related things to compensate for the food that is needed to replenish a magic-user's body? What if the food that was made to replenish magical energy was made with a magical spell?

This scenario is a tad ridiculous but I would like your input on how an economy that is partly based on money and partly based on magic would work.

t3_2jm60w,"I have a question that's been bothering me for a while, about math/physics and money policy. How are the policies of the Fed any different than a driven harmonic oscillator?","In intro physics in college, we learned about ""harmonic oscillators"". 

A standard harmonic oscillator looks like a sine wave. It would be an Austrian economist's view of economic cycles. 

One kind is called a ""damped harmonic oscillator"". It's when a pendulum swings and gradually runs out of energy. This is what a Keynesian sees as economic cycles, and why they feel that stimulus is necessary, to fight the forces of deflation.

Another kind is called a ""driven harmonic oscillator"". This is like when you jump on a trampoline and time your jump to match the upswing of the trampoline surface. One feature of this is that it keeps magnifying the oscillation until it hits some final quantity (your legs are only so powerful or the trampoline breaks). A graph looks [like this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/oscdr2.html#c3).

Based on the way that the Fed responds to financial crises, I can't see how they're any different than a driven harmonic oscillator working with the resonant frequency of our economic cycles. They are designed to start pumping on the downswing and stop pumping when ""momentum"" is gained, and the amount increases proportionally to the downswing. 

If you look at charts of stimulus vs. total increase in money supply/equities prices, it looks exactly like a harmonic oscillator in a physics experiment.

t3_2jrk0n,"A useful way to think about what ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" really means in a society","So it's easy to get confused by what those terms really mean. I will give clarification as I understand it. It's important to note that if something is expensive, it's not because a lot of money was spent on it. The money is a symptom of something else that's going on. The money is merely the result of activity that is going on, not the cause. It's merely showing what's happening.

What do I mean. Imagine two separate groups of 10 people. In one group, people generally trust each other. In the other, people are more mistrustful. This is regardless of what is used as money. Let's say you want to organize a business meeting between two members in each group of people. In the group where everyone generally trusts each other, it will be quite easy to organise the meeting. But not only that, the parties involved won't demand much payment, since they can trust that the other person won't try to cheat or harm them. And so if we consider a resource pool between the 10 people, those two people won't demand much of those resources in order to meet. It's 'cheap'.

But what about the second group? Well, if people are mistrustful, they would be hesitant to meet, even if it could be a good opportunity. Each party might feel that the other will harm them or try to cheat them, so they will be on their guard. But in order to facilitate this meeting, it will be 'expensive'. If each party is to show up to the meeting, they will demand a larger share of resources for their participation, because they want compensation in advance. Those people want to have more resources compared to the others in their group since they're taking a risk meeting someone else.

So it's not the money that's being spent that decides if something is cheap. This is happening after the fact, as you can see in the simplified examples. You will find that richer countries tend to have the most trusting citizens. It's easy to say that bring rich makes you more trusting; but it's actually the reverse. It's being trusting that will generally make you richer as a society.

The Erg could be said to represent the ""right to consume"" x number of Kilowatts.

t3_2mffy6,Why we are so obsessed with rational expectation in Macroeconomics? Student looking for genuine answers.,"Im a student in Australian completing my second year in my economist degree. I am currently finishing up on my third Macro course called Macro Policy. 

As i am only a second year university student, I'm not claiming to know everything about rational expectations, more trying to understand why it appears to be deemed necessary to economic thinking. I have done a single course in Behavioural and Evolutionary Economics and understand that there is other ways of going about the base assumptions of human economic decision making. I also understand the origins of where rational expectations arose in micro, and the assumptions that someone would know everything about a particular market isn't that crazy. But shifting that assumption into the macro world just makes the assumptions ludicrous.  

I have been learning a lot about how the assumption of rational expectations can provide a lot of rational for free market policies, as it shows the ineffectiveness of government. There are Monetary and Fiscal policies ineffectiveness theories that require rational expectations. 

So far as I understand it seems to quite well known that there are severe flaws in the use of rational expectations, particularly in Macro, but it seems people don't care. The main reason i can understand that people don't care is provides a basis for making mathematical predictions, as if people were perfectly rational it becomes simple to model.
The thing I find frustrating about this is it doesn't seem based in reality and people just make theories or adjustments to fit their data well after the fact.

The thing I'm trying to clarify is, are we just using rational expectations because it is the easiest to use and allows us to do fancy mathematics or are we doing it because it actually works. If it is the later I seem to be missing something critical information or have been misinformed  somewhere.

After looking through this article:

___________________

I found this graph (showing Fed balance sheet as % of GDP)

http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/2014/a/images/fig2_balancesheet.png

_________________

We can see that as a % of GDP, 1945 and 2014 are very similar.   

**We can also see there was a gradual unwinding of the Feds Balance sheet from 1945-1984...going from 20% of GDP to 5% of GDP.  How was this possible?**
_____________________
as alway interest rates are very important:

-The 10 year gov interest rate throughout the 1940s and 1950s stayed at under 3% until 1958

-Throughout the 1960s it gradually wnet from 3% to 6%

-Throughout th 1970s it gradually wnet from 6% to 12%

-1980-1984 saw interest rates stay in the 11-15% range

_______________________

at this point i'm assuming you know how the fed/treasury create money...if not see linked comment below for my 1 page quick description:

http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/2obgam/my_analysis_how_the_fed_unwound_its_balance_sheet/cmlitwf

__________________

So, if you want to decrease the Fed's balance sheet, you must decrease the supply of money in the system

How does this work? Treasury must issue new t-Bills to pay back principal on old t-bills to the Fed...These new t-bills (issued gradually from 1950-1984 or so) are paid for by general public with fed Notes...this reduces fed notes/money supply in circulation. So public gives fed notes to Treasury in exchange for new t-bills.  Treasury gives these just received fed notes back to Federal Reserve as principal payment for old t-bills issued in/around 1945). This reduces the Fed's balance sheet as the Federal Reserve gets more and more fed notes back from the Treasury (who in turn got those same fed notes from the general public in exchange for new bills).  Overall money supply decreases in proportion to amt that the Treasury has to pay back to the Fed. Is this what happened from 1945-1984? and is it reasonable to expect the same going forward (2015-2055)?

Lets look at the numbers:



Year | Fed Balance Sheet as % of GDP | M2 Money Supply as % of GDP 
---|---|----|----|----
1945 | 20% | 70% |
1984 | 5% | 55% |

**We can see that we basically traded a lower money supply in the general economy for a lower fed balance sheet.  15% of GDP over 40 years (0.375% of GDP per year)...Not too bad! very gradual reduction in the money supply and Fed balance sheet.  Slow enough to not cause any major major shocks** (i realize 1945-1984 did have problems, but no huge depressions)
_____

**Today the Fed balance sheet as a % of GDP is about 20%.  M2 Money Supply as a % of GDP is at about 65%.  If we can graudally move M2 to GDP ratio to 50%, we should get a Fed balance sheet of 5% of GDP by 2050 or so without any major disruptions.  Thoughts?**  


Tl;DR Fed Balance Sheet went from 20% of GDP in 1945 to 5% of GDP in 1984...accomplished by the shrinking of money supply from 70% of GDP in 1945 to 55% in 1984.  As Fed Balance Sheet increases, money supply increases, and visa versa.  We can do something similar going forward without an appocolypse",7,0.72,1417741556.0

t3_2ptynj,Debt And Bank Notes For Money Are Obsolete In A Future Economy,"In industrial economies where people labor to produce goods and services, money/currency is bank notes. 

Bank notes can only be created when banks make loans. Banks make loans to people based on their assets and expectations of future production (ie students). As the banks make more loans, there is more money in circulation. When banks slow lending, economies crash because there is not enough bank notes to service the growing debt plus interest.

In future economies, more of the production will be automated and/or digitized. The need for resources and people to labor will be greatly reduced. Many service jobs will be replaced by Artificial Intelligence. 

Already banks are finding it difficult to make loans as life becomes more efficient and productive. It is becoming impossible for students to pay back their debts due to lack of decent jobs. So to keep the game going banks are lending to government to create bank notes and then government is handing out the money to people often to labor in unnecessary jobs.

In a technologically advanced society, we don't need banks to make loans to government to create money. Government can create money without using banks as an intermediary. Banks were needed to make loans to private parties so people could have money to grow labor based economies. But with big data and AI driving unprecedented efficiency, we don't need bankers anymore in their traditional roles.

Debt and Bank notes for money were great in an era of human labor and private production. But with automation and artificial intelligence transforming culture and life, it's time to advance how we allocate goods and services beyond bank notes in a world where more things can be sustainably produced in unlimited quantities and given to everyone for virtually free.

It is clear that the debt and bank note game is coming to an end. Going forward, people will need a new form of digital money to get things technology produces while people will be free to evolve beyond labor for bank notes created out of debt.

If two economies don’t allow the free movement of people, the free movement of goods and capital alone is much more likely to be screwing someone over… probably many from both sides in different ways in the long run.  It can easily cause a distorted playing field unable to correct itself due to the captivity of people within a national prison.

So why is the free movement of people so rarely discussed when people argue about the benefits and issues surrounding free trade and its supposed benefits and issues? It seems like a connection worthy of more consideration.

> **Money is a matter of functions four.**

> **A medium, a measure, a standard, a store.**

As a Technology enthusiast today who reads a lot about **[Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)**, I couldn't help wonder that it certainly satisfies all the four conditions that makes a currency work in an Economy:

* It is a medium of exchange (you can trade in **BTC** for buying/selling goods).
* It is a measure of value (you may value your laptop for say 1.5 BTC).
* A standard currency unit (you can measure BTC against USD, 1BTC=~300USD)
* A store of value (you can convert all of your existing assets to BTC and treat them as an asset).

The only thing working against the acceptance of BTC are perhaps some Central Banks and Governments.

This creates an interesting scenario in Economics. What do you thing John Maynard Keynes or Adam Smith would have said about Bitcoin as a currency if they were there today?

t3_2qwjse,"Who caused the Housing bubble? Fanny Mae/Fred Mac, or private banks?","On one hand, there's the argument that the FNMA and FHLMC ('Fanny Mae' and 'Freddy Mac') buying low quality mortgages to make mortgages more 'affordable' led to inflation of demand for mortgages that otherwise wouldn't have been approved, and this is what largely led to the housing bubble. These two GSEs (government sponsored enterprise) held 70% of subprime mortgages at their peak, as evidence of this, it is argued.

The counter argument is as follow: in fact, the bubble took off in 2003-2004 when, as wikipedia claims ""The market shifted away from regulated GSE's and radically toward Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) issued by unregulated private-label securitization conduits, typically operated by investment banks."" In other words, banks started selling mortgages to 'unregulated' securitizers, and they were the ones who really brought down lending standards. It is further claimed that the Fanny and Freddy held loans actually performed better than privately held loans. I have also heard it claimed that in fact Fanny and Freddy held only small shares of the subprime market, and that the 70% figure is ""propaganda."" Furthermore, it is claimed that Fanny and Freddy only 'nominally' guaranteed subprime loans. I do not know what that is even supposed to mean.

Obviously, both the GSEs and the private actors contributed, but which was the driving force? Are the right-leaning sources downplaying the role of private investment banks and exaggerating the role of Fanny and Freddy, or are left-leaning sources exaggerating the role of unregulated private investment banks and downplaying the role of Fanny and Freddy?

Although the sector benefited from an unexpected drop in interest rates and outperformed in 2014, yields are likely to rise this year.

It starts off as a meme of with some gold bricks and the caption ""The dollar was backed by this""; then cuts to a picture of an aircraft carrier with the caption ""Now its backed by this"".

----------------------------------------------------

cWe need to take this understanding to the masses so that we stand up together and say ""no more!"" and ""not in our name!"" The value of the dollar is backed by ""oil dollars"" and everything you consume is tied to other countrys' needs to have ""petrodollar reserves"" just to run their economies. What will the U.S. do when other countries STOP TRADING OIL WITH U.S. CURRENCY? What have they done in the past?

  


Shad Walker To bad gold is still Fiat. So even when the dollar is back by gold, it is still really only backed by some peoples emotional response of ""want"" to something shiny.

Mira Siente anything we put ""faith"" in can be currency. What do you think will replace our currency system in the future? Got any good ideas?

Shad Walker Ohh personally I would just like to see us get away from money period. Once you start regulating such systems, that employ money, to the level that would be needed to avoid silly games and loopholes, money itself becomes a moot middle step of resource 

Mira Siente the problem is the concentration of people in one place so now we have people living on top of people and the means to feed and supply for our needs doesn't come from the land or natural resources- it comes from selling our labor and then exchanging our loot for the things we need to survive. How do we unravel a society dependant on money for survival? I am with you on getting rid of money and going back to a simpler, productive life/society.


Shad Walker We produce enough food for about 12 billion people, and only have about 7 billion on the planet. That is an extra 5 billion people worth of food. Really, it just comes down to us doing it.

Shad Walker I would like to see a Democratic Resource Based Economy Nation. Granted, it would work best worldwide, but there are some countries that have the natural resources to pull it off on a National Level.

Mira Siente Who controls the means to produce that much food? The ownership is not shared so profit and control and using labor to make it happen. Money is involved in that equation.

Shad Walker If we could get the entire planet in about 3 ""sections"", the Democratic RBE nation, then another section of good arable land for anybody who didn't want to be part of that society. They could go live off the grid, peacefully. Build their own homes, etc.

Shad Walker No money is involved, much of the labor would be automated, we have the tech and know how to pull it off. Vertical farms and such. You can get an idea of the kind of designs I am talking about from the Venus Project.

Mira Siente and what about the other people not wanting either of those?

Mira Siente I'm familiar with the concept and the project.

Shad Walker Life doesn't provide us with our little heart's every desire. One will have to cry to whatever higher power they believe in about that. This is about creating a sustainable system that promotes peaceful living as best as we humanly can.

Shad Walker But I do also believe in wilderness survival / natural living education in our school systems, so if someone does decide to live out in the off the grid zone, they know how to live naturally.

Shad Walker That is the best and closest we can come to the idea of Freedom as humans. You are not being coerced to stay as part of the society by fear of death. You would know you could go off to the other ""zone"" and make it no problem. Even start towns and such out there in which the people decide on other types of systems to employ.

Mira Siente Who stands in the way of making your vision work? There are people in every country that wants to make it happen but there are macro and individual forces that don't want your vision. They like the dismal, unfair alternative and they are more powerful than people like us.

Shad Walker Hrmmm, that is a good question. I would say at this point, it would be the elite oligarchy, and the masses to an extent. The oligarchy because hey, they don't want to loose their power. And the masses just because they don't know anything else then what they've been trained to know. And they are caught up in all the consumerism and toys.

Shad Walker Mainly, it would just be getting the other zone not to go so crazy in resource acquisition that they lead back into the problems we see today; ie pollution and depleting natural resources, especially to the extent where it makes an impact on the other parts of the planet and life.

Mira Siente What part of the planet is doing this at the moment? How do the people make new towns? Do they have to move to be a part of the community? Like I said, most like the status quo and don't want to change anything. But I hear you. We need to get off the grid. But even if you do, there will be millions of people wanting to experience a capitalist, consumerist lifestyle (McDonalds are in every part of the world right now). 

Shad Walker Ohh, I still see restaurants and such in this vision. It is much akin to Star Trek the Next Generation style Earth. There would be forms of entertainment, toys, restaurants and such, just not at a crazy level that depletes the natural resources and such. Getting down to exact minuta is difficult at this point, would need access to information I don't have access too along with bean counters to start counting numbers and see where all the resources stand at. 

Shad Walker As for parts of the planet, I know Mr. Fresco has been to different countries promoting his idea and a few of them have put banners up. I have also seen small scale RBE communities trying to start up, but nothing large scale that I am aware of.

BUILD A HYBRID RBE COMMUNITY NOW 

Shad Walker Getting over the Capitalistic/Consumerist mindset is a hurdle, but it is also what is destroying us. An ugly conundrum.

Mira Siente supply and demand. People demand their toys and trinkets but not feeding the world proper nutrition. Food is thrown into the ocean to keep the future speculation commodity price up. The big question is do we create a euphoric society or go after the dominant forces or do we do both? Education is key to make people wake up. They've been trying to wake people up for a long time, We've got to do better and try harder.

Shad Walker I guess the simple way to put it would be Military Style without the Military Feel. Realty is, the American Military Structure (along with most militarizes) is a highly Socialist Structure. You participate and you get housing, food, medical care, access to entertainment, etc. Along with a monetary stipend.

Shad Walker Highly logistics based, how much do we actually have, how much do we actually need, how do we allocate it, and how do we make sure we are not depleting it.

Mira Siente I think a spiritual paradigm shift needs to occur before a RBE can be enacted on a large scale (where people want to make sure they care about future generations and depleted/low natural resources). Like I said, they've got us all living in cities. By 2050, 75% of the world population will be living in cities. Very strong political groups and cliches are and will be running them (city council/business partners/investors). Where will the ordinary people and people living off the grid fit into this reality? 

Shad Walker Well there seems to be a paradigm shift occurring; more people are becoming aware.

As to the cities and clicks and such, not too much a concern of mine. The logistics is fairly easy to deal with, that is all hard science and numbers. So can calculate the amount of resources along with how to make sure we are not depleting and polluting them.

It is the social issues that it becomes grey. Personally I am a fan of a fairly liberal social structure, and if there are more conservative “clicks” within the large liberal structure, that is cool too. Birds of a feather tend to flock together; they just have to remember not to let such trivial issues (ie nudist versus non-nudist) get in the way of the bigger picture. They are still all on the same team, each providing to a society in which we create a comfortable lifestyle with plenty of luxuries.

As to the “off the grid” people that you asked about, I would need to know, do you mean people who want to live “off the grid” within that society or the “off the grid” in the other zone? 

Mira Siente Both groups... Back to trying to wrangle control back from the people in power on the local level mainly, but moving further out to the states and on a national level. In the U.S., this concept/project is nowhere near launching and is in the infancy stages of development. Looking at this from an abstract view point is only a percentage of what needs to be done. Years still in the making and more people understanding that the current system isn't working and we need another type of society. Not only that, there will be an anti-movement group forming to silence the RBE movement There are people who think this is communism and they are not going to allow us to move towards a RBE. 

Shad Walker Ohh it has been getting the hush treatment for years. Heck, Mr. Fresco has been talking about this since the 1970's and was even on Larry King.

Shad Walker As to the communism thing, people just have to be ""un-brain washed"" so to speak. This country has been spewing out propaganda about different economic systems since at least the 1950's if not longer. Most don't even realize that economic systems and political systems are 2 different things.

That is why there are Democratic Socialist Nations; and you can even make Democratic Communist Nations.

They have been trained to auto respond to those words like a Pavloivan Dog responds to the sound of a bell.

If they can get through that, then they can start looking at these things clearly. 

Shad Walker Inanimate systems, each have their strengths and weaknesses. And some are just so flawed, they don't work at all without resets, ie Capitalism. Even ancient man knew it get imbalanced and needed periodic resets; Leviticus 25 and the Time of Jubilee is once such example of ancient people knowing this.

t3_2sbez0,A Question Regarding Superannuation (Aus/wherever relevant),"Hi all, first time poster here - Apologies if not posting in appropriate section.

Something I have been thinking about recently, but haven't come to a conclusion on, is the consequences of a campaign to re-divert super funds to one 'scheme'  (i.e local shares, property, cash) en-mass. 

So let's say 'most' super funds remain as established for employees and are conservatively spread across a range of investment options.

If over the next week millions of fund owners changed their investment options to, lets say, solely local shares, in effect moving funds from all sorts of other options - What impact would this likely have?

Based on my own super fund experience the 'local shares' options invests in mainstream 'top ten' listed companies - So to build on my scenario here let's say 1 million people (all with super finances spread across a number of options) moved to 100% local shares. Beforehand they all had $40,000 of super funds with 5% as ""cash"". Already this means:
$2,000 ($40K * 0.05) * 1,000,000 = $2Bil invest in local shares (probable top 10-20 'blue chips) in a week.

The other affects would be funding removed from property, overseas shares and cash holdings.

t3_2taepb,Why when the supply quantity the price per unit increases? instead of decreasing?,"I'm reading ""Economics For Dummies"" and they state that the supply price per unit increase when the the quantity increases.

All my life I've seen that when you supply more quantity the cost per unit is lower and not higher.

Why here is not like this? I really feel that I'm missing the point of the supply curve. I'm a newbie so, please enlight me (:

thanks


**Edit:**

Let's break it down. The costs for a factory are these:

 - People: 10000€/month fixed
 - Electricity of offices: 500€/month almost fixed and has little variation based on quantity
 - Electricity based on quantity: 1€/unit (so if I produce 100 units I spend 100€ on electricity)

Now if I sell the units at a fixed price of 2€:

 - I sell 1 unit/month. Costs: 10000+500+1*1=10501€. Cost per unit: 10501€. Revenue: 2€. Profit: -10499. Profit per unit: -10499.
 - I sell 1000 units/month. Costs: 10000+500+1*1000=11501€. Cost per unit: 11.5€. Revenue: 2000€. Profit: -9501. Profit per unit: -9.501
 - I sell 100000 units/month. Costs: 110500€. Cost per unit: 1.1€. Revenue: 200000€. Profit: 89500. Profit per unit: 0.89

Can you see how the quantity actually reduces the costs?

Of course this might depend by what those people do, but even if you need to add extra people your price drops as quantity increases. Even today I've asked a graphic company to print something.

 - 1000 units is at 1.13€/unit;
 - 10000 units is at 1.01€/unit;

The price almost always drop when you buy/supply more quantity.

Let's take the farmer again:

 - His home costs are: 200€/month;
 - Home bills: 100€/month
 - Terrain rent (max capacity for 1000KG): 100€/month
 - Water for terrain: 1€/kg of product.

Money per KG:

 - Total cost for 1KG: 200+100+100+1*1=401€; Unit cost: 401€ Too much
 - Total cost for 10KG: 400+10=410€; Unit cost: 41€ Too much
 - Total cost for 100KG: 400+100=500€; Unit cost: 5€ Already earning 5€ per KG
 - Total cost for 1000KG: 400+1000=1400€; Unit cost: 1.4€ Earning 8.6€ per KG

Now if ""if I offer the farmer $10/kg, how many Kg would he want to sell me"" I would sell you 1000KG and I would expand my garden. I will pay some people to work for me so the capacity increase to 100000KG, at this capacity the KG price willl not drop much more than 1.4€ because of the increased fixed costs.",5,0.73,1421935803.0

t3_2u5g7c,A Theory on the US Economic System,"Hi r/economy, I'd like to bounce some thoughts off of you.

Seems like wage stagnation is becoming a popular topic of discussion of late. My facts may not be dead on, but please work with me. Do correct me if you have a better concept of the facts as I do not claim to be an economist. 

From what I understand, the general state of wages is that middle class income has not grown since before 2008 (I think there's been considerable shrinkage, actually, due to the recession), and even since the 70's wages have hardly paced with inflation. As more and more wealth becomes concentrated at the top, and debts continue to grow for middle class families (student loans, credit cards, etc.), I can't help but start to see how these pieces seem to fit together in ways that could be more than just incidental. 

As the market expands and the top continues to grow their margins and hide their profits in tax shelters, the rest of the population is left with a smaller piece of economic pie available relative to market growth. This results in having less free capital to spend while costs grow across the board, putting people in a position where they need to borrow more to meet their needs. Since not everyone could qualify for loans to cover things like education, the gov. started facilitating loan qualification/availability in order to encourage more people to achieve higher education. The great availability in funding inevitably inflated education costs - a vicious cycle. 

Again, we're seeing the top take a big chunk of that growth, in this case university presidents raking in millions, which contributes to the inflated education costs.

I cannot draw a straight line through all the details to illustrate the trend, but is there an argument to be made that the uber wealthy have found themselves in a situation where they can suppress the rest of the population *just enough* that people become dependent on borrowing funds to succeed, or even survive - funds that the uber wealthy have stake in, earning them further profits? It's kind of like they're double dipping in the broken system.

This kind of market segmentation is much more compliant with the free market principles of neoliberalism. As it teaches people the value of money.

Now, you introduce a new bank in the village called Banko and a currency called pebbles. (For simplicity, lets assume that Banko is both a central bank and also lends/borrows money).

Now in order to leave barter and migrate to currency system, the villagers will have to either borrow pebbles from Banko, or sell their goods to them. So, there is a ""give"" and ""take"" or exchange of pebbles against goods.

But at the end of the day, if you consider the **overall macro-economic position**, the pebbles made no difference in *value* at all.  The villager's **NET WORTH** is same as it was before, the pebbles just facilitates transactions and used to count their assets now.

Obviously it is necessary at some point to bring rates off the floor they have been on for the last several years. What I see as a problem though is that the U.S. seems to be to the only country looking to increase interest rates, and the USD is already very strong against other major currencies. The USD has climbed strongly in the past year to few years against major currencies such as the Euro, Yen, CAD, AUD, BRL, INR, RUB, ZAR. The only major free floating currencies it hasn't outperformed recently are CHF and GBP, although USD vs GBP has been strong in recent months, but this followed a significant decline in 2013 to mid 2014. Increasing interest rates will further increase the value of the USD against other currencies.

To me it seems that continued growth in the value of the USD presents a serious risk to US economic growth. There has been a significant increase in the amount of manufacturing jobs in the US in the past few years after so many were lost in the years leading up to the economic crash, but if the USD grows even stronger I would have to imagine this would erode to competitiveness of these manufactured goods for export markets. This loss of competitiveness seems to me to be a serious threat to undue much of the growth that has happened in the past few years in the US.

t3_2zguwr,Economic Idea For Fixing Unemployment,"I'm not an economist by trade, but I had an idea and wanted to know if anyone on /economy could tell me how practical or viable it sounds, for fixing the job crisis.

Let's say someone is long term unemployed, they receive no unemployment checks, and only have their savings to live on until they find something.  Lets also say they do some form of work, such as taking care of their elderly parents, or community service, something they could conceivably be paid to do.

If you could document, and prove to the government, that you do something the least bit productive to contribute to the whole of society, even if its redeeming soda cans, why not get some kind of paycheck from the government for it?

It would create jobs, it would put money into the pockets of people who desperately need it, it would create workers that would have to claim their earnings doing whatever it was they were formerly doing for free, which would in turn increase the government's tax revenue, and stimulate spending.  In other words, why not formalize, or legitimize the underground economy?

Take anyone that's making money under the table, or even doing something for nothing, like volunteer work, declare them self-employed, compensate them a livable wage, and add untold numbers of new workers to the economy, and improve the unemployment rate.

This isn't even a guaranteed minimum income idea, implying someone could get paid just for existing.  You would still have to report, or somehow prove that you're doing something.  We could even create a new profession of people whose job it would be to check in on the ex-informal economy workers if it has to be proved that they're contributing something.

The government and society potentially loses millions of dollars if not more from the underground economy.  Why not dignify what people have to do to survive, by declaring them employed and cutting them a check, if it could mean the difference between staying solvent or slipping into poverty?

>This post should be read by many economists who misunderstand the difference between nominal and real interest rates and who think that central banks can control any single monetary variable. I would like to highlight some valid points and make some comments/criticisms:

>- Central banks can only try to fix short-term nominal interest rates; they are not generally able to fix neither long-term interest rates nor the real return on capital. This is true. However, this does not mean that central banks do not influence both. 1º Long-term interest rates should just depend on the long-term supply and demand of capital, but the banking system can modify that equilibrium with maturity mismatching: the practise of borrowing short and lending long sets long-term rates at “artificially low levels” (savers' and investors' time frames are not coordinated from a macroeconomic point of view). Central banks help the banking system to amplify maturity mismatching by providing them with a liquidity safety net. 2º Real return on capital is not an independent variable of malinvestments and overindebtedness: therefore, if maturity mismatching can explain (as I think it can) most of cyclical malinvestment and overindebtedness, then central banks do influence real return on capital.

>- Central banks are not responsible of current ultra-low return on capital (ultra-low interest rates), economic crisis and deleveraging are. Another valid point. Ultra-low rates are not mainly an issue of excessive supply of credit but of lack of new demand for credit. However, it is difficult to think that central banks’ quantitative easings do not have any responsibility in negative interest rates. If you multiply cash availability when no good investment opportunities exist, one will have to store that extra-cash somewhere. Money storage is expensive and Treasury liabilities may be a good deal even at negative interest rates.

>- It is true that central banks must fix some interest rate under a fiat money system. They cannot avoid it as they are the ones in charge of regulating dynamically the monetary base. Therefore it is also true that central bankers need to wonder whether they are fixing a too high or too low rate. However, I have two deep disagreements with the rest of the reasoning. First, central banks interest rates should not depend on the macroeconomic performance of the economy: that is the role of the real return on capital (of real interest rates), not of short-term nominal interest rates. Preferential short-term interest rates (i.e., central bank intervention rates) are a way of advancing money to accrued real earnings (i.e., of providing liquidity where real liquidity pre-exists and is needed, as Bagehot clearly understood): therefore, preferential short-term rates should only depend on lender and borrower liquidity, not on the CPI, the rate of growth and the level of unemployment. The purpose of stimulating the economy by lowering short-term interest rates is tantamount to create a lending boom by stimulating banks to arbitrage short-term and long-term interest rates. This is, I am afraid, a very dangerous path of future malinvestments, bubbles and overindebtedness. Second disagreement: central banks only need to actively fix interest rates under a fiat money system: under a gold standard, interest rates are passively fixed by the evolution of central bank reserves. As I see it, nowadays central bankers do not have any good yardstick for fixing short-term interest rates: they can only try to guess what proper rates should be without actually knowing it and, therefore, without actually knowing whether they are coordinating or discoordinating the real economy (something that was already debated in the Bullionist Controversy). Feedback information comes too late and its meaning is not always clear for central bankers (Are we in an asset bubble? Is the current path of lending sustainable? Has that sector grown too much due to slack credit conditions, etc.). In a sense, they suffer from an inability to apply economic calculation to their business: to be the banker of bankers. And the deep reason for this inability is the one I stated before: central banks should set short-term interest rates according to their liquidity situation, but unfortunately they are the ones in charge of creating the measure of liquidity (monetary base). In other words, what does it mean for a central bank to be “illiquid” under a fiat money system? No answer, no sensible monetary policy.",2,1.0,1427815886.0

t3_30vak0,Moody's: Northern Non-Conforming UK Borrowers Are Almost Twice Likely to be Caught In a Mortgage Debt Trap,"Moody's analysis reveals that the north-south divide persists in the UK's non-conforming mortgage market, as borrowers in the North are 1.9 times as likely to be mortgage prisoners than borrowers in other regions, says Moody's Investors Service in a sector comment published today. About 75% of non-conforming borrowers in north England and in Northern Ireland (together, the North) who took out interest-only loans when the market peaked in 2007 are mortgage prisoners.

Mortgage prisoners are borrowers who are unable to refinance to a better deal or move house because they fall outside lending criteria.

""The north-south divide remains firmly entrenched in the sector due to the North's weaker housing market and slower economic recovery,"" observes Emily Rombeau, a Moody's Analyst and author of the report. ""At 54%, over half of northern non-conforming borrowers are mortgage prisoners, compared with 32% of non-conforming borrowers in the rest of the country.""

Our research shows that about 40% of non-conforming borrowers are mortgage prisoners across the country. Our assessment corresponds to the share of borrowers who (1) have a mortgage with an indexed LTV ratio above 85%; or (2) are more than 30 days in arrears on their payments. An inability to keep up with monthly payments is the main reason for being a mortgage prisoner, accounting for 68% of trapped borrowers.

In southern England, non-conforming borrowers benefit from at least 9.4% increase in equity in their house on average. Southern England's housing market recovery has outpaced the rest of the country, with property prices rising above pre-crisis peaks in London and south east England.

We expect that the overall level of mortgage prisoners will continue to moderately decrease over the next 12 months. House price increases will reduce indexed loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, thereby enhancing borrowers' ability to refinance. The LTV ratio is a key driver of defaults in the UK non-conforming residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sector: loans with LTV ratios above 80% have a 2.2x greater likelihood of being repossessed.

In our base-case scenario, we have not taken borrowers' affordability into consideration when assessing their ability to refinance under current market conditions. We have also assumed that self-certified borrowers did not overstate their income at origination. For example, if we apply a 10% haircut to self-certified borrowers' income and consider that homeowners with a loan-to-income ratio above 3.5x cannot remortgage, the proportion of mortgage prisoners increases to 59% from 38%.

Moreover, if we assume lower indexed LTV ratio cut-off points for interest-only loans, a significantly larger proportion of borrowers would be trapped in their current mortgages. The share of mortgage prisoners rises to 74% from 38% if we assume that interest-only borrowers with an indexed LTV ratio above 50% cannot refinance.

t3_316dnp,U.S. ISM illustrates the impact of stronger dollar,"The modest decline in the ISM manufacturing index to a 12-month low of 51.5 in March, from 52.9, illustrates that the stronger dollar and soft overseas demand are still an obstacle for export-orientated producers. Other surveys indicate that the non-manufacturing sectors are still doing well, however, so the slowdown in manufacturing specifically is not overly alarming from a macro standpoint.

Looking at the detail, the new orders index fell to 51.8 in March, from 52.5. The new export orders index slumped to only 47.5, from 48.5, illustrating that the weakness in overall new orders is definitely linked to the stronger dollar. Otherwise, the production index actually rebounded to 53.8, from 53.7, suggesting that the unwinding of the bad weather distortion has translated into a bounce in output. Finally, the employment index edged down to 50.0, from 51.4.

t3_31rhsv,"The economics of virtual currencies: predicting the market impact of the ""WoW token""","An interesting change is being implemented today in one of the most well-established online game economies, World of Warcraft. Specifically, the game developer (Blizzard Entertainment) is introducing a mechanism whereby players can, for the first time, purchase ""gold,"" i.e., in-game currency, by giving real USD to Blizzard via the in-game store. Before today, players were only able to exchange USD for ""gold"" by going through third-parties (which violated the Blizzard TOS).

Tl;dr: For details on how these tokens will work, see [here.](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18141101/introducing-the-wow-token-3-2-2015)  

Brief explanation of the above link: If a player wants in-game gold, they purchase a WoW token through the in-game store. They then sell this token on the in-game auction house. They receive gold from the player who purchased the token. If a player wants to reduce their credit card expense for playing World of Warcraft, they go to the in-game auction house. They purchase a token that has been put up for sale by another player. They redeem it in-game. Their credit card is not charged by Blizzard during the next billing cycle. A monthly subscription to World of Warcraft costs approximately $15. Hence, it would be reasonable to suspect that tokens will cost ~$15 to purchase from the in-game store. Blizzard has intimated that buying a token on the in-game auction house for gold will cost ~30,000 gold. Implying an exchange rate of 2,000gold/$1.


My questions for this subreddit are:

1) What does economic history & theory tell us about how markets react when an authority takes action to curtail a black market? 

2) What will happen to the prices of goods in the WoW marketplace?

3) If you are a ""gold seller,"" i.e., one of the third parties that has in the past earned USD by acquiring in-game gold and then selling it to interested players via non-game channels, how do you react to the introduction of the WoW token? Exit the market? Simply change your pricing? Something else?

4) Is there any methodology one could use for forecasting the previously mentioned exchange rate of 2,000gold/$1USD?

t3_32hk2c,Medida Tributaria. Cambiar el Impuesto de Sociedades.,"Una de las cosas que menos me gusta de este sistema tributario, es que el Impuesto de Sociedades no discrimina a las empresas según sus actos. Es decir, las empresas pequeñas o medianas de pagan el 25% de lo que ganan creo que es, y las grandes empresas el 30%. 
El problema es el siguiente. Tenemos dos empresas pequeñas del mismo sector, por ejemplo dos empresas de transporte y almacenaje, y en mi empresa pagamos bien a todos los trabajadores y ningun jefe cobra ninguna burrada, utilizamos camiones que contaminan poco, y tenemos un rango de plusvalía bajo, ademas de que luego hacemos inversiones en obras sociales de la zona. La empresa competidora, les paga 4 € a sus peones mientras que los jefes se forran y utilizan camiones de los mas contaminantes por que les sale mas barato, ademas, les es mejor contratar a autónomos para que lleven ellos sus mercancías.
Pero ambas empresas pagan el 25% de impuestos. Por lo que la que se ara con el mercado, es claramente la segunda.

La Propuesta es la siguiente, ir cambiando progresivamente a lo largo de 4 años el Impuesto de Sociedades para que sea un impuesto por puntos. Un incentivo para que las empresas mejoren su calidad. De tal manera que si yo pago bien a mis trabajadores, tienen un buen seguro, mis camiones contaminan poco y los jefes no se forran con sueldos millonarios, igual pago el 15% de impuestos, y si hago lo contrario, igual pago el 35%. 
Este sistema de pagos adaptado a cada sector y ayudando a los sectores por ejemplo de industria e investigación creo yo que serian los que mas habría que fomentar. Pero eso ya según se mire.

Esto es un boceto de la idea que tengo en mente, y que tendría que ir progresivamente llegando. Año tras año y no un cambio de golpe, pero fomentar este sistema.",2,1.0,1428960009.0

t3_32myky,Moody's: Asian covenant quality for high-yield bonds holds steady; better than other regions,"
Moody's Investors Service says that Asian high-yield bonds issued in the first quarter of 2015 contain covenant protections that are stronger than those in other regions, and are on par with the protections for bonds issued in Asia in the previous quarter.

Moody's analysis is based on data from its High-Yield Covenant Database, which includes all rated high-yield bond deals that closed in each region during the quarter. A full discussion of Moody's results is included in its just-published report ""Asian Covenant Quality Remains Stronger Than Other Regions' in First Quarter of 2015"".

The overall average covenant quality score for rated Asian high-yield-bond deals issued in the first quarter of this year was at 2.63; similar to the 2.67 for deals issued in the fourth quarter of 2014, but weaker than the long-run cumulative average of 2.49 for the region.

Moody's measures bond covenant quality on a five-point scale, with 1.0 denoting the strongest investor protections and 5.0, the weakest and assesses bond protections against six risk areas: restricted payments, investments in risky assets, leverage, liens subordination, structural subordination and event risk (change of control).

""Asian covenant quality is good with a cumulative average of 2.49 at end of Q1 2015, which is significantly stronger than the global average of 3.37,"" says Jake Avayou, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Covenant Officer.

""We note that in Q1 2015, Indian bonds had the strongest covenant protections. Only Indian and Chinese companies issued bonds during this period,"" adds Avayou.

Moody's points out that the two Indian high-yield bonds issued in Q1 2015 contained fewer quantifiable restricted payments, risky investments, and debt carve-outs when compared with the other bonds issued in the same quarter.

Moody's notes that bond protections against three risk areas -- namely restricted payments, investments in risky assets and change of control -- weakened in the first quarter of 2015 from the protections seen in the last quarter of 2014.

When compared to Q4 2014, the restricted payment score weakened to 2.97 (moderate category) from 2.48 (good category), and the investments in risky assets score weakened to 3.45 (weak category) from 2.88 (moderate category).

The weakness was largely due to four Chinese property companies that pre-dated their income baskets to coincide with their previous bond issuances. This approach increases flexibility to pay dividends, buy back stock and make risky investments with money that could otherwise be used to service the bonds, and is a clear negative for bondholders.

In addition, two of the four Chinese property deals this quarter further weakened protections against risky investments by allowing free reclassification between their general permitted investment baskets and their restricted payments income baskets.

Moody's notes that the region's protection against event risk related to a change of control weakened to 2.11 in Q1 2015 from 1.71 in Q4 2014. The result was because Country Garden Holdings Company Limited's (Ba2 ratings under review for upgrade) and CAR Inc.'s (Ba1 stable) negative ratings conditions specify that triggering a put on the bonds requires a downgrade by two rating agencies if the notes are rated below investment grade by all three ratings agencies, rather than the usual one.

t3_32yzs8,Can anybody give me a good reason why the price of oil should continue to climb?,"So far I have been replied to with:


**OPEC controls the market** -  

*OPEC used to be the say all end all to oil. Their problem is very transparent now though. If they artificially inflate prices, they will lose market share to people who can produce oil at those higher prices. They have very cheap oil, and the only thing they can do is produce more of that cheap oil to hamper foreign production...but at the same time they are trying to keep prices inflated while pumping and selling as much oil as they can. They simply don't have as much power as they used to....because they don't have an option like they used to.*

**No I insist, OPEC controls the market because if they say they are going to cutback production, the price will jump**

*I think you are half right. If they said we're dropping production, yes prices would skyrocket....right along with everyone else's production, and then we would have a supply glut...kind of like right now. The thing is...they can't say they are decreasing production...and they don't want to say they are increasing...but they are.*

**Oil is too big to fail**

*So your best argument is that oil is too big to fail? The government is going to bail out oil companies if they go belly up? I think growth and profits accelerate when the price of energy comes down...I would think consolidation in the oil industry would just lead to organic economic growth...rather than a disaster. It would be a disaster to people who have invested too heavily in oil.*


**""because we depend on it"", ""oil is king"", ""energy density"", oh and corn...just fucking corn** http://redd.it/32tiu1  

*not going to reply, unless you insist*


**My own argument - The dollar could be on the decline**

*well semitard that is a good argument, why thank you semitard, but the problem is still there if the dollar inflates price...we have a supply glut. If the value of the dollar decreases, and oil continues to climb, it becomes economical for a lot of wells to come back online, and production will ramp, and at the same time, if prices are up, then demand will most likely go down. I suppose we could lift the export band at that point (or any point), but then what do you think OPEC will do?...not stop drilling and losing customers, that is for sure.*

**Rig count**

http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php
 
*Jaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*

http://247wallst.com/energy-business/2015/04/12/low-crude-oil-prices-leave-thousands-of-u-s-wells-uncompleted/ 

*There are roughly 2,500 to 3,500 drilled but uncompleted oil wells in the United States, according to analysts at IHS Inc. (NYSE: IHS). As many as 1,400 of those wells are located in the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas.*

*What do you think rig count is going to do if oil goes up?*

*Oh and plus, there are a lot of wells that still have to be completed by law...*

*Wells must be completed within one year of being drilled by state law. More than 100 wells will hit that deadline in June.*

**Demand is going to increase**

*This is highly speculative, and loses weight as prices increase...and in my opinion a little ignorant considering the current oversupply. I don't think that demand has had its run and is over. I think that the control over the price of oil has had its run, and is now over. Production and demand are going to dictate prices, not so much politics and geology.*

**Iran deal is going to fall through**

*Probably, maybe not. Doesn't change the fact that they are increasing production and still have outlets to sell their oil.*

**Everyone including Goldman Sachs say oil will fall to new lows, I do the opposite**

*This pisses me off that I have to add this, but apparently a lot of people agree (which in itself is funny). Ok...so all the info available, and the people familiar with the situation are expecting the price of oil to go down...so naturally you are a genius contrarian investor that is about to make a killing. So that means you must have bought WTI when it was in the $40's, and when everyone was scared it would keep going down (like all the info suggest). Now what? Oil is up about 30% from that low...when people were being ""greedy"". You think oil is going to just keep shooting up? How much more? 40%, 50%, 220%? If you are buying up oil now, I would say you're jumping on a retard fueled band wagon, you are not being greedy, you are not being a contrarian investor, you are being a fucktard (if this is your'e only argument). You might be able to make an argument about being greedy when oil goes back down to the $40 range, but I think I'm going to wait for more like the low $30. Also, I think the fact this same post got down voted to 0 in /r/stocks proves my point as well.*

**Big picture.. we are barely oversupplied. When you talk millions yeah reserves can build up**

*I agree, but oversupplied none the less...and reserves are still building. If the price of oil goes up, even more will go into storage, I think we agree here.*

**Not to mention there are still emerging markets where oil will become a necessity on top of the fact that the population of the world is not diminishing. It's expanding exponentially**

*Silly thing about humanity is that we evolve, technology evolves, infrastructure for emerging markets evolve. I completely agree that demand will increase. Emerging markets will grow...even faster with cheap energy. Renewable energy will still keep growing faster. Can you imagine how much different the world will be once we can harness fusion power? Anyhow, daily dependence on oil will decrease over time. And, we add about 1 billion people every 15 years...since about 1960, not exactly exponential (thanks for making me look that up.)*

**Finally shale wells peter out fast**

*yeah, I think it's like 90% of production is the first 2 years. We have somewhere between 2500 and 3500 wells just waiting to start producing though...*

**Another conflict will spill over some borders in the Middle East**

*This is probably the best argument I have got yet, and one that I'm fairly ill equipped to argue. I can say that it is highly speculative, but not really far fetched. I do feel like bringing an end to the control over oil could help the middle east get together for the better good of their nations to export as much oil as they can, but I feel like I should slap myself for saying that.* 

**a discovery completely undermining the estimated reserves left**

*again, very speculative for near term, but not far fetched...and something we should be expecting in the future, but how far into the future...who knows. I do know we are growing less dependent on oil, and are moving towards renewables, plus technology evolves.  Since we are being speculative, I pose this question...What happens to the world once humanity figures out how to harness fusion power?...there will be a lot of people who will give a lot less fucks about oil when that happens (and we are very close).*",6,1.0,1429308797.0

*Why? Because it's not a private business over there. Fiscal breakeven pays for a majority of their ""government"" expenditures....including subsidies and royal privileges. The cost that it actually takes them to produce a barrel of oil is actually the cheapest on earth. They have been so used to relying on oil production, and having the ability to manipulate the market, that they have grown very used to making a very wide margin. The profits from oil in Saudi Arabia account for ~80% of what the ""government"" spends....which is why on the above Thompsan Reuters chart, it says their breakeven is ~$93.*

The thing is, is that this is a bit of an economic war that is going on. Guess who is good at war...and economics? There is a bit of chess going on right now. Shale put OPEC in check. OPEC's only option is to adjust. There is a lot of corruption, a lot of waist, a lot of arrogance...that just got put into check. So it's their move. From the looks of things, I would say they are hell bent on applying the pressure back on Shale...which will work (hasn't quite yet)...but, (I believe at least) it will drive out some competition for a bit...no, not forever. They are going to have to diversify their economies....which is a good thing. Saudi Arabia has openly admitted to this, as well as Putin...and they have been working on it. So, what am I saying? What I have been saying, supply and demand are going to dictate the price of oil....not so much politics and geology. Right now we are oversupplied, and that is going to get worse...for now.*

**why would OPEC shoot themselves in the foot to regain market share from US Shale, that will just as quickly be lost?  Possibly the U.S. hired OPEC to drop oil prices to put the hurt on Russia for the whole Ukraine/Crimea situation last year, which comes with the added benefit of boosting the US economy.** /r/KU76

*I have been beating my head to understand how Russia ties into all this...I've been especially curious as to the recent deviation the Ruble has taken from the price of oil. Most recent signs say that Russia's economy is on the rebound...which doesn't make a whole lot of since in my book. If there are some behind the scenes maneuvering going on, I would say that Russia is doing really good at withstanding it so far, and that gives me more reason to suspect that this June meeting will maintain the current course, until some hurt starts really getting applied to where it is intended to be directed, be it shale or Russia.*

**Also, the majority of new discoveries are shale, deepwater or tar sands. These all need oil around $100 to be viable.** /r/the_ultravixens

*http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php
Jaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*

oil sands

*Breakeven costs for existing projects such as Kearl Phase 1 stand at US$42 per barrel, with Husky’s Lloydminster (US$28), Cenvous’ Christina Lake ($26) and Suncor operations (US$30.3), all comfortably below WTI’s current price of US$46 per barrel, Citibank data shows.*

Deepwater

*the average breakeven oil price needed for new deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments in early stages of construction is between $65 and $75 per barrel. That “breakeven” implies a long-term annualized 10% return on capital.*

*Now, there was a lot more money being thrown at all these projects when oil was over $100, and I do agree that there will be a lot less investment if oil stays, or decrease...but like a said, there has already been significant investment in projects to keep supply climbing for the next several years.*

**If you look at the finances of the shale drillers, nobody was running a positive cashflow at $100 per barrel, so there is simply no way that breakevens are $45 outside of the most prolific core areas.** /r/the_ultravixens

*I believe we agree that the most costly oil is deepwater...so I looked up Seadrill's EPS from Q1 '14, and it was $1.58...they most certainly were making money.*

**Wind and solar provide around 1% of global energy, and it's all in the form of electricity. They currently do not fuel aeroplanes, trucks, boats or combine harvesters. In the timescales we're discussing (up to maybe 5-10 years max) they are irrelevant.** /r/the_ultravixens

*You are right here, they are still in their infancies. This section is growing very quickly. The technology is growing, the infastucture is growing, and the efficiency is growing. I think it will still be ~3 decades before we are running off renewable energy...I'm hoping for sooner, but we will most certainly have enough oil to make it*",4,0.66,1429462035.0
t3_33abf7,IMF tells regulators to brace for global 'liquidity shock',"It's the economy, no it's the debt, no it's the derivatives.  Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter recently called for the elimination of cash which would also include higher forms of taxation on currency, among other unpleasantries for the populace.  While he might think this to be a very nice idea for his bank and the US Government, we think not so nice for the rest of us.  But what is the problem really?  After all, the various pundits in the US Government and in various media seem to tell us things are looking up.  However, Bloomberg News asks (as part of the sub-heading in the article about the Buiter comments): Would this save the world economy?   Honestly, if you listen to some other economic commentaries, it would seem the world economy was already saved – or was it?

The existing real problem of too much debt, too much leverage and exponential use of unregulated (and uncollateralized) derivatives seems to be finally coming home to roost.   The new problem seems to be a lack of liquidity once again, and a lack of collateral – despite all of the QE programs, running of the printing presses (electronically of course) and other initiatives designed to starve off disaster.

Mr. Dave Kranzler from Investment Research Dynamics recently highlighted the unusual and exponential use of US Treasury Repo operations recently, leading him to conclude the US Federal Reserve is doing this to once again prop up the banks to coverage margin calls on derivatives (giving them Treasury securities to cover the additional margin).   Interesting enough, with regards to the individual investor, the IMF says that: Margin debt as a percentage of market capitalisation remains higher than it was during the late-1990s stock market bubble. The increasing use of margin debt is occurring in an environment of declining liquidity. 

Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, says the U.S. dollar’s rise won’t persist because the national economy is staggering and the Federal Reserve is going to delay, yet again, raising interest rates, which will then spark up inflation.  Mr. Schiff also goes on to say that: The US Fed has inflated the mother of all bubbles.

In short, we are hearing the same thing in general now in April 2015: Not enough Liquidity, Not enough Collateral.  Where did all that QE money go?  Stay tuned as the rest of this year could be a very rough ride indeed if these economic commentators are correct.

t3_358yhq,Fitch: Low Oil Prices Provide Marginal Benefit to Emerging Market Corporates,"
Fitch Ratings has published a special report entitled, 'Effect of Low Oil Prices on Emerging Market Corporates.' This report takes a look at the cash flow impact upon corporates of lower oil prices in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and South Africa. The impact is positive throughout Asia but neutral in Latin America. Throughout EMEA, the results are mixed.

Fitch believes Brazilian and Mexican corporates can expect no positive impact in terms of credit quality despite low oil prices.

'In Brazil, prices are highly regulated and have risen in U.S. dollar terms due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real. Fuel isn't a large part of the consumer's daily expenses, nor does it make up a large portion of the inflation basket,' said Joe Bormann, Managing Director and Deputy Regional Group Head of Fitch's Latin America Corporate group.

More than one out of every four Brazilian corporate issuers rated by Fitch has a Negative Rating Outlook or is on Rating Watch Negative. Consumer and producer confidence have fallen to levels not seen since 2009. Inflation continues to hover at around 8% despite multiple increases in interest rates.

'In Mexico prices also remain highly regulated, and lower international oil prices will not positively impact Mexican corporates' cash flow,' said Bormann. 'Fitch expects upgrades and downgrades to be evenly balanced during 2015 in Mexico despite no positive cash flow benefit from lower oil prices globally.'

Fuel prices in Brazil are established by Petrobras, which has the only refineries in Brazil and supplies in excess of 95% of the country's liquid fuel demand. In Mexico, energy reform will result in the liberalization of fuel prices by 2018, which will then result in local prices closely mirroring international prices. Until then, prices remain heavily regulated.

Oil prices jumped to their highest level this year, with Brent prices climbing to $67, up almost 50% from the lows in Dec 2014. The jump has raised concerns that inflation may accelerate in the coming months.

Fears that inflation will rebound strongly on higher oil prices may be overstated. Bond yields of some Asian countries have risen back to mid-2014 levels, even though oil prices are still some 40% lower from their 2014 highs.

The collapse in oil prices since mid-2014 has been largely favorable for Asia. Inflation has eased to an average of about 2% from over 3% in the first half of last year.

t3_35s9ni,Thinking of the labor pool as a natural resource raises interesting arguments about wages,"A thought experiment about wages and the working poor...

Consider our labor pool as one big resource: the available supply of human effort that can be applied to a commercial endeavor.

That resource is extremely valuable, and the state invests mightily to provide it to businesses - e.g., the entire public education system. Conversely, businesses rely on that resource by trading dollars for effort.

Of course, most natural resources erode if not maintained. The cost of chopping down a tree isn't just the loss of the tree - there's also accelerated soil erosion, reduced space for wildlife, deforestation, and climate change. Human labor is no different: as people work, they tend to age, incur health problems, occasionally get injured on the job, incur expenses (including work-related, e.g., transportation), etc.

Here's the upshot: Sub-living-wage employment takes a toll on the labor pool that businesses refuse to cover. Government makes up the difference in a dozen ways: all sorts of economic subsidies; lost employee tax revenue (both employee-side and employer-side); Medicaid (and health issues are exacerbated by the strain of long work hours and sustained financial pressure); worker's compensation; increased risk of personal bankruptcy; and years / decades of public assistance when these people can't work and have no retirement.

All of this cost is borne entirely by taxpayers. Business takes the resource that we invested to provide, fails to cover the direct costs of its use, and keeps the remainder as pure, untaxed profit.

In the end, the ""working poor"" problem, where people grind themselves down in honest labor and yet can't make a living, becomes our collective financial problem.

**tl;dnr** - The labor pool is a natural resource that government provides (via public education) and that businesses consume. When businesses don't pay for its upkeep, that natural resource erodes (poor health rates, poor literacy, poverty, crime, drug addiction), and society pays the difference.",9,0.85,1431483013.0
t3_361y2r,Whether Grexit is possible and its impact on the EU. Any insight welcome.,"Hi, 
As you may know that discussion of Grexit is just something on-going for a while now, same as everything is debatable, I wonder what your view on Grexit and such impact on EU?

My perspective is that provided that an exit is practically possible. Greece will exit. Exchange rate will adjust after a period of pain, but it would eventually recover (maybe ?). 

However, the image of EU which was once thought ""no exit"" union is undermined. How fair is it to some countries with compliance under the commission like Ireland and italy to name but a few. So, once Greece left and other subsequent requests to exit could be anticipated. It's the role of the trio to prevent such chain event from happening, so they would do their utmost to negotiate with Greece. Given Greece as news reported that the finance minister Yanis is a game theorist, (like it or not but this is on the headline) the best they could do is to pretend not cooperating until the best terms are offered.

Things up to the above line suggests a scenario where Greece merely want a better term. On contrary, German is impatient ( as suggested recently, but still on the headline, maybe media trick I don't know), implying perhaps they have enough and determining to end the deal, pushing Greece to finish the negotiation. 

I draw the conclusion that a Grexit is possible since Greece still has not agreed on the deal and German are impatient. From a flawed economics term, at least the Greek politician believes that staying in EU is worse than leaving it. i.e. the terms are not favorable enough. While German intend to terminate the deal as  soon as possible. (as Greek debts may continue to grow if they do not comply. And that as the driver of EU economy, German are essentially subsiding Greece) The situation would be that Greece leaves and EU suffer a detrimental impact on sovereign risks on bonds(of course a variety of things but effect on bonds are probably the most immediate), in the worst case resulting in the break up of EU as members are unwilling to underwrite the debts of others.    

Feel free to comment on my logic as well as any insights. It seems to me it is an asymmetric problem where German has the whole EU to worry about, while they obviously cannot leave instantaneously (Would you not blame the German if they hold a referendum tomorrow and exit EU?) in order to prevent the spillover effect of Grexit. On the other hand, Greece is only merely weighting what can bring them a better deal; exit or stay. Apparently, exiting is unprecedented and no one can estimate such impact on an economy. There is well-proved track records of recoveries in history through serious devaluation which is only made possible given the exit. 

Thank you for your time in reading my lengthy posts. :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as an additional thought, I put it here just not to confuse with the above. Timing of German being impatient (roughly) coincide with potential bond crisis (collapse) discussion in media only a few days ago. Reasoning behind is that bond prices are artificially inflated by ECB. If the market starts to think the impact of Greece leaving and the grim outlook of EU. I would expect bonds prices to go up as higher risk premium are required, a potential greater problem for the Trio and everyone within the EU.

All one needs to do is search on ""Glass-Steagall"" AND ""GATS"" 

""General Agreement on Trade in Services"" = WTO-GATS)

The following text is from Public Citizen's fact sheet [""Trade Agreements Cannot be Allowed to Undermine Financial Reregulation""](https://www.citizen.org/documents/FinanceReregulationFactSheetFINAL.pdf)

Starting in the late 1970s, the U.S. government and corporations pushed to redefine “finance” from a service that supports the real economy to a tradable commodity whose flow across borders should be uninhibited. Starting in the late 1980s , they successfully pushed for financial services to be included in “ trade ” negotiations, including those establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO). “The sector was truly unique in that respect, and there is little doubt within the trade policy community that financial sector support in the European Union and the United States was a determining force in concluding the FSA [WTO Financial Services Agreement],” notes a study posted on the WTO’s own website.

 The WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the financial service chapters of U.S. “ Free Trade ” Agreements (FTA s) limit the regulation of financial service sectors subject to these agreements. 

The United States bound most banking and securities services to comply with these rules and made sizeable commitments in insurance. The “trade” pact rules simply ban many common forms of financial regulation, even if such policies apply to domestic and foreign firms equally. 

U.S. government and corporate efforts in trade negotiations complemented domestic lobbying to weaken and eventually repeal the New Deal’s system of banking regulation. For instance, the Glass-Steagall Act created a firewall between commercial and investment banks to prevent the former from speculating with consumers’ savings. 

But the 1997 U.S. WTO commitments noted an intent to change Glass-Steagall to conform with WTO rules. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which did so, passed in 1999 – the year the WTO’s Financial Services Agreement (FSA) took effect. Many people still assume “trade” pacts are about traditional matters, such as tariff cuts. In fact, the WTO, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other U.S. FTAs require signatories – including the United States – to conform domestic policies to a broad non-trade deregulatory agenda. 

Few in Congress read the legislation implementing the WTO in 1994 or NAFTA in 1993, much less the pacts’ actual 900-page texts. Congress didn’t even get a vote on the expanded U.S. financial service deregulation commitments contained in the subsequent WTO FSA. But if any country’s laws fail to comply with WTO , NAFTA or FTA rules , the laws can be challenged before foreign tribunals, and the country can be subjected to indefinite trade sanctions until its laws meet “trade” pact dictates. 

While Congress has worked to reregulate banks and other financial firms since the crisis, it must also confront “trade” agreement rules that conflict with those reforms and require domestic law to conform to the now-rejected model of extreme deregulation that caused the global economic crisis.

And the point to be made is that there are a number of financial activities that are either regulated by different authorities, all depending upon the activity or depending upon the corporate structure involved (banks versus say hedge funds), or in some cases perhaps almost not at all.  And of course in recent years the growth of OTC (over the counter) derivatives trading and swaps have ballooned (both in volume and bubble like proportions).  However, it was a former head of the US Federal Reserve Bank that testified to the US Congress that banks are sophisticated financial institutions that need not be interfered with (our words and not the actual testimony, but you get the picture).  But of course if that is the case, then why have they been bailed out with tax-payer money?  The past 2008 financial crisis involved over zealous and sloppy lending standards by the financial institutions as it related to real estate loans, but the next crisis may very well involve derivatives, swaps or both.  If they knew what they were doing with mortgages and mortgage backed securities, and were bailed out when they had gotten into trouble, what makes anyone think this scenario would not be repeated with a possible derivatives problem?  Unless of course they have no intention of getting any funds from the government run deposit insurance or the tax-payers next time and intend to grab it from some place else. 

Despite the positive intentions of the 2010 US Dodd-Frank legislation (which addresses OTC derivatives trading among other things) we find it very interesting that a November 16, 2014 G-20 meeting resulted in what Mr. Martin Armstrong calls the case of government walking away from its promises (to protect bank account holders).  Mr. John Lawrence, writing an article dated January 6, 2015 titled: The Bail-In: How You and Your Money Will Be Parted During the Next Banking Crisis (San Diego Free Press) says it quite well:

When you deposit money in a checking or savings account, that money no longer belongs to you. Technically and legally, it becomes the property of the bank, and the bank just issues you what amounts to an IOU. As far as the bank is concerned, it’s an unsecured debt.  The way Dodd-Frank has managed to screw things around, derivatives (bets banks have made in the Wall Street casino) have priority over your checking and savings accounts when it comes to paying off their debts. And don’t think that the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) will save your money. The assets of the FDIC are minuscule (in the billions) compared to the valuation of outstanding derivatives (in the trillions). Your deposits are protected only up to the $250,000 insurance limit, and also only to the extent that the FDIC has the money to cover deposit claims or can come up with it.  Ellen Brown asks: What happens when Bank of America or JPMorganChase, which have commingled their massive derivatives casinos with their depositary arms, is propelled into bankruptcy by a major derivatives fiasco?  So, shadow banking, alien invasion or whatever (whomever) that may be called to blame for another financial crisis, it seems the average bank account holder could be at risk.

He started explaining to me what he does for a living and it got my wheels spinning. He lives in the United States but exports materials to a Latin American country where the currency is regulated by the government. Based on the way he explained it to me, I understand that he will purchase materials in the United States and export them to Country X. Because he is exporting from the United States, he is paid by businesses from Country X in USD. The curious aspect of this for me is that outside of Country X, their currency is almost worthless while internally, the currency still has some 'aritificial' value as their government regulates prices and exchange rates.

I'm trying to think through this before jumping to any conclusions, but my initial thoughts were that this seems a bit unethical. If the businesses in Country X are allowed to exchange their currency for USD at a more favorable rate, then wouldn't this end up hurting the economy/banking system within Country X? They are in essence absorbing the loss between the internal FX difference against the actual real world FX difference.

Am I understanding this correctly? Is this commonplace in countries where there is no free market? Is this considered unethical? I am not looking to 'whistleblow' (as I don't even think this is illegal) or even confront this person with this but I just wanted to make sure I understand correctly.

t3_37u22o,Dominican Republic Tourism Official Outlines Country's Rapid Visitor Growth,"Dominican Republic Update: The Economy Is Doing OK

Tourism is no longer the top economic component in the Dominican Republic (banking, telecommunications and construction are the top three), but it is still one of the top five sectors, and tourism is up.  According to this particular article, tourism is already up over 5 percent in 2015 year over year looking at the statistics from 2014 and there has been a 30 percent increase over the past 5 years.  New construction is still apparent in Santo Domingo especially and three new hotels have indeed opened in 2014 as the article indicates.  In addition, the Dominican economy is poised to yet again return positive GDP growth in 2015 of about 4 to 5 percent, as has been the case for the past 10 years.  Granted, this is a reduction of the 1996 to 2000 period when GDP was growing at 9 percent, but at least it is still turning in positive numbers which is not bad all things considered with the global economy.

In fact this has been a problem with the unemployed from Spain, Italy, Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela and some other countries coming into the Dominican Republic entering as tourists but with the intend of finding work.  For this reason the Dominican government has taken a stricter approach towards immigration issues.  However, the various categories of investors are certainly quite welcome, and this includes the retired or pensioners as well (which fall under the investor or self sufficient income category).

t3_38wfrm,Ben Bernanke Says Fed Can’t Get Caught Up in Inequality Debate,"Former US Federal Reserve Bank Chairman and Princeton Economics Professor Ben Shalom Bernanke says that the Fed cannot get caught up in the wealth inequality debate?  Considering it was the US Federal Reserve Bank that aided such increased inequality by it's various policies to bail-out and assist the insolvent US Financial institutions, this is a very interesting commentary indeed.  Sort of like a pyromaniac refusing to discuss the aftermath of an abandoned warehouse fire.  Although in the case of the Fed, real people were involved.

Mr. Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute opines that: While the Fed drove up stock prices, most of which are owned by the wealthy, it also increased the value of housing, which is mostly owned by the middle class (end of quote).

So, in short, these central bank rescues of the financial sector indirectly benefited owners of real estate and equities, which tend to be assets more likely to be owned by the somewhat more affluent.  So, while it was Central Bank and the politicians that have increased the current wealth inequalities we are now seeing, such is an inconvenient truth.  You are not going to find any politician or central banker apologizing to the general public for what they have done (no one in their right mind wants to be voluntarily tarred and feathered).  Remember, it was the banks and other financial institutions that were to be rescued, the general economy and everyone else be damned.  

Helicopter Ben himself has publicly said: The (uncertain) distributional impact of monetary policy should not prevent the Fed from pursuing its mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability, thereby providing broad benefits to the economy. The impact on inequality was beside the point.  And if there is a negative impact, it should be offset by fiscal policy.

t3_39l4bi,"How a lesser known trade deal currently pending could morph into a massive source of job loss similar to the H1B abuse currently in the media - hurting many US public and private sector employees, and reducing the ability of American workers to be promoted.","Basically, the problem is buried in the already existing WTO services agreement's endorsement of cross border trade in services, and its use of a special via, the L1 visa, to allow foreign corporations to move their skilled service employees across borders as needed to work for short periods of time. (up to several years) Its expected that under the plurilateral trade in services agreement this trade would increase substantially as it would accelerate the (quite controversial) mandated privatization of public sector workplaces begun in GATS.

[GATS Article I:3](http://www.iatp.org/files/GATS_and_Public_Service_Systems.htm) only exempts a very few government services. It reads as follows.  

""For the purposes of this Agreement…

(b) 'services' includes any service in any sector except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority;

(c) 'a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority' means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers."" 

----- Most current government services fail the second part of the test and will have to be privatized.   A great many contracts - perhaps including many or even most teaching jobs in countries that do not have collective bargaining laws which require mandatory union participation, or include explicit carve outs now, before the [Geneva negotiations](http://www.cuts-geneva.org/pacteac/images/Documents/EAC%20Forum/Forum17/EAC%20Geneva%20Forum-%20WTO%20Note%2017.pdf) move to the next step, may perhaps not so gradually, be required to be put up for international competitive bidding.  TISA is also supposed to become part of the WTO GATS in the near future. Which would require the use of a WTO compatible procurement system, such as the one which already exists which a number of US states procurement is already using. (as of April 6) 

Perhaps there is no need for a system similar to the WTO GPA system, perhaps it will just use that system. 

In theory the US opposes this, but I suspect from the push on H1B visas (full of corporate lobbying for more low wage workers - despite a very great need for jobs here- ) 

I suspect that this resistance is largely for appearances, and in practical terms the desire of the US trade negotiators to get more ""water"" (leverage) at the bargaining table, as well as a desire to improve the US balance of payments situation. (""Mode Four"" as the cross border ""Movement of Natural Persons"" for trade is called, is a ""balancing factor"") deals from countries like India on Rx drugs elsewhere, may result in the US making concessions in this area fairly quickly. 

For example, without those huge number of public sector jobs on the table, in the form of Mode Four concessions, the US might not have the clout it would need to meet a major goal of US trade policy, reducing global access to low cost generic drugs. This might be done by opening factories in India ""to cooperate with"" Indian drug companies via GATS.)

t3_39ph8a,Breaking free of debt slavery,"I am in debt, and that is a result of decisions I have made in the past. There is a two sided relationship between the lender and borrower. Some of my past decisions that brought me into debt have been irrational and others have been acts of desperation to support my family.

There is a viscous cycle where, as I enter into higher debt, I spend more money servicing debt. Also, the further in debt I am, the higher risk I am to the lender, so when cycling debt I am forced into higher interest. I understand the rational.

My question is about the legal framework between borrower and lender, and whether government could frame this better to help people get out of debt slavery.

1. I suggest any debt that is secured by an asset can be exited by simply passing ownership of that asset to the lender. The borrower cannot be pursued for money owing above and beyond value of asset.

2. There be placed a cap on the interest rate allowed for unsecured loans. Basically an unsecured loan is still secured to an individual. At no point is it rational for an individual to take on high interest debt, except in the case of an investment, in which case there will be a securable asset and the rule does not apply.

I would like to remove the incentive from lenders to bring people into debt slavery. If lenders ability to extract money from borrowers is limited, they will have less incentive to sell bad life decisions to people.

I think the reason is, we were never told about a previous FTA, which began these changes, so we dont realize we're 20 years into them. We don't realize than in order to get back to where most of us think we are now, we not only have to prevent the new ones, we also have to extricate ourselves from the previous one. Or, we're going to be trapped in a global race to the bottom that will remake the world for the very wealthy to the detriment of everybody else. Its not enough for them that inequality remain where it is, in order to prevent positive change, they clearly feel they need to attack everything we hold dear, not just here, around the world. 

What needs to happen is *we need to figure out other, more positive models for globalization, and reject their WTO and ""investor rights trump all"" model. The people of the world need to put their heads together WITH business interests and figure out a win win plan for everybody. Not just mega corporations. Everybody. And this isnt it. 

Because THIS (TPA-initiated-chain of events will happen on autopilot)- system absolutely cannot do anything good.  Its expresly designed NOT TO INTENTIONALLY, because if it did, then THAT would impede profits.  if you cannot sell the drug or the water to the highest bidder only, that impedes profits, doesnt it? **If you have to hire the local because he's the person who knows how to do the job and hes here, intead of forcing him to train his replacement,  that reduces profits.**

 See the problem?  Do the TPA, TAA, TISA, TPP, TTIP, WTO - it all must be rejected this week and every week until its gone. 

Just as CAFTA completely ignored human rights once enacted, TPP, TISA and TTIP are thoroughly anti-human rights, and TPA and TAA, being NATIONAL laws, are irrelevant to the FTAS. There is another way they are lying. They cannot tell us the truth which is the FTAs go above them and make them powerless, so they have focused on TPA which we should think of as a placebo button that simply starts a process that cannot be stopped which goes on autompilot and the rest is totally irrelevant and is only there to keep the people barking up the wrong tree for a year or three or four while the power to change things without doing the impossible, upsetting this whole system, which could not be done. Because its out of our hands once its created. the only time we can stop it is now, while the vote still exists in the people's hands. That is why the vote tomorrow or Tuesday. is SO IMPORTANT. 

Let me show you how much they are lying. 

[In this paper you can see how TISA is intended to serve as a laboratory](http://www.wti.org/fileadmin/user_upload/wti.org/institute/pdfs/S1793993314400067.pdf) for global services liberalisation.  Liberalisation means privatization and then globalization. That is the #1 goal. Making sure that firms, nomatter where they are from, who do basically everything, 70% of all jobs are services, ""everything you cannot drop on your foot"" - the priority will be getting the most work for the least money (i.e. living wage and sustainability ARE NOT ON THE MAPS AT ALL) And all ""discrimination"" that is relevant once this change occurrs, is discrimination against corporations by country. What that means is that an appropriate percentage of jobs MUST go to foreign firms or the WTO will step in and start eliminating rules which are perceived as standing in the way. 

Google phrases like ""WTO"" and ""Necessity Tests"" and ""No more burdensome than necessary"" to see what I mean.  You'll see that professional licensing requirements as well as citizenship or residence requirements will soon be difficult to defend at best and forbidden at worse in contexts where they have always been the norm. Why? because they block foreign firms who will suddenly become ***legally entitled*** to do the work IF they win it by their **""competitive advantage""**, low cost. 

Things like minimum wages, will be under attack. That is, if they even apply (Since the firms will be foreign and their workers presence here ""temporary"" - less than a few years in any single case, it is possible that they may not, they currently may not with L1 visas based on GATS, it seems. 

In any case, it seems almost no Americans understand this important shift of frame or its implications.)   In the world at large, there has been little in the way of progress on human rights since the WTO was brought into being and it could be argued we've actually gone backwards. SO DONT EXPECT THINGS TO GET BETTER, ENDORSING THIS SYSTEM IS GUARANTEED TO MAKE THINGS WORSE. 

How it is intended to transition huge chunks of the economy into WTO control. What this means is that schools and colleges health care payment (insurance) and health care, and and banking and water and public works and literally everything currently done by the governments FFORDABLY will be forced to be MONETIZED and in that context it will become affordable and in the process in the quest for affordability the fix will be crap-ification inside of GPA. All those government jobs and a lot of non-government contracts will be required to use the WTO's [General procurement Agreement](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gpa_1994_e.htm) in selecting contractors. 

The winning bid will be the lowest bid. 

**Also, any kinds of local discrimination (for example, selecting women owned or minority firms or preferring local firms, is only allowed in poor countries, rich countries have to just take the winning bids.)**  See Technical Barriers to Trade web page. And READ EVERY WORD CRITICALLY because a lot of change can be contained in a few innocuous looking words **YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR TRADE LINGO, YOU HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT THERE, NO WORDS MEAN WHAT THEY SEEM TO MEAN.**

**I cannot over emphasize this- the legal standard is that NO law or regulation can be allowed that has the effect of inhibiting trade, - the legal standard is  ""no more burdensome than necessary""**  

***That means this shift will literally turn our world upside down.***

Also, get those frames where you expect jobs to go to Americans out of your mind, they likely wont. After all, we have to charge more. Because of our costs of living. 

**The winning bids will come from the countries with the most favorable regulatory environment, meaning in many cases, the lowest wages. They will do work here. Millions of jobs will go to them. this is their payoff for globalization.**

Now we have a return to the Washington Consensus. its a shame its about screwing the country.

>*""So Mr. Obama has now turned his focus to House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to find a legislative strategy that would preserve trade promotion authority, which would give the president accelerated power to negotiate the broader Trans-Pacific Partnership accord with 11 other nations from Japan to Chile.""*

>*“The speaker and I have spoken with the president about the way forward on trade,” Mr. McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s still my hope that we can achieve what we’ve set out to achieve together, which is to get a six-year trade promotion authority bill in place that will advantage the next occupant of the White House as well as this one. And obviously there was a malfunction over in the House on Friday that we all watched with great interest, and we are not giving up.”*

>*""After the Senate had passed the trade measure, the House took it up but could not get it to the president’s desk last week as Democrats voted against a component of the package known as trade adjustment assistance that provides relief for workers displaced by global trade pacts. Democrats have long supported such programs, but last Friday voted against it as a way of undermining the president’s push for accelerated negotiating authority.""*",38,0.95,1434597205.0

t3_3axozc,Satisfying Calls for a Minimum Wage Increase with a Labor Market,"I've been wondering for a few years now if calls for increasing the minimum wage might be able to be satisfied using market methods:

It is often said that the minimum wage, as it is, is appropriate for unskilled, entry level labor. Calls for a minimum wage increase aren't coming from the unskilled entry-level, however. It is people who have years of experience and have accumulated skills that they can not figure out how to better monetize that are asking for relief.

The underlying problem, I think, is information. For the laborer there is no understanding of what his/her skills are truly worth, where they can be applied, what skill gaps he/she needs to cover, and whether the return in increased wages justifies the cost. Employers also often aren't quite sure of what they are looking for or what is a fair wage. 

I wonder if the solution to this information problem might be a structure not unlike a commodities market: a group of brokers agree to do business within the exchange. The brokers develop labor descriptions including required qualifications and length of service. Prospective laborers submit proof of qualification (possibly with certification services provided through the broker, or a third party) and agree to provide service for the time period(s) he/she is selling. Prospective employers make a buy order for service through a broker who matches the order to sell orders by other brokers within the group. Default risk (employee not showing up, failing to be qualified as stated, on the job injury, or employer backing out) is borne by insurers who insure both parties; and the broker (or a third party clearing house) could offer substitution to prevent default. Daily trade volume and price information is published in the newspaper, where other prospective laborers learn what skills are in demand (due to volume), and what those skills are worth. Prospective employers likewise learn the same. 

I think this might be a good, market based way of solving the problem. What do other folks think?",2,0.67,1435139107.0
t3_3awn5r,"If the US is a ""captured state"" as I have recently been hearing people theorize, who are the captors of the captured state? (definitions in post body)","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capture

State capture is a type of systemic political corruption in which private interests significantly influence a state's decision-making processes to their own advantage through illicit and unobvious channels. The influence may be through a range of state institutions, including the legislature, executive, ministries and the judiciary. It is thus similar to [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) but differs through the wider variety of bodies through which it may be exercised and because, unlike regulatory capture, the influence is never overt.

Another distinguishing factor from corruption is while in case of corruption the outcome (of policy or regulatory decision) is not certain, in case of captured state the outcome of the decision is known and is to very high probability to be beneficial for captors of the state. Also in case of corruption (even rampant) there is plurality and competition of 'corruptors' to influence the outcome of the policy or distribution of resources. In case of captured state, those deciding are usually more in a position of agents to the principals (captors) who function either in monopolistic or oligopolistic (non-competitive) fashion.",10,0.81,1435113033.0

edit: I realize wind infrastructure needs to be built so there's a high upfront cost, while fossil fuel plants already exist, but new fossil fuel plants are built often. Shouldn't new construction be leaning towards wind?

**Here's some sources about the price of wind compared to fossil fuel power:**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The Upcycle, page 104:**

Since the 1980s, the cost per kilowatt-hour of wind has dropped 80 percent; it is approximately 2-cents cheaper per kWh than coal-powered electricity on the US market as of June 2012. 

(Original source: Mark Bolinger and Ryan Wiser, 2011 Wind Technologies Market Report (Oak Ridge, TN: US Department of Energy, 2012).) 

.

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-path-to-sustainable-energy-by-2030/

Today [2009], the cost of wind, geothermal and hydroelectric are all less than 7 cents a kilowatt-hour (kWh).... 
For comparison, the average cost in the US in 2007 of conventional power generation and transmission was about 7-cents/kWh.... Power from wind turbines, for example, already costs about the same or less than it does from a new coal or natural gas plant, and in the future wind power is expected to be the least costly of all options.

t3_3bf3es,"Pros and Cons of allowing professionals from different countries to work in other countries, without being tied to a specific corporation.","What do you think would happen if people with professional qualifications were allowed to work wherever they could find work, at whatever wage they could negotiate? Where their presence in a country was not tied to a specific (typically much lower than average wage) employer?

Note that a several treaties to allow ""professionals"" to work in other countries while tied to ONE corporation exist and are pending . Not being tied to a specific corporation would mean higher wages.

Considering the huge change that these ""labor mobility"" provisions could potentially create in society, its surprising that there has been so little questioning of these provisions. For example, tying workers to a specific corporation, likely to be huge corporations, creates a situation where the workers have no ability to negotiate on any level. Additionally, in the US, the current deals appear to utilize non-immigrant, treaty related visas that seem to have no requirement for prevailing or even minimum wages to be paid while the workers are working in the US. It appears there is no minimum wage requirement at all. Additionally, licensing requirements may be forced through a harmonization process that would seem to force a lowest common denominator approach. And where do the self employed and small state and one-nation companies fit into the picture. They don't, they seem to have no place in the current/pending systems.  Wages will also likely be so low in many of these jobs as to undercut existing wages in all of the developed countries involved. Potentially effecting millions of people. Some industries, like education, nursing, construction, computer services/IT, financial services, and perhaps energy, may be hit particularly hard. 

What I think these trade deals are are they are an attempt to mount a preemptive strike of all legal positions for the huge multinational corporations and to the detriment of the people of the world.

An alternative would be to liberalize cross border trade in services on the individual level, allowing free competition and wages to find their own level, based on skill level. 

This would be fairer and it would reduce the gross inequalities which will most certainly devastate society if the existing plans for a corporation-centric liberalization of services are realized. Nations will also then be prevented from using services jobs as bargaining chips to gain concessions. That is also a destructive situation because, for example, do we really want the US government trading public sector jobs to Indian IT firms to get the Indian pharmaceutical industry to stop producing inexpensive, off patent generic drugs that save a lot of lives? That may be what the US drug industry lobbyists are pushing for but its against the public interest of Americans just as much as it is of other countries.",4,0.75,1435512624.0

The story began when I was interested in buying some glasses from an online retailer based in the UK.  When I did a currency conversation less than a month ago, it was GBP232.50 -> NZD500~.  Which was ok, but unfortunately they didn't have any of the frames I wanted in stock.

So I check back a week later and it skyrocketed to NZD517~ so I decided to wait a little bit hoping the price would drop.  Big mistake.

It is now GBP232.50 -> NZD535.50. (29/06/15)

I have been keeping an eye on the GBP/NZD exchange rates for nearly a couple weeks and I'm growing curious as to what influences these rates.

I have little to no knowledge of Economics, but I watched a couple YT videos explaining exchange rates and understand the gist of supply and demand for different currencies but I am more interested in more concrete examples that influence the exchange rate of currencies and whether or not if there are current events that are causing this massive jump.

TL;DR What are some examples that influence exchange rates and is there any current events that may be affecting the largest spike in GBP vs NZD since 2009?

I have seen some comments/concerns that it could lead to a situation of 'who's next' but would this really be the case? There are a lot of people saying it would be a loose/loose but would that be the case? Is the EU trying to push Greece out discreetly?

As I understand it, the Greek government at the time of the country's entry to the EU pretty much lied and has been the somewhat a problem child for a while now, where as the likes of Ireland have made progress.

Would it be a good thing for the EU eventually if Greece did leave (Eg be rid of the most problematic country to focus on the others)? What would happen to the residual debt? If Greece gets the boot, could there be potential for the EU, in the future, to try and reclaim those debts (the 142 billion euros owed to the European Financial Stability Fund for example).

And finally, what would happen in Greece the day after? What could we expect to see in a year's time?

t3_3hw1yy,More stores closing??? Well of course!!! My letter to the retail world!,"This is my open letter to the retail world.
 
I see you failing, I see you’ve failed. Big box stores closing doors, mom and pop shops the same. Clothing stores I used to frequent closed and gone, malls where I’d spend my time and money dwindling. There’s now a for lease sign in the store window. Has been for months. I hear that spending is down, people don’t have as much money to spend as they used to. As a mid 30’s man I’ve always had some “extra” cash to spend. That’s why I was in your store! But you didn’t see that in me, instead your employees were quick to judge, quick to gauge, and very slow in providing any real service. Was it a privilege to shop at your store? Did my hundreds of dollars in cash not qualify at your store? Why was my money no good to you? You even hired security guards to further perpetuate your ignorant mindset. I walk into all of your stores and see the same discrimination. Walkers following me, security guards following me, staff following me with the lowest of intentions. Even when I’m with my 7 month old son! (the final straw). I sell cars. I KNOW the importance of first impression, first contact. It’s how I make my money. It’s why I’m writing this letter. I remember being a 13 year old and getting this treatment in the biggest of big stores and 20 years later and thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars spent at your stores and you treat me the same. Oh you’re closing??? Oh no one is shopping with you anymore??? Oh you’re out of work??? Hmmm. Makes sense doesn't it? No one judges me when I shop on Amazon. No one gives me attitude. Now for the remaining retail outlets that I do still support, I support because I WANT to. I spend the extra $$$ knowing I’m supporting a business that cares. Cares about me, about the staff, about the product. I will support the business that fights for my business, who wants me to spend there and who is respectful. Again… Why didn't you want my money? How pompous? You pepper me with e-mails about sales and discounts on a daily basis, you display sales signs, pump music, and do everything in your power to get me into your store… And then treat me like a second class citizen when I arrive. Well the jokes on you. I can never forgive you for your inability to serve the common man some of his most basic needs. The lack of training your employees to be empathetic, compassionate, and engaging has turned me to on-line shopping(something I’ve been against because I support local). But I cannot support your ignorance. You’ve lost touch with the modern man/woman and we’ve lost touch with you. Good luck in your bankruptcy, good luck with your lay offs, and for those of you on the front lines who judged me with your retail superiority, good luck with the job search, it was you who turned my money away!
 
$o $o $incerely,
 
A man who $pend$

This post might come off a bit ""ranty"" but I do have some honest questions. Here goes!

I am from Malaysia and we are known for awesome food, great beaches, a multicultural melting pot....MH370 and now now a very corrupt government, in the process of bankrupting my dear country.

Now, believe it or not, Malaysia has a lot to offer, but in the past 8 weeks, our Ringgit has dropped faster than a hot potato! This is due to a corruption scandal revolving our Prime Minister and a property developer company. We were trading at RM3.1 to 1 USD and now it is RM4.2 to 1 USD. That's madness if you ask me. It's even more frustrating that I am planning to make a trip to USA this year for my maiden voyage. Here are some of my questions regarding this grave matter:

1. How can the Malaysian economy sink so fast?
2. Is there any way I can profit from this situation?

I am a regular corporate guy, so I don't have much savings or come from a wealthy family. I hope my questions have not been too simple in nature.

But wouldn't it have been wiser to raise the interest rates roughly back in June to Oct 2014 when the market started to give glimmers of being in overvaluation territory? I see that in that time period, the S&P 500 CAPE was at around 25 (this is the only data that I have free access to). From what I've read, that's in the high limit of valuation. 

To me it doesn't make sense to flirt with raising the rates when the stocks are so close to correction territory. I realize that the Fed was looking for outward signs, for example, low unemployment rate. But don't you have to put the brakes on well before any outward signs such as that so that you can ease your way into a stable economy?

The Board of Directors of (the “Company”) passed resolutions to appoint a Transaction Committee to oversee the Company’s ongoing evaluation and planning of liquidity alternatives for interested shareholders, including without limitation, a possible ESOP transaction.  Jo will be managing the transaction process for the Committee. 

Due to the Board’s concern about a possible conflict of interest in evaluating and executing such a transaction, J and St have agreed to take a leave of absence from their day to day company roles until the Committee determines that the evaluation is complete or a transaction is completed.  J will continue to serve on the Board of Directors.

The Board has named S and K as the individuals to assume the duties and role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Company as co-Presidents and co-CEOs until such time that the evaluation is completed or a transaction is agreed upon by the interested shareholders.

If you have any projects that you were working directly with J or St on, please contact S or K for continued direction.

t3_3ko57x,What am I missing? Yellen's labor market dashboard is still behind on 6 out of 9 measures.,"I fully expect the Fed to raise rates next week though I'm puzzled by the seeming inevitability of the decision. The labor market dashboard that Yellen suggested was important in indicating when a hike would occur is still behind on 6 out of 9 measures. It's here:

http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-yellens-labor-market-dashboard/

Both actual inflation and inflation expectations remain anchored (in fact actual inflation is well below target of 2%). The dollar is already quite strong (particularly after the Chinese devaluation). Markets are volatile and EMs are in a world of hurt. Wages remain stubbornly stuck in neutral and have been for a very long time. There isn't even a hint of general wage increase pressure.

In this context I'm puzzled why the Fed would raise now when the risk of triggering a recession at this stage of the ""recovery"" is enormous. But the risk of inflation seems small and quite remote. In that context it is rational for people to flee the stock market and ""wait it out"" which, in and of itself, could help bring on slower growth or even a recession.

If they raise now they will be getting out in front of wage pressure that doesn't exist and inflation that doesn't exist. And they'll be doing it at a time when almost all of our trade partners are actively devaluing their currency.

To be clear I'm not arguing we should restart QE but it seems foolish to tighten when the US dollar is already so strong that it's damaging the competitiveness of American goods abroad. In particular it seems even more foolish to tighten when inflation and inflation expectations are anchored and the labor market is still behind on 6 out of the 9 measures that the Fed themselves said were important indicators of labor market health.",9,0.84,1442070802.0

That got me thinking about how this could possibly work in real life.  Say a currency was developed specifically to ""pay"" what would otherwise be unpaid volunteer positions.  I'm thinking that you get one coin for every hour you're putting in work, which in theory would tie the value of the coins to the federal minimum wage (if not more) for exchange purposes.  So it'd be a currency based on the value of the working hour as opposed to other factors such as cost of living.

Say some organization took it upon themselves to be the ones who produced and distributed these coins.  What are the barriers present that would prevent or impede acceptance of this currency in various stores across the U.S. (and worldwide)?

t3_3nj7g4,Why you should not worry about a US dollar collapse,"I recently published an in-depth analysis of the US dollar and its current situation to give people a broader perspective on the future of the world’s reserve currency.

Important highlights from the article on why the dollar will not collapse soon:

1. Japan will continue its experiment with the most radical quantitative easing attempted by a major country in the history of the world… and the experiment is getting dangerous. >> From all appearances, Japan’s leadership is fully prepared to push the yen much lower than it is now. That will help owners of dollars and dollar-denominated assets.

2. Europe is headed for a crisis at least as severe as the Grexit scare was in 2012—and for the resulting run-up in interest rates and a sovereign debt scare in the peripheral countries. >> As you might imagine, no one who owns euros is happy with this situation. Dollar interest rates may not be very high, but they are better than the euro alternative.

3. China is approaching its day of reckoning as it tries to reduce its dependency on debt in its bid for growth, while creating a consumer society. >> There is a strong chance China will experience either a hard landing or a long period of very slow growth. While we expect much volatility, China’s transition should be bullish for the dollar as the trade balance moves closer to equilibrium.

4. All of the above will tend to be bullish for the dollar, which will make dollar-denominated debt in emerging-market countries more difficult to pay back.

It's not simply theory that stands alone. Economic theory (from an empirical, judgemental perspective) is linked to all the firms who have people educated in the same theories and make decisions based upon them. For example...

Theory A: Event X --> Event Y

In other words, Theory A predicts Event Y will happen if event X happens. Everyone studies Theory A in school, including policymakers and people that run firms. Event X happens. Everyone reacts in anticipation of event Y, therefore event Y happens.

Surely somebody famous has made a theory or at least statement on this? If this is fallacious somehow, let me know.

t3_3qdfdu,The Time Elapsed Historical View On Our Consumption,"For many, many years before humans ever walked upon this planet, it was already growing a variety of plant and animal species.  The universe and creation of the Earth itself deposited the different metals and minerals we harvest from it.  Other metals and minerals are formed by the various natural systems the Earth goes through, such as the movement of the tectonic plates.  Or the forming of diamonds from coal being exposed to intense heat and pressure.

During this time, since no beings were really harvesting the various resources, the Earth began to form a stockpile of all of these things, including the various forms of life.  Over millions of years it formed these stockpiles, such as fossil fuels (oil / gas).

""Contrary to what many people believe, fossil fuels are not the remains of dead dinosaurs. In fact, most of the fossil fuels we find today were formed millions of years before the first dinosaurs.

Fossil fuels, however, were once alive!

They were formed from prehistoric plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago.

Think about what the Earth must have looked like 300 million years or so ago. The land masses we live on today were just forming. There were swamps and bogs everywhere. The climate was warmer. Ancient trees and plants grew everywhere. Strange looking animals walked on the land, and just as weird looking fish swam in the rivers and seas. Tiny one-celled organisms called protoplankton floated in the ocean.

When these ancient living things died, they decomposed and became buried under layers and layers of mud, rock, and sand. Eventually, hundreds and sometimes thousands of feet of earth covered them. In some areas, the decomposing materials were covered by ancient seas, then the seas dried up and receded.

During the millions of years that passed, the dead plants and animals slowly decomposed into organic materials and formed fossil fuels. Different types of fossil fuels were formed depending on what combination of animal and plant debris was present, how long the material was buried, and what conditions of temperature and pressure existed when they were decomposing.

For example, oil and natural gas were created from organisms that lived in the water and were buried under ocean or river sediments. Long after the great prehistoric seas and rivers vanished, heat, pressure and bacteria combined to compress and ""cook"" the organic material under layers of silt. In most areas, a thick liquid called oil formed first, but in deeper, hot regions underground, the cooking process continued until natural gas was formed. Over time, some of this oil and natural gas began working its way upward through the earth's crust until they ran into rock formations called ""caprocks"" that are dense enough to prevent them from seeping to the surface. It is from under these caprocks that most oil and natural gas is produced today.""

We can view this natural supply as a savings account, that our mother (Mother Nature) had set up for us before we were ever born. And over the years, it grew and grew. Then humans came into the picture and we eventually started to harvest the different resources. We hunted the different animals for food and clothing, along with other various body parts for materials to build tools. We gathered plants for food and material for various tools and structures. At first, like most other species, our numbers and cumulative harvesting habits were in a small enough amount that the natural functions of the planet could keep pace.

It would be akin to us making withdrawals from the ""savings account""; as long as they were small enough amounts spaced out, the interest rate would keep up so we did not start having a negative growth rate and possibly even keep a positive growth rate if they were small enough. So it seemed we could never run out. But then we learned different techniques to increase our harvesting rate, and our numbers grew so even more people were harvesting at ever faster and faster rates. Then came the Industrial Revolution which exponentially increased our speed of harvesting, all the meanwhile our species grew in number. And now we are in the automation age, along with being funneled into a Consumerist and Disposable Goods lifestyle / behavior patterns.

""For most of human history man has been a hunter and gatherer; although his use of fire, and local over-population, may have altered the environment, the consequences of his actions were small compared with those of farmers. Plants and animals were first domesticated some 12-10000 years ago, and sedentary agriculture slowly became established in most parts of the world."" David Grigg; The Industrial Revolution and Land Transformation; Chap 4, Intro

http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_32/SCOPE_32_1.4_Chapter4_79-109.pdf

Quite a while ago, we started dipping into that savings account of resources Mother Nature had set up, to the point in which we are outpacing the ""interest rate"" so we effectively have a negative growth rate.

Another analogy I have used in the past incorporates that old idea of endless wells that so many used to see our supply of resources as. They have never been endless wells (with a few exceptions such as wind and hydroelectric power); they have always been more akin to wells that refill slowly over time. And we are taking from the well faster than it can replenish itself. And some of these wells can not replenish at all if they are totally emptied, such as an animal species. If we get the population so low, that species eventually goes extinct. And once it is extinct, we can not get it back.

But to consistently grow a metric known as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) we must continue this pattern. To keep the masses enthralled and distracted, we must continue this pattern. To keep a small elite group in power over the rest of humanity, we must continue this pattern.

We can see where this pattern leads to, so do we want to continue this pattern?

We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

Here in America, are we living up to the idea of securing the ""Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"" if we let ourselves run out of resources and don't leave any for future Americans? Do we even secure our own Liberty if we allow economic models that allow small private groups to take full control (privatize) of various resources?

From the same documentary, Professor Noam Chomsky states:

""“Human beings are complex creatures. I mean for example, we are capable right now, at this minute, of acting, in such a way as too, make it likely if not certain that our grandchildren are going to face terrible disasters. And we are consciously acting too accelerate that likelihood even though we all love our grandchildren. How can you be more contradictory then that?”

These are the problems faced when dealing with any Consumerist Based Economic Model, which includes Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, or any hybrid variation of said models.

""  ""sustainable development."" In the past, the mainstream theories and models of development hardly addressed the critical environmental and ecological issues. For instance, development theories within the conservative tradition, including various economic growth theories and modernization theories, are predominantly concerned with how to enchance economikc growth and accumulation, efficient production and allocation, political stability and order, and entrepreneurial culture and personality, but they are often indifferent towards the environmental costs of economioc production and accumulation. Similarly, the tradition of radical development theories, including classical Marxist and neo-Marxist theories (except Marzian environmentalists such as M.R. Redclift, James O'Connor, and Barry Commoner), tends to deal with variou modes of production, production relations, and class structures whikle overlooking the question of environmental disorders and ecological damages caused by capitalist production of environmental disorders and ecological damages caused by capitalist produciton and industrial expansion. Radical dependency theories explain the existing world capitalist system based on unequal exchange and center-periphery dependency as the main cause of underdevelopment, but they hardly deal with intergenerational dependency and underdevelopment cause by environmental challenges such as depletion of nonrenewable resources and decline of biodiversity. In short, the major theories and models of development articulated under the conservative-capitalist and radical-socialist perspectives, have a common drawback in their relative indifference toward the implications of environmental issues for human development.""

From the Capital Institute, a non-partisan American Think Tank:

""There are three major crises in the world that must be resolved fairly soon:

*Economic activities in the fossil fuel-based global market system have exceeded the limits of a safe operating space for humanity of three planetary boundaries: climate change, the nitrogen cycle, and biodiversity loss.

*The uneven distribution of economic output, wealth, inocme, and scarce planetary developed countries and those living in conditions of extremem poverty in underdeveloped and developing countries.

*An unstable global financial system continues to operate largely in the absence of the oversight and regulation that could prevent another meltdown in this system like that which occurred in December 2008.

The business-as-usual approach to dealing with these crises is predicated on the assumption that they can be resolved by identifying and eliminating the linear connections between ""root"" causes and their effects. What those who take approach have apparently failed to realize is that the systems associated with the crises are not seperate and distinct. They are embedded in and interactive with one another in a global market system in which causes are consequences and consequences are causes.""

And here we have Professor Joseph Stiglitz and Professor Herman Daly, both former World Bank Economist, speaking about how there are problems with the ""Market"" model and it being unsustainable.

http://www.tubechop.com/watch/6310433

Many people have spoken on this same subject, including myself on numerous occasions.  We have presented the same information in numerous ways to reach the people and try to get them to break through the illusion and lies of the past.

No form of market economy, or consumerist based economic model tinkering will fix the problem.  We need true fundamental change.  Our savings account is running dry, and all the litter we have created by using up that savings account is trashing our home, and we have no place to throw all that trash besides our own yard.

And all of this leads into the social ills we see today by applying different forms of stress onto the populace which lead them into actions of desperation to try to survive and blow off steam.

Let us make the change, not only for ourselves, but for our Posterity as well.

Anti-tipping is anti-recognition of both the skill and effort of others.  It's denying that anyone can do a job better than any other.  It's one expecting their job to decide their pay, disregarding efficacy.  

And perhaps this is normal, but do we shop at places according to their equality, or do we favor those who provide as the most benefit for the least cost.

Recently there has been a lot of discussion about the shrinking middle class and worsening wealth inequality in developed countries. Someone implied that ""middle class"" is a relatively recent concept, existing only after WW2, and that it's existence might be a blip in history. This made me think..

It may be just my simple linear engineer mind talking, but those problems happening not only make sense but it is unavoidable, given current global population growth.

I couldn't find this calculated anywhere and didn't try to do it myself, but if everyone on earth had the same income, I'm pretty sure it would not be what we call middle class today (owning a house, eating out, spending money on leisure and entertainment) ... but significantly less.

I know economy is not a zero sum game, but... if poverty levels are decreasing all the time, resources are being drained and earth population keeps growing, what exactly are we demanding / expecting?

Is it even possible to end world poverty, keep raising standards in ""third world countries"" and still keep the high middle class standards we are used to?

2. Should I even bother with marijuana stocks and just invest in Marlboro, etc, since they will (correct me if I'm wrong) have such a head start in terms of available capital?

I wonder how an annual inflation of (on average) 3% can hold continuously, the way it has done in the past.

That doesn't mean there is $541 million more money circulating today than there was yesterday, though, because 95% of the notes printed each year are used to replace notes already in circulation."" 5% of 541 million is roughly 25 million, or $9 billion per year in new money. I assume that part of the price increase can be attributed to this new money, but 9 bilion still seems like a very low number. So where does this 3% come from and how can it uphold seemingly forever? If prices increase at a rate faster than money, surely that should eventually cause problems somewhere? Or if GDP grows at the same rate, where does this come from? Is it like cannibalization, where this growth can only happen if other countries' growth is hindered?

See http://www.eua.be/Libraries/Publication/EUA_Statement_TTIP.sflb.ashx

They create a new means of corporate intra company work, by mandating that countries grant unlimited numbers of ""non-immigrant"" trade related visas without any ""necessity tests"" or ""economic means tests"" and licensing requirements and any other law or policy that is inconsistent with the goal of increasing trade will have to be conformed to it, including laws like wage laws which are seen as carved in stone. So the use of these non-immigrant labour mobility provisions is likely to be a big payoff for the labour providing less developed countries, and indigenous workers in developed countries are likely to see losses as their jobs are privatized and globalized. The non-immigrant visas must be granted- are likely to skyrocket and the workers thus made available may be very cheap. There may be no rules requiring their international corporate employers to pay them any more than they are paid by mutual agreement. Local wage laws such as those in US and in states and municipalities may end up being pressured into elimination due to their preventing local companies from competing for the newly privatized jobs in their local workers former workplaces, now privatized. And it can all be blamed on the WTO.

The 51 nation plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (now being negotiated in Geneva) and the long stalled WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (which it may be merged into in the near future) are the ones to watch in the critical services area. A recent summary of the TiSA negotiations published by an East African group leads me to believe that the US position is one which may not be popular, due to its costs and likelihood to require workers being given raises simply because they are temporarily in the US, while their firms see their low wages as a principal reason they are likely to win bids for future service contracts under the ""progressive liberalisation"" scheme, which will force large portions of the public sector in signatory nations to privatize and globalize, using the revised WTO Government Procurement Agreement's (revised ""GPA"") e-tendering system. The lowest qualified bidder will have a legal right to perform the work with their own staffs. They will not have to hire local workers as that would be ""more burdensome than necessary""

They are running out of reserves and even though they could stop the bleeding by cutting oil production, they don't want to do that until they've bankrupted most of their competitors. So if oil stays cheap and they run out of reserves and let the Riyal float, what happens?

Several things come to mind:

- A weaker Riyal would mean the Saudis could keep selling oil for cheap, without running out of reserves so fast. Because they would still be getting paid in Dollars.

- But that brings me to the next point, which is the Dollar is highly dependent on its role in the oil markets. Oil is priced in Dollars around the world. The Saudis are the biggest producer. The Riyal/Dollar peg helps stabilize prices. If they delink the Riyal from the Dollar, it will affect price stability. The price goes up and down, but it's still relatively more stable and more controllable when it's priced in Dollars than being priced in multiple currencies. 

- If there's no peg, the Saudis wouldn't require Dollars to maintain the peg. So they might exchange the Dollars for something else. Or they might sell oil in other currencies. 

- if the Saudis don't need as many Dollars, what do they do with them? What do other countries do when a floating Riyal increases volatility in the oil market?

- Say they keep the peg, but they devalue. The price of oil finds a new equilibrium lower than it would have been. So they get some time to bankrupt more competitors. Nothing else really changes, or does it? ",5,0.86,1449120062.0

•Inflation (CPI) is virtually zero, if not literally zero


•OPEC already said they would not cut oil production. Oil is a necessary component for many goods (and some services). OPEC's refusal to cut oil production will likely put downward pressure on prices


•Unemployment in the US has improved somewhat, but underemployment remains an issue. On top of that, many young people have lots of student debt, which is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. This has a downward effect on demand, which puts downward pressure on prices.


•Interest rate hikes are usually to combat inflation as they reduce the inflation rate.


Given these facts, wouldn't an interest rate hike by the Fed in the near future (tomorrow, or if not tomorrow, then early 2016) drop CPI inflation to negative zone (i.e. deflation)?

Fuel poverty, or energy poverty as it is also known as, occurs when a household is unable to afford the most basic levels of energy for adequate heating, cooking, lighting and use of appliances in the home.

The consequences of fuel poverty include a restricted use of heating, cold and damp homes, debts on utility bills and a reduction of household expenditure on other essential items. In addition, fuel poverty is associated with a wide range of physical and mental health illnesses, such as depression, asthma and heart disease.

The idea came to my mind thinking about student loans: the universities can and keep raising the fees because the amount of money a student can pay is: money that student's family has allocated for the uni plus the student loan he/she could apply for. If the student loans where limited to a minimum amount of money then the uni couldn't raise the fees so much.

t3_3yii4v,Sweden's housing disaster. Stand in line… for the next decade. How Sweden's disastrous housing market will force people to wait 5 to 10 years for a first hand rental contract.,"What's happening in Sweden is something unheard of in the world. 
Not just in Stockholm but anywhere in the country. Those who can't buy get stuck in an unfair over regulated system.

>Rent controls make finding vacant properties harder. Walking around Stockholm, one notices the complete lack of real estate agencies advertising vacant rental housing. Where do Stockholmers go to rent apartments? The answer is Stockholm City Council’s housing service. Incredibly, 430,000+ people are registered as waiting in this official housing queue system, and each year this queue grows longer. A Stockholm rental apartment typically involves a 7-8 year wait, and for popular inner city areas one can expect to wait 10 to 20 years. In 2013, one woman got an inner city Stockholm apartment after waiting 28 years in the housing queue. Housing shortages are not limited to large cities such as Stockholm, but are present all across Sweden. Indeed, 246 (84%) of Sweden’s 290 municipalities report a shortage of rental properties. This observation suggests rent control, among other factors, is an important contributor to Sweden’s crippling rental housing shortage.

Reagan had a recession in his first term as did Carter.  Reagan's recession was definitely planned by Federal Reserve chairman Volkner, in order to eventually lower inflation.  

The 70's are where the theory starts to get iffy, due to recessions caused by OPEC.  

Anyway, I think it's in a president's best interest to have a recession early in their first term.  It allows Wall Street to wipe their bad investments off the table, and it gives time for the Fed to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy back to normal before the next election.

If these companies collapse suddenly, it could create some shocks in the market and some panic dumping (lol) of other commodity-tracking ETFs.

Another possible cause could be the interest rate hike. I don't believe .25% will do anything too major (besides what it has already done to the bond market) but once we are a couple years into this gradual hike we will definitely see what the U.S. economy is really built of.

a. increases while the consumer's productivity decreases (or stays constant), or  
b. decreases while the consumer's productivity increases (or stays constant)
...because of changes in efficiency or regulation, where regulation includes safety/quality, but not subsidies/tariffs.    

* Affordability changes due to efficiency changes may be caused by:   
a. economies/diseconomies of scale.  When a product's sales decline/increase, affordability decreases/increases.  
Example: When auto parts for old vehicles are no longer being manufactured en masse, the small scale manufacture of such parts happens on a smaller, more expensive scale, per unit.  
b. costs of production.  When production costs increase/decrease, affordability decreases/increases.  
Example: When ivory became rarer and harder to acquire, the price of pianos with ivory keys increased.  


* Affordability changes due to regulation include:  
a. safety.  When product safety increases/decreases, affordability decreases/increases. 
Example: When airbags were made mandatory in vehicles, the functionality of a vehicle was the same, but airbags increased the cost.  
b. quality.  when product quality increases/decreases, affordability decreases/increases.  
Example: When milk regulations prohibit rBST from being used in milk production, the consumption of milk is incurred at a higher cost.  
-allowed housing development.  When cities restrict the type/size/location of house-building, the utility of housing is incurred at a higher cost.   


* Affordability increases (for a consumer with a static or increasing productivity) is expected and understood, decreases in affordability is strange.  Decreased affordability caused by efficiency may happen naturally.  

* Affordability decreases (for a consumer with a static or increasing productivity) seems counter-intuitive.  This phenomena is caused by regulatory and efficiency changes.  While efficiency changes are natural and uncontrollable, regulatory changes are unnatural and controllable.  They decrease a consumer's ability to avoid decreases in standard of living.

t3_400kla,Alternative production model,"Hey guys. I'd like to open up a discussion regarding the economic future, particularly and mainly applicable to Europe. 

Let me start by making a statement I think we can all somewhat agree with: the economic model nowadays has/is in process of collapse. I personally don't think we need a PhD to identify problems based on noticing our own situations and/or what occurs around us. 

I'm currently living in Spain and the situation here is not sustainable. We all agree on the fact that we need to reactivate employment and all politicians claim to have the key to it. However I don't see neither feasibility nor sustainability. It's all just delaying the problem. I support an economic model which offers equal **opportunities** to its citizens; hence, I support a Welfare State. 

To maintain such a State, I think we firstly need to solve the current fertility rate issue caused by the many difficulties couples have to decide to build up a family. So it's a a vicious circle. We need to come up with an economic model that will let us keep the society we've built so far. An alternative production model. 

We currently have three economic sectors: primary, secondary and tertiary (some say there's a fourth knowledge-based sector; but I believe this one to be a sub-sector within the tertiary sector). We need a fourth (or fifth) sector.

I believe this is the question economists should ask themselves. I believe we have come to a point in history where we need to start a new way of producing to balance the economy once again.

t3_3zz7iu,Why isn't there a distinction drawn between small and large cap firms when considering minimum wage laws?,"The main argument I keep hearing for reducing the minimum wage (or against increasing it) is that small business won't be able to continue to employ the required number of workers to remain profitable. 

Why don't they make a distinction between small business and big business? 

In Australia, we have small business tax concessions for businesses under $2 million turnover per year so that small business can continue to operate more profitably while big business must still wear the tax because they are large and profitable enough to wear it.

Why doesn't the same logic apply to minimum wage? That way small businesses can continue to operate profitably and big businesses (e.g. Walmart) can't exploit workers at $4/hour. Which they can do because of their market power right?

Does the wage really play that big of role in the profit margins of big business that it would notably inflate the prices of goods or force closures of branches by forcing big business to pay a $15 minimum wage whilst allowing small business to retain the lower minimum wage?

I mean just because the minimum wage would go up 200 or 300% I doubt one would see prices going up that much in big business to offset it. I don't know the particulars of the alternative (people being proportionately culled/stores being closed down) but surely the amount of employment that big business contributes won't change that much because they will still have a minimum number of workers they need to run the store (assuming that it is still running profitably as a big business entity)

The only other thing I can think of is from the non-economical perspective. i.e. just because small business is in a more fragile position than big business it doesn't mean that different rules should be applied to them because a standard of living should be a right given to all people equally, regardless of whether they are employed in small or big business.

There’s a picture, and now here are some statements:

30,000 dollars, after taxes, is actually a lot of money.

Anything above that is even better.

You can have a place to stay, get to buy what you want to eat instead of buying cardboard noodles, pay for high speed internet and smart phones, lease a vehicle, be a streamer, buy and play video games, or do something else, at a moderate level.

If you’re single, you can rent out a room. That’s what, 500 dollars a month after the deposit.

12 months, 30,000 dollars, you have 2,500 for each month, evenly.

500 for rent, 500 for food, 500 for utilities + car lease + internet + phone + hygiene, 1,000 for whatever you want. 

And when I state 500 for food, that’s actually a very generous amount, because let’s say you eat out many days, and a tasty meal you get out is as low as 5 dollars but average 7 dollars, 10 dollars rarely, and 15 dollars on crazy days, for each meal, though realistically, you’re not going to spend 15 dollars for each meal within a day, more like one 5 dollar meal, and two 7 dollar meals, then maybe a couple snacks and drinks for an additional 10 dollars every 3 or 4 days. Some days, you’ll cook at home, and that’s like 10 dollars for the entire day.

If you pay extra to get more than a room, despite you getting peace and quite in your room and being able to cook and whatnot and being undisturbed, that’s luxury.

Now look at those who make 18,000 or less. 40 percent of 18,000? That’s less than 9,000 a year. You’re homeless. Oh, you make less than 18,000? We’ll give you reduced tax, 30%. 30% of 17,000? That’s less than 6,000 a year; you’re homeless.

People making minimum or less than minimum wage are the ones doing the most of the sweating and bleeding just to get by, and even the little they make, is getting a huge portion of it taken away, when they couldn’t even get by in the first place.

No one really gave a fuck about them nor gave them a break, and if they want help, they have to go through painstakingly stressful and time-consuming procedures to apply and wait and do things they have no time for because their every waking hour consists of mechanical slave labor and suffering.

They don’t even have time to complain. Only when they had enough and say ‘fuck it’ and go bonkers, do they have the time to do anything, like complain about the fucked up system.


But those who actually have a livelihood and get to do things that a person would want, they complain about the percentage that is being removed from their wages, despite having something to work with after taxes?

People who make minimum or near minimum wage don't have hobbies, they have sleep and work; that's it.

No one helps them because they have no fucking time to do anything but to work, so their voices aren't heard, they're the ones listening to the bitchass customer being a spoiled brat. They're the ones droning their lives and being buttfucked by privileged people in fortunate circumstances, whom have the time and the money and resources to bitch and complain about their well-being not being well enough.

1,000 dollars is a lot to someone who makes 1,000 per month.

You got taxed 25,000 dollars for your year? Aw, how unfortunate of you; you have only like 3,000 dollars a month. To you, that's somehow as bad or worse than for someone who doesn't even make what you lost in taxes, per year. ",4,0.83,1453774726.0
t3_432wn6,Simple question about currency,"Is there a fundamental difference between bartering raw resources and using paper, backed by raw resources, to buy things? Obviously you wouldn't have the metal right there for the transaction, but you're essentially bartering with the help of the bank.

If this were true, then the concept of exchanging something based upon trust has only been heavily used in the past 100 years, no? I'm familiar with natives that used wampum beads and the Chinese started using fiat currency in 1000 AD, but has there ever been a large economy that solely used currency backed by trust, prior to the 20th century?

Furthermore, what are the arguments in favor of and in opposition to trust vs resource currency?

The biggest negative that I can see regarding resource-based is that people would be encouraged to destroy the entire natural world in search of more gold/silver/etc, and that a new discovery (either a deposit or maybe an experimental way to create the resource) would instantly devalue everyone's currency.

The biggest positives that I can see regarding resource-based is that no one would be able to modulate the supply of the currency, so markets would be less imposed upon and possibly more stable as a result.

The big argument that I've heard in favor of trust-based currency is that a steady level of inflation encourages investment of capital and, with the creation of a federal bank, allows Big Brother to theoretically save the day if everyone fucks up. There's a whole logistical argument, but let's not get into that.",2,1.0,1453980369.0

t3_44wwy8,"Economic misconception or theory? Have anyone read about this on papers, journals, etc...","I was thinking the other day about the complete use of resources such as portfolio assets or for example a factory daily budget used at 100%. So in order to buy a new stock or do something new in the factory within the day, this will make the respective manager to take resources from one task to assign that money to a new one. When this happens there is always a cost benefit analysis on doing so and trying to find a conclusion whether its going to bring the performance up or down. 

*So putting this on the financial perspective within an asset allocation scheme and to simplify it lets think that there is no cash held and all the portfolio assets are invested in the market.*  

**Quick example:** When big fund managers make changes to their portfolios this means they are, for example, selling one stock and buying another one this will make one stock to go down and the new inflow will drive the new bought stock upwards. 

The latter and so many other examples makes me think that always when something is performing well there has to be something within its universe decreasing or bad performing. This can be seen on things such as countries when the develop economies where flooded on the subprime crisis, developing markets where having their best performance in years. Now that the US is finally recovering we see those same developing markets performing badly. When you get a new job at a company and there's someone who left that job before you, so they may be out there searching for a new job which will make him busy again and **maybe** someone unemployed....

Is this necessarily some kind of rule, if this was so, could we find the exact correlations between different phenomenas that may led us to find beahviour guidelines in societies or industries?

So I leave the question open for comments. Sorry if this is something posted already, or if its already studied please link all the references.

thanks, sorry for the long post.

t3_45dk09,How much money is the oil company making when gas is at an average $2 a gallon?,"I made a rough estimate because I want someone to tell me where I'm wrong here.  There are forty-two gallons in a barrel of oil and if you pay two dollars a gallon that is 84 dollars.  Pretty simple math right.  So a company pays for 50 barrels (2100 gallons) at thirty dollars a piece (1500 before tax).  If a company sells every last gallon at two dollars they make forty-two hundred dollars ($4200).  The difference between what they paid and what they made is twenty-seven hundred dollars ($2700).  

I looked around for some facts about profit margins to see what I could find.  According to one article, they didn't have sources for me to check) Walmart has a 3.1% profit margin off a sale and 'Big Oil' has a 5.1% profit margin.  I'm not here to argue over whether they pay too little in taxes or too much or they don't pay their full share or anything like that.  I want a nonpartisan answer or just how much money is being squeezed out of each sale.

From what I assume.  They don't have a huge profit margin, hence the 5.1%.  The $2700 needs to be broken up to pay for the gas station, the delivery, the workers, insurance payments, pension plans, lawsuits, etc.  Doesn't seem like a lot of money is left over here.

t3_45n6p1,Advice needed.,"This is a throwaway as my other identity would easily identify me and I dont want that. Also I am not sure if this is the right sub for me either. 
Anyways I started a fast casual restaurant 3 years ago. Our first location started out gangbusters and quickly lost money due to bad labor and cost of goods. We opened a second shortly after the first due to the opportunity and our perceived momentum. As a brand we were attractive to investment and my original minority partner (I am still majority owner) picked up what could be considered an angel investor. He helped fund a third store in which we dumped significant investment. Since then we have also opened a fourth store. I know there is so much wrong with what I have written so far as in terms of growth before prime costs are achieved and how that is a bad idea. I get that. I can answer a bunch of questions about the above individually as asked.

My major dilemma now is the angel investor. While still a minority shareholder I allowed his money to influence aspects of the business and while fighting him on his worst ideas allowed some in as i didnt see the long term harm in some of them.He has zero restaurant experience and he likes to have me impart ideas from what he sees elsewhere. He decided all restaurants needed a GM and KM. One or two locations can support that but the others cannot support two salaries easily. Wanted to offer breakfast. We did. We didnt see booming sales in a month so we closed it. He must have had a good time at a sports bar so our original and most under performing location of course needs to turn into a sports bar. He is pissed ass the Superbowl launch was not packed to the gils. There are plenty more examples but we are running out of money and he is threatening to take over. I put everything I have into this and am living hand to mouth right now. It has huge potential to have national growth. I have structural investment into corporate software and have made all the moves towards that direction. I still have work to do bringing down labor and cogs but as a whole I have 3 profitable locations. 

I just feel that by me implementing the will of someone who does not know what they are doing and doesnt even understand the day to day operations we have come to this. My fault I agree but its not as easy as that. 

I have no real money to fight what he may will. I will run out of cash and he has now assumed the role of CEO due to a clause in the partnership agreement. He recently asked to buy enough shares to own the majority as well. I would sell them but not to him. It would make them worthless in my opinion as it is doomed to fail if he truly run it. I still am president and run day to day but he thinks our losses are attributed to me. 

I know this may have rambled a bit and there are many other details to the story but does anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation?

t3_4c7kzz,Financial Times : The losers are revolting against the elites. This is a serious threat,">Losers have votes, too. That is what democracy means — and rightly so. If they feel sufficiently cheated and humiliated, they will vote for Donald Trump, a candidate for the Republican party’s presidential nomination in the US, Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France or Nigel Farage of the UK Independence party. 
There are those, particularly the native working class, who are seduced by the siren song of politicians who combine the nativism of the hard right, the statism of the hard left and the authoritarianism of both.

>Above all, they reject the elites that dominate the economic and cultural lives of their countries: those assembled last week in Davos for the World Economic Forum. The potential consequences are frightening. Elites need to work out intelligent responses. It might already be too late to do so.

>The projects of the rightwing elite have long been low marginal tax rates, liberal immigration, globalisation, curbs on costly “entitlement programmes”, deregulated labour markets and maximisation of shareholder value. The projects of the leftwing elite have been liberal immigration (again), multiculturalism, secularism, diversity, choice on abortion, and racial and gender equality. Libertarians embrace the causes of the elites of both sides; that is why they are a tiny minority.

>In the process, elites have become detached from domestic loyalties and concerns, forming instead a global super-elite. It is not hard to see why ordinary people, notably native-born men, are alienated. They are losers, at least relatively; they do not share equally in the gains. They feel used and abused. After the financial crisis and slow recovery in standards of living, they see elites as incompetent and predatory. The surprise is not that many are angry but that so many are not.

>Branko Milanovic, formerly of the World Bank, has shown that only two parts of the global income distribution enjoyed virtually no gains in real incomes between 1988 and 2008: the poorest five percentiles and those between the 75th and the 90th percentile. The latter includes the bulk of the population of high-income countries.

>Mr Trump is protectionist on trade and hostile on immigration. These positions appeal to his supporters because they understand they have one valuable asset: their citizenship. They do not want to share this with countless outsiders. The same is true for supporters of Ms le Pen or or Mr Farage.

>Nativist populists must not win. We know that story: it ends very badly. In the case of the US, the outcome would have grave global significance. America was the founder and remains guarantor of our global liberal order. The world desperately needs well-informed US leadership. Mr Trump cannot provide this. The results could be catastrophic. 

>Western countries are democracies. These states still provide the legal and institutional underpinnings of the global economic order. If western elites despise the concerns of the many, the latter will withdraw their consent for the elite’s projects. In the US, elites of the right, having sown the wind, are reaping the whirlwind. But this has happened only because elites of the left have lost the allegiance of swaths of the native middle classes.

>Not least, democracy means government by all citizens. If rights of abode, still more of citizenship, are not protected, this dangerous resentment will grow. Indeed, it already has in too many places.

t3_4c5spv,Economists name the Fed’s biggest interest-rate hawks,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Several Federal Reserve speakers have this week agitated for interest rates to move higher sooner rather than later, confusing some market watchers.

After all, the Fed’s latest policy statement — and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s accompanying news conference — was widely seen as signaling that the U.S. central bank is in no hurry to raise rates.

It turns out the hawks were first to the microphone after the March 15-16 meeting.

In December, the Fed increased its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nine years. At the time, a majority of members said they wanted four more hikes in 2016.

After the Fed’s meeting last week, a 10-member majority said they foresaw just one or two.

But underneath the surface, seven others — anonymously, in the Fed’s customary “dot plot” forecast — said they expect three or four rate hikes this year. ",3,0.8,1459090462.0

There is a short summary of the paper in the Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership#Implications (there is also a graph at the bottom, here is a permalink https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trans-Pacific_Partnership&oldid=716715167#Implications for readers in case the article changes in the future). Here is the summary from the Wikipedia article (emphasis added by me):

However, **Tufts University economists argued that the research by Petri relied on unrealistic assumptions such as full employment: lost jobs will be immediately replaced in other industrial sectors**.

**The Tufts researchers published a report of the TPP's economic effects, which said that the TPP would have a negative impact on employment: 450,000 US jobs, 75,000 Japanese jobs, 58,000 Canadian jobs and 5,000 New Zealand jobs would be lost by 2025**. According to the report, **771,000 jobs would be lost in total and positive economic effects would be negligible for participating countries**.

**Abstract of the paper**:

Proponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) emphasize its prospective economic benefits, with economic growth increasing due to rising trade volumes and investment. 

Widely cited projections suggest modest GDP gains after ten years, varying from less than half a percentage point in the United States to 13 percent in Vietnam. However, these projections assume full employment and constant income distribution in all countries excluding some of the major risks of trade liberalization.

In this paper, we provide alternative projections of the TPP’s economic effects using the United Nations Global Policy Model. Allowing for changes in employment and income distribution, we obtain very different results. We find that the benefits to economic growth are even smaller than those projected with full-employment models, and are negative for Japan and the United States. More important, we find that the TPP will likely lead to losses in employment and increases in inequality.",151,0.94,1461627518.0

t3_4i5zlh,The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to legalize corruption,"**Welcome to the oligarchy - Please bend over for your corporate masters**

* The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United marches like a zombie precedent, destroying all in its path. First the case turned the law of campaign finance into a useless corpse. Now it appears the law of political bribery is the next victim. Citizens United let rich people buy candidates; now they may be able to purchase office-holders, too.

* That’s the message from the Court’s argument last week in the appeal of Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia. He was convicted, along with his wife, in a scheme that netted the onetime First Family of the Commonwealth about a hundred and seventy-seven thousand dollars in loans, vacations, and luxury goods from a Richmond businessman. And yet, while the statements of Justices during oral arguments are not always perfect predictors of how they will vote, there was clearly a great deal of bipartisan sympathy on display for this appalling former public servant.

* In the McDonnell case, his lawyers argued that what federal prosecutors called bribery was also really just speech by Jonnie R. Williams, the McDonnells’ benefactor. Noel Francisco, McDonnell’s lawyer, did a skillful job of giving a constitutional gloss to the seedy facts of his client’s case. Williams plied the McDonnell family with expensive vacations, a Rolex watch, fifteen thousand dollars for their daughter’s wedding reception, the use of a Ferrari, and a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in loans in an effort to get the governor to promote Williams’s nutritional-supplement enterprise. According to Francisco, Williams was only paying for access (which is generally legal), not government action (which is not). As the lawyer put it in his oral argument, “The line is between access to decision-makers, on the one hand, and trying to influence those decisions, on the other.” In this view, it’s permissible for McDonnell to be paid for official access, just not for official acts.

* The Court seems determined to define quid pro quo so narrowly that it’s practically impossible to find.

* McDonnell’s lawyer argued, there was no quid pro quo because McDonnell did not take an official action on behalf of Williams’s supplements. All the governor did was host a luncheon to announce the launch of Williams’s new product and set up meetings for Williams with officials at the University of Virginia’s medical school. 

* Justice Stephen Breyer seemed especially concerned about the other side of the charged quid pro quo. He appeared to assert that a conviction of McDonnell would criminalize normal interactions between citizens and government officials. *“For better or for worse, it puts at risk behavior that is common, particularly when the quid is a lunch or a baseball ticket, throughout this country,”* Breyer told Michael Dreeben, the Deputy Solicitor General, who represented the government. Wouldn’t a conviction here criminalize such trivial exchanges? No, Dreeben said, because *“there is a very critical protection here. It’s a requirement of showing something beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.""* If the amounts were trivial, jurors wouldn’t convict.

* As in Citizens United, the Justices appeared heading toward requiring a specific and obvious quid pro quo—a formalism that ignored the workings of the real world. The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to legalize corruption

Here, in their own capital city, they no longer call the shots.",">England’s establishment is not what it was; the old imperial elite has become crude and mercenary. On Monday, a British civil servant was photographed arriving in Downing Street for a national security council meeting with an open document in his hand. We could read for ourselves lines from a confidential report on how Prime Minister David Cameron’s government should respond to the Crimea crisis. It recommended that Britain should “not support, for now, trade sanctions,” nor should it “close London’s financial center to Russians.”

>The White House has imposed visa restrictions on some Russian officials, and President Obama has issued an executive order enabling further sanctions. But Britain has already undermined any unified action by putting profit first.

>It boils down to this: Britain is ready to betray the United States, to protect the City of London’s hold on dirty Russian money. And forget about Ukraine.

>
Britain, open for business, no longer has a “mission.” Any moralizing remnant of the British Empire is gone; it has turned back to the pirate England of Sir Walter Raleigh. Britain’s ruling class has decayed to the point where its first priority is protecting its cut of Russian money — even as Russian armored personnel carriers rumble around the streets of Sevastopol. But the establishment understands that, in the 21st century, what matters are banks, not tanks.

>The Russians also understand this. They know that London is a center of Russian corruption, that their loot plunges into Britain’s empire of tax havens — from Gibraltar to Jersey, from the Cayman Islands to the British Virgin Islands — on which the sun never sets.

>British residency is up for sale. “Investor visas” can be purchased, starting at £1 million ($1.6 million). London lawyers in the Commercial Court now get 60 percent of their work from Russian and Eastern European clients. More than 50 Russia-based companies swell the trade at London’s Stock Exchange. The planning regulations have been scrapped, and along the Thames, up go spires of steel and glass for the hedge-funding class.

>Britain’s bright young things now become consultants, art dealers, private banker and hedge funders. Or, to put it another way, the oligarchs’ valets.

>
Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, gets it: you pay them, you own them. Mr. Putin was absolutely certain that Britain’s managers — shuttling through the revolving door between cabinet posts and financial boards — would never give up their fees and commissions from the oligarchs’ billions. He was right.

>In the austerity years of zero growth that followed the 2008 financial crash, this new source of vast wealth could not be resisted.

>This is Britain’s growth business today: laundering oligarchs’ dirty billions, laundering their dirty reputations.

>The Shard encapsulates the new hierarchy of the city. On the top floors, “ultra high net worth individuals” entertain escorts in luxury apartments. By day, on floors below, investment bankers trade incomprehensible derivatives.

>
Come nightfall, the elevators are full of African cleaners, paid next to nothing and treated as nonexistent. The acres of glass windows are scrubbed by Polish laborers, who sleep four to a room in bedsit slums. And near the Shard are the immigrants from Lithuania and Romania, who broke their backs on construction sites, but are now destitute and whiling away their hours along the banks of the Thames.

>The Shard is London, a symbol of a city where oligarchs are celebrated and migrants are exploited but that pretends to be a multicultural utopia. 

>Here, in their capital city, the English are no longer calling the shots. They are hirelings.

There are lots of reasons for investment crowd-funding to become something really really big:

* Security - for centuries banks where the primary source of financing new enterprises, then began a new era of angel investors and venture capital - they reduced potential risks for entrepreneurs and provided them with cash, in return they received a stake in the enterprise. Very often after an initial success they took over the company leaving the founder out of business. Investment crowdfunding is very different in this sense since the number of potential borrowers is huge it is not that easy for anyone to take over the company. It means a higher level of security for the potential founder.
* Cost effectiveness - entrepreneur is almost always winning when he is financing his enterprise through crowd-funding platforms, most of the banks seem to lose interest in small business and prefer huge corporations to them. Interest rates proposed by these banks usually also too big. Investment crowd-funding gives an entrepreneur incredible opportunities to find a very cheap source of credit.
* True alternative to a stock market investing - as we all know, almost all the companies experience their highest growth in their first three-five years, so by investing in a company at the seed phase potentially you can receive higher returns than you can get in the stock market.

What do you think about investment crowd-funding? Is it a new reliable industry, which one day can become a serious contender to a stock market, or it is just a flash in the pan?

t3_4m1fz1,How to remove the artificial scarcity.,"I see that many services remain unused because people don't have enough money, while there are not necessarily not enough resources, this means we have created an artificial scarcity.

For example, you want to go to the cinema but you don't go because you don't want to spend money. Meanwhile, the cinema barely is affected the more people go (the building will hold, the movies can be played repeatedly) (though yes, it will have some more employee to do some work).

So you could say, that the society ideally wants it's services to be used as much as the people want, and the provider also wants to give as much as possible (assuming you like your job).

Yet we have created a system wherein we constantly hold ourselves back.

I wonder how exactly this is created, I assume by the use of money though a debt based system?:

So money comes mainly into the system through loans: the bank gives you have a 100, yet you have to pay a 110 back; creating artificial scarcity I assume. ",6,1.0,1464790567.0

>There is a housing shortage, with more demand than offer of apartments, especially in the biggest cities. It is quite hard to get a first hand rental contract. As swedes love to queue, to get a first hand rental contract, one also must queue (in Boplats), and it can take years for you to get a first hand contract in some specific areas of Gothenburg, for example. I have a friend who lives in Stockholm that she has a 2 years old daughter and she has just put her daughter in the queue system so she can rent a nice apartment when she turns 18. The time to get a first hand contract there is even longer, and apparently many people do that. I think this is very odd. 

>Then, since it is difficult to get a first hand rental contract, many newcomers get a second hand contract, which are then subject to higher prices, in many cases, since the person who owns the first hand contract can chose the price. This is what happens in many countries, where the prices are usually not well regulated. These second hand contracts are usually offered at Blocket or Facebook groups (beware the scams on these groups, they are everywhere, but they are also easy to spot. Most important rule: never transfer money to anyone without first seeing the apartment, and meeting that person.)

The government wants to produce licence plates to sell to the general population. It has essentially free labor in a prison. The workers can't leave the prison and they have to do what the warden tells them to do. It is impossible for any other domestic supplier to make licence plates at a competitive price.

By allowing offshoring to low wage countries without allowing the corresponding flow of workers creates essentially the same conditions. The concept that labor conditions and wages will rise due to offshoring in preferred countries such as Mexico and the like has been proven to be false. This is because the USA and other western ""first world"" nations have no ability (and no motivation) to force those offshore jurisdictions to raise wages or conditions.

http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1070289X.2016.1142879

Even where foreign workers are imported to work in western nations such as North Korean workers in Europe it has been documented that those workers are exploited while employed pursuant to these programs. 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/north-korea-workers-forced-labour-abroad-un-report

While it may be colored as the North Koreans exploiting the workers the reality is that the benefit of their labor is going to European markets. In fact, there are those who feel that the western sanctions against North Korea force North Korea to participate because of its need to obtain foreign currency and this is one of its only possible means of access aside from stepping back from its own internal policies as dictated by western nations.

Another case in point is the recent fiasco regarding South African fire fighters in Fort MacMurray Alberta, Canada. 300 fire fighters were brought back home to SA because although the labor laws in Alberta provide for a minimum wage, South Africa has another and Alberta can't force the South African contractor to pay Alberta wages to its workers.

However, where are we now? Yesterday's Fed announcement sounded to me like the start of another loosening cycle or at a minimum the end of tightening. Is the Fed going to start to target asset prices again? I may start to bias toward long positions if the Fed is either on hold or moving to a bias of getting easier.

But it's really confusing right now. The fed can only cut rates twice before they're at the zero bound again.

Tunisia Economic City will be the hub for international companies to exchange know how, expertise, new technologies, and trade with their Tunisian counterparts from all of Tunisia through this center. Dr. Toukabri emphasizes this is not a real estate development project, though real estate development has a central role to play, this is an economic power center to link the world with Africa from the main gate in the north. 

Cities within Tunisia Economic City include a logistic city, an industrial city, a Healthcare City, a media city, sports city, knowledge city, research and development city, a Silicon Valley city called Silicon Africa and others. 

The location in the north of Africa, on the Mediterranean Sea and the proximity to Europe adds more benefits to Tunisia Economic City, in addition to being a free zone city. 

Latest news from Tunisia Economic City is the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Dubai based ABC Technique FZE to develop Silicon Africa within TEC based on a PPP partnership over an area of 1,600,000 square meters.

Now, if you want to build the optimal measure of inflation over time in the United States, you just need to stitch the following partial series together, and multiply every entry in each series by certain figures to rebase them into a compatible whole. More specifically...

January 1913 - December 1966: CPI-U multiplied by 100/168.3

January 1967 - November 1977: CPI-U-X1 multiplied by 100/168.3

December 1977 - November 1999: CPI-U-RS multiplied by 100/247.3

December 1999 - present: C-CPI-U transcribed as-is

The above procedure will rebase everything to December 1999, the base for the C-CPI-U. Technically, you can rebase it to any time you want, but since the C-CPI-U is the current best choice, it makes it easier to update rather than having to rebase every new figure.

What economists can't seem to figure out is that this is not the 1940s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s or early 2000s. In fact, today looks a lot more like the Great Depression of the 1930s. Economists and strategists love to reference previous time periods, with the most often quoted being the 1990s (anecdotally). We believe they are not going back far enough- you have to go all the way back to the Great Depression to find a truly similar time period.

The only way for a solid economy is to plug the giant leaks. That in itself would steer us into a powerful economy and to do that, we would have to transfer power from the hands of the few to the hands of the many in some new kind of democracy where we create our country together. 

Through massive oversight and transperancy, we can identify the leaks and plug them. We can sit here and speculate about the economy for kingdom come, but that the only solution.

>Decades of weak construction levels combined with a fast growing population has made new homes scarce. Over 80 percent of Sweden's municipalities are suffering shortages, a 30 percent increase since last year, the National Board of Housing said.

>Stockholm house prices soared 12 percent in the last year and there is a waiting time of around 10 years for rental homes.

>Song said strict regulations, including a constitutional law that allows municipalities to veto building plans, tie the government's hands.

>The problem with the Swedish housing market is that there are no houses and there is no market,"" said Emil Kallstrom, a spokesman for the opposition Center Party after the centre-right pulled out of the talks last week.

>Figures from the National Institute of Economic Research showed that over 40 percent of construction companies said expansion was being held back, mainly due to lack of labour. That was a sharp rise from around 5 percent two years ago.

r can be decompose into two return components:

- r_safe: return on safe capital, ie AA and higher government bonds
- r_risky: return on risky capital, ie business, stocks, machinery, buildings...

The exact weighting w is not known but we can decompose r as follows:

- r=w * r_safe+(1-w) * r_risky where  0<w<1

For most of recorded human history r_safe>0...however one way to make r=g would be to make r_safe<0 or negative rates. This correction requires significantly less political strength than a wealth tax and can be implemented stealthily without much uproar other than academic.

t3_4ztj18,"Is price inflation really inflation, or is todays price inflation the result of deflation?","To establish all we ever have is deflation we firstly have to look at the traditional definition of “inflation” still taught in schools & universities that tells us inflation is simply a rise in ​prices caused by an ​increase in the ​money ​supply, which is an increase of circulation that respectively exceeds the cost or demand of goods & services that is just assumed price inflation causative, so the question begs to be asked is how can inflation possibly exist today when the second grade mathematics clearly tells us we are instead always in a state of perpetual deflation due to interest, which can only ever cause artificial price inflation that’s nonetheless deflationary anyhow.

Either way its clear it wouldn’t matter if we had inflation or deflation today, simply because we would still have artificial price inflation so long as we’re paying interest, although its mathematically impossible to ever have inflation even by today’s definition of inflation which is nonetheless circulatory inflation, but its nevertheless circulatory inflation that can never transpire so long as we are paying principal+interest out of a volume of circulation that only ever consists of some remaining principal at the very most.

So we can deduce now there never was, nor can there ever be inflation under banking, only artificial price inflation caused by interest & a process of reflation (not inflation) due to interest, both of which “interest & reflation” indicates a state of perpetual deflation by interest.

Inflation even by today’s definition taught in universities & schools is what we at MPE correctly term circulatory inflation to avoid any misconceptions relating to “price inflation” & for a very good reason, because its already apparent inflation is not the cause of price inflation today, not to suggest the possibility it can if we ever did have circulatory inflation, nor does MPE ignore this possibility either if any one was to simply look at MPE’s 1.1.1 ratio that solves any event or possibility of inflation & deflation, however if anyone was to ever suggest inflation is price inflation causative one would logically have to first prove & demonstrate an increase of circulation ever exceeded the cost of goods & services, which clearly hasn’t been the case in the entire history of banking, contrary to what history keeps telling us & what usury media keeps ramming down our throat’s even today, only to be regurgitated by everyone without ever substantiating the existence of inflation or even the existence of hyperinflation for that matter.

Of course so called economics taught in universities & schools doesn’t differentiate between “circulatory inflation” & “price inflation”, so they simply define them both under the one heading “inflation” which just assumes any ​increase in the ​money ​supply is price inflation causative, so when you hear people talking about inflation today its often used ambiguously that’s almost always misinforming & misleading, even by today’s economists (pretend experts) that have been trained to more so confuse themselves if not you in their preposterous assumptions, who are often just trained spin doctors reporting on the symptoms of a failing economy, only ever attempting to justify a system of exploitation instead, apposed to truly informing you with any real expertise in economics, which of course proves today’s purported economists are not even economists. Not by definition of presumed expertise. Not even with their usury PhD’s, degrees’ & doctorates that would otherwise have you all irrationally believing they are experts in economics.

Where most people go terribly wrong today including pretend economists is to just assume any increase in debt is just printing too much money equal to that sum of debt & there are really only two errors in this irrational method of deduction.

1) They’re failing to even recognize the total sum of debt purportedly owed to a bank is a sum principal & interest , therefore failing to even conclude the circulation is only ever comprised of the principal that we purport borrow into circulation in our personal debts in the fist place, much less ever contemplating the sum of interest is neither created or issued into circulation above the sum of principal.

2) They’re likewise failing to see national debt, bailouts, even QE is not ever introducing any new money into circulation, failing to conclude national debt can only be instead a process that perpetually reflates a forever deficient circulation that’s always, always, always in a state of perpetual deflation, where national debt only ever perpetually reflates circulation with the same principal & interest we all formerly pay out of circulation, not only on all our personal falsified debts, but as consequence when each & every one of us spends money today.

Now if people did see these two simple irrefutable errors of fact in their assumptions they would naturally deduce its not inflation at all that causes today’s price inflation, but instead deflation, its the added cost of interest that industry & commerce passes on to the consumer in resulting price of goods & services, that can only ever irreversibly multiply artificial debt, stealing all that much further from us.

I mean we all blindly participate in this mass deception of inflation when we trade in business & commerce today, but people refuse to actually see it for what it really is sadly, most people would rather look at the escalation of artificial debt & just irrationally blame non-existent inflation or printing too much money without even thinking twice, much like the insane contradictory paradox of GDP that asserts today’s non-existent inflation is somehow still inflation, wholly artificial only in price, that’s indicating alleged growth in GDP, which can only ever be otherwise growth (deflation) entirely dedicated to service an ever greater escalation of artificial debt that’s mathematically impossible to pay down due to interest.

MMORPGs and similar games have terrible problems with inflation. You can get 5 gold (let's call it $5) from selling a wolf pelt. You can sell thousands of wolf pelts for $5 each as there is infinite demand. for them. Suddenly, the economy has thousands of extra dollars minted into the works. But prices remain fixed, so all the players become hyper-rich.

To counteract this, MMOs have Gold Sinks that take money out of the system. Like, you need to pay to repair your weapons, and buy new items. But these are never enough, there's always going to be a surplus per player. The most direct solution would be to simulate the real world economy... but wouldn't that be very difficult to accomplish?

t3_53ie04,"[Question] PBOC stepped in to boost Hibor, shoring up the yuan - why?","Preliminary apologies for any mistakes - I'm a maths undergrad with an interest in markets.

I was reading [this article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-19/yuan-interbank-rate-surges-in-hong-kong-in-sign-of-intervention) and here is my summary as far as I understand it:

The PBoC encouraged the selling of specific yuan-based derivatives and increased charges on yuan forex. This had the effect of massively boosting Hibor, the rate at which Hong Kong lenders charge overseas borrowers for the yuan.

Their key motives for doing this are:

1. China would prefer that the yuan is strong before the Fed meet later this week, since the chance of a hike is higher due to positive US core inflation data.
2. China would prefer that the yuan is strong when it is added to the basket of IMF reserve currencies later this month.

My question is, in points 1 & 2 above, why do China want a strong currency? Won't including it in the IMF reserve give it a greater overseas demand since it can be used for IMF-related matters, strengthening it? If the rate is hiked then it becomes more expensive to borrow the dollar mainly, so China does not want the yuan to become a cheap alternative? Does increasing Hibor strengthen the yuan by making it more expensive on a global relative scale? Any explanations would be very much appreciated!",3,0.68,1474302405.0

My father had founded and operated a small exporting business, majority of his trade going to and from South-Eastern nations such as Vietnam, Thailand, etc. His company was lost and our family executed an exodus to the United States of America to seek sanctuary and a new life.

I have read numerous articles regarding the event in both Korean and foreign sources. I am still having a difficulty understanding what truly transpired.

From what I understand, was this unfortunate event kind of like a domino effect, where one nation fell after another? 

Do correct me if I am wrong. 

* Korean economy basically crashed in the late 1990s. Caused major corporations to simply cease existing. Because of the nation's reliance on *jaebuls* or corporations, it caused a massive ripple effect, causing hundreds and thousands of businesses, small or large, to fail with it.

* Because of Korea's sudden emergence as one of the top Asian powerhouses (militarily, economically, etc.) since the Korean war, many Koreans grew more and more proud. *I do admit, it is a tremendous feat as a nation to recover so quickly after devastation.*

* These so called *jaebuls* or corporations were blinded by the sight of money. As the Korean moguls and corporations became more and more proud and corrupted, they simply started to borrow money to capitalize the benefits of continuously quick expansion without thinking much about the possible consequences led to the nation's economic downfall.

Now, my question is:  **how exactly did this start, for what reason, the process in which how it occurred, and the aftermath?**

Any details to shed some light on this unfortunate event will be greatly appreciated. Those who have actually experienced it as a grown adult, how did you recover? What were some of the feelings you felt?

This isn't a research project for school or anything. I would like to learn more about it, after all, it has affected my life at its core. I want to also understand what my estranged father had to go through.

Answering in laymen's terms would also be greatly appreciated. I did take some basic economic classes in college, and continue to educate myself on business in general.

I am looking for someone to explain in simpler terms what economist are trying to say about the misconception of free trade, lack of free trade, and how that affects jobs, job quality, and the price of goods.

From what I gathered, most Americans (especially people that I talk to) think that if we start manufacturing more goods in America it will create more jobs and the US economy will be more efficient when exporting more than importing. From what I've read this is false. Am interpreting info correctly? Does America have free-trade if we have tariffs?

I am 15 years old and I have a lot of questions about the US economy that I am having trouble coming up answers for (or at least answers I fully understand). My questions are specifically about the IRS and the Federal Reserve and the way they control the US economy. First the Federal Reserve. It is my understanding that they are not a government run organization, and they are responsible for distributing money to banks. My questions: 
How does the Federal Reserve decide to distribute money?

What is the structure of the Reserve in terms of leadership and who makes decisions for distribution? 

I have recently watched a ""conspiracy"" theory video on YouTube claiming that the Federal Reserve is really controlled by banks (I don't think it really explained how). Does the Federal Reserve give power to the banks above other banks, and do the banks have any methods of influencing the decisions of the Reserve?

Lastly, is the Federal Reserve really totally unmonitored by any outsiders? 

And for IRS, the video I mentioned above claims that it is also a corporation run by the banks. However, it seems to me that the IRS is a federal bureau that is directly under the federal government. My Questions: 

Is there no validity at all about a relationship between the IRA and large banks? 

How does the IRA enforce tax collection? (I am 15 so I have never had to pay taxes myself, this may be a stupid question to most so I apologize) 

How does the IRA distribute the money collected to the government? Does it pocket any money as a collection fee?

t3_5c9zp7,(QUESTION) A tax break for business but a wage increase for workers?,"So, now that the election is over and the president elect has been chosen. I decided to read over future trumps tax plan.



In this tax plan he states:
""The Trump Plan will lower the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. This rate is available to all businesses, both small and large, that want to retain the profits within the business.""



Now it is unlikely that the rate will be dropped down to 15%. More realistically it would be 20% which aligns with the plan of the speaker of the house of Representatives, Mr. Paul Ryan. That's still 15% less in taxes ALL companies would have to pay.



Now here is my question. Where does this money go?



I suppose the hope is to have it go back into the company to help it grow but realistically it would go into the pocket of the major owners.



What if future president Trump forced the companies to invest that 15% into its employees?




For instance: A company that makes $50 million a year at a tax rate of 35% would pay  $17.5 million in taxes. A company making the same but being taxed 20% would pay $10 million in taxes. That's $7.5 million they would be forced to give to their employees. If said company had 1,000 employees that would equal to a $7,500 salary increase for every employee.




Wouldn't this be more beneficial? Investing the money into the employees creates more productivity, increases moral, draws in more people wanting to work for the company, and would just be an all around better solution than putting into the pockets of millionaires.




Now I don't really have an extensive knowledge on the economy or business, but this was just a thought.

What if developed nations were to try equal pricing controls? Instead of ripping up trade agreements or making trade completely open, developed nations could potentially say we will allow X number of products to be imported at the prevailing prices that domestic producers are charging. The number X of imported products is controlled to prevent oversupply dumping and market oversaturation, and the price can't undercut domestic producers.

All producers then compete equally regardless of externalities. If the Chinese don't have a product that consumers would buy at the equal price point, they are going to have to engineer and innovate a product that will sell. If domestic producers are suddenly losing marketshare to Chinese competition, they are going to have to engineer and innovate a product that will sell.

These principles of mine are the main motivators:

- If a rational person depends on a system, either social or technical in nature, she/he has responsibility to understand that system and to exercise a control over that system to the degree that she/he is dependent on it.

- If a rational person can not exercise control over the system, either social or technical in nature, that she/he is dependent upon, she/he must cut dependence on it, possibly by creating an alternative system and replacing the old one.

Note: __Absolute understanding__ of a complex real world system __is impossible__, but we can always try to understand any system by using abstraction and generalization. That is why I talked about degrees and levels in context of understanding, control and dependence.

In order to understand we must question and critique what we already know and understand. You can not critique anything without understanding it first. Be careful not to misunderstand.

Economy as a subject in our culture is focused on markets, in other words on distribution aspect of economy, thus neglecting or ignoring production aspect of it.

Let us focus on production aspect of economy just because it is neglected or ignored, and let us critique production in context of Capitalism in order to gain better understanding of it.

I have a weird question, but I'll give some background first. I am examining the ""business"" (basically anything financial/economics-related) of a hypothetical series of space stations.

Each station has anywhere from 20k - 200k people, so they're not small.

Rather than operating in USD, I'm toying with the idea of having them use their own individual currency - like how the EU has the euro.

My theory was that an alternate currency would shield the stations from fluctuations on Earth, however I'm afraid having a significantly smaller economy could cause the new currency to be more volatile. To combat this, I've looked into [floating exchange rates](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp) vs [fixed exchange rates](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedexchangerate.asp), but I still can't come to a conclusion.

It is easy to to see the interest rates set by the Treasury. But I'm not sure how market speculation is analyzed. Is a 20 month EMA of NASDAQ, DJIA or S&P 500 (SPX) a good way to determine if speculation is running wild? 

How is it determined if there is a Credit Boom? And how can one determine how much Buying on Margin is going on?

t3_5jqypa,Economy of non-perishable goods,"Hello everyone, perhaps I am writing this in the wrong subreddit but I have a question. I am interested to know how an economy of non-perishable goods (such as diamonds or virtual items, for instance skins in Counter-strike) works. What I am specifacaly curious about is how a closed market of non-perishable goods would work, especially if new non-perishable items were constantly added to it.

Anyway, to further illustrate, lets say you have a game, in which you can obtain these non-perishable goods by playing (skins, items, anything that will never be consumed out of the system) and you can put the obtained items on the games closed market (not on steams market but a specific market in which only the games goods can be bought or sold) for the price you want to. The money can be put into the market, by a person adding it to his accounts balance, or taken out of it when a person reaches a certain ammount (you can take out 50$ but not 49.99$ for instance). 

The server provider would tax a small amount of each transaction to support the further development of the game. In case of inflations, since the items are non-perishable and can be created infinetly, and one person does not benefit from having several copies of the same item, some common items would soon become extreamly cheap and not worth selling. In that case the server provider would offer a better deal to sellers (0.5$ instead of 0.1$ for instance) and basically take out the excess goods, keeping inflation in check. The server provider would't destroy these cards, but would also take part in economy by later releasing bundless of items. The game would also periodically release new obtainable and diverse items, so there would, theoretically be no point at which everyone has everything they want to and have no need to participate in economy. I also want to point out that people would be able to participate in selling goods without ever putting cash in (besides a small amount to cover tax, or they would get taxed once they earn money, not before the transaction). 

I'm trying to create a system in which players could actually 'work' by playing the game and selling the goods, while others, which don't have as much time because of real world job, would pay to gain those goods without consuming time. Basically a game in which the players could support members of its community via market. You don't have money but have time, you can basically 'hire' yourself to produce goods (and content for multiplayer, as you are the content) and earn monry that way, or you have money but don't have time, you can spend that money to save yourself time and enjoy what you want to enjoy. 

Im just lerning economy, so if anything here made you cringe because it's not achiavable, I do appologize. Please, point out the flaws in this sort of system, and if you have any educative material that fits the topic of ""closed economy of non-perishable, ever increasing goods"" leave a link because I can't find anything on my own.",2,0.76,1482418644.0

Then the main characters bought creditswapps off of banks (or blanking the housing market as they referred to) and then selling them off.

Now my aquestion is: why is that?

Usually i would have thought that because more goods get produced, and the money mirrors the value of all goods and services, that you would now be able to afford more units of a certain good with the same amount of currency as before. (Which would be deflation)

Only thing that came to my mind was, that people might be more likely to invest in that situation, making the prices higher and therefore causing the inflation.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

I believe in free education to start. You would earn credits based on the courses you take. These credits would act as a second form of income for the purchase of basic survival. you will have to pass a test yearly to keep your credits. The schooling and resources covered for survival will be paid for by the workforce with higher taxes. however with a more educated workforce efficiency and productivity should raise to new levels.,3,0.66,1488613362.0
t3_5xlt3v,My great Economic trade off. Higher Human Development Index,"Hello my name is Andrew Robinson, and I come here today to further my understanding of the world around me. I've been working on this idea, it's been a passion of mine. I believe there should be a free non profit alternative to private schooling when it comes to higher education. Every one who seeks to further there education will receive credits upon completing the courses. these credits can be used to purchase only basic survival goods and services such as food and shelter. You have to join the workforce in order to spend your credits, and you have to complete some sort of continuing education. some credits could be worth more to drive competition and fulfill demand for specialists i.e. doctors. As an educated part of the workforce and survival covered you can earn more income and help your business produce more, which means higher taxes, and to make sure  the wealth is evenly distributed with a flat percentage tax. This is a necessary trade off to afford the education and cost of goods and services. With the rise of human capital through education productivity and efficiency of good and service will be on a steady increase. The average cost of living in the U.S. was $2,371 a month, now obviously that would be a lot lower since we only cover survival goods. the average cost for a student in one year is $15,009. the average cost per person in this idea is $17,400. with the 20.2 million students we have now the total is $70.3 billion/yr. I know that a lot of money, however In 2015, adults with bachelor's degrees took home more than those with high school diplomas. Degree holders earned $48,500 a year, while diploma holders earned $23,900. The GDP per capita would increase and thus allowing for a larger budget.

Humans in any service industry would become a luxury good, human's ""purpose"" would shift to something else and how would the wealth be distributed fairly since it's probable that the top 1% would own all of the machines.

1. Market caps

2. The pool from market caps going over should go back to the PEOPLE during the tax return at the end of the year


These 2 suggestions would fix:

Rent being to high

Insurance being to high

EVERYTHING BEING TO HIGH


Investments:

Investments are a system already designed for the rich already being in power of the marketing. People with low amounts of money can invest but it's an extremely low percentage of investments. As prices of rent continuing to go up and insurance being a LAW(WTF already right there). It will be an even lower percentage of people being able to invest or save any money due to it being to hard to live and save anything. It is a capitalist system that will inevitably become a slave work system. Meaning you will only make enough money to eat and go back to standard living without any form of entertainment because you will not be able to afford it. This in turn is a HUGE NEGATIVE to the economy and all small business will crumble until only a handful of people on the top own everything. This process has already started by letting one of the most successful BS billionaires win as president.

Investments are what helped kick start this system but now it's having a reverse effect.


Insurance being a law:

1. Majority is losing a LOT of money to pay for minorities mistakes

2. 1 major excuse is well it creates jobs...you know this in itself is an issue...imagine a world where everything is automated...and the only thing you need is law enforcement and politics to maintain chaos and engineers and scientists to maintain/create better machines. there would be hardly any jobs so what do we do? create unnecessary jobs that people don't want to do so people have something to do? That is sadly the current solution to this issue. There is quite a few people who state it is possible to automate nearly everything right now!
Think I-Robot without the BS about robots taking over the world.


Here is a good article about this i just googled real fast:
http://gawker.com/what-are-we-gonna-do-with-all-the-people-who-are-automa-1778871086


There is plenty of information about this throughout the net. I like this article because it actually does mention a livable check being sent to people after many things are fully automated. A great idea that may some day be a possibility as long as we can get over our absolute greed that is happening on the top. Let's face the facts you don't become rich by being honest. Sometimes it happens but not nearly as often as it should. Bill gates was a nice guy for the most part but he's sending a lot of his money over seas to try and a humanitarian difference...arguable right or wrong here...kind of a gray area. However TRUMP on the other hand does NOT do this...he is a con man and has successfully BS'ed half the country all the way to the top.

In today's world you are being FORCED to be safe.

it's the law to have your seat belt on

t3_62ka5u,"How is money created? Aka, Modern Economic Theory","Lately I've been having a fascination with political systems and theories but there is one aspect I can't wrap my head around; 

**How/where is a nation's money/currency created?**

When I was younger I've read both Das Kapital and The Wealth of Nations. Lately I've been attempting to read about Keynesian Economics, fractional-reserve banking, monetary policies, how central banks use interest rates to control inflation/deflation.

I can't get to the ""core"" of the issue though, I just don't seem to fully understand it. Maybe I need a 5-year economic degree to really understand it but I'm hoping an economical genius here can give me a ""crash course""?

I do understand it in the physical sense; the government has printing machines that makes money. Banks get some of these money and it's distributed to people and corporations.

**What I don't understand is more practical.**

**Example 1:** Say I work at a lumber mill. I do a job, the company pays me. The company gets their money from selling lumber to another company. This company is a mining company, they use the lumber to make supports in their mines. They pay their workers. Their money comes from selling bauxite to a foreign company. This money comes from another country's economy - that company pays workers with money they get either from selling something or from their government. This money again comes from taxes in some way or another.

**Example 2:** I work at an IT support company. I get payed by my company. The company has a contract with the government to support and deliver IT infrastructure. The government agency gets their money from the national budget which is funded by taxes. Those taxes comes from workers which gets their money from their pay which comes from where?

**Is the government (which is the people) essentially just ""leeching"" off itself in an endless circle? What is the ""point of origin"", where does it stop?**

Then there is another huge issue which just confuses me even more: fractional-reserve banking. As far as I understand this is widespread in most westernized countries today. My understanding is that banks can ""reuse"" the same physical cash to give out many loans. Which essentially means they ""create"" digital money without physical currency? Is this just some elaborate ""legitimized"" scam?

**This chain of thought started because I was thinking about Universal Basic Income.**

I was thinking to myself; so how would a country get the money required for a UBI? I guess taxes, but could they not just ""print"" the money? But if you print the money couldn't you just create some utopian nation where every citizen gets a billion dollars/pounds/kroner per year and everyone is rich? Then I was starting to think why this can't work, and hence it led me to my current state of my brain hurting from thinking too much...

Essentially is UBI just taking money from some people or some corporations to give money to all citizens?",10,0.82,1490954029.0

So I'm renting out on airbnb and one conundrum struck me today that you guys probably have no problems answering.

The idea is that I rent out the whole house plus 1 bed for one person for a cost of $50. 

Then, for every additional guest it costs $10, because the expenses are the same no matter how many visitors we have (not entirely true, see next paragraph). 

Now the problem is that it's way cheaper for groups to book all the rooms than it is for one person or couples. And the largest groups will raise the expenses a little bit. 

So I have no problem to rent out to groups, but I don't want the statistics to get lopsided towards groups as there are more expenses over time. 

So the question is: How do I price it so that any number of guests isn't significantly a better choice than any other? Is there a formula for what I'm proposing? airbnb allows me only to set one base price + one price for additionals, or else I'd just find a curve.

----

Here's some details for anyone interested or confused by my post. 

I have a big house, and I put three of the bedrooms + access to all of the house on airbnb. The rationale is that it should be cheap enough for one person to go here, and attractive for families as well. The reason I want families or groups as well is that the net profit is bigger while the expenses only grows a bit (there's also the wear and tear etc). 

Basically I wish for any group from one to six people to evenly book a room. So assuming every guest do the old ""divide total by how many we are"" would arrive at the same or near same price/incentive. 

I see that a single guest will pay more, but that's just how it is seeing as I pay almost the same for expenses (laundry is the same price if it's just the laundry of one or six, cleaning is the same). It pays off to be two or more, that's fine because it pays off for me too, but right now the cheapest alternative is to be at maximum beds which suddenly negates my profit. 

*sigh*

I know this is a wall of text, but it goes beyond the high school math I had...

Now, because I don't have a profound knowledge in economy, and because my English has its limits, I did not fully understand the core idea of Quantitative Easing (QE). In the above mentioned text it says on p. 929:

1. ""A sudden drop in consumer confidence about 20 points below its 12-month average (which would currently equate to a drop to the 75 level on the Conference Board measure).""    
2. ""A decline in aggregate hours worked below its level 3-months prior.""    
3. ""A year-over-year increase of about 20% in new claims for unemployment (which would currently equate to a level of about 340,000 weekly new claims).""

Regarding #2, index of aggregate hours ([CES0500000016](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0500000016)) continues to rise.

Regarding #3, rather than an increase, year-over-year change in new claims for unemployment are down.  They have dropped into historically numbers.  You have to go back to Richard Nixon years to see lower numbers and that was with a much smaller workforce.

And for the last prediction, we can look at [Real Personal Income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RPI).  That prediction has failed to materialize.

Eventually we will have a recession, due to normal business cycles.  And those who have been chanting ""A Recession is coming in ~~2011~~ ~~2012~~ ~~2013~~ ~~2014~~ ~~2015~~ ~~2016~~ 2017"" will claim to have been right all along.

t3_6cey86,"As bitcoin breaks above 2000 USD/BTC, and continues to climb, please take note of some secure methods for obtaining or exchanging bitcoin (and observations of its growth and use in the market).","You can monitor value of bitcoin on preev.com or find various long-term charts at https://blockchain.info/charts that will be helpful in assessment of what is or has gone on with bitcoin over time.  For other visualizations you can watch fiat flow ""into"" bitcoin in real-time at http://fiatleak.com/

By November 23, 2016, the market capitalization of bitcoins in circulation (total, around the world) was $11,908,463,816 (nearly 12 billion dollars), and the 24-hour transaction volume was equivalent to $224.9 M as per
https://coinmarketcap.com/
Measured in terms of money supply, that meant that the total market cap of bitcoins was at that time actually a more significant force in the market than was the total money supply of Estonia, Costa Rica, or Iceland at that time, as examples.

Today the bitcoin market cap is $33,971,006,369 (nearly 34 billion dollars), which is a larger force in the market today than the total money supply of Kuwait or Peru at the time of this post.

I strongly recommend against using Coinbase, Bitpay, or ""web wallets,"" which are inherently unsafe, and as well engage in annual reporting against their own user base.  I do recommend the below as methods to safely obtain or exchange BTC.

a) [Storj](https://storj.io/) - Run the client / rent your drive, uses your free connected external or internal HD as available storage, people pay you for it.  (You can exchange the storj tokens for bitcoin or other money)

b) [Electrum](https://electrum.org), [Mycelium](https://wallet.mycelium.com) - examples of easy to use and secure bitcoin wallets that don't involve sharing or giving control of your information to ANY company, ever.

c) If you are into helping the bitcoin network improve and develop:  [check out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6bkk3c/by_request_how_to_signal_uasf_a_guide_for_dummies/) for how to ""signal UASF"" which is a way of individual users indicating that they are 'voting' for the activation of Segwit across the network. [What is Segwit and what are its benefits?](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)

d) [Bitsquare](https://bitsquare.io) or [Mycelium LT](https://mycelium.com/lt/help.html) - decentralized methods of exchanging one currency for another with someone else, these don't require you use banks, organizations, or middlemen.  It's just software.  Your data is in your hands, not the banks' or the governments'.  (Check the site's github periodically for new releases.)

e) [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org) -- decentralized marketplace, no fees, just set up a store and make money.  P2P alternative to ebay or amazon.  (Check the site's github periodically for new releases.)

f) [Mycelium Gear](https://gear.mycelium.com/) - Probably the best way to handle payment processing if you need to set that up and don't want to worry about KYC/AML and insane regulations and fees.  Customizable for your website.

g) [Rein](https://reinproject.org/) - Decentralized freelancing.  Get bitcoin for small freelance jobs without tying yourself to freelancing sites.  Multisignature escrow, no fees.  Yes, really.

h) If you have a Wordpress site I recommend the [Bitcoin Payments for WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bitcoin-payments-for-woocommerce/) which also requires you use WooCommerce plugin. Both plugins are free.  This is compatible with the [Electrum wallet](https://electrum.org), which you will need if you are going to use that WooCommerce plugin.  It works in such a way that if someone gives or pays you in bitcoin then the funds are sent STRAIGHT to your Electrum wallet, not passing through any organization, bank, institution, company or anybody.  Just straight to you.  No mess, no fuss.  Kind of like Mycelium Gear for your Wordpress site.

i) If you liked the above please also check out [ABIS](http://abis.io) which is a project of mine.

*If you have done the above and feel ready to try out a centralized exchange, do not leave your funds on the exchange for any longer than is necessary in order to conduct your business and don't use any exchange that has had any record of a security compromise involving theft of bitcoin.

Four of those attending have direct links to the current incumbent of the White House. A list of attendees – and a brief summary of topics – was posted online by the Bilderberg Group on Wednesday night, just before the conference began.

Wilbur Ross, Trump’s Secretary of Commerce, is on the list, as is the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, his deputy chief technology officer.

National security advisor H. R. McMaster is also attending, along with National Security Council member Nadia Schadlow.

Republican senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham as well as Virginia governor Terence McAuliffe are also due.

They will be accompanied by Bilderberg regulars like Henry Kissinger, IMF boss Christine Lagarde, and former EU boss turned Goldman Sachs banker José Manuel Barroso.

George Osborne, the former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer and now editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper, is also attending.

Although writers and executives from the Financial Times, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal and numerous European publications attend, no internal accounts of the meetings are ever made public – and Bilderberg claims not to keep any records of what happens inside.

Protesters often gather outside the meeting, and have been met in the past by a strong police presence.

Conservative journalist Lauren Southern was arrested last year while trying to report on the gathering in Dresden, Germany.

t3_6eu8gw,After Reading the Paris Accords....,"Some highlights: 

-Each member nation sets their own goals for reducing greenhouse gas. 

-There is no enforcement or pressure to meet those goals, or to not change them at any time. 

-China agreed to cap their emissions... in the year 2030. But in the meantime, the US and other top developed nations will pay $100 Billion dollars per year, every year, to a fund that goes directly to the least developed countries (now we know why China wants the US to stay in the deal). 

-The USA emits 18% of the world's greenhouse gas (2011, Wiki) 

-China 22% 

Any country (The US) can set any environmental goals it wants without the Paris Accord, without paying billions of dollars per year when we are trillions of dollars in debt, and meet any goals we want to set for ourselves.

**Solar and wind turbine are not greenhouse gas free or economic. Gov't subsidies (our tax dollars) are what keeps them on the market. 

The only C02 neutral power source is nuclear power. Right now China has 37 nuclear power plants online with 20 under construction. By 2030 they will be in perfect position to reap future emission reduction rewards. France is almost entirely on a nuclear grid, with 58 reactors.

But when we look at it in the long term does it have any real benefits? When I hear something good about this, is that it helps to improve the own agricultural sector as domestics companies can compete more easily. An anecdotal example I heard is e.g. that in a region of the Caucasus domestic apples aren't bought, because Poland sells them much cheaper, thus this industry isn't growing (enough).

In my opinion it's a bad idea, because it decreases the purchasing power of the people which already don't have that much of it. And even if it would increase these sectors, in every rich nation I know of agriculture is rather unimportant GDP wise.

t3_6kx0rb,Who Would Win - Universal Basic Income vs Universal Basic Math,"**hint: it's math**

So there are about 325 million people in the United States. Just to keep the math simple, let's call that 300 million. What would a good UBI be? Call it $10k? Well that's $3 trillion dollars. 

For those who don't keep track of such things, the total [federal budget](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/federal-receipt-and-outlay-summary) is about $3.7 trillion. Not including Social Security and Medicare, $700 billion is spent on [Welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States#Congressional_funding). So, you'd increase the federal budget to $6 trillion. That's a 62% increase. 

That money has to come from somewhere. And even if you increased federal tax revenues by 62%, you'd still be increasing the federal deficit because [revenues are currently less than expenditures](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/federal-receipt-and-outlay-summary). So to stay deficit neutral, you'd have to increase federal taxes by 71%.

So clearly $10k per person is too much. So let's make it $5k. Well, that's a little more realistic. It's *only* $1.5 trillion. Once again deducting the savings of $700 billion and you're *only* adding $800 billion to expenditures. (To put that in perspective, free college would cost something like $200 billion.)

See, here's the problem: There are about [100 million Americans](http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/terence-p-jeffrey/354-percent-109631000-welfare) currently on Federal Welfare (not counting SS or Medicare). They currently receive about $700 billion in aid. So that comes out to about $7k per person. Even if we say, what the hell, $50 billion of that is spent on government overhead, which is crazy when you consider [education is $70 billion](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/), but what the hell, I'll give you $50 billion in government overhead. That just knocks it down to $650 billion spread over 100 million which comes out to $6.5k per person. Still more than the $5k UBI. And $800 billion less expensive.

So here, let me some this up nicely for you: UBI would increase taxes dramatically and cut benefits to the poor. 

If there's something I'm missing, be sure to let me know in the comments --as rudely as humanly possible Im sure-- so I can correct my post. Cheers!

t3_6mfufe,If a country devaluates its currency in order to increase its exports. How come this can be translated in cheaper exports?,"I mean. If you devaluate your currency, the other countries are still going to be paying for your goods the same amount they paid before devaluation. And sice you devaluated your currenccy, your domestic market is going to face inflation, so you will have to pay (lets say) double the money you used to pay before... So now, by means of commerce, you have earned a currency that is valued the double that your home currency is, but now you will have to pay double in home currency, or the same amount of external currency for internal goods, than you did before devaluation... So how come that competitive devaluation is worth it? I really can't understand it.

Investopedia says this about it:

<b>when the exchange rate is EUR 1 = $1.40, assume a European exporter sells a product in the U.S. at $10, which is equivalent to about EUR 7.14. If the EUR subsequently falls to 1.25, the exporter can slash the price of the product to $9 and still receive the equivalent of EUR 7.20 because each dollar now fetches more euros.<b>

Imagine you start with a country with 100 people, 50 of whom are available for work (employed + unemployed) and 50 of whom are not (retired, students etc). Now if two retired people emigrate and instead two working-age people immigrate, now you've got 52 people who are available for work and 48 who are not. If productivity has stayed the same (and assuming both of these new guys find a job) then you've registered 4% growth purely on the back of demographic changes without requiring any actual growth. 

One way to account for this demographic effect is by computing [PPP / size of labour force (employed and unemployed)](http://imgur.com/a/j06tc) instead of PPP / population. European economies seem a lot more similar to each other in that measure. Interestingly, UK lags behind quite a bit in this measure, suggesting that a lot of the ""growth"" in the UK may have been due to emigrating pensioners and immigrating working-age people. Italy and France are pretty much neck and neck with Germany. United States is significantly ahead though. Poland is catching up fast. Based on data from World Bank.

t3_6u99t1,Creating a dynamic economy system for a game.. (need economic advice),"The game is open world, players can buy certain items and sell others.

Players also have the ability to get items from the world itself (picking berries, killing beasts etc..)

I would like to set an economy that would encourage players to vary their means of gaining money over time, so at one moment in time red berries would be the go to for money, until over time people mechanize berry farms and the price of the berry should ""drop"", causing another item to become more popular.
So changes should be gradual and prices linked to the production of items.

I have devised a system quickly but I don't see it as a perfect system..

I have made a system that calculates every 4 hours the item that is bringing in the most money into the players pockets.
So the money it brings in is equal to ""amount of items sold"" x ""price of the item""
This is compared to other items and the sell price of the items bringing in the most money are set to go down, at the same time, items are chosen to compensate, random items that aren't selling (I still need to add a comparator to check which ones are selling the least/making less revenue) 
Those items are affected by a raise in the sell price.
I am looking to create a stable economy with prices that don't change too much but just enough to change how players make their money.

Items are categorized in categories and sub categories, so high end prices won't be affected by low end price changes.
Each subcategory will contain produce that can be farmed differently from the other subcategories, ex: black berries and strawberries are farmed similarily, so in the same subcategory.
When an item from one subcategory is heavily exploited, it randomly chooses an item from a different subcategory of the same category.

t3_6veqr0,New economic downturn?,"First off, I am not an economist (I'm an engineering consultant who happens to invest a lot). There, I've said it. I'll also say that economists have a pretty awful record when it comes to predicting economic downturns.
I'm starting to feel a little uneasy about the UK economy for several reasons (not just Brexit) and have carried out some research. Some of this research has lead me to believe that even worse problems are appearing in the US and China as well.

My reasons:
A few large housing construction clients have recently started delaying payments to My company (and others) and have even written this into all new contracts. Looking at the financial statements of these companies has shown that they hold a disproportionate amount of property in London. A potentially related issue is that house prices in London have stalled (and reversed in some areas). A deeper look at the UK economy shows that the UK House price / earnings ratio is currently 5.73%, a 2nd only to the all time high in mid 2007 (that date sounds familiar). 

Quick research:
I then looked at UK personal debt and you guessed it, currently running at an almost all time high of 126% of income. Therefore it is not unexpected to find that consumer spending is almost £60,000,000,000 more than the consumer disposable income. Personal savings are currently 1.7% and have dropped significantly since last May (possibly to cover gap between disposable income and spending).

Before I lose every bodies attention by spouting numbers, I should note some of the reasons behind the 2007/2008 recession:

-Low interest rates meaning more people believing they can afford homes out of their reach

-Government backed mortgage schemes

-Lax regulation of lending

It is worth noting that in the UK at least, these are all true. Low interest rates are leading to high inflation and must rise eventually. The government ‘help to buy’ scheme has increased the potential for risky lending. The regulations for lenders are much firmer than in 2007, but in the last budget some of this was reversed.
I have not considered other countries in as much detail, but have noticed the US housing market has effectively stalled (I’m not sure about the historical performance of this and should look at it again in the future). China’s economic data has been taking a downward turn for many years, which is a bad sign, especially as its debt to GDP ratio is increasing fast.

When will it happen?
Large economic downturns are often caused by a bubble in a market (i.e. housing, fad companies etc). A few potential hazard areas to look out for could be:

- Car finance market is vastly overpriced and could burst at any time

- housing market (again)

- tech company bubble. Are facebook, twitter, etc worth anything (never mind the Billions they are listed as)?

-credit / storecard lenders. It’s worth noting that Provident are massively struggling at the moment and might well go under (caused by unrelated circumstances, but may be a trigger).

As I said this is just my interpretation of the data and I may be finding correlation that is not relevant. If anyone has a better insight into this, or knows more about economics than I do, I’d be happy to hear your opinion.

And I will quote from Politifact:

""*On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion,"" the Gateway Pundit website reads [ [read it here](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/08/another-record-president-trump-cuts-more-us-debt-for-a-longer-period-of-time-than-any-president-in-us-history/) ]. ""On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office!*""

""**The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury.**""

And then they say, and I quote:

"" *""Considering that Trump hasn’t enacted any fiscal legislation, it’s a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels,"" Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us.""* ""

"" *""Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns,"" he said.*"" ""

t3_6xk2y9,How to fix the minimum wage problem,"Stop raising your prices. Simple. Sounds stupid, sounds dumb but if nobody raised them, including the manufacturers  maybe just maybe there wouldn't be a need for more money for minimum wage. This includes anything bought/rented including the average value of homes.

Also 2nd solution

This kinda is similar to the top. Let's say milk is 5$  and minimum wage is 10$. Milk raises to 5.25, then 5.75 and all the way to 7$. Minimum wage goes up to 20$ and milk raises it's price to 14$ and continues to increase.

Price lock most goods so they can't be raised after a minimum wage increase. The ""We will loose money"" argument? Well that won't really hurt most businesses especially larger ones like Walmart where they have enough to support such a change. Like what, 140 billion per year as profit? You don't need that much money especially if it's being stored and not spent. Basically, it's better used elsewhere.


I'm just saying that there are solutions even if they're not perfect. I know some one will call this stupid, some may agree, some may have good simple arguments and others will have bizarre random arguments that are far fetched trying to disprove this solution.

Please don't be rude in any response and back up any argument for and against these ideas.

Currently the correlation sits at a 0.96 out of 1.00, and it generally stays above 0.50.

The correlation to financials is not a coincidence. First, the financial sector has the highest weighting in the index. Another reason is that the companies in the index, small cap stocks, often rely on financial relationships with the banks within the sector. It is often seen that the economy is as strong as its banks. In order for small cap stocks to do monetary transactions, they need to rely on America’s financial institutions. If they need financing or a line of credit, they go to a bank. Remember that correlation does not mean causation. Banks also rely on the smaller companies for revenue as well.



So, why are these two segments of the market making new highs?

Hope In Congress

The small cap stocks are likely making new highs because of political hopes. Since the Trump Administration released its tax plan, the markets are hoping that congress will be able to get tax reform done. It was a major promise of the Trump campaign, and it could really help the economy, but there are many investors that are waiting to see if anything will get passed before investing their cash. Since healthcare reform has failed to make any strides towards “repeal and replace”, and an infrastructure bill has not been passed, some investors caution that tax reform may be facing the same hurdles. If tax reform can get done, we may see stocks move up quickly, especially the small caps and financials.

Interest Rates

The rise of the 10-year treasury note means that the financial companies can charge more to lend capital to individuals and companies. Mortgages, business loans, even credit cards become more profitable as the 10-year treasury moves up.

The interest rate for borrowing capital is determined first by the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate is usually the rate an investor can receive on a T-Bill (Treasury Bill). Interest is then added on to the borrower, based on the amount of risk the lender is taking. They will consider risks such as the amount of money borrowed, the time it takes to be paid back, and the borrower’s credit score.

While the T-Bill is not completely risk free, it is considered risk-free because it is backed by the US government. Because the government can print money as it pleases, it is very hard to see a reason why it would not pay back its debt. The only reasons could be because congress fails to raise the debt ceiling and the government defaults on its obligations, or if the US government disappears. Of course, no one is expecting the US government to disappear anytime soon. Since defaulting is political suicide and highly irrational it is not likely the government will fail to make its payments either. The ramifications would be so large, and hurt the world economy, that it makes no sense to default.

Unfortunately though, today the debt ceiling is used as a political weapon. In fact, because politics have made it hard on borrowers, credit rating agencies in 2011 downgraded the US from an “outstanding” borrower to an “excellent” borrower. This affects more than the US government though. Because the government needs to pay more interest, the risk-free rate has risen, making borrowers pay more as well.

Why Are Interest Rates Rising?

Interest rates change for two reasons. The first is that the Federal Reserve can influence the treasury yields, causing the risk-free rate to change, thus changing the rates on other forms of borrowing. Secondly, bonds are traded just like stocks, but bond prices move inverse to interest rates. What does this mean? If an investor wants to buy a stock, they pay up to purchase it, and sell down to sell it. To buy a bond, the buyer pays a lower interest rate, raising the price of the bond, making it more enticing for the seller to sell. If an investor wants to sell a bond they must raise the rate to lower the price of the bond, in order to entice buyers.

The Federal Reserve

The Fed has been raising rates on a path to normalization. After the financial crisis, the Fed needed to keep interest rates near zero. They did this because the economy was on the brink of a depression and it needed as much help as possible. In fact, they did more than just keep the Federal Funds rates low, they also started a program called quantitative easing (QE). This was a bond buying program which gave bonds and the bond market added demand, thus raising the money supply and lowering interest rates. Now, the Fed feels the economy is strong enough to withstand a more normal monetary policy, and they are slowly moving rates back up. First, they began to move rates up by raising the federal funds rate, which is one of their major monetary policy tools. It is the interest rate that banks charge other banks to lend cash overnight. The federal reserve raises this rate, and it in turn raises every other type of interest rate in the US financial markets.

In September, the Fed announced that it would begin to lower its balance sheet. The balance sheet is the amount of assets and liabilities the federal reserve has, and it rose to more than $4 trillion after the series of QE programs they ran. For a comparison, the Federal Reserve balance sheet was around $800 billion prior to QE. As they slowly start to lower their bond repurchases, they are inevitably creating more supply of bonds and less supply of money. This in turn, causes interest rates to move up.

The Bond Market

The bond market is also causing rates to rise because there is less demand for bonds. US Treasuries are bought and sold around the world. This is because they are still seen as the safest of the haven assets, and because they had a positive yield in a world of negative yields. However, as the international and emerging markets have started to grow again, haven assets are becoming less desirable. This adds supply to the market and raises interest rates as well. Take a look at the price action of the 10-year treasury yield: 

The 10-year rose quickly after the election of Trump, but as his policies have yet to take place, they began to move back down. If the 10-year yield can make it past the 24 mark, interest rates may continue to rise until it reaches 26.

Conclusion

It seems the financial sector and small cap stocks are poised to start growing once again. The correlation between these assets is not a mystery. Both asset classes rely on a strong economy,and each other to be profitable. The proposed tax reform plans should also help both asset classes because of the effects it would have on the economy, and their balance sheets. A strong economy means a strong consumer. This should drive more sales, and more revenue. Also helping the financial sector is the rise of interest rates. As they increase, financial firms will bring in more revenue, and it will begin to normalize the economy.

Lets say a country prints out more amount of money to pay the debt. What if they secretly pay this to the other country, why wouldnt this just work?

Yea more money will go in circulation, but how would the public or anyone keep a track of increased money in circulation. 

They always say that because of inflation, price get devalue because everyone has more money, but how does that work? 

Most of the general public get their money from jobs/wages, why will the company even increase their wages in the first place? 

Is it because they will notice an increase amount of money they are receiving and thus think its more motivational for worker thus more productive to increase the wages? Wouldnt it be better profit wise to just pretend everything the same, the worker aint gonna complain, cause they wouldnt notice the inflation rise.

Also isnt this a long process, how long does it usually take for inflation to kick in.

I'm a Brazilian psychologist looking to have a more in-depth knowledge regarding a wage floor for skilled workers such as psychologists.

t3_79sqvz,Unintended Consequences of Easy Monetary Policy,"Easy monetary policy from global central banks has done a lot to help the global economy grow after the downturn of the Great Recession. Although the economy has continued to grow, it is not without consequence. This grand experiment that central banks have done is exactly that, an experiment. No one really knows what the consequences  will be with such a policy, and no one really knows when it is time to stop the experiment.

The monetary policy is simple to understand; keep interest rates low, and liquidity high. Interest rates are a tool that central banks have to either help boost an economy or slow it down. Typically, central banks will lower interest rates to help spur economic activity, while they raise them to slow it down.

In theory, lowering rates should help spur economic development because it makes it easier for people and companies to borrow money. They then use this cash for economic activity. Vice versa, if interest rates are raised, it makes borrowing costlier and thus slows down economic activity. Since the Great Recession was so drastic and harmful to the economy, interest rates were brought down to extremely low levels and for an extended period of time.

Not only were interest rates lowered to unprecedented levels, quantitative easing was used to increase the money supply. Quantitative easing was another response to the damaged economy from the Great Recession. In order to decrease interest rates in bond markets, central banks began to purchase large quantities of bonds through the open market. This in turn lowered rates along the yield curve, and increased the money supply. With more money in the system, it increases the supply and lowers the cost of borrowing. This in turn should increase the demand for cash, using simple supply-and-demand theory.

Now, all of this easing is bound to cause market reactions. For one, there is artificial demand created by central banks in the bond market. There is also a massive amount of liquidity in the market because of the large amount of money supply. And lastly, suppressing interest rates for such an extended amount of time can also pose a problem.

Artificial Demand for Bonds

Artificial demand for bonds means that the prices for bonds have raised, and investors have gained from it. With the central banks around the world inflating the asset, they are also drawing more demand for the asset because they know the central banks are helping the returns. It is like having insurance on your investments. In the beginning the Federal Reserve was basically guaranteeing that rates would go down, and your investment would rise in value. All of this demand for bonds pushed prices up, and made them more expensive.

This has also helped raise the prices of stocks that have higher dividend yields, and stocks that are linked to interest rates. For example, demand for utility stocks have grown and pushed up their valuation. When interest rates are low, utility companies have less costs associated with running their businesses and this helps grow their balance sheet. When interest rates are higher, they have more costs, and their balance sheet weakens. So as interest rates lower, the stock prices go up, but when they rise, the stock prices lower. Also, since these companies typically pay out a dividend, investors are looking to these companies to supplement the lack of income they are receiving from bonds.

When the artificial demand goes away, it will inevitably lower bond prices, raise interest rates, and cause losses for bond holders. What is worrisome is that there are now products that guarantee daily liquidity for an illiquid asset. Bond ETFs can be a problem in a time of panic. Why might there be a panic in the bond market?

A 30 plus year bond bull market may be coming to a halt. In 1981, the 10-year treasury rate was above 15%, and in July of 2016 the rate fell to 1.49%. Because of such a long market run, a lot of investors may not know how to handle a fall in their bond investments. With the inclusion of ETFs, investors can jump ship much easier than traditional bondholders, so they are more likely to do so. This will make their impact swift and painful, causing larger losses. Seeing large losses on bonds can make the other investors jump ship as well. As investors start to jump it will raise interest rates more and more until demand comes back.

For stocks, the higher interest rates are going to hurt the utility companies, and it will cause lower stock prices. The increased demand for dividends will also shrink because investors will eventually want to leave the higher risk asset class in stocks, and they will want to move back into fixed income.

High Liquidity

Higher liquidity has helped push all asset prices higher, stocks and bonds. When this liquidity starts to vanish, it should have the opposite effect, and prices should lower. This should mainly effect the bond market though since central banks are using it to add cash into the system. The stock market does have high valuations, but they are not inflated like the bond market. Sure, utility stocks will likely take a hit as well as inflated dividend stocks, but the strong economy makes an argument for the above average valuations in the rest of the market.

Suppressed Interest Rates

In the Austrian school of economics, suppressed interest rates are seen as a terrible thing. The idea behind it is that since interest rates are so low, investors and companies are willing to take on more debt than they otherwise would. This in turn will cause bad investments because borrowers have such an easy supply of cash. Eventually these bad investments, which would not have been funded during a normal interest rate period, will fail and harm the economy in the long run. Now central banks say they are being careful, and do not necessarily see a lot of bad investments taking place. However, a look into auto-loans shows an eerily similar picture to the financial crisis.

Millions of cars have been sold over the last few years. In fact, there have been record breaking sales numbers over this time period. However, when you look into the loans themselves, there are an alarmingly large number of investors that did not qualify for the loans. These sub-prime loans were the cause of the housing crisis, and now there is a buildup of them in the auto-loan sector. Sure, this time it may be different, for one cars are not as big of an asset as housing, but this does give some sense of how persistently low rates can lead to bad investments.

The Unintended Consequences

In the end, all we can really say is that interest rates are going to go back up. Unfortunately, we cannot claim that they will go up fast, slow, or somewhere in between, and we cannot predict exactly how policy normalization will affect the markets and the greater economy. Using our assumptions though, there are two main takeaways. One, bond investors are going to lose money as rates go up. This could cause panic, especially now that ETFs have become a factor. Two, utility stocks and dividend paying stocks are likely to take a hit from the rise of interest rates as well. Utility companies will lose profit from the rise of rates, and dividend paying stocks will falter because bonds will eventually look more attractive to income focused investors.

Only time will tell if the low interest rates will cause bad investments, but this experiment of easy money will be looked at for generations to come. Just like the Great Depression, the Great Recession will be looked at for its faults and its glories. Economists will look back at this time period and will decipher the causes and effects of all of the policies that have been implemented, and whether or not the outcomes were worth the risks. Just as the Federal Reserve and economists everywhere learned from the Great Depression, the Great Recession will hopefully prepare us for the next large economic downturn.

t3_7aj1pk,My thoughts on the Corporate Tax,"Apple has a shit ton of cash, I think they have the most out of all the companies. They make a lot of it outside of the US too. From my understanding, Apple  doesn’t bring their money back to the US to avoid taxes. Something about LIBOR allows them to keep their money in places like the Bahamas where it isn’t taxable. Now if you look at apples financial statements, you’ll see that they borrow a lot a lot of cash even though they have a fuck ton of it. They are able to borrow cash at rates so low due to their credit rating, it makes sense to use the borrowed funds to finance their operations rather than bring their own cash back to the US to get taxed. Here’s the thing though, companies like Apple, will borrow funds at an insanely low rates and then lend it back to people like the US Government at increased rates. 


Here how I see it, tell me if I’m wrong:

I don’t think lowering the corporate tax will solve that many problems. The US government is competing with a regulation free, very efficient market (LIBOR). Companies always  have found loop holes in government regulation. Maybe he solution should be to patch the holes? The trickle down economics is a nice idea, but the Apple examples proves that when left up to the companies, they would rather get richer while taking advantage of people with less.

Why not save even more – for example, the billions in EU structural funds that go to Poland and Hungary, since those two countries refuse to take in refugees?

Budgetary policy shouldn’t be used to impose political penalties. The structural funds are for making weak regions more competitive. And a large part of every euro the EU gives Poland comes back to Germany. The Poles use the money to place orders with the German construction industry, to buy German machines and German trucks. So net contributors such as Germany should be interested in the structural funds. From an economic perspective, Germany isn’t a net contributor but a net recipient.",2,0.63,1515585515.0

t3_7pxm6v,The problem is not Capitalism but unregulated Capitalism which has happened since the 1980s,"The problem we seem to have at the moment is people choose between the worst aspects of capitalism and socialism. The socialists seem to think we dont need the rich but they fail to realise the reason we have most our technological products are due to the high risk high reward system we have. The capitialists seem to think that the system will look after itself and it will come to a natural medium. But this is not what happens. The people at the top pull up the ladder behind then to stop other from gaining in order to become super wealthy. 

In order to stop this more regulation should be introduced to stop this happening. It would only take a small bit of legislation to improve the economies. One example i thought of is if all companies have to meet certain percentages of payments made to employees. ie. the bottom 90% of employees must be paid at least 50% of the total remuneration paid (ie wages, shares, bonuses, etc) to employees. So this would allow the lower wage employees share in the success/failure in a company. The employee would be paid his/her normal wage and would recieve a bonus at year end. This might mean a bonus of 5k at the end of the year and would allow each employee feel like they made an impact to the company (which they would have). This just stops huge bonus payments paid to the top few people. The top people still get substantially rewarded due to the work that they have done but are not overly compensated and all employees are rewarded.

This would cause a huge multiplier affect in the economy and each person would feel more loyality to their company. This is just an example so I have not included all benefits or drawback this may have but I think it would have a huge effect. This would increase growth in the economy by 5% in its first year as money is now circulating around each local economy and not just the banks or financial institutions.

I know this is not going to solve every problem but it will definately help. I know this system would need to be introduced in a nearly all countries for it to take full effect but we need to try something else. I know they may be problems with this method and I would like to recieve feedback and see what other regulation could be introduced to help the 90% not just the top 10%.",84,0.79,1515773880.0

t3_7ueybq,In some key ways the US economy really is booming. I'm a trucker and I'm tracking the number of loads and the prices paid to move a truckload. Details within. What is going on?,"Here's some hard data I'll walk you through.

https://www.dat.com/industry-trends/trendlines

DAT is a loadboard - an online system for shippers listing loads and truckers picking them up.  These charts show how many loads there are needing trucks.  The number of loads needing to be moved compared to truck availability is WAY up - 138% over this time last year for dryvan.

A dryvan trailer is a big empty plain box.  Reefer looks similar and can haul most dryvan loads, but it has a refrigeration unit up front and it's own fuel tank underneath, plus it's insulated.  A reefer trailer can do food and medicine in addition to whatever normal ""dry goods"" would for in a dryvan...however a reefer trailer weighs 5,000lbs more so done heavy dryvan loads don't work with a reefer trailer.

Flatbed means a flat trailer with no walls that you strap shit to.  They're somewhat tied to the construction business.

As the number of loads available for each truck climbs, so does the price.  Right now we're seeing rates in some cases up over $4/mile in dryvan, which is fantastic if you're a trucker being paid a percentage of the load rate :).  Reefer hasn't climbed as much but once produce starts moving come mid-spring or so expect those to climb and dryvan as well as reefers stop competing with dryvan loads.

The prices for shipping started to climb in August but we expected it to drop again like usual.  *It didn't drop much through the holidays* and now come Jan/Feb 2018 prices are still up and trending up even more.

The market for cheap used trucks with nearly a million miles on them are climbing.  This used to be worth about $10k this time last year, now they're running $15k plus as individual truckers snatch them up hoping to pay for them in a matter of two months or less - if they last any longer we're talking major bank.  A guy with a truck like that getting 85% of the load value can clear at least $4k a week and $6k+ is achievable.

t3_7vl028,People are talking about a recession more now. Here are some potential triggers.,"Recessions don't happen for no reason, it's a domino effect of one bad thing triggering another. I'm not an economist, but here are my wild speculations of the ""dominoes"" that could fall during the next recession.


**Finance and macroeconomic trends**

    The Federal Reserve is stuck between a rock and a hard place
*If the fed keeps rates low...*
If they keep rates low, inflation will happen under current economic conditions. This would hurt anyone with bonds or cash.  It would also limit choices the fed could take to mitigate a recession.

*If the fed raises rates...*
If interest rates are raised, businesses will have to cope with a more expensive money supply for the first time in a decade. Banks would reduce lending causing businesses that depend on short-terms loans could go bankrupt… like retail which is already in bad shape.

    Full employment

When full employment is reached, the rate at which the market can grow is hindered because the labor pool is not large enough to achieve optimum growth. Labor becomes more expensive, particularly hurting companies with lots of employees or thin margins. 

    Dwindling savings among consumers

Overbought markets and dwindling savings indicate the end of an expansion and consumer inability to cope with a downturn.

    Immigration uncertainty 

While unlikely, a sudden exodus of millions of people would have a great effect on macroeconomic trends. It could cause a supply shock in the housing market with millions of new homes (rented or not) on the market. Housing prices could drop causing some of the problems we saw during the 2008 financial crisis. Since we're already at full unemployment, the labor shortage would worsen causing necessary jobs to go unfilled.

    Trade wars

The United States is highly dependent on global trade. If large-scale tariffs are imposed or long-standing trade deals break down with no replacement, it would undoubtedly cause massive imbalances in the economy and a sudden GDP contraction. If the US starts imposing tariffs, other countries will too. It could also be triggered by Chinese sanctions if the US launches a preemptive strike against North Korea for whatever reason.

    Government debt is a growing problem

 The gross national debt in the United States is now over 100% of the GDP. In the event of a recession, this limits non-painful options the government can take to mitigate the crisis. Defaulting on the debt or inflating the currency would cause massive capital flight out of the country and the dollar would lose its status as a global reserve currency. Government debt crises cause decade-long depressions, not a simple recession (Greece 2009-current, Japan 1991-2007, Venezuela 2012-current). This typically is not the cause of a downturn, but something that is triggered by a downturn.


**Technology**

    Smaller tech companies not worrying about profit

 A large percentage of tech companies aren't profitable, they're in business to get bought out. Even large companies like Twitter and Snapchat have never been profitable and have been hemorrhaging cash since inception. If the expectation of getting bought out diminishes, it might be harder for these companies to get funding. Since these companies employ lots of high-paid employees, it could easily affect the economy as a whole.

    The profitable tech giants are sitting on piles of money they don't know what to do with

It's too much to reinvest in their own business so they're sitting on it. If this money is mismanaged it could cause serious problems for the overall economy.

    Global backlash against American tech giants

The tech giants have been facing global criticism from governments over privacy, social engineering, and politics. Governments clamping down would could cause a huge loss in market share among some of the most profitable American companies.

    Cryptocurrency is an obvious bubble

 It's unclear how much this will affect the overall economy since it's fairly new and not well integrated with the rest of the economy.

    Investment in automation increases when wages go up

 If automation tech is adopted too quickly, jobs created by the new technology can not keep pace will the jobs the automation is replacing. This has not really happened before on a large scale but is still a concern among some people.

**Fraud**

    Long-term economic expansions allow long-term fraud to go undetected

 Fraud has a tendency to piggy-back on economic success because there's enough money to keep the fraud alive. When markets tighten, the fraud is revealed because there's not enough energy to sustain it.

t3_812shv,Basic Income Budget and Calculations,"Although this is based on the Canadian government budget and calculated based on Canadian data, same could be done for any other country. In Canada, tax credits cost keeps increasing as politicians use it to attract voters. But like tax relief in UK and U.S. it does not really help the people who need it the most. Not to mention the high cost of administration and bureaucracy.

This calculation was done back in 2015 and includes alternative budget and estimates of revenue from flat tax via income tax. Since then proponents of BI have called for Land Value Tax and other common resources royalty as revenue source instead of income tax. 

The calculation shows how a negative income tax can easily be paid as well as a UBI based on the poverty measures per household.

It is still in draft state so the calculations and ideas still have to be reviewed and refined. But here are some summary/outline of contents:

Negative Income Tax (NIT)

* List of formula and variables used for calculating a Negative Income Tax (a mean test type of guaranteed income / basic income).
* Table showing the gradual cutoff under various negative income tax rate. No welfare trap or penalty for working more.
* $50.3 billion cost of NIT under a balanced 50% negative tax rate (using market based measures as poverty measures at 100%, i.e. zero poverty rate) - based on economist Simpson and Hum estimates.
* $217.1 billion is the cost of Universal Basic Income (UBI) treated by household than individual, hence much lower cost than Universal Basic Income paid to each individual adult.

Basic Income Amount

* A sample budget of a single person and basic amount of $1,190 
* Comparing it to Ontario's pilot amount of $1,390 per month for single person.
* Comparison of current tax rate vs flat tax rate of 50% (below Nordic/Scandinavian countries rate) and show how low income earners are still better off, and $500,000 or $1 million income earners increased payment are relatively minor.

Alternative Budget

* 2010-2011 Federal Budget was used to create an alternative budget (with explanation of why that year's budget was used). 
* There are direct savings or funds that can be readily redirected from social transfer related to poverty to a basic income. ~ $80.70 billion.
* At least $10 billion in administrative / bureaucracy savings.
* ~ $29 billion savings from drastic reduction to poverty for province/territories.
* ~ 15.5 billion savings for municipalities.
* Total savings of ~ $135.45 billion without increasing taxes.
* UBI would need strong collaboration from all levels of government to make it work efficiently.
* NIT can be readily implemented now and using the savings identified above, there will be a surplus of ~ $37.39 billion (after free post secondary and Child's BI, which are already included and deducted)
* With UBI (Simpson & Hum estimate), additional $121 billion of revenue would have to be raised. This can easily be done with a switch to flat tax. Although some UBI proponent calls for revenue to be taken from shared resources, land value tax, etc instead of income tax. 
* A non-expert estimate of a very simplistic UBI cost paid to all adults and how it is paid with a flat tax of 46%, currently the highest tax bracket rate for combined Fed and Provincial marginal tax rates (No one is worse off since non-taxed basic income received by everyone more than covers for increased tax rate. 46% is already the top end paid by higher income earners).
* Under the very simplistic calculation and revenue from flat tax, a surplus of `$10 billion is possible. (this is after free post secondary education and improved UCCB s a Child's basic income. $5,000 per child for all families, above current UCCB of ~ $1,900 that is only applicable to poorest family)
* Option for use of surplus towards National Pharmacare (which is estimated to cost $19.3 billion to $22.6 billion according to the Parliamentary Budget Office.
* An alternative option is to set aside the $80 budgeted for transportation in the basic income payout to be pooled and goes toward municipalities infrastructure and free transportation plan. Yes, free transportation like one being proposed in some Germany's city right now can easily be paid through redirection of these funds.
* Free post-secondary cost is ~ $13.5 billion while an effective UCCB to act as child's BI cost $28.5 billion
* A very pessimistic estimate was also done with huge drop in worker's participation vs the likelier 15% seen in various past BI experiments. 
* List of alternative funding options, including Land Value Tax which is said to have complimenting effect of preventing landlord taking advantage of increased income of renters, to raise the rental rate.

The spreadsheet used for the calculation can be seen in the spreadsheet linked below. It is still in rough draft stage so there might still be errors and some parts (especially in the ""Scratch notes of thoughts"" worksheet) have sentence structure that probably still needs quite a bit of work. And dump of ideas that needs to be evaluated to see what is practical.

Feel free to criticize and question assumptions and calculations. Or suggest improvement or share any other ideas you might have.

I work just accross a financial school and the majority of the student just don't understand this pretty simple principle. And I myself can't seem to explain to them in basic words why we do like this (and I shouldn't ffs, the fuck do they learn in this school ?!).
Is there a specific term for that, that I can explain to them simply without loosing my temper.

t3_889crg,"Some good news for Nigeria's state revenue, though its budget announcement is, again, delayed","It was announced Thursday, Nigeria’s State revenue for February of this year edged up by 19 billion naira ($53 million). This was thanks to higher crude oil exports and prices.

Rising oil prices, new foreign exchange measures, attractive yields on government securities, and a tighter monetary policy have made the foreign exchange more readily available and helped contain inflation. Consequently, investors are returning to Nigeria. So far, lots of analysts tend to be optimistic about Nigeria’s economic development. (recommend FuninUSA for more global financial news)

After the recession of 2016, with the country’s economy shrank by 1.58 percent, according to its National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria—which is Africa’s largest economy and easily the continent's most populous nation—will grow 2.1 percent in 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

This year, chaotic fiscal management has meant that its budget announcement has been pushed back yet again. Expected for April 24, the announcement will now come on May 31 since last year's budget was also published in May. But, thanks to the existing limitations of the Nigerian state, the delayed budget may not be so impactful in the everyday lives of Nigerians. ",2,0.75,1522405316.0
t3_8adb98,Zen : A Decentralized Gold/Silver/Copper Monetary System.,"Greetings,

I'm L.

I want to introduce my current research about a Decentralized Monetary System that is based on the concept of Gold, Silver and Copper. I give the system the name of ""Zen"".

The system use 9 types of money:

Gold Ren, Silver Ten and Copper Sen are 3 precious metal Grasshopper shape coin in pure Gold (4.00g), Silver (3.00g) and Copper (2.00g) that have different mechanical propriety according to the fineness of the coin which is usefull for fineness verification. And it can be printed by anyone with a 3D metal printer with the right fineness precious metal powder.

Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen are 3-in-1 cryptocurrency that use the golden ratio (1.618...), the silver ratio (2.414...) and bronze ratio (3.303...) to simulate the supply of physical Gold, Silver and Copper. And where the standard weight (in grams of the cryptocurrency) of a coin unit is calculated at each block and change automatically so each coin always have the correct fineness (% fees) with the possibility to access and recieve any coin with one private key. And it's possible by a global consenus to back the value of the coins to the physical coins (for exemple 1 YEN = 1 REN). And the network will find by itself the best weight for the cryptocoins to satistfy the backing without the need of an centralized Supply/Demande exchange to calculate the value of the coins.

Y-Network, K-Network and J-Network are 3-in-1 Channel Factories build on top of Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen where anyone in the network can melt down their coins to grams and make instant 100% pure grams (zero fee) to any person in the network and at the end remint the grams to standard coins. And the network nodes are station unit called Zen Towers that offer the exchange of all the 9 types of money with providing cellular 5G/Wifi node. And with the offering of physical coin exchange will make the channel distributed around the earth with no centralized hubs/nodes.

In this monetary system, the do(Zen)al base is used for pricing good and services. The dozenal or the numerical base 12 make counting, addition, substraction, multiplication and division of prices easy which make it the most efficient base for commerce and trading.

I will just add a comment that, in the actual computer architecture with hierarchical memory and wire based internet communication. There is a possibility that Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen will fail at some point even with automatic block size (or density) adaptation and channel factories. So if there is an implementation of it in the actual architecture I will see it only as an ""Experiment"". It's a good thing because it will prepare us for the real implementation on the next generation machines.

The Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen need a machine/computer/smartphone/smarthing with pool of fast memristors base memory connecter with a photonic fiber to a pool of highly parralizable and specialized CPU that communicate with other similar peers with an external high bandwidth cellular base wireless communication.

Hewlett Packard Corporation have already made some research about this type of machine. For many years they havent give it a name yet, they call it only ""The Machine"". (I believe because it's my destiny to name it... just kidding HP! Dont take it seriously! Dont sue me! :P).

I give it that type of machine the name of ""Nen"" the same name as the Human Enhancer Technology introduced by M. The decentralized and anonymous high speed cellular internet build on top of Nen including the 3 cryptocurrency the name of ""Zen"". And the decentralized and distributed Global Brain Machine build on top of Nen and Zen, where anyone can share their memories and CPU for grams in a Hashgraph like protocol and where anyone can do anything he can imagined like store or compute data, search, play, collaborate. I give that World Machine the name of ""Den"".

This still in research and development project is open to anyone. We dont believe on Copyright nor any Intellectual Right that need trust to some centralized authority or some centralized believe system. In our believes, we dont have the right to claim an idea the same as we dont have the right a terrotory. The earth os a gift to humanity, we believe that no one have the right to claim it for himself nor claim a part of it. So anyone can join and particpate, suggest their own ideas or modifications or critics, model and print their own metal coin and give review and suggestion.

t3_8a83vc,Tesla missed its Model 3 production target...but investors are still relieved,"Tesla missed its quarterly target for producing its hot Model 3 cars, but investors still breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday that the numbers weren't more disappointing.


 During the last week of the quarter, the electric-car maker produced 2,020 Model 3s, coming up short of its goal to produce 2,500 Model 3 sedans a week, as reported by FuninUSA.


But that number is better than some signs had warned.In its long-awaited report, Tesla also said it will not need an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines, contrary to what many investors have been expecting.


After rising 7 percent before the bell Tuesday, according to statistics provided by FuninUSA，shares eased up and were up 3 percent at around $260 in midmorning trading.


Shares of the electric-car maker are still down almost 18 percent since the beginning of the year, partly on concerns over the company's ability to ramp up production of the Model 3, Tesla's first attempt at a mid-priced car. Anticipation over the Model 3 had helped drive the stock to an all-time high of $389.61 in September 2017.


Tesla produced nearly 35,000 vehicles in its first production quarter of 2018 — a fourfold increase over the previous quarter, the company said. Of the 34,494 vehicles built in the quarter, 9,766 were Model 3s.


The company expects output to climb rapidly and continues to target a production rate of 5,000 vehicles a week by the end of the second quarter.


First-quarter deliveries also set a record, totaling 29,980 vehicles. Of the three Tesla models, 11,730 were the Model S, 10,070 were the Model X and 8,180 were the Model 3.

I was researching the Tariff of Abominations (1828) a bit and it seems that the reason for that is precisely the same as Trump's tariffs.  This might be stretch, but I think you could possibly argue that the Tariff of Abominations was the spark that eventually led to the civil war as a whole some 60 years later, or at least that it certainly did not help.  Do you think it's possible that these newest tariffs could cause a similar catastrophe?

t3_8aub92,Bubbles Bubbles everywhere ...,"Economics is not an exact science. It has many theories and hypotheses from many different types of ideas and philosophies. The reason why economics is not an exact science is because every economist is trying to predict human behavior. In fact, the number one thing you must learn, in order to understand economics, is an assumption. You must assume that the actor in the economic model is rational. So, how can we make precise models when we know that not everyone is completely rational? The answer is, we don't, and that is why there are a number of competing ideologies and philosophies within the study of economics.

One idea that sticks out to me, given the current conditions, is the Austrian School of Economics. These economists felt that too much liquidity, and easy access to capital results in higher risk taking, and malinvestments. The idea is that if it is easy to get capital, then individuals with capital are prone to taking on more risk, without doing the proper research and due diligence required to make a good decision. The incentive to make perfect investment decisions diminishes, if an investor or company only needs to get more capital to stay afloat. 

Since the Great Recession, we have had extremely low interest rates, and extremely high levels of liquidity. Investing conditions have never been easier, and I think this has a direct link to stock market performance, private investments, and alternative investments like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The rise of unicorn companies such as Uber, the high valuation of Tesla without profits, the FAANG trade, and the rise of cryptocurrencies can all be attributed to the ease of monetary conditions. And now, the punch bowl is going to be taken away.

As the Fed starts to raise interest rates and taper off its bond repurchases, liquidity is going to dry up. Markets as a whole, such as the stock market, and the bond market, are probably not in bubbles, but there are definitely bubbly assets. Stocks like AMZN with a 307 P/E ratio, and NFLX with a 206 P/E ratio are bubbles. How can any investor expect profitability to catch up with these share prices in the near future; a recession will come well before that. These stocks are priced for earnings 20-50 years from now, just like the internet bubble was, and I think they will have a similar fate.

t3_8bgb0t,This is the most important level to watch on the S&P 500 right now,"Everyone is looking at the S&P 500's 200-day moving average. There's another key support level that could provide a clearer signal of market distress, according to Mike Dong, top financial analyst from FuninUSA.

If the market does decline further, the most important support level will be 2,581 on the S&P 500. That was the closing low on Feb. 8 and April 2. Any meaningful close below that level would raise a big red flag on the stock market over the near term.

When support and resistance levels are broken, it tends to indicate that the buyers have run out of ammunition or sellers have run out of stock to sell. The asset then sees a major move once those levels are broken. 

As Khan Tsai, another expert from FuninUSA stated, the other thing to watch is the lack of volume in the market. If you look at the ""double bottom"" that took place in 2015 and 2016, both lows were accompanied by a jump in volume. Getting that big jump in volume during the retest of lows told investors that some capitulation had taken place and that the market had finally become washed-out.

This time around, volume did not jump at all. In fact, it was very, very low. That suggests there is not enough fear in the marketplace to create a sustainable low right now.

The likely reason is that investors hope the earnings season will turn things around. If that's the case, they likely don't want to sell ahead of that.

The ""Make in India"" campaign and the country's young demographics will not just draw a better consumption pattern for the country but also push the overall growth rate towards the double digit mark, said Anil Rai Gupta, chairman and managing director at Indian electricity giant Havells.

In the past 18 months, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has implemented two major economic changes on currency and sales tax. (recommend FuninUSA for detailed report on reforms)

However, for another expert on India's economy, the ceiling on GDP growth is due to the country's management of its labor force, since the labor laws requiring government approval for firing anyone from a medium-sized or large firm discourage hiring.

Indeed, according to statistics provided by FuninNUSA，the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.9882 percent at about 6:20 a.m. ET, inching closer to 3 percent — a level not seen since 2014.


Subsequently, yields have mostly followed a downward path on the back of support from central banks, which tapped into bond markets in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008 to boost their economies. 


As the 10-year yield stops following that downward trend, it raises concerns that the positive outlook for equity investment is about to end.


But, above all, as pointed by Mike Dong, chief financial analyst from FuninUSA，the 3 percent level has a ""psychological"" aspect that makes markets anxious. The 10-year note is used as a benchmark for many financial instruments, including mortgages and as a barometer of investor confidence.


So higher rates not only make equities less attractive, but they also signal that the economy is, or could be, at risk. If companies see their margins squeezed, they might be forced to pay less to employees, even lay-off people.


The particular effect of higher rates on mortgages also lowers people's ability to spend elsewhere. Therefore, society is no longer able to spend the way it has been, and this ultimately kicks off an economic crisis.

""If I look what Alibaba is doing and all these they are trying to make a service to the consumer and to earn money. And they are fighting actively against fakes. This Amazon is not doing,"" he said.


FuninUSA reported in 2016 that Amazon had been facing a counterfeiting problem following the e-commerce giant's effort to openly court Chinese manufacturers. Critics said Amazon hadn't put the necessary checks in place to manage the influx of counterfeits.


Amazon's anti-counterfeiting policy, as stated on its website, maintains that the ""sale of counterfeit products is strictly prohibited"" and the ""failure to abide by this policy may result in loss of selling privileges, funds being withheld, and destruction of inventory in our possession.""


But some corners of Alibaba's offerings have long been regarded as a haven for counterfeit products. For example, as pointed by Mike Dong, chief financial analyst from FuninUSA. Its Taobao e-commerce platform was blacklisted by the U.S. Trade Representative for a second consecutive time this year for selling suspected fakes. 


That move drew protests from Alibaba, which said it did not reflect the company's intellectual property protection efforts. China's commerce ministry had responded with doubts over the ""objectivity"" of the annual U.S. blacklist.

US government’s  evaluation of national security has been limited to the aspect such as external investment and enterprise acquisitions, but currently, the scope of examination is continually expanded. The reason is the concerns about the US intellectual property rights may being stolen by China, or the concerns about US companies might transferring the sensitive technology to China, cited by FuninUSA. 

Nowadays, AI industry is booming, both US and China are fully engaged in this area. According to the analyst of FuninUSA, if the US government tries to cut off cooperation between Chinese and US technology companies, the impact would be incalculable. 

Qualcomm, Intel, IBM, NVIDIA, AMD and other semiconductor giants all have a lot of input and cooperation in China. NVIDIA, for example, has the fifth of its business in China, a common practice that helps to nurture local talent and boost sales, reported in FuninUSA news.

Barclays slashed its price target for the iPhone maker for the second time in two months on Monday, as reported by FuninUSA.


In a note titled ""It Might Rain on Buyback Exuberance,"" Barclays put a price target of $157 on Apple, down from $168, representing a nearly 5 percent downside from Monday's close.


The problem it sees is that many people are holding the stock because of high expectations around capital return. Apple said that it will bring back its offshore cash of around $258 billion to the U.S. following President Donald Trump's plan to reduce the tax rate on money repatriated to America.


Many analysts from FuninUSA expect Apple to announce a significant share buyback program and dividend increase. Barclays said that many investors are holding Apple stock in hope of a payout, but the risk is that Apple could give back less than expected, because more money needs to go to acquisitions due to the possibility of weaker iPhone sales.


Barclays analysts said that Apple could return $84 billion to shareholders in addition to the $52 billion left under the current $300 billion capital return program. This could consist of $21 billion in dividends and $63 billion in share repurchases.

t3_8gp41n,"After Snap stock crash, Wall Street analysts see more pain","Shares of social media company Snap plummeted by as much as 20 percent Wednesday following disappointing earnings, and Wall Street still sees room on the downside.


The company significantly missed revenue estimates in its latest report and said its next quarter year-over-year revenue growth rate will ""decelerate substantially."" according to report from FuninUSA.


As a result, multiple firms published bearish notes and knocked down their price targets for Snap's stock.


Morgan Stanley dropped its price target to $8, about $6 below where the stock closed Tuesday, and remains underweight. Snap was trading at $11.45 on Wednesday morning, down nearly 19 percent on the day.

Analysts at FuninUSA were ""skeptical"" after the results, projecting an $11.50 price target. It cited leadership and said competition from Instagram could add to the pain.


Analysts at Deutsche Bank were also bearish, keeping a $12 price target with a hold rating.


Credit Suisse dropped its price target from $21 to $16, still above where the stock was trading Wednesday. While its analysts called the quarter ""conviction-testing,"" they maintained their outperform rating.

The iPhone maker reported $13 billion in revenue from Greater China during its second fiscal quarter — a 21 percent year-over-year spike, according to statistics provided by FuninUSA.


The company's performance in China is particularly impressive as overall smartphone sales were down in Q1, according to Mike Dong, analysts at FuninUSA.


But Tim Cook wasn't buying the bearish view of China.


China is one of Apple's most important and competitive markets, and one that has increasingly been in the geopolitical spotlight amid trade tensions with the U.S.


Apple has faced increasing pressure to innovate as China's domestic brands, like Huawei, Xiaomi and OPPO have gained popularity and moved toward higher-end handset specifications.


Apple also reported strong revenue growth in Japan, posting a 22 percent year-over-year jump, as reported by FuninUSA. Revenue out of the Americas grew 17 percent; revenue in Europe grew 9 percent; and revenue in the rest of Asia Pacific grew 4 percent.

Amazon disclosed in its latest quarterly report that it had $12.4 billion in backlog revenue for Amazon Web Services. As reported by FuninUSA, the balance represents the total value of signed contracts that didn't get reported as revenue because the agreements run for multiple years.


On average, the remaining life on those contracts is 3.2 years, which means Amazon has over $12 billion of sales that will turn into revenue over that stretch, according to statistics provided by FuninUSA.
  

The new disclosure is the latest sign of AWS' maturity as a software business, expanding from a pay-as-you-go service for smaller startups to a multi-year contract model that targets enterprise customers. The increase in backlog revenue gives investors a clearer sense of the strength of the business.

Though Walmart remains king of sales with $495.8 billion in annual revenue and U.S. sales of $318.5 billion (a 3.5 percent increase year over year) for the fiscal year ended in January, Amazon is growing at a faster pace in the United States.


According to statistics provided by FuninNUSA, Jeff Bezos' company boosted GMV from $141 billion in 2016 to $186 billion in 2017, a 31 percent increase year over year.


The company recently announced that it would raise prices for its premium membership to $119 from $99, a move Wall Street applauded as beneficial to its revenue base.


Amazon's stock is up 37 percent so far this year, well ahead of the S&P 500's 2.1 percent gain over the same period; the stock is up 66 percent over the last 12 months.

Amid fears of a global trade war and rising tensions between the world's two largest economies, both China and the U.S. have entered bilateral talks to bolster cooperation. 


Just a day ago, both countries were sharply at odds over a claim, that China would move to cut its trade deficit with the U.S. by $200 billion annually, according to FuninUSA. 


The trade imbalance has long been a thorny and intractable topic in the Sino-US relationship. Commerce Department data recently showed that imbalance between what China buys from the U.S. and vice versa hit a record in 2017 at over $375 billion.


As pointed by Mike Dong, chief financial analyst from FuninUSA, China is a major source of demand for U.S. farmers, who have agonized over the fate of key agriculture exports in the wake of the trade dispute.


Still, Beijing and Washington agreed to ""meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports. The United States will send a team to China to work out the details,"" the statement added.


The two countries also agreed to expand cooperation on areas such as manufacturing and intellectual property — one of the stickiest disputes between the U.S. and China, given the latter's lax enforcement regime. In March, Trump slapped $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, in retaliation for what it alleges is rampant IP theft.

Borrowing costs have gone up over the last few weeks, with the yield on both the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and the two-year bond reaching multiyear highs last Friday, as reported by FuninUSA. Higher yields, which move inversely to bond prices, pose a risk for equity markets.


At the same time, the difference between long and short-term borrowing costs keeps narrowing, in what investors describe as a flattening of the yield curve. This indicates that investors see debt that is to be repaid in two years being nearly as risky as lending it for 10 years.


In a normal, functioning economy, lending in the short term has fewer risks — the underlying thought is that you can more easily predict what's happening tomorrow rather next month.


The most influential central banks across the world are set to slowly end the era of cheap money, by increasing borrowing costs. Ultimately, this could exacerbate the problem of higher yields even more.


Amid expectations presented by experts from FuninUSA of a storm in equity markets and higher short-term yields, Mike suggested investors should exit the equity market.

Businesses in China are set to spend an additional $835 million on advertising ahead of the World Cup, according to the report from FuninUSA, a platform offering products reviews and global news.

Though the Chinese didn't qualify for the soccer tournament, coming bottom of their group during qualifying matches in Doha, Qatar, last September, Chinese advertisers have been aggressively bidding to establish their association with football this year.

Among all, the dairy company Mengniu is one big Chinese advertiser. It will provide the World Cup's ""official drinkable yoghurt"" in China, as well as other products, and will air commercials in 64 World Cup games as part of its deal of signing as an official FIFA sponsor in December.

In recent years, China has increased the awareness of fostering talented football players. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a big soccer fan, and has previously stated that he wants the country's team to win the World Cup. He's also said that he'd like China to host the tournament and intends to bid for the 2030 event, written in FuninUSA news.

The World Cup provides a reliable boost to the global ad market every four years. This year, the game will be responsible for about 10 percent of all the growth in ad dollars. ",3,0.72,1528598724.0

t3_8rd1dc,Isn't capitalism a deficient system for our future ?,"I'm not an expert but this question has always interested me a lot. So i need some answers.

If we talk about the future of mankind.

imagine that in the future like in 5018 

Every goods and services will be automatized and made by robots. chirurgy or even eating at the restaurant. 

Then what will humans do for work ?

in the perfect future world we will all be :

Making research in :

Science, Robotics and logistics.

However if we are more than 7 billions how the hell will the economy transform ?

what will you do with more than 7 billion people if they don't need to works anymore ? 

They will all be researchers meaning that equality will be finally be something getting close to be true.

If capitalism stay strong it will mean that the industries and big lobbies will not allow this evolution !

you're asking me why ?

well it would mean that if we become all reseachers the ones which will get the biggest remunerations would be the one which are the most beneficial for the societies and not the most productives. 

If the states of the world would let the future robotics lobbies too keep being private compagnies it would be too dangerous they would control the world. Those companies at some point will be nationalized....

So what will billionaires  do ?

They will risk to loose their privileges. And they will do everything for this to not happen.

If we stay in a capitalist system. The future of mankind will be submited to more inequalities and we will perhaps even finally end in a world controled by a bunch of bilionares.

if we move away from the capitalist system we will have new companies specialised in medical scientifical and logisitc research. There will be more competitivity than ever and evolution will be faster than ever.

So if we get to the point where everything will be robotized wouldn't capitalism be a deficient system anymore ?

Wouldn't we better be in a system where states control the production and research reducing the risk of robotics lobbies getting over the world ?

I'm not talking about a communist system which has proven to be deficient but isn't there a best of both worlds between those 2 systems ? they have both good and bad things.",9,0.84,1529085948.0

t3_943hhp,Debate: How important are the (working) poor to our society?,"How important are the (working) poor to our society?

What do a cleaning lady, a supermarket cashier, a temporary worker and a hospital janitor have in common?

They do jobs nobody wants to do.
They buy and consume things nobody wants to buy and consume (second-hand clothes, low-quality food, used cars and electronics).
They use services nobody else wants to use (watching soap operas on TV, spending holidays in motels and youth hostels).
They allow society to spend money in an alturistic way without being outright beggars (by claiming state support and consuming surplus money).
They occupy housing nobody wants to occupy.

But wait, I know some middle-class or even rich people who do one or more of the afromentioned things. How can you say this?

There are only few middle-class or rich people doing the above. And they all do this because of their personal beliefs. They wear cheap clothes because they deem them to be the most comfortable ones and use second-hand cars or buy used laptops because they want to do the environment a favor by decreasing production need. Poor and working poor people do the aforementioned things because they need to, having no other choices due to their low financial, cultural and social capital.

While this may sound nonsensical, consider the fact that low-quality goods, jobs and services are not always created ""on purpose"" to target the poor but often as by-products of high-quality goods, jobs and services. Every pig carcass contains fatty or tough yet edible meat that can satisfy one's hunger. Every baker needs somebody to oil the oven. Every busy doctor, engineer or lawyer needs somebody to clean his home while he and his wife are working and the kids are in school. Everybody who wants to take a walk in the park needs somebody to collect the leaves. Every exclusive penthouse building has at least one crappy, small, oddly-shaped, damp and dark apartment nobody wants to have. Every good car becomes worthless after ten or twenty years, still working and driving swiftly and reliably but showing honorable scratches and indentations. Every famous screenwriter will start his career producing proletarian plays.

While universities are becoming more and more cramped, vocational schools training for lowly-paid, repetitive, ""ordinary"" jobs are being closed due to lack of interest.

As long as robots will not replace menial jobs and replicators will not allow everybody to magically materialize every desired item or food, the problem will persist. The poor have no other choice than to mitigate its implications by consuming what others might consider waste - in contrast, many academics rather stay unemployed for years than taking up simple jobs and gourmets go hungry for a day instead of eating fast food. It's all a question of personal mindset and values, of hereditary factors and upbringing.

The middle class is expanding in some countries. In short metaphorical form: servants are now demanding servants by themselves. Fewer and fewer people are there to serve more and more people.

It might sound inhumane, capitalist and ignorant, but the poor, and especially the working poor are and have always been the backbone of our society. They are not the waste of the society but the cleaners and janitors of the society, taking care of its waste.

In my opinion, not only the theory that the middle class must expand indefinitely, ultimately absorbing the lower classes is wrong but also the downfall of the middle class in countries like America is a natural symptom of its oversize.

Russia's holdings in U.S. debt securities have decreased by 84% since 2017. Russia currently holds $14 billion worth of U.S. debt bonds, bills, or notes.

""Even at Russia's recent peak of $105.7 billion in November 2017, Russia only ranked as the 15th biggest foreign holder of US debt. China owns about $1.2 trillion -- or roughly 10 times as much as Russia” - meaning that Russia’s debt dump would not be moving enough volume to distort the credit market.

It must be noted that investors should not be too worried that the Russians sold these assets fearing that they would not get their money.

The leading theory, [courtesy of CNN](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/30/investing/russia-us-debt-treasury/index.html), is that this is Russia’s way of retaliating against the U.S. for its sanctions against Rusal, a Russian aluminum company that produces 7% of all of the aluminum in the world, and against several Russian oligarchs.

t3_963gar,"If you look at economic growth compared to the changes in the labor force, this cycle has actually followed the historical trend.","GDP per capita is more of an ‘apples to apples’ comparison than just looking at GDP, but it doesn’t go far enough. Because America is getting older and fewer young people are working, the labor force participation rate has cratered. Therefore, it’s best to compare the average GDP growth on a per labor force participant basis.

The growth rate from 1955 to 2007 and the growth this cycle are both 1.7% per year.  The growth rate is only slightly below the trend line. Before you get worried about a recession, the growth rate usually gets ahead of the trendline at the end of the cycle and then it falls below the trendline during the recession.

t3_96ujdt,Bitcoin Volume as a Bellwether to Unrest in Turkey,"In the words of Confucius, “if you study the past, you define the future.” While this statement can be made applicable for many aspects of life, in none does it ring truer than political unrest and revolution. From protest in the streets to economic turmoil, political unrest (no matter where on earth you may find it) can shake the world’s socio-political and socio-economic pillars through and through. Furthermore, like the infamous Arab Spring and many other uprisings, political unrest and economic turmoil almost certainly lead to a change of power and regime. This sort of unrest can now be seen first-hand in many regions, however, it is the uprising in Turkey that should truly capture the eye of global governments and citizens alike, as it has quickly become a crucial turning point for the once theoretical concept of the use of Cryptocurrency as a state-wide currency, despite there already being a standard Fiat currency in Turkey – the Turkish Lira.

For over 15 years now, Turkey’s Erdogan has lead the nation with the Iron fist of dictatorship in both the Prime Minister (2013-2014) and Presidential (2014-Present) positions. In June of 2018, Erdogan won his latest re-election with a vote of 52.4%. Despite this number (and the election in general), has been called corrupt, unjust, or fixed by many within Turkey and around the world, Erdogan had continued to coral power throughout the region. Furthermore, although Erdogan may be extremely powerful within Turkey, his blatantly dictatorial actions have made him a pariah on the world stage and has led to super powers like the United States imposing harsh sanctions on the nation.

While Erdogan’s poor leadership and dictatorial mindset can certainly be blamed for the current economic downfall of turkey – with the Turkish Lira losing value at a current rate of 3.3889-6.6870 Lira/USD in the past year alone – it can certainly be said that the sanctions (and warning of sanctions) by the United States has been far from helpful for the nation’s desperate population or chaotic state. Although such economic hardships and downturns almost never affect the elite / ruling class, the every-day-Joe Turkish citizen is suffering greatly under an abusive regime, a failing economy, and the restrictions that come with a 9.6% unemployment rate throughout the nation. Furthermore, while many citizens may want to protect their assets by investing in foreign currency as the Lira falls, Turkey’s Erdogan has recently called for all citizens to sell their foreign currencies in an effort to prop up the Turkish Lira – stating that the government will confiscate your money when we find it.”

So then, what might be the solution for the Turkish people? Their economy is failing, their nation is being hampered by international sanctions, and they’re living their lives under the thumb of an extremely oppressive regime, how might they help (or even save) themselves? Most Turkish citizens seem now to be turning toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for financial security and relief. This flood of cryptocurrency is not unique toward Turkey however, in fact, through analysis and comparisons of both cryptocurrency exchanges and Forex pairings, one may note the sudden influx of cryptocurrencies in places like the Korea, Poland, Russia and Turkey – which makes sense, as all of these places are seeing some level of unrest amongst their populations.

If seen as a store of value, rather than a viable money-making investment, (which, in reality, is what Bitcoin should be seen as and is), one might ask the question: “Why would people who feel safe / secure with their nation and its economy need to store their money in anything other than the currency of the country?” Furthermore, once the cross-examination of cryptocurrency markets and Forex markets are accompanied by news reports of injustice and civil unrest, it may become extremely clear what’s going on in these nations. Furthermore, this may be used in the future as an indicating factor for civil wars – as usually economic downturn turns the military on its leaders and a coup begins, especially if the people are on their side.

While such links are, for now, theoretical, as time unravels the fate of Turkey’s current dictator, it’ll undoubtedly be extremely interesting to see how cryptocurrencies may continue to play a role in either the potential regime change or whatever else might come. After all, when looking for clues one should always “Follow the money”.",2,1.0,1534126863.0

https://reddit.com/link/999m2d/video/y7svkowj6kh11/player

​

I saw this come across my feed & it smelled funny. It makes a good lesson as an example of propaganda.

​

The Cato Inst. is a Libertarian Think Tank founded by Charles Koch.   And in the great tradition of capitalist swine they are and using  deceptive marketing / propaganda, they are comparing apples and oranges.

That 1954 model was the first year color TV's came out.  And it is a  floor console model, so a much bigger housing that you are paying for as well.  In 1954 the RCA B&W 17"" Tabletop cost $189.

So if they really want to compare flagship to flagship, let us look at  something like a Samsung 2014 50"" 4K TV, which started at $2499 back in  2014.

Clarification: 1954 was the first year RCA had a color TV out, which is the one the meme seems to be showing.

In 1951 CBS Mechanical System had one out for $499.

t3_99wqhl,What is behind the decentralization reform in Ukraine?,"Is the decentralization reform in local self-government in Ukraine a necessary measure adopted by Poroshenko since the signing of the Minsk Agreement or is it a consequent change based on the need to “protect the village”?
More than three years after its start the decentralization reform in local self-government remains relevant. The Ukrainian authorities affirm that this reform is the most efficient (or one of the most efficient) reform of recent years. They add that the efficiency of this reform has already been demonstrated in practice. The budget for the already established consolidated territorial communities (CTC) has increased significantly. The financial decentralization in Ukraine is, indeed, successful, for example, the budget for 2018 for the Berezovsky territorial community in the Odessa region exceeded UAH 61 million (it was UAH 23 million in 2017). Today the implementation of social programs and the improvement of infrastructure have become a reality thanks to the financial decentralization. 
Of course, not everything is as smooth as we would like. Well, yes, the territorial communities’ authorities distribute the budget but it is up to Kiev to determine the funding allocations for each consolidated territorial communities (CTC). So, formally “decentralized” Ukraine becomes more unitary. CTC leaders are forced to navigate, they seem like honest defenders of their communities while remaining loyal allies of Kiev’s officials. In fact, the prosperity of communities depends on Kiev’s subsidies and grants. 
There is another weak controversial point. It’s the establishment of consolidated territorial communities (CTC). According to the reform, from 1.5 to 1.8 thousand communities are planned to be established in Ukraine by 2020. By the summer of 2018, nearly half of the plan is implemented, but is it possible to realize it within designated periods? The process seems to be delayed indefinitely. By enacting a law on “A voluntary consolidation of territorial communities” on 5 February 2015, the Verkhovna Rada actually itself signed up to it. It’s worth saying that some regional and district officials aren’t interested in this reform because they are scared of losing their job. They sometimes slow down the documents flow and mislead the population as to the real advantages of the communities’ establishment.  
Moreover, agro-business representatives militate against this reform. The state land registry began to transfer lands outside built-up areas to consolidated territorial communities (CTC) on 1 February 2018. This process was started by the Ukrainian government. It ordered farmlands in public ownership should be transferred to community ownership of consolidated territorial communities (CTC). So, with the creation of consolidated territorial communities (CTC), the business connected with unaccounted lands can collapse. 
But, despite all of the failures and shortcomings in carrying out this reform, it can’t be underestimated. The optimization of the management system is necessary for further development of the country in general and rural areas in particular.

t3_9dcqer,From a static economy to capitalism,"Suppose there's a village whose residents all produce the amount they need to consume. There are trades happening in a way that someone can satisfy all his necessity by trading all the goods he produces in exchange to the goods of his fellow villagers.

Now, if I am an outsider and bring a new product to this village, and it really interest them, they would need to abstain from buying and selling something if they are to buy something from me.

At the end of this transaction, nothing happened to the GDP of this village. No new value were added because these people had to sacrifice their consumption in order to buy something from me.

This strikes me as kind of unintuitive. How an economy like this would become a capitalist economy that produces constant GDP growth?

The only way I can think of is if the mere expectation of a new product coming (like they predicted I would show up with a new product) already generated new labor to come with an income that could buy it without sacrificing current consumption.

t3_9e3pgy,I think I've identified a new economic phenomenon...,"So I think I've identified a previously unidentified phenomenon in economics... And I call it ""The Investor Cycle""...

So basically, it goes something like this: Investors look for appreciating assets to buy low and sell high... When they find one, they add to the demand, and bid up the price of the asset, making it appreciate even more, attracting more investors, who do the same, and so on and so forth... This causes exponential run-ups in price, until the price of whatever asset it is, reaches a high that is just ""too risky for investors"" and then the appreciation stops... At that point, investors decide to sell, but sadly, most of the demand for the asset was investors, so, when they all decide to sell, there is no one to buy, and the price plummets... When it gets low enough, investors will then begin to buy again, re-inflating the price, restarting ""The Investor Cycle""...

So this is basically a ""boom-bust"" cycle, but mentioning the ""investor incentive"" in it all... And there's also the matter of ""trade volume"", but as I like to say ""available supply, vs demand"", for instance, when all of the investors decide to sell, there will be a LOT more supply available then demand, while, on the contrary, as the asset is appreciating, there is a lot LESS available, since all investors are holding onto it while the price is going up, which FURTHER increases how fast the asset appreciates, since a whole lot of people are competing for it, and there is a very little supply...

t3_9i7wcb,Turkish Unrest and Bitcoin Volume=Regime Troubles," 

Citizens when they are witness to economic unrest in their own countries usually begin to buy foreign currency and keep it in reserve against the devaluation of their own currency. This is normal during troubled times, and we were beginning to see the same thing occurring in Turkey. However, Erdogan thisa number of weeks ago called for all Turkish citizens to sell their foreign currencies to prop up the Lira. This sort of a call is usually code for “we are going to confiscate your money when we find it” so you better sell it now, as well as a tacit admission that the Lira’s value is in serious trouble. Thus, the economy as well.

In my opinion due to the tacit threat of monetary confiscation we are now seeing a flight to bitcoin and this is also a clue to the unrest that Erdogan is dealing with. Why is this problematic? Since Turkey can’t confiscate currency that is online and untraceable. We can see the flight to Bitcoin by comparing Forex crosses against bitcoin volume.

In this light we can see a trend whereby that out of the top 8 Bitcoin traded countries/currency (USD, JPY, EURO, GBD, KRW, PLN, TRY, RUB/RUR) only 4 (USD, JPY, EURO and GBD) are in the top 8 Forex pairings. The others are minor currencies.

The Top 8 Forex crosses are:

EUR/USD 37% of total volume

USD/JPY 13% of total volume

GBD/USD 12% of total volume

AUD/USD 6% of total volume

USD/CHF 5% of total volume

USD/CAD 4% of total volume

EUR/JPY 2% of total volume

EUR/CHF 2 % of total volume

Based upon the comparison between the Bitcoin and Forex Volume we can conclude that there is a feeling of unrest in Korea, Poland, Russia and Turkey. Why put discretionary cash in bitcoin if you feel secure! Add to this the protests, negative economic indicators and international isolation and we can conclude that Turkey is ripe for unrest and the citizens wanting regime change. This does not mean that they will succeed as Erdogan controls the military. However, as we have seen in the past (example the revolution in Egypt) once the upper echelon of the army personally starts to feel the economic results of its leaders’ policies and the people start to demand change, the military almost always sides with the people for their own self-preservation and the betterment of the country they serve.

Anyway, he was chatting to me about how we only have **2** top tier technical support guys in our company on one of our main tool lines. 

Let me put that into perspective, my company is massive, you own a product made with our machines.

Go to any mall, and ask if they are hiring, see how quickly they pull out a job application. I play a game with my wife to find the one mall store that isn’t hiring. 

Neither of us have won yet.

At first, I was laughing at these signs. I’m a millennial and I reached adulthood during the recession and it was a petty revenge. Now that I see them everywhere, and with higher and higher starting pay and in bigger, brighter banners. It’s making me a little nervous. They stopped looking like irony and more like caution signs.

How are we going to keep innovation, or even basic maintenance of the variety of infrastructures both real and virtual, if all those with the skill and the knowledge are on the cusp of retirement?

t3_9k8czv,Change My Mind - Advertising is Bad for the Economy,"I've had this lingering thought floating around in my head - that advertising is bad for the economy as a whole. The more I think about it, the more it makes sense to me. But maybe I haven't thought it out properly - so prove me wrong (or right)!

Here's the thought: a free market is supposed to thrive because it's a hyper-competitive landscape. Good products thrive and sub-par products wither away and die because consumers decide to buy good products over bad products. 

But advertising seems to throw a wrench in things. It's very possible for a sub-par product to do well because it's marketed well. People buy what they see advertised, not necessarily what is the best value for their money. It seems like advertising is specifically trying to diminish the competitive landscape that an efficient economy requires.

Further, the more a company advertises, the more they have to pay for advertisements. To recoup these costs, they have to raise the price of their products. This makes their products an even worse value. 

I imagine a simplified world where all companies advertise equally. What would be the point? All companies are spending a lot of money and have to raise their prices to pay for advertising, but no company gets an edge, because they're advertising equally. It's as if none of them are advertising, but they still need to raise prices. Surely this is an inefficient way for an economy to run. 

On the other hand, I've heard the argument that if advertising increases sales, the marginal cost of making new products may be low enough to pay for the advertising (and then some) without raising prices. On the micro scale, this makes sense, but this also suggests that one large monopolistic company is the most efficient way to produce products (we all know this isn't true). And what if all companies are advertising? Then will advertising actually increase sales, or will all companies just steal sales from each other and net out somewhat equally?

Then, there's the argument that advertisements are good for the economy because they spread information to consumers about what products are available. I agree that spreading information about products is important. But isn't there a better way to do it? The information from advertisements is necessarily (for the most part) biased towards one specific product. Many people prefer to get information from unbiased sources who rank various products, such as Consumer Reports, CNET, etc, etc. This provides information about products while actually increasing the competitiveness of the market. Maybe these sources are enough (or could be enough) to spread the information?

So help me out. Is there anything I'm missing? Has anyone else had similar ideas? Prove me wrong!",4,0.75,1538329805.0
t3_9ko79g,How much of modern economy is make believe?,"I am an avid Eve Online player, for anyone who has not played that game, it is a space simulation MMORPG with a very mature market economy. Recently, I ran into a prompt in game, something like ‘are you sure you want to make this wasteful action’, my immediate reaction was, ha, my action in game is nothing more than flipping some bits in a database somewhere, how stupid of the game to use the word wasteful to describe any action in the game...  

5 seconds later, I was like, fuck, almost everything I do in real life is the same, my bank account is just a bunch of bits in the bank’s database, my employment to me is nothing more than my name in the payroll which sits in a database somewhere in my employer’s premise. I can go on for another 20 examples, but you get the idea...

To think more of it, everything in the Eve Online economy (goods themselves, ownership, production) is no more than a couple of bits in a database, but the economy in game is almost identical to the modern market economy, as a matter of fact, a lot of economy major graduate students and even professors are studying the in game economy, and some think that the in game market is indeed an economy (satisfy whatever vague definition of economy). Obviously, since everything is fake (again, bits in a database, whoever having write access can modify them at will), it is a make-believe economy in the sense that participants believe that in game goods and items are valuable.

The real life market economy, on one side, is very different from the in game economy, food is being produced, and they are essential to every human being, so is water, basic shelter and clothing. But there is undeniably another side that looks exactly like the in game make believe economy, tulip mania is a good example, fancy jewelry, cloth, or a lot of luxury items seem to fall in this category as well. Individuals may have different opinions regarding what is actually make-believe in modern economy, but a consensus that blings (Ferrari, very fancy bags, diamond jewelry, ..etc) are in general only valuable to people who agree that they are valuable.

So here comes the question, how much of the economy is this make-believe economy, at which point does economy transition from satisfying human survival needs to a game of make-believe?",3,1.0,1538460254.0

While several companies, including Filecoin and Storj, are already working on decentralized file storage, Bluzelle is targeting the databases that keep data quickly and easily accessible for websites and applications to pull from.

These databases make the internet more useful for interactive tasks, such as updating weather and stock prices. And Bluzelelle wants to bring that flexibility to the decentralized web, which is currently as slow as molasses.

So-called structured data gives websites and apps faster access to data they can read, change and be updated externally. And following the interest by investors to fund what they call ""protocol tokens,"" there seems to be consensus that now's the time to be investing in this specific protocol.

Bluzelle sold 33 percent of its total pool of 500 million crypto tokens to 7,058 people and organizations.

In other words, people with and without mental health difficulties can take part. We hope the questionnaire will be able to highlight areas of employment support for the person in returning to work.

For everyone who takes part, the study will donate £1 on their behalf to their choice of three mental health charities(Young Minds: Child & Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, or Rethink). So far we have had 918 people complete it, which means we have raised £918! We are hoping to raise over £1000 to mental health charities :)

Sure this is unethical, VERY unethical. No one denies that, but i am curious how this system can continue exist underneath this enourmous debt, with no real collateral or assets backing them up. Save the government and that is no guarantee. The system is literally hemorrhaging cash left and right, and isnt really serving a real purpose anymore. More and more people are forgoing treatments until its too late and too costly further adding the debt load. There is a doctor shortage, and we have a whole generation of old americans who need care. Where is the money coming from for that?. Who is financing that?. I seriously doubt there is any answer there. 

Its a total mess, and i fail to see how it still functions at all. Where does there money come from?. And why?. Also this seems just from first glance a serious financial crisis in the making perhaps more serious than the subprime mortgage crisis. Its honestly that bad, like i said. Its possible the government is keeping this system on its feet. But the costs are just so out of control and spread out that not even the government can reign it in. Obamacare only put a bandaid on the issue, forcing everyone to get insurance, was supposed to reduce the debt load, and pump more money into the system. But the core problems remained. 

Stagnant wages, aging baby boomers, doctor shortage, corruption of the system, and so much more is honestly just causing this massive shitshow to falter. Obamacare slowed its death down, and i think the lack of a public option is what has caused this to not be fixed. At the risk of sounding poltical washington made a big mistake when they didn't include the public option. For many reasons i hope are obvious here.

Greed us the underlying issue here it really is. Companies are exploiting customers and workers as much as they can to make a few more dollars.

See you can raise wage minimum wage but the cost of everything is going to scale. That's just a given fact. The more money people make in an area the more basic things are going to cost. Why would companies want to make less if their sole purpose is to take every dollar you have?

Over time ever so slowly prices rise and products get more expensive. That's without minimum wage ever changing so you have prices rising by themselves and also adjusting to the new minimum wage. So it's like you never got a raise and everything got more expensive.

t3_9xbd5f,Bitcoin crash: Crypto investors are trying to save their funds,"The safe harbour of cryptocurrency has eventually sunk under the volatility wave, which triggered a massive collapse of all crypto coins. During the peak of this decline, market capitalization has shrunk by $30 billion. During the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s price has lost almost 13%, trading at around %5,500.

&#x200B;

On the morning of November 15,2018, the second largest global Bitcoin wallet, which belongs to the Binance exchanged, moved out 109,234 BTC ( $600 million at the current exchange rate). Considering this huge sell-off in the past day, the news in regards to such a big move of almost all Bitcoins from a “cold” wallet may reinforce negative dynamics in the market. It is worth remembering the sharp reaction of the market, subsequent to the sale of BTC and BCH by the Mt.Gox bankruptcy trustee Kobayashi.

&#x200B;

The lever near $6,000 was defended by bulls for months and the decisive hit of this mark is a bad signal for the whole market. The altcoins suffered even more: Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) lost almost 13%. It is noteworthy to note that in the recent days, BCH has attracted consumer demand due to the hardfork prospects which can split the chain, as it was in the case with the original Bitcoin. However, the fierce confrontation between the two camps advocating a different future for the project, frightened even the speculators. It is very unlikely that BCH sell-off had started before hardfork.

[According to technical analysis](https://fxpro.news), the next important stop could be the area of the previous price consolidation: distant marks near $3,500. A well-known crypto investor, Barry Silbert, has the same opinion. He considers what is happening now as a “cryptocurrency capitulation” due to a deep disappointment in the prospects and falling interest from traders and users.

At the same time, the ambiguous and often negative position of the American regulator is an additional pressure factor.

t3_9xmnid,Three major falls of the week,"The past week has been stigmatized by three major falls on oil, bitcoin and the pound. However, this trio seems to have managed to return back to stability.

**1. Oil collapsed on Tuesday.** WTI fell by more than 7% on that day, which was the 12th consecutive steady decline, making it the longest series in modern history. OPEC ministers failed to promise a reduction in production, while the Joint Technical Committee forecasted a production growth. The whole situation has caused major panic in the markets. Since Wednesday, oil has been steadily recovering, but it has not yet managed to fight back to even half of Tuesday’s decline, not to mention the whole 28% collapse.

**2. Bitcoin experienced a crash on Wednesday.** Many months of sluggish dynamics turned into a sharp sell-off, when the key cryptocurrency fell under the $6000 mark. At the end of the week, BTCUSD was traded near $5500, which roughly corresponds to the cost of electricity required for its production.

t3_9yqrej,Markets moved from irrational exuberance to anxiety,"The US dollar continues to develop a rollback from the multi-month highs, falling to 96.0 on DXY while triggering [EURUSD](https://www.fxpro.com/trading/forex/eurusd) to reach a two-week high, at 1.1450. Nevertheless, dollar’s rollback does not help any other assets, and although the weakening of the dollar usually sets offs growth in the stock and commodity markets, this is not the case this time.

On the U.S stock markets, we see a continuous sell-off of stocks of high-tech companies. Nasdaq Index had lost 3% on Monday, and at the start of trading on Tuesday plummeted to lows seen back in May, subsequent to the decline of stocks of market giant such as Google, Amazon and Apple. Pressures on Apple shares have plummeted the company's capitalization by 16.5% since the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, Facebook lost 40% from its peak values in the middle of the year and sank to low levels, which we have not seen since February 2017.

&#x200B;

Powell's words in regard to the potential pause in the rate hikes induces a pessimistic sentiment in the market participants about resilience of the economy. Demand for U.S. Treasury bonds was on the rise. The words of Fed’s chairman were perceived as a signal that the Central Bank is not as confident in maintaining such a strong rate of economic growth.

With an exceptionally strong economy, growth stocks had the highest demand, and with the economy growth rate close to the trend levels, the focus of investors shifts back to the company’s performance. Under these circumstances, markets shifted their attention to the long-term average P/E ratios, in which the highest rates were in the IT Sector.

&#x200B;

It is logical to fear that the correction of high-tech companies might spread to the entire stock market. It happens most of the time, but one should not rush to conclusions.

Based on what we have seen, it can be said that the end of the easy-money era, initiated in early October, resulted in the realisation of a more realistic view of the markets. This was manifest not only in the shift from growth stocks to value stocks, but it was also very noticeable in the dynamics of Crude Oil (-25% of October’s peak value) as well as in the Cryptocurrency market (-30%). Markets are on the way from irrational exuberance to anxiety. However, we cannot exclude the case that emotional sales may drag indices low on an emotional sell-off, throwing them to the other extreme, fear, in the upcoming weeks.",3,1.0,1542707274.0
t3_9z27j3,The overnight market decline seems to be the sum of individual stories,"Assets that have shown great performance last year, have again went through another strong decline.

Yesterday, Nikkei fell by 2.2%, back to 7-month lows. On Tuesday, DJI had lost more than 2%, subsequent to the decline of the shares of the energy sector, throwing the index back to October’s lows. It seems that for the last month, positive drivers are struggling to push the market to a sustainable trend for growth.

Crude Oil experienced a sharp and unexpected reversal to a decline on Tuesday. Intraday [Brent Crude Oil](https://www.fxpro.com/trading/energies/brent) dropped by 6.5% while American [WTI](https://www.fxpro.com/trading/energies/wti) lost 7% on Tuesday, exactly the same percentage as one week ago. Markets are fearing that the slowdown in the world economy will slow the growth of oil consumption, nevertheless production is significantly increasing. Oil drilling in the United States is growing, and thus the American WTI is experiencing a great deal of pressure, falling to lows seen back in November 2017, while Brent is at 8-months lows.

&#x200B;

But there are a few things that allow us to remain optimistic about the stock markets, at least for a while. The “Fear Index” VIX has been fluctuating around 20, for over a month now. The new wave of declining markets, instigated on November 09, has not affected the fear of market participants.

The stability of gold prices illustrates the same. Since early October, the gold’s price fluctuations mirror the dynamics of the dollar. Yesterday’s market decline occurred amid the weakening of gold.

&#x200B;

The Chinese yuan retains its strength, showing increase since the beginning of the day, which in turn allows us to talk about a partial drawdown of the market, in which some assets have been declining but others have retained their strength.

On the one hand, such selective pressure may be the first phase of a full-blown correction, and the currently affected assets are the canary in the coal mine of large-scale problems in regard to the growth of the world economy.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, regulators still have the time and experience (we hope so) to make the right decisions in this situation, and in turn resulting in better estimations for the upcoming data. Among the important points to pay attention to, is the slowdown of the U.S. housing market as well as the impact of tariffs on China's growth rates. Data that has been already published force us to think about the risks, but yet does not allow us to talk about the imminent onset of recession.",2,1.0,1542797497.0

t3_a620lz,"We now know why healthcare costs are skyrocketing on the provider's price side (consolidation), but how are providers spending the increased revenues?","There was a professor (from Yale or Cornell I think) that obtained a large dataset from private American health insurers a few years ago. The dataset showed that providers have huge cost discrepancies among the same medical procedures (>10x in some cases) and the professor mentioned that regional M&A of providers leads to monopolies, and that gives, a couple of rolled up hospitals in a rural area, say, huge leverage. There's probably some other secondary inefficient incentives that allow providers to be obscure with prices and bill more codes than are needed. Some growth is also expected from other reasons like inflation, increased obesity, and baby boomers. Also, M&A are also happening on the insurer side and leading to less competition (and higher prices, and easier price fixing). Generally, I speculate health insurance companies don't find a lot of price elasticity and don't want to cripple their provider networks too much. And even if it were elastic (that is, if it's too expensive, Americans become uninsured), the uninsured will just avoid preventative care and make their conditions worse, which may eventually lead to ER visits and more expensive treatments leading to bankruptcy, while the insured now subsidize the bill.  

What's puzzling to me, however, is what the providers do with that additional money. **Where do most of the aforementioned monopoly rents go towards on the provider's side: doctors, g&a, or shareholders?**   

Shareholders: The healthcare sector substantially outperformed the general market over the past decades, but it the best fit polynomial line is much steeper when looking at premium increases (just from a quick glance).  

Doctors: Of course, if one finds a cash cow, and the cash inflows scale with doctor-hours, and the demand for these doctor-hours increases (while the supply of doctor hours is fixed), one has to inevitably entice them with higher pay; it does seem unlikely that they would get the full pie, however - for there wouldn't be a point to the whole arbitrage game to begin with (get more doctors until marginal profitability approaches 0).  

Admin: That's what everyone keeps saying it is, but if that were truly the case, couldn't shareholders do something against executive management as they would be violating their fiduciary duty to shareholders?

At the time I was a young adult trying to get on my feet, but found it nearly impossible to find employment. The reason being, when the economy took a dive, all of those middle aged network administrators, loan officers, etc who lost their jobs got pushed in to the low end, entry level customer service and retail jobs. The person bagging groceries and pushing carts at the marker wasn't a teenaged or 21 year old kid working part time for gas or college money. It was a 45 or 50 year old man with 30 years of experience in some white collar industry, who used to make at least a median income and was now working a minimum wage part time ""kid job"", which they had to be on call for 24/7 just to keep from getting evicted from the room they were renting.

There were job vacancies, but they often had requirements that no one could meet as they typically wanted at least 5 years of experience in an obscure and specific task and were unwilling to train, or certification of some kind that was new and would take a two or three year program to obtain, at which point it would be obselete.

Anyway, through some hard work and a few graces and strokes of luck managed to leave but returned recently for the holidays. I was shocked to find the situation hadn't changed.

Those middle aged men bagging groceries, pushing carts and delivering pizza were now 60+ year old men pushing carts, bagging groceries and deliverying pizzas. 
If their economic situation improved, it was only because they now qualifued for social security benefits.

The jobs they lost almost 20 years ago never returned and they could not move in to new job sectors as they opened up due to lack of familiarity with those industries and concepts, or age discrimination. They never were able to get their middle class or upper middle class status back. It was pretty shocking.

*Note: I only mention men because older women had always been present alongside kids in these entry level retail and customer service jobs in this area.

t3_ab2zgc,Why The Irish Have The Best System Of Number Plates,"Ps.There are 28 counties I think roughly in Ireland and Limerick is one of them just to explain a bit of it


Hi there, I think the Irish have the best idea for a number plates because it’s great for the economy and makes way more people buy cars more. Hope you enjoy!

Ok so an example of a car registration, plate could be “181-D-100” so the 181 bit is the first six months of the year 18 means the year and either 1 or 2 could follow it if it is 2 then it would be (182) the second 6 months of a year. image2.jpeg

The “D” stand for Dublin because D is at the start of Dublin. It could be if the car is registered in Limerick it could be “LK” because the first letter of Limerick is “L” and the last is “K”. If it were any other country such as Kilkenny it wouldn’t be “KY” it’s “KK” because there is another county in Ireland called “Kerry” and that also starts with a K and ends in a Y.

The last bit is simply the place in which the car is registered starting from 1 so usually the President of Ireland would get 1 because he’s the highest in the country then An Taoiseach (aka prime minister) would get 2 and then the mayor of Dublin would get 3. After that the numbers are given to people on the first come first serve basis. 

This number plate is the best in the world as 

A. Everyone wants people to know that they have a new car so if I want to buy a new car then I buy it in the new year. This means a spike in the amount of people who buy a car in the new year. Then at the end of the six months at the star of July there is a huge spike in car sales because guess what? 181 is old 182 is newer! So there is a steady spike in car sales every year. image1.jpegThis is a graph that I “borrowed” from a website and the 2 things that stick out is January and July because this is when Registration plates change and they appear newer. 

B. An example of a car say a Toyota RAV4 selling second hand registered in say Mayo, (now Mayo is the middle of nowhere and there is no one living there so it’s generally not visited so people don’t really appreciate it) said second hand car from eg 2015 would be worth €17,500 (Donedeal figures) and a car of the exact same condition and year registered in Dublin is worth €23,449! Because everyone wants a car registered in Dublin it simply looks good.

C. And last and one of the most important is that the first come first serve style number. As said people like a new car. So if you have a car in a low figure at the start of the year it’s worth more but if you have a high figure at the end of the six months it’s worth more because people are vain

Hi, I’m a big fan of Vox and I am also Irish. And while I was in the car away in my head on the way to Dublin I looked out the window and looked at number plates and I just sat there thinking to myself for a good hour on number plates and I came up with a little essay on Irish number plates I think it could be a good idea for a video cause it’s what I hear, an interesting subject. I am posting this on my little reddit account and I hope you enjoy!

t3_ab2z20,interest payment to cash flow balance sheet models,"So... I'm reading ""Money Culture"" for the first time (I know... old book) and I ran across an interesting reference to [a paper written by Ben Bernanke and John Campbell back in 1988 titled ""Is There a Corporate Debt Crisis?""](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1988/01/1988a_bpea_bernanke_campbell_friedman_summers.pdf) [PDF link]
 
The only reason the paper caught my eye was due to their references to ""equities repurchases"" (financed by debt, dividend reduced/eliminated and redirected CAPEX), in particular the observation of its overuse, 1984-1986, leading up to the crash of 1987.

The entire justification seems to revolve around the idea that buy-backs reducing float while dividend issuance does not.   Additionally, there are contributing factors of the time, namely high interest rates and debt tax advantage, that contribute to the assumption of debt for repurchases.  However, because debt-asset ratios are calculated at book value, there's seems to be an equity valuation blind-side. 

Fundamentally, the conclusion of the paper seems to imply that significant changes in equity price can effectively mark to market mis-valued debt assumed for repurchases during an increasing interest rate environment. 

Accordingly, I'm curious if there is anyone doing any kind of publicly available analysis with regard to debt-asset ratios vs cash flow vs equity valuation.

I'll just close with the reason I want to get a handle on debt service as a percentage of cash flow using a ""word byte"" from Money Culture:

> debt servicing today comprises 26 percent of corporate America’s cash flow, compared with 22 percent in 1982 and 19 percent in 1974. As Professor Bernanke concluded, “The last time we had debt in this range was in the 1920s.”

t3_abpugl,Just wanted to share my opinion on government assisted program. [LONG],"I know for the past couple of years the talk about government assisted programs have been a hot topic and now under the Trump Administration many think he’s trying to get rid of them. I just wanted to share my personal experience and my solution. 

My mom and I moved to America in 2012, first thing she did was enrolled in college like we moved here in June and by August she started college. We lived with my grandfather at first and he didn’t support her going to college, was an alcoholic so he kicked us out in addition to other reason. So my mom was going to school full time studying biology, working nearly 30 hours a week and raising a 13 year old. She was lucky if she had two days in a week where she got more than 5 hours sleep in a night.

Obviously she still couldn’t afford all her bills so we were forced to have food stamp and Obamacare. One think that did stick with me was once we were shopping at the grocery one Christmas Eve and we bought lobster. It was probably our first time having anything lavish since moving to America but it was Christmas. A guy behind us in line saw we were laying with a food stamp card and went off on us saying how we’re taking advantage of the system saying we shouldn’t be having that, if we can’t pay with our own money. I was obviously embarrass and it didn’t help the fact I didn’t even get a present. Anyway I’m getting sidetracked but guy forever stuck in my head and when I was a senior trying to decide what to study in college that guy’s comment made me know what I wanted to do. 

Four years later my mom eventually graduated and got a job with the health department and another job working part time. As soon as we got settled financially she actually got off food stamp and obviously her job came with insurance. We were still eligible for food stamp I think even last year we were because they check income for two years ago. However, despite being eligible my mom decided to work a second job than munch of the government to get her bills paid. While in my community there were people living on government programs before we got to America and if I go back there now they are still probably on it. They stay home don’t work, with the hope of the government paying everything for them. To me that’s a problem, I’m disgusted by it look how hard my mom worked to get out of that situation but there are people who actually make no attempt to get out because it’s free. Honestly I don’t even blame them haha. 

Now I’m a second year Economics major and I just wanted to share what my solution is. Nothing outside the box haha, probably won’t cause a movement or anything but just wanted to share. I feel that government assisted programs should be federalized and not run by states then they should all be centralized into one program, because honestly if you need one your probably need the others. Now I feel these programs should also come with assistance finding a job or investing in human capitals. They can be encouraged to go to school where they can find a career. Now I’m not saying they should pay for school or anything but they should be helped with enrolling and I know some people might think that’s extra expenses but it’s gonna be cheaper than having people leeching of these programs forever. If school is not for them they can learn a trade, in many trades you get paid while learning. Or get some certification of some kind, get a CDL truck drivers are in high demand, a couple weeks you can have your CDL and if you can handle the road and willing to do overtime you can easily make 100K. If a person refuses to do these because maybe they have a degree but got laid, or just has another job in mine they should have a limit of how long they are giving assistance for.  If it’s obvious that they are making no efforts to get a job then take away these programs from them. I feel that a lot more people would stop staying home collecting welfare and become more productive members of society and the money spent on these programs can be spent in other programs. 

Like I said nothing too complicated but just wanted to share let me know what you think of it if there’s anything you disagree about. ",4,0.75,1546403333.0

Am I the only one skeptical of facebook reporting their best engagement numbers in the last several years amid their worst user data scandal yet?

They reported a growth in daily active users (DAU) from the last quarter. But those numbers are calculated internally and Facebook is known to change their formula for calculating that. That leaves a gray area for Facebook to spin those numbers. 

Could Facebook be manipulating their User engagement numbers to boost investor confidence?

But my understanding is, the fact that billionaires are so wealthy is they still own much of the shares of the company they founded when the company has grown. One of the main reasons I hear by hardline defenders of current capitalism explaining this is, it's the CEO who took the risks. But the only risk he took is the initial investment. When the company starts to make benefits and reinvests in itself to grow, this really has nothing to do with the initial investment and the CEO, and yet his wealth grows with these investments, meaning he ends up owning part of these successive reinvestments made by the company, which is a separate moral entity. This doesn't seem right to me, my thought is, his initial shares should be diluted as soon as the company reinvests (1). What are the moral reasons why the CEO retains a flat percentage of the company ?

There are different types - if you want to discuss how laissez-faire economics compares to market socialism, or neoliberal economics vs. mercantilism, you can do that here.

A large percentage of entrepreneurs choose a public platform, Ethereum, as a basis for their services. However, over the years of work of existing decentralized applications on the platform, each user who respects his analytical skills has managed to verify the current number of users of services developed on Ethereum. The numbers, to put it mildly, are not impressive. Perhaps, Ethereum’s technical flaws have become a reason why there is no real use of the blockchain services by the masses. Probably, the wrong choice of platform at the beginning of business hinders the whole process of development of blockchain technology in the framework of modern business.

**What blockchain is suitable for your business today?**  
**Zilliqa, Credits, Aion, Wanchain, Tron** \- this is an incomplete list of companies with unique technical advantages that can turn the current perception of technology and solve the problems of real use of services on the blockchain. Each of the companies seeks to expand its ecosystem. What does this mean?

Projects teams, investor communities are interested in increasing the number of services on platforms, and therefore companies are ready to make certain kind of concessions, bonuses, joint projects if you switch your current application to their blockchain or create a new one there. In addition, blockchains of new generation offer a number of technical advantages in comparison with Ethereum.  
**For example,** [Zilliqa](https://www.reddit.com/r/zilliqa/) has developed the first platform, which uses the technology of sharding to enable increasing throughput as the network expands. To encourage the development and adoption of applications that are built on the platform, team has announced Zilliqa Ecosystem Grant Programme — a pool of $5 million USD that will be given to great projects, teams, and individuals to start building tools and applications for the Zilliqa platform.  
**Another example is** [Credits](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditsOfficial/) **platform**, which offers a wide range of advantages for developers. The first platform advantage is the ability to write smart contracts on widespread accessible Java language, which makes the platform more multipurpose. Another unique features like the speed of transaction processing, low fees, advanced features of smart contract like cycles and schedules make it possible to create Dapps and services for an extensive list of industries without any limitations. Finally, developers of the project provide you with full technical support for implementation of your Dapp or its transition to Credits blockchain, including its further marketing campaign.  
**What else do you need to start?**  
This is a real chance. As competition in the market grows, the demand for applications will increase, which will affect the overall picture of the Dapps economy, in which there will be a place for everyone and probably for you. All you need is to start.

When the last recession hit the US interest rates were dropped and dollars were printed but when this didn't do it, quantitative easing was introduced. This helped ease the pain and with another recession looming the same may be required, this time however there are on going trade wars to also consider. When the next downturn hits could the US reversal of these trade wars not do a better job of stimulating the economy then say QE? Is the potential of reversing these wars not another tool in the US arsenal against a difficult downturn?

With the fed controlling interest rates, would the introduction of a trade war prior to a recession and the withdrawal from said war not have a similar effect on the economy as the rising and lowering of interest rates? ",7,1.0,1554255463.0

t3_ball9r,A Wealth Based Income Tax Bracket,"I’m interested in diving more deeply into the idea of a progressive income tax where the brackets are dictated by current wealth rather than annual income.

I feel like this might be a nice method for helping to stave off wealth inequality in a way that helps boost aggregate demand and the economy, while avoiding many of the pitfalls of a tax on wealth itself.

However, I have been unable to find any instances of this across the world, in literature, or in a relevant historical context.

t3_bbgnif,What if we had a $24 minimum wage but no business or corporate tax?,"What would our economy look like?  Our need for social services like welfare, social security, public healthcare and education?  How would businesses handle it (not would they support it initially, but how would this change the dynamics of their costs/business model)?

My thinking is if everyone made at least $24/hr, corporations wouldn't need to be taxed nearly as much, because not only would there be far less need for poverty-reducing programs, but there would be far greater tax revenue from the middle class.  Realistically, I think it would be like lowering the corporate and business tax rate to whatever you pay making $24/hr (since the money is still getting taxed, just in the hands of employees not the corporation) and on that tax rate's revenue not having to support a huge portion of poverty-reducing programs.  Could we survive on 20% a corporate tax if we didn't have such a need for welfare?

I'm not sure what the real rate corporations and businesses pay, because I know their tax code is so complicated.  I know many of them pay next to no income tax, but I don't know overall rates for both individual companies and the average rate (because certainly some companies avoid more than others, some don't avoid at all).

Meanwhile, our SEK is at is lowest its been ever, according to some sources - and our welfare system is trying its best to keep up with the huge demand. There is also some political instability going on, and people are starting to lose trust in a system that has been taking care of them for a long time.

The dramatic difference in those ratios means that Mexican families have a much more difficult time financing the purchase of homes, automobiles, and consumer goods, and Mexican business enterprises have much more difficulty in obtaining working capital, than their Canadian counterparts. The result is slower economic growth. Little wonder, then, that over 500,000 Mexicans—roughly half of all new entrants to the Mexican labor market—illegally cross the border to the United States each year.

t3_ce07w6,Why is there a bond market rush now with negative yield bonds?,"I've been reading a lot about economics over the past month to try and gain an understanding of it and finance. I've been mostly reading Bloomberg articles and researching terms and theories on investopedia.

In the last day or two there have been a lot of articles about the flood of investment into the bond market and the subsequent amount of negative yield government and corporate bonds. These articles say that it's due to the anticipation of the fed interest rate cuts coming up on July 31st.

If I've understood it correctly there's two linked reasons for this.

1. In anticipation of low yield bonds being issued after the fed cuts rates, investors are buying current bonds with a higher interest rate.
2. As the demand grows for these current bonds, prices rise and therefore yield drops since there is an inverse relationship between the two. If I've understood it correctly this relationship occurs because say if a current $100 bond with an interest rate of say 5% (so $5 a year) goes up to $110 then the interest rate will fall below 5% to match the $5 a year amount. Otherwise investors would just buy new $100, 5% bonds.

But my question is that if the fed is due to cut interest rates, why is money going into the bond market? From what I've read I've gained the understanding that generally as interest rates fall investments migrate from bond markets to the stock market, because A) corporations are likely to increase productivity in lower interest rate environments and B) new bonds will have a lower yield.

Where am I going wrong in my thinking? I appreciate I've read a lot about general trends and there are lots of subtleties. For example perhaps investors aren't looking at the stock market too much due to the current trade wars. Or perhaps this whole negative bond yield situation is a stepping stone to a migration of investment from bonds to stock. Or perhaps the stock market is already priced for the upcoming fed cuts.

t3_cmhe7e,View: Few economic issues that need immediate attention,"Now that elections are over, no one in the ruling dispensation needs to pretend that the economy has not been in dire doldrums for quite some time. There are many severe problems the economy faces, some requiring immediate attention, others more structured long-term policy changes. Of the former, I’ll pick two. 

First off, is the continuing scourge of demand deficiency (and the resultant low capacity utilisation) that discourages private investment. More than tinkering with tax concessions or interest rates, one needs pumppriming public investment on a large scale. The lack of investment is associated with lack of non-farm jobs and massive underemployment and unemployment, particularly among our restless youth (providing the foot soldiers of gangster-politicians and lynch-mobs). 

So, the public investment has to be job-creating — in construction, roads, public housing, warehouses, cold storage, etc. In rural areas, demand has to be boosted through more such construction programmes and by expanding the scale of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) schemes. It’s not really ‘employment guarantee’, as evidence suggests that there is a large unmet demand for such jobs in many states. 

Evidence also suggests that leakages in the original programme have now diminished substantially. This rural programme now needs to be supplemented by an urban employment guarantee on public works and civic programmes improving our crumbling urban infrastructure. 

So, where will the money come from, at a time when fiscal deficit is rising? With relatively low inflation, we may afford to relax a bit on the fiscal deficit goals if money is productively spent on income-boosting construction and capital projects. Besides, India’s tax-GDP ratio has remained low and stagnant even after decades of high growth, while wealth inequality (as measured by National Sample Survey (NSS) data) has now mounted to almost South American levels. 

A large-scale reform of our current subsidies (much of which are enjoyed by the rich and middle-classes), and increase in direct taxes (with current under-taxation of property values and capital gains and zero-taxation of wealth, inheritance and agricultural incomes) can be carried out at a relatively short notice. 

The other looming problem we can’t look away from any more is the water crisis — for both drinking water and irrigation in large parts of water-depleted and ecologically stressed India. Along with immediate and drastic reduction of power and water subsidies, mass mobilisation of decentralised water-user associations in water management and rainfall harvesting is imperative. 

Of the more long-run policy issues, let me flag only a few. Our whole secondary education system has to be largely restructured and channelled to a mass-scale vocational training programme, in partnership with private employers. 

Otherwise, many jobseekers will remain unemployable. In view of our dismal export performance — at a time when Vietnam is picking up the sectors China is graduating from — and the slump in our job-creating automobile and ancillary sectors, renewed efforts at a coordinated industrial policy, particularly in financing and supportive regulatory environment, are urgent. 

In agriculture, where there is a large potential for job-creation in high-valued produce like fruit, vegetables and livestock products, what is needed, apart from investment in rural infrastructure, is opening up all marketing channels, thus disabling the current cartelised markets, and facilitating the widespread formation of farm companies and cooperatives to stem the adverse effects of declining land size. 

The largely wasteful and iniquitous current minimum support price (MSP) policy should be oriented mainly toward millet crops and pulses. All this will require political courage. But that should not be beyond the capacity of our current muscular leadership. 

In a country with one of the world’s largest disease burdens, GoI is pushing Ayushman Bharat, an underfunded and hyped programme of insurance for hospital indoor expenditure for the poor. 

In general, India has yet to debate seriously at the political level why a subsidised private insurance model to cover only about 40% of the population — and that too not for their more substantial expenses on drugs and outdoor visits —is to be preferred to other models of universal healthcare with larger risk pools bringing down costs (as, say, in Thailand or Australia). 

A large number of Indians, even far above the poverty line, face all kinds of brutal weather, health or market-related risks in life. 

To provide some minimum economic security against such risks — apart from boosting the autonomy of women in the family and the fallback option of all informal workers — unconditional basic income supplement for everybody, far beyond PM-KISAN for farmers, should be implemented in phases. 

Finally, administratively, we are retreating from effective decentralisation needed for successful economic policy in a large diverse country. Power remains over-concentrated in the PMO, choking decision points, while Bills impinging on state powers are hurriedly passed in Parliament without consulting the states. All this is making a mockery of the oft-repeated rhetoric of ‘cooperative federalism’. 

Political loyalty and seniority, rather than performance, dictate promotion of bureaucrats, and public sector enterprises and regulatory bodies for private sector operations remain ‘independent’ only on paper.",2,0.75,1565041053.0

t3_cqgy1x,The low interest rate has me worried about all the recession talk lately if things stay true to recent-ish history.,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not an expert on this topic. I'm more a history guy but I think in this situation the history might matter quite a bit. Typically the Fed drops rates to help stimulate the economy in a recession but it's only at 2.25% right now which I think is a big problem if things go south like some people are predicting. For comparison here's some history.

The US first went partially off the gold standard, a.k.a. [The Bretton Woods System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) in 1971 because of lots of reasons that basically boiled down to the US not having enough gold to cover the dollars held by foreign institutions and what reserves we had were being depleted. (Whether you think this was a good or bad idea doesn't really matter in this discussion, only that it happened.) This started a whole series of reactions around the world that soon lead to rapid inflation. Nixon made things worse with wage and price controls and by devaluing the dollar even more. 

The Fed tried to stop this inflation by raising rates but it didn't really work and by the end of 73 the interest rate was over 10% but inflation was over 12%, the Oil Embargo was in full swing, and the country was in a recession. It was [stagflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation). The Fed continued to raise rates peaking at just under 13% in July without it helping the recession or slowing inflation so they changed policy and just went at the recession dropping the rate over 7% in less than a year to around 5.5% and the recession finally ended in March of 75. 

At this point the country was smack dab in the middle of ""The Great Inflation"", the causes of which basically depend on which economist you happen to be listening to or reading at that moment but basically boil down to lots of people being shady, wrong, or both. So the rates went right back up to combat it to no avail. From 4.6% in Jan of 77 to 6.7% in Jan of 78 to 10% in Jan of 79 to eventually over 20%. This brought about a lot of rethinking in monetary policy and changes at the Fed but the modus operandi for dealing with a recession basically stayed the same.

When a recession happened in Jan 1980, possibly caused in part by the changes at the Fed to combat inflation which included a drastic rate hike, the rate was at 14% it kept up for the next few months hitting almost 18% in April then being dropped drastically to 9% by July when the recession ended. Kind of. Rates started back up in Sept 80 and by Jan 81 they were over 19%. This coupled with the high inflation and jobless rate helped usher in a second longer recession that started in July 81. The rate immediately started to drop getting down to 9% by the end of the recession in Nov 82. A drop of 10%!

Rates stayed in the 9-11% range until 85 when they started to creep down. In 86 & 87 they stayed in the 6-7% range with a little drop after Black Monday but not much because, no recession. Then in 88 inflation crept up again and they raised rates a bit to the 9-10% range where they stayed until July 1990 when a bunch of things like the higher rate, the S&L scandal (A direct result of deregulation by Carter), the 86 Tax act, the Oil Price Shock that came from Iraq invading Kuwait, etc. came to a head. But mostly it was just caused by a slight downturn after a period of sustained growth. The rate was dropped from 8.15% in July to 6.12% when it officially ended in March of 1991. Unemployment stayed high though so it continued to drop until it hit 3% at the end of 93. 

That's a drop of just over 5% for a relatively mild recession with some lingering unemployment issues.

At this point the economy was humming. Inflation was low, unemployment was low, so the fed started creeping the rate back up, to keep the economy steady. They stayed in 5-6% range for the rest of the 90's. In 2000 the fed announced a rate hike to try and calm the volatility of the stock market but it was only to the mid 6's when the tech bubble started bursting and had dropped to 5.31% when the recession officially started in March. By the official end of the recession itself in Nov 01 it was at 2% but the economy while not officially in a recession was still pretty bad so they kept dropping it until it bottomed at 1% in 2003. (The argument that this extended low rate, coupled with banking deregulation, helped cause the subprime mortgage crisis is also pertinent. As well as Bush's tax cuts.) 

That's a rate drop of 5.5% for a mid ranged 7 month recession followed by a slower than average recovery.

It eventually got back up to 5.25% by 2006 when the housing bubble started to burst and had been dropped to 4.24% by the time the subprime mortgage crisis brought down the financial institutions and officially started the ""great recession"" in Dec 07. By the end of 2008 the rate had been dropped below .25% making it effectively zero. (During this time Dodd-Frank was passed to try and prevent a recession like this from happening again.) 

That's a drop of just over 5% this time but only because it couldn't go any lower and it had to be kept there for the next *seven years.* 

The economy was fully into it's recovery by 2015 so they started slowly raising the rate back up but by the start of 2017 it was only up to 1%. At this point the fed finally decided to start normalizing the rate with steady increases through the end of 2018. (In 2018 congress also decided to do some deregulating again by gutting parts of Dodd-Frank. They also passed the Trump tax cuts.) 

The economy started to slow a bit, which was to be expected and probably needed to happen, even though this was exacerbated some by our increasingly erratic trade situation, but it was still going up. By the time the Fed rate hit 2.4% at the beginning of 2019, Trump did his freakout on the Fed and they decided to stop increases. Then, with the economy still increasing but also still showing signs of slowing the Fed decided to cut rates, according to Fed Chair Powell, ""to ensure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade tensions."" 

So there are a lot of signs recently that a recession might be on it's way. If/when it does happen, how much much will our already very low interest rates effect things? It seems to me like it's going to be a pretty big issue and it's going to make what happens, if it happens, worse than it should be. At least that's what I get from the history of these things. Got my fingers crossed that I'm wrong.",14,0.94,1565821431.0

t3_cvl0zs,Design Patterns for Decentralization,"Nature (evolution) has shown us beautiful design patterns for intelligent systems. One such intelligent system is the physical body of any species in the animal kingdom. An animal is centralized in that it has a central nervous system and central blood pump (heart) that supplies blood throughout the system.
On the other hand, we have recently understood that there is no central point of control in the animal brain. We now know that emergent intelligence is pretty much a decentralized thing: there are no central neurons in the same sense as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) in the digital computer. The brain is a fully distributed, decentralized system in which not one neuron (or even group of neurons) controls the system. Its intelligence is an emergent property of the system as a whole, in which each neuron has limited but wide-area input tentacles and both far and wide output coverage.

Decentralize! has become the battlecry for the blockchain revolution. Let’s think about this for a moment …
In other words, nature has shown us beautiful and highly effective designs that have both centralized and decentralized characteristics. I think what nature is showing us is that there are parts of the system in which decentralization make sense and there are parts in which centralization make more sense. The decentralization/centralization question is not a system-wide issue; it is rather like a design pattern issue. You cannot have a system that is wholly decentralized; some parts of it must necessarily be centralized.
In the animal body, there are only two sub-systems that are centralized: command and feedback signals (nerves and the central nervous system) and blood supply. The brain itself is highly decentralized, as we have already noted. Throughout the animal body, outside of the input and output signal connections and cardiac sub-system, everything else is decentralized. We can go down to the cell level and see that each cell is a complex system that functions independently except as regards to energy distribution and waste disposal. When an invading foreign bacteria enters the system, the response is local (even though the effect can be global, as in a viral infection). Some groups of cells receive signals from the central nervous system (muscles). Sensor cells stimulate the input pathways to the brain.
We can think of an independent country or human society as a “system” with lots of sub-systems. We have determined that there are sub-systems that are better centralized (the military, for example) and sub-systems that are better decentralized (like mass media and business). We have tried different system designs for society. In the communist design we have centralized control of both mass media and business; in the capitalist system we have decentralized mass media and business. In either design, government must necessarily be both centralized and rigid.
The whole point here is this: a system cannot be wholly decentralized; otherwise, it’s not a system but total chaos. This is as true in blockchain system design as it is in societal system design. Therefore, the ideal is not a totally decentralized society; the ideal, rather, is a design that affords the most freedom and yet allows us all to advance to a better place.

t3_dtkai8,I have a question for real economists out there. I play a very deep game with a rich and complex economy. We are a very large alliance (20k) with a big self-regulated market. Two of us have had a long standing argument about what is best....,"First some background and information.

We play Eve Online. Eve Online has a complex market economy because all of the goods are made by players and sold by players on open markets, which are stations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online#Economy All NPC stations have a market and some player stations can have a market if that module is installed. Here are some places you can see the market live: https://www.evemarkethelper.net/, https://evemarketer.com/, https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore . On the market you can trade both raw goods and components up to and including finished products. Each of these fluctuate based on whatever players want to charge for the items. Here you can see the cost of a Stealth Bomber and each of these is an order to sell and on the bottom are the orders to buy. https://evemarketer.com/types/12032. You can change the orders every 5 minutes and change the price to go up or down, etc. The interesting thing is that you can buy Plex with real money, and then sell that on the market for in game currency. So that market is pretty active. Basically 1 billion ISK = $10USD. When I talk about prices below, people can buy something on our market for 5c and then up the price to 50c-1USD, and that is common.

**Here is the setup**

We are in an alliance of several thousand people. We live outside of the normal area and maintain our own market. This market is only accessible by people in our alliance. Side note that spys can join our alliance and mess up the market as well. The movement of going from where we live to where the main market hubs are is considerable. So to stock our market we either have to 1. build it locally, 2. buy it at a market hub and have it shipped down, 3. find it out doing PVE activities. Our market has unreasonably higher prices on most items. So if you take the market hub price and add shipping, tax, effort .. that would be some random price. The price in our market is 1000s of % higher than that. This is not healthy because lots of the things that people need to buy on our market need to be bought quickly and that forces them to pay insanely high prices.

**Here is the problem**

Some players buy things on our market and then relist them back on our market for some random price that they want. They will buy all of said item, and then relist said item for 1000% of the original price. This may or may not be caught by someone who can actually fix the issue by having more of the item shipped down from a market hub and then putting them up for a slightly higher than previous price. The relister can then buy all of that item again and at to their personal stock, thus keeping the monopoly on the item and the price.

**Here is my view**

People who relist on our personal market are adding a ""personal tax"" to items and creating waves of effort by others to correct their greed. People who relist are leeches because there is no retribution on leadership's side. They just buy them all, change the price, and then if and when someone challenges their monopoly they can just lower their price again. The people who needed the items between those times must pay the exorbitant price that he set. I think this behavior causes people to NOT want to participate in the market and the price gouging causes several problems. Price gouging causes people to not buy items out of spite. It is a non-team way to play the game and try to help our alliance.

**Here is my buddy's view**

If person A lists an item for profit and then person B buys all of the item and then relists them, everyone wins. Person A has made a profit and Person B has created opportunity to undercut him. So either person A can go buy more of said item and then list them for an undercut price or someone else can see the high prices and that person can ship in more items, thus creating more items on the market.

**Final Thoughts**

Our market has allowed relisting for several years. Our market is not in a good place. Thousands of items are marked up extensively and this causes all sorts of fallout. Their aren't that many people relisting, because mainly its seen as bad teamplay and morally wrong. Neither me or my buddy are economists, but he keeps using all of these random macroeconomics theories and whatnot, I think its horse pucky. What say you?",2,1.0,1573240900.0

#How FedEx Cut Its Tax Bill to $0
*By Jim Tankersley, Peter Eavis and Ben Casselman
Nov. 15, 2019*

WASHINGTON — In the 2017 fiscal year, FedEx owed more than $1.5 billion in taxes. The next year, it owed nothing. What changed was the Trump administration’s tax cut — for which the company had lobbied hard.

The public face of its lobbying effort, which included a tax proposal of its own, was FedEx’s founder and chief executive, Frederick Smith, who repeatedly took to the airwaves to champion the power of tax cuts. “If you make the United States a better place to invest, there is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment,” he said on an August 2017 radio show hosted by Larry Kudlow, who is now chairman of the National Economic Council.

Four months later, President Trump signed into law the $1.5 trillion tax cut that became his signature legislative achievement. FedEx reaped big savings, bringing its effective tax rate from 34 percent in fiscal year 2017 to less than zero in fiscal year 2018, meaning that, overall, the government technically owed it money. But it did not increase investment in new equipment and other assets in the fiscal year that followed, as Mr. Smith said businesses like his would.

Nearly two years after the tax law passed, the windfall to corporations like FedEx is becoming clear. A New York Times analysis of data compiled by Capital IQ shows no statistically meaningful relationship between the size of the tax cut that companies and industries received and the investments they made. If anything, the companies that received the biggest tax cuts increased their capital investment by less, on average, than companies that got smaller cuts.

FedEx’s financial filings show that the law has so far saved it at least $1.6 billion. Its financial filings show it owed no taxes in the 2018 fiscal year overall. Company officials said FedEx paid $2 billion in total federal income taxes over the past 10 years.

As for capital investments, the company spent less in the 2018 fiscal year than it had projected in December 2017, before the tax law passed. It spent even less in 2019. Much of its savings have gone to reward shareholders: FedEx spent more than $2 billion on stock buybacks and dividend increases in the 2019 fiscal year, up from $1.6 billion in 2018, and more than double the amount the company spent on buybacks and dividends in fiscal year 2017.

A spokesman said it was unfair to judge the effect of the tax cuts on investment by looking at year-to-year changes in the company’s capital spending plans.

“FedEx invested billions in capital items eligible for accelerated depreciation and made large contributions to our employee pension plans,” the company said in a statement. “These factors have temporarily lowered our federal income tax, which was the law’s intention to help grow G.D.P., create jobs and increase wages.”

FedEx’s use of its tax savings is representative of corporate America. Companies have already saved upward of $100 billion more on their taxes than analysts predicted when the law was passed. Companies that make up the S&P 500 index had an average effective tax rate of 18.1 percent in 2018, down from 25.9 percent in 2016, according to an analysis of securities filings. More than 200 of those companies saw their effective tax rates fall by 10 points or more. Nearly three dozen, including FedEx, saw their tax rates fall to zero or reported that tax authorities owed them money.

From the first quarter of 2018, when the law fully took effect, companies have spent nearly three times as much on additional dividends and stock buybacks, which boost a company’s stock price and market value, than on increased investment.

#Statement from Frederick W. Smith, Chairman and CEO of FedEx Corporation
*November 17, 2019*

The New York Times published a distorted and factually incorrect story on the front page of the Sunday, November 17 edition concerning FedEx and our billions of dollars of tax payments and billions of dollars of investments in the U.S. economy.  Pertinent to this outrageous distortion of the truth is the fact that unlike FedEx, the New York Times paid **zero** federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of $111 million, and only $30 million in 2018 – 18% of their pretax book income.  Also in 2018 the New York Times cut their capital investments nearly in half to $57 million, which equates to a rounding error when compared to the $6 billion of capital that FedEx invested in the U.S. economy during that same year.

I hereby challenge A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax.  The focus of the debate should be federal tax policy and the relative societal benefits of business investments and the enormous intended benefits to the United States economy, especially lower and middle class wage earners.

I look forward to promptly hearing from Mr. Sulzberger and scheduling this open event to bring further public awareness of the facts related to these important issues.",11,0.77,1574074772.0

Hello, I'm a student and I'm studying about immigration specifically in Melbourne, Australia. The quote above has been extracted from an overall analysis report of Australia's immigration by the Migration Council of Australia. Could anyone help me in understanding why there is a loss of productivity because of immigration?

&#x200B;

In the quote, it's apparently because a larger labour force, which I presume is simply because of increased population due to immigration, is living off of a stock of natural resources, which I presume is stuff like surviving off of Australian-grown beef? I don't really understand the last part. Does it matter if a larger labour force is applied to a fixed stock of natural resources? If the economy and GDP is increased because of immigration, then wouldn't it be irrelevant as Australia can just import the products they have lost? Or is it because a larger labour force would open more opportunities for more industrialisation and more green land is lost to new infrastructure like factories which cause pollution?",6,1.0,1574310605.0

t3_e015rk,Stable Economy: Fighting Hyperinflation with Cryptocurrencies,"Hyperinflation is usually caused by an extremely rapid growth in the currency supply of an economy. When the monetary and fiscal policy allows the issuance of new money to accommodate government spending, the money supply grows faster than the real output of the economy, thus causing inflation. In this context, hyperinflation occurs as a result of uncontrollable inflation.  Although hyperinflation is a rare event for advanced economies, it has occurred many times throughout history in countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Argentina.  


With the rising interest in cryptocurrencies and alarming signs of hyperinflation in the economy, it’s about time for people to revisit history for  [**signs of hyperinflation**](https://kucoinblog.com/cryptocurrencies-solution-for-hyperinflation-sk-rd)  and potential ways to combat it. For Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not based on centralized systems, their worth cannot be determined by regulatory or economic institutions. Blockchain technology assures that the issuance of new coins follows a predefined schedule and that each unit is unique and immune to duplication.   


These are some of the reasons why cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular particularly in countries that are dealing with hyperinflation, such as Venezuela. Similar occurrences can be seen in Zimbabwe, where digital currencies peer-to-peer payments have seen a dramatic increase. Positively, as cryptocurrency matures that volatility will calm down. In the meantime, people with guaranteed losses in their home currency are willing to take a chance that cryptocurrency will be more stable than the local fiat currency.",7,0.72,1574430280.0

t3_eabyjs,We Have A Problem," While reading some of Ray Dalio's posts on Long Term Debt Cycle, something ominous hit me. Donald Trump is following the long-term deleveraging campaign Ray Dalio prescribes. However, Donald trump is executing it for perverse reasons. The deleveraging phase is required when simply lowering interest rates has no more impact. So, the central bank must print money to stimulate the economy. But printing money does nothing except for those who have financial assets and credit they can use for borrowing. The government must act to increase spending in order to get the freshly printed money into productive use. Ray Dalio promotes this may prove successful when the income produced with the freshly printed money more than offsets the debt added.  The problem with Donald Trump's policies is we are not deleveraging. Worse than that, Donald Trump's actions are only marginally increasing income while at the same time continuing to increase debt.   Ray Dalio promotes the deleveraging phase to commence while businesses, banks, and people act to reduce their debt and agree that slow income growth is acceptable. 

 Starting the deleveraging cycle while businesses, banks, and people still demand high income growth and high debt - at a time when asset values, debt levels, and incomes are not aligned, while growth has already been slow for many years - is asking for trouble. Asset values are illusory, being pumped up by ever more debt. This has no effect on equity.  But the problem is worse than a simple bubble. Because the government and central bank have started the deleveraging cycle before the economy is ready, central bank policies may prove useless when the economy does slow.   Why does Donald Trump do this? These actions make people and businesses feel wealthy. Donald trump takes credit. Donald Trump gets reelected. When the economy does fall apart, Donald Trump will blame everyone around him and claim only he can fix the problem. So, he asks for a third term i office.

t3_ebb2rv,How to model money generation in a closed economic system?,"Hello, fellow redditors;

For some time I've been living with this problem that I can't find the solution either by thinking about it nor looking online. By firstly known that I have absolutely no background in economic science knowledge, but a strong academic background in mathematical tools to understand such model. The thing is that a few years ago I tried to create a toy model by myself that didn't pursue the goal of being realistic at all but giving me some cool graphs and statistics to analyze for fun. So I'm going to describe briefly this model to, hopefully, give you guys an idea of what I'm thinking of.

This model in question had several goods forming a chain of production that eventually got bought by ""the people"". I don't remember the specifics of the chain but it could be that there are two goods (call them A and B) that can either be bought directly by the people or combined to form a more valuable good C that can be bought too by the people. The specifics of the rules that I came up to recreate this are of no importance to the problem here, let's just say that the ""factories"" that produced these goods could alter their amount production depending on the demand and the price also varies according to this. So in the end, there is a dynamical system where both supply (the factories directly change this) and the demand (the people can get out of money and stop buying something) vary as too does the price.

The problem is what follows: not everybody cand earn money at the same time. This is a zero-sum situation. If A, B and the people have benefits is in the expense of C, which is losing it. Being in my model the control of production tied to this benefits (they decrease if the factory loses money) it leads to immediate collapse of the system in little time so, in the end, the solution I came up was to introduce ""the government"" which had it own demand and just unlimited cash to pay for it. What I found out is that the system was pretty sensitive to the amount of cash introduced by the government. If too few the system collapsed anyway, but too much and the prices went up exponentially (literally).

I understand that the introduction of money in the system is something that has to be modelled somehow. In the end, money is a representation of the value generated by the economy and in each step of the chain of production, this value is increased. But the question here is how to do it. I think that the government thing is a gross simplification of central banks emitting money but how can be measured the right quantity of money to be created and the best way to introduce it in a simple model like mine?

I'd appreciate any help that is specific to enlight me in this problem, but also any read on the matter that you think could interest me. As I said I have no economic education so most of the times that I look something up I end up finding out that I just don't know the technical terms to look for it and I just find a generic explanation. What I look for is a mathematical model or at least something I can take simple equations from. For example, if I look for something like ""economic models"" I just find thins that talk about the played-out curves of supply and demand which are of absolutely no help to me. I know it must be a name to the model I try to recreate but I just don't know it...",2,1.0,1576475669.0

t3_eehwo2,Recession?,"With the mainstream media screaming that a recession is imminent, let's have a look at how things could potentially pan out over the coming years and where we stand...

A Markets Insider article in August looked at a study by the National Association for Business Economics, showing that 72% of the economists surveyed predicted that a recession would occur by the end of 2021.

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/next-recession-trump-survey-shows-most-economists-predict-downturn-2021-2019-8-1028456445](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/next-recession-trump-survey-shows-most-economists-predict-downturn-2021-2019-8-1028456445)

This followed news in August that the yield curve had inverted - this has correctly predicted every recession since the 60s.

Are they correct?

Let's paint a picture...

First off, we can see that, after the 50% correction in the aftermath of the Great Recession in 08, the S&P 500 hit roughly 750 in the first half of 09.

Since then, we have effectively seen the longest economic expansion in US history with massive rallies across the board and the S&P currently sitting well above 3000.

This is because we've had REAL economic growth and the stock market is representing that real world abundance AND record corporate debt (currently around $10 trillion) has been used by companies to invest in the real world economy.

JUST KIDDING!

What has *actually* happened since 08?

Since 08, in response to the crisis in 08, the Fed has printed money.

A LOT OF MONEY. This is known as quantitative easing. In total, give or take $3.8 trillion has been printed since 08.

A couple of years back, in 2017, the Fed started to unwind its balance sheet (known as quantitative tightening).

However, that changed in dramatic fashion this year, as the Repo crisis reared it's ugly head.

Basically the Fed stepped in on an emergency (supposedly short term) basis due to a lack of liquidity in the market. However, some banks (unnamed for obvious reasons) were still struggling to find the cash they needed to hit their reserve ratios - this is a consequence of fractional reserve banking.

Very recently, this has been ramped up even more, with another $425 billion being injected into the system before year-end.

Of course, this is just an emergency measure for a few months since September, and *does not* constitute quantitative easing, even though the impact on the Fed's balance sheet is in effect the same (lol)...

Now, enough of the Fed and Repos, let's look at corporate debt:

So, as I mentioned before, corporate debt is pretty high - nearly $10 trillion and 47% of the overall economy.

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12-1028731031](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12-1028731031)

Some say that companies are using this record level of corporate debt to continue to finance the cash on their balance sheets necessary for stock buybacks, and not using this debt to invest in the REAL WORLD economy.

Hence, the vast amounts of cash corporations have had on their balance sheets has been holding up equity markets, with the **main demand for equities over the last decade coming from corporate stock buybacks**.

So, in essence, companies are using the extra cash on their balance sheets to buy their shares and keep them propped up, while recently there has been near record insider selling.

Corporations are not using this extra debt to invest in the REAL world economy, they are instead using it to supplement stock buybacks.

The best thing is that while they continue with stock buybacks to keep the share price propped up, they are selling their personal shares in the business and lining the pockets with profits.

Thus, they personally position themselves defensively and hedge - such that when the recession hits in the next 1-2 years, retail and 401k investors take the main hit.

The insiders are already out - and of course the tax payers through FED hyperinflation will bail the dead company or economy out...

Thus, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.

Some say this will lead to a major credit freeze soon, more quantitative easing and the banks will need MASSIVE capital injections along with potentially negative rates.

The bottom line is that one should be prepared.

Bearin' in mind (get it...) what I said before about the main demand for equities over the last decade coming from corporate stock buybacks, it is telling that in the **second quarter of 2019 we saw a** **significant decline**.

Some say ""just ride the wave, the Fed is printing more, equities go up"".

To me, the risk/reward is not worthwhile here. Like I said, since 08, we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history and we've had a return of \~360%. The only other period that had the same return (it was slightly higher actually) was the roaring 20s. We all know what happened after that! No, I am not being a doomer and saying we will have another Great Depression 😂

However, what is interesting is that Central Banks played a large role in the 20s which lead to problems later down the line...

So, we have painted a clear picture - the writing is on the wall...

t3_encdvc,Let’s be real about this $100k Taco Bell job.,"Everyone seems to be stunned - and dare I say excited - by Taco Bell saying they will pay a select number of store managers $100,000 per year. 

Let’s be realistic about what this is.

1) Good money but not great money. (Maybe not even “good” money in a high-cost urban area.) Especially when you consider that person probably has to manage a staff of 20-25 people at a restaurant that’s open something like 110 hours per week. It may not be rocket science but it’s undoubtedly hard damn work. How much would you need to get paid to do that job?

2) The average Taco Bell restaurant pulls in more than $1.5M in annual revenue. The average Taco Bell won’t have a $100k manager. Only the very busiest restaurants will. Those restaurants probably do in the neighborhood of $2.5M. Shouldn’t any fast paced business doing $2.5M annually have a leader making six figures?

Let’s all just agree that making six figures isn’t a magical fairytale land reserved for the few and the degreed. It’s for anyone who works their butt off and produces revenue that justifies a $100,000 salary. Even if it’s done one loco taco at a time.",9,0.76,1578772915.0

According to official data released on Friday, the Chinese economy grew by 6.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with a year earlier and by 6.1% for the whole year.

Although China's growth in 2019 was the slowest rate of economic growth in 29 years, held back by anemic domestic demand and trade conflict with the United States, it met analyst expectations and was within the official goal of the government.

All the data from industrial production, fixed assets to retail, shows signs that the end of the business cycle is coming to an end, said Daniel Gerard, senior asset strategist with multiple assets at State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong.

Recent data indicate improved Chinese manufacturing and business confidence as trade tensions ease, but analysts are not sure whether they will succeed, and Beijing is expected to launch additional incentive measures.

The MSCI index for Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan increased by 0.1%.

The CSI300 China blue-chip Index rose 0.27%, boosting growth driven by hopes for better relations with the United States, which have risen 9% since early December.

Australian shares added 0.47% after four consecutive record highs in previous days, while KOSPI in Seoul rose 0.12%. Japanese Nikkei rose 0.49% after reaching 15-month highs earlier in the session.

The MSCI global stock index touched new highs and last increased by 0.03%.

Analysts say global stocks may find it difficult to maintain momentum from their recent rally, as optimism about the US-China trade cease-fire is inferior to uncertainties about the next steps in trade negotiations.

Despite the Phase 1 agreement signed by China and the United States on Wednesday, experts believe it is unlikely that a large balsam can be achieved for wider friction between the two countries. Most of the tariffs introduced during the dispute remain valid, and a number of urgent issues that caused the conflict has not yet been resolved.

t3_eta00f,Currency supply contraction after you default on a loan,"Mike Maloney writes in his book *Guide to investing in gold and silver (page 26):*

>When we take out a loan from a bank, the bank does not actually loan us any of the currency that was on deposit at the bank. Instead, the second the pen hits the paper on the mortgage, loan document, or credit card receipt that we are signing, the bank is allowed to create those dollars as a book entry. In other words, we create the currency. The bank is not allowed to do it without our signature. We create the currency, and then the bank gets to charge us interest for the currency we created. This brand-new currency we just created then becomes part of the currency supply. Much of our currency supply is created in this way.

and continues:

>But when a home goes into foreclosure, a loan gets defaulted on, or someone files bankruptcy, that currency simply disappears back into currency heaven where it came from. So as credit goes bad, the currency supply contracts, and deflation sets in.

I disargee. When a consumer defaults his loan, the bank will not get back the money it created, but those money probably still circulates (consumer bought something for this money..).

t3_eulg1f,Japan's annual inflation tops all forecasts,"The December figure was 0,8%, although analysts had expected prices to rise by only 0,4%.

Consumer prices in Japan in annual terms increased by 0,8%, while in November the figure was 0,5%.

The indicator was twice as high as the forecast of surveyed analysts at 0,4%. One of the main drivers of price increases was the increase in sales tax in October last year. However, the figure is still far from the target of the Bank of Japan at 2%.

At the same time, the basic consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil prices but excludes volatile prices for fresh food, rose in December compared with the previous year by 0,7%, which is in line with forecasts. In November, growth was 0,5%.

In December, Japanese authorities introduced a $ 120 billion fiscal stimulus package to support the growth of the world's third-largest economy.

In January of this year the Bank of Japan, following a two-day meeting, kept the monetary policy unchanged and improved forecasts for economic growth. At the same time, the regulator lowered the forecast for inflation very optimistically.

""Factors such as labor shortages and higher sales taxes have helped companies raise prices ... but we expect consumer inflation to fluctuate depending on wage recovery,"" Hiroaki Mutu, chief economist at Tokyo Research Institute, commented on the situation. ""The Bank of Japan has lowered its forecasts for consumer price inflation, but they are still optimistic. We expect the central bank to maintain the current pace of stimulus policies.""

t3_ew5lln,The Cantillon Effect and Wealth Inequality,"Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified, so even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about**.

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.

For instance, the financial sector contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited. In other words, the phenomenon of **asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

t3_ewmn4o,Industrial production in Japan in the IV quarter fell at a record pace,"Industrial production in Japan in October-December showed a record decline amid weak external and domestic demand.

https://preview.redd.it/yxfslajve3e41.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b41e2139c041b74ef7d4b1d1b0481148c925d5f

Industrial production in the fourth quarter of 2019 scaled down by 4%, according to the final data of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of the country. This is the most drastic decrease since the beginning of observations in 2013.

In December, industrial production increased by 1,3%, exceeding the forecast, surveyed economists' growth of 0,7%. In November, industrial production fell by 1% after getting down by 4,5% a month earlier.

Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan expect that industrial production will soar by 3,5% in January and 4,1% in February.

Retail sales in Japan in December fell by 2,6% year on year. The decline was recorded for the third month in a row. Economists on average predicted a 1,8% decline in sales.

This dynamic of retail sales reinforces concerns about consumer spending after the October increase in sales taxes.

Retail sales are a crucial indicator of the dynamics of private consumption, which accounts for about 60% of the Japanese economy.

Disappointing data on industrial production and retail sales increase the probability that the Japanese economy contracted in the fourth quarter.

The spread of a new type of coronavirus poses an additional risk to the economy. Japanese Economic Recovery Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned this week that corporate profits and industrial production could be affected by the outbreak of coronavirus in China.

Separate data showed on Friday that unemployment in Japan, seasonally adjusted in December, remained at 2,2%, around a 30-year low.

The ratio of the number of vacancies and job seekers last month remained at the level of 1,57. This means that there were 157 open vacancies per 100 job seekers.

Japan's labor force is rapidly declining due to an aging population, which leads to low unemployment.

The basic consumer price index in Tokyo, which does not take into account the price of fresh food, in January was 0,7%. Analysts forecast an average price increase of 0,8% in annual terms.

Inflation in Japan keeps well below the target 2%, despite low unemployment and years of massive monetary stimulus.

According to IOBE analysts, the Greek economy is finally showing signs of recovery after nearly a decade of economic woes. The Greek think tanks expects Greek consumer activity to grow by 1.4 percent and exports by 5.5-6 percent.

The IOBE forecast remains in line with its previous estimate but below the government’s 2.8 percent projection for 2020.

How do I determine what state is the best when I already know the other data collectively points to Mass?           
I am sorely lost and could use a point in the right direction.",2,1.0,1582333220.0
t3_f8yl2u,Question about universal health care and the effect on medical/dental doctor salaries,"Hello, first post and on mobile so apologies. Been thinking a lot about the upcoming election and some of the plans candidates are throwing around. My question is what would happen if universal health care was implemented in the US to the salaries of dentists and doctors. I am currently enrolled in a doctoral program and will be in around 300k debt by the end of it all. Honestly I’m nervous right now that if the universal health care is implemented and I’m put in a higher tax bracket because of my profession I will never be able to get out of debt. Can anyone offer advice or clarification on the matter?",5,0.86,1582579904.0
t3_f9ci6k,Hello. I wrote a text about China's economy. Please let me know if there are any mistakes and if the text is engaging.,"Although the United States' economy is bigger by about 7 trillion dollars than China's GDP, it has replaced the United States as the engine of the global economy, providing by far the largest contribution to growth in recent years and pulling along the world’s smaller economies in its train. They have well over 18 thousand miles of high-speed rail, which is more than the entire world has combined. Despite this, in 2008, it only had a few miles.

The Chinese can build a hospital in 10 days and, in 2004, China had just 21,300 miles of expressway; the number quadrupled of the current expressway system had about 80,000 miles. But, it wasn't always like this.

  In 1949, after the end of World War 2, under the rule of Mao Zedong, the People's republic of China was created. He adopted the Soviet Model and for 30 years, China had a devastating period. He launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1957, which persecuted at least 550,000 people, most of whom were intellectuals and dissidents. From 1958 to 1962 he starved between 20 and 60 million people. China was mostly a rural country in which the economy was based on agriculture. It was so poor, that more than 88% of the people were living with just under $2 a day. Its economy was only about 5% of the United States at the time and was almost equal to Zambia's GDP.

  Between 1948 and 1979, The Chinese economy grew at a very small rate, about 4 to 6%, remaining one of the poorest countries in the world, having a GDP of 60 billion dollars. In comparison, as of March 2019, 8 people had a net worth bigger than the entire wealth of China. This slow growth was due to maintained policies that kept the economy very poor, stagnant, centrally controlled, vastly inefficient, and relatively isolated from the global economy. A large share of the country’s economic output was directed and controlled by the state, which set production goals, controlled prices, and allocated resources throughout most of the economy. During the 1950s, if you had a household farm it would have been collectivized into large communes. You would still be able to grow your own crops, but the prices were set by the Chinese state. By 1978, about 800 million people lived in poverty and people were not happy about it. But, one day, on the 9th of September 1976, Chairman Mao Zedong died and an era ended.

  In 1978, the Chinese government decided to break with its Soviet-style economic policies by gradually reforming the economy according to free-market principles and opening up trade and investment with the West, in the hope that this would significantly increase economic growth and raise living standards.

   The first economic reforms were launched it 1979. The central government initiated price and ownership incentives for farmers, which enabled them to sell a portion of their crops on the free market. This meant that the farmers could finally set their own prices.

Also, the government established four special economic zones along the coast to attract foreign investment, boost exports, and importing high technology products into China. And companies came because people asked for low wages compared to the United States or other western countries. Economic control of various enterprises was given to provincial and local governments, which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free-market principles, rather than under the direction and guidance of state planning. Besides, citizens were encouraged to start their own businesses. Additional coastal regions and cities were designated as open cities and development zones, which allowed them to experiment with free-market reforms and to offer tax and trade incentives to attract foreign investment. In 1984, China further opened 14 coastal cities to overseas investment, including Shanghai, which shanghai stock exchange is located after it was reopened in December 1990.

   Since the introduction of economic reforms, China’s economy has grown substantially faster than during the pre-reform period, and, for the most part, has avoided major economic disruptions.10 From 1979 to 2018, China’s annual real GDP averaged 9.5%. This has meant that on average China has been able to double the size of its economy in real terms every eight years and, China’s added GDP in 2018 exceeded the value of Australia’s total output, although China’s economic growth rate slowed to the lowest level in 28 years.

   So, how did China's economy skyrocketed? Economists generally attribute much of China’s rapid economic growth to two main factors: large-scale capital investment, financed by large domestic savings and foreign investment and rapid productivity growth. These two factors appear to have gone together hand in hand. China is the biggest exporter in the world, as many of the objects right now in your home are made in china like Your iPhone, your computer and some of your clothes.

Even if China has the second-biggest economy in the world, the average wage per person per year is about $19.000, having similar GDP per capita to the Dominican republic or Gabon. It is still an increase because China's poverty rate fell from 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015.

 As China’s economy has matured, its real GDP growth has slowed significantly, from 14.2% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2018, and that growth is projected by the International Monetary Fund to fall to 5.5% by 2024. The Chinese government has indicated its desire to move away from its current economic model of fast growth at any cost to more “smart” economic growth, which seeks to reduce reliance on energy-intensive and high-polluting industries and rely more on high technology, green energy, and services. This fast-growing economy of China had massive consequences on the environment. The air in the big cities of China is one of the most polluted in the whole world, covered by smog, which brings many problems to citizens' health. hand.",2,1.0,1582646917.0

To illustrate this point, I’m going to walk through bare-bones of how farsighted policymakers in China and global demand (especially US demand) for cheap production from 1990–2014 combined to form *the largest movement of human beings out of poverty in history*. Then, I want to briefly discuss how to merge the macro and micro picture of sourcing ethics to form a framework that I think leaves two routes for companies to approach “practical ethical sourcing”.

&#x200B;

# Macro Ethics: What China Did

Here’s a very simplistic account of what happened with China since 1990. The competitive advantage of cheap labor and production allowed Chinese businesses to grow massively, selling to other countries who outsourced their production to Chinese factories. This created a positive trade balance (how much more a country exports than it imports), which meant a large positive “current account” for China (trade balance plus a few other metrics of income from other countries).

Generally speaking, this kind of competitive advantage erodes in two ways:

1. **Your currency gets more expensive, which raises production costs in foreign currency terms.** This happens because exporters are selling goods in large quantities to foreign countries (let’s use US entities as the base case here). Those exporters get dollars for their goods, and then have to buy yuan with those dollars to pay production costs in China. *Basically this means a whole lot of dollars being sold to buy yuan, pushing the price of the yuan up.*
2. **Wages rise.** This happens because export businesses see such good demand that they keep cropping up and keep hiring until all the cheap labor is basically hired, and then they start pricing the labor more competitively with each other and driving up labor costs (wages). *Basically more demand for workers in China means higher wages in China.*

Chinese policy makers knew this was going to happen, and thought “we don’t want a strong currency, we want a middle class,” so they began offsetting the upward pressure on the yuan by accumulating reserves — mostly dollar reserves. This meant that rather than being eroded through currency appreciation, the competitive advantage would be eroded through increasing wages (see “Appreciation Note” at end).

So how does this work? The Chinese government needs to sell a lot of yuan for dollars — enough to counter the buying pressure from all the export income being used to buy yuan.

The way this mechanically works is the Chinese government goes out and buys enough US government bonds to offset the the massive inflow. They sell yuan for dollars to buy US bonds, and the yuan stays flat against the dollar instead of rising. The Chinese government can make as much yuan as they want, so there’s no reason to bet that they’d run out of yuan to sell.

You’ll notice a few things in the chart below: the overall scale of both grows massively over the time period, and they grow roughly in line with each-other as reserve purchases offset the current account income. The reserve accumulation here is outpacing current account inflows in part because there are additional pressures to offset at times (foreign investment), and in part because I’m proxying it with an imperfect solution that will capture some appreciation of the reserves (see “Analytics Note” at end for explanations of this and some other important analytical choices like why this isn’t in GDP terms, etc.). You’ll also notice the picture gets a little messy in the post-crisis period, which makes sense as global demand constricted and capital flows got kind of wack.

&#x200B;

[\(Data sources at the end\)](https://preview.redd.it/35s1wv4le9j41.jpg?width=484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac80c67d5b7190969329f184d788780ac2723944)

In the early nineties, the Chinese government had unified the swap and official exchange rate, creating a 33% devaluation overnight, and then began to directly intervene in the currency’s value. Because the government was buying dollars (selling yuan) at the same rate that the exporters (and others) were buying yuan (selling dollars) the yuan avoided rapid appreciation. Instead, they allowed it to just make slow and steady gains over time.

The impact of this was that China retained a competitive advantage in the export market for longer than it otherwise would, and the advantage would only erode through rising wages. As continued demand for cheap production meant expansion of production facilities, new jobs, and demand for workers, wage competition took over and started to improve the income of Chinese workers.

This wage increase means more money every month for a previously impoverished segment of the world population — a massive impact in terms of human well-being.

&#x200B;

Nothing like that, on that sort of scale, has ever happened. But, things like that do happen on smaller scales in smaller countries all the time when competitive export pricing allows them to increase their wealth through global export markets and policymakers make good choices.

If you care about wealth inequality in a global sense, and about redistribution of wealth to poorer nations, then a lot of good is done by globalization of supply chains and demand for cheap labor (to the degree that this can ultimately translate to higher wages over time). Market dynamics distributing demand to geographies with cheap production can lift entire populations out of poverty. Today, the countries this most aptly applies to are the cohort of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc.

*Does this justify human rights violations?*

No. It does not.

*Were early industrial revolution coal mining towns that verged on slave labor “fair game” because they increased the wealth of the population over a few generations?*

No.

That macro picture is all well and good, but as individuals who are decision-makers on these things, we have our own moral obligation to maintain a threshold of ethical treatment regardless of the optimization of profits. Pay attention to what your factories do, of course, and don’t work with people who dehumanize their workers.

The take-away of the macro picture is just this:

*Cheap isn’t evil. Evil is evil.*

So, how do we resolve this macro picture with obvious micro-ethical factors as we decide how to support better working conditions and avoid flagrant exploitation?

# Practical Ethical Sourcing and Where You Have Impact

Despite the example above, you are not doing the world any particular positive good by choosing cheap factories. Unless you are in charge of manufacturing for a massive company that is a driver of the global market, your choices don’t move the needle on this dynamic. Whether or not you outsource your factory to a poorer country with cheaper labor, those large orders that do have an impact are driven by publicly traded companies whose decision makers, while [not actually legally bound](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/corporations-dont-have-to-maximize-profits) to maximize profitability, generally only have their job if they continue to do so. Demand will funnel to cheap production.

*Does that mean that your choices have no impact at all?*

No not necessarily.

To synthesize: there are functionally two ways to run a good, impactful business with “Practical Ethical Sourcing”:

**Version 1:** Go with a competitive production option, and make sure between comparably costed options you pick one that doesn’t have specific practices you find unacceptable (i.e. meets your threshold criteria for ethical practices). For example — refuse to work with factories that employ child labor (and make your own list of other practices you won’t tolerate). This is where *most* businesses who are primarily focused on product and producing value for customers, but also want to maintain ethical standards they are comfortable with, should operate. There is already pressure against most of the worst manufacturing processes, and by consciously avoiding giving evil factories your business you can participate in the process of “starving them out” of the global export market. You are having an impact through who you *don’t* give money to.

**Version 2:** Give your production orders to someone so ethically focused and otherwise non-competitive that orders coming from you are a needle-mover on their probability of survival. To really work it has to be the primary focus of your business and brand, such that you can target your branding materials toward the audience who is willing to spend the premium to cover the additional cost of your “super-ethical” production (or else it isn’t sustainable as a business). The basis of the impact here relies on the fact that the factory is uncompetitive outside of a willingness to pay an ethical premium, so you probably need to be non-competitively priced for retail to maintain margins — which means finding the consumers willing to pay that premium. As an example: T-shirts made form recycled tired tires might not be the best Ts, or the cheapest, but you can make it your business to find the people willing to buy them and generate income for the people who make them. You are having an impact by who you *do* give money to.

It’s usually a problem if a business is falling somewhere in the spectrum between Version 1 and Version 2. They run the risk of either being

1. **More about storytelling than impact** — maybe they advertise the fact that they produce in a high-wage geography (as though that is necessarily morally superior) or generally inflate the benefits of insignificant production choices (a lot of B Corps are like this; I’m considering writing an article about B Corps and how little that means), or
2. **A bad business that won’t sustain itself, and therefore wont have lasting impact** — maybe they are trying to sell products with expensive, alternative, hyper-ethical production processes at competitive retail prices to the general market (possibly, in that case, funding a good brand and broken unit economics with VC money that will inevitably run out).

At [r/MeritStore](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeritStore/), we’re thinking through these problems in real time as we make sourcing decisions. For us, we think the best way is to set an ethical standard of practices we are unwilling to participate in, and then within those reasonable constraints source cost effective production. Looking at factories, we aren’t throwing out certain options simply because the wages there are low compared to the US.

We plan to make sure that we’re ethically comfortable with the factories we use to produce — for our own sake. We want to make a good business that brings great value to our consumers, and doesn’t compromise our ethics. I hope anyone interested in assessing the ethical promise of brands found value in this perspective, and I especially hope it is useful to anyone out there who is trying to navigate their own production sourcing decisions.

I know that this perspective doesn’t harmonize with some of the ethical “ra-ra”ing around certain brands. I’m trying to think this through with data, basic principles, and an eye towards the practical realities of running a business. I would love to hear your thoughts.

*Appreciation Note: You can make the contention that an rising yuan is equivalent to increasing wages, but in effect that is only true to the degree that the wage-earner is buying imports. Wage inflation through a tight labor market more effectively redistributes income share from business owners to workers, while currency appreciation simply has a deflationary impact through diminished import costs (and probably a more positive impact on large holders of Yuan denominated assets who are already wealthy enough to spend abroad).*

*Analytics Note: (1) I’m using YoY change in FX reserves incl. Gold as my “Reserve Accumulation”. This is not a perfect approximation of the flow I would ideally use (reserve purchases) because of reserve asset (especially non-dollar reserve asset) price movements. I think it’s a reasonable enough proxy for the purposes of this post. (2) I also don’t mean to totally ignore other flows and pressures, but won’t do the full balance of payments analysis needed to paint the whole picture — in this case most notably the rest of the capital account. It would only be to demonstrate why these are the important flows I’m talking about. I fear losing the reader’s interest going through why a bunch of other things aren’t the important thing. (3) In this case not doing in GDP terms because I also want to get across the point that the whole scale of the current account and the reserve accumulation is growing. (4) If anyone here has done BoP analysis they’re probably foaming about the fact that the outflows aren’t negative. I thought that might confuse some people, so I didn’t do it. (5) I’m focusing on 1990–2015 because in 2015 some of this dynamic shifted, as there was enough pressure of wealthy folks moving money out of china that the government actually started to sell some reserves (and devalued the yuan 1.5%). The fact that enough people in China had enough money to cause problems with outflows (as well as bust up some real estate markets like Vancouver and Sydney) actually shows that the policy worked.*",2,1.0,1582719042.0

t3_faesdq,Mike Bloomberg,"With a net worth of $64BN as of February 2020, Michael Bloomberg has made headlines recently after his Presidential Campaign has kicked into gear.

Let's take a look at his story and how he became so wealthy...

Bloomberg grew up in Medford, Massachusetts, a suburban city not far from Boston. From a young age, Bloomberg demonstrated the drive and persistence that would later manifest itself.

According to his mother, ""He wanted to be the boss of whatever we were working on. He wanted to run everything.""

In high school, he knew he wanted out of his home town, citing New York as the place to be and emphasising the importance of becoming successful because ""once you had a lot of money you could do things to improve the world.""

Bloomberg attended Johns Hopkins University, where he joined the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. He graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.

In 1966, he graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA.

After he secured his MBA from Harvard, Bloomberg got a job in 1966 (the year England won the World Cup no less...) at Salomon Brothers. He worked in the so-called ""cage"" as a clerk processing trades at $9500 a year - the equivalent today of around $75K.

Bloomberg went on to become head of equity trading and sales for five years.

During his time at Salomon, Richard Levy, who was working for Bloomberg at the time, tells an interesting story regarding Bloomberg's ruthless work ethic...

Levy's grandfather had just died and the funeral was the next day - the same day that a large client was planning a heavy amount of trading.

Bloomberg said: ""‘Would you mind having them change the funeral?'”

Levy refused. Under Jewish law, burial must take place within 24 hours of death.

Bloomberg apologised two hours later.

Some years later, when Levy’s son was born, the infant was admitted to intensive care and was facing a blood transfusion.

Levy called up work and said ""I'm staying until he’s out of intensive care”

However, when he arrived home later, Bloomberg was calling: ""Where have you been?"" He asked Levy.

""I was in intensive care"" Levy replied - to which Bloomberg responded:

""No other father took time off when their kid was born.”

Bloomberg apologised to Levy years later after he had kids of his own, but Levy sums it up here:

**""He's the most brilliant guy I ever worked for, but he's the biggest bastard I ever worked for.""**

Despite potential character flaws, Bloomberg demonstrated this brilliant with the moves he made in his career...

Bloomberg was a general partner at Salomon Brothers.

He lost out in a power struggle, and was effectively demoted. As he knew a fair amount about computers, Bloomberg was put in charge of Salomon's systems.

Bloomberg stayed just long enough to collect a $10MM cash buyout of his partnership stake in the firm as Salomon went public in 1981 in a merger with Philbro. That's the equivalent of around $28MM today. Now that's certainly enough to retire, but Bloomberg had no plans for that. He wanted more.

Using this money, Bloomberg set up a data services company named Innovative Market Systems (IMS) based on his belief that Wall Street would pay a premium for high-quality business information, delivered instantaneously on computer terminals in a variety of usable formats.

The company sold customised computer terminals that delivered real-time market data, financial calculations and other analytics to Wall Street firms. These machines later became known as Bloomberg Terminals.

In 1983, Merrill Lynch became the company's first customer, investing $30 million in IMS to help finance the development of ""the Bloomberg"" terminal computer system. As of 1983, IMS was selling machines exclusively to Merrill Lynch's clients; in 1984, Merrill Lynch released IMS from this exclusive deal.

The company was then renamed Bloomberg L.P. and by 1990, it had installed 8,000 terminals.

As of October 2015, the company had more than 325,000 terminal subscribers worldwide. These subscriptions cost $24,000 per year, discounted to $20,000 for two or more.

As of 2019, Bloomberg employs 20,000 people in dozens of locations.

The company has a revenue of around $10BN.

Therefore, Bloomberg, with his 88% stake, has climbed up the net worth ranking as the number of terminal subscribers has increased over the years.

Bloomberg stated: **""There might be better traders than me, and there might be people who know more about computers. But there's nobody who knows more about both.""**

There are other things of note:

1. He was the mayor of New York City for 12 years, Bloomberg is one of just four individuals to have served that long.
2. Since signing the Giving Pledge in 2010, Bloomberg has given away $8.2BN
3. He has announced that he would sell his company if he were elected President.

Although perhaps this is unlikely...

Do you think he has a shot of becoming President?

t3_fbm4t2,The US economy is a house of cards,"We have been hearing about how fantastic the US economy is.  That may be in question after last week, but a decline is probably overdue.  I think we have all been fed hype by a rigged system

Unemployment is at all-time lows, but the quality of the jobs keeps declining.  1/3 of American workers make less than $20,000 a year, and about 1/2 make less than $30,000.  People work longer hours for worse (or no) benefits with no job security.

The American dream is fading.  We are seeing a generation to generation standard of living decline.  The middle class is being replaced with haves, and mostly, have-nots. Corporations have been contributing to this decline with a 100% focus on shareholders.  Outsourcing, lay-offs, temp workers, reduced benefits, and automation have led to where we are today.

At least we have the stock market to boost our wealth!  For those who have enough income to actually save and invest, the stock market has been on a wild bull run since the great recession of 2008. Stocks nearly tripled under Obama, and continued to rise under Trump until last week.  The stock run-up has driven a tremendous growth in wealth for the top echelons in the US.

The United States is absolutely the wealthiest country in the world.  There are 18.6 million millionaires in the US - about 40% of all the dollar millionaires globally.  Americans are even more dominant in the percentage of Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWI's) who have over $50 million, and of course we rule when it comes to billionaires.

With all this wealth, the median net worth in the US is $65,000.  Sound OK?  Less than 15% of Americans have a pension, so $65K is really not going to take you very far in retirement.  Wealth in America is extremely top heavy.  Most people do not have adequate savings and are not prepared for retirement.

Predicting the stock market is not possible in the short term, but there are some observations that can be made:

* If you look back in time, you can observe painful stock market corrections and bear markets every few years.  The last big ones were in 2008 and 2000.
* The Government has been injecting huge amounts of liquidity into the system.
* Corporations have taken on record levels of debt, lured by artificially low interest rates.
* Companies have been using profits to buy-back their own stock - boosting stock options and c-suite Exec compensation instead of investing for growth.
* By most measures, the stock market valuation is much higher than historical averages (still).

That does not necessarily mean the stock market is going to continue to crash in the short term.  However, history tells us that a bear market will come.  Prepare.

Stock market corrections and recessions are pretty much inevitable.  With the right preparation, the Government can typically respond in ways that bring things back to normal over time, including lowering  interest rates or stimulus spending.  Unfortunately, we have squandered the good economics of the past 11 years and will not have those tools available.  Interest rates have been kept artificially low, and there is now little margin left to lower them further if a recession hits.  In addition, the deficit has ballooned under the most recent administration to $1 trillion, so stimulus spending will be difficult.

The Government is currently spending 1 trillion dollars a year more than they take in through taxes and other revenues, and the only thing we have to show for it is a richer top 1%, a whole lot of low paying jobs with little or no benefits, and crippling debt for our children to deal with.

[It's at its lowest level in history](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/10-year-treasury-yield-plunges.html).

The VIX (the volatility index) spiked to the [highest levels we've seen since 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/volatility-index-vix-spikes-to-highest-level-since-the-financial-crisis-51583775990) on Monday.

It ain't looking good...

Let's start off with the Coronavirus, and the narrative that this is the Black Swan.

Ultimately, this virus is the jet fuel to the warning signs that have been there for many months.

(Of course we had the [yield curve inversion providing the explicit warning](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8-1028482016).)

Yes there will be issues with supply chains and real world consequences due to quarantines and deaths (it seems fairly likely that with the viral coefficient of this thing that there will be a significant number of deaths), but in my opinion the Coronavirus offers a convenient excuse to the masses and distracts from more underlying and deep rooted issues.

Since 2008, we've had Central Banks printing trillions.

Via the Cantillon Effect, [money creation itself increases inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) by fuelling asset price inflation.

We've also had a splurge of stock buybacks - corporations buying back their own stock - with stock buybacks being the [main source of demand on the buy-side for equities](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buybacks-are-the-dominant-source-of-stock-market-demand-and-they-are-fading-fast-goldman-sachs-2019-11-06).

Worryingly, they [decreased in Q2 2019](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/3OSHLeeCPiSKizII70QwYA2).

We've had record levels of corporate debt, which (instead of being used to invest in the real economy) has been used to finance these **STOCK BUYBACKS**.

(In this period we have seen record wealth inequality, and the middle class have been hammered.)

We also have the Repo mess - with the NY Fed recently increasing daily Repo operations from $100BN to $150BN.

We also have hedge funds dangerously over-leveraged.

As well as this, we have had a recent phenomenon of a lot of CEOs resigning in the last year.

Bob Iger [suddenly stepping down](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/02/bob-iger-steps-down-disney) is a prime example.

If you were in your 60s and were making millions of dollars every year as CEO, with a bonus dependent on stock performance, would you:

A) Retire before SHTF and put your feet up as a multi millionaire

or B) Keep your position, SHTF, people lose their jobs and you become a source of hate since you're still making millions (although the bonus is way less because of stock performance).

Remember, you're in your 60s - do you really want to deal with this?

It's important to focus on what people do and not what they say:

Warren Buffett is sitting on cash. A LOT of cash.

Big corporations are sitting on cash ready to buy the blood...

So I'm going to do my best to explain it here in case anyone comes looking.","Banks need to have cash on hand for when people make withdrawals.  When a bank needs cash because its reserves are low, it borrows from other banks, or from the Fed.

When a bank borrows money, like anyone else, it must pay an interest rate.  The Fed decides what the base rate will be.  A borrower bank could potentially go to another bank, which will likely charge a slightly higher interest rate, or it could just borrow from the Fed and pay a lower rate.  In reality, the two rates tend to be so close as to make the difference negligible.

This interest rate charged by the Fed (the Fed Funds Rate) becomes the base rate, and all other interest rates tend to be tied to it, though they are generally higher.  When the Fed Funds Rate goes down, all interest rates go down because in lending to other banks, a bank must be competitive, and being able to borrow money at a lower rate enables the banks to lend it out at a lower rate. When the Fed Funds Rate goes up, all interest rates go up because the banks don't have to compete with the lower rate, and it is more expensive for them to borrow money, so they must lend at a higher rate to be profitable.

When interest rates go down, cash is 'cheaper,' and more readily available; this is the how the Fed 'injects' money into the economy.  It is cheaper to borrow money, so more people borrow.  More people get home mortgages and finance new cars, etc.  The money is spent, and this is how the economy is stimulated.

The Fed puts money into the economy by lending it to banks at a lower rate, and the money quickly filters out to the rest of the economy.",6,0.88,1584106735.0

t3_fjamcc,Does fed cutting rates really make a difference to the interest rate on Loans?,"I recently refinanced my home and I was talking to the Mortgage officer on how much lower the interest rate could be after the fed cut the rate by 50 basis points. To my surprise, the answer was that the rates actually went up for people that want to finance or refinance a home loan.  Here is what she said to me.

&#x200B;

This is a 30 day snapshot of rates. It is inverted that means the higher the FNMA 30-YR = lower rates. Red is bad meaning it opened up higher (lower rate) and closed lower (higher rate) in that specific day which means rates went up. The bottom line is this is typically what we follow and affects our rates daily. On top of this what is not factored here is capacity levels and volatility in the market. With capacities being maxed, lenders price up rates to slow the volume of applications as they can only handle certain amount of loans at a time no matter what the cost is for the rate. Volatility means that lenders get paid if the loan stays on their books for awhile and if sold off, then the lender loses money on the back end. Volatility in the market or extreme change the lenders add a margin on top of the cost of the money since they are getting killed in servicing and don’t know when it will stabilize. Its very very confusing but I can only tell you that leading up to the best cost on money, banks were kind of factoring in on their rates and with the fed cut last Tuesday, the market went haywire with volumes, capacities and volatility so rates began to price up higher each day starting last Tuesday and then the actual market and cost of money sky rocketed yesterday and today again. I believe things will settle down into a pattern again and banks like patterns because they can begin predicting again which will lower that margin back down. You can see last week we hit 103.5 for a few minutes or hours of that day but the market closed at 102.19 today so that equates to a differential of 1.31 so I have never seen such huge spreads and remember the lower the 30 year bond, the higher the rate is going up. For every .25 it equals about .125% higher rate so you can see that rates just under that portion would be almost .625% higher than 1 week plus ago just on cost. That does not factor in the margins and capacity issues that I referred to. It will take awhile for the market to settle down and rates to begin falling back down again but we are much higher than we were a few weeks or a month ago for sure.

&#x200B;

So the customer-facing banks essentially just keep the interest rates unchanged even charge higher for a while on the long term loans, even after the fed cuts the rate.

Say a person makes 80k per year salary plus gets 20k of medical benefits paid by their employer plus the employee covers $5k in premiums. 

With Medicare for all. The employee still gets 80k salary, but the employer doesn’t have to pay the 20k.  The employee would then have much higher taxes to cover the medical expenses. Assuming the 25k would go down to 20k for the medical coverage (more efficient without private insurance middlemen - although this is probably way off as all the currently uninsured people would get averaged in to raise the costs much higher). The employee would pay 20k more in tax and save the 5k they had to pay for premiums. So, employee out 15k more and employer saves 20k. 

Naturally, the employer could be taxed the 20k for the medical coverage for the employee.  The same as before.  However, it would seem like that would be too stark and companies would dump employees like crazy. 

I know these are round numbers and there is infinitely more complexity. However, I just need to understand the general philosophy of how employees who are fortunate enough to have benefits today would be affected by Medicare for all.",5,0.99,1584399723.0

Christine Lagarde, the current President of the European Central Bank and former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, called on European countries to take [“an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance” to combat the “weakened \[economic\] outlook” from the virus.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus) While governments around the world have coordinated their financial bailouts of the big banks and multinational companies, the governments of the world have done little to coordinate their response to the virus. For example, in a recent televised address, [Trump referred to the Coronavirus as a “foreign virus” and announced a travel ban on Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/europe-coronavirus-travel-ban.html). In his speech Trump tried to deflect criticism of his administration’s negligence in responding to Coronavirus, by blaming European leaders for the virus’ spread in the U.S. His argument was that they were not quick enough to ban travel from China, and therefore European travelers seeded the U.S. with the virus. In response to the ban, Gérard Araud, French Ambassador to the U.S., tweeted:

>📷[**Gérard Araud✔**@GerardAraud](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud) Trump needed a narrative to exonerate his administration from any responsibility in the crisis.

[1,378](https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1237916577858813959)[9:41 PM - Mar 11, 2020](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud/status/1237916577858813959) [Twitter Ads info and privacy](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256)

This blame-game is not isolated to the Trump administration. While politicians and officials in the EU like Christine Lagarde have called for unprecedented fiscal coordination in the EU, they have been unwilling to provide material and medical aid to other EU countries impact by the Coronavirus. For example, when Italy’s medical system first began to struggle with Coronavirus patients, the country requested assistance from the [Union Civil Protection Mechanism](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en), an EU Civil Protection Mechanism which has a mission to “improve prevention, preparedness and response to disasters.” [Not a single EU country sent Italy any medical supplies or assistance](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/).

This in part reflects how unprepared other European countries are for this pandemic. However, it also shows deeper lack of coordination between them in this time of crisis. This includes not only the lack of sharing of medical supplies, but also the uncoordinated nature of efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Countries increasingly seek to blame each other for mishandling the Coronavirus, and this is not limited to the Trump administration. For instance, [the European Union just put a 30-day ban on non-essential travel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/03/16/european-union-bans-non-essential-travel-for-at-least-30-days-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/#6d55a99b3544). While the central banks and governments of the world are coordinating a major financial bailout of the big banks and multinational companies, these same governments are also increasingly at odd with each other over how to respond to the virus.

This is not confined to Western countries. For example, Chinese state officials recently have been [spreading conspiracy theories that the US army brought the virus to Wuhan](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/3075227/why-china-amplifying-conspiracy-theory-blame-america-coronavirus). This is not an isolated incident, and [Chinese state media has increasingly been pushing this narrative](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1182694.shtml)[1](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/governments-around-the-world-prioritize-saving-big-banks-over-stopping-the-coronavirus/#fn:1). This reflects the interests of the Chinese state to use this crisis to its geopolitical advantage. In fact, the pandemic has also become a site of geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China. After initially praising Xi Jinping’s response, [Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the Coronavirus](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/donald-trumps-new-coronavirus-strategy-blame-china-130892). This is the logical result of years of sharpening competition between the U.S. and China.

Even one of the few examples of international aid by governments seems to be part of this logic of crude geopolitical calculus. Recently, [China sent medical experts and medical supplies to Italy](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3074682/china-sends-team-medical-experts-gear-help-italy-fight) to aid in the fight against Coronavirus. In a related initiative, [eastern Zhejiang province in China donated masks to help overseas Chinese in Italy](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-offers-medical-aid-to-italy-to-fight-coronavirus-chinese-foreign-minister). While framed by the Chinese state as a benevolent effort to help Italy and overseas Chinese there, the reality is that this part of China’s larger geopolitical strategy. In March 2019, [Italy joined China’s Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47679760).

The right-wing in the U.S. is [acutely aware China’s maneuvers globally during this pandemic.](https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-pillsbury-american-media-chinese-intimidation)

But despite their discomfort, as the Trump administration continues to mismanage the domestic, public health, and geopolitical aspects of this pandemic, it is likely that relatively basic maneuvers by China at this time will continue to boost its geopolitical strength and influence relative to the United States.

Over the weekend, the Federal Reserve announced another bailout, [promising to buy $700 billion in assets from U.S. banks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/15/coronavirus-fed-cuts-rates-zero-agrees-buy-more-bonds/5054943002/), while also lowering interest rates to 0% and taking other measures to aid big banks. The Federal Reserve also announced increased currency swaps with the central banks in Japan, Switzerland, the U.K., and Europe in the face of [a massive U.S. dollar funding shortfall](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-liquidity-markets/explainer-dollar-demand-reveals-markets-pain-point-idUSKBN210307) that has emerged due the economic downturn and the virus.

t3_fji4ch,CEOs are out...,"Here are some stats to consider:

**More than 1200 CEOs left their positions in 2019 which was a record year for exits.**

**In January 2020, 219 CEOs left their positions (which is also a record).**

Lots of investors are panicking, and it has been a bloodbath with the DOW experiencing it's worst day since Black Monday.

Chamath Palihapitiya, the former Facebook executive and billionaire who's fund Social Capital has delivered fantastic returns, has indicated that he believes the [downside target is around that of the 2008 financial crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT1N_48aX_Q) (\~50%).

**This is now the fastest bear market after an all time high in history**.

Looking at historical drawdowns and how many days it takes to reach the bottom of a bear market, it seems that the downside will continue.

This virus is serious stuff, and it is important to have cash and liquidity at this time.

One of the traditional hedging assets, gold, also plunged (apparently because hedge funds needed to cover margin calls).

**DISCLAIMER: NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE**

In the very short term, Cash is King.

In the short to medium term, I would expect gold and silver to do pretty well in the 1-3 year time frame.

In terms of a general approach for stocks, Dollar Cost Averaging in a Bear Market is generally the way to go - the question is ""how long could we go?""

Well, Chamath thinks a correction of the same level as '08 is possible - indicating that the S&P 500 could hit 1500-2000.

On a more qualitative basis, when Warren Buffett starts announcing deals is also not a bad time to start buying back in!

In the longer time frame (5-10 years), another asset that has had a *terrible* time recently is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is essentially a hedge against excessive fiat printing.

The response to this situation is likely to involve a LOT of fiat printing.

Therefore, perhaps it will prove undervalued in the long term (particularly as Central Bank Digital Currencies come into play).

They are not only at risk from the spread of the virus itself but also from the responses of the government, both local and national.

Homeless communities are highly social environments. Many encampments around the country are home to hundreds of people living in close quarters. Unlike formal residences, these informal settlements lack appropriate access to sanitation services. Running water, toilets, and even soap are not easily accessible to homeless people. [Public health officials are calling for social distancing and limited gatherings to slow the spread of the virus](https://www.newsweek.com/dr-anthony-fauci-says-he-would-like-dramatic-reduction-personal-interactions-social-1492410), but the reality is that many people are totally unable to do these things. This is all the more true for the homeless.

While the national response to the Coronavirus pandemic has been [slow](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/03/coronavirus-flawed-cdc-testing-kits-slowed-us-results/4930932002/) and [ineffective](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-coronavirus-response-fail-959868/), state and local efforts to combat the virus have also been problem-ridden. Such efforts are still far short of the seriousness of the crisis. Governments of the SF Bay Area have created [some local ordinances](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-san-francisco-emergency-mayor-london-breed/) to address the crisis. The City of Berkeley has placed [some hand washing stations at its largest encampments](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/13/berkeley-sets-up-22-hand-washing-stations-to-help-the-homeless-and-others-from-getting-coronavirus). Berkeley has even [leased land](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/02/26/mayor-wants-to-turn-homeless-camp-near-seabreeze-market-into-official-outdoor-shelter) to one homeless community, known as the “Seabreeze” community in West Berkeley, temporarily shielding them from further displacement and earmarking the community for expanded city services. However, these are mere pittances which do next to nothing to protect the homeless from this virus.

In 2018, Leila Farha, the UN Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing, visited San Francisco and was horrified by the conditions for the homeless. Noting how homeless people are denied basic access to water, toilets, and sanitation she said, [“The idea that a government would deny people those services …when they have nowhere else to go suggests a kind of cruelty that is unsurpassed.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/un-expert-san-francisco-homeless-cruelty-2018-11) Last year, an investigation by the New York Times concluded that the conditions for the homeless in Oakland were [comparable to or worse than the conditions in the slums of Mexico City](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/17/us/oakland-california-homeless-camp.html). In normal times, the homeless in the U.S. live in extremely precarious conditions, and face constant evictions and harassment from the government.

During this epidemic, the homeless will be particularly hard hit. Studies have found that with the exception of obesity, strokes, and cancer, [the homeless are far more likely to suffer from every category of chronic health problem.](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/Health.pdf) This includes diseases like diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, [which all increase the likelihood of dying from Coronavirus](https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2020/03/09/coronavirus-covid-asthma-diabetes-cancer/4962424002/). Given this situation, some minor improvements to sanitation like handwashing stations are unlikely to do much to deter the spread of Coronavirus among the homeless, especially given that recent studies have shown that [the virus has a significant ability to spread via airborne transmission](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay).

What’s more, given the history of abuse and oppression heaped on the homeless, it is likely that during this crisis they will be treated as potential vectors for the virus that endanger the rest of the population. Instead of the government working to provide them with housing and medical care, the homeless could be rounded up and treated as a public safety risk. Historically, the U.S. government has left many poor people to die during disasters. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, [thousands of poor, most black residents of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward were left to fend for themselves](https://www.democracynow.org/2005/9/5/survivors_from_new_orleans_speak_out) while the government focused evacuation and relief efforts on wealthy communities. When the government finally did offer assistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) housed around [30,0000 people in the Superdome, a sports stadium without proper plumbing, food, or supplies](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/08/refuge-of-last-resort-five-days-inside-the-superdome-for-hurricane-katrina). During Hurricane Maria [thousands of people in Puerto Rico died](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/24/763958799/2-years-after-hurricane-maria-hit-puerto-rico-the-exact-death-toll-remains-unkno) in part due to government negligence.

Residents in one of Oakland's largest encampments are well aware of this disturbing possibility. When asked how they felt about the situation, one resident of this encampment said, “they \[local officials\] have told us nothing, they could come and put us in FEMA camps.” This fear reflects the experiences of many homeless people, who already regularly have to deal with [violent assaults](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/violence-redefined-nyc-homeless-shelters-keeping-stats-article-1.3826801), [overcrowding](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/shelters-are-overcrowded-more-housing-needed-homeless-northwest-territories), and [poor health conditions](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/homeless-shelter-parents_b_1035952) in the existing shelter system. It’s not unreasonable to assume that during a crisis, they would be treated even worse by a system that already considers them disposable.

In the current crisis we can see the brutal way the state and national authorities treat people in general. A recent case where this came out was the management of a Coronavirus outbreak on the Grand Princess cruise liner. The cruise ship was off the coast of San Francisco, en-route from Mexico to the U.S., when it reported probable cases of Covid-19 onboard. [The boat was then in limbo for several days](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-diary-of-a-grand-princess-crew-member-as-covid-19-spread-on-the-ship), while president [Trump worried about whether letting the passengers debark from the ship would raise the U.S. number of Coronavirus cases and make him look bad](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-keep-passengers-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-2020-3?op=1). Eventually he agreed to let the passengers get off in Oakland, but at that point the virus had been spreading on the ship for days and days, certainly infecting more of the passengers and the crew.

A[lmost 3000 people disembarked from the vessel over three days, and the US residents aboard were shuttled to nearby military bases to be quarantined](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/03/16/coronavirus-grand-princess-departs-oakland-lets-off-crew/5058788002/). People in this situation were given little information on how long they will be detained, and many reported [dwindling food in the days leading up to their disembarking the vessel](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cruise-ship-guests-food-grand-princess-claims).

Negligent and authoritarian responses like this will only become more common as the situation intensifies. Furthermore, state and federal agencies are under more pressure to “do more.” Homeless people are some of the most vulnerable in our society. Both authoritarian crackdowns and a lack of action to protect the homeless will impact them even more. Given the response we have seen to Coronavirus so far, it seems likely that the state will mismanage this situation as well, putting many at risk through a mix of negligence and repressive measures.

Like, people have talked for a while about automation and things like that, but perhaps this is just going to be a shift that rapidly pushes us 20 years into the future. Because it's possible that this virus is going to require a quarantine of up to a year (essentially, when a vaccine is created), we might need to see a heavy ramp-up in the following:

- Office work becomes almost totally remote.
- Self-driving cars could enable automated delivery of goods. Also with so few people on the road now, they'd have a much easier time navigating without accidents.
- Industrial work becomes much more automated. This is accelerated by trying to bring automation back home so that critical parts of the supply chain in other countries can't be disrupted.
- Kids having to stay at home, people not going to the doctor's office, all of this rapidly shifts to distance learning, telehealth, etc.

Also sorry for any grammar mistakes you might have to struggle through.

So as we know companies such as Walmart, Target, Costco and more are keeping their doors open for the public (that is being asked to stay home) throughout the crisis that as of now has very minimal answers to an end. What if all these store closed their doors to public access but stayed open still as a source for items such as groceries and home goods. 

This would not allow any public access for those who might already have contracted the virus and help stop the spread of the virus. In Turn these stores can hire 10x to 15x the amount of employees they already have at minimum wage and set up a system to complete at home deliveries. 

***What about paying these employees?***

So yes this might take a toll on the balance sheet short term but the government can offer a huge tax break for these companies to pay them back overtime thus lessen some of the pressure and lower the total amount needed on the stimulus bill. The government would also pick up the gas charges for these employees but at the rate they are now that would be a such a small amount. The companies employing these new staff members would be able to gain back these expenses through a 5-10 plan of lower tax rates over time. Also the employees that do work for the company would still get a stimulus check but for less than the amount given to the rest of the country not working. The catch is once you add up the weekly check and the stimulus check they will end up with a greater total than those not working but also helps finance through these tough times by having a weekly check instead of just a monthly. 

***Now What about the employees being contagious?***

This is where the government needs to step up their game. All employees that are to be hired will have to be tested with negative results to be eligible to be hired. That way there is a guarantee that they will not be passing the virus to each household they are delivering too. One thing that could help with making sure these employees stay virus free is to use a local hotel and give them room and bored for free with the government paying for the cost of the rooms at some discounted price to allow these places to have some revenue instead of nothing. 

&#x200B;

***The benefits?***

To start this will keep all citizens out of crowded places and will have these items delivered to their home and never have to come into contact with the delivery driver. All deliveries will be delivered to the house by the end of the current day  or the end of the next day depending on the demand. With the vast amount of employees that they could hire with the unemployment rate quickly rising they will be able to hire to be able to meet the demand. Next the stores will take pressure away from the extremely hard working employees that are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked and ease pressure on the supply chains. Then comes the short term government spending. Yes this will cost a large sum but with what analysts are saying the government needs to spend some have the number upwards of 3 trillion dollars so this would lower that number considerably in the short term and then over time once we make it through this crisis the remaining amount will be paid back through time by those tax benefits and tax breaks. The economy will be back up and running in this time though so while paying these companies back they are making money to stay stable and strong. 

&#x200B;

There are so many more ways this can benefit not only the economy but the local communities that are involved. The companies will still be generating revenue for the products. Please if you know a better place that this should be posted feel free to repost this there or get the word around. I know there will be laws and licenses but the government can by pass these just for the time we are going through this. We need to step up and take the crisis seriously and stay in our homes with minimal contact with the outside to not only save our economy but also protect all of the citizens from what could become the next depression.",2,0.63,1584576972.0
t3_fly4r4,A Contagion Is Spreading Through the Economy Too,"As government agencies open the floodgates for bailouts and payouts, the sober reality is the present economic crisis is only going to get worse, and is quickly “infecting” supply-chains and financial systems already severely weakened by epidemic related work-interruptions.

A prescient framework for understanding “supply-chain infection” was mapped out in 2012, in a paper by risk consultant David Korowicz, titled [Trade-Off Financial System Supply-Chain Cross-Contagion: a study in global systemic collapse](http://images.feasta.org/2012/10/Trade_Off_Korowicz.pdf).

The paper examined how the interrelated nature of the global economy can quickly lead to massive failure because of the reliance of production of goods and services on a limited number of essential but vulnerable systems—in particular in the financial and energy sectors. The financial sector has already contributed to the compromised nature of our present economy because of a constantly increasing debt-to-product ratio. In other words, the amount of actual money being lent out in the global economy far exceeds the monetary value of actual goods and services, and this is particularly bad news in crisis situations.

If major agencies default on debt payments, the credit market could quickly freeze up. Withheld letters of credit could quickly threaten basic trade, as such guarantees are used to insure the safety of transactional agreements. This would lead to severe shortages very quickly. It is possible authorities may manage to stave off such a crisis in the United States, as they just barely managed to do in 2008. But even in this optimistic scenario, it would be unreasonable to believe the fundamental problems underlying the crisis would be resolved.

Furthermore, while the mess of our financial system in crisis will be difficult for authorities to untangle, Korowicz convincingly argues that production and supply-chain relations are *even mor*e complicated. The complex interrelation of goods and services required for creating the basic necessities of life, including food, transportation and other commodities, is nearly impossible to fully map-out. One example of this complexity is that on average 15,000 individual parts are necessary to produce a single car. The loss of even one critical component for producing such an item can lead to massive interruptions, as this would result in paused production on this and all other lines requiring that component, or which require components that incorporate that critical part.

This is already starting to occur, as large scale work interruptions around the globe are creating shortages of goods. In one case, Boeing’s 787 and 767 planes require parts from a manufacturer in northern Italy. General Electric, which supplies 90% of Boeing’s engines, also requires parts from Italy. Production of [a whole series of goods has ground to a halt in Italy](https://qz.com/1815731/italys-luxury-manufacturing-is-threatened-by-coronavirus/) while the country is on lockdown due to the Coronavirus. Coupled with Boeing’s ongoing safety and reliability problems, this has pushed [the company to the point of collapse.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/economy/boeing-coronavirus-economy.html)

Korowicz convincingly argues that the highly interrelated nature of our global economy *makes it even more vulnerable to crises*. In Boeing’s case, had the company maintained its traditional vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy (i.e. primarily in-house, U.S. based production of its various components) that it abandoned in the early 2000s, it would now face less immediate fallout from the present loss of production capability in Italy. Interestingly, the company’s move towards aggressive outsourcing was not merely part of a larger global trend, but was [promoted by its partners in the U.S. military](https://www.csmonitor.com/1996/1216/121696.us.us.1.html) in the mid 1990s.

Following the [hundreds of deaths resulting from the company’s 737 Max engineering disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/business/boeing-737-crashes.html), the company has tried to reverse its decades long shift away from vertical integration. However, [it has faced major obstacles in doing so](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-experts-suppliers-talk-of-pushing-up-jet-production-while-pushing-down-costs/).

While limited shortages have already been reported for food and other supplies, breakdowns in supply chains have likely only just begun. Stores and agencies generally have a certain reserve capacity on hand for sudden interruptions in supply or for increases in demand. Right now many stores and other businesses are using such reserves to restock depleted supplies, *but this will not be tenable long-term*. It is essential to grasp the non-linear impact of a crisis. Operations will increasingly fail because of a lack of cash-flow or because of a lack of labor. Already many people laid off from jobs are worried about how they will buy food even with a mostly stable situation at supermarkets at present. Disconcertingly, if food supply chains start to crumble, Korowicz states that cities only have about a three day food supply on hand at a given moment, and that without serious pre-planning, *authorities will not be able to establish alternatives for weeks.*

Likewise, the impact from serious disruptions caused by the last several days of U.S. work stoppages will have major implications in the weeks ahead. As Korowicz states, “Pandemic modeling has shown that removing at random only small numbers of a population can cause cascading failure of functions across an economy.” He states that these failures would soon threaten to disrupt the functioning of large infrastructure such as power plants. Such pieces of infrastructure require thousands of specific parts to operate, as well as specialized skills to carry out repairs, possessed by people who may well be unable to work now because of sickness or quarantine. The impact of disruptions are magnified when they occur in a major economic power such as the United States, which provides many irreplaceable skills and services to the global economy.

Such shockwaves are likely to increase in the near future, driven by an economic system made even more vulnerable by its reliance on debt. As Korowicz states “A contracting economy is incompatible with the credit backing the global economy.”

In one example of how the pandemic crisis is already cascading into a financial crisis, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Agency (MTA) yesterday requested [a federal bailout of $4 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-subway-federal-aid-.html). The MTA requested this nicely rounded figure based on a projected decrease of “$3.7 billion *from lost fares in the next few months*, should ridership trends continue” and for “coronavirus-specific expenses, like disinfecting subway cars and stations” estimated to reach $300 million.

These numbers do not add up.

According to the MTA’s own numbers, the agency collects about [$741 million in total fares, tolls, and advertising per month](https://new.mta.info/document/12481), meaning that the $3.7 billion figure is closer to a situation in which the number of NYC commuters *was reduced to zero for a five-month period*. And this is without even factoring in operating savings that would accrue to the MTA given reduced bus and train schedules due to future interruptions.

As the *New York Post* pointed out, the MTA is hiding its obvious debt problem. One of the MTA’s biggest expenses is simply paying back interest on a debt which is [projected to rise to $52 billion in 2023](https://nypost.com/2020/03/11/subway-riders-might-pay-for-mtas-debt-with-fare-raises-cut-service/), up from $35 billion last year. Simply paying interest on its debt approaches the total annual amount the agency pays for labor. As a result, a relatively minor immediate loss of revenue can be disastrous to the agency, making it unable to make payments to its creditors. Put another way, the agency even in normal times is barely solvent, creating a scenario in which a ripple, such as present difficulties, threatens to quickly submerge it and its financial backers, putting them beyond a point of no-return.

“The gist of it is that the risk of debt is just the same for the MTA as it is to a person,” said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, quoted in the Post’s article.“You can’t afford to have anything go wrong. You can’t lose your job. The MTA can’t have any setback of any kind or you won’t be able to pay off your debt.”

And the same applies to the economy on a wider scale. It is extremely vulnerable to disruption.

As Korowicz [stated in a blog post earlier this month](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-03-04/we-need-to-talk-about-catastrophic-global-risk/), “The government will no-doubt do everything they can to support businesses and the banking system with credit and stimulus, adding yet more debt to an already overindebted system. That will constrain future economic growth, increase the likelihood of future financial crises, and make the country less resilient to the next shock, from whatever the source. It is also straining political legitimacy, adding further uncertainty.”

In other words, the government will attempt to continue to plug up the vast numbers of holes in what amounts to a doomed ship, rather than creating a solid foundation to address the present medical and economic catastrophe.

Tellingly, as part of an apparent organizational hope within the *New York Times* that large-moves by the state and federal government can resolve the present crisis, the paper yesterday did not see fit to include any reporting about the MTA’s debt burden in its coverage of the agency’s bailout plea.

As crises continue to flare related to the pandemic, it is important to comprehend the even greater perils that may soon emerge. From Trump, to state government, to liberal critics, it seems that these risks presently are simply not being taken into consideration.

t3_flt12t,U.S. drug developer Moderna doses the first patient with coronavirus vaccine in an early-stage trial," 

Drug developer Moderna Inc said on Monday it has dosed the first patient with its experimental coronavirus vaccine in an early-stage trial being conducted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

Moderna’s study has made the most headway among efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop coronavirus vaccines as it is the first to be tested in human patients.

Its vaccine uses synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to inoculate against the coronavirus. Such treatments help the body immunize against a virus and can potentially be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines.

Moderna joins BioNTech SE, a German drug developer working on mRNA-based treatments, which entered into a partnership on Monday with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine in China.

BioNTech said it was in advanced talks with its existing partner Pfizer to develop the vaccine outside China.

Australian researchers also said on Tuesday they have mapped the immune responses from one of the country’s first coronavirus patients, findings the health minister said were an important step in developing a vaccine and treatment. Researchers at Australia’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity examined the blood results of an unidentified woman in her 40s and discovered that people’s immune systems respond to the coronavirus in the same way it typically fights flu.

The findings help scientists understand why some patients recover while others develop more serious respiratory problems, the researchers said. “People can use our methods to understand the immune responses in larger COVID-19 cohorts, and also understand what’s lacking in those who have fatal outcomes,” said Katherine Kedzierska, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Melbourne, which took part in the research. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.

By monitoring the patient, researchers were able to accurately predict when she would recover.

Health Minister Greg Hunt described the development as “world-leading” and a major development in research on the disease.”It’s about fast-tracking a vaccine by identifying which candidates are most likely to be successful,” Hunt told reporters. “It’s also about fast-tracking potential therapies and treatments for patients who already have coronavirus.”

Another German drugmaker, CureVac, aims to be ready by July to request permission for human testing of its experimental vaccine, while Johnson & Johnson has said it is optimistic it can start vaccine testing later this year.",2,0.75,1584701460.0

Earlier this week, the Bay Area [issued a “shelter in place” order](https://www.sfchronicle.com/local-politics/article/Bay-Area-must-shelter-in-place-Only-15135014.php), which directed everyone in the region to stay in their homes as much as possible.

*A graph of google searches for the term “martial law” over time*

In the U.S. martial law entails the suspension of the writ of *habeas corpus*, meaning that people would no longer have a right to a court hearing or trial if imprisoned. It grants the military broad sweeping powers, and if imposed it would likely mean that people would be required to go through military checkpoints to move between states or even around cities. In the history of the United States, martial law on a national-level has only been declared once. This was done by [Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.](https://lawi.us/history-of-martial-law/) After the Civil War, this decision was declared unconstitutional in the Supreme Court case [*Ex parte Milligan*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/71/2).

Martial law has also been imposed at a state-level numerous times, during the period of big political struggles such as [the Colorado Coalfield War](https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/coalwar.html), [the West Virginia Coal Wars](https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2018/09/buried-history-west-virginias-coal-wars/), and during [the Civil Rights Movement.](http://digital.archives.alabama.gov/cdm/ref/collection/voices/id/5382) In each of these instances, martial law was used as a pretext to crack down on people’s movements, to suppress dissent, and to prevent people from having a right to a trial by a jury of their peers. The U.S. government has been using the Coronavirus crisis to [roll back financial regulations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/coronavirus-economy-dodd-frank.html) and push for legislation which would [eliminate encrypted electronic communications](https://tech.newstatesman.com/security/earn-it-us-bill-end-encryption).

All of this raises real questions about the imposition of martial law. While it would be framed as a necessary step to fight the spread of the virus, we should be very wary of the government’s efforts to undermine our democratic rights during a crisis of this magnitude. The Trump administration’s initial response to the pandemic has been [widely criticized as being incompetent at containing the spread of Coronavirus](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/here-are-17-ways-the-trump-administration-bungled-its-coronavirus-response/). Trump repeatedly downplayed the dangers of the virus, [comparing it to the seasonal flu](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-coronavirus-flu-vaccine-us-pandemic-meeting-leonard-schleifer-a9371286.html). He even went so far as to [call it a hoax.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/trump-says-the-coronavirus-is-the-democrats-new-hoax.html) In a matter of days the administration’s response has shifted. Now they are considering martial law and a total lock-down of the country. While some may consider this a necessary step to fight the spread of the virus, the administration’s pattern of blatant disregard for the health and well being of the people during this pandemic raises serious questions about the imposition of martial law. The government’s [inability to do something as simple as increase testing capacity](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-per-capita-chart-us-behind-2020-3?op=1) also raises questions about how effective martial law would be at slowing the spread of Coronavirus. This sort of lock-down would necessarily entail a massive curtailment of civil liberties, and it would also set a precedent, justifying future use of martial law during times of crisis. All of this should give us pause.

## What is Stock Sentiment?

In investing, sentiment generally means whether or not given security is in favour with investors. It is typically a pretty short-term metric that relies entirely on technical analysis. That means it doesn’t incorporate anything to do with the health or profitability of the underlying company.

Price action is generally the best indicator of sentiment. For a stock to go up, investors must feel good about it. Similarly, a stock that is in a downtrend must be out of favour.

*InvestorsObserver*’s Sentiment Indicator considers price action and recent trends in volume. Increasing volumes often mean that a trend is strengthening, while decreasing volumes can signal that a reversal could come soon.

The options market is another place to get signals about sentiment. Since options allow investors to place bets on the price of a stock, we consider the ratio of calls and puts for stocks where options are available.

t3_flm7do,Why shares of Moderna Inc soared and why they will continue to do so," 

Last week, US stocks dropped firmly and settled in the connection territory as the threat from the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc among investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 9.13% between February 23 and February 28, recording the biggest two-day point decline in history on Tuesday and Wednesday. The S&P 500 lost 8.24% and the NASDAQ Composite declined by 7.09%. All three indexes lost all the gains from the beginning of the year and are now in the red year-to-date.

The main reason for the decline is uncertainty over the long-term impact of the coronavirus, that had not been priced into the markets. The growth in cases outside China is on the rise and the Centers for Disease Control issued a warning that Americans should brace themselves for disruptions related to the virus outbreak. Amid uncertainty and warnings from companies and analysts that revenue and profits will be impacted by consumer spending and supply chain issues, investors decided to rush to the exits.  
   
Additionally, it seems like Financial Advisors were looking for some silver lining and a number of new stocks made the list of most searched tickers last week. Among these, it’s worth to mention Gilead Sciences, inc. (NASDAQ: GILD), Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA), and Co-Diagnostics Inc (NASDAQ: CODX).

All three of these stocks captured the attention of Financial Advisors due to their involvement in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. Co-Diagnostics on February 24 obtained regulatory clearance for its Logix SmartCoronavirus COVID-19 test to be sold as an in-vitro test for the diagnosis of coronavirus in markets that accept CE marking as valid regulatory approval. In this way, Co-Diagnostics can export and sell the test in the European Union. The company plans to increase production to meet the demand.

Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) was in the spotlight on the back of two developments. On February 24, the company said that the first batch of its vaccine against the COVID-19 was shipped to US government researchers for a phase 1 study. The trial is expected to start in April, around three months from the vaccine design. Two days later, Moderna posted its fourth-quarter results, which showed a 60.2% annual drop in revenues to $14.1 million and a net loss of $124.2 million (up by 13.8% on the year). Nevertheless, the stock spiked on the back of the financial report, as investors were excited to learn about the company’s progress in Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and coronavirus vaccines.",6,0.99,1584668009.0

t3_fp1284,Thoughts on the Economy and the Market,"I just posted a comment in another thread and wanted to expand on it and get thoughts from others as I watch the economy and stock market and try to anticipate what they will do. 

The stock market is a claim on future profits of companies. Even after this crash the [price per dollar of earnings is $18.63](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)  per dollar earned over the previous twelve months. The historical  average $15.78 per dollar of earnings. So, the stock market is still  expensive. Of course, the next twelve months are likely to see a  decrease, not an increase in earnings, making stocks even more  expensive.

I think that the recent  bump comes from hope that congress will pass the $2 Trillion stimulus  package. My guess is that will help in the short term but lead to  problems with inflation over a longer period of time. There will just be  more dollars chasing fewer goods. OTOH we have deflationary pressure in the form of a demand shock; with potentially three million unemployed the $2 Trillion will not make up for all of their reduced demand. The question then becomes the relative size of the reduced supply of goods and services relative to the reduced demand for goods and services. I think that the supply shock will be bigger, especially given how interconnected global supply chains are. Can anybody offer a better idea of what might happen?",2,0.75,1585180184.0
t3_fosfa1,Can the Federal Reserve directly distribute funds to individuals?,"Given the ongoing shutdown of the economy it's difficult to ensure SMBs, individuals, and capital intensive industries will have the capital to continue servicing debt.  If these entities were to default the Federal reserve would likely need to act with quantitative easing to preserve the financial system and correct for any capital destruction.  


There are a few options to deal with this;  


1) The Treasury provides bailouts, and benefits sufficient to prevent defaults using bonds that the Federal Reserve has purchased using freshly created capital, leaving a debt on the federal government's books.  


2) The Federal reserve pushes interest rates to 0 or negative using freshly created capital, enabling entities to acquire bridge loans, and rollover debt to avoid bankruptcy.  Some of the freshly created capital is distributed to the financial sector in the form of fees and interest rates - and entities have to grow their balance sheet.  Individuals and some corporations will go bust due to failing loan eligibility requirements, or failing to meet them in sufficient time.  


3) The Federal reserve directly pays loan servicers for debts, either fully or partially for a finite period of time - Entities balance sheets shrink, and financiers are kept whole, however freshly created capital is fully disbursed into the economy - and can't be easily taken back without rate hikes, and increased reserve requirements.  


4) The Federal reserve directly distributes capital to individuals, for a finite period of time - to counter the deflationary effect on demand.  Consumers in turn distribute capital to business entities and allow them to continue basic operations.  Entities balance sheets shrink, some corporations (airlines) and hard to reach individuals go bust due to persistent lack of demand during a pandemic.  


While options 1 & 2 are actively in use, I haven't seen any thoughts towards options 3 & 4.  Has there been research on the legality/practical effect of a central bank directly distributing capital to individuals to increase the money supply and fight deflation?",2,0.67,1585150918.0

So I thought the recent HUGE dive in stock is because people were worried... They needed their money liquidated JIC annnnd they didn't trust most companies to thrive through this time. (On top of all that, people panicking led more people to panic.. when people saw the huge hit in the economy, others lost faith and took THEIR money out too, and so on... Or was that just the depression?) And now Trump recently announced that he hopes to 'open America back up in Mid April', the stock market went up a good bit.. I assume THAT was because people's faith increased annnnd stocks are cheap rn so it's a good time to buy...

t3_foo684,Can we save the economy via financial hibernation?,"Is it possible to place the economy in an induced coma / suspended animation / financial hibernation to save the economy from catastrophic collapse?

Australia has already budgeted almost $200 billion towards a covid 19 rescue package, and the USA is proposing figures of $2 trillion. These are astronomical figures, and we haven't yet fully confronted the problem. What will be the final cost for Australia? $500 billion? Is even $1 trillion a possibility?

Will these rescue packages save those small and medium sized businesses that are going broke? What will the economy look like in 3 months.  Will there be any jobs to return to?

Can we imagine working together to save us all?  
How flexible is western democracy in times of crisis like this? How resilient is the free market. How effective is our political system?

This will sound crazy! But what if, we locked down all financial activity for 3 months. During this period, no money is to change hands. No company or individual gets paid for anything. No company or individual pays for anything. Bank accounts are frozen. The stock market is closed. No small business needs to worry about paying the rent for an empty shop. No commercial property owner needs to worry about paying the mortgage. No money changes hands. All financial activity is frozen. The federal government is temporarily the only customer in Australia. Only the federal government will credit selected suppliers for all essential goods and services needed during the hibernation period.

3 months should be more than enough time to extinguish the threat with an effective social isolation program. During this time, everyone stays home except for strictly essential services (doctors, pharmacists, grocery stores, police, logistics etc.). Food and other essentials are provided as welfare by the federal government, and are delivered to homes and dropped off at the door. (Or possibly collected from shops in a staggered system of supply - letter of your surname determines day of the week for shopping, etc).

3 months later, when the virus has run it's course,  all financial activity is resumed. Shops reopen. Employees return to their old jobs. People start paying their mortgages again. Tenants start paying their rent. The financial position of all companies and individuals will be exactly as it was prior to hibernation. We lose 3 months productivity, but we don't lose our jobs and the economy.

What might this 3 month hibernation cost the country? Will it cost more than $200 billion, or $500 billion? I don't think so. The Australian economy at full capacity only generates $350 billion in a 3 month period. In hibernation, it may cost less than $200 billion, and in the end, everything returns to normal. No business needs to go bankrupt, no employee needs to lose their job.

This may sound like communism, and its certainly very draconian. But it seems to me one way of saving the country from economic disaster.

Discuss.,"So from case studies, wages rise as immigration slows, because their are less low and mid level workers to take jobs, companies have to compete with each other by offering better wages to win those workers.

We grow our GDP through mass immigration, providing an influx of workers which allow businesses to expand by opening new branches, but then wages dont increase because there are too many workers there's no incentive to pay them more.

How can we work around this problem?

An enforced minimum wage is one way but there are conflicting studies some showing evidence that it leads to higher joblessness and slow economic growth, whereas others show it helps.

>**The Pros Outweigh the Cons Up to a Point**
Some research shows that a minimum wage can increase the number of jobs in an economy. Businesses find other ways to offset higher labor costs. They raise prices or reduce the number of hours worked. Worker morale, productivity, and consumer spending all increase.

>But the pros only outweigh the cons if the minimum wage isn’t too high. Wages cannot be so high that they reduce a company's ability to keep labor costs low during a recession. In setting a minimum wage, the government has to find the sweet spot between protecting workers and giving businesses the flexibility they need to remain competitive.

t3_fq9yn9,Why economic stimulus HAS to go to the bottom of the pyramid.,"So I find it odd there is this attitude out there that we need to give money to big businesses so that ""The jobs will be there when this is over"" If there is demand for a good or a service, there will be a job to produce said good or service. That is economics and it has been true since the dawn of time it will not change because of COVID-19.

To be clear - I am not against fiscal stimulus at ALL. It is EXACTLY what we need to do in a situation like this. But the money needs to go to poor and middle class people and here is why. One dollar of stimulus will be treated in the following ways:

1. 100% of the stimulus you give to a poor person will be spent and put into the economy.
2. 95-98% of the stimulus you give to a working class person will be spent and put into the economy.
3. About 30% of the stimulus you give to the wealthiest population will be spent, the rest will be either saved, or invested. Which is CRUCIAL to an economy. I'm not a socialist but here's the difference:

In a situation like this where you have an abrupt absolute halt in the economy every dollar you spend has to be on keeping the economy afloat and functioning properly.

This stimulus will be profitable for businesses in the sense that the money spent in the economy will work it's way UP the pyramid through profitable business. If you give stimulus to wealthy people to invest in a situation like this it will either:

1. Not be spent or invested and just saved, which doesn't accomplish what you wanted to. or 1:
2. Is invested in a new business venture which is either, doomed to fail since every dollar is being spent on essentials OR is invested into businesses that provide essential services but there is still a time lag, only being half as effective.

TLDR; Fiscal stimulus NEEDS to go to the bottom of the pyramid and work it's way up through profitable businesses in situations like this because 99% of that money - A much higher proportion that wealthy populations - is spent on the economy.

I don't know much about economy, so I'd like for an expert to try and explore this scenario (hopefully you can forgive my ignorance if I'm not precise or outright wrong).

Can a country, in time of crisis, suspend the economy so that stuff like public debt, stocks, all that, remains the same until the crisis ends, and the economy can be restarted? What I was thinking in particular is that after suspending those things, the government would take control of the infrastructure and productive capability of the country and basically just use those without spending money or paying for anything, just use the resources available in the country itself. Workers could be incentivized to work by making them not pay taxes for a year after the crisis ends, for example. People wouldn't pay for anything, they just receive a predetermined amount of necessary goods (eg food, water) and request other things based on need (eg clothes).

The reason why I was thinking about this is that to me it seems absurd that governments try to keep up and running a system which clearly can't work in these conditions, people can't really spend and make money flow through the system. So maybe by switching to this new ""resource-based"" system, the government can actually focus all the available resources on what matters, like providing hospitals with equipment, providing labs with whatever they need to study the virus and enforcing quarantine. And after the crisis ends, the economy can restart like it was before, without worrying about repercussions caused by funneling billions from into it.",5,0.86,1585568915.0
t3_frm0mu,What Is Being Stated Here And Does It Make Sense?,"So I'm in an argument with some people on economics, when someone posted this big beast dump of text in claiming economic freedom/free market is self-defeating and that the market should be run by the state? I think? I'm not 100% sure what this person is saying to be honest but I could use some help in understanding if what's being said is right or not, and what might be the best responce:

>Economics isn't basic. Pretty much all of the basic requirements of basic economic theory are malleable, which introduces complexity, which makes any and all basic theory invalid. Supply, demand, public opinion, competitor viability, vendor freedoms, mobility of goods and services and customers... pretty much everything can be manipulated by those with the power to do so, and power has many vectors, but they all have the same thing in common, those with it will desire to have more of it, and possess the means to acquire it in such a way as to increase the power differential between them and those with less. The free market is a pyramid scheme. It is more complex than the archetypal pyramid scheme, and even has money flow down, but on the large scale it occurs at a consistently uneven rate. Yes, there are exceptions, but on the large scale it remains consistent that ""the rich get richer"" because they possess the means, motive, and opportunity to do so, and ""the poor get poorer"" in relative terms is an inevitable consequence.

>Here we come to the real failure of the system, the poor steadily lose resources relative the optimal standards, and thus lose the ability to express themselves financially. While basic economic theory doesn't describe the overall system at all, it does still describe some events on the smaller scale, especially amongst those with less opportunity to exploit the system: those with the least power. People at the poorer levels require economic expression in order to facilitate their requirements in order to continue functioning, and they steadily become more and more marginalised until they are completely marginalised, such as occurred in ""the global financial crisis"" with a bunch of economic professionals exploiting financially inexperienced and desperate people into loans that they couldn't manage, but were largely necessary because they weren't meeting their requirements regardless, and putting them into debt was more profitable than leaving them alone to be financially starved into literal inability to take part in the market. Like all pyramid schemes, it is dependent upon the lowest level to continue to provide profits, when a pyramid scheme becomes universal, it cannot feed itself, and swiftly dies from the bottom up as each level finds its dependencies shrivelling up beneath them.

>The free market has been attempted, poorly, and failed catastrophically every time. State-run economies have typically been run by dubious governments (largely as a result of them being a massive shift and requiring revolution, but clearly are an economic phenomena, rather than a political phenomena, and thus could function under most any government that doesn't have an explicit economic component, which is sadly all too common), and almost always have clear external pressure explicitly opposing them, but have a tolerable track-record when operating on the small-scale such as with voluntary social special-interest-groups. Free markets on the other hand have often occurred on the small scale, and seen some adoption on the larger, and always crash. People accuse these crashes of being events with specific causes, they are not. Economic crashes are the product of the dependencies being disempowered to the point of desperation, and are corrected by massive welfare-state-in-all-but-name movements to correct the imbalance. The inevitable stable state of the free market is slavery-in-all-but-name as corporations find their employees steadily less and less ""competent""(read: insufficient funds to operate independently) and thus requiring more and more assistance, which inevitably progresses into running their entire life, which inevitably progresses into ""or else"" at which point their freedom is completely curtailed, but the perpetually expanding proportion of people too poor to function independently, well, those of them that are compatible with the standardised service, are maintained arbitrarily to a functional state, and thus able to continue to service the economy. Why hasn't this already happened? Because people do not like that idea, and propaganda and robotics have not yet attained the necessary technological advancement.

>We could go to the classic farming community example. Two equal(hah!) bakeries (we won't be going into why there are two when one would comfortably exceed the requirements and two results in significant overhead) operate in the hamlet. The grain harvest arrived at the end of summer, each bakery bought and stored their own grain to their own granary, at which point the farmers all shipped all of their grain to the big city to immediately exchange raw goods for reinvestment opportunities. One bakery bought four times enough grain to last a season, the other enough for but one. One bakery made a season's worth of bread and put it up for market, while preparing to do the same for the rest of the year. One bakery had twice the available funds and directed those into a crier outside the main hall to bring in customers, and a professional baker and exotic ingredients to make deluxe breads, and refurbished their shop to look clean and comfortable, and bought tables for people to loiter around their business and provide social pressure to remain there... but gaining many complimentary factors converging, they spend twice the money for four times the effect which cycled back into the public mind to reinforce itself to 8 times the market share. One of these bakeries got no business, and went out of business, and was then bought by the other, which now had all of their competitor's grain stores, so the hamlet starved in the winter and had to buy grain from the big city at an unsustainable markup and then they went out of business too and everyone starved to death in the spring. But wait, how did they starve when they bought their competitor's grain? Why, because their competitor wasn't stupid enough to prioritise the long term when failure to prioritise the short term is fatal, and with a competition-based system... it always is! So nobody bought enough grain! Ain't the prisoner's dilemma grand!

>The sad truth is that freedom is self-defeating. Two computers that can calculate every possible chess move have no freedom. Two grandmasters who know the game to a level most people don't know anything use only the tiniest fraction of the possible moves. Two amateurs who just want to take pieces have a vast array of options. The amateurs have more freedom. Freedom, taken to extremes, always results in universal competition. Competition always results in a cost to suboptimal actions, and all costs being cumulative. To have any choice in one's conduct, one must have the opportunity to engage in suboptimal actions, which cannot exist in a society dedicated to freedom. If someone is free to use their time, and spends it upon, say, recreation, or the wellbeing of their children, then some amongst their peers will dedicate more time to their professional standing and take the available promotions, at which point it will become evident that the first someone is less effective(due to their demonstrated inability to gain promotions), and they will be further relegated to irrelevance(see: age discrimination). If one's employment is state-mandated, then they lack the freedom to dedicate their time towards professional success, which grants them a far greater freedom in how to allocate their time. Freedom, left to its own devices, is self-defeating. Effective freedom is only found when freedom's excesses are constrained. Freedom is a vital and valuable component of life, but an absolutely appalling ideal. Thus, I propose that libertarians, those who seek freedom, should seek to minimise the influence of competition upon one's ability to participate in society.",2,1.0,1585551461.0

Last week James Bullard, President of the St. Louis Fed, said that [GDP could contract up to 50% in Q2 2020, and that unemployment could reach 30%.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/unemployment-surge-to-30-percent-q2-gdp-50-percent-james-bullard-2020-3-1029022288) Major banks have put out [similar analyses](https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/markets/morgan-stanley-sees-us-economy-plunging-30-25-in-second-quarter/ar-BB11yajt). The impact of the economic downturn and work interruptions are being felt across all sectors of the economy. Last week [U.S. unemployment claims skyrocketed to 3,280,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-unemployment-idUSKBN21D1WJ), a 3 million increase over the previous week. This means that around one percent of the entire U.S. population filed for unemployment last week. This shattered the previous record of 695,000 unemployment claims in a week, which was set in 1982.

The number of unemployment claims [will likely increase in the coming weeks](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/26/a-word-about-the-horrid-spike-in-unemployment-claims-and-why-its-even-more-horrid-than-it-appears/). The numbers from last week are from the claims that were filed on the week ending March 21st, and therefore do not reflect the number of people who filed last week. During the week of the 21st, [many state unemployment websites crashed](https://news.yahoo.com/state-unemployment-websites-crash-applications-150200792.html), preventing people from filing online. As a result, many of these people ended up filing for unemployment this past week. What’s more, the $2 trillion stimulus package includes [provisions which allow gig workers such as Uber drivers to file for unemployment benefits](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-relief-act-expanded-unemployment-payment-and-eligibility.html) as well. This is a welcome change, and long overdue, but it does mean that we can expect that unemployment claims will continue to climb in the coming weeks. And we are still only at the beginning of a crisis that is [expected to last for 18 months](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/there-isnt-going-be-all-clear-signal/608512/). Italy was unable to contain the spread of the Coronavirus even after imposing social distancing measures similar to those in effect in the U.S. right now. In a last ditch effort to stop the spread, they ultimately decided to [shut down all industrial production for at least 15 days](https://news.yahoo.com/germany-drops-deficit-dogma-deaths-184032455.html).

While the measures taken here in the U.S. do not entail a complete shutdown of industrial production, the U.S. elite and especially the big capitalists are not thrilled about the prospect of a similar shutdown. Last week Trump said that [“America will again and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting.""](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/trump-coronavirus-lockdown-skepticism-143800) He also stated that [he wants to see “packed churches” on Easter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2020/03/27/churches-easter-trump-closed-coronavirus-services/). He has since [walked back this goal](https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/trump-extends-social-distancing-measures-to-april-30-walks-back-easter-reopening-plans/ar-BB11SH5q). Despite this reversal, Trump has not been the only one pushing to rush everyone back to work during the pandemic. His statements are not isolated incidents, but represent a growing trend among the U.S. elite, who stand to lose billions in future profits and lose global influence if the shutdown continues.

For example, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, recently tweeted that ‘[Extreme measures to flatten the virus “curve” is sensible-for a time-to stretch out the strain on health infrastructure. But crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue-and beyond. Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.](https://twitter.com/lloydblankfein/status/1241907502662418437)’ On Fox Business, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow recently stated that, [“There’s no question we have to think seriously. I would say, after the 15-day period is over, which I guess ends after this weekend, we will take another look at targeting areas \[to reopen businesses\] that are safe enough.""](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/larry-kudlow-trump-coronavirus-business-restrictions-15-days) Big capitalists like Bob Luddy (founder of CaptiveAire systems) have argued that if [the U.S. doesn’t “get back to work” by March 30, it will be a total disaster](https://spectator.org/back-to-work-by-march-30-a-coronavirus-imperative/). Right-wing talkshow host Glenn Beck, even went so far as to state, [""I would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working\[...\]Even if we all get sick, I'd rather die than kill the country.""](https://www.salon.com/2020/03/25/glenn-beck-tells-older-americans-to-get-back-to-work-id-rather-die-than-kill-the-country/) He also noted that he hoped his comments trended on social media.

It’s not just billionaires, libertarians, and right-wing news networks who are pushing these ideas. The New York Times recently ran an opinion column by Thomas Friedman, a columnist at the paper, [in which Friedman made similar arguments](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/coronavirus-economy.html?fbclid=IwAR2j6dA_UUUABRCZEj7vqtq0uydKuq5elicaAKstv3BKbb_VMaLhLSyP1_w). A few days before that, the Times [ran a similar opinion piece by David L. Katz](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html), president of True Health Initiative and the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal recently [published an opinion piece that made a similar argument](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rethinking-the-coronavirus-shutdown-11584659154).

While there is not yet a complete bipartisan consensus on this issue, it is concerning to see a large section of the U.S. elite so openly proclaiming their willingness to let millions die to further their political and economic interests. If people are rushed back to work before the pandemic has died down, or before there is a vaccine, this will lead to a massive outbreak and the unnecessary deaths of millions of people. This would be akin to responses during the 1918 Flu pandemic in which some places rushed people back to work and hosted big public gatherings, which led to [massive spikes in the weekly death rate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/03/how-cities-flattened-curve-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-coronavirus/).

Criticism of this push to get people back to work during the pandemic have primarily [focused on how this prioritizes profit over the lives and well-being of people](https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/03/27/i-will-not-kill-my-mother-for-your-stock-portfolio/). This is an important criticism. It exposes the logic of the present social system which serves the interests of the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the poor and oppressed people. These exposures are all the more important during times of crisis when so many are in dire straits both from the virus itself, and also the looming economic depression. However, it is also important to see that push to get everyone back to work is not just about driving the stock market higher and maximizing corporate profits. The U.S. elite have a series of economic and political interests which are related to, but not reducible to maximizing their profits and driving the stock market higher.

For example, competition between the U.S. and China has been intensifying in recent years. This has manifested in many ways including the military build up in the South China Sea, and the ongoing trade war. Right now, the U.S. elite are worried that [the Coronavirus could reshape the global order](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order) and allow China—which seems to be recovering from the virus—to overtake the U.S. as a the dominant global superpower. Major think tanks and policy circles have speculated that if China recovers from the virus before the U.S., then the former [will make big political and economic inroads into regions like the Middle East at the expense of U.S corporations](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/03/covid-19-impacts-on-strategic-dynamics-in-the-middle.html). They are also concerned that China could strengthen its relationship with [European countries like Italy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/) by providing them with economic and medical assistance during this crisis.

The push to get everyone back to work is also related to the U.S. elite's concerns about [major disruptions to global supply chains](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/a-contagion-is-spreading-through-the-economy-too/). Some key industries are already [shutting down some production](https://www.postandcourier.com/health/covid19/sc-automakers-temporarily-closing-manufacturing-plants-due-to-coronavirus-supply/article_25e08da2-6aa5-11ea-9056-af6c129aca07.html) due to supply shortages. There is [growing concern about what is known as the bullwhip effect](https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2020/03/12/coronavirus-supply-and-demand-economic-effect) in supply chain engineering. The basic concept is that as one supplier attempts to adjust to new changes in demand and available parts, like those caused by the present crisis, relatively smaller misadjustments by this initial supplier can lead to even bigger miscalculations down-stream or upstream. The metaphor to the bullwhip is that a small change/disruption—like a flick of the wrist—leads to bigger changes down the line, like the movement at the end of the whip. This is already playing out in multiple ways throughout the economy.

For example, many hospitals have urgently been requesting supplies of personal protection equipment, such as masks and gloves. While there have been steps to address these shortages—such as [automanufacturers shifting production to make ventilators and masks](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/two-gm-plants-will-build-ventilators-masks-to-help-fight-covid-19-pandemic/ar-BB11O17H)—other shortages throughout the medical system have been neglected, [including medicine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/critical-inhaler-medication-shortage-looms-coronavirus-cases-soar/story?id=69759965) and [many other medical devices](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-supply-chain-update). In the end it is likely there will be an oversupply of gloves, and [undersupply of](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/03/02/coronavirus-outbreak-will-lead-to-more-drug-shortages-in-the-us-including-antibiotics/#3b425623320f) these other products.

On a larger scale, the initial outbreak of Coronavirus in China and the related economic downturn there [led to major disruptions in production and supply](https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/trade-lanes/trans-pacific/coronavirus-could-delay-normal-post-cny-trans-pac-flow-march_20200210.html) of made goods made in China. This led to a [significant loss of profits to producers there](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-industrial-profits-idUSKBN21E08I?taid=5e7da812e370aa0001622e7d). It also led to major [disruptions in supply for manufacturers around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/hyundai-south-korea-coronavirus.html) who rely on parts and equipment made in China. Following a partial recovery from the pandemic, many businesses and factories in China have quickly invested in the reopening of operations throughout the country, assuming that their international customers would purchase the same approximate quantity of goods that they did before the crisis. However, faced with [declines in demand because of economic crises in the U.S. and Europe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already), these factory owners may experience even further losses on investments. They are already beginning to face issues [due to reduced demand from Europe, the U.S., and other parts of the world.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already) In the face of this downturn, some may overcompensate in other direction and drastically cut back production to a degree that leaves those who require their products with no choice but to look elsewhere, or to go out of business.

Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the Rand Corporation [recently noted that the impact of production disruptions in Europe on the U.S. economy will be even more significant than the impact of earlier disruptions in China](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/03/the-economic-wallop-of-covid-19-qa-with-rand-experts.html). He stated, “Think about this: China is a major trading partner, and its shutdown negatively affected a lot of U.S. businesses. But the United States receives only 15 percent of its imports from China and sends only 7 percent of its exports to China. We send 34 percent of our exports to the EU and receive 30 percent of our imports from the EU. Now those economies are shut down. Our neighbors Canada and Mexico are also major trading partners with us, so our economic health will depend in part on theirs as well.

Given the non-linear nature of supply-chain disruptions, there is growing worry that economic disruption from the virus will lead to major shortages of important goods, [including a possible world-wide shortage of food](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns). This is growing concern because workers in key food industries are [falling sick with the virus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/food-workers-getting-sick-is-the-latest-threat-to-world-supply). Close quarters and dangerous working conditions make many food factories and slaughterhouses especially dangerous environments during a pandemic. Government officials around the world are already expressing concern [about food riots](https://thewire.in/food/pronob-sen-karan-thapar-coronavirus-food-riots), and last week the Red Cross agency warned that the Coronavirus could [spark mass unrest among West's urban poor](https://news.trust.org/item/20200327134620-yc7e3). The U.S. elite are especially worried about their ability to contain this unrest, given that [police forces across the country](https://apnews.com/069d01bafbb1f15b1f6c4a4479ab1456) and [members of the military are falling sick](https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/other/sailors-on-warships-like-uss-theodore-roosevelt-vulnerable-as-coronavirus-spreads/ar-BB11S7WV).

These are just a few example of the complex series of reasons that Trump and other members of the U.S. elite are pushing to get everyone in the U.S. back to work. The capitalists and politicians are of course concerned about the stock market and corporate profits, and it is important to critique them for [prioritizing profits over human lives and well being](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/03/capitalism-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-19-single-payer). This is an essential feature of capitalism, even during periods of relative stability. However, during a crisis the contradictions of the system intensify, and its logic is laid bare. It’s important to understand the complex dynamics at play and not oversimplify the situation. The maneuvers of the ruling elite not only show that they value profit over the lies of the poor and oppressed people—something which they have made abundantly clear long before this crisis—but also that they are deeply concerned about how this crisis will impact their power, both geopolitically and domestically. In other words, the U.S. elite’s response to this crisis shows not only their greed and callous indifference, but also the fragility of their rule.

t3_ftmt5p,"Apple Shipments, How Much Could It Fall Amid Coronavirus Outbreak?"," Without a doubt, the COVID-19 pandemic has roiled equity markets. And the downtrend trajectory that started in late February might extend further in the near term as governments continue to take stocks of the economic impact of the outbreak. Some countries have closed their borders and announced lockdowns. Thus, consumers are spending less on non-essential goods and services and delaying purchases. Then, they expect this to hit the top line of a few companies by a significant margin. A tech giant, set to face a considerable drop in revenue, is Apple. The firm makes the majority of its flagship product, the iPhone. Last December quarter, iPhone sales increased by 7.7% to $56.0 billion and accounted for 61% of overall revenue. With that, the demand for the company's new lineup of smartphones mainly driven the growth. However, on February 17, Apple unveiled a statement confirming that the firm will miss the quarterly guidance issued during the last earnings call. Also, Apple attributed the shortfall to a constrained iPhone supply and a slow production ramp-up in its manufacturing sites in China. These headwinds have the capacity to depress Apple's results beyond the current quarter.

With debt levels being where they are, the money must move fast. We all know that key lobbyist and businesses with savvy finance teams will be the first to gain access.

t3_fuvt48,Covid-19 pandemic is ushering two important (positive) revolutions,"those two revolutions are: insourcing, and WFH (work from home). 

1) **insourcing**: far more than Trump's trade wars, this pandemic has truly damaged the credibility of ""Outsource everything & your mother"". 

.

No, this does not mean China loses its pre-eminent position as the Factory of the World (FOTW).  China after all will always have far superior scale & logistical efficiency & political will to remain as FOTW.  However, it does mean that insourcing is now politically viable across the entire world: people and even capitalist corporations are seeing the true dangers of a) over-relying on just one country, b) and under-relying on your own home country.  Right now, insourcing our medical supplies & machinery are getting most of the attention (as they should), but soon our insourcing attention will turn to other important products in our society. 


(side note: one day, i dream of a world where our spell-check software recognizes ""insourcing"" as an equally legitimate word as ""outsourcing"".....FFS)

.

b) **WFH**: this is the big one.  Just think of what an enormous set of changes that WFH will usher into society.  here are some examples:

- Less driving = downward pressure on gas prices; your cars & car parts last longer; roads & highways last longer; traffic (both personal vehicles & public transit usage) is less crowded; parking lots don't need to be so huge; less accidents, which means less insurance claims & less tragedy; better mental & physical health (sitting in cars is bad for you!); many people will realize they dont need cars & might give them up.

- more family time = less daycare demand & expenses; stronger parent-child bonding; stronger couple bonding (for healthy couples) or higher divorce rates (for unhealthy couples); less home insurance claims (because many home insurance losses happen because nobody's home) 

- more home computer usage = higher demand for residential internet bandwidth (esp if streaming), higher residential electricity usage

- more distance between home & work locations = cheaper housing (more willing to buy/rent a place that is much farther away from your job, so long as it's cheaper)

- other effects: less contagion for common diseases like flu & cold; even school students could have the possibility of remote classes. 

(important note: the ability to WFH is a key differentiator between white collar vs blue collar jobs)

so here's an example: imagine your white collar job is downtown, but your employer allows WFH 4 out of 5 days per week.  Why the hell would you rent inside expensive downtown, when you can get a much cheaper place 1+ hour away? after all, you'll only commute once a week!

here's another example: we've all seen those insane videos of Tokyo's trains being packed like sardines. but now, even many conservative Japanese corporations are forced into WFH...how awesome it would be if Tokyo trains lost 25% of its traffic, in an average workday?

t3_fvcapv,SBA Changing Wording Of The Cares Act To Reduce Relief To Small Business Owners,"You'll see on the media that they're complaining about the Payroll Protection Program not having a 100% successful launch, but what you're not seeing is the gross mishandling and miscommunication of the second relief part of the bill otherwise know as the EIDL loan ($10,000 grant). The ""$10,000 Grant"" that all the policymakers were parading about has now been changed by SBA against the Cares Act to ""Up to $10,000 based on # of employees"" This significantly reduces the aid that sole proprietors desperately need and this was one of the intentions of the law makers. In addition the law was written so that everyone who applied gets this loan regardless of application approval or denial to get funds out to small business owners because they are one day, one week, one month away from closing down. HOWEVER SBA has now changed this part of the law too and rewritten it to ""3 days after application has been processed"". And don't even think about calling in to ask SBA customer service reps because people have been getting completely mixed answers on [r/smallbusiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/) from multiple reps with even some reps admitting that they have no idea what's happening.

So far, Senator Sanders, Schumer, Coons, and Cardin has written a direct letter to the SBA regarding these issues with a couple of others, but we need some more exposure to bring light to this issue.

t3_fxsr8x,"Sleeping better now that I got that economy won't ""restart""","Covid19 outbreak is a first in modern history, and sincerely evaluating it's impact on business and designing safeguard plans for the companies i'm working with took a toll on my nights starting mid January to... Last friday. 


My job is to assess risks and improve our organisations, it's based on several things : reliable data, statistics, prospective, disruptive change management and psychology. Those are the skills on my resume, but, in fact it's an easy job : being a sponge! Observing, listening, without plan or bias, and if you are lucky understanding and learning. 


And last Friday I really did my job and all the little elements fell in 3 unbiased reasons why my personal opinion is we should stop thinking about recession or depression. Since the 12th March I had the deep feeling that the world had change. It's now a belief founded on 3 key factors I hadn't seen in any reports (neither Eurasia group, nor bcg's nor anyone article or report so far) all the other points are valid, but my job and personal experience lead me to always look for root causes, and covid isnt the root cause of economic congestion.


Those 3 little things are just unprecedented things, happening at the same time, in our modern world. One of those alone is recession material, but 3?


- All our Western ""1rst world"" systems had been developped on one factor: since several thousand years now, human follow the rules if and only if their basic needs are guaranteed. That's Maslow's pyramid's base. 
The most interesting with Maslow isn't the pointy figure everybody knows, its the text! 
And only few people read the text when there's a schematic. In short, every slight perceived threat on the lower level automatically drops you to this level. 
Covid does that. 
And everything in our modern west world is based on the given assumption were at the point or just below. 
Climbing back will take neither months nor years but decades. 

- Lloyd's of london closed its trading and underwriting floors for the first time in its history. We're talking of a first in 334 years. 
That, more than all the volatility of markets we witnessed makes me believe covid did something no war ever did so far... It's a real life event that had a significant impact on finance. This isn't even meant to happen! That just goes against the concept of economics and worst : we witnessed the hand in action. Noone ever whitnessed Adam smith's hand in action, that goes against the concept of invisible hand! That will have repercussions. 

- The supply is a long chain. We're working hard since the 50's to polish every link, improving those one by one in a complete lack of coordinated effort. Yes but... This chain in its mere design is meant for accellerating, its concept is pulling the flux. 
Slowing down can't happen and when way less impacting events happened it took us years to recover. Today links are tearing or collapsing because of covid. Airfreight relies on goods flying below passengers, sea freight relies on boxes circulating flawlessly between countries. Global business relies on offer correlated to demand... Tail effects will take their toll. As i said my job is to evaluate risks and ensure they're dealt with, but my kind isn't allowed to dive really deep (and in the system as it was working, it would've been overkill). Most of us evaluate sustainability of our providers, the most advanced goes up to rank 3, and that's something I hadn't witnessed much. Here I'm affraid of the long tail, the small company making an essential component amongst hundreds of the white ink used to print my keyboard's keys letters... 

So the only possible conclusion, when you take all those facts is: restarting economy as we knew it will be the costlier option, and odds restoring it to its former level are really low. 

I'm just sleeping better knowing that, because my job is to find solutions, the most effective ones, the quickest to deploy ones... And in this specific case, when you really look at the details to make the big picture (which is actually my job, despite being counter intuitive with the neurotypical way of dealing with reality according to neuroscience), there's no solution to restart and restore what we knew. 

That means we finally have reached a world of endless possibles and we can design without constraints! 

Well I'm sleeping for now, that won't last! Egoes will kill this! At the top and at the bottom! Soon I won't sleep again, egoes will force me to deploy bad solutions in a desperate attempt to get back to what was. Because people don't like uncertainty, and possibilities. You can't assess what can be, only leaders do that, and there's not much of them, covid is proving that point. 

Soon my peaceful nights will be over, but I'm enjoying the perfection of this momentum. After all there's absolutely no way to forecast anything knowing 3 of the maybe 5 foundations of our civilization had been challenged.

I'm a QA expert not an ingeneer, I don't design planes, I make sure they don't crash! 

I'm a QA expert I observe, I listen, and if I'm lucky I understand and learn.

All of these models assume that once we have passed the peak and cases go down the number of cases won't go up. The only reason cases have gone down is due to nationwide lockdowns that have destroyed the economy.

To improve the economy you need to lessen the lockdown. With the relaxation of laws comes great risk. There is no rule that states that the once you’ve flattened curve once, it can’t shoot straight back up.

A lot of talk about herd immunity and Sweden and how countries might be better off with a percentage of their population immune.

A very interesting article summarising SIR models and indicating that medium level immunity (say 10% of a population) does very little in reducing the spread without other measures. They basically go through the maths and look at countries data to arrive at a sobering conclusion. We need long-lasting infrastructure and a reduced economy to get through this. We can't rely on herd immunity.

t3_fzzm1w,Nassim Taleb Advised Universa Investments (Tail Risk Hedge Fund),"**A tail-risk hedge fund advised by Nassim Taleb, author of “The Black Swan,” returned 3,612% in March**, paying off massively for clients who invested in it as protection against a plunge in stock prices.

The fund, Universa Investments, was founded in 2007 by Mark Spitznagel, who is also runs the fund as the Chief Investment Officer.

Nassim Taleb is Universa's Distinguished Scientific Advisor.

From 1999 to 2004, Spitznagel and Taleb ran Empirica, a hedge fund which applied very similar tail hedging strategies to Universa.

Universa made huge gains in 2008 - as the S&P 500 dropped 38.5% by the end of 2008, the fund increased its investors's money tenfold.

Of course, even when a recession hits, Universa's investors won't starve - they have enough money to invest more than $50 million, which is Universa's minimum investment, and this will be a relatively small part of their overall portfolio.

Universa essentially offers a ""black swan protection protocol"", telling clients to think of the fund as catastrophe insurance that allows them to pursue returns more aggressively, without the need for more traditional approaches to risk mitigation.

Mark Spitznagel, who runs the fund, is known for the phrase:

**""I spend all my time thinking about looming disaster""**

In fact, a [Forbes profile from 2011](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0627/money-guide-11-spitznagel-black-swan-cnbc-protect-tail.html#5349ecbe3857) claims that on roughly 95 trades out of 100 they lose money, yet Spitznagel is unruffled as he sits in his office listening to classical music and losing money each day.

**To simplify, here's the essence of how it works:**

**Universa purchased far out-of-the-money ""put"" options on stocks and broad market indices.**

**A put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a set price within a specified time period. It's a bet that a stock or market is going down.**

As it is ultimately a bet, it is a very attractive market for degenerate gamblers!

If the market price falls below the agreed-upon price, you make money.

Universa makes a lot of small bets and watches most of them go bad (hence the 95 out of 100 trades they lose money line).

However, when one hits, it hits big...

**For example, back in September 2008, when the S&P 500 was trading around 1200, Universa bought S&P 500 Index put options with a strike price of 850, due to expire late October.**

**They were betting an “unlikely” drop would occur.**

**They paid around 90 cents for those options. By October 10th, the S&P had dropped 300 points in a month. The options Universa purchased for 90 cents were now trading for $60 each. Universa cashed out of its position around $50, good for a gain of 5455%.**

Now, as a reminder, this is a hedge - investors will have a relatively minimal percentage of their portfolio in Universa.

Essentially, the fund is designed to make an absolute killing if the market crashes and therefore ensures that their investors have insurance if the market suddenly nosedives.

Speaking of diving, let's take a dive into the [Investor Letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/455607584/Universa-Letter-April-2020#download&from_embed):

In what has been a terrible period for many investors, this is what Universa investors were greeted with on the first page:

**Based on your required invested capital at the start of the year, in March 2020 you experienced a 3,612% net return on capital; year-to-date you have experienced a 4,144% net return on capital.**

Spitznagel then flexes The Risk Mitigation Scorecard, which showed that a portfolio invested 96.7% in the S&P 500 and *just 3.3%* in Universa's Tail Hedge fund, would have had a positive return in March, a month when the S&P dropped 12.4%.

The same portfolio - which eliminates the adverse effect on compounding from downside shocks - would have produced a 11.5% CAGR since inception in March 2008 versus 7.9% for the S&P 500.

(CAGR just means Compound Annual Growth Rate)

I mentioned eliminating the adverse effect of compounding from downside shocks, well this is crucial and he makes a great point here:

**Due to the mathematics of compounding, the big losses are essentially ALL that matter to your rate of compounding, not the small losses - and** ***not even*** **the big or small gains.**

This goes back to Warren Buffett's wise words:

**""Rule number one: Never lose money**

**Rule number two: Never forget rule number one""**

TLDR: Inflation is a very real concern that economists are worried about from the government's intervention in the economy. In the US, the current M0 Money Supply is much higher than it has been within the last few months from the stimulus package and other economic intervention. 

Because of concerns over the value of the dollar, economists suggest investing in ""real assets"" like productive land, shares of a well-managed private business, and ETFs or physical gold and silver. Precious metals tend to be the most accessible for everyone, and silver and juniors are expected to catch up to the success of gold.

As the video explains,  I get that the Fed can't directly hand over the money to the Gov't and that they can either 1) buy financial assets and/or 2) buy Gov't bonds (treasuries) but when the printer goes 'Brrrrr' and magically say a 1 Trillion USD$ comes fresh out of the oven, do they literally use the physical M1 money they just printed and then go to the physical markets to buy these financial assets/treasuries with the new cold hard cash in massive briefcases?

Are they trading like an institutional investor buying/investing into individual stocks, ETFs, hedge funds, etc?

>…  
>  
>It is impossible to get large groups of people to perform sustained labour effectively and consistently for years on end simply through doling out pain and raw terror. Even the most brutal of slaveholders were therefore compelled to develop a sophisticated system of management that exploited the most human aspirations and fears of the people they dominated.  
>  
>Creating divisions between slaves was essential to this. Enslaved people outnumbered free whites in the British Caribbean. In Jamaica the ratio was higher than 10 to one, and on some big plantations it was about 100 to one. Managers therefore needed to divide slaves in order to rule over them. The slave trade from Africa provided them with one opportunity. As a manager of several large Jamaican sugar estates remarked in 1804, it was a general policy to ‘have the Negroes on an estate a mixture of nations so as to balance one set against  another, to be sure of having two-thirds join the whites’ (in the event of an uprising). The theory behind this was that enslaved people from one African ‘nation’ would refuse to join rebellions plotted by those  from others, or by creole (locally born) slaves, choosing instead to serve their white masters in the hope of rewards for loyal service.  
>  
>Privileging some enslaved people above others was another [effective](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144039X.2014.944032) means of sowing discord. Slaveholders encouraged complex social hierarchies on the plantations that amounted to something like a system of ‘class’. At the top of plantation slave communities in the sugar colonies of the Caribbean were skilled men, trained up at the behest of white managers to become sugar boilers, blacksmiths, carpenters, coopers, masons and drivers. Such men were, in general, materially  better-off than field slaves (most of whom were women), and they tended to live longer.  
>  
>The most important members of this enslaved elite were the drivers, responsible for enforcing discipline and work routines among the other enslaved workers. These men were essential to effective plantation management—a conduit for orders and, sometimes, for negotiations between white overseers and the massed ranks of field workers. They were also among the strongest [survivors](http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15720.html) of the system.  
>  
>The privileges conferred on the enslaved elite came in several [forms](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03071020500304627): better food, more food, better clothing, more clothing, better and bigger housing, even the prospect (in some rare cases) that a master might use his last will and testament to free them.  
>  
>…  
>  
>The various privileges extended to the enslaved elite helped to create a conservative attitude among some—keen to protect what they had gained. They also produced an aspirational culture, of sorts, within the slave community—a bleak and tragic shadow of the ‘American dream’ of independence and riches that motivated the slaveholders. Those slaves who lived long enough and were not physically or psychologically broken by plantation work could aim to join the ranks of the skilled, privileged plantation elite. …  
>  
>…  
>  
>And their stories remind us that they were all trapped. However complex and divided the slave community, however many people we find who were able carve out precarious positions of relative comfort, we find them struggling to live within a system designed to promote disunity, anxiety and fear. …

t3_g8amaj,Social Capital 2019 Annual Letter,"First for some context, Social Capital was founded in 2011 by former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya, whose net worth is *not* $1.2BN (it's many multiples of this according to Chamath).

The venture fund invested in a range of companies over the years, perhaps most notably of which was their investment in Slack.

In mid-2018, they closed to outside capital and became a technology holding company.

According to Chamath, this decision was made in order to take a more long term approach and avoid the perils of the short term fee generation game that is prevalent in the venture capital industry.

As always, Chamath provides some interesting insights in the [Letter](https://www.socialcapital.com/annual-letters/2019).

**Part 1/5 - Modern Gilded Age:**

First off, Chamath makes the argument that we are currently in the later stages of a modern Gilded Age.

The Gilded Age was an era of rapid economic growth in the United States from the 1870s to around 1900.

During this period there was rapid economic growth, wage growth, immigration and expansion of social programs.

The major industry of growth was the railroads, and a class division started to emerge with the 1% owning more than 25% of all property and the bottom 50% owning less than 4%.

Chamath argues that there are many similarities between the Gilded Age and today - both economic and societal.

But what came of the Gilded Age?

Well, the excesses and lopsided nature of the Gilded Age ushered in the Progressive Era, which was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States that spanned the 1890s to the 1920s.

As well as addressing the problems caused by industrialising, urbanisation, immigration and political corruption, the Progressive movement also sought regulation of monopolies (trust busting) and corporations through antitrust laws.

Of course, Chamath is not the only high profile investor to highlight the [importance of looking to the past for lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5LqCAtNJJ4).

Chamath highlights the rise of populism and the increasingly loud calls for change.

Therefore, in this context, the last few years seem very much akin to the beginning of the end of our modern Gilded Age and the beginning of a new Progressive Era.

**Part 2/5 - Tech Regulation:**

The question is: which companies will be broken up and when?

Drawing on the comparison with the Gilded Age, Chamath states that the only way to effectively reign in Big Tech is via trust busting.

He expects Big Tech to be broken up within the next 5-10 years, with Facebook being first on the list.

Chamath also highlights the importance of making sure that Big Tech doesn't find a way of helping write the regulations such that they can promote and cement their monopoly.

Moreover, Chamath describes the value created by Big Tech as an increasingly decaying function, while the need for true progress is increasing.

The combined R&D budgets of Big Tech total more than $600BN in the last decade.

""Big Tech promised to change the world and eradicate its evils, but it's clear that it isn't happening as they seem more focused on protecting their monopolies than advancing humanity.""

For some context, the cost of the *entire* Apollo program was $25BN (or around $150BN in today's dollars). However, Big Tech spent $75BN on R&D in *2018 alone*.

**Part 3/5 - The Market:**

Chamath then gives his take on the market, stating that central banks have exhausted their ability to meaningfully manage inflation, in either direction, but that doesn't mean that stock prices won't continue to go higher via unnecessarily cutting rates and flooding markets with money.

""Our simple framework is this: as money gets cheaper, the credit markets continue to expand because CEOs become motivated to artificially boost Earnings Per Share. They do this by buying back stock, seek bad acquisitions, make poor capital allocation decisions or avoid taxes. All enabled by borrowing massive amounts of essentially free money. It shouldn’t surprise you to know that these decisions also result in ever increasing CEO pay.""

Basically, Earnings Per Share is net profit/number of outstanding shares - so when companies buyback their own shares the number of outstanding shares decreases and therefore the denominator decreases and therefore Earnings Per Share increases.

Now because many CEOs have bonuses that are tied to hitting a certain Earnings Per Share, this leads to an obvious incentive for corporations to buyback their own stock.

It is little wonder that Corporations are the dominant source of equity demand.

In the words of Charlie Munger:

""Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.""

**Part 4/5 - VCs:**

""VCs are increasingly motivated by the incentives of up-rounds, bigger funds and fee-based compensation. The flood of fast money has created a surfeit {pronounced surf-it} of these overnight practitioners with questionable sources of capital and even more questionable backgrounds.""

""Big Tech raised a total of $1.345BN in venture capital before going public of which $1.3BN was Facebook alone. This means that Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google raised less than $45MM *combined* before IPO. Even on an inflation adjusted basis, this is incredible and tells something very important about a raft of today's startups.""

**Part 5/5 - Performance:**

It's safe to say 2019 was a pretty good year for Social Capital.

The returns in 2019 lifted their inception to date performance by more than 350bps.

Since inception in 2011, they have compounded their money 997%, beating the S&P 500 (with dividends reinvested) by more than 3 times.

In 2019, they generated more than $1.7BN in cash and cash equivalents.

Chamath states that liquidity will be increasingly important over the next few years.

""Selling, when appropriate, and generating cash in a thoughtful way seems to be a prudent decision for the next several years.""

In 2019, they completed two transactions:

The first was an investment of more than $500MM into Virgin Galactic, thus creating the first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company.

Chamath is tight lipped about the second company, but describes it as ""an acquisition of a venture backed company that had raised almost $100MM of traditional VC money.""

In the Letter, Chamath compares the first 8 years of Social Capital to the first 8 years of Berkshire Hathaway.

However, [even Chamath agreed that the Berkshire Hathaway comparison was slightly misleading](https://twitter.com/bornaVC/status/1237181119277088768) \- as the ratio of Berkshire Hathaway performance to the S&P 500 was around double the ratio of Social Capital to the S&P 500 over their respective periods.

Nonetheless, still pretty good!

t3_g9q20u,"Ok, so can someone please explain to me how the US economy is going to recover so strongly after COVID-19, when we have all of this going for us?","
1. We're at the highest consumer debt rates since recovering from the Great Depression.

2. Federal deficit could hit $4.3 trillion and over 20% of GDP this year: The Federal deficit was on track to be over $1 trillion without any additional spending for the coronavirus this fiscal year. Now with the $2 trillion CARES Act, the $484 billion relief package and $134 billion for the Families First Act, the CRFB also estimates that, “nearly $600 billion in additional deficit spending as a result of feedback effects from lower economic output, slower inflation, higher unemployment, and lower interest rates” will occur. 

3. Oil storage is filling up, we're having to stop production, prices have fallen 75% (and even went negative for May contract, possibly will happen for June contract as well), showing that consumer demand for travel is at all time lows. We don't even know for sure how long it will take demand for travel will come back to 2019 levels, and they could be at low levels for years. 

4. Market is already overpriced. P/E levels before COVID-19 were already elevated above average levels, due to being in a bull market for 10 years. It is very unlikely that with all of the sustained pressure on the economy that P/E levels will be able to go much higher from the ""P"" side. Most likely they will jump higher when earnings are reported this coming month, on a downgrade of the ""E"" side. 

To me, it seems like the overall markets are prime for a long sustained recession, and yet they're currently holding on to relatively minimal losses YTD. I know they're reacting to monetary and fiscal policies, but I'm worried that due to most companies not giving future guidance on earnings, that the earnings estimates are still way too high. I believe that once earnings start to be divulged (especially in financial sector), the market will begin to turn downward. 

Think about it this way: Our federal debt has multiplied nearly 4x this year alone. How are we going to pay for that? Not by cutting taxes for years coming out of this... nope, quite the opposite, or we'd need to reduce federal spending on other programs for many many years. What happens when you reduce federal spending? Depends on what you're cutting, but it means potentially: job losses (of which we're already going to be at Great Depression levels coming out of this), people going hungry, infrastructure degradation, etc... 

This is going to be a very difficult path to recovery, and people are just not internalizing that yet, I don't think the market is either.

t3_gatl67,HELP - Ancient Babylonian Infinite Lending Techniques,"Hello all,

Please help me find a book extract that tells about the lending technique that I'll try to the best of my abilities to explain below.

**TL;DR**: Infinite lending cycles make it so the lender always earns money from interests, and the borrower always has the need to borrow more money, so the lender can keep earning from interests ""ad-infinitum"".

Backstory: 

Some years ago I read a book extract that detailed how Babylonian temple priests were amongst the first to develop a lending technique which has been widely used throughout history and is still used in this modern day era.

&#x200B;

I'll give a simple example below to detail the logic utilized by said temple priests to develop this form of lending (numbers and proportions are not real and are contextualized to give this example).

Introducing: **Farmer A**

Following a flood or a crysis, Farmer A is left with 50currency and all the readily-eatable crops he has left are barely enough to feed his family for 10 days.

For him and his family to survive, he needs a minimum of 5 currency every day to pay for his expenses, on top of the readily-eatable food he already has.

Farmer A knows that, after 10 days, he will run out of currency and out of food.

Farmer A also knows that his new crops will be ready to eat after 20 days.

Farmer A knows that he cannot possibly last for 10 days without food nor currency , because he would risk starvation and death.

On top of the above, if Farmer A had 10currency to spend every day, he would be able to have a currency surplus to reinvest in new crops, and in the long term he would be able to recover from the crysis, having enough food to provide for his family every day and some excess food to sell and earn more currency.

Now, to the **temple priests**:

The temple priests, amongst other things, acted as bankers, and knew that by giving longer loans they would earn more interests.

The temple priests also knew that in the event in which Farmer A would repay all the credit he borrowed, the ""temple bank"" would stop earning money from interests.

The priests then quickly realized that, when possible, if they managed to keep Farmer A in a very long borrowing cycle, they would then keep earning interests for a longer period.

**The above translates in the temple priests lending just enough capital to Farmer A so that he can pay his day-to-day expenses and survive, BUT never enough capital to allow Farmer A to recover from the crysis and stop having the need to borrow money.**

This way, in an almost never ending cycle, Farmer A would need to return to the priests every X time to borrow more money.

t3_gdzcfo,Warren Buffett and the Stock Market Crash,"Warren Buffett made headlines recently after his recent [virtual Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69rm13iUUgE).

Buffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN. Berkshire *had* held sizeable positions (around 10%) in the major US airlines.

As well as this, Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3BN from $128BN at the end of 2019.

Clearly, as he is selling at a significant loss, Buffett believes that there is further pain ahead for the airlines. 

The GOAT is not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy...

Moreover, his cash position indicates that he doesn't believe that we have reached the stock market bottom yet, although he wouldn't give specifics.

Others however are more explicitly bearish.

The numbers are certainly [not looking good](https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/)...

&#x200B;

**TRUTH 1/2:**

[1640 CEOs left their posts in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/2019-had-the-most-ceo-departures-on-record-with-more-than-1600.html), the highest year on record since tracking began in 2002.

For context, there were 1484 exits in *2008* when the country was embroiled in the financial crisis.

This trend has continued in 2020, [in January a record 219 CEOs left their posts](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/rapid-ceo-turnover-continues-with-a-record-number-of-top-executives-departing-in-january.html), the highest month on record.

The economy was going to crash anyway. It was inevitable.

However, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.

People will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.

To highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.

Last year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America ""exceptionally un-self-critical""

Warren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: ""Never bet against America""

In other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.

&#x200B;

**TRUTH 2/2:**

As smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:

""Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.""

[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. 

On a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. 

A [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&source=bl&ots=OT8xAOp_-y&sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&f=false) stated: 

""Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.""

According to a senior Salomon trader: ""Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.""

Yes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.

Overall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.

When everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. 

At the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...

t3_gdr9ye,"Increasing National Debt, Decreasing Consumer Spending, and the Tax Multiplier.","Considering the current debt the United States is taking on and the possible long term reduction of consumer spending, what do you think will be the effect on taxes based on the Tax Multiplier (or other factors open to discussion).

&#x200B;

**Background info:** [Tax Multiplier (better) Explained](https://xplaind.com/544502/tax-multiplier)

The Tax Multiplier represents "" the multiple by which [gross domestic product](https://xplaind.com/484044/gross-domestic-product) (GDP) increases (decreases) in response to a decrease (increase) in taxes. There are two versions of the tax multiplier: the simple tax multiplier and the complex tax multiplier, depending on whether the change in taxes affects only the consumption component of GDP or it affects all the components of GDP.""

&#x200B;

You can use these formulas to observe how a decrease in spending and saving might affect taxes.

&#x200B;

*TMs =MPC/MPS =MPC/ 1 − MPC*

Where,

*TMs* is the simple tax multiplier;

*MPS* stands for marginal propensity to save (MPS); and

*MPC* is marginal propensity to consume (or mC / mY, where mC = Marginal consumption and mY = marginal income)

and/or

*TMc =MPC / (1 − (MPC × (1 − MPT) + MPI + MPG + MPM))*

**(This formula accounts for other parts of GDP)**

Where,

*TMc* is the complex tax multiplier;

*MPC* is marginal propensity to consume;

*MPT* is marginal propensity to tax;

*MPI* is marginal propensity to invest;

*MPG* is marginal propensity of government expenditures; and

*MPM* is marginal propensity to import.

(""c"" meaning complex)

From **my interpretation**, what this means is that the less we spend, the less the country produces, the more debt we take on, and in order to cover debt faster, taxes are going to have to be raised. Further, granted that Income Tax is one of the largest sources of revenue for the government, do you think we might raise taxes else where? This is obviously a complex issue, but i think it would be cool to hear what everyone has to say.

&#x200B;

In addition, despite the stimulus payments, our country is producing less and therefore our GDP is dropping. Because our GDP is dropping, our debt is growing.

&#x200B;

*TL;DR*: i think we might be paying higher taxes or our country is just gonna stay red forever lol

time to find other sources of income besides working a job.

But i felt the underlying reason has to do with everyone focusing on investing their productions in China, i'm not saying it's China's faults, because it is what the rest of the world decided that they have the capacity & cheap labor to produce decent products.

However the recent 10 years China has been aggressively expanding globally, and entering new markets, this might at first seem as a good thing for countries involved as they are investing, however it feels like unlike the western countries, China takes more than it provides to the local economy. For example, Chinese company prefer to hire workers straight from China, instead of relying on local workers (unless there is restriction), because Chinese workers are cheaper and believed to be more efficient & reliable (due to also being Chinese), and the Communist believe in contributing to the mother land, as such they try to keep their money back in china as much as they can, and these workers generally spend little in the local market, as most of them buy most of their things from China (even food materials), so the most they spend would be on rentals & fresh produce. Unlike western expats who spend alot of money to help with the economy and hire majority local workforce to offer more job opportunities.

Chinese companies (usually builders) would also often bring in their own cafeteria and import their own food materials, and of course raw materials, because simply it's cheaper. So they pretty much buy nothing locally. Most contractors are also Chinese firms unless they are forced to engage local companies, so what we see is Chinese companies coming into different countries and taking away job opportunities for local companies and people.

What we see is more and more companies moving out of many countries and focus on China, because they pretty much have everything. Hightech R&D will be done in their own nations, this leave majority rest of the world with much less business opportunities. With less business opportunities comes less jobs, and with people out of jobs, what follows next would be recession.

I'm not saying China is the bad guy here, but what they are practicing is something like Dracula, and unlike Developed nation, instead of helping local economies, they seem to drain them dry.

Countries know that, but they still focus on China, even though they know they should start looking elsewhere, because simply they are just too cost effective, everybody just trying to hang on as long as they can, but it'd be too late.

Every country needs China, but China doesn't really need most of the countries. China shuts down, everyone suffers. Over relying on China has caused many countries to shrink in economy, and this Covid19 Pandemic is pretty much a nail in the coffin for many companies that is still contemplating on whether to close down or pull out.

Covid is just going to make its way as part of our life. Everyone knows vaccines take a long time. So the only option is triage and treating the affected.

Business will resume as normal, just with some precautions.

Govts will start pumping more money into the health sector to mitigate the risks (so maybe buy some healthcare stocks).

Insurance premiums will likely go up due to increased risk.

corporate taxes will rise as a way to offset the bug payouts that happened.

This may lead to additional job loss added on to the ones that remain permanent from this recent cut.

Small business will disappear, maybe make their way to other online platforms( this will create opportunity in the delivery side). I can imagine small businesses servicing customers through contract type work if customers exist outside of their regional area.

t3_gh8bja,Gold standard? Federal Reserve?,"Gold standard? End the Federal Reserve?

I'm pretty sure this has been debated before and asked a lot in this forum but pardon me being new here.

I am a history major and have been trying to read as much about economics as I can during my spare time. I'm about finished with Gregory Mankiw's *Principles of Macroeconomics* and plan to read his *Principles of Microeconomics* soon enough. I have also read Thomas Sowell's *Basic Economics* and am about halfway through reading Henry Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson.* I have also recently seen Milton Friedman's *Free to Choose* and also plan on reading his works, as well as Friedrich Hayek and Frederick Bastiat.

One of the topics I really want to delve into is in regard to the merits of having a Federal Reserve and whether it is more beneficial to go back to a gold standard. I think that there is an economic consensus that the money supply has a great correlation with the level of inflation and the value of the dollar, as the more that is printed, the more worthless the dollar becomes, and the less printed it is, the more worth it becomes. Particularly also, fiat currency tends to be valued only in, so, far, as there is confidence in the financial systems.

For this reason, there seems to be two issues and questions at hand. The first one is if it would be more beneficial to go back to a gold standard? I understand that there are various ways in which this could occur. This could include going back to the physical use of gold as money, pegging the dollar back to gold, or begging it to some other commodity such as Bitcoin. The purpose of any of these approaches is to control the money supply by something that is finite and hence limited in nature.

This seems to solve the problem of controlling the quantity of the dollar. Some have criticized the gold standard due to the overly restricted circulation of currency that has historically led to deflationary, as opposed to inflationary periods, which could be just as devastating as inflationary periods.

The second question and problem concern the Federal Reserve. To what extent is it beneficial to have a Fed? Should the Fed be reconstructed, and or more heavily regulated? Should we outright do away with the Fed? Or should the Fed be kept the way it is? On the one hand, it makes sense in theory to have an institution such as the Fed to help regulate banks, ensuring that things such as bank runs, and or banking disasters are preventing. It also seems sensible in theory to have an institution such as the Fed, which is independent of the government, to help in coordinating monetary policy.

However, in practice, it also seems that the Fed has often been the cause of such disasters such as the Great Depression and the Great Recession by creating boom and bust cycles through arbitrarily changing interest rates, and through its various tactics at influencing monetary policy and controlling the money supply. A similar, yet different issue would be laws passed by the government encouraging risky lending such as forcing financial institutions, whether private or public to give out bad loans to risky people such as those who can't afford to take the loan.

Would it not make more sense to simply let the ""invisible hand"" (the forces of supply and demand) to allocate the money supply and interest rates? If there is more demand for borrowing this will push interest rates up, as banks and other financial institutions would want to charge higher interests and they would ideally want to be careful as to who they are lending money to. If there is a greater demand for saving than lending, this would push interest rates down as banks would not want to give out as much money in interest and other financial institutions would want to encourage more borrowing.

I would appreciate any resource recommendations whether they be books or other media platforms that you think do a good job at tackling any of these two issues.",3,0.72,1589140707.0

t3_gi9547,Elite College Endowments,"One day after President Trump criticized them, Harvard University announced that they [would not be accepting the $8.6 million in taxpayer money](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/harvard-trump-coronavirus.html) that the university was set to receive as part of an emergency relief package for higher education.

Other elite universities, such as Princeton, Stanford and Yale also announced that they would not be taking the money designated to them through a $14 billion federal aid package for higher education. The money was part of a $2 trillion relief package that President Trump signed into law on March 27th.

This criticism centred around the endowment size of the elite US universities:

**Harvard has an Endowment of $40.9 billion, the largest in the world.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.9 billion to the university, representing 35% of Harvard's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, the largest allocation was to hedge funds, which returned 5.5%

Followed by public equity, which returned 5.9%

Followed by private equity, which returned 16%

**Yale,** [**thanks to David Swensen**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-09-11/david-swensen-made-yale-fabulously-rich-and-changed-endowments)**, has an Endowment of $30.3 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.4 billion to Yale, 33% of Yale's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, Yale is currently targeting a 30% allocation of the endowment to market-insensitive assets (cash, bonds, and absolute return). Absolute return just refers to value-driven and event-driven hedging strategies such as long/short equity, distressed investment and special situation investment. They are designed to have lower volatility over time.

It also seeks to target a 53.5% allocation to illiquid assets such as venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, and natural resources.

**Stanford has an Endowment of $27.7 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.3 billion to the university, representing 22% of Stanford's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, it is mainly Private Equity, Absolute Return and International Equity.

Private Equity refers to investments in private companies, ranging from startups all the way up to leveraged buyouts.

**Princeton has an Endowment of $26.1 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.4 billion to the university, a massive 64% of Princeton’s total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, it is mainly Private Equity, Real Assets and Independent Return.

Real Assets refers to real estate and natural resources, and Independent Return refers to hedge funds or, in superior Ivy League speak, investment vehicles that seek high absolute returns that are typically independent of broad market trends.

**According to Henry Hansmann, Professor Emeritus of Law at Yale Law School,** 

**""a stranger from Mars who looks at private universities would probably say they are institutions whose business is to run large pools of investment assets and that they run educational institutions on the side that can expand and contract to act as buffers for investment pools.""**

As well as this, many top US universities were [implicated in the Paradise Papers](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/08/us-universities-offshore-funds-endowments-fossil-fuels-paradise-papers) for using offshore funds to grow their endowments.

104 US universities and colleges were named in data from the law firm Appleby, with four of the top 10 schools by endowment named in the files: Columbia, Princeton, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania.

Most contentiously, some of the offshore funds invested in carbon-polluting industries, despite leading US universities playing a key role in the fight against climate change...

Let's take a look at an example:

In July 2016, Northeastern University [announced that it would invest $25m of its endowment in clean energy and renewables](https://news.northeastern.edu/2016/07/11/northeastern-to-invest-25-million-of-endowment-funds-in-environmental-sustainability/), boasting that the institution was ""a recognised leader in sustainability practices”.

In April 2017, Northeastern [invited Elizabeth Warren to open its new $225m Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex](https://www.wbur.org/edify/2017/04/03/northeastern-celebrates-grand-opening-of-225-million-science-facility).

However, despite the complex’s ideals and goals, which include seeking solutions to rising sea levels and pollution, Northeastern was one of 12 prominent US universities and colleges named in the Paradise Papers as investors in a hedge fund based in the Cayman Islands. The fund is a feeder to a subsidiary based in Houston, Texas, of EnCap Investments, a company that, since 1988, has pumped almost $20bn into oil and shale gas exploration and production.

Now back to Harvard.

With such a massive endowment, some have claimed that the school [should use more of the fund to entirely eliminate tuition.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/a-push-to-make-harvard-free-also-questions-the-role-of-race-in-admissions.html?referer=&_r=1)

Others have argued that Harvard’s funds could be better used by [recruiting and educating more low-income students, rather than giving free education to their already relatively well-off student body](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-problem-with-making-harvard-free-2016-01-17).

Harvard clapped back.

[In their 2018-2019 financial report](https://finance.harvard.edu/annual-report), they stressed that the endowment does not give the school full financial freedom.

""There is a common misconception that endowments, including Harvard's, can be accessed like bank accounts, used for anything at any time as long as funds are available. In reality, Harvard's flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it is designed to last forever, which is crucial for an institution intended to serve generations of students and pursue research on big questions - questions that cannot be answered in one lifetime.""

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 [axed the tax-exempt status of university endowments, imposing a 1.4 percent tax](https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Treasury-Department-Releases-Endowment-Tax-Draft-Rules.aspx) on realised income of universities whose investment assets top $500,000 per student. The IRS anticipates that about 25 to 40 institutions will fall under this definition.

Stanford are expected to face a $43 million tax bill, and Harvard are expecting a $50 million bill.

What are your thoughts on the endowment situation: are they just asset management firms with schools attached?

t3_gi8zlv,Hedge Fund Billionaire Michael Platt,"In 2015, Michael Platt decided to go it alone and [close his hedge fund BlueCrest Capital Management to clients](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/business/dealbook/bluecrest-capital-to-return-money-to-outside-investors.html).

BlueCrest had been one of the biggest hedge funds in Europe, with $37 billion of assets under management.

However, after a few years of disappointing returns, investors became less enamoured with Platt.

[One issue they focused on was a proprietary BlueCrest fund](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/fund-within-a-fund-creates-a-conflict/) that only managed Platt’s capital and money belonging to other BlueCrest partners and employees.

As well as this, institutional investors were pushing for lower fees.

Hedge funds typically follow a “2 and 20” model: Investors pay an annual management fee of 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of profits.

According to Platt, ""It's much more profitable to have 0 and 100 rather than 2 and 20,""

This refers to the fact that they don't need to share profits with outside investors.

So in 2015 Platt returned the $7 billion BlueCrest managed for outside clients and decided to turn BlueCrest into a private investment partnership and focus on managing his own wealth and that of his partners and employees.

This decision has certainly paid off handsomely for Platt and BlueCrest.

Since 2015 he has more than doubled his net worth - which currently sits at $8 billion.

In 2019, BlueCrest returned 53.5% net after expenses and [Platt made about $2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2020/02/03/hedge-fund-trader-michael-platt-made-2-billion-in-2019-without-any-clients/#77bbaf264035).

With a much smaller asset base, Platt has increased leverage, took on more risk, and enjoyed strong returns.

The majority of BlueCrest’s returns did not come from trading equities, which surged last year, but from significant long fixed income positions early in 2019.

Platt first became involved in the markets through his grandmother.

""She was a long-term investor and did very well at it. She was a very strong woman. She wasn't interested in baking cake for me; she was interested in what stock I wanted to buy or sell.""

Platt states that he has had a very easy life because he never had to think about what he wanted to do:

He wanted to be a trader from the age of 12 and started when he was 13, successfully trading stocks through high school and university with one major exception - the infamous Black Monday Crash of 1987, when his stock account lost half its value in a single day.

Platt has no tolerance for trading losses:

""I hate losing money more than anything. Losing money is what kills you. It is not the actual loss. It's the fact that it messes up your psychology.""

Platt believes in aggressive stop losses and effectively structures his *traders* like they are options

He will cut trader's allocations by half if lose 3% of their capital and remove their capital allocation if they lose more than 6%.

However, he will also lift allocations to winning trades - therefore the downside is limited, but the upside is unlimited.

""We want people to scale down if they are getting it wrong and scale up if they are getting it right. If a guy has a $100 million allocation and makes $20 million, he then has $23 million to his stop point.""

But what does Platt looks for in his traders?

**Someone who has an edge:**

""I look for the type of guy in London who gets up at seven o'clock on Sunday morning when his kids are still in bed, and logs onto a poker site so that he can pick off the U.S. drunks coming home on Saturday night. I hired a guy like that. He usually clears 5 or 10 grand every Sunday morning before breakfast taking out the drunks playing poker because they're not very good at it, but their confidence has gone up a lot.""

**Paranoia:**

""I want guys who when they put on a good trade immediately start thinking about what they could put on against it. They just have the paranoia.""

**The market is always right:**

""Market makers know that the market is always right. They know value is irrelevant in times of market stress; it's all about positions. They understand that markets will trade against positions. They get it.""

**Someone who admits they are wrong:**

""Both the ex-market makers who blew up became way too invested in their positions. Their ego got in the way. They just didn't want to be wrong, and they stayed in their positions.""

Recently, it was reported that [BlueCrest cut at least 10 portfolio managers](https://www.businessinsider.com/citadels-relative-value-losses-last-week-wiped-nearly-all-gains-2020-3?r=US&IR=T) as the firm suffered losses in its fixed-income relative value strategy.

It also cut risk across the firm by about $1 billion.

Relative-value trades involve trying to profit from small differences in the prices of similar assets, such as two different Treasury bonds or a bond versus a future.

To boost profitability, portfolio mangers tend to employ substantial leverage.

Therefore, they rely on the steady availability of financing and a relatively stable relationship between the securities in the portfolio. This means that, when volatility increases sharply, losses can mount very quickly.

While BlueCrest suffered some losses since the sell-off, they are apparently still up for the year.

Over the 15 years that BlueCrest managed client money, they produced more than $22 billion in trading profits for investors.

It's not quite the insane returns of the [GOAT hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies' Medallion fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI), but nonetheless still pretty good.

t3_gk7ruf,A green way to rebuild the economy,"So I was thinking. Now that it's clear to everybody that spending isn't constrained by deficits, we've been able to lend / hand out money to companies / people. That's injecting liquidity into the system, but not always necessarily generating productivity in terms of goods and services.

By now, the consensus view seems to be that there will be irreparable damage to the economy, and that it will be hard to bring it back online the way it was. Which means that, left alone, millions of people will remain unemployed and not spending. Since one man's spending is another one's income, this will slow down recovery. One can address that via unemployment subsidies, which would be costly and generate again little productivity.

But if spending is no longer a constraint, there might be better uses for that new money. The government could stimulate the economy with large infrastructure projects instead, which would generate massive amounts of paid jobs, fuelling again a healthy middle class able to spend and reignite the services sector.

One amazing use for that productivity would be **massive nation-wide renewable energy projects**, which would serve multiple goals:

* Reduce dependency on foreign countries and fossil fuels
* Creating a strong local industry which might even export tech R&D and products
* Reduce unemployment by creating massive amounts of paid jobs, restarting spending
* Significantly slow down climate change
* Redistribute wealth somehow by decentralizing energy supply

The jobs created would have impacts at every level: rural areas with the ability to install solar or wind, the transformation of cities by equipping houses with solar and geothermal systems, new companies to service this economy, etc, etc. It would generate demand for both qualified jobs and general manpower.

This is the kind of spending America did with the highway system and the moon landing, with long lasting benefits to the country.

It feels like this is a perfect moment historically to be starting big audacious projects. This one specifically could be viewed positively by either party.

So, how do we make this happen? I'm thinking of putting a website together exploring all the implications of this kind of plan, so I would appreciate any feedback or criticism. How could something like this work?",4,1.0,1589543898.0

In poor countries it's often the case that people can't get loans to start a business because the interest rates are high and the people don't have money to begin with. A lot of poor countries have educated people that can't find a job because there are not enough businesses to provide them with a job. So they either fly to another country or go into illegal practices like scamming people online.

It seems like a cycle they can never get out of, because they're poor and sometimes in unstable countries, the interest rates stay high, thus it becomes exceedingly hard to start a business. 

I know printing money could trigger hyper inflation if done improperly, but looking at China, their country started government projects with I assume printed money and this way the inflation stays stable, because they're increasing their production with government funded projects, and thus increasing the output of their economy at the same time.

An Amazon team has headed to Texas to talk with J.C. Penney about buying the company, according to Women’s Wear Daily, a news source dedicated to retail industry news.

“There is an Amazon team in Plano as we speak,” the Women’s Wear Daily report said. “There is a dialogue and I’m told it has a lot to do with Amazon eager to expand its apparel business.”

**Why Amazon might be interested in Penney?**

\- Grow its apparel and accessories sales;

\- Turn some of the department store’s properties into distribution facilities; and/or

\- Create “a new tech-driven” store model that would make use of its Just Walk Out cashier-free system.

t3_gopatt,Joe Rogan's $100 Million Spotify Deal,"Joe ""podcast is moving to Spotify"" Rogan made [headlines recently when he announced that he has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/business/media/joe-rogan-spotify-contract.html).

The multi-year deal is reportedly worth more than $100 million.

Within just 48 hours of the announcement, [Spotify's market cap increased by nearly $4 billion](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotifys-market-cap-value-soars-by-nearly-4bn-in-wake-of-landmark-joe-rogan-podcast-deal/), to it's highest point in nearly two years.

At the time of the announcement, Spotify's share price was around $169, with a market cap around $31BN. As of yesterday, their share price hit an all time high of over $195, with a market cap around $36BN.

Clearly, this is a big coup for Spotify, who have nabbed the biggest name in the podcast world and one of the biggest stars on YouTube.

His podcast is the number one podcast in the world and gets as many as 190 million downloads per month. In fact, he was [Forbes highest-paid podcaster of 2019, raking in $30 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/02/03/crime-does-pay-my-favorite-murder-stars-join-joe-rogan-as-highest-earning-podcasters/#177986913773).

Of course, this had led to a discussion about the value of content, specifically the value assigned to music and longer form content like Rogan's podcast.

According to music writer [Ted Gioia, a musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights](https://twitter.com/tedgioia/status/1262930316253110276).

It is important to understand the context here:

**For every dollar in revenue the Spotify earns, it sends 65 cents straight to the record industry.**

**This caps Spotify's earnings potential, and means that it has a less robust business model than Netflix.**

**For example, if Netflix pays, say, $30 million to make a new season of Ozark, that cost doesn't increase if it attracts more eyeballs. Media Rights Capital, which produces the show, makes the same money from Netflix regardless of whether the audience is 5,000 or 5 million.**

**However, that is not the case with Spotify: costs** ***rise*** **with subscribers.**

**Every stream will see another slice of the listener's monthly subscription fee go to the record label.**

Spotify has a gross margin of around 25%, whereas Netflix has a gross margin of around 38%.

Spotify has recently spent more than $600 million acquiring four podcasting firms, [including the $250 million acquisition of Ringer earlier this year.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-11/spotify-said-to-pay-250-million-for-ringer-in-podcasting-drive)

Therefore, for a capped cost, Spotify can attract new listeners and potential subscribers. Also, the more time listeners spend on podcasts, the less money Spotify gives to the record labels.

[The deal has raised comparisons with Howard Stern](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/05/19/the-new-howard-stern-podcast-giant-joe-rogan-inks-exclusive-deal-with-spotify/) and SiriusXM, which has made Stern a fortune.

[In 2019 alone, Stern took home an estimated $93 million.](https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-stern/#5bedd7033dc7)

If video killed the radio star, did Spotify just kill the YouTube star?

Or is this a smart move on Rogan's part?

After all, it is expected that some clips will remain on YouTube for the casual algorithm viewers.

Rogan has previously been [critical of YouTube's demonetisation policy and censorship on the platform](https://reclaimthenet.org/joe-rogan-youtube-demonetization-policies/).

Overall, Rogan is banking a guaranteed $100 million in an [uncertain economic environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU).

Although some have commented that he is sacrificing the scale provided by YouTube, he may well still have his clips channel on YouTube.

As well as this, he is *licensing* his podcast.

Therefore, if it fails, he has pocketed $100 million and can return to other platforms, thus generating more press.

If it succeeds, he has pocketed $100 million and will have more leverage in the next contract negotiations.

Now that's a win-win.

What are your thoughts on the move?

Some trades valued the Chinese company between $105 billion and $110 billion on the secondary markets. It has also traded as high as $140 billion.

This further cements their position as the world's most valuable startup.

In 2018, ByteDance closed a massive $3 billion funding round, [with funding from major investors such as SoftBank and KKR, valuing the company at $75 billion.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/26/bytedance-raises-3bn-funding-become-worlds-biggest-privately/)

However, the recent private transactions in the secondary market indicate that it's value has increased by more than 33% from two years ago.

By the way, a secondary market transaction is when private company stock is sold to another private party.

This is in contrast to primary market transactions, where companies sell directly to investors.

Stock in the secondary market is usually valued at a discount to primary shares because it is less liquid and there are fewer financial details on company performance available to investors.

It was recently announced that TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally and, [in the first quarter of 2020, it generated the most downloads for any app ever in a quarter, with 315 million installs across the App Store and Google Play.](https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-2-billion)

TikTok’s record breaking surge in downloads comes amid the lock-down, as the population looks for it's next dopamine hit.

The $100 billion valuation reflects expectations by investors that ByteDance will keep pulling in advertisers.

**Tiger Global, rumoured to be one of the buyers in the secondary market, estimates that ByteDance will grab 19% of China's online advertising market this year, compared to the 4% of the market it captured in 2017.**

Total digital ad spending in China is expected to reach $81 billion this year.

In the past decade, only two companies have traded at a higher premium than ByteDance in the secondary markets.

According to Andrea Walne, a partner at Manhattan Venture Partners who follows the secondary markets: ""The trading of ByteDance is reflective of the global wave of consumers who agree that ByteDance can displace Facebook as the leading social network.""

In 2019, lawmakers raised concerns about TikTok's growing influence in the United States, and two senior members of Congress asked US intelligence to [determine whether it poses ""national security risks.""](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-tiktok/u-s-senators-call-for-intelligence-probe-into-chinese-owned-app-tiktok-idUSKBN1X32J3)

Mayer's top priority will be to prove to American lawmakers, regulators and consumers that they can trust the Chinese-owned app with their data.

And that is going to be one uphill battle...

t3_gqnbfk,Palladium: The New Silver?,"Being well and truly bored during this Covid-19 lockdown, but not bored enough to take on a real project I find myself indulging in odd bits o useless speculation.  Sometimes something weird pops up and this is one of them.

Silver used to be a precious metal, tracked gold really well until it didn't. It was used for jewelry, tea pots, and photographic film. Then they invented cameras that didn't use film. Silver is now cheap.

Palladium is precious metal, currently worth more than $2,000 an ounce and gold goes for $1,700. About half of the world's palladium production goes to making catalytic converters. Covid-19 just put the world into recession and that means that car sales are going to be way down, and will take may years to recover. So fewer cars sold means fewer catalytic converters needed and that means less demand for palladium. And falling palladium prices.

t3_gt0boz,The Fourth Industrial Revolution,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution represents a fundamental change in the way we live, work and relate to one another.

**Part 1/4 - What is the 4th Industrial Revolution?**

The Fourth Industrial Revolution can be described as the advent of ""cyber-physical systems"" involving entirely new capabilities for people and machines.

These capabilities are reliant on the technologies and infrastructure of the Third Industrial Revolution, but the Fourth Industrial Revolution represents entirely new ways in which technology becomes embedded within societies and even our human bodies.

A few examples include robotics, genome editing, 3D printing, new forms of machine intelligence, biotechnology, and approaches to governance that rely on cryptographic methods such as the blockchain.

As the novelist William Gibson famously said: ""The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.""

In many parts of the world, some aspects of the Second and Third Industrial Revolutions have yet to be experienced, due to the fact that new technologies are in some cases able to ""leapfrog"" older ones.

[As the United Nations pointed out in 2013](https://news.un.org/en/story/2013/03/435102-deputy-un-chief-calls-urgent-action-tackle-global-sanitation-crisis#.VpzAAfkrLIX), more people in the world have access to a mobile phone than basic sanitation.

In the same way, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is beginning to emerge at the same time that the third, digital revolution is spreading and maturing across countries and organisations.

As a result, there are a few key themes to consider when thinking about the consequences of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution will dramatically reshape economies, with enormous change predicted in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape.

&#x200B;

**Part 2/4 - Inequality:**

One of the primary issues this is likely to exacerbate is inequality.

For some context, the world's richest 1% have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people.

The wider trend of [Technological Deflation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE) does not sit well with Central Banks who are desperate to sustain 'growth' at all costs. 

Via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), money printing itself increases inequality due to asset price inflation.

[The recent splurge of fiat](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-fed-balancesheet/fed-balance-sheet-increases-to-record-6-13-trillion-idUSKCN21R3FR) indicates that inequality is heading in only one direction...

Moreover, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will lead to an upward bias of skill requirements, which disproportionally affects older and lower-income cohorts.

More than 50% of the world's population is now online, and roughly one million more people join the Internet each day.

Precision medicine, autonomous vehicles and drones are all fast-growing markets, while AI alone is expected to boost global growth by around 14% by 2030.

[A Report in 2017 by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages) looked at the impact of automation on the workforce.

***In the United States, a rapid automation scenario would result in the displacement of 73 million jobs, and up to 33% of the 2030 workforce may need to switch occupational groups.***

***The report concludes that by 2030, 3-14% of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories, and that all workers will need to adapt to increasingly capable machines. Some of that adaption will require higher educational attainment, or spending more time on activities that require social and emotional skills, creativity, high-level cognitive capabilities and other skills relatively hard to automate.***

&#x200B;

**Part 3/4 - Security:**

The digital nature of 4th Industrial Revolution technologies makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks that can take a multitude of forms, from data theft ransomware to the overtaking of systems with potentially harmful large-scale consequences.

Organised cybercrime groups are joining forces with their likelihood of detection and prosecution pretty low - [it is estimated that only 3 in 1000 cyber incidents see an arrest](https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors).

As well as this, the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution also offer expanded capabilities for waging war, which are increasingly accessible to both state and non-state actors.

On the frontier of emerging military technologies are those that [interact directly with the human brain to augment or even control soldiers](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-wants-soldiers-to-control-machines-with-their-minds-2019-12?r=US&IR=T).

Even these are not limited to government military programmes.

According to James Giordano of Georgetown University Medical Center: ""It's not a question of if non state actors will use some form of neuroscientific techniques or technologies, but when, and which ones they'll use.""

The brain...is the next battle space

&#x200B;

**Part 4/4 - Community:**

The final piece to this discussion is the impact that this will have on individuals and communities.

Digital media is increasingly becoming the primary driver of our individual and collective framing of society and community, connecting more people than ever before but also *isolating* individuals in a maze of dopamine and polarizing propaganda.

Controversial or anti-establishment views can be further undermined by states and other actors willing to use new technologies and platforms to restrict speech.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the first where the tools of technology can become literally embedded within us and even purposefully change who we are at the level of our genetic makeup. 

It is completely conceivable that forms of radical human improvement will be available within a generation, innovations that risk creating entirely new forms of inequality and class conflict.

These emerging technologies will change what it means...to be human.

t3_gsip5u,How exactly do big retail chains pay their individual suppliers ?,"This may be a bit of an oddly articulated question, but please hear me out.

I am talking strictly about the daily needed basic goods here, nothing fancy.

For simplicity's sake lets broadly split it in 3 categories:

1)

Foods & Beverages

2)

Personal Hygiene

3)

Household products / Cleaning / Laundry etc.

Please note that I am not from the US (I'm from Germany) so I cannot name too many US retail chains (I know about Waltmart, Target and Krogers from my vacation in the US). I could name many german chains, but I suppose that wouldn't do any good here. 

But you DO have Lidl in the US, right ? It's one of the biggest discounter chains here in germany (cheap prices, streamlined range of products).

Of course I do know that everything that gets sold in retail first needs to be bought by the retailer, mostly through contractually fixated contingents, based on what product it is and how much of that is usually sold and needed in the area the store is in.

But how exactly do the mechanics work here ? 

Because there are literally thousands of manufacturers, and there are a multitude of steps in the supply chains, especially when it comes to foods and drinks. 

For example, there are foods who are heavily processed already in a factory (like ready meals, mixture bags for cooking specific meals etc.)  which is a highly industrialized process, which can be done by the big major companies themselves (Nestle, Kraft etc.), but there also things like fresh meat and fish, cutlery, cheese, eggs, milk, bread, pasta, rice, fruit, vegetables, beer, wine, spirits, you name it ...

Some is seeded and harvested by farmers, some animals are bred for slaughter by farmers, chickens and cows must be kept and maintained for eggs and milk, bread is baked by bakers, beer brewed in brewery's, wine from winery's, mineral springs for bottled waters and so on and so forth ...

I simply cannot imagine that all big retail chains would have supply contracts directly with the producers / farmers. Because if they had, how many freaking contracts would they have to make ? 

And these are almost always very small familiy businesses. And there are tens of thousands of them throughout the US (or most other nations, for that matter).

There are big industrialized bakery's, slaughterhouses, beverage filling plants and brewery's etc., of course.

But some things can hardly be ever fully industrialized beause they have to ORIGIN somewhere. As I said : Seeds must be sown, crops be harvested, pigs and chickens be bred. 

And the meat industry with their big meat-processing plants  turns the live stock into what we buy and consume, but they sure as hell didn't breed that pig themselves, you know what I mean ? 

It's a little simpler with hygiene products and detergents, cleaners and household items, I guess.

In Germany for example the market for these items is very consolidated. Whenever you buy any cleaner, detergent or hygiene product there is a very good chance that it's a brand of one of 6 companys.

Henkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Colgate Palmolive and SC Johnson. Those 6 basically share 90% of the market in these categories, so I suppose it is rather easy for retailers to make direct contracts with them. Plus, these things are made in industrail / chemical plants, most of it is artificial and no small time farmers are involved with the production of these items.

But with food and drinks ... I just don't understand.

Big retailers sell all these products all day, every day. They're all in the store, they're all paid for at checkout, every customer takes specifically what they need and want. Everything gets digitally accounted for I suppose, but HOW does the retailer know how much they have to pay any individual supplier ? How much does Unilever get ? How much the meat-processing plant from New Jersey ? And how much does bloody Harold Jenkins, the self-employed crop farmer from Idaho and his family get ? 

How can they possibly know how much of his valued labour is in the fucking loaf of bread they just sold for 79 ct ? How can this ever be fairly calculated ? Who pays Harold anyway ? Who is he selling to ? 

Are the suppliers / manufacturers paid strictly upfront upon order / delivery and strictly by allocated contingent ? Are they paid estimated lump sums ? And WHO is paid anyway ? Any manufacturer individually ? Or does it all get collected with wholesale marketers who have bigger negotiating power ? And if so, wouldn't that severely fuck over the small farmers and family businesses ?

And then, of course, there are also those goods who are branded by the chains themselves, but as I understand it, these are often the same products as their original counterparts (often even produced in the very same factory) just repacked and relabeled, as a way to justify a discounted price. The manufacturers basically sell their excess at a calculated loss here, as a means to be able to run their plants and factories at max capacity at all times.

And how do wholsale marketers factor into all this in general ? I know they deliver their stock at a win margin to gas stations and restaurants and business owners can go shop there directly. But do retail chains also get at least part of their stock from wholesales ? If so, that would be one more (rather redundant ?) link in the supply chain, no ? 

It is more clear with bigger things like cars, furniture and electronics (both household and entertainment), because there simply aren't THAT many manufacturers and links in the supply chain. For example, Sony builds a certain line of LED-TV's in one of their plants and sells a certain contingent to any electronic retailer (or Amazon), who then sell it to the end-customer at a win margin, including VAT.

But how it works for retailers of daily necessities with their thousands upon thousands suppliers ... I'm just at a loss.

Can anyone help me out there ?",2,1.0,1590713308.0

t3_gu7ajq,Here is Phase 4 - Another Stimulus Bill Has Reached the Senate - Will it help you or your business?," At a cost of $3 trillion, the HEROES Act would supplant the CARES Act as the most expensive piece of relief legislation in history. While not encompassing, here's some of what HEROES Act would do:

* Approximately $1 trillion would be set aside to cover pay for first-line workers and teachers.
* Some $200 billion would be allocated for the creation of a Heroes' Fund, which would provide hazard pay to essential workers.
* Unemployment benefit protections would be extended from the end of July through January 2021.
* An additional $75 billion would be apportioned for COVID-19 supplies and contact tracing measures.
* An estimated $175 billion would go to families to help pay their rent, mortgage, and utility payments.
* An extension of the employee retention tax credit, allowing employers to more easily keep staff on the payroll.
* And... a second round of direct stimulus would be headed Americans' way.

What would you receive if the HEROES Act were signed into law, as-is? Similar to the CARES Act, the maximum payout is $1,200 per individual and $2,400 per couple, with the qualifying AGI thresholds exactly the same as the CARES Act.

What differs is that dependents (limit three) can add $1,200 each to what a parent or household receives, rather than just $500 per qualifying dependent. Furthermore, all dependents can qualify to bolster the payout of what a parent or household receives, not just those under the age of 17. With a limit of three qualifying dependents per household, a married couple could rake in as much as $6,000 under the HEROES Act.

One additional change that's worth noting is that noncitizens would be able to receive payments under the HEROES Act, which is in direct contrast to the CARES Act. As long as a noncitizen has a taxpayer identification number, that person could qualify for a payment.",4,0.83,1590960184.0

t3_guozw0,Thoughts/discussion on the effect of WFH on long term housing market,"I’ve been looking for articles regarding this and don’t really seem to find any discussion or thoughts online, so thought I would start a discussion here - apologies if this is the wrong sub.

I have been watching the housing market for a while and as many other young adults, waiting for the right opportunity to get a step on to the ladder meanwhile trying to save up as much as possible. Since covid emerged I have seen a drop in prices and mostly Airbnb apartments come on to the market and seeing prices reduce but not significantly.

I’m beginning to think covid/job losses/reduced income right now isn’t what’s going to crash the market but in fact more companies embracing work from home - I’ve been working from home since mid March, and was informed that we are not expected to return to the offices till Dec/Jan at the earliest and it will be a phased return,continuing to work from home as much as possible. This just makes me think well, why am I paying such high prices to live in downtown, to be 20 minutes walking distance from the office when the office has now shifted to my bedroom? 

Companies such as Shopify have already confirmed they are moving to a permanent WFH model and I believe the longer quarantine continues more companies will realise wfh works, the cost saving in office space and other benefits. This will make people probably like me wonder why we pay a lot in either rent or mortgage to live here when we could be anywhere else enjoying nature/scenic views/by the sea etc 

Ofcourse, not to say everyone can afford the benefit to work from home and some may not want to but the more jobs become remote I feel downtown/city centre prices will reduce drastically as more people choose to live further out in bigger and nicer spaces. Would also be interesting to see the effects on the local economies that serve downtown areas such as hospitality retail etc

The only arguments seem to be something along the lines of it has always bounced back, so it will again.  
Or something along the lines of it's too big to fail.  I can't really accept that.

The case for collapse if pretty strong.  Massive money printing (QE), crazy amounts of corporate debt, and COVID-19 on top of that.  I didn't need to reiterate all the arguments here, they are everywhere.  I'm looking for a strong counterpoint, it there is one.

Now when we talk about collapse it doesn't mean the economy will cease to exist.  We should define that.  It pretty much means that access to debt will disappear, the results of which will be many corporations going bankrupt and many people losing their jobs, etc.  

Of course, the economy won't collapse forever and something will replace it so maybe we should call it more of an economic regime change.  I fully expect that the currencies that we now use will be printed to oblivion and be replaced by a series of government-backed crypto-currencies.  This is speculation of course but China is already heading that way.  That's just an example of regime change, there are other possibilities.

t3_gx02k0,The Truth about Warren Buffett?,"The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?

Is there something that is often overlooked?

Or is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)

Anyway...Let's begin...

&#x200B;

The story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. 

This is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.

He won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.

Before this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.

He was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha, Buffett-Falk & Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.

But what about Warren Buffett?

In 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. 

In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.

His starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.

However, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.

He went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. 

These were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.

For example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000 (in the 50′s).

&#x200B;

In 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.  

The law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.

Remember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.

***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***

Remember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. 

After all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.

&#x200B;

Imagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:

1). Get insider information to trade on it;

2). Get a six-figure position after College;

3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;

4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;

5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;

6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;

7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you ain't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;

8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives ""financial weapons of mass destruction"" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).

&#x200B;

What about Buffett's status as the GOAT?

[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.

Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.

&#x200B;

Buffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years.

Berkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.

Also, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as ""rat poison squared""

Ultimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.

Moreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?

Bitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.

&#x200B;

It's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:

***""I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it, unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.""***

His son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.

**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**

**First Deals = Insider Information**

**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**

What are your thoughts?

Is it true... or false?

The objective is to design a city for 1 million inhabitants on Mars. The entire project started after The Mars Society launched the [Mars City State Design Competition](https://www.marssociety.org/news/2020/02/11/mars-city-state-design-competition-announced/). Since then, numerous volunteers at [r/NexusAurora](https://www.reddit.com/r/NexusAurora/) have been working hard on the challenge. The first draft is out and we are hoping to get some constructive criticism. The entire authoring process is done via Discord & Google Drive. These are several issues that we want to address.

**Too Lightweight** \- The information density on this report should be increased 2x by shrinking font size, line height and paddings and adopting a 2 column layout for easy reading in this setup. (Scientific papers have this tendency)

**It Lacks Insights** \- What I am reading sounds right now like somebody who spent a lot of time on the forums and cherry-picked the prettiest solutions. There is no deep explanation arguing why we chose tech X instead of the alternatives.

**PROs and CONs** \- There are none right now. Before advancing a solution please also acknowledge it's weaknesses. That indicates that you truly master the topic and that you are aware of it's potential pitfalls.

**Falls Short On Economics & Life Balance** \- Yesterday's meeting concluded that Marsorbust and Felix (Administration Lead) will ask each team to provide more insights over the economics and human well being.

It's honestly a darn shame that in order to survive in this country, one is required to invest themselves in the stock market, which originally was intended to help prosper new businesses. Now it's being used as a monetary water hole. 

Greed has gotten the better of capitalism, gents. And the government is just there trying to do what's right, without truly understand the consequences. In the end, it only will increase the class gap: the haves (who understand the system), and the have nots (who are honest working Americans, just trying to get by on their minimum wage job, but do not understand the system).

Congratulations everybody! You've all killed the American dream. Because anybody who stands by and allows it happen, is apart of it. And no, I'm not saying you have to go march on Wall Street, but simply admitting to it is good enough in my eyes. Because it gets the word around. And we all know it. Just don't turn your heads, because that's what the German's did in the 1940s.

[https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/retail-sales-annual](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/retail-sales-annual)

Current   S&P500 PE ratio is 22.40. If history does repeat itself, end of   recessions don't happen until that number comes down to around 10. I   think stock market is ridiculously expensive right now. I lived through   the past 2 recessions. I remember back then there was a lot of hysteria   in the market right before the crash started and I've been seeing a  lot  of that now. Newbie investors are buying up stocks like Hertz,  which has  already declared bankruptcy. If there was a local restaurant  doing very  bad and declared bankruptcy, would you invest in it?

According   to Bridgewater Associate's analysis on the impact of COVID-19 on the   economy, when unemployment rate is at 10%, airline industries will take a   85% drop in earnings. American Airlines Stock is at 17 today. If you  do  the math and factor in the potential earnings drop, the stock should  be  at 5. Warren Buffett thought AAL was expensive even at 11 and he is  right. He probably knows a lot more about companies than most of us.

Also,  a lot of newbie  investors keep saying ""don't fight the fed."" They will  keep the printer  going. All you need to look at is the Nikkei chart  starting from the  80's. Japan kept printing massive amounts of money in  the 90's, which  resulted in the economy going through a depression for  the next 20  years.

I know there are a lot of new investors out there. I would be very, very cautious about buying any stocks right now.

Let's start with Robinhood.

And no, [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgYd5Hm7Eb0) the legendary outlaw who robbed the rich to give to the poor.

Robinhood made around $100 million from selling its customer order flow in the first quarter of this year.

This means that Robinhood is selling retail order flow to hedge funds, who can then use high frequency trading algorithms to front run the trades.

Citadel, a hedge fund which manages a cool $32 billion, paid Robinhood almost $50 million in Q1 2020 just for its order flow.

Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya [described the practice as ""shady AF""](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1272194994057515011).

***So basically, Citadel takes free money via the New York Fed's overnight Repos, places huge leverage bets (which may or may not blow up - who cares anyway!), but gets to buy order flow from Robinhood to front run retail, then the US Treasury issues checks to retail, who buy stocks via Robinhood, and the circle of 'capitalism' is complete.***

This is why Ken Griffin can buy $238 million condos. Citadel know who is leveraged, they know where all the stops are and they trade against everybody. And of course the SEC is bought and paid for.

**Part 2/3 - Shoeshine Time:**

After making good money owning stocks in the roaring bull market of the 1920s, Joseph Kennedy Sr. found himself needing to get his shoes polished.

While sitting in the chair, Kennedy Sr. was shocked to have the shoeshine boy gift him with several tips on which stocks he should own.

Kennedy Sr. quickly went back to his office and started unloading his stock portfolio.

***In fact, he didn't just get out of the market - he aggressively shorted it - and got filthy rich during the epic crash that followed.***

Fast forward to today, and we have the Buy High Sell Low Kings, CNBC's Fast Money, talking about the Rise of the Day Trader. 

We have a record number of Wall Street professionals saying the S&P is overvalued.

We have Jerome trying his best to keep the market propped up.

We have Hertz pumping nearly 1000% after filing for bankruptcy.

We are clearly at the death throes of the market cycle.

**Part 3/3 - Hedge Funds:**

Let me tell you the [fascinating story of Ke Xu](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-11-19/the-triple-jeopardy-of-ke-xu-a-chinese-hedge-fund-quant), a Chinese quant.

Xu studied maths at Cambridge, by the way one of the most competitive courses in the world, and graduated third in a class of 250.

He then worked at Goldman Sachs, got bored and in 2012 joined the relatively secretive quant hedge fund G-Research.

He spent his days writing code in G-Research's ""secure zone"", which could be entered only through a special pod with a biometric finger scanner and a weight sensor designed to detect unauthorised equipment entering or leaving the area.

Xu's first bonus at G Research, awarded only a few months after joining, shattered any illusions that he had joined the hedge fund elite.

He wrote in an online message to his girlfriend, who was working as a corporate lawyer in Hong Kong:

""Bonus only 3k, Fuck me, why? Only December, but it is still crap, crap crap, crap. It should be more.""

So Xu stepped his game up - he came up with 20 trading strategies - ""signals"" in quantspeak - and tested each in numerous simulations.

Seven proved profitable enough to adopted by fund and put to work in real markets.

So at the start of 2014, Xu was feeling confident about his second-year bonus.

""If I get 1.1 million this year, next year should be 3.3 million. Next year it will be 16 million, then 100 million.""

Instead, he was awarded a bonus of £400K and, although this was a huge amount for a young man from provincial China, it was far less than he was expecting - so he began planning his exit.

It was around this time that Xu began covertly accessing his colleagues' signals.

After all, he would have a better chance of getting a good job elsewhere if he had ready-to-use signals to offer potential employers.

He landed two offers in Asia, but told his managers at G-Research nothing about his plans. 

One evening, Xu cleared out his desk and placed a resignation letter on his manager's desk, and boarded a flight to Hong Kong. 

The abruptness of Xu's departure raised immediate suspicions.

The next morning security personnel at G-Research reviewed video footage of his activities the night before, leading the company's attorneys to get an emergency court order.

***To cut a long story short, G-Research then got the prestigious law firm Allen & Overy on the case, got a travel ban against Xu, who was reported to police in London, then arrested in Hong Kong in August 2014, extradited to the UK in December 2014, then sentenced in July 2015 to four years in prison.***

But that's not all: G-Research then used an ancient quirk of the British legal system called a private prosecution to find out who's seen the 55 stolen signals.

This allows the purported victim of a crime, if they are rich of course, to prosecute the perpetrator if the state fails to do so.

Although G-Research were paying their bills, the lawyers spoke to the jury per the norms of private prosecutions, as representatives of the Crown - the British Government.

In January 2017, jurors founds Xu guilty of two of the five charged in the private prosecution, and the judge sentenced him to an additional 18 months.

If you think FED will let gold price to continue to go up, you're either not thinking pr do not understand the relationship between gold and the almighty greenback.

Now that FED has been printing money like there is no tomorrow, folks and countries alike have been selling dollar and buying up gold like there is no tomorrow -- they all believe the greenback will devalue like shit.

China in particular, dumping treasuries, stocking up gold, and coming out with Crypto Yuan. Russian has been doing that for a while, and many more are doing exactly the same. The US empire will cease to exist if the trend continues becoz there is literally nothing worthy in the United states except using the reserve dollar to live off the rest of the world, tl;dr-ly speaking.

# The War On Gold Has Begun

The war on gold has already started. And yet nobody, no media, no government, nor the companies are actually talking about it. 

To understand the blueprint of what is going on geopolitically and the coming war on gold, all you have to do is focus on the **US Dollar SWAP lines****.** 

What happens next could be the difference between you making the **biggest gains** you’ve ever seen in your life…

Or watching your **gold investments go to zero** during this unprecedented time in the world.

I urge you **not to buy another gold stock** until you understand what’s really going on behind the scenes… and how you can profit from it.

t3_hgaohe,The Truth about the Great Depression?,"The roaring '20s was a period of economic growth, jazz and carefree living for many.

A decade of change, when many Americans owned cars, radios, and telephones for the first time.

Prosperity was on the rise in cities and towns, and social change flavoured the air.

The attitude was, as is currently the case, stocks only go up.

Of course, all good things come to an end...

&#x200B;

**What happened in the Great Depression?**

The Fed is supposed to keep inflation and monetary policy stable.

However, in the 1920s, they created huge quantities of money and cheap credit, which drove rapid expansion and a bubble.

This bubble popped in October 1929, and the Fed then adopted tight monetary policy throughout the early 1930s, creating a crash.

&#x200B;

**What** ***really*** **happened in the Great Depression?**

Some go as far to say that the Great Depression was a Government confiscation of wealth.

Here's why...

In 1900, the Gold Standard Act was passed.

This Act fixed the price of gold at $20.67/oz., where it remained until the Great Depression.

In 1933, a month after taking office, FDR signed Executive Order 6102, dubbed the Great Gold Confiscation.

FDR's Executive Order forced all Americans to turn in all their gold coins, bullion and certificates to the Federal Reserve, redeeming them at $20.67/oz in exchange for paper currency.

Historians have speculated that the real reason for the gold confiscation was a bailout of the Federal Reserve Bank.

[Even FDR commented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNxMD2kaF2A) during one of his early ""Fireside Chats"" that gold obligations far exceeded the gold held by the US Treasury and Federal Reserve.

**“Behind government currency we have, in addition to the promise to pay, a reserve of gold and a small reserve of silver,** ***neither of them anything like the total amount of the currency***.” – FDR, 07 May 1933.

After the public had turned in the majority of the gold, FDR artificially increased the price of gold to $35/oz., which, amazingly, instantly bolstered the Federal Reserve holdings.

Starting in 1934, the Federal Reserve even updated the clause printed on currency bills ""redeemable for gold"" with ""redeemable in lawful money.""

This innocuous act foreshadowed the abandonment of the direct exchange of the dollar to gold.

It's also worth noting that it was the Fed's tight monetary policy which converted a recession into a Great Depression.

Others say that it is just the boom/bust cycle:

A boom to make the sheeple produce, create, establish - then a bust to steal it from them at pennies on the dollar.

Rinse...and repeat.

An intentional failure in order to create a crisis and pass laws to empower the government, which funnels wealth and property into the hands of the elite.

***I personally think this is a ridiculous line of reasoning, to say that the Fed intentionally caused the Great Depression. I mean come on, as if an independent agency set up by a cabal of private bankers on a private island and passed when most of the Congress were away for Christmas in 1913 would collude in this way...***

Of course they aren't *that* power hungry!

It's often worthwhile to look at the official story to at least rule out one possibility as to what *actually* happened.

**“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.” - Bill Casey CIA Director**

>III.C. The Warehouse-Lending Process shows the two stages of the warehouse-lending process. In the initial stage, shown on the left side, the mortgage borrower is approved for a mortgage from the nonbank originator, who funds the mortgage using a draw from a line of credit provided by a warehouse lender. Typically, the warehouse lender will only fund about 95 percent of the mortgage balance, so that the nonbank originator has some skin in the game for each loan. The collateral on the loan is the mortgage, and the nonbank in turn transfers the mortgage to the warehouse lender to collateralize the draw on its line of credit. **Since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, mortgage-collateralized warehouse lending has been eligible for accounting and legal treatment as repurchase agreements (repos).**

Next, turn to page 16: **III.D. Vulnerabilities of Warehouse Funding,** to keep it simple its the equavlant to adding stop loss to every warehouse line of credit (which are used to fund mortgages). Since the margin call is on the loan for the mortgage instead of the mortgage itself, we don't see forclosures yet, but instead the margin call money is funded by the repo. Shawdow banks take the margin call. They pay the call via repo loan and pay that back via bonds, hence why the fed is buying those, junk bonds to be specific

>Ginnie Mae servicers can only obtain unsecured financing, such as **unsecured corporate bonds**, to cover their advances. The rates on this financing are high, especially because many nonbanks have highyield credit ratings.

**tl;dr** most high risk mortgages(over 50% of total mortgages) that a bank wouldn't lend, was lent by shadow banks via a link of credit from the banks. Banks have tight stop losses set on these and have been issuing margin calls on tons of them.",32,0.94,1593185940.0

People should be worth the same and derive their value from Earth's value.
  
The total of current money and ""debt"" floating around and stupidly being hoarded by an extreme minority, its worth nothing compared to Earth's value.

 Late society has exponentially plundered from it's value and feeding it to an abstract entity, gravely damaging our own  ecosphere and climate system in the process.
 What is the purpose of a society?
The purpose we give it, derived from the challanges it has. The purpose is restoring and protecting the ecosphere and warranting proper life for everyone and the next generation, for the challange is the hostile environment the collective damage done has produced. A chance to fix our mistake.
 A possible far goal is to achieve climate control and became protectors of biodiversity, pay the debt to Earth and make it more valuable with our actions. We owe it to the planet and ourselves. 
 
 This is where the value of Earth comes in, to know the extent of our debt, now debt it's not an inherently bad thing, is a feature of a working economy. An Economy is a tool for it's society, it should work accordingly, and in our case it is intertwined with our goal.
 We would still have a way to trade our work and objects, pay for services, give presents, invest. Every human would initially have a value, part of the total value of Earth, divided by the number of humans.
 The purpose of a Government is to move towards the goals, administering the tasks required for it to function and move towards society's goal, every decision should be make to start reversing the course of the damage, this is the way to pay what we borrowed from Earth, policy will become a global issue with equal participation, and by adopting the purpose it would better our immediate conditions. It's a win win for everyone involved. Even if we don't achieve the goal, the steps needed to get there will start bettering our society and personal life. 

  I have been thinking about the specifics of the value of one life and global society using a currency of the average of one day of life, linked to the Earths value called a Terra, Earthconomics currency, a universal crypto currency. People trade with each other in percentage of Terras, every human is borned with the same number of Terras. The value of one Life. The maximum Terras one human can be worth is 1.e of one Life.

t3_hhpwfh,Property Tax Should Be Progressive; Here's How!,"Tax progressivity is based on the assumption that the urgency of spending needs declines as the level of spending increases (economists call this the declining marginal utility of consumption), so that wealthy people can afford to pay a higher fraction of their resources in taxes.

Property taxes are computed by applying a flat rate (a certain percentage which varies place by place) to the currently assessed valuation of each parcel of real estate.   But a fairer, more progressive allocation of property taxes is possible and can be efficiently implemented.    
   
To better implement property taxation, a multiplier should be used which takes into account two factors: the land area and the finished square footage of living space.   The multiplier is the average of two percentile values: the land area percentile and the finished square footage percentile.   

Example: Suppose that a McMansion is built with 9,000 square feet of finished living space on 6,000 square feet of land.  We'll assume here that this is in the 99th percentile of finished living space (because 99% of properties have less than 9,000 square feet of finished living space), and in the 59th percentile of land area (because only 59% of properties have less than 6,000 square feet of land).   Averaging these percentiles together, this property's multiplier would be 79%, so this property would be taxed at a high rate.     

Here are 3 examples of Tax calculations:     
     
Tax = (Valuation - Exemptions) * (Basic tax rate) * (Multiplier * 2)    
   
*****     
    
Assume the value of the McMansion to be $500,000 and a standard exemption of $20,000, that the Basic Tax Rate is $25 per $1,000 of home value, and that the property does not qualify for any of the existing exemptions (blind, deaf, veteran, elderly, etc.).  Then   
      
Multiplier = 79% (as calculated above)    
   
Tax = (($500,000 - $20,000)/$1,000) * ($25) * (0.79 * 2)    
   
Tax = $480 * $25 * 1.58 = 480 * $39.5 = $18,960 per year, or 3.792% of the total property value     
     
*The wealthy person would pay $12,500 today; progressive taxation makes the wealthy person pay more.*    
   
*****     
    
For a middle-class person, assume $200,000 and a multiplier of 0.5.  Then   
   
Tax = (($200,000 - $20,000)/$1,000) * ($25) * (0.5 * 2)    
  
Tax = 180 * $25 * 1 = $4,500 per year, or 2.25% of the total property value    

*The middle-class person would pay $5,000 today; progressive taxation gives this person a $500 tax break.*    
   
*****     
    
For a poor person, assume $100,000 and a multiplier of 0.3.  Then    
    
Tax = (($100,000 - $20,000)/$1,000) * ($25) * (0.3 * 2)    
    
Tax = 80 * $25 * 0.6 = $1,200 per year, or 1.2% of the total property value

t3_hjusif,"SEBI Ordered Brokers, Give ‘Best Price’ to Clients for Trade","For years, many retail investors and traders had missed the opportunity to trade on the best prices available due to the pre-programmed trading software of stockbrokers which worked in stock exchange order rather than giving best available prices available on other exchange to execute trades. Regarding this, the market regulator SEBI had already issued guidelines earlier, but the several brokers never paid any attention to them as no ‘no compliance’ action was initiated against them.

Now, the market regular once again asked the brokers to execute the trades at the best available price and mentioned it as the right of trading clients. It means if a stock is available at Rs. 100 on a particular exchange and Rs. 90 at another exchange at the given time, the broker will have to buy it at the best available price irrespective of exchange.

t3_hqq0ip,Law school loan forgiveness bubble?,"TL;DR: It seems that employment for new attorneys (both in the public and private sector) will be impacted by an economic downturn. A recession may also limit students ability to qualify for federal and school-based loan forgiveness programs, and may put constraints on law schools' budgets. Are current law school loan forgiveness programs more unstable than people think? And more broadly, is it likely that these loans themselves are risker than the government estimates?

Hi all,

I am about to take out some loans for law school. This is the first time I've ever made this type of long-term financial decision and investment. An interesting question arose as I have been jumping through all of the loops for paying tuition.

Does anyone have a sense of the overall risk in the law school student loan market, and specifically the long term viability for the existing loan-forgiveness programs? My sense is that loans for higher education are almost always seen as a ""good bet/investment,"" although I'm not sure if given the current climate this is still true. I should preface this by saying that I do not have an econ background, so please forgive me if any of these reflections seem naive or misguided. 

Just to provide some background, the federal government currently allows easy access to loans for incoming law students. On average, across the country there are currently around 30,000 students graduating with 150,000 in debt per year ([https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-law-school-debt/](https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-law-school-debt/)). If those students go on after graduation to work in the public sector or meet certain income maximums, their loans are forgiven after 10 years. Many top schools also have their own loan forgiveness programs that work in tandem with the government's forgiveness program, where if similar criteria are met in terms of employment (public sector employment, and an income max), the students are not required to pay any interest after graduation. An additional (and important) requirement for both federal programs and schools is that students need to be employed in a job that is ""JD required"" - i.e. loans and interest will not be forgiven if you have low income and are working as a barista (I have nothing but love for all of the coffee mavens out there, and this is an unfortunate reality imposed by these lending and educational institutions). 

Again, my knowledge of econ is very limited, but there are a few issues that I noticed while filling out my loan applications:

1. There are minimal credit checks for taking out these loans. Students' income and ability to pay back the loans also varies significantly based on the quality of the school they go to, which is not taken into account when the loans are approved. 
2. Employment opportunities will likely change substantially based on an economic downturn from COVID. This article discusses financial instability in law school loan forgiveness after the 2007/08 recession ([https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the\_law\_school\_bubble\_how\_long\_will\_it\_last\_if\_law\_grads\_cant\_pay\_bills](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_law_school_bubble_how_long_will_it_last_if_law_grads_cant_pay_bills)). Given COVID, the impact on non-profit jobs will mostly likely be most strongly felt in 1.5-2 years, after current  grants to non-profit organizations expire and are not renewed. Right now most state, federal, and private grants to non-profits are ""locked-in"" through 2021, but after that, non-profits expect they will see cuts to their budget as grant money dries up (from lack of taxes for gov't grants, and lack of funds for private grants that depend on the market). This could limit students ability to qualify for loan repayment assistance through the type of employment, since most non-profits will not be hiring. Insofar as lawyering jobs at private are already competitive, and have already been limited by the COVID downturn, there will be restricted employment opportunities in these high income areas too. This restrains 1) graduates' ability to earn enough income to pay back their loans 2) their ability to be employed in a ""JD required"" non-profit lawyering position, since more students will not be able to qualify for the loan forgiveness programs if they have to get jobs outside the legal field.
3. The COVID downturn may also place strain on law schools' budgets, since application rates (and the resulting tuition) may decline. Even if admissions is still robust, schools may have less financial aid to offer, requiring more students to take out loans. This is perhaps the least easy aspect to predict. This article discusses how admissions initially rose during the 2007/08 recession before beginning a multi-year contraction ([https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/law-school-applications-are-down-will-covid-19-spur-a-late-comeback/?slreturn=20200613183326](https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/law-school-applications-are-down-will-covid-19-spur-a-late-comeback/?slreturn=20200613183326)).
4. There are multiple ""feedback loops"" between the federal government, loan servicers, and law schools. I've read that in financial networks these kinds of feedback loops can be a marker of overall instability, although truthfully I don't have any real understanding of why this is the case, or what level of complexity would signify risk ([https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-covid-19-coronavirus-violence-outbreaks-principles](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-covid-19-coronavirus-violence-outbreaks-principles))

Anyone have any thoughts about this? Please feel free to provide any and all corrections on these points, additional links, or just some general reflections. Outside of its personal impact on me as an incoming student, it's sort of interesting to understand how all of these loan granting institutions spread their fingers through the economy.

This quote is taken from the link in the second point above, from the American Bar Association: ""The federal government’s gamble that higher education will continue to result in higher personal incomes eerily echoes Wall Street’s risky assumption that historical patterns in real estate values would carry forward forever and enable many sliced-and-diced mortgage-backed securities to attain AAA ratings.""",2,1.0,1594681718.0

The Coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the countries that did not execute an aggressive and coordinated response. For the first time ever, the United States is one of those countries.

One major reason why the US has, by far, the most cases and deaths of any country is the clear lack of leadership at the national level. However, the pandemic has exposed many other systemic weaknesses in our country. The American political and economic structures that allowed us to be the world leader for the last century, appear to be working against us with this new killer disease.

To some extent, we have been the victims of our own success. The strength of business in the US allowed us to achieve a dominant economic position after World War II. This prosperity fueled an incredibly strong middle class along with enormous innovation and technological advancement.

Over the decades, companies have been pushing for continuous growth at aggressive rates to keep their investors satisfied. Corporations have evolved techniques to maximize revenues and minimize costs. After all this time, that approach has created enormous inequality and stress on our society. Those weaknesses have been exploited by this pandemic, which has left tens of millions of Americans exposed.

With this vicious pandemic, we were forced to essentially pause our economy. Millions of jobs have been lost and people have suffered greatly – both medically and economically. Businesses are going bankrupt and our global trade system will be changed forever. 

Our challenge is to use this time to correct our underlying economic problems and come back in a way that benefits all Americans. Either we will make the economic inequality greater, or we can generate a rising tide that lifts all boats. The rich are poised to buy up bankrupt businesses and assets and build the next generation of winning corporations. After all the suffering and sacrifice, do the people of this country want to benefit from the eventual economic renaissance, or be sidelined forever as a cheap temporary labor base competing for whatever jobs can no longer be automated.

When the next pandemic or other disaster hits, do you want to have economic security and medical coverage, or do you want to go through the type of stress and hardship that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing now. 

The United States is still, by far, the richest country in the world. Let’s come back in a way that preserves our freedom and way of life, but allows for more than 10% of us to prosper. 

Let’s examine some of the economic issues we were facing before COVID-19, as they have been exacerbated since.

&#x200B;

**Troubling facts before COVID-19**

**Corporations over People**

· Corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes – Individuals paid Income tax of $1,700B in 2019, while Corporations only paid 230B (only 11% of Fed tax revenue in 2019). That 2019 ratio calculates out to individuals paying 7.4X more than corporations. In the 1950’s, it was <2X.

· Corporations had been using the majority of their profits to buy back their own stock or pay dividends to shareholders – increasing Executive compensation instead of improving the company, compensating employees, or saving for a “rainy day”.

· Corporations use lobbying power and lax campaign financing rules to have an out-sized influence on our politicians, legislation, and policy.

· Corporations can shop which states to locate in, extracting incentives and low state and local taxes at the expense of the communities they leave as well as relocate to.

**Financial inequality**

· Income inequality - Over half of American workers make less than $30,000 per year. 40M American families need “food stamps” to get by.

· Wealth inequality - The median net worth was 65,000, and less than 15% of workers have a pension to fall back on – vs – 18.6 millionaires in the US (> 40% of global). Three people (Bezos, Gates, Buffet) have more net worth than the bottom half of Americans (160M people)

· Billionaires and other Ultra High Net Worth Individuals control Political Action Committees (PAC’s) that influence elections and political behavior to the benefit of the top 1%

**State inequality**

· Small states have as much as 4x the per capita “voting power” for their residents than the largest states due to inequities in the electoral college system 

· All states have 2 US Senators, but California has 68x the population of Wyoming

· NY, NJ, MA, CT, CA, and IL paid 319B more in Federal taxes than they received back in Federal spending (2015-18). VA, MD, KT, AL, FL and NC received 1,010B more from the Federal government than they paid in. (note: that the Fed government runs nearly a $1T budget deficit so overall the paybacks to states are 1.2x+ what they paid in

The pandemic has exacerbated these issues and viciously exposed the weaknesses and unfairness in our economic and social systems.  

&#x200B;

**Troubling economic effects from COVID-19**

**Corporations over People**

· The majority of Federal bail-out money went to Corporations and businesses, and not to help individuals. 

· Many corporations that spent the vast majority of their profits on stock buy-backs while the economy was strong, received Federal funding despite their bad business judgement. They reaped the reward, but didn’t take responsibility for the risk they took. If it is capitalism, there should be consequences, such as bankruptcy, for corporations who make bad decisions.

**Financial inequality**

· The vast majority of “essential workers” make less than $11/hour with little to no benefits. They are asked to take the risk of disease for the rest of us with very little financial benefit, and inadequate safety equipment and testing. \[Note: Minority populations are much more affected, but the subject of racial inequality is so huge and important that I will not attempt to go into that dimension here.\]

· Tens of millions of American workers are now unemployed, with very unknown prospects for getting back to work again. 

· With higher unemployment going forward, there will be downward pressure on wages for those who can keep their jobs.

· The wealthiest people who have cash to invest will buy up valuable assets and profit from this economic collapse. 

**State inequality**

· Weak Federal response to testing, tracing, and PPE not only created an environment where the United States has dramatically more COVID-19 cases and deaths than any other country in the world, but the State governments had to fend for themselves and pay inflated prices for whatever they could purchase.  In addition, unemployment and other benefits to individuals and families are paid by the State with little to minimal support from the Federal government.  With the concentration of cases in NY and NJ early on, those states had to absorb the most cost.

&#x200B;

How can we use this painful and terrible disruption to change things for the better? Here are some principles and objectives that the majority of Americans can get behind and demand get done.

&#x200B;

**Put People over Corporations** 

· Tax reform for Corporations – eliminate tax loopholes and reform the corporate tax structure so the Federal government takes in at least 1 corporate tax dollar for every $2 dollars paid in individual income tax. (Some areas of select focus should be eliminating overseas tax shelters and strictly limiting carry forward losses.)

· Eliminate stock buy backs – go back to the earlier rules where stock buy backs were not allowed and were treated as a form of insider trading. At a minimum, require all corporations to meet minimum pay and benefit requirements for their employees plus accumulate and hold enough cash to cover a year or two of operating costs before they can issue dividends or buy back any stock. 

· Eliminate tax breaks for stock options and awards. Strictly limit (or eliminate) the amount of executive pay that is tied solely to stock performance. 

· Campaign finance reform - Eliminate PAC’s and impose strict limits on donations plus maximum caps on election spending.

· Lobbying reform – put strict limits on corporate lobbying as well as strong oversight and governance on politicians getting any financial benefits from lobbyists or the businesses they represent (including jobs after their terms)

· Impose minimum corporate tax rates that all States must adhere to so companies can not drive down the state and local taxes they pay to rock bottom.

· For future emergencies, ensure that individual citizens are protected as a first step. No one should go hungry, lose their apartment/house, or need to worry about medical coverage. Those basic individual needs come first – before any discussions about business subsidies, bail-outs, or economic stimulus spending.

· When corporate bailouts are discussed, they must be in exchange for equity if the company has not saved enough cash to cover their costs for 1 year minimum. If the company paid dividends or did stock buy-backs, they would need to turn those shares over to the government before any government bailout money could be provided.  Bankruptcy will be more common when companies are not fiscally responsible, and the rights of workers will be protected above shareholders in bankruptcy settlements.

· Institute a single payer Government run Health care system that covers all Americans - removing corporate profit that Private Health Insurance companies currently extract to reduce overall per capita costs. 

· Reform Oil and Mining policies and legislation. The taxpayers need to get a much larger stake in resources that are extracted from American soil. The US should consider nationalizing the Oil industry, or, at least, setting up a sovereign fund similar to what Norway has. All other mining businesses need to be similarly treated.

· Basic utilities such as water and power should be nationalized. Utilities should be run for safety and efficiency and not a source of profit generation for corporations.

**Reduce financial inequality**

· All US citizens will get medical coverage as a basic right.

· The minimum wage will be raised to $15/hour and adjusted for inflation going forward.

· Estate Tax reform, including a requirement that all accrued investment capital gains are paid upon a person’s death before passing down as inheritance. 

· US corporations will bring manufacturing and outsourced jobs back to the US. This will be accomplished via tax penalties and incentives in additional to government oversight on the outsourcing of critical / essential / strategic industries. 

· The US government will shift domestic spending to programs and projects that increase jobs and improve people’s everyday lives. Focus will be on capital improvements and good paying jobs with benefits that bring value to our society.

· The US government will also focus on future job creating technologies by increasing investment in Research and Development and protecting the Intellectual Property (IP) that is created – including giving the government a financial stake in future profits for projects that have been invested in, as well as not allowing other countries to gain the IP without adequate financial compensation. Focus on innovation, which has traditionally been a powerful differentiator for the United States but is now languishing. Recognize that social media and similar technologies that focus on diverting attention to drive ad revenue are not actually advancing our society.

· Campaign finance reform. Eliminate PAC’s. Cap individual donations. Limit total spending allowed for campaigns. Elections should not have to be a multi-billion dollar media circus.

· For future emergencies, policies need to be in place to call out what jobs are considered essential and then pay those people a bonus in line with the risk they are being asked to take for the public benefit. This should be one small part of a pandemic plan that is well documented and ready to be executed instantly and without partisan bickering.

· As part of pandemic planning, the Federal government will need to be responsible for subsidizing the state unemployment pools to cover the increased costs due to government action.

**Fairness across the States of our Nation**

· The electoral college system must be eliminated. The US needs to enforce 1 person 1 vote.

· The role of the Senate needs to be reformed, with less power due to the inherent inequality of a system that gives low population States so much more per capita voting power.

· Every state should get back no more/less than 10% +/- back in Federal spending than they paid in through the Federal income tax of their residents. Any deficit spending by the Federal Government must also be allocated back to the states in proportion to the federal taxes paid by the people in that state.

· A pandemic plan (and other emergency plans) must be in place with funding to keep it current, actionable, and best of breed. Politics should be removed with quantifiable, fact-based rationale for when and where money is spent. State governments need to be compensated for their excess costs and individuals must be protected above businesses. The plan would define everything required to immediately execute testing, tracing, PPE manufacturing, etc. as appropriate, in a nationally coordinated manner. States should not have to compete for assistance.

These types of reforms will be hard to do in our current political climate, but we must demand bold change in order to fix the broken, corrupt, rigged system that has obviously failed us all. Corporations and Billionaires have gotten their way for many decades, but they got extremely greedy and took it too far. Now we need to try a different approach – a fair, balanced, humane, democratic approach that puts people’s quality of life ahead of the desires of a greedy few.",5,1.0,1594755092.0
t3_hrko0b,Singapore Economy On The Edge Of Recession; Government Blames Lockdown,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sddhq1d1sza51.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=197816ed7e789a3795ec3b35304b5ab99533d887

 In the wake of COVID-19, global economy has taken a hit. Unemployment is widespread, and all the economies are striving to stay afloat, while also trying to curb the spread of the virus. Lockdown with strict measures is being implemented across the world, which has frozen the operations of a lot of organizations.

Amid this global crisis, Singapore is hit by a major economic downfall in the second quarter as results Singapore slumps into recession. The Q2 FY2020 GDP shrank by as much as 41.2% as per the reports of Ministry of Trade and Industry, Singapore.

This massive blow in the figures is attributed majorly to the shrinking of the construction sector in Singapore. The construction sector almost vanished with a decline of 95.6% in the second quarter, while the manufacturing sector was down by 23.1% on-quarter.

In an official statement by the Singapore Government, the government stated that this decline in the economy was due to the Circuit Breaker (CB) measures that were implemented from 7th April to 1st June to control the spread of Covid-19 virus. These measures included the suspension of several non-essential services, which also included the closing down of many workplaces.

While construction and manufacturing sector have faced a major hit, service sector too saw a contraction of 37.7% on-quarter. Among the other services, tourism-related services like accommodation, airfare, have been severely affected due to the travel restrictions across the globe.

The economy of Singapore, free, competitive and innovative in nature was largely dependent on the trade. Because of the disruption of supply chain globally due to the lockdown and other restrictions, the economy has had a major hit.

Even then, there has been a substantial rise in the activities in the third quarter. But, it is not expected to have a positive growth until the first quarter of the next year.",4,0.84,1594806199.0

The standard took years after the initial target to finally kick in, because most banks were struggling with how to appropriately implement it. The implementation most banks chose had a negative consequence: in the case of an unfavorable credit downturn, the impact to earnings and capital would be compounded. 

Recent COVID legislation prohibited credit agencies from reporting delinquencies and negative news about credit quality of business and individuals. As a result, the true hit to credit quality is as yet unknown to most banks in Q2.

Once credit agencies can report deterioration of credit scores in Q3, there will be a major hit to bank capital. Some of the big players have been seen hoarding cash in early Q2 news. Q3 bank earning will be disastrous, and I see their capitalization ratios falling dangerously low. This will be compounded by expiration of other protections. Financial markets are in high danger. 

We will either see more high-price economic legislation passing in the next few months, or a breakdown in short-term functioning of the monetary system. I’d guess it’s a combination of the two.

t3_hvv7bp,The Federal Reserve,"The Federal Reserve. The Fed.

A source of numerous memes.

A topic that has recently reached the critical mass of mainstream consciousness.

A question that always lingers in the air is...who controls the Fed?

Before we can answer that deep question we need some context: what does the Fed do?

Officially...and unofficially.

&#x200B;

Officially, the Fed has four main responsibilities:

1. Conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices.
2. Supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers.
3. Maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets.
4. Providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, U.S. financial institutions, and foreign official institutions, and playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payments systems.

&#x200B;

***“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”***

Those are the words of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.

Unofficially, the Fed enriches the top 0.1% in a process known as the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), which basically states that money printing itself increases inequality via asset price inflation.

***Moreover, we currently have a situation whereby corporations run by executives with HUGE stock packages borrow money from Fed-fed banks for roughly free, buy back stock - thus boosting its price, then sell their own shares, using the proceeds to ""diversify"" into other assets (namely other stocks), expecting the Fed to keep the asset-inflation scheme going indefinitely.***

The recent spate of bailouts has highlighted the severity of the situation.

The Fed's policy of subsidising interest rates has incentivised corporations to borrow cheap money and buy back shares instead of saving cash for a rainy day.

The executives pocketing multi million dollar bonuses via this financial engineering should be chastised, but ultimately it is the Fed that facilitates this - just like it was the Fed who incentivised greedy bankers leading up to the '08 mortgage crisis.

&#x200B;

To understand who controls the Fed, we must go back to the Fed's formative years.

The year is 1910.

The month is December.

Senator Nelson Aldrich was a prominent American politician and a leader of the Republican Party in the United States Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1911.

As an aside, his daughter Abby actually married John D. Rockefeller Jr, son of the famous John D. Rockefeller.

Aldrich and six other men were about to embark on a journey to Jekyll Island, an island off the coast of Georgia, where there was an exclusive resort which counted the Morgans, the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts as members. 

These six men were:

Paul Warburg (a partner at the investment bank Kuhn, Loeb, and Co.);

Frank Vanderlip (president of National City Bank - now known as Citibank - and a former Treasury official);

Benjamin Strong (vice president of the Bankers Trust Company and the future founding chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York);

Henry Davison (a partner at J.P. Morgan);

Charles Norton (President of J.P. Morgan's First National Bank of New York);

and A.P. Andrew, who coincidentally was an economics professor at Harvard where he taught FDR, who would later sign Executive Order 6102 (otherwise known as the Great Gold Robbery of 1933).

Aldrich chose the attendees for their expertise, but he knew their ties to Wall Street could arouse suspicion about their motives and threaten the bill’s political passage.

So he went to great lengths to keep the meeting secret, adopting the ruse of a duck hunting trip and instructing the men to come one at a time to a train terminal in New Jersey, where they could board his private train car.

Once aboard, the men used only first names to prevent the staff from learning their identities.

For decades after, the group referred to themselves as the “First Name Club.”

A member of the exclusive Jekyll Island Club, most likely J.P. Morgan himself, arranged for the group to use the club’s facilities.

Munsey’s Magazine described this exclusive club as “the richest, the most exclusive, the most inaccessible” club in the world.

According to Frank Vanderlip:

***“I was secretive, indeed, as furtive as any conspirator. I do not feel it is an exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.***

***Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.”***

The bankers initially drafted the Federal Reserve as the “Aldrich Bill,” but when it came to Congress, they recognized Senator Aldrich’s name, became suspicious, and decided against passing the bill.

To make it sound more official, they decided to re-brand the bill as “The Federal Reserve Bill.” 

Three years after their historic meeting at Jekyll Island, The Federal Reserve Act was singed into law on December 23rd 1913, and with that a small group of bankers had the monopoly over creation of American money.

The Federal Reserve Act was originally granted a twenty-year charter to the Federal Reserve Banks, however on February 25th, 1927, it was extended indefinitely.

This proved crucial, as the sentiment in 1933 (nearing the end of the original 20 year charter) was not exactly positive with regards to the Fed.

Now the good thing is that, since then, the Fed have been held to account by [rigorous audits and comprehensive investigative procedures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqM2tFOxLQ)...

&#x200B;

On June 4th, 1963, US President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110, authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates.

This was the first of a series of moves to take control of US money back from the Federal Reserve by giving greater power to the Treasury.

On November 22nd, 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated.

&#x200B;

1861 was the beginning of the Civil War.

Abraham Lincoln was short of money to finance the North's war effort and went to the bankers of New York, who agreed to lend him money at interest rates varying from 24 to 36 percent.

Lincoln refused, but he still needed to solve his money problem.

Colonel Dick Taylor came to the rescue and put the solution to him:

***“Just get Congress to pass a bill authorising the printing of full legal tender treasury notes, and pay your soldiers with them, and go ahead and win your war with them also.”***

This is what Lincoln did: and on February 25, 1862, Congress passed the first Legal Tender Act, which authorized the issuance of $150 million greenbacks.

(These Treasury notes were called “Greenbacks” by the people because they were printed with green ink on the back.)

***Lincoln called these Greenbacks “the greatest blessing the American people have ever had.”***

A blessing for all, except the bankers, since it was putting an end to their racket (i.e. the stealing of the nation's credit and issuing interest-bearing money).

So they did everything possible to destroy these Greenbacks and sabotage Lincoln's work.

Lincoln said:

***“I have two great enemies, the Southern army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. And of the two, the bankers are my greatest foe.”***

Lincoln was re-elected President in 1864, and he made it quite clear that he would attack the power of the bankers once the civil war was over. The civil war ended on April 9, 1865...

Lincoln was assassinated six days later, on April 15.

&#x200B;

The central bank in each country is the legal entity that manages the nation’s money supply and can lend money, with interest of course, to the government and other private banks in the country. This is how it all works:

1. When the government needs more money, they ask the treasury department for money by issuing an IOU or government bond, which is a bond issued by the national government with a promise to pay periodic interest payments and to repay the face value on the maturity date.
2. The Treasury (an executive department of government) receives the bond from the government and forwards it to the nation’s Central Bank.
3. The Central Bank (a privately owned bank and the entity that owns the monetary system of the nation) then writes a check to the commercial banks in the country for the value of the bond and authorises them to create this new money. This central bank, of course, just invents money out of thin air.

For more clarity, we can refer to ""Putting it Simply"", released in 1984 by the Public Services Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

***“When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our accounts to cover the check. But when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money”***

4. The commercial banks then type numbers on a screen and create money out of nothing. At this exchange at the private banks, money is *officially* created and can be used to pay government bills.

&#x200B;

Another part of this money creation system happens at the commercial banks.

***Every time you take out a loan, banks simply type in some numbers digitally in your account and charge you interest on it. So basically, each time the bank makes a loan, the bank doesn’t use other people’s deposited money to loan to you. It creates new money by typing digits into a computer.***

***97% of all money is generated that way. Only 3% is the physical paper cash and coins that we carry.***

Moreover, commercial banks lend out up to 10 times more money than they actually have in reserves; a practice known as fractional reserve lending.

To demonstrate how absurdly the system is currently leveraged, that [reserve requirement has recently been cut to zero.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm) Yes, zero.

&#x200B;

So who controls the Fed?

Well, an international Cartel of Central Bankers, more ruthless and more intelligent than Escobar or El Chapo ever were.

A Cartel who have effectively perfected a form of modern slavery; with debt taking the place of chains...and Central Bankers playing the role of Masters.

I close with a quote from Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's father:

***""Even if it were desirable, America is not strong enough to police the world by military force. If that attempt is made, the blessings of liberty will be replaced by coercion and tyranny at home.""***

t3_hxv21e,International Trade Question,"Hello, me again!

&#x200B;

I was arguing with the same libertarian friend as last time about whether or not we need international trade regulation and I thought you all would be able to help me out here. Basically, I was wondering if my arguments were valid/what I'm missing. Here goes:

Lib: ""We don't need international trade rules, trade is between one entity and another. Trade rules only serve to limit competition because they restrict who I can buy from and where I can get stuff. A perfect example of this is the American drug market. Insulin is radically expensive in the United States but shockingly cheap in Canada and Mexico. Now, as I've explained to you before, this is because the US effectively subsidizes their drugs. Because other countries have Universal Health Care, drug companies can't make a profit on them, so they offload all their costs of production and distribution here as well as their need to get a profit. This is why drugs are so expensive. Now, that's a side topic. Imagine if we didn't have rules that prevented me from buying drugs abroad. Prices were equalize overnight because now the American market is every market, and drug producers can't offload all costs on us.""

Me: Ok, so first off this fails to address a key reason we have international trade treaties: disputes and harmonization. If I want to sell a product in Canada, I obviously need to follow their rules. However, it is cheaper for me to have one set of a machinery and one set of tools. However, if Vietnam has completely different regulations, I will need another set. That's expensive and ridiculous. Plus, how do you resolve disputes? What court do you use?

Lib: That question shows your inexperience. In practically every contract, the court to use is decided ahead of time. Plus, Canada may have more stringent rules than Vietnam, so a country should just comply with the more stringent rules and they're bound to be fine.

Me: Ok, what if the rules contradict each other? So, say that Canada required that the maple trees I'm getting sap from must be from quebec, but vietnam says that they must come from Illinois (this is a plainly ridiculous example and completely made up, but I couldn't think of anything of the top of my head cause i don't spend my free time memorizing maple syrup regulations for countries around the world). Plus, complying with more stringent regulations is expensive, which can easily screw over poor countries.

Lib: Ok, but again these regulation disputes can be worked out in a contract between two trading parties.

Me: Imagine how difficult it would be to sign so many individual contracts. It would be much better to do that on a national level.

Lib: That's why I advocate bilateral treaties

Me: But those come up with their own set of issues. It's easy for big countries to bully little countries and treat certain countries better. That can easily lead to insulation of domestic firms from foreign competition.

Was I right in the end? Was he right? Is there something else I could've said, or that he could've said? Thanks!",3,1.0,1595714214.0

t3_hzcxgt,U.S. Employment Report Preview for July: Several Indicators Suggest Labour Market Deteriorated," [As I already flagged in early July](https://www.christophe-barraud.com/u-s-high-frequency-data-suggest-that-economic-recovery-has-stalled-amid-virus-resurgence) and [more recently](https://www.christophe-barraud.com/en/u-s-high-frequency-indicators-confirm-economic-recovery-has-stalled-since-late-june),  U.S. high frequency indicators confirmed that economic recovery has stalled since late June. More specifically, the employment market has  showed signs of weakness. 

1-  The Census Bureau’s weekly Household Pulse Survey showed that “*The  number of employed Americans declined by about 6.7 million from mid-June  through mid-July, including a 4.1 million plunge from the first to the  second week of July*”. 

2-  [Saint Louis Fed economists](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/june/reading-labor-market-real-time), that use [real-time data from Homebase](https://joinhomebase.com/data/) to track labour market trend, see a decline in July.

3-  The Labor Department said last Thursday that initial jobless claims  came in at 1.416 million for the week ending July 18 (above the  consensus of 1.300 million). It was the 18th straight week in which  initial claims totaled more than 1 million, and it snapped a 15-week  streak of declines. 

 All in all, it seems that employment situation no longer improved and  even deteriorated slightly in July compared to June, reflecting the halt  of the reopening process in several states. Even if it’s a bit early to  look at the consensus for July NFP, the first guess of +2.0M looks  elevated.

***Founded by math genius Jim Simons, flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988 (with an average net return of 39.1% after fees!).***

The Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.

Since, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.

Now, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).

Medallion has a 5% management fee.

From 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee.

From 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.

In 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%

***To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM.***

That certainly beats inflation...

So, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy!)?

&#x200B;

**PART 1: The Early Stages**

Early on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.

Remember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!

***“I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,” Simons said. “A pure system without humans interfering.”***

Simons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information

Straus was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.

He became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.

Over time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.

In fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!

***At the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.***

The return in 2008 is a prime example of that.

Commodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.

The fund wasn't bothered as to *why* these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.

&#x200B;

**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**

Now in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the ""best math department in the world"".

Therefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.

***We are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.***

RenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.

The strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).

Simons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.

In 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.

This test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.

It had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.

Magerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.

Finally, the simulator’s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.

The resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman’s calculations.

Only then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good.

&#x200B;

**PART 3: Infrastructure**

Now I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.

Big data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.

***The problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high: building a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.***

To then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.

RenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.

***They have completely automated the process of signal discovery: they don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.***

RenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.

The data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.

***The mathematics of efficiently processing that data are what matters.***

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

**The takeaway from this is the following:** [do not day trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9JcFAadCVo)**, you will get REKT.**

**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MONEY LAUNDERING ADVICE. ALWAYS CONSULT A TOP NOTCH TEAM OF LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTING EXPERTS WHEN LOOKING TO LAUNDER MONEY PROFESSIONALLY.**

Let's begin...

***Step 1***: John Doe is an art dealer. He persuades his friends Alice and Bob to buy works by an up and coming young artist, for $2 million each, on the understanding that they will be a good investment.

***Step 2:*** Over the next few years, John Doe uses his position to hype the artist. He hires people to write about the artist in academic journals, organises exhibitions, helps the artist to 'win' prizes, etc.

***Step 3:*** John Doe puts some of the artist's works into auctions, and bids the prices up with the help of friends. As he is ultimately buying from himself, the only cost is the auctioneer's commission.

***Step 4:*** Ten years later, Alice and Bob own works that are worth, on paper at least, $10 million.

***Step 5:*** In the meantime, Alice has just pulled off the real estate deal of a lifetime, and made a huge profit. Unfortunately, she now owes the IRS $10 million.

***Step 6:*** She decides to donate the painting to her local modern art museum. The trustees are happy to state it's value at $10 million. The IRS accepts the valuation and allows Alice to write of her $10 million tax bill. She is now a noted philanthropist, and she gets a wing of the museum named after her.

***Step 7:*** Bob, on the other hand, isn't doing so well. He needs cash quick, but he can't sell his painting on the open market - because it isn't worth very much without John Doe manipulating the price.

***Step 8:*** Bob goes to his bank and asks for a loan, using the painting as collateral. However, the bank wants an independent assessment of its value, so they ask a world expert on this particular artist - John Doe. John Doe confirms that, based on previous auction prices, it's worth $10 million.

***Step 9:*** The bank agrees to lend Bob 70% of the value - $7 million.

***Step 10:*** So Alice has saved herself $10 million in taxes from an initial outlay of $2 million. And Bob has got himself $7 million to play with from an initial outlay of $2 million.

**At the end of the day,**

**Art is like fiat currency.**

**Paint a bunch of pieces of paper green and claim they're worth as much as a house, or a mansion, or even a super-yacht.**

t3_i2ef1p,The Cantillon Effect,"Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified - thus even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about.**

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. 

If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

**Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.**

For instance, the financial sector has contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited.

**In other words, the phenomenon of asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

During Monday’s daily briefing, Trump and White House experts calculated that there will be between 50,000 and 60,000 deaths in the US by the end of the outbreak, **“Right now we are heading to 50 thousand and according to the projections we will end up with 60 thousand by the end of the pandemic,” the US president said.**

## Eight Republican governors won't issue stay-at-home orders

On Sunday, Adm. Adams said his message to the eight Republican governors that haven't issued stay-at-home orders will be to consider even just a temporary shutdown.

""If you can't give us a month, give us a week ... give us what you can,"" pleaded Adm. Adams

The eight Republican governors have offered a range of excuses for why they haven't followed 42 other governors that have issued stay-at-home orders

**03/30/2020**

President Trump told governors on a conference call Monday that he “hasn’t heard about testing in weeks,” suggesting that a chronic lack of kits to test people for the coronavirus is no longer a problem.

But governors painted a different picture on the ground.

“Literally we are one day away, if we don’t get test kits from the C.D.C., that we wouldn’t be able to do testing in Montana,” Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat, said, according to an audio recording of the conversation [obtained by The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/politics/trump-governors-coronavirus-testing.html).

Speaking in a White House Rose Garden news conference after the call, Mr. Trump also said that so many American companies were now producing ventilators, the United States would soon have supplies to send to hard-hit Europe.

**02/27/2020**

The president scheduled an evening press conference to address how the administration is handling the virus threat.

In advance, Trump played down the mortality rate for a pathogen that has been confirmed to have killed 2,700 people globally. His top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, echoed Trump’s outlook, saying Tuesday that the U.S. had “contained” the threat of a domestic outbreak.",11,0.82,1596336914.0

''The days leading up to my dad’s demise, traumatic as they were, pale in comparison to what patients seriously ill with Covid-19 have to endure. If they survive being on ventilators, then many of them have months and months of arduous recovery ahead. If they die, they die alone, surrounded not by family, but by masked doctors and nurses in full protective gear, far removed from the kind of human contact my father and his family were fortunate to have before he passed.

I came to this realization more than seven months after my father died. The virus had already ravaged Italy, Spain, and New York state when tweets from a doctor from San Francisco started appearing in my Twitter feed. [Ethan Weiss](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/ethan.weiss), a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, had flown to New York City in late April to volunteer his services at a hospital there. From New York, he began tweeting long accounts of his days as an intensive care unit (ICU) doctor treating seriously ill Covid-19 patients on ventilators. The diary entry that caught my eye read: “[Day Four: Not the fucking flu](https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1256029025035644928).”

[**Triage: Deciding Who Lives and Dies Amid Covid-19**](https://undark.org/2020/03/29/ethics-covid19-shortages-health-care/)

On that day, he lamented about Covid-19, writing, “This is not a way anyone should die. These poor people are tied to a bed for 20-40+ days with a tube shoved down their throats, unable to speak, delirious and disoriented, in pain, drugged, weak, tired, starving, scared, and entirely alone.” ''

t3_i3f89w,What does President Trump’s suspension of H-1B visa mean and how will it impact Indians?,"  

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump's announcement in July, to suspend H-1B visas, which came as a shock for Indian IT experts, alongside other foreign visas for the rest of 2020. 

President Donald Trump called it a necessary measure and said it would help a large number of Americans whose jobs are lost because of the Covid-19 and the economic crisis. The suspension of visas would be in place till the end of this year and in the near future, we will decide on expanding the suspension or lifting it if needed, the *CNN* reported.

The proclamation implies that foreign nationals, dependants, and spouses that are stuck in India on an H-1B visa or even L-1 visas, do not hold a legitimate visa, including dependents, will have wait for the lifting of visas suspension until the end of 2020, *The First Post* reported.

According to the Trump administration's announcement, anybody on an H4, H-1B, H2A, and J1 visa who didn't hold a valid visa as of 24th June would not be permitted to travel to the nation till December 31. 

The H-1B visa permits US companies to temporarily employ workers from abroad in specialty jobs. The occupation will require a specialized degree or equivalent work experience for getting recruited. The length of a stay is three years and can be further extended to six years. When this period gets over, the visa holder will need to re-apply for a visa. 

The President's announcement came as millions of US citizens applied for unemployment benefits due to the coronavirus crisis and its aftermaths, such as job cuts, fewer wages, businesses getting shut, economic crisis, etc. 

However, the new measures would imply that priority will be given to Americans for jobs and the people who don't have a valid visa as of June 23 and are outside the US, won't be permitted to enter the nation until December 31, 2020. 

In addition, the official order that was marked by Trump additionally says that the H-1B visas will not be decided via a lottery system. The new guidelines would be in support of highly skilled workers.

t3_i4g36g,The stock market is not the economy?,"Found the following post on LinkedIn. Sounds very interesting and think it makes a lot of sense.. Perhaps someone with more expert knowledge could share their opinions?

Post: 

The wheel is not the car. Still sucks when you get a flat tire.

The thing I find frustrating/confusing when economists say that ""the stock market is not the economy"", is that retirement funds, especially in the USA, have a high degree of stocks in their portfolio. When the boomers cannot afford to retire, that has a significant effect on the economy.

Also, the ability for companies to grow, produce goods and pay their employees, is closely linked to it's ability to raise capital. Most companies find the capital they need to achieve scale by going public on the stock market.

I think this saying is becoming popular now because of the disconnect between consumer spending and stock prices pumped up by the increase of the money supply. That increase is captured at the big bank level, who loan to big corporations, who buy back their own stock. But when the bubble bursts, the stock market will feel like it's part of the economy again.

When our children are paying skyrocketing taxes to pay back the debt on this money printing catastrophe, that will also be the economy.

I think a better term might be, ""Your Stake is Fake"".

I am not great at economics, but I have heard that our system of capitalism depends on constant growth. As far as I understand, businesses are dependent on investors to get off the ground, and investors are willing to invest because on average a business can be expected to grow. I think this is enabled by technological innovations and by growing levels of education worldwide.

What if we have a world without that?

To be more specific, in the world I have in mind:

* Technology is at an early industrial stage (1800s) and has been stagnant for a few hundred years.
* There are no new lands to feasibly exploit.
* The supply of energy (their equivalent of fossil fuels) is stable or slowly declining.
* Due to pollution and exploitation of non-renewable resources, the total area of livable and arable land is slowly declining.

What might this do to the economic system? Is it feasible for a kind of capitalism to dominate, or do you think this setting is more conducive to some other economic system, e.g. a kind of centralized ""palace economy"" or a kind of feudalism?

There are also no market forces causing raw material prices to go up for the most part. And wages certainly aren't going up. So costs aren't going to push inflation. 

Sure the Fed is pumping money into the economy, but none of that money is going to poor/average people. It is going to rich people, who have nothing real to invest it in, because people are poor, so investing money in making anything new is silly because there is no more money to get from people. So the rich just invest their money in stocks. And so stocks keep going up, because rich people have nothing else to do with their money. And so we are stuck in a cycle. The government feeds money into the economy. The rich siphon off just enough to actually put into the economy to keep poor/average people treading water. And they put the rest in the stock market to make their existing money worth even more.

The scene is set in a thick forest where greenery is plentiful and animals are chilled. Animals are at peace all doing what they do best. 

The fox is bored with this lovely life. Decides to cook up a story to have some fun. 

Says that there's a feast on the other side of the forest and starts running ""towards it"" and as he meets more animals, convinces them that they need to join him in the sprint to the feast. Initially hesitant, they join in for the treat, first a few hungry ones and then, as the word gets around, more and more, even the healthy ones.

A large number of animals are now desperately running ""to get to the feast"" ... Which they believe to be true since ""someone told them about it"".

Having achieved what he set out to, the fox decides to chill, stop running and enjoy the panic. He loves his creation. Laughs at the foolish animals who are headed to the invisible feast. ""How clever"" he thought of himself as he sat in the comfort of his favourite tree, seeing the huge crowds run.

Days become weeks and months and an increasing numbers of animals are ""rushing to the feast"". Continues unabated. 

After a while, when this gets boring, the Fox tries to tell them that it's all a made up story and there is no such feast, and it's all make believe. But none of them will have it. They're only increasing their numbers and pace. Some think the fox is trying to talk them out of the feast for his own selfish gains or that he's too lazy to participate in the feast.

He can't seem to ignore that the crowds are increasing with days. Finally one day the fox thinks ""I know there isn't any real feast, but WHAT IF IT'S TRUE""?! 

The fox decides to join the run too.

For the thousands of Bangladeshi workers stuck in Lebanon, the Beirut blast was the last straw. They were already facing immense hardship due to the economic downturn with many losing their jobs or facing wage cuts. Some say their employers still owe them several months’ wages which they are unable to pay. Even those that do, can only do so in Lebanese pounds which has rapidly become worthless. Amidst this came the explosion which has damaged many of their homes and led to further job loss.

Close to 1.5 lakh Bangladeshis (80,000 of them women) are living in Lebanon and at least a fifth of them are undocumented workers. Many of them live in the Greater Beirut area which has been severely affected by the blast.

t3_ifnmi0,Why Yields Are About To Rise,"1- US interest rates are the fulcrum of the global financial system. Almost the entirety of this fulcrum, from 3-months out to 30-years, is below 1%. How much further can this trend go? Long-term we’re headed for total yield suppression with full-on Japan-style yield curve control. But it’s not going to be a straight trend from here to there and we’re likely headed for a bump pretty soon…

2-Falling yields (bonds up, yields down) have driven the stock/bond ratio to multi-decade lows. Its z-score (red circles) is at levels that have marked major reversals in stock/bond relative performance in the past. Stocks and bonds compete for capitam flows. A rotation out of safety and into risk might soon be underway.                                                                                                                                                         

3- The bears who’ve been sitting on the sidelines of the equity rally off the March lows don’t understand the financial concept of relativity. Asset allocation is a choice of comparisons that contain a number of critical feedback loops. The rate of change in US Baa yields recently fell to its lowest level since 2003. These levels are more consistent with a major bottom in stocks, not a top.

4- But as I’ve been pointing out the last few weeks, it appears there’s a major trend change brewing. The MOVE index (a measure of bond volatility) is at all-time lows. Compression regimes lead to expansionary ones. And there are some growing signs of important divergence. Here’s a chart showing 10yr Breakevens pulling away from UST 10yr yields. Also, keep an eye on cyclical vs. defensives over the coming weeks.

5- What could drive this trend change in yields? Growth and inflation expectations… Or rather, things not turning out as bad as most were expecting them to. 

6- Veteran market technician [Martin Pring tweeted](https://twitter.com/martin_pring/status/1291760157098225664) this chart and wrote: “The long-term momentum for ISM New Orders has turned up.

7- Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent report that “The global recovery is progressing well and is transiting from the sharp jump in monthly indicators in May-June to a natural moderation in the pace of improvement since July as we have already made up a lot of lost ground. Retail sales in both the US and EA are already close to or above their Jan-20 peaks; global manufacturing and services PMIs moved back into the expansionary territory in July and electricity consumption is now growing on a YoY basis in EMs ex-China like India and Brazil, which were lagging earlier.”

10- We’ve been bullish precious  metals for a while and ultimately believe they’re headed much higher. But if our intermediate bond thesis plays out, then crowded and extended precious metals should get pinched hard. Gold is now four Std Devs above its 200-week moving average.

t3_ifg526,Why Must Money Inflate Or Deflate In Value When There Is More Or Less Of It In Total?,"TL;DR Why does fictional money fluctuate in value, despite seemingly not having a need to.

Why does the value of currency fluctuate in the modern era? In the United States, a 100 dollar benjamin is worth exactly 100$. We all collectively agreed that this cloth bill is worth that much and can be exchanged for goods or services up to 100$. So if we say its worth 100$ why does inflation or deflation affect its true value? In the past when the currency was backed by a resource, usually gold, the available money supply, as a result, was much smaller and less fluid.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So when the next economic crash occurred and everyone came screaming to the banks demanding all of their money back, the banks simply didn't have enough gold to give to everyone due to fractional reserve banking, as a result, millions of people lost their fortunes and sent the economy plummeting downward into a recession.

In modern times, however, the VAST majority of wealth lies digitally on computer servers and the overwhelming majority of transactions also occur digitally via debit cards or credit cards.  Now a debit card has a few distinct advantages over gold, it's significantly easier to transport, it's very difficult to steal the wealth it possesses and almost universally your wealth is backed by the full force and faith of the United States.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So let's say another economic crash happens due to say oh I don't know the world's most lethal pandemic in almost a century. What happens when people rush to the banks demanding the value their plastic cards hold? Well one of 2 things really, either they A request the central bank to print them more money to give to said distraught customers to make them feel better or B tell the customers that their money isn't able to be handed over because it's just digits in a computer system but is still able to be spent as normal.

Does this cause the same issue to the economy the first bank rush caused when there wasn't enough gold to go around? I don't believe so, as far as I can understand it we as society trade our time and our labor in exchange for a unit of value, we then trade this unit of value for the goods or services produced by other people who are trying to acquire said unit of value so they themselves can perpetuate the cycle. In this type of system, people are able to specialize into different career paths that provide a far greater collective value to everyone involved in perpetuating the system than if everyone was forced to work as a burger flipper at burger king for example.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So if deflation (reduction in total number) of a currency can't directly increase the value of a set unit of value due to universal availability. Then all, that's left to deal with is the possibility that too many people acquire such a significant amount of said unit of value that they cease to participate in the cycle of value exchange. Or in other words, because they already have so much money they don't need to produce any goods or service in order to survive, so they cease to do so.

This, however, seems like a rather trivial problem to overcome, a simple wealth % scaling based tax combined with a unit of value ceiling would entirely eliminate this possibility from happening. Put simply tax those that hold large sums of wealth proportionate to the amount they hold/make and put a maximum limit to the wealth that can be accumulated by one individual. This would ensure that ALL members of society would need to CONTINUE to contribute to the larger economy moving forward while also having the benefit of new tax revenues available for the funding of more robust public services.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

At the end of the day perhaps,I am missing something critical in my analysis of wealth and value within a society but as it stands based off my current understanding I see no good reason a fictional currency we designated the value of should change simply due to its availability, beyond archaic systems of power perpetuation.

U.S. prosecutors are preparing to charge Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. with conspiring with competitors to raise prices for generic drugs, according to a person familiar with the matter.

&#x200B;

The Justice Department is planning to charge Teva as soon as Tuesday after the company rebuffed a settlement that would have required paying a criminal penalty and admitting wrongdoing, said the person, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.

# US charges ex-CEO of drug company with fraud tied to Teva tender offer

Tue Aug 25, 2020 2:31 NEW YORK - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday announced insider trading charges accusing the former chief executive of Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc with tipping friends and family about an anticipated tender offer for his company by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.TA in 2015.

&#x200B;

Prosecutors in New York said the defendant, Sepehr Sarshar,misappropriated material nonpublic information from Auspexrelated to the tender offer, resulting in trades that generatedapproximately $700,000 of illegal profit.

&#x200B;

Sarshar, 53, of Encinitas, California, was charged with three fraud counts.

# Drug firm bets it won't be charged

In the coming days, the Justice Department will decide whether to file criminal charges against one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies suspected of colluding with rivals to inflate the prices of widely used drugs.

&#x200B;

The company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, is betting that in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the Trump administration won't dare to come down hard on the largest supplier of generic drugs in the United States.

&#x200B;

It is a high-stakes gamble that could affect millions of Americans who rely on Teva's dozens of inexpensive generic drugs, as well as its brand-name products like Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis, and Ajovy, for migraines. Teva officials say criminal charges could cripple the Israeli company and potentially leave it unable to sell drugs to federal programs like Medicare.

&#x200B;

For years, the Justice Department and state prosecutors have been investigating what they describe as a conspiracy by pharmaceutical companies to increase the prices of popular drugs. The department has already extracted guilty pleas and $224 million in penalties from four other drug companies.

&#x200B;

***As president or prime minister, Putin has led Russia for more than two decades and if, sorry when, he runs in the next elections in 2024 and 2030, he will be in charge longer than any ruler since Peter the Great.***

Putin would be 83 by the time of the 2036 election!

Putin has caused controversy over the annexation of Crimea, bounty programs in Afghanistan, poisoning of former spies, and treatment of Political opponents at home.

Putin's net worth has been a source of intense speculation.

***He reportedly has access to over 20 palaces and villas - the most notable of which is known as the not-so-secret ""secret palace"", which cost $1 billion to build, and is reported to be almost eight million square feet.***

Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, who was assassinated in 2015, produced a dossier claiming that Putin owned multiple private jets, helicopters and yachts.

Speaking of yachts, the dossier claimed Putin has a collection of four yachts - the most notable of which, the Rossiya, was upgraded in 2005 for a staggering cost of $1.2 billion.

&#x200B;

Quick sidenote, and disclaimer: this is not yacht advice, but if you do have a yacht, [take a look at what Chelsea owner Roman Abramovic did with Eclipse](https://www.wired.com/2009/09/russian-billionaire-installs-anti-photo-shield-on-giant-yacht/), his superyacht valued at up to $1.5 billion.

Now as well as having two helipads, two swimming pools and six-foot movie screens in all guest cabins, a mini-submarine and a missile defense system, Eclipse has an anti-paparazzi “shield”.

The law firm’s internal files show how minions and proxies created structures to hide and move the secret wealth. 

A Kremlin spokesperson described the media articles as ""an attack"" and ""a series of fibs"".

&#x200B;

Loyalty and long-held relationships help bind the network together. 

It is a fraternity of Putin confidants.

***If they are loyal, then they can keep their status as billionaires roaming {get it, roman...roaming} the seas in superyachts.***

A Mafia type structure where Omerta is the code.

Nobody mentions the name Putin. Ever.

&#x200B;

But what is the true extent of Putin's Wealth?

According to [financier Bill Browder](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/31/financier-bill-browder-says-vladimir-putin-is-worth-200-billion.html), Putin is worth $200 billion. 

***This is the real kicker; Putin is fiercely intelligent and realised early on that whatever system is claimed (whether a society claims to be capitalist or communist) the globe has been a PLUTOCRACY since time immemorial. Therefore, to truly have the power Putin knew that he must have the fortune.***

Don't get me wrong, Putin is no Angel - the dude is cold and ruthless - and is pretty much a modern day Emperor. 

However, that doesn't change the fact that every time he speaks I like him more (although perhaps that is an indictment of the quality of Politicians in the West...).

**PARTNERSHIPS**

\- Partnership with Instacart

Recently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart’s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.

\- Partnership with Shopify

In addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item’s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart’s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart’s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.

\- Partnership with ThredUp

Walmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable’s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would’ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.

\- Google

Walmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.

\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)

Walmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.

Since the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.

**Acquisitions**

\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel

Let’s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO’s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.

\- Jet.com

The first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce.

\- Flipkart

Ever heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart’s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.

\- TikTok acquisition

Some very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok’s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart’s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.

**Walmart PLUS**

Word is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year

**2 Hour Delivery**

Walmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.

**5000+ US stores.**

This is Walmart’s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.

**Some other interesting facts to consider.**

\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.

\- Walmart’s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%

\- Walmart’s expansion in Africa, India, China.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/TLDR**

Let me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.

Walmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.

t3_inp84v,Several thoughts about the US economic model,"Why US are the biggest and the richest economy in the world, and have so many social problems and deep inequality?

First – why it is the biggest and the richest? At fist look it seems US have better economics model than the other countries. But I do not think this is the case. US have unique location and history. They are protected from the competition by two oceans at east and west side. At north Canada because of the climate cannot support big enough population to be a competitor, and at south Mexico is a typical subtropical country, where is easier to develop the agriculture, and the industry struggles.

As history – the viruses brought by the Europeans killed most the native population: nobody really knows how many millions died. That freed an enormous area of land and resources.

The result is a period of peace without a precedent in the human history. Since the Civil war there was not a major conflict on the US continental soil. So more than 150 years without forced destruction of the economy. Meanwhile every other big country with temperate climate was destroyed multiple times by wars. I think this is in general the secret of the US wealth.

Now let look at the present. How the US economy works, and why generates so much debt. Since the WW2, because of the stability – no wars, and the market – the only big economy that was not destroyed by the war, US dollar became the world’s reserve currency.

So now Fed counts on that to print money. Then the private banks and the federal government take that money and give most to private companies – that means private profits, bonuses and buybacks of shares. This is not a bad model in general. But in US it has several big issues.

Many social services are privatized. And that makes them very expensive – as the price includes the private profits, bonuses and buybacks of shares. That creates whole private sectors in the economy that lay on the federal money. And if we add the constant attempt for growth of the private companies, that leads to debt spiral.

There is a paradox – if the US minimize the share of the private sector in the social services, so they increase the federal spending, the overall cost will be reduced significantly.

The lack of adequate social services and protection is the main reason why the inequality leads to conflicts and confrontation. Also that situation effectively suppresses and limits the opportunities for the poor, so their children also become poor and etc. And that strengthens the inequality through the generations.",3,0.8,1599410519.0

 An argument fiscal conservatives always put forward is that even if you  start with nothing, the harder you work, the more money you will make.  This implies that people who are relegated to govt benefits must be lazy  and useless.

In order to account all intra-country transactions, the Modi-led government has approached public and private sector banks to push customers for executing their all transactions right from paying for grocery and recurring monthly payments to every business dealings. However, the surveillance over the foreign remittances was difficult as taxpayers were not displaying the foreign transactions while filing for income tax returns.

To curtail the tax avoidance by assesses, the Indian administration has introduced Tax collection at source (TCS) a new sub-section (1G) in Section 206C under Finance Act, 2020 which will be implemented from October 01, 2020. The introduction of new guidelines will bring taxes into the hands of government at the time of making payments, which will eradicate the hindrance of tax avoidance on foreign remittances and payments.

However, how is TikToks's business modell in the US different from US tech firms' business model in Europe (and, indeed, in the US itself)?

It is stated that TikTok has the potential to become a threat to national security.

t3_j4eky9,What strategy can the US implement in order to save its economy ?,"As a Swedish citizen, it seems our government has dealt with the corona situation differently.

The consensus of our health leadership is that of “ recommendations “ rather than enforcing rules effectively causing mass spread. For which it has been very scrutinized. 

The entire strategy revolves around “herd immunity” without stating it outright and has been something that the Swedish population has grown to accept. The government here actually promotes NOT using masks, not stating at home if you think you have been exposed etc. ( the only recommendation now is that people 20 years and older should stay home if someone in their household tests positive for COVID, not that they are sick, but actually tested positive and they DON’T have a society-bearing job )  It has been very clinical and callous, almost sociopathic in a sense as the reasoning now is not about saving lives but rather saving the economy.

Sweden has avoided an economic collapse but has one of the largest death per citizen numbers in the world. 

In a sense, people here seem very callous compared to the warm and emotional nature of the US population. I know that I am not an individual to my government but only a number. 

* the Swedish government promotes NOT using facemasks as it would be a logistical and economic nightmare, people would get scared and might stay home because of fear etc. It would better serve the economy if people carried on with their daily lives, working etc.

* They indirectly promote that getting antibodies and getting sick is an advantage over locking the society as it serves the economy with only a more strict recommendation of people of very old age and comorbidities should stay home if possible.  

* To put it bluntly - We expect people we have near and dear to die in order to save the economy. And whoever “ gets sick” is at his or her own fault for putting themselves at risk.

Having this as context;

The current US administration seems to have wanted to go with the same strategy as Sweden regarding the pandemic but has been met with an extreme amount of resistance by the US population. It almost seems like the US lockdown ( at least from a Swedish perspective ) was only implemented to apease the opposition and later again declaring that the economy would not survive if people did not work - again returning to the “ Swedish narrative “.

That last part might be extremely speculative but that notion has been passed around Swedish news outlets and discussed. With a primary argument that the US administration must have had a calculated plan to save the economy and that locking down over a long time would only “destroy the economy”. And that with such a giant apparatus that the US economy is, it just makes no sense locking down without a major reason. 

My question now is, with Sweden’s growing economy compared to our neighboring countries economies failing - what could the US do in it’s current situation ? 

Can it save it’s economy by going the callous Swedish route ? 

Can the US “ survive “ without collapsing and if so, how ? 

I do not condone what Sweden has done nor do I have an opinion on it, as I am not an expert regarding this topic in any way. I am just searching for discussion and perspective.

t3_j4dw87,The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.

However, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

*“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.""*

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. 

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. 

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:

*""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""*

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. 

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

1. Divide and Conquer and
2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)

As we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...

Speaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information. 

Information feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.

A fantastic example of this process is what has happened with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

The real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...

**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**

The depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future.

Now this will not necessarily happen straight away.

However, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism is inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.

From a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.

Essentially, this means that the value of the network increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.

An asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.

[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.

t3_j7ag47,Credit Creation for Asset Transactions,"Let's discuss banks.

Specifically, *commercial* banks.

Commercial banks are what we think about when somebody says ""bank"".

A commercial bank is a deposit-taking institution that can lend out money.

People go to the bank for a car loan, a mortgage, but wait:

***Where does the money come from?***

Well, out of thin air.

The bank literally types digits into the computer.

Contrary to blue-pilled belief, the bank does *not* use other people's deposited money to loan you money.

***It creates money out of thin air - credit creation.***

97% of the money supply is created by banks.

Only 3% of the money supply is physical cash, and that number is certain to decrease as [cash is dangerous now](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/24/uk-cash-usage-halves-in-few-days) remember...

Therefore, banks are the control centre of the entire economy, since they create money and decide who gets money *for what purpose*.

Do the banks create money for productive purposes, boosting GDP and job creation, reducing inequality?

***Nope, for the last few decades, banks have created money for unproductive purposes, for asset transactions that play no role in GDP (i.e. real estate, stocks, lending to private equity funds and hedge funds).***

Therefore, asset bubbles form.

It is inevitable, as long as banks create new money for asset transactions, people will continue to chase the lucrative capital gains on offer in these asset classes.

This has a crucial impact on many people's lives.

Think about this: Private Equity giant Blackstone buys up real estate, financed by this credit creation at the banks.

Blackstone has a real estate portfolio of $325 billion, including over 300,000 residential units worldwide.

***Many people struggling with their rent would be angered to find that Blackstone has financed these mammoth deals via credit creation at the banks.***

Credit creation which could be used for productive purposes, but instead is used to move [Schwarzman yet further up the Forbes List](https://www.forbes.com/profile/stephen-schwarzman/#5fd655f7234a).

A List which ranks and celebrates humans based on net worth, regardless of their contribution to the technological advancement of the human race (and omits those with true power and obscene wealth).

So if banks are creating credit for asset transactions, then you will have asset bubbles, banking crises and soaring wealth inequality.

The Banks are under NO obligation from regulators to create credit for productive purposes.

Create credit for business development, technological innovation, etc?

Nah, let's lend to Blackstone so they can increase their carry.

This is why there *is* some valid criticism for the Baby Boomer generation - they have traded the technological progression of the human race for an increase in their already significant carry.

If and when banks slow down credit creation for asset transactions, some speculators (i.e. those who've borrowed money to invest in financial instruments) go bankrupt.

Then, banks suddenly have nonperforming loans, so they become more risk averse, reducing lending as asset prices fall.

***This leads to more bankruptcies, and this vicious cycle then leads to a BANKING CRISIS.***

But if Trump won, investors would not only keep their money in the market but would buy more stocks. 

However I’m running into new information about Wall Street support for Biden/Harris. During the Vice Presidential debate Harris quoted Moody’s Analytics Wall Street firm, saying that the Biden/Harris ticket would create 7 million more jobs than trumps plan. This firm isn’t the best to have in your corner. People remember Moody’s Analytics with the subprime mortgage bonds, how they defrauded Americans and contributed to the financial scheme that led to the 2008 collapse.

I’m also hearing that it’s an open secret that Wall Street wants Biden/Harris to win. Goldman Sachs puts it out in bulletins to their investors that Biden/Harris will be good for stocks. Reporting in the NY TIMES say they were excited about Harris on the ticket because donors love her. Reporting in CNBC, Joe consulted with his Wall Street donors for who he should pick for his VP and they liked Kamala. 

Harris did well with Hampton fundraisers and has Silicon Valley ties. She was Attorney general of California during the crucial time the tech giants became behemoths/monopolies.

 \*  Broadway is closed until mid-2021  
 \*  6 West End venues THINK they can open right now.  
 \*  Cirque du Soleil went bankrupt and cut over 3500 jobs.  
 \*  Feld Entertainment (family tours - Disney on Ice, Monster Jam, circus, etc) has permanently fired 90% of their workforce.  
 \*  Live Nation and other concert promoters have laid off a majority of their employees.  
 \*  Talent agencies who plan & book concerts, appearances, festivals, etc have laid off over half their employees.  
 \*  Cruise boat artists are unemployed and amusement park productions have no idea when they will be rehired.  
  \*  There are no concerts, festivals, or tours scheduled until 2021 and  if they don't perform next year they are likely to go bankrupt & may  never happen again. No Jazz Festival, no Coachella, no Bonnaroo, no  EDC, no Glastonbury, no tours, no ballet, no opera.... it's all gone.  
 \*  It is predicted that 90% of independent music rooms could close if this continues.  
  \*  Artistic and musical organizations of all kinds - choirs, theaters,  orchestras, dance companies, festivals, music rooms, not to mention all  technical and independent suppliers - all are trying to find  alternatives to succeed in working.  
 \*  Over 12,000,000 people work  in entertainment production, we are not insignificant and this industry  can't reopen until mass gatherings are allowed.

t3_jbiu7p,Does capitalism really make sense?,"Imagine a small village of 100 people who decide to use capitalism. Except for the elderly and the children, the main healthy villagers will be fighting for resources, skills, and time. Overtime, someone or one family will end of on top of the pile. If you equate it to the current world status then this village will have one man and wife, with kids, who own all of the other villagers as their slaves, own most of the resources as their own, and maintain an unsustainable lifestyle.

The economist try to sell us on this big scale idea of capitalism, when in reality, it is no different then this illustration. Capitalism has created utter devastation in most of the ""village"". People are starving and dying. Most of the village has lack of education and resource necessities. And the means in which the village is producing endless amounts of unnecessary products is damaging local environments and ecosystems.

t3_jdbpx4,Three Theories of Banking,"There are three main theories of banking.

But what are they?

And, more importantly, which one is correct?

&#x200B;

**1 - FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION THEORY**

First of all, we have the Financial Intermediation Theory.

***This is currently the dominant theory of banking, and states that banks are just financial intermediaries (i.e. they gather deposits and lend these out).***

OK, pretty basic, makes sense.

It can, and does, however have significant implications.

For example, the Financial Intermediation Theory has had a significant influence on economic policy in the post-war era, specifically the attitude that developing countries could be helped by international banks who could provide missing domestic savings through their lending in order to fund economic growth.

This has resulted in a *massive* increase in foreign borrowing and indebtedness by developing countries since the second world war. As planned of course.

&#x200B;

**2 - FRACTIONAL RESERVE THEORY**

Next up we have the Fractional Reserve Theory.

This was the dominant theory from around the 1920s to the 1960s.

***It also argues that banks are financial intermediaries, but collectively the banking system creates money via the process of 'multiple deposit expansion'.***

OK, what does this mean?

Well, it is based on the following idea:

With a reserve of, say 10%, every bank would lend 90% of any deposit, which would increase deposits with other banks, resulting in a multiple creation of deposits in the banking system. 

So the Fractional Reserve Theory states that banks create money collectively, but *not* individually.

According to the American economist Joseph Stiglitz, 

""Deposits increase by a factor of 1/reserve requirement.""

OK, [well at least we know that theory is wrong](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm)...

&#x200B;

**3 - CREDIT CREATION THEORY**

Finally, we get to Credit Creation Theory.

This was dominant until around the 1920s, and it is at odds with the other two theories by representing banks not as financial intermediaries - neither in aggregate nor individually.

***Instead, each bank is said to create credit and therefore create money out of nothing whenever it loans money or purchases assets.***

This means that banks do *not* need to first gather deposits or reserves to lend money.

According to the Scottish Economist Henry Dunning Macleod:

""Bankers, no doubt, do collect sums from a vast number of persons, but the peculiar essence of their business is, not to lend that money to other persons, but on the basis of this bullion to create a vast superstructure of Credit; to multiply their promises to pay many times: these Credits being payable on demand and performing all the functions of an equal amount of cash. 

...the business of banking is not to lend money, but to create Credit""

So the Credit Creation theory differs from the Fractional Reserve Theory, as one bank *is able* to create deposits.

Now you would expect many empirical tests of these theories, to see which one is correct? Right?

Well, no.

From the mid-19th century until 2014, there were no scientific empirical tests on this issue.

The first empirical test was [published in 2014 by Richard Werner](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070).

Only the credit creation theory was consistent with the observed accounting records.

Surprisingly, the Credit Creation Theory does *not* feature in most contemporary economics, finance or banking textbooks.

Think about this:

Since roughly the 1920s, there has been a movement from the accurate credit creation theory to the misleading, inconsistent and incorrect fractional reserve theory to today's dominant, yet completely implausible and blatantly wrong financial intermediation theory.

And this is why Economics is NOT a science. 

Fields such as physics and mathematics have high standards for rational truth for obvious reasons, a mathematical proof is a mathematical proof, a theory that matches with experiment repeatedly is a theory that matches with experiment repeatedly (i.e. these fields strip away human emotion and present cold, rational truth).

The Field of Economics on the other hand has been corrupted, providing the *propaganda* for the Banking Cartel.

The interesting thing...is that the Banking Cartel, and when I say banks I am referring commercial banks here, [are under attack from another Cartel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4sOWJDDZsI).

A Cartel set to become more powerful than ever before...

The Central Banking Cartel.

Mortgages are very often securitized, which means that the bank sold the mortgage to a third party, which buys and bundles up thousands of individual mortgages into a big bundle, and sells slices of that bundle to indie investors.

t3_ji2n4v,Question on Inflation and Minimum Wage (US),"First things first, this post isn’t to spark a debate among political parties, but to gauge the effect of what it would do to economy in a whole. 

I know there have been talks on raising the minimum wage for many years now, and it appears it’s more on the horizon now than it ever has been.

For example purposes let’s say the minimum wage is $7.00/hour, and the proposed increase is $15.00/hour. Let’s say this increase passed and is now the normal across the board. All employees who receive minimum wage are now making $15.00/hour. In a perfect world, not a single employee will lose their job, but this simply isn’t the case and is unrealistic. Let’s pretend no one lost their job, and life continues as normal for this bracket. 

As all minimum wage employees are now making double their previous salaries the question remains for all of the employees who didn’t make minimum wage but were within the wage gap such as the $10.00/hour, the $12.00 hour, the $15.00/hour, etc. Would all of these wages be boosted to a new monetary value to suffice for the new gap that was created? 

Employers who would normally pay their employees $14.00/hour for certain trade skills, manufacturing jobs, or collegiate roles are now all of a sudden struggling to compete with the fast food industry or mall retail to maintain a workforce as these roles require less work for more pay. An employee before the minimum wage increase making $14.00/hour would in theory require their salary to be increased to $22.00/hour to suffice for inflation and the recent $8.00 increase to minimum wage. This would then create a trickle up effect for every other job on the market as employees demand wages to fit their work. 

After all is said and done, we’re right back at square one, but with higher inflation.

t3_ji0how,How to profit off Global Warming: HVAC Market Research with Due Dilligence on 5 Air-Conditioner brands.,"# If you find this interesting please follow my account for more DD.

# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!

**Introduction**

With the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. 

**Finding our compatible companies.** 

I only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) 

1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)

2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). 

3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). 

4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). 

5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)

**Understanding the HVAC market.**

Before we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.

Some facts: 

1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. 

2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. 

3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).

4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.

5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).

6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.

As can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.

\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.

\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.

\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.

\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.

\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.

\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.

**Market share.**

This was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:

\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.

\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.

\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.

\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.

\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%

My conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.

**Conclusion**

First of all, I should start with saying that Lennox really shouldn’t have been included, they are on a completely different level than these 4 other companies. Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.

Looking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:

\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.

\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.

\- Daikin spends the most on R&D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.

\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.

\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.

\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise

\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.

\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. 

\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio

\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.

\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M

Now on to the less financial aspect of the data.

I really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.

To conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",3,0.71,1603657670.0

The Trump administration has been trying to thwart that progress. In May last year, it banned US firms from selling electronic components to Chinese IT Giant Huawei without government approval. Huawei has been a driving force behind 5G and holds the largest global market share in 5G base stations.

In May this year, the US got even tougher, declaring that no manufacturer anywhere in the world could sell semiconductors to Huawei if they were using US-made manufacturing equipment.

But the rise in geographic mobility points to an expected increase in economic efficiency for businesses — and the individual. “Remote work presents a potential solution for those seeking job opportunities that don’t want to pay the high housing costs of a major city,” Ozimek points out. “As our survey shows, many people see remote work as an opportunity to relocate to where they want and where they can afford to live. This is an early indicator of the much larger impacts that remote work could have in increasing economic efficiency and spreading opportunity.”
From the employer’s side, there are key long-term benefits too, Ozimek says. “In the remote world organizations can find talented workers wherever they live; and this opens up opportunity for companies to build a well-skilled workforce.”",3,1.0,1604098301.0

t3_jm1vbv,Why did the agriculture's terms of trade fall during the US Great Depression? The best paper on the Internet.,"  

The farmers were bound by contracts with the landlords. Typically they had to pay a fixed amount for seven years regardless of their profits. That was essentially a feudal relationship - not for a capitalist profit but a direct share. Therefore there was no place for a capitalist crisis there. Furthermore two assisting factors. Firstly, the farmers were less dependent on market consumption than the urban workers, they could consume more out of their direct production. Secondly, the unemployment in the cities forced them to stay in the rural economy. 

The cause of major capitalist crises the fall of the rate of profit resulted in the decrease of the industrial output that multiplied to the entire non rural economy causing a drop by one third. 

The crucial point is that this increased the non rural value relatively to agriculture. As explained in the beginning as opposed to the industrial capitalists the farmers had to keep paying the rent. Precisely those factors forced a deflation of agricultural output by 33% in real terms. Here we find the deterioration of agricultural terms of trade.

A general deflation could not solve the problem because it would merely restore the lack of demand at a lower level of prices. Also, in the industrial and service sectors there was nothing to force the supply to increase. Anyway since the level of investments dropped six times the real wages would have to fall six Times what is impossible. 

Others have tried but only I found the answer.

t3_jnujms,The Bank of Japan Cartel,"Japan's post-war economy is the stuff of legend.

Indeed, it is even referred to as Japan's 'economic miracle'.

But how did they do it?

&#x200B;

Well, they had a war-economy system, adapted to the production of consumer goods. 

Cartels controlled competition within Japan, but of course there was no such arrangement internationally and Japanese companies soon became dominant in many markets in the world.

The Japanese established a trade surplus with almost all of its trading partners, most prominently with the United States and the European Union.

***During the 1980s, there was even talk about Japan's economy someday overtaking that of the United States.***

Some compare it to the current situation between the United States and China - the difference being that Japan is effectively a US puppet due to military leverage, which is not the case with China. 

&#x200B;

The Ministry of Finance were the top dogs in Japan's post-war economy.

They controlled most aspects of the economy.

The Bank of Japan, Japan's Central Bank, had to report to the Ministry of Finance.

***However, the quantity of credit creation and its allocation was decided by the Bank of Japan.***

Via a process known as window guidance, the Bank of Japan was able to dictate to whom and for what banks could issue loans.

Essentially, the Bank of Japan told the Commercial Banks how much they will have to lend in the coming quarter and which sectors they would have to lend to.

Whenever the Ministry of Finance would inquire about the Bank of Japan's Window Guidance policy, Bank of Japan staff would engage in complex discussions, full of technical jargon - to make the process seem impenetrable to non experts. 

&#x200B;

Of course, Central Banks such as the Bank of Japan like to have full independence and establish absolute power. 

So how did they do it?

Well, they needed to create a bubble, which would then lead to a crisis, which would then lead to the power grab.

The Bank of Japan began to significantly increase window guidance loan quotas, average yearly loan growth quotas were close to 15% in the late 1980s.

***Essentially, they forced the commercial banks to engage in ridiculous levels of credit creation.***

This caused a boom in the stock market, and in real estate.

Between 1985 and 1989, stocks rose around 240% and land prices rose 245%.

Although Japan is 26 times smaller than the United States, its land was valued at 4 times that of the United States.

Therefore, instead of being used to limit and direct credit appropriately, Window Guidance was used to create a giant bubble.

The Bank of Japan was well aware that the only way for banks to meet their loan quotas, was to expand non-productive lending and therefore these asset bubbles in stocks and real estate formed.

&#x200B;

OK, so we have a bubble. 

Time to pop it.

Yasushi Mieno, in his first press conference as the 26th Governor of the Bank of Japan in 1989, said that

***""Since the previous policy of monetary easing had caused the land price rise problems, real estate related lending would now be restricted.""***

Well, the press lauded him - fighting against this silly monetary policy.

In fact, *he* was Deputy Governor during the bubble era, and *he* was in charge of creating the bubble!

Starting just a week after his appointment, from late December 1989 until August 1990, the Bank of Japan *heavily* increased interest rates. 

Soon...the Japanese asset price bubble of the 1980s...popped.

Bankruptcies galore.

Between 1990 and 2003, the stock market fell by around 80% and land prices in the major cities fell by up to 84%.

Of course, mainstream economists were relieved - the downturn demonstrates that Japan's economic system was not so successful after all.

Thou shalt embrace neoliberalism.

According to Mieno:

***""Thanks to this recession, everyone is becoming aware of the need to implement economic transformation.""***

By the way, and this is important and very often overlooked, after his five-year term ended in 1994, Mieno became a Director at the BIS, the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank for central banks...

&#x200B;

In order to end the recession and improve performance, it was claimed that Japan must shift from welfare capitalism back to shareholder capitalism.

Of course Japan, a country that had run a consistent and significant trade surplus, needed to change its economic system to become more competitive...

It certainly has worked a treat - check out Japan's debt to GDP ratio since the asset bubble popped around 1990.

Oh, there's more...

***Soon after his post ended in 1994, Mieno embarked on a campaign, giving speeches blaming the Ministry of Finance for the creation of the bubble and the long recession.***

He lobbied for a change in the Bank of Japan law.

He suggested that it was the Ministry of Finance who had pushed the Bank of Japan into the wrong policies and, of course, to avoid such problems in the future, the Bank of Japan needed to be given full legal independence.

***In 1998, monetary policy was put entirely into the hands of the newly independent Bank of Japan.***

t3_jpo3cj,The Petrodollar Era - What is the Endgame?,"After World War II, a new international monetary system called Bretton Woods was created.

Bretton Woods established three main things:

(1) the U.S. dollar was to be an international reserve currency, 

(2) the U.S. dollar would be backed by gold at a price of $35 per ounce, and 

(3) any country could exchange dollars for gold.

&#x200B;

Countries running trade surpluses with the US sought to exchange their dollars for gold, and this rapidly shrunk US gold reserves. 

This then led to the so called Nixon shock - President Richard Nixon effectively ending the Bretton Woods system in 1971.

The world economy entered a new era: the US Dollar became the global reserve currency.

&#x200B;

The US made no effort to rein in deficit spending, in fact quite the opposite.

Therefore, the US needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt (i.e. to find buyers of US Treasury Securities) *without* driving up interest rates.

That is, the US needed more buyers for its debt.

But by 1974, the enormous flood of dollars from the US into top-oil-exporter Saudi Arabia suggested a solution.

That year, Nixon sent new US Treasury secretary William Simon to Saudi Arabia with a mission...

The task: neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon against the US and find a way to persuade a relatively hostile kingdom to finance America's widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth.

&#x200B;

The basic framework was simple: the US would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment.

In return, the Saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into US Treasuries and therefore finance America's spending.

A win-win: the Saudis would receive protection from geopolitical enemies, and the US would get a new place to unload large amounts of government debt.

This became known as ""petrodollar recycling"".

By *spending* on oil, the US was creating new demand for US debt and US dollars.

&#x200B;

Moreover, since Saudi Arabia dominated the OPEC - the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - this dollar deal was extended to OPEC overall, which meant that the dollar became the preferred currency for oil purchases worldwide.

And so the petrodollar era began.

This petrodollar system has had *massive* implications for US foreign policy, which has essentially involved imposing 'freedom' on any major oil-exporting state that moves towards ending its reliance on dollars.

&#x200B;

In 2000, Saddam Hussein, then-president of Iraq, announced that Iraq was moving to sell its oil in Euros instead of dollars.

Following a particular catalyst event in 2001, the US invaded Iraq, deposed Saddam Hussein, and converted Iraqi oil sales back to the US dollar.

Of course, this exact pattern was repeated with Gaddafi when he attempted to create a unified African currency backed by Libyan gold reserves to sell African oil.

Shortly after his announcement, rebels armed by the US Government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime.

After his death, the idea that African oil would be sold on something other than the dollar quickly died out.

Other regimes that have called for abandoning the petrodollar include Iran and Venezuela. 

The US has called for regime change in both of these countries...

&#x200B;

Although they have tried to keep it under wraps, Saudi Arabia is believed to be one of America's largest foreign creditors.

Undoubtedly, Saudi holdings of US debt and other assets are significant.

All else being equal, the US should be growing less dependent on foreign holders of debt, certainly in terms of Saudi and OPEC-held debt, since the global role of OPEC and the Saudis has been diminishing in terms of global market share.

But all else *isn't* equal, and the US has been piling on ever-larger amounts of debt in recent years. 

In 2019, for example, the annual deficit topped *one trillion*. 

&#x200B;

This immense growth in debt obviously makes the US regime more sensitive to changes in demand for US debt, and ever more reliant on foreign demand for both US debt and US dollars. 

In order to avoid a crisis, the US must ensure that interest rates remain low and that foreigners want to acquire both US dollars and US debt.

&#x200B;

Were petrodollars and petrodollar recycling to disappear, it would have a twofold effect on US government finances: 

First of all, a sizable decline in petrodollar recycling would put significant *upward* pressure on interest rates. 

The result would be a budget crisis for the US government, as it would have to devote ever-larger amounts of the federal budget to payments on the debt. 

(The other option would be to have the US central bank monetize the debt by purchasing ever-larger amounts of it to make up for a lack of foreign demand. But this would lead to growing price inflation.)

Furthermore, if participants began to exit the petrodollar system (and, say, sell oil in euros instead) demand for dollars would drop, exacerbating any scenarios in which the central bank is monetizing the debt.  

This would also generally contribute to greater price inflation, as fewer dollars will be sucked out of the US by foreign holders.

The result could be ongoing declines in government spending on services, and growing price inflation. 

The US regime's ability to finance its debt would decline significantly, and the US would need to pull back on military commitments, pensions, and more. 

Either that, or keep spending at the same rate and face an inflationary spiral.

&#x200B;

Or...how about another option?

Anyone fancy a Great Reset?

In states where recounts haven’t been enacted automatically, the political campaign requesting the recount covers its cost, and the money is refunded if the results overturn the election’s outcome.

t3_jv49wt,Have you heard of the Bank for International Settlements?,"The Bank for International Settlements (the BIS).

***Possibly the most powerful bank that most people haven't heard of.***

Known as the central bank for central banks.

The BIS was set up in Basel, Switzerland, in 1930 to facilitate World War I reparations payments from Germany.

It was partly the brainchild of Montagu Norman, the Depression-era Governor of the Bank of England.

Norman, or rather those he was representing, wanted a new bank that would serve as the world’s first *international* financial institution.

A meeting place for central bankers. 

Away from the demands of politicians and the prying eyes of nosy journalists, the bankers would bring some much needed order and coordination to the world financial system.

Norman’s proposal gained an eager advocate in Hjalmar Schacht, the Reichsbank president.

The Reichsbank was the Central Bank of the German Reich at the time.

Schacht saw the BIS as a way of easing Germany’s reparations burden, but it became far more than that:

***The BIS helped to sell gold seized by the Nazis from occupied nations and acted as a conduit of hard currency that allowed the Third Reich to buy raw materials throughout the war - to the point where Emil Puhl, the Reichsbank Vice President, described the BIS as the ""only real foreign branch"" of the Reichsbank.***

&#x200B;

The BIS's morally tainted wartime experience almost sank it at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, when Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau and lead American delegate to the conference Harry Dexter White sought to liquidate it while setting up the postwar international system dominated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

However, the BIS's powerful friends intervened to save it.

Since then the BIS has continually reinvented itself, using the Bank as a place to host a lot of the new architecture of the financial system, specifically the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

&#x200B;

[The Petrodollar Era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU) has had a massive impact on foreign policy.

It was the CIA who imported a new leader for the so called ""people's rebellion"" in Libya. 

Indeed, Khalifa Hafter had spent the past 20 years living with no known source of income just five miles away from the CIA's headquarters in Langley.

&#x200B;

Cheney expressed great concern in a speech in 1999 that foreign governments were controlling oil.

***""While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities, the Middle East, with two thirds of the world's oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies.""***

&#x200B;

Former Supreme Allied Commander Europe of Nato, from 1997 to 2000, Wesley Clark claims that in 2001, a general in the Pentagon showed him a piece of paper and said:

***""I just got this memo today or yesterday from the office of the secretary of defence upstairs. It's a, it's a five-year plan. We're going to take down seven countries in five years. We're going to start with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, then Libya, Somalia, Sudan, we're going to come back and get Iran in five years.""***

&#x200B;

This agenda fitted perfectly with the famous think-tank called the Project for the New American Century.

So how is this all relevant to the BIS?

Well, the Libyan government controlled more of its oil than any other nation on earth and it is the type of oil that Europe finds easiest to refine - OK that seems like incentive enough to impose democracy - but there's more:

Libya also controlled its own finances.

***For the seven countries named by Clark, what did they have in common? None of them were listed among the member banks of the BIS, putting them outside the long regulatory arm of the central banker's central bank in Switzerland.***

&#x200B;

What about today?

Well, naturally, the BIS is preaching about the importance of Central bank Independence.

As well as this, they have a new innovation hub, incorporating research into Central Bank Digital Currencies.

The BIS continues to operate with less disclosure than the central banks that make up its executive committee. 

Its assets are protected against seizure. 

Its process of establishing capital requirements for banks remains...opaque.

MMT economists deal with the idea that **more inflation reduces unemployment**, this is what Phillips curve explain.

Nowadays Phillips curve version include the possibility of negative inflation (deflation) when high unemployment, but the purpose is the same.

* As Powell said, FED is going to maintain inflation slightly above 2% seeking inflation that averages 2% over time to reduce unemployment. To achieve it, monetary policies like zero interest rates and no bank reserve requirement has been implemented. But as far as I know inflation is not reaching the streets yet, provably because to reach the main street the FED needs commercial banks or states intervention to ease direct cash.

Conclusion: This leads to the CBDC (central bank digital currency) as medium of citizens direct control of broad money.

&#x200B;

* In any case, credit expansion to corporations doesn't equals solid growth as bail outs aren't necessarily helping a prosperous business, but sustaining a project with no demand and perpetual debt. Looks like inflation just reached financial markets making them volatile, unpredictable and a signal to wrongly invest capital as the continuous bail outs distorts the fundamentals.

Conclusion: Inflation just looks like a fake demand that distorts reality, reducing unemployment does not mean a trust full economic growth as bail outs comes in the economy, instead looks like a downward spiral of debt that keeps non profitable companies alive.

I have hope in the Bitcoin adoption to start building a free market decentralized alternative.

I really don't want to extent the content, as short reads are good for discussion and this is my resumed point of view.

Just to remind that this is the end of a long-term debt cycle, interest rates should rise up guiding a healthy deflationary process where the free market leave behind indebted corporate's that couldn't find their place in a democratic demand.

Instead QE insanity is recapitalizing bank reserves, leading to a new artificial period of credit expansion. This does not represent free market capitalist society where citizens choose which products are needed by purchasing them incentivizing it's production, thriving the business by demand.

Centralized bail outs seem to be the new reality and looks like the new standard before, during and provably after this COVID crises.

Vote results:

The Investopedia definition is pretty accurate: 70%

The stock market: 6.4%

Just the US stock market: 1.4%

Just hard economic data: 9.3%

Politics has nothing to do with the economy: 8.6%

If I agree with the political slant, then it's about the economy. Otherwise it's spam: 4.3%

------------------------------------------------------
Here is [Investopedia's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp) definition of 'the economy'.

&#x200B;

\> **An economy encompasses all activity related to production, consumption, and trade of goods and services in an area. These decisions are made through some combination of market transactions and collective or hierarchical decision making. Everyone from individuals to entities such as families, corporations, and governments participate in this process. The economy of a particular region or country is governed by its culture, laws, history, and geography, among other factors, and it evolves due to the choices and actions of the participants. For this reason, no two economies are identical.** 

That's a partial definition. Investopedia goes on to explain in more detail, but it is still merely a basic and simplified definition. Generally, the idea is, the economy is an expansive topic covering a wide variety of activities undertaken by consumers, governments, corporations, and other players in society. It also encompasses the means of production and resources.

There have been a number of complaints from users who feel they have a better definition of 'the economy' than Investopedia. However they never explain what their definition is. They just make wild accusations and report material they don't like for whatever reason as ""not about the economy"".

Let's suppose early next year the vaccine is available. Somehow, we have mass produced 100 million doses by March 1, and everybody runs out to get vaccinated. Sunshine and rainbows follow. People rush out to celebrate. People have been stuck in their houses for months, keeping their distance from each other. They pile into bars, restaurants, and movie theaters. They go to Disney world in droves. They pry open their credit cards and binge on ten dollar lattes. They celebrate like there's no tommorow. 

Suppose the celebration lasts for six months. It's September 2021. People are sitting in their living rooms, looking over their credit card bills, and taking a look at their finances. As they wake from the hang over, they finally realize they need to curb the over indulgance. People stop spending so much. Business activity slows. Sales at companies declines. The u.s. enters a natural slowdown and recession.

The problem is, many companies have spent the last twelve years ramping up their debt and moving further out on the risk curve. So, what would be a normal moderate recession becomes large. Debt amplifies returns. It also amplifies losses. With so much debt in the system, companies will be faced with so much losses. And, if consumers finally realize they need to change their life styles after waking up from the hangover and become more frugal, those corporate losses will persist.

Most of the gains from investing and business activity in the past twelve years have come from debt. Well, once that debt begins to unwind, the losses will amplify. At the same time that consumers are changing their spending habits, businesses will be forced to realize losses and start paying down debt. This unwinding of the debt will continue untill all the gains of the past twelve years are erased.

Think of it this way. Most of the financial gains of the last twelve years have come from debt. When the debt is given back, the gains must also be given back. The gains are quite literally dependent on the debt. Without the debt, the gains do not exist.

Wage inequality is getting worse, according to new data from the Social Security Administration, which shows a steady trickle-up effect in worker income during every period for the last four decades.


That’s happening as wages for the bottom 90% of earners are being “continuously redistributed upward” to the top 10% and often even further to the top 1% and 0.1%, reports the Economic Policy Institute, which analyzed the data. Their findings? Since the year 1979, while wages for the bottom 90% saw a modest growth of 26%, wages for the top 10% grew between 51.8% to 75.1%.

But more eye-poppingly, the top 1% of earners are now paid 160.3% more than they were back then, and the tippy-top 0.1% bring home a whopping 345.2% more. That gives today’s bourgeoisie six times, and 13 times the growth of wages for the proletariat masses, respectively.

This gradual widening of the wage gap has persisted throughout every major period, including the most recent decade from 2009 to 2019. During that time, which also included the economic recovery after 2008’s Great Recession, wages for the bottom 90% rose 8.7% while wages for the top 1% and 0.1% soared 20.4% and 30.3% respectively.

At the same time, the collective wealth of U.S. billionaires has now grown by $1 trillion since the pandemic began. That’s enough, a new report says, to cover sending a $3,000 check to all 330 million-plus Americans, while leaving the billionaires wealthier than they were before the pandemic.


“If I were Congress, I would pass it immediate surtax or levy on billionaires,” says Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, one of the groups that authored the report, which outlines how much the richest Americans have increased wealth during the pandemic. “I might even go lower than that, but I certainly start with billionaires, and call it the emergency pandemic wealth tax. Just lop it right off the top of these folks, and use that money for pandemic relief.”

Between the first lockdown in March and early December, Jeff Bezos’ wealth grew from $113 billion to $184 billion. Elon Musk’s wealth grew nearly five times larger, from $24.6 billion on March 18 to $143 billion on December 7. Mark Zuckerberg’s wealth grew from $54.7 billion to $105 billion. Dan Gilbert, the head of Quicken Loans, saw his wealth grow from $6.5 billion to $41.8 billion. In total, the 651 American billionaires saw their net worth grow from $2.95 trillion in March to $4.1 trillion in December.

t3_kdzdj5,It’s an economic war’— Warren Buffett urges Congress to extend relief for small businesses,"Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett urged Congress on Tuesday to extend aid to small businesses as they continue to struggle through economic shutdowns used to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

“It’s an economic war,” Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick on “Squawk Box” in a telephone interview, speaking alongside Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon about helping small businesses.

Specifically, Buffett asked lawmakers to extend the Paycheck Protection Program.

“I think the country owes it to the millions of small-business people … just renew the PPP and get us to the end of the tunnel,” Buffett said. “When we went into World War II, a lot of industries were shut down; everything went to the defense production. Well, we’ve shut down a lot of people in this particular induced recession and others are prospering, and I think the country owes it to the really million of business people.
The window to apply for PPP loans expired earlier this year even with funds remaining in the program. However, Congress has been in a stalemate for months in its negotiations for new government aid, putting pressure on businesses, particularly the smaller ones.

Late on Monday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers presented a $908 billion fiscal stimulus package. The proposal includes about $300 billion to support small businesses, including restaurants and entertainment venues.

Small businesses, especially restaurants, have struggled to stay afloat during the pandemic as social distancing restrictions force them to limit capacity. Some businesses have been forced to shut down temporarily — and permanently, in some cases — because of these limitations and a lack of stimulus.


Without additional aid for small businesses, Congress is “in the process of dashing the dreams of tens of thousands,” Buffett said. “Congress should act.”

“It would be so foolish to not follow through on this and enable those people to get back to where they could do the kind of business they were doing before,” Buffett added.",7,0.9,1608082334.0

t3_keqtnb,What do you think about the commoditization of water?,"[Australia’s Water is Vanishing](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-australia-drought-water-crisis/)

I believe the commoditization of water has to do more with the fact that people who work in industries which require the use of water (i.e. farmers) would like to hedge their costs. I’m going to stick with the example of farmers as it seems like the easiest one to explain: Often times people in those industries are hit with surprise prices and it really takes a toll on them financially when they require the use of water to grow crops. The reason other natural resources are commoditized at the moment is mainly to help people hedge their costs, making sure their financial and business planning for day-to-day operations remain stable. The reason water is being commoditized NOW is because of some things that happened in the Australian water market (read up on it if you’re interested) 

Of course, the intentions behind the commoditization of water are positive, but as we all know... speculators are the real cause for concern. I believe that this was the right move to help some industries “hedge”, but I definitely fear the “speculators” on Wall Street trying to make a quick buck off a trade. 

What does everyone else think? The commoditization of water definitely sounds a bit scary.",5,0.86,1608181306.0

t3_kfxdlw,The Crisis Housing Act would automatically activate housing vouchers for the poorest to spend on housing after hurricanes and wildfires—or if a state’s unemployment rate increases drastically.,"The Crisis Housing Act Program (CHAP), a new bill introduced this week by Senators Brian Schatz, of Hawaii, and Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, aims to put an end to the cycle of ineligibility and inaction by allowing the dispersal of emergency funds to be automatically triggered after major disasters. That would eliminate congressional stalling every time there’s a catastrophe, and also ensure the poorest qualify for financial assistance.
the main aim of this bill is to focus on disaster relief, it also has a second trigger—for unemployment. Specifically, resources would be triggered by a 0.5% increase in the six-month average of a state’s unemployment rate, relative to its low during the previous year (a metric known as the Sahm Rule, named for economist Claudia Sahm). That arm of the bill was influenced by the COVID-19 economic crisis, as unemployment has greatly exacerbated people’s inability to pay rent, and there’s currently a bipartisan bill under discussion that would extend the eviction moratorium for another month and set aside $25 million for rent relief.

But rent payment has been a problem for a long time: Even before the pandemic, 15% of U.S. households spent more than 50% of their income on rent. “We really want Congress to shift its focus to be thinking about systemic, long-term solutions that really get at the heart of these issues,” Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy for the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), says. Those measures would build a stronger safety net for future disasters and emergencies. In the long run, the bill would also be more resourceful, Saadian says, in preventing homelessness’s costly problems, like shelter, healthcare, and foster care. “It’s pretty inexpensive, in the scheme of things.”



“When disaster strikes, families shouldn’t be left without a home or stuck in limbo waiting for Congress to pass a disaster relief bill,” Senator Schatz said in a press release. “Too many people in our country are housing insecure, and this is a good first step to building a safety net to support them.”

When disasters hit, poorer people have to wait for weeks or months for Congress to enact federal funding so they can access aid. After 2018’s Hurricane Michael, the first Category 5 hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. in 26 years, Congress took eight months to approve funding. While CHAP would have to initially pass in Congress, it would then permanently allow the automatic authorization of resources in the event of a major disaster, without the need for congressional approval—making funds ready and available for the most in need.",5,1.0,1608337585.0

t3_kj43c8,A last-minute-trump-administration-rule-could-lower-restaurant-workers-wages-by-700-million-a-year,"Less than 30 days before Trump is due to leave office, his Labor Department has imposed a rule that may significantly affect the wages of restaurant workers. By one estimate, it may collectively cost tipped workers more than $700 million a year.

The new Tip Regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act rolls back the so-called 80/20 rule, which previously required that 80% of the time a worker who makes the tipped minimum wage (which is lower than the regular tipped minimum wage) spends should be dedicated to tipped work, principally interacting with customers. In a published press statement, the Labor Department’s wage and hour administrator, Cheryl Stanton, said the rule was instated partly because it “provides clarity and flexibility for employers.”

But cutting this protection for workers has the potential to severely limit a tipped workers’ wage, according to Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), who previously served as Obama’s chief economist in his Labor Department. In an EPI release, she said that this “immense loophole” for employers could cost $700 million in servers’ wages annually—and that’s a pre-COVID-19 figure, which stands to be higher now.

Due to in-house dining cutbacks during the pandemic, many tipped workers are serving less and doing other tasks such as assembling takeout orders. Natasha , a restaurant server in midtown Manhattan we spoke to (we have chosen to omit her last name and the restaurant’s name to ensure job safety) says she’s cooking, cleaning, and even doing electrical work. “I’d say the fact that I work primarily for tips is almost insulting,” she says. “I would say that my job right now is almost entirely non-tipped work.”

The new rule is vague about the amount of time servers would have to perform non-tipped duties, only calling for “reasonable” time.

The directive also allows employers to implement “tip sharing,” whereby gratuity earned by tipped workers, usually servers, can be distributed among non-tipped workers, such as dishwashers and cooks, who are often “excluded from participating in tip pools in the past,” Stanton said in the department’s release. This pooling of tips is already legal in many states and will be permitted only if servers make the standard minimum wage for food workers, which varies to a great degree by state and city. Still, it’s a way for employers to skirt raising wages for kitchen staff.

When asked about the reasons for implementing the rule and the criticisms, a Department of Labor spokesperson simply sent a list of FAQs on tips.

“The Trump administration opting, in its last 29 days and during a pandemic, to take more than $700 million out of the pockets of service workers is an emblematic parting blow from this administration to the working people of this country,” EPI’s Shierholz stated in the release. It’s also not the fullest extent of what the Trump administration aimed to do; as early as 2018, it wanted to allow tips to also be shared with managers and supervisors. It walked that back after a compromise was reached between Senator Patty Murray and then-Labor Secretary Alex Acosta.

But the directive won’t take effect for another two or so months—at which point the Biden administration could potentially delay it or replace it with its own preferred guidance.

t3_kir1hm,"After destroying its economy, Erdogan is indebting Turkey","  

In the last two and a half years, Turkey's economic situation has deteriorated sharply, and just when it was struggling to get back on track, after the recession following the currency crisis of the summer of 2018, the pandemic emergency, and the foreign military campaigns stopped its recovery. In the second quarter of 2020, in the months of the main production activities and international connections closure, the Turkish GDP contracted by 11% compared to the previous quarter, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a contraction in growth of 5% at the end of 2020.

To avoid the political and financial collapse, Erdogan took out a loan from the World Bank. That shows the inability of Erdogan and Turkey to secure even a very small amount. According to the World Bank, $300 million Rapid Support for Micro and Small Enterprises Project for Turkey, implemented by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization of Turkey (KOSGEB), will help people and firms by providing reimbursable support financing for manufacturing firms and other, innovative young firms focusing on manufacturing, scientific research and development, and computer programming. If Ankara presents Turkey as an industrial and rich country that lends Somalia and other nations, in reality, it appears to be unable to secure this amount.

It is clear that the policy adopted by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in recent years, namely that of stimulating growth through broad access to credit favored by low rates, has not only not worked but has been counterproductive. The unsuccessful attempt to support the lira over the past two years has cost Turkey 140 billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Also, for this reason, the management of former Finance Minister Beret Albayrak, who resigned after Erdogan replaced the governor of the Central Bank, become the target of criticism, not only from the opposition but also from within the ruling party. Among the most critical within the AKP, it seems that there was precisely Ağbal, his predecessor in the economy.

Erdogan is aware that the deterioration of the economy could cost dearly the political stability of his party. However, today the AKP, also due to the negative economic performance, is suffering from a decline in consensus and is suffering from internal divisions and several spills, such as that of former Finance Minister Ali Babacan, who last March founded the Democracy and Progress Party (Deva), and Ahmet Davutoglu, a former prime minister.

“The WB financing provided under the project will go to Micro and Small Enterprises in Turkey, which are the main source of employment for poor and near-poor households and account for more than 40 percent of employment in the manufacturing sector,” remarked Stefka Slavova, Lead Economist at the World Bank and co-Task Team leader of the project. But it will be impossible for Turkey to repay this debt in the short to medium term.

If international investors have seen the appointment of the new Governor of the Turkish Central Bank as a signal of a change of direction and a return to a more conventional monetary policy, and more independent of President Erdogan's bankruptcy line, it is probably just a measure that doesn’t go beyond the short-term objective of stabilizing exchange rates. As long as Erdogan remains at the helm of Turkey, his interests and the Muslim Brotherhood's expansionist ambitions in the region will continue to weigh on the state economy, effectively making it impossible to return even 50% of the amount provided by the World Bank.

One month after his appointment, the new governor of the Turkish central bank Naci Agbal has implemented a significant increase in the interest rate from 10.25% to 15%. A move that reverses the low-interest rate policy pursued by the monetary institution over the past year and a half to stimulate growth - as requested by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - but which nevertheless did nothing but accelerate the devaluation of the Turkish lira and increase inflation, which has reached almost 12%. In the immediate future, the central bank's decision resulted in an appreciation of 3% of the national currency, which from January to early November lost 30% of its value against the dollar.

t3_kjf0zk,"When valuing real estate use actual inflation, not expected inflation","I've seen debate over what future real estate growth might be. An article today claimed real estate is a good investment during times of inflation. My opinion is that's it's a bit more nuanced. In short, there is a difference between inflation and inflation expectations. When the two are the same, it does not make much difference. Inflation expectations is reflected in the price you pay for real estate. Actual inflation is reflected in the value growth of your real estate. 

In the early 1980s, inflation expectations were double digits, reflecting recent inflation rates of 10-15%. Over the following ten years actual inflation continually declined, and a lot of people who bought property in 1980 or 1981 got killed. They paid prices based on expectations, but their real estate growth reflected actual inflation.

Over the last thirty years, inflation and inflation expectations were very close. Not only did the difference not matter to people, but people also grew accustomed to ignoring the difference and became complacent to it.

I once heard a large real estate investor say many analysts like to type in 3% for rent growth across their pro formas. When he asks them why they used 3%, they say, ""I don't know. Do you think I should use something else?""

Over the next few years, I see inflation and inflation expectations running starkly different from each other.

I think a good approach to valuing real estate is to use actual future inflation, not current inflation expectations, and consider that the asking price make reflect expectations but not future reality. Of course, inflation is only one variable that contributes to value growth of real estate, but miss judging it can be distasterous. You must also consider other market variables too, such as population growth, jobs growth, types of jobs, and specific types of real estate people desire. Just be sure to accurately estimate future inflation and put it into value your ROI calculations, but don't expect the price to reflect it.",2,0.75,1608814686.0

t3_kkshnc,"Videogames are a bigger industry than movies and North American sports combined, thanks to the pandemic","
Videogames have grown to resemble competition-based, interactive movies, and the COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the industry to make more money than movies and North American sports combined.

Global videogame revenue is expected to surge 20% to $179.7 billion in 2020, according to IDC data, making the videogame industry a bigger moneymaker than the global movie and North American sports industries combined. The global film industry reached $100 billion in revenue for the first time in 2019, according to the Motion Picture Association, while PwC estimated North American sports would bring in more than $75 billion in 2020.

Both of those industries suffered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, while the videogame industry is expected to show double-digit growth this year following high-single-digit growth in the previous two years. Experts forecast that strong growth will continue in 2021, 
The videogame industry has boomed in recent years because of the variety of ways to play games. Gone are the days when all one had to track were console sales and games sold for their respective consoles and PCs. With the rise of digital-copy game sales, mobile games, in-app purchase freemium games, cross-platform games that aren’t limited to a specific console, streaming game services like Microsoft’s Game Pass, games-as-a-subscription models, and online distribution services like Steam, along with varying levels of transparency, anyone wanting to make apples-to-apples comparisons encounters an unwieldy fruit basket.

While console sales will get a boost from new versions, that’s not the biggest chunk of the industry, nor the fastest-growing. The biggest gain is expected to come from mobile gaming, with China playing a big role in smartphone and tablet gaming revenue, Ward said.
