This has caused ppl to turn to stocks - esp dividend paying stocks - to generate their income. The dividend income stocks have resulted in higher valuation over the last few years because of this - as investors, who normally paid 15 times earnings (P/E = 15) for a company's stock are now ready to pay 18, 20, 25 times earnings. So, in the hunt for yield, investors are ready to pay more for the initial stock price - thus driving up prices. This is especially true for bond-substitutes such as Utilities, REITs and MLPs. The increase in stock price of course means that the yield has fallen lower and lower on these stocks and will eventually return to balance once the interest rates rise and the investors return back to the safety of bonds.\n\nThe companies on the other hand - have seen some great growth in their earnings over the years, both as a combination of loose money and as the overall economy improves. In addition, companies can borrow money at record low rates and invest it for future growth. Unfortunately, most companies have now resorted to financial engineering - which is - they borrow money at the low rates available - but instead of investing for long term growth - they are just buying back their own stock (which is a way for management to reward themselves), trying to prop up the EPS numbers and looking for short term performance results. Once the gravy train ends, things should return back to normal.\n\nHope that helps", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1430930441.0, "tickers": []}

I suggest one of the brokers that uses IEX (I am going to shift to Interactive Brokers from TDAmeritrade later this year).  TDAmeritrade and most others that don’t use IEX receive fees from companies that execute their trades, in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  The only way they can do this is by making money off your transactions.  It’s just hidden and not charged by your broker, giving the illusion of “free.”  IEX brokers don’t do this.  That is transparency.  https://iextrading.com/trading/#members\n(Here’s a short into to IEX:  https://youtu.be/qGn_RgnRE5w. Traditional brokers hate IEX, as it poses a risk to their business models.)\n.\nThe next question is what kind of account to open.  If you are investing for future retirement, then the question comes to a traditional or Roth IRA.  Under a traditional IRA, you deduct your contributions from your current year taxes, but pay income tax on your contributions and growth upon withdrawal.  Under a Roth IRA, you don’t deduct your contributions and pay NO income tax on your contributions and growth upon withdrawal.  If you are indeed interested in growth over the long haul, I suggest a Roth as a general rule.  Both types of IRAs have contribution limits.  If you are interested in current income, then a taxable account is required (and has no contribution limit).\n.\nAs a source for what to invest in given the presumed focus on growth over time, I suggest the American Association of Individual Investors Dividend Investing portfolio.  Their portfolio is built around the proven idea that quality stocks that consistently pay a dividend go up in value faster over time than those that do not.  Their information is very educational in that you can deep dive into it as much or as little as you want.  That is, you can just choose which of the stocks in their portfolio appeal to you and buy them, or you can dig into their charts and explanations to better understand their rationale.  It’s a couple of hundred dollars a year.  The subscription also includes general membership, which includes opportunities to go to local events as well as AAII’s general investing info.  www.aiaa.com\n.\nIf you are looking for current dividend income, I suggest Kiplinger’s Investing for Income newsletter.  I’ve found it’s the best for me.  I don’t use all their picks and own some stocks they don’t list, but list and their info is the most helpful dividend income news I have found.\n.\nI do not recommend the Motley Fool’s dividend newsletter.  I used to get it, but found their analysis wasn’t rigorous enough for me.  The final straw came when a stock they had recommended for a long period of time (StoneMor Partners) slashed its dividend due to a cash shortage after months of MF saying it was safe.  Unanticipated cuts can happen, but it was MF’s reaction that made me drop MF.  I’ll sum up MF’s reaction as “StoneMor cutting their dividend is proof their management doesn’t understand business.”  Well, I took that as a reflection on MF recommending a company for so long that “doesn’t understand business.”  Fortunately, I hadn’t bought StoneMor, but nevertheless their reaction to StoneMor’s dividend cut in light of MF’s long running recommendation was enough to convince me that MF wasn’t rigorous enough in its analysis.\n.\nThere are other dividend newsletters I subscribed to through the years (as well as checking this sub for ideas), but I’ve found AAII’s to be the best for appreciation/long term growth and Kiplinger’s to be the best for income.\n.\nA couple of other thoughts:\nSome high yielders are foreign stocks.  This brings currency fluctuations into your account plus probably some foreign tax withholding (which, in most cases, washes out of your US income taxes).  One of my foreign stocks went from 10% withholding to (gulp) 35% withholding due to the host country tax laws.  That will wash out, but in the meantime it messes up my cash flow big time.  I’m shying away from foreign stocks for that reason.\n.\nBe aware that LPs (limited partnerships) and MLPs (master limited partnerships) can generate great cash flow (some of it tax deferred), but cannot be put in an IRA (without really complicated tax issues likely arising), will complicate your taxes by issuing a K-1 (a complex form that a tax accountant will probably charge you $100 for each that’s on your return, and good luck figuring out a K-1 if you don’t use a tax accountant), and will generate a future tax liability upon sale.  If you still want an LP or an MLP regardless, make sure it’s a large enough to generate enough income to offset the added cost of someone else doing your taxes.\n.\nNow is the best time to invest... always.  Anything else is “market timing” which doesn’t work.  Just put in the same amount of money over time and watch your portfolio grow in the long run.  Can the value of your stocks go down in the short run?  Yes, and they WILL.  The question is what you do about it.  That lowered value only becomes a “loss” when you sell the stock and lock in that lower sales price.\n.\nThe above said, if you are looking for dividend payers that will provide you with current income (i.e. generally the higher yielders) be aware that rising interest rates (such as we are facing now) tend to lower the value of these stocks.  If you are going for stocks such as those in AAII’s dividend portfolio, I wouldn’t worry too much about that.  But even Kiplinger’s is advising a bit of caution of late. \n.\nAgain, congrats on getting started.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to PM me.\nW360.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1538579493.0, "tickers": [["IEX", 3], ["MLP", 1]]}
{"submission_name": "t3_9k2tr3", "id": "e723tzh", "text": "I just started doing this and had the exact same thing you're asking going through my head before I started.  I'll give you what I did and hopefully it helps.  \nSo I started on Acorns back in March 2018.  Its a simple app that I link to my bank and it rounds up every purchase I make to the next dollar then invests the change into a portfolio I was directed to select.  They start by asking you what type of investor you are then pick the portfolio for you.  I was more safe so I guess it went to bonds/dividend type.  Its a type of thing where you set it and forget it, they do the work of researching stocks.  So after a month I invested my change and had around $100 in Acorns and saw my gains up $2.00.  I was curious why, I know stocks go up and down, so I looked and it said I gained $0.17 dividend and the rest were from stocks going up.  Its not much but for about $100 this was amazing for me. \n\nWhy tell you this?  Because this fueled my urge to find Robinhood.  I have always known of stock trading platforms cost money from all the commercials.  So I never really got into it because trading one stock and paying a $5 fee was outrageous to me.  How was I suppose to make money if the stock didn't go up $10.  Too rich for me as a beginner, so that's where Robinhood made me make the plunge.  Robinhood allows me to buy and sell stocks commission free, thats right NO FEE!  Unfortunately I did not use a friend referral when I started Robinhood, I didn't know.  But that was fine, what I didn't know didn't hurt me.  It was just one free stock that Robinhood chooses.  \n\nSo I started out with $500 and instantly threw it at big names like Apple, Facebook, Ford and some random thread said ORC.  I have gained 0.73 off Apple just a month after I started and was astonished!  Then this ORC thing that I had no idea about(dont just follow some random internet person's anonymous suggestion), paid a monthly dividend!  It was $0.08 but what the heck, FREE MONEY(not really free)!!!!  I was hooked!  I started doing some growth dividend stocks, REIT stocks, some things like TSLA/Facebook(not dividend), and just felt dividend stocks were my calling, probably because FB is still $10 less than when I bought it, I don't like being negative. Last month I got $2.03 and this month i'm getting $3.67 from dividends.  \n\nI don't have a long history of investing and i'm a beginner.  I hope my short story helps you. \nI highly suggest starting a Robinhood account, and if you want my friend link its  share.robinhood.com/jasonw2061   The link only give you and myself a free stock, I've gotten 2 so far and they were just around the $4 mark.  So don't get your hopes up with trying to land a berkshire or AMZN stock.  \n\nOnce you have your trading platform, Robinhood, TDameritrade, Fidelity, etc.. Google has shown me a lot of stock info, leading to nasdaq sites and learning sites.  Just get out there and learn.  Probably not the best suggestions but again, I hope it helps.  \n\n\n\n", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1538521455.0, "tickers": [["ORC", 1], ["FREE", 1], ["FB", 1], ["AMZN", 1], ["BRK-A", 1], ["%5EIXIC", 1]]}

That said, I do root for them and hope to see them grow, they are a minnow in a shark pond with their free trades for all model, my old broker TD Ameritrade wouldn't go to free, so I moved on. \n\n M1 has the other 80% of my portfolio, I use it for Roth IRA's (something Robinhood does not offer), and a taxable account. Like others have said, M1 has partial shares investing at no cost, with pies that can have pies, so you can basically build your own etf's with this kind of setup. it's beautiful. I would like to add that M1 is already a nice platform, and is maturing quickly, coming out with new improvements constantly. {rant} If the guys over at r/M1Finance read this, the only thing I would improve would be to add a checkbox to place holdings on a hold only (no buy status) or to let us be able to transfer into new pies without having to sell and then buy back the whole holding, just dropping to 1% does not mean it will not buy again if you are heavily diversified {/rant}. Seriously though, I wish M1 had come out 20 years ago, their partial shares / no fee investing is a game changer for investors, that's just my opinion though. \n\nUnfortunately, neither offer a proper DRIP on stocks where you can get the discounts a true drip program has. Both Robinhood and M1 have the dividends paid directly back to the account, it is then on you to choose to reinvest it as you see fit, buying shares in robinhood and/or M1. M1 has the benefit of being able to just use their auto-invest setting, which is available because of the partial shares investing approach they have.\n\nGood luck on your financial journey!

I look at their chart and for the last 18months it has not been above about $24.  So I would look to sell a $24 CC that would pay a couple percent.  So, I would sell the JUN19 - $24 for 0.70 cents.

First thing to note is that if you want financial independence through dividends you're going to want to go with stocks that increase their dividends. I know many people like high yielding stocks, but in the long term, stocks with lower yields that increase dividends by 5+% a year always win. It's compounding based off the DRIP and accelerating with the percentage increases. Let me give you an example.\n\nEX\\] If you bought Caterpillar (CAT) at $80 back in 2014 at the time the dividend was .6 a Q or $2.4 a year. That translated to a 3% Yield. Fast forward to today. CAT is at $1.03 a quarter or $4.12 a year which translates to a 5.15% yield.  IID is at 3.5% yield and hasn't increase their dividend. In fact the stock has been dropping over the last 5 years. Not a stock I would personally buy. Stocks that have good fundamentals and increase their dividend yearly usually go up in value as well, usually maintaining the same yield. Take Coca Cola (KO) for instance.\n\nAnyway, back to CAT- This means that if you invested 1M in 2014, you would've made 30K that year. Now, in the 2019-2020 year you would make 51.5k. And this is without considering the massive capital gain or re-invested dividends. This strategy, as long as you choose stocks wisely, stocks that consistently grow their dividends will always beat those that don't grow their dividend ( ceteris paribus ). \n\nThe fact that you're 20 means that you easily have 45+ years to invest before you retire. if you use the dividend growth + reinvestment strategy, you'll have more money that you'll know what to do with.

Those tend not to grow as fast.  For example, T yields around 6%, so it's a much better income stock than MSFT. Coincidentally, I purchased that in 2015 as well, at a cost of $35.13.

I don't use it, but I believe I've heard it can.\n\nOR, if you want something more complicated, then you can do what I did. I personally created my own Google spreadsheet to tell me, since I like playing around with my own portfolio spreadsheet. You can pull today's dividend dynamically from a website in Googlespreadsheets like this:\n\n=regexextract(index(ImportHtml(\"http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=\"&A1, \"table\", 11),7,2),\"/\\*\\[0-9.\\]+/\\*\") \n\nWhere A is the column where you store your tickers (so A1 is where you have something, like MSFT, A2 might be JNJ, etc).\n\nThen you have one column for your manual dividend (lets say D), and another column where it scrapes html to populate it automatically (lets say AL).\n\nWhen your manual dividend (column D) < automatic dividend (column AL), it means they raised your dividend, (so you can highlight your manual dividend's cell in green).\n\nWhen your manual dividend > automatic dividend, that means they cut your dividend so you can highlight your manual in red. \n\nSo, in column D you add these conditionals:\n\nCustom Formula =D1-AL1<0 then red color\n\nCustom Formula =D1-AL1 >0 then green color\n\n(in a range from 1 to however many rows of stocks you have)\n\nYou then seed column D with today's dividend manually.\n\nThen in the future, when column AL changes (since it is automatically updating the manual dividend based on when finviz updates the dividend of your stock), your entry in column D will be either red or green.  That means that you either had a dividend raised or lowered since you were last in it.\n\nThen you update your entry in D to be the same as the one in AL and it will clear the color back to no coloring, and then you are back to the initial state.\n\nSo, I find it really handy.  The other day I opened my spreadsheet and saw that I company of mine had increased its dividend (it was highlighted in green), and I was surprised (cause I normally stay on top of this stuff by following news and such).  So then I just change the dividend that was in green to be what the automatic one was, to both reset the color back t o none, and to reset the spreadsheet.\n\nIf you are totally new to google spreadsheets, I'd recommend either trying Seeking Alpha or you can watch a tutorial video I made to help teach the basics of how to create your own portfolio in google:\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ctgybm/how\\_to\\_create\\_a\\_simple\\_dividend\\_stock\\_portfolio/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ctgybm/how_to_create_a_simple_dividend_stock_portfolio/)", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1568915404.0, "tickers": [["D", 4], ["AL", 2], ["GOOG", 2]]}

But I have faith that they will be around in ten years and continue raising their dividend. Tech is an interesting sector and ibm is investing a lot into AI, quantum computing, and hybrid cloud. I look at Microsoft and they were flat for about 12 years, they just needed the right leader. With IBMs acquisition of red hat, I believe their old CEO will become the CEO of IBM and bring IBM to the next level similar to what Microsoft's CEO did for them. There are a lot of risks, but based on my analysis, the margin of safety is high with big blue.

{"submission_name": "t3_dre5gz", "id": "f6hpvr1", "text": "Unless you need a specific instrument, focus on total return for your financial situation. As with so many things in investing, many superficially similar investment vehicles are aligned to deal with different financial and tax situations. To your point, having a fair distribution of growth oriented stocks and pivoting more towards dividend stocks near retirement is a fair approach to consider.\n\nFrom my POV, a dividend focus is preferable if you are approaching a point where you want a predictable, growing cash stream which you can use for life expenses(aka retirement/money for widows and orphans). I would argue that dividend stocks tend to have more disciplined managements who are forced to think in terms of sustained, longer term performance, and boards of directors who don't see quite as much opportunity for reinvesting cash back into the business for growth, as opposed to reusing that money to invest elsewhere. The downside with dividends is the tax treatment on the payouts which tends to be at higher rates than cap gains for many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrowth companies tend to have greater opportunities/needs for internal reinvestment, and hence they plow funds back into themselves, rather than you reinvesting money from dividends which were taxed to buy the same stock. Until you sell, you don't have any taxable events. In theory, a person can also sell fractional portions of growth stocks to simulate dividends. In practice, the trouble is that you may need to free up cash with that asset at times when the stock is depressed, and the only way to do so is to sell from your position. If you need a fixed amount, you need to sell more at low prices.  This is especially likely to be a problem periodically if you want a steady stream of cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are currently focused on **asset accumulation**, the government is getting a slice of every dividend you are reinvesting from taxes. A **growth investor** gets favorable tax treatment with a stocks which reinvest in themselves- they would typically want to focus on the investment which is likely to give the best overall return. US Dividend stocks tend to slightly outperform in studies I've seen, but they also have to do a little better in relation to the friction of higher taxes - For most, a diversified mix of growth and dividend stocks is likely a good bet.\n\nIf you are approaching a point where you want to predictable cash flow, dividends and bonds can put out reasonably reliable streams. In that context, the value of predictability can outweigh the tax disadvantage, and be more compelling. Stock prices and the mood of folks on the stock market won't impact payouts.  Of course, dividends and interest can fail if the underlying entity is in trouble(Dividend rates are often highest on weak \"discounted\" companies which are under-performing, and conversely, strong companies often have low dividend yields relative to their popular high stock price). Investors in companies like \"old reliable\" GE learned this when their generous dividend was slashed.\n\nA big thing to keep in mind, optimality differs based on your account. If you have funds in a 401K or IRA, you're not getting taxed on income events like dividends at the time, so it can potentially be more advantageous to have investments like dividend stocks and bonds in such accounts, and growth oriented investments in regular brokerage (especially as you can deduct cap losses against cap gains).", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1572861387.0, "tickers": [["GE", 1]]}

In general, your returns are penalized due to dividends reinvested to taxes, especially if you are completely overlooking robust, healthy growth stocks, which don't pay dividends (yet), and adding risk by reducing the diversification of your portfolio.\n\nDo you need the cash flow dividends provide right now? If not, consider a diversified mix of high performing businesses across industries (regardless of dividend) as a more efficient/stable vehicle for consistent growth during your working years. Keep your eyes open to the performance of indexes covering different scales(e.g. small, mid and large cap) and financial structures(e.g. growth vs dividend), as what does well today, isn't identical to what will do well tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would argue, you want a portfolio which grows in a tax optimal manner, and can be restructured to more heavily emphasize steady cash flow (through dividends and bond interest) **as you approach retirement, when you need a stable income**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is the basis of my recommendation? I am a mixed investor who has been active since \\~2000. Over the last 10 years, 60% of my main brokerage account value has come from market value growth, 10% from dividends. My plan is to retire on predictable dividend cash flow (I'm at \\~24k/yr at this point), but you run a risk of kneecapping your portfolio growth if you over-pivot towards high yield, slow growth dividend stocks, to the exclusion of the broader market.\n\nI'm sure someone will pull out a chart referring to the out-performance of Dividend Aristocrats vs S&P 500 over the last 25 years, but an important point is that index was only created in 2006, long after those companies had already been kicking ass. For the last few years, Dividend Aristocrats are victims of their popularity, have been getting over-priced from a P/E standpoint, falling behind the S&P. No one can say with certainty what sectors are going to outperform.\n\nDividends are good, but at the end of the day, they are a tool for predictability and cash flow.  If you don't need those problems to be solved, you shouldn't restrict yourself to just dividend companies.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1573795288.0, "tickers": []}

Dividends are operate as a fixed amount of dollars and  cents, generally paid on a quarterly basis. The stock price doesn't drive dividends, the health of the business and its capital needs do. The price people are willing to pay for a stock does react to dividends.\n\n(Edited to address my earlier hand-waving inaccuracy) On the \"ex-dividend\" date where the recipients of dividends are recognized, the value of a stock generally goes down by an amount matching  the value of the dividend, as that value is gone from the share(and underlying business) and will be paid out to the recognized holders from the ex div date on the dividend pay date. For folks who prefer details around the process, a better explanation here:\nhttps://www.dividend.com/dividend-education/everything-investors-need-to-know-about-ex-dividend-dates/\n\n\n\nTo the question of how much you get paid, div yield % is a function of the dividend rate in dollars divided by stock price in dollars.\n\nIn percentage terms, if the stock goes down in price and dividend is steady, you can buy it cheaper, and have a higher yield relative to stock price.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1573841332.0, "tickers": []}

(These both pay out monthly)\n\nNow many people say to avoid HIGH YIELD ETFS, but watch out specifically for ones with a decreasing value not covered by dividend. Ie stock pays out 3 dollars a year but it's been losing 3 dollars each year in its own value.\n\nDHY is a bond stock that pays .019 cents but only costs $2.51-3.\n\nMopay stands for monthly paying. With your capital it is SEVERELY hard to find a good portfolio mix that would net you $200 or more.\n\n(Aim for 8 percent mopays to get the cashflow started, afterwards when you need to stabilize this portfolio work on going towards less risky investments and focus more on diversification after getting the cash flow)\n\nSPECIFICALLY REMEMBER THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO GET CASH FLOW.\n\nREITs are great for that, however there can be increased tax responsibility. But the goal of THIS IS CASHFLOW. So understand that starting with an account that may have more tax needs (costs) will likely net you more and at the very least get your portfolio going at which point you can invest later into other things.\n\nSo a couple of good mopays\n\nAPLE, SREIT, SDIV, HYLD (wouldn't recommend, it's a high yield etf - see above), DHY, and ORC (Outlook doesnt look good) \n\nThere is also AMERICAN HOTEL INCOME REIT\n\nMostly 150 ÷ $30000 (150 was gotten by dividing $30,000 by your wanted monthly ($200))  which equals out to wanting a minimum of a .0666% payout each month. (Btw when you X .0666 x 12 (months) you do need a minimum off an 8 percent gain per year. \n\nNow stocks change in value, you will have to monitor and make up for the amount of equity and cash available for your account - ie the goal is to maintain value along with maintaining and growing yourself.\n\nSo if you got $200x12 = $2400\nAnd you lose $400 to stock depreciation then you need to make sure that you're restocking this account and keeping it maintained.\n\n\nI'm 20, I work a shit job and I do this on the side.

I have a planned amount I invest every month, but I also invest any money left over from my paycheck that I budgeted but didn't use.

On top of that, every time I buy fractional shares and it rounds into another full share, I update that spreadsheet and re-calculate into that spreadsheet the amount I now make.

MORL doesn’t quote track indicative value since there are no new issuances (and may be one of the ETNs that UBS is redeeming soon if I’m not mistaken). MRRL is essentially the same but backed by one less legal entity (UBS Switzerland if I remember right). \n\nIn my opinion the biggest risk by far with these is interest rate risk. First REITs are susceptible to interest rate risk because most of their assets are backed by mortgages. Then on top of that, the actual ETN takes on leverage to achieve double the performance of the underlying index. So changes in interest rates can massively affect the value of these notes.\n\nThe dividends, as far as I can tell, are based on the dividends issued by the companies comprising  the underlying index.

I chose dividend investing because I make less than 30k a year and while I love my job as a cook, it's never going to afford me more than a very meager existence, especially in retirement. \n\nFor me, dividends are for the future. I plan to hold my shares until retirement or later. Unless they cut their dividends, in which case I will sell those positions and put the money somewhere else. Since I intend to use the money for late in life, I re-invest all my dividends to act as compounding interest. I chose to build my initial portfolio based on dividend aristocrats in my price range that I like to buy myself security and peace of mind during whenever the next recession happens. Most of these aristocrats do not have a lot of Dividend growth however and hardly beat just having a high-yield savings account. Once these positions are filled in my portfolio, I intend to invest in more \"growth\" dividend stocks that give me the opportunity to increase my yearly dividend yield to a more stock market appropriate level of 6-9%.\n\n It would be cool to make a bunch of money all at once on some growth play every few years, but I have a very anxious personality and would no doubt be very nervous about one wrong turn meaning my investments were worthless, and feeling like it's not worth anything to me unless I cash out. I much prefer the peace of mind of getting paid money every month/quarter as a reward for my investment in these companies, which in turn I can use to purchase more shares for free, while never having to cash out my original shares to have value from my investment. \n\nWithin 5 months of starting I have accumulated $200 worth of dividends I will earn every year, minimum...forever. By the end of this year I should be close to $350-400. I invest about $400-500 a month in the market, so by the end of this year, my dividends earned will be like if I got an extra month in the year to invest. Within the next 5-6 years I should be at the level of dividends that I'd get $250-300 a month, which is to me like having an extra \"free\" paycheck every month to buy stock with that the companies are paying me to buy. \n\nI don't read financial books and pretty much everyone thinks Warren Buffet is a God, so I won't bother recommending any.

But the dividend payments (your rent) has not changed.. which means you get a nice yield!\n\nA favorite out here is $MO (Altria). The stock price has been dumping down to $40.37. They still pay $3.36 a year in dividends..  $3.36 / $40.37 = 8.3% Annual Dividend Yield!!!!\n\nSo you paid $40.37 to get a check for $3.36 every year for life\\*\\*\\*. If the price of the stock goes down, pick some more up! the admission is cheaper now, for the same pay out.\n\n\\*\\*\\* MO is in a class called the Dividend Aristocrats (see the wikipedia link in the other post). MO has paid dividends for 25+ years without a miss, AND increased them every year!!!!!

Its showing that MO is increasing their rent payment to you! at least the dividend payments will beat out inflation!\n\nIs MO's dividend sustainable?\n\nQ4 2019, Earnings were $1.09 per share\n\nMO pays out $0.84 cents per share, per quarter.\n\nDividendPayOut Ratio = 84/109 = 77%  .. They say under 80% is good. Thats just back of the envelope calculations.\n\nSo for me at least, the last week has been a bloody garage sale! As prices dropped, the dividend yields go up! \n\n$XOM (Exxon Mobil) is also a Dividend Aristocrat - current 7.34% yields\n\n$T (AT&T) also an Aristocrat, is pulling 6% (ATT doesn't increase dividends very well)\n\nThe annual growth in dividends is actually quite interesting.\n\n$KO is pulling 3% dividend yields at buy in. Also an aristocrat, they will increase their dividends every year.. Well how many years before it hits 10%... based on their history, probably over 100 years.\n\nThere are other aristocrats that start at 1% dividend yields, but can reach 10% yields in about 10 years!!!!  10% dividend yields on an aristocrat!! well, thats quite nice!

You can Google a list of them, or there are also a million YouTube videos about them. Essentially it's a list of dividend paying companies considered safe because they have consistently paid out and increased their dividends for at least 25 years...some 50 years or longer (hence Kings.) Since they have paid out that long they are considered fairly safe beginner options. That and/or some dividend based ETF's are good places to start looking. \n\nMy two biggest pieces of advice would be 1. Make sure you understand the company and what it does before investing. If you can't figure out what exactly they do from their little profile blurb you should probably not invest in it. 2. Understand this method will not make you rich in any short amount of time. Dividend investing is a long, slow process that gets faster the longer you stick with it...but if you start looking at too many ways to speed it up you might get sucked into some \"yield traps\" of failing companies that have a high dividend trying to keep investors while losing money.

{"submission_name": "t3_fhcz8a", "id": "fkarkt3", "text": "MY thoughts with some additional equities:\n\nMMM, ADP, JNJ, PG are very good right now. Incredibly boring but nice long term investments.\n\nMMM is an absolute beast for profitability, yield and capital reinvestment. MorningStar FMV is $186 which represents almost 20% discount from yesterday’s close of $147 and pre market is showing another 3.5% drop. This is the one equity I own very few shares of but will be jumping on it in the next few days like a mob on electronics at Walmart during Black Friday. This is a fantastic deal going forward. I believe one of the best for buy/hold dividend reinvestment.\n\nJNJ and PG are fairly valued right now. They aren’t my top picks but if they drop 10% over the next week, they may be a buy for me.\n\nAFL and ABBV are also good picks. You need to watch AFL long term though due to changes in Japan over the next decade. ABBV is very good fundamentally, undervalued slightly with great ROI and capital reinvestment. The yield is very nice and sustainable.\n\nDIS is undervalued by about $30. This is a great long term stock. With the move into Disney+, they will be printing money BUT it won’t happen for sometime. Disney Parks are a very large revenue generator (as is the cruise line) and you will see drastic shortfalls in the next 2-3 quarters. It’s going to be rough for them the next year. It’s Disney though. That Mouse is probably the most well known rodent in the world and will continue to appeal for years and years to come. DIS is down over 7% in after market trading at $98ish. I believe it hit its 52 week low yesterday of $102. I’d say it’s a buy at this level but it will probably drop a bit more, maybe even into the high 80s in the coming week.\n\nT and VZ are always good. They are at a slight discount right now. You’ll see the dividend for many years. These are not growth stocks at all. In a year or so you will see the equity prices rise but don’t expect more than 2-4% gains per year. Dividend is very safe though.\n\nINTC, PFE and CSCO are discounted pretty nicely right now. You have to watch INTC and CSCO due to their sector. You’ll see nice dividends for years on these but INTC and CSCO probably won’t see bull market gains again for sometime.\n\nD, SO, ED are strong fairly valued regulated equities with 2-4% yearly revenue gains and very nice yields going forward. ED has been paying dividends for years and years. I like it due to their move into Solar electricity generation. They really aren’t discounted now but they are pretty much the most “guaranteed” dividend income generators out there due to their regulated nature. \n\nXOM. I’m on the fence on this one. Oil definitely is a dinosaur industry. It’s so freaking capital intensive and anything below $40 a barrel is starting to kill margins right now. If the barrel price stabilizes around $50 or goes above it, I think XOM is a decent deal for a 5 year hold. You’d have to revisit it after that though. The reason it might be good is due to China. They love oil and coal still and don’t care about using either resource. I hold XOM but it’s definitely more risky, so do your research on this one.\n\nNot great for the next year or maybe 2 years if we do get into a full blown bear market is JPM and WFC. Dividends are safe on these and they are both discounted. These will eek out market increases over the next few years in a bear market but, these are definitely buy and hold for the next decade if you can get them for a decent price. Only issue with JPM is if Dimon dies or leaves the company. That guy is a freaking rockstar and his departure will hit the stock for quite sometime. I just don’t like BAC btw. I won’t own it. The company’s past leaves little desire for me to hold it but that’s just me.\n\nIf you want to have a great yield for the next few years but also want to see your equity drop 20-30%, look into MO. It’s currently undervalued. You’d have to be able to stomach the fundamentals though. For me, I’d love to chase the yield on this but don’t think it’s a great long term value even at its current level. You have to be comfortable with their business and balance sheet if you wanted to invest. China and Europe still love to smoke so...I dunno on this one.\n\nLast but not least is APPL. Yes, it’s a growth/tech stock with a large supply network in China and its overvalued atm, but the fundamentals are there and are freaking fantastic. FMV is about $238-240. If it were to drop to or below that, it would be a buy even in a bear market. Long term, that’s a great company and even though the yield is low, you have small yield increases, large share buybacks and the largest cash hoard in the world.  The share buybacks are MASSIVE for the shareholders.\n\nOut of all of these, I’ll be scrambling for MMM and really looking at DIS and APPL at the right prices.\n\nEdit - Today and tomorrow will be an absolute bloodbath in the markets. Anticipate the DOW hitting 21700 or below by Friday. If it hits those levels, next week might see another 5-10% decline. I wouldn’t move until I see these levels.\n\nAlso, I’m a long term buy and hold investor. Short term drops don’t rattle me much, my stock picks reflect 7-10 year horizons. Do your own research and identify your own risk before making buys. If you’re married, always get buy in from your significant other so you can share the blame (rewards).

Just over a month ago we were celebrating a record Profit-Sharing Day; today we face the greatest economic challenge in our history as the world grapples with the growing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.\n\nI want to thank the more than 13,000 people who have stepped up to take voluntary unpaid leaves – this is the most important thing anyone can do right now to support Delta. While I’m grateful to the thousands that have volunteered, we could use more, so please seriously consider whether this is the right short-term decision for you and your family.\n\nEarlier this week I outlined the serious threat to our business and the difficult actions we’re taking over the next few months to protect our company. Our revenue outlook continues to deteriorate in the short term with the decline in travel demand. We’re now projecting our June quarter revenues will be down by $10 billion compared to a year ago – an 80 percent reduction. It’s also clear, given the underlying damage the virus has created to the overall economy, that demand recovery will take an extended period once the virus is contained.\n\nIn light of the unprecedented challenges facing us, we have entered into a $2.6 billion secured credit facility and are drawing down $3 billion under our existing revolving credit facilities. This will help fortify our cash position in the coming weeks and months. To put this in context, despite all the self-help measures we are taking, we are currently burning roughly $50 million in cash each day.\n\nWe also continue working with the President and Congress on disaster relief assistance, which is vital to protect our industry’s critical role in our nation’s economy. Amid those discussions, in recent days some critics have argued that the airlines have not been good stewards of our money during our profitable years. At Delta, nothing could be further from the truth. Our philosophy has always been a simple one: We put 50 percent of our operating cash flow back into our business by investing in our people and our customers, use 30 percent to pay down debt, and return 20 percent to our owners.\n\nIn fact, over the past five years Delta has invested over $20 billion in new aircraft, airport enhancements, technology and customer service improvements; and invested $19 billion in our people via profit-sharing and pension contributions and payments. In addition, we increased base pay by 30 percent during that period and regained the confidence of the financial markets by earning back our investment-grade credit rating. When the extent of the COVID-19 crisis became clear, we immediately suspended our share repurchases, and our **Board of Directors has voted to suspend future dividend payments.**\n\nWhile these actions will help, the innovation of our people has always been our most powerful tool, and we need it more than ever to protect the future of our company. I have received a remarkable number of ideas and offers to help from Delta people across all divisions as well as our merit employees. We’re reviewing them all and will be making decisions soon on next steps to preserve cash, fortify our future and plan for our eventual recovery. We are exploring all options on help we will need from both merit and frontline people.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1584752851.0, "tickers": []}

If you really want to pick individual stocks I recommend finding stocks that you can see clear value in from your own perspective with some dividend history. For example, I love DIS. Note that I do think it will fall further from the $90’s due to short term global economic slowness and COVID related park closures and travel bans, but long term DIS is a clear winner IMHO. It has amazing brand recognition and with a stream service that will surely bring reoccurring subscription income + plenty of room to increase subscription fees they are going to do well over the next decade.\n\nI also like XOM although the world is starting to drift towards less oil dependence for ground transportation there are still many large countries and industries that rely on oil heavily.  This is another case where short term oil industry is under immense pressure due to travel bans, shelter in place restrictions, and the Saudi price war, but long term I see the oil industry going through another round of consolidation and the price of oil will eventually stabilize much higher than where it is today.\n\nI don’t like the automotive industry right now. I suspect many manufacturers are going to get hit very hard over the next 12-18 months as the global economy spins down.  There may not be bailouts this time around for American car makers.\n\nI like airlines, specifically Delta, which are likely to receive some form of a bailout in the near future.  I pick Delta because I fly them often and though flying today is remarkably much less enjoyable than it was 20-30 years ago I think Delta is doing the best of the US airlines right now.\n\nGood luck with your portfolio!", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1584843023.0, "tickers": [["DIS", 1], ["XOM", 1]]}

{"submission_name": "t3_fonc3l", "id": "flj3vhq", "text": "First this has nothing to do with banks running out of cash, so far banks have been very liquid.\n\nThe issue with mREITS is due to their business model. REITS in general use a lot of leverage, however mREITS are unique because they buy mortgage backed securities instead of the underlying real estate directly. In addition, they borrow large sums from banks and other investors to generate higher returns. This is how MBS yielding 2-3% can be turned into a mREIT yielding 5-6%. \n\nmREITS obtain leverage via repos - so the mREIT buys the MBS and borrows the cash via repo from a bank or asset manager, pledging the MBS as collateral for the loan. For example, a bank may lend $100 of cash against $140 of MBS, maintaining the $40 difference as margin, or protection against default.\n\nNext you have coronavirus causing businesses to shut down, cash flows to businesses stop, and therefore businesses have trouble paying their rent. Well those MBS that own commercial real estate where renters aren’t paying rent are now worth a lot less. In the example above say the MBS price falls to $120, to maintain $40 of margin against the original $100 cash loan from the bank the mREIT has the generate $20 of cash to pledge to the bank. \n\nNow on top of this you have investors in mREITS selling because they want to get out of a falling investment and convert their shares to cash. To meet that redemption the mREIT has to sell the underlying MBS to raise cash and payback the investor. Now mREITS are dumping MBS in the market to meet redemptions, causing the prices of MBS to fall further, and now that MBS is worth $100 and the bank is asking for another $20.\n\nIn this situation the mREIT is running out of liquidity, it’s borrowers are asking for more cash or margin to secure their loans, their assets are falling in price and no one wants to buy them, and their investors want their money back. Therefore, the mREIT has large obligations to provide cash to investors and borrowers but few assets available to sell. \n\nThere is also the issue of market liquidity, there are not enough buyers for every seller, so that pushes prices further down. Given the uncertainty the virus has created, investors don’t want to take risk, and companies need to raise cash. \n\nHope this helps, happy to answer any questions.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1585198116.0, "tickers": []}

With a good conservative diversified portfolio and $500 per month, you can eventually create a very healthy income stream. But the catch is you’ll have to reinvest those dividends for 20+ years before it really takes off. If you want an instant boost to your monthly income, you’ll need a massive amount of up front capital as you rightly noted in your question.\n\nI think that’s why so many of the young and impatient turn to real estate. By borrowing money they can get an income stream from a $400k asset flowing for 20% of the up front cost. However that leverage (borrowing) comes with its own risks. Every time there is a housing crash ( or a pandemic!) or whatever it is, many of these ambitious investors lose everything because they lose tenants and can’t pay the mortgages from the millions of dollars worth of property they are renting out. Then again plenty of stock investors use leverage and go broke too so I’m not saying real estate is bad or anything. Just that you have to understand that anything that has a juicy and immediate looking payout probably has the ability to quickly ruin your life (shout out to Wall Street Bets). \n\nBasically the tl;dr of all that is yes dividends can be beneficial to a young and poor investor, but only if that person is willing to wait the 2+ decades it takes for compounding to work its magic.", "score": 23, "created_utc": 1587687033.0, "tickers": []}

Invest in solid companies that are trustworthy or ETFs\n\nPosted by[u/jerschneid](https://www.reddit.com/user/jerschneid/)**38M / 220% FI / RE 2017**[10 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/)📷4📷3\n\n# Timing the market: The absolute worst vs absolute best vs slow and steady\n\n📷\n\nHere's this same info as a visual journey for those visual learners: [https://imgur.com/gallery/BlK4jzM](https://imgur.com/gallery/BlK4jzM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI downloaded the historic S&P 500 data going back 40 years. I dumped everything in Google Sheets and modeled the three different portfolios, named after three fictional friends Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah. All three saved $200 of their income per month for 40 years for a total of $96,000 each. But after 40 years they all ended up with different amounts based on their investment strategies.\n\nTiffany's Terrible Timing\n\nTiffany is the world's worst market timing. She saves $200/month in a savings account getting 3% interest until the worst possible times. She started by saving for 8 years only to put her money in at the absolute market peak in 1987, right before Black Monday and the resulting 33% crash. But she never sold, and instead started saving her cash again, only to do the same at the next three market peaks. Each time she invested the full amount of her saved cash only to watch the market crash immediately after. Most recently she put all her money in the day before the 2007 financial crisis. She’s been saving cash ever since waiting for the next market peak.\n\nWith this perfectly bad market timing, Tiffany still didn’t do too bad. Her $96,000 she saved and invested over the last 40 years is now worth **$663,594**. Even though she invested only at each market peak, her big nest egg is thanks to the power of buying and holding. Since she never sold, her investment always recovered and flourished as the market inevitably recovered far surpassing her original entry points.\n\nBrittany Buys at the Bottom\n\nBrittany, in stark contrast to Tiffany, was omniscient. She also saved her money in a savings account earning 3% interest, but she correctly predicted the exact bottom of each of the four crashes and invested all of her saved cash on those days. Once invested, she also held her index fund while saving up for the next market crash. It can’t be overstated, how hard it is to predict the bottom of a market. In 1990 with war breaking out in the Middle East, Brittany decided to dump all her cash in when the market was only down 19%. But in 2007, the market dropped 19% and she didn’t jump in until it fell all the way down to a 56% drop, again perfectly predicting the exact moment it had no further to fall and dumped in all of her cash just in time for the recovery.\n\nFor this impossibly perfect market timing, Brittany Bottom was rewarded. Her $96,000 of savings has grown to **$956,838** today. It’s certainly an improvement, but interesting to note that when comparing the absolute worst market timing versus the absolute best, the difference is only a 44% gain. Both Brittany and Tiffany have the vast majority of their growth thanks to buying and holding a low cost index fund.\n\nSlow and Steady Sarah\n\nSarah was different from her friends. She didn’t try to time market peaks or valleys. She didn’t watch stock prices or listen to doomsday predictions. In fact, she only did one thing. On the day she opened her account in 1979, she set up a $200 per month auto investment in an S&P 500 index fund. Then she never looked at her account again.\n\nEach month her account would automatically invest $200 more in her index fund at whatever the current price happened to be. She invested at every market peak and every market bottom. She invested the first month and the last month and every month in between. But her money never sat in a savings account earning 3% interest.\n\nWhen Sarah Steady was ready to retire, she signed up for online access to her account (since the internet had been invented since she last looked at it). She was pleasantly surprised with what she found. Her slow and steady approach had grown her nest egg to **$1,386,429**. Even though she didn’t have Brittany’s impossibly perfect ability to know the bottom of the market, Sarah’s investment crushed Brittany’s by more than $400,000.\n\nRecap\n\n* Amount Saved/Invested: $96,000 each\n* Investment: Buy and hold an S&P 500 index fund\n* Tiffany (worst timing in the world): $663,594\n* Brittany (best timing in the world): $956,838\n* Sarah (auto invests monthly): $1,386,429\n\nSo if you’re worried the market is too high and we’re due for a crash. Or you want to wait for the inevitable drop before you put your money in. Think about whether you’re so good at predicting the market you can do it better than Brittany who knew when to invest down to the exact day. And even if you are that good, realize that it’s still a losing strategy to the early and often approach that Sarah executed so flawlessly.\n\nHere's the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nBDkD9Zrjb3VZJy6ZjmPCd3ehoagKMIkw6m3WZvxeTw/edit#gid=0)\n\nfor anyone who wants to see the numbers in action! :)\n\nEdit: Some of you might remember me from my [how I retired at 36 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b41d79/how_i_retired_at_36_a_visual_journey/).

But even then, I'm not sure, because then I would have agonized over at what point to then add the next stock, and then the next.  Perhaps having a goal of $2000 in each stock before adding another might make some sense.\n\nThe brokerage you use might impact your decision making as well.  I use M1 Finance and so they practice dynamic balancing which makes it hard to concentrate your investments into one stock if you're trying to go with the automatic and lazy approach to investing like I am.\n\nIn the end, I don't think it matters much.  The shares in your portfolio in each individual stock won't grow as fast as if you had concentrated them in fewer stocks, but you are also more diversified.  Given our current environment, diversification seem to make more sense than concentration of all your money into 1-3 stocks.\n\nBut, I'm not a financial adviser.

If your goal is to grow your money by having the largest return every year then a growth fund is probably your best bet. Once you get to the point where you have a lot of money, then you can start putting it in value funds for the dividends and there will actually be a noticeable amount rather than a few dollars per month. \nI recommend growth funds until you get older and closer to retirement. Once you’re in retirement, your portfolio should be majority large-value (dividend) funds. That’ll give you actual income rather than a few dollars per month and it’ll be much much more since you have more cash to invest due to the higher return of growth-funds.\n\nEdit: if you want the best of both worlds right now, then I’d recommend picking 2 funds.

Dividend income is based on number of shares owned.

If the company still increases its dividend yearly, this makes the increase in shares even more dramatic. So while you’re total portfolio value decreases, your current income compounds. \n\nMany will argue that this is short sighted, and they have a very valid point.

Dividend yield is the annual payout amount divided by the stock price that you paid for that share.\n\nWarren's average cost per share of KO?

Obviously you would purchase more in time, but the hope is that you will own enough shares for the DRIP to buy you more shares in time.\n\nSo, as an example, for the KO dividend to buy one share for \"free\", you would need to own around 112 shares (if the price is $46). Obviously this takes a lot of time and finances, but is well worth it if you are a buy and hold investor. This is why stocks like T, OKE, etc. are popular is that it doesn't take too many shares to make the drips earn more shares on themselves. T, for example, only needs about 60 shares for you to \"receive\" a free share off of the DRIP off of dividends earned.

{"submission_name": "t3_gvfb8y", "id": "fsoglo6", "text": "This is my psychology and mindset:\n\nI mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses.\n\nSince I intend on holding forever, I must choose well established HIGH-QUALITY BLUE-CHIP DIVIDEND PAYING companies with wide economic moats because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (if not more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity.\n\nPeople often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid. This will be the responsibility of my future children and my future grandchildren.\n\nFinally, it is often said that the first $1,000,000 is the most difficult to secure. Going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 is easier. But, the easiest is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. My overall intent is to be the guy who fucking sets it all up, educates the next generation, and secure generational wealth for my last name. #thuglifeinvesting #thuglifepersonalfinance", "score": 35, "created_utc": 1591133487.0, "tickers": []}
{"submission_name": "t3_gvfb8y", "id": "fsq1je0", "text": "Unless you have a lot of capital up front, large dividends are a long-term destination. What will keep you going every month is adding bit by bit to your future empire. The amount of work that you're doing now to try and cut corners can help you in some ways, but it's going to hurt you in others.   \n\n\nIt sounds like you're going through manic stages thinking about how rich you could be if you bet on just the right horse. I've been there, it's maddening. The truth is that you could....but you almost definitely won't. An investor who invests with their emotions is a bad investor, because the same feeling you get when you buy these high risk stocks will turn into a feeling of panic whenever they do poorly.   \n\n\nI make less than 30k in a year and in 9 months have saved roughly half my income for investing. My initial investment was about $500 from my savings account, plus $400 from my next paycheck. Every month after that I have put in around $500-600 from my paychecks, plus my tax return $600, plus the majority of the stimulus check since I have a job. I started with $700 and with regular, boring ass monthly contributions, plus re-investing all earned dividends, I have amassed a portfolio currently worth $7,946, which is only a little over $500 below where it was pre-pandemic. Barring any more dividend cuts, this nets me over $400 in dividends this year, which will likely hit $500 before the year's end, and this is with a pretty damn safe portfolio.  \n\n\nIs that $500 in dividends this year going to take me to financial bliss? No. But that $500 this year will be like getting an entire extra month's worth of money to invest in, for free. Next year, I will start the year with that extra $500 coming down the line, plus whatever I add to it for the next year, hopefully another $500. Then I'm starting my third year with $1000 in dividends. It's a barrel rolling down the hill, picking up speed. I have about 40 years to invest before I hit senior citizen status. In a worst case scenario, if my life situation never improves money wise and I only ever achieve $500 in new dividends each year on top of my pre-existing dividends...I still make at retirement my take home pay right now.   \n\n\nStatistics have shown that the investors who make the most money are not those who try to time the market, looking for those sweet cheat codes to financial freedom. Instead, the investors who make the most money are the ones who just contribute a regular amount to normal/boring investments every month and never stop.   \n\n\nThere is something to be said for exciting stocks versus boring ones, and that is to say that you should be excited in what you are buying into, but for the right reasons. To me, I see a boring company like LEG or IP and I get excited because I know that they are still going to be in business a decade from now, doing what they're doing, paying me dividends. I also want to buy into companies whose products I like and use, like KO for Coke, UN for Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, T for HBO and Warner Media. But there are also stocks and funds I want to buy into because I legitimately am excited for the work that they do and the potential they have for the future. Those are all things to consider when you are buying a stock. But I think to be the most successful you have to look at the company/fund in these ways, because if you go off of something as volatile as dividend yield it could leave you invested in a company on it's way to disaster.   \n\n\nBy all means, invest in the risky shit, but understand that while all of investing is gambling, that's gambling with your future in a very real way. Keep those stocks to a small amount of your portfolio...use the dividends to buy into safer companies. If they do well you profit regardless, but if they don't do well, it's only a small part of the portfolio. You gotta understand your risk tolerance and learn to stay within those bounds. Keep your regular investments the same but maybe set aside a little money every month just for a risky purchase. At the end of the day, no one can tell you exactly how YOU should be investing, so your best bet is to set goals for yourself that you can readily achieve and then try to hit those goals on a timed basis...weeks, months..whatever. Some sort of metric that shows you are accomplishing goals, that you are making headway, even if it looks like it will take forever...you will have proof that you are making progress. And when you see the numbers increasing and increasing, maybe it will help ease your mind about if you could just cut those corners and invest in all high-yield gambles.", "score": 10, "created_utc": 1591167797.0, "tickers": [["LEG", 1], ["IP", 1], ["KO", 1], ["T", 1]]}

{"submission_name": "t3_gwipbc", "id": "fsvpkbu", "text": "At the risk of being downvoted because I am not providing you with sources of information (as requested by you), I will share with you my mentality and mindset. This is why I personally invest in dividend paying stocks:\n\n1. I mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses.\n2. Since I intend on holding forever, I must choose well established HIGH-QUALITY BLUE-CHIP DIVIDEND PAYING companies with wide economic moats because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (if not more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity.\n\nPeople often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid. This will be the responsibility of my future children and my future grandchildren.\n\nFinally, it is often said that the first $1,000,000 is the most difficult to secure. Going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 is easier. But, the easiest is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. My overall intent is to be the guy who fucking sets it all up, educates the next generation, and secure generational wealth for my last name. #thuglifeinvesting", "score": 20, "created_utc": 1591291632.0, "tickers": []}

You may argue that oil is necessary for petrochemical products such as plastics but there are alternative methods out there for producing these same items that are further cutting into the demand for oil.\n* These companies carry huge amounts of debt since they are in a highly capital-intensive business (the infrastructure they require is very expensive)\n* Profitability of these companies depends on the price of oil which is subject to sudden change/disruption from OPEC/Russia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) MO**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Long term secular decline in industry\n* Number of smokers (4-5% annually) will eat into revenues over the long-term.

I strongly disagree \"that dividend yield is a calculation to effectively analyze the health of the dividend  and the underlying stock versus its price per share\". I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Does a stock that pays 0% imply a \"healthier\" company than a stock that pays 2%? Does a stock that pays 2% yield imply a \"healthier\" company than one that pays 2.5%? Some companies do not pay dividends at all (yield = 0%), are they the \"healthiest\"?\n2. Concerning your question as to  \"why wouldn't most investors focus on the amount per share?\". I cannot speak on behalf of the majority of dividend investors; however as a dividend growth investor with a super long-term horizon, I am ultimately looking for a company with a low-mid payout ratio in order to secure a better yield on cost in the far future.\n\nThere are a lot of variables/factors that go into what one would consider to be a \"healthy\" company.

Its a list of stocks r/dividends favors.\n\nFor each stock, look up its stock price, and how much it pays in dividends per quarter.\n\nLets do $KO Coke, together\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO?p=KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO?p=KO)\n\nThe stock price as of NOW is $47.92\n\n[https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/calendar?symbol=KO](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/calendar?symbol=KO)\n\nI like TD Ameritrade for its dividend calendar (AND NO DAMN ADS) , but yahoo has it too.\n\nThe stock calendar says that if you hold the stock before JUNE 12, 2020 (EX-DIVIDEND date) you will be paid $0.41 a share, to be paid into your account on JULY 1, 2020 (PAY DATE). \n\nNow thats $0.41 per quarter (every 3 months). $0.41 x 4 = $1.64 a year (ANNUAL!!!!)\n\nso your ANNUAL dividend yield = ANNUAL\\_DIVIDEND\\_PAYMENTS / stock\\_price\n\nAnnual\\_Dividend\\_Yield = $1.64 / $47.92\n\nAnnual\\_Dividend\\_Yield = 3.42%\n\nYou can kinda think of this yield like an interest payment. You lend Coke $47.92, and they pay you interest of $0.41, every quarter (3 months). This money goes directly into your brokerage account.\n\nNow, do this calculation for a bunch of stocks on that list i sent you.\n\nKeep doing it until you understand what dividend yield is and its relation to the input variables. Do it by hand, with a hand calculator. \n\nIf you did the exercise, then you might notice something.\n\nIf the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!\n\nSay that in the mirror to yourself ,a hundred times, every morning.\n\nIf the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!\n\nIf the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!\n\nIf the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!\n\nNow, think of what happened in the last few months.\n\nCorona Virus DUMPED the prices of stocks!!!!!\n\nThis was like CHRISTMAS for Dividend investors!!!!\n\nWhile everyone else was crying that their portfolios were dwindling, Dividend Investors were jumping for joy and buying stocks at a record pace! It was like a garage sale! Lots of us ran out of money by the end of March! \n\nWhen the stock market is raging bulls (doing great), Dividend Investors relax, knowing that companies are strong and their dividends are safe. When the market tanks, yes, we may get some dividend cuts on ***OUR GAMBLE BETS***, but we are happy to buy up tons of new shares! \n\nGood market or  bad Market, we are happy", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1591359177.0, "tickers": [["KO", 1], ["TD", 1]]}

All of these are used by the media because none of them are GAAP numbers and so are subject to manipulation.\n\nConsolidated Funds From Operations, or CFFO, is a GAAP number, meaning it is the actual accounting of cash available to REIT management after all operational bills have been paid and any changes in working capital accounts that changes the amount of cash available. It is reported each quarter on the Statement of Cash Flows, one of the 3 required financial reports (Income statement and Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet) are the other two) If you subtract from CFFO any preferred dividends and/or distributions to non-controlling interests, what you then have is Net CFFO.

{"submission_name": "t3_h0z8bb", "id": "ftqgwbd", "text": "Your portfolio looks incredible for a 16 year old with a couple months experience. Here's some advice from me, someone who started last year at 28, and am very jealous of how much further you can go compared to myself lol. I'm just gonna rattle stuff off the top of my head, so there's no particular rhyme or reason for the order in which I list this stuff;  \n\n\n\n* 16 is very young to be planning for your future, and by that I mean things in your life will change drastically in the next two years, and then every year after that until about 25 you and your life is gonna be constantly changing and growing and evolving. Write down now some goals that you want to accomplish in the next 10 years. Then every 6 months from now until then, look at that list and see how you feel about it, Observe if you're on your way to meeting those goals and write down new updated goals if those goals you wrote down have changed in any way. Doing that on a six month basis will not only keep you motivated, but as you grow and spend more time down this path it will allow you to see what is and what is not as important to you anymore. Investing and Personal Finance in general are no different than any other part of your life, it needs to grow with you, not stay unchanged for possibly decades on end.   \n\n\n* Even though it looks like you already have quite a bit of money in the market for only a couple months investing, understand this is a journey that pays off most in the long run. By the way you have worded things, it feels like you're looking more to FIRE than to just build a retirement fund. That makes this point even more important. If you try and rush yourself to FIRE as soon as possible, you're likely going to make rash decisions for what to invest in. Your portfolio at the moment however seems to reflect an understanding of quality companies to invest in. At your age, every dollar invested now is estimated to be worth $4-5 in the future. Keep that in mind as you expand your portfolio and continue down your investment path, your money has the potential to quadruple if you stay the course, investing in good, solid investments.  \n\n\n* Since you're investing in individual companies as well as ETF's, invest some time to understand at least a basic understanding of what your individual companies do, how they operate and what things in the market would cause them to go up in value and down in value. This doesn't have to be deep analysis, but just some general understanding of what it is you're investing in. If you can't summarize in like 30 seconds what a company or fund does and how they make money, you should not invest in it. Knowing MSFT might go up or down based on sale of devices against AAPL's sale of devices is good, but knowing that MSFT's biggest area of expansion is web services, putting them in direct competition with AMZN is better.   \n\n\n* Look for some smaller, but strong dividend growers that could provide you both growth in stock value as well as a dividend. Most of the companies you picked are very solid, but hardly move the needle in terms of value. Nothing wrong with that, especially when starting out, but there are lots of stocks and funds out there that could end up being a titan of your portfolio decades down the line, providing a line of dividends that match some of these dividend titans.   \n\n\n* Make a monthly budget, and update it every time something in your life changes. It has been proven by multiple studies that the people in the stock market who make the most money are those who invest a regular amount of money every month and every year, regardless of how the market is doing on a month to month basis. Budgeting allows you to see how much money you can safely contribute to investments without making yourself broke in the meantime to accomplish your goals. Make sure any financial obligations are taken care of first, and make sure you can live your day to day life without the amount of money being put into investments. You do not want to miss out on fun with your friends or skimp on eating meals solely because you chose to spend your last $100 to gain $1.76 a year from DIS. \n  \n\n* By that same token, make sure you are paying yourself by putting a monthly contribution to savings in a savings account, even better if it has a high yield.  When it comes to investing and personal finance, you want to make sure you have a healthy amount of money saved up to tap into in case something unexpected happens. This savings account is not only a tool to help you build your personal wealth and help you buy more expensive things in life, but this is also a buffer against having to ever touch your investments in case of emergency. If your car suddenly needs emergency repairs, if your pet (or child) needs an emergency medical visit, if your mattress falls out of the back of your friend's pickup while moving across town (all have happened to me between 18-28) your savings account will exist as a safety net for how you will pay for it. If it can be avoided, you do not want to ever have to sell your investments in order to pay for an unexpected expense.   \n\n\n* Know your tax obligations for your investments. I do not know how taxes on dividends work for a minor or know your specific tax situations going forward; but I do know that at some point and in some time you will have to declare your dividends for tax purposes. Know that dividends from REIT's and MLP's are taxed as if you earned that money normally, and must pay tax on them, whereas regular stocks and funds have a different threshold entirely for how they are taxed...which for me is not at all at the moment. These investing subs praise O for it's amazing dividend, but hardly anyone talks about how you owe taxes on all those O dividends since it's a REIT.   \n\n\n* If you don't have one already, open a ROTH IRA as soon as you are able to. You are only allowed to contribute $6,000 a year of your own money into it, but the money sits there until you are 60 growing tax free. This is the perfect place for REIT's because you will never have to pay taxes on those dividends while they are in there. Have a ROTH IRA with some solid investments and solid REIT's in it and contribute a regular monthly amount to it as well.   \n\n\n* Last but not least, have fun with it! Growing your wealth should be a fun, if not a little boring. At any time if it causes you stress or hardship, you gotta evaluate what and why that is. In my first couple months I invested in things that were much riskier than I should have been dealing with, and I spent every waking moment obsessing over those choices. As they dropped in value, I questioned everything I had done up to this point, and as they rose in value I panicked over whether I was making the right choice by keeping them instead of selling at a profit. It consumed me, worrying that every move I was making was wrong. For now it seems like you've avoided that particular pitfall. But keep an eye on your future possible investments. Make up a watchlist of potential future stock picks, and keep an eye on them as you go. By the time you consider adding another stock to your portfolio from your watchlist, you at that point should have a decent idea of how it performs, what you are expecting to happen as you buy in.

Unsustainable payout ratios i.e the company is paying too much of its income in dividends and might cut them in the future\n2. Lack of growth opportunities for the business.. if a company doesn't see many opportunities to reinvest in the business they may choose to pay out a higher percentage of income in dividends\n3. more mature businesses typically payout higher dividends. once again, these businesses are not growing that much, maybe in line with GDP growth. so the potential for stock price appreciation might be limited. \n\nHope this helps.", "score": 9, "created_utc": 1592293156.0, "tickers": []}

But I've always been risk-adverse. My family loves to go gambling at the casino. When I go, I have a hard time parting with $100 if I don't win it back. I also have notoriously bad instincts when it comes to finances, and have had to severely plan and structure my spending to make sure I don't make wasteful purchases or throw money at something on a whim and then never getting it back. Right now I am invested in 10 dividend stocks and I have 1 purely growth stock, a play for the future with a small amount of money. If it does well over time, I'll DCA in to a larger position and ride it out for quite some time, maybe into retirement with the rest of my funds.   \n\n\nWhat I like better about dividends is having the power of compound interest on my side. I can take anything I earn from dividends and keep rolling it into bigger and bigger investments that don't cost me anything while also continually investing with my own money to grow the dollars earned even faster. While holding a growth stock can be cool, especially if it's something insane like TSLA...but I feel like for someone like me, holding onto stuff like that would just make me nervous about finding the right time to sell. My portfolio is potentially running 40 years with me into retirement, do I want 40 years of wondering when the best time to sell my investment is?   \n\n\nI'd rather hold and collect money at the same time, and if I want to sell my stocks at retirement for the big cash out I can...or I can keep holding to collect the dividends and the portfolio could potentially keep paying after I'm dead.

If you want a solid starting point I would suggest looking up Joseph Carlson and viewing his portfolio and adding/subtracting stocks from it as you see fit. Idk I prefer doing this and in effect curating my own little ETF. You can supplement it with actual ETF’s but from my perspective it’s more engaging to have some say in where your money goes instead of just going with an index.

{"submission_name": "t3_hd94si", "id": "fvjui8y", "text": "*\" My question is why are not dividend ETFs not recommended more around here? \"*\n\nI can speak only for myself, but here are a couple of reasons:\n\nExpenses. If you hold a dividend paying ETF and dividends as income is your primary goal, then depending on the ETF, you may be giving up >10% of the fund's total dividends to expenses. I call it the Income Expense Ratio. You can determine this for a given ETF by going to their annual shareholder report, go to the Statement of Operations and find the total of fund expenses and dividend this by the fund's total income (dividends and interest). That is the IER.\n\nYou must hold low yielding stocks, junky dividends or very risky dividend stocks if they are part of the universe of stocks the ETF must hold. For example, the REIT ETF VNQ must hold the likes of BDN and SNH and whatever the new name of GOV is. These REITs are dogs by any other name and I would never hold them. But as part of the ETF, you must.\n\nIf the ETF is industry specific, then you are diversifying for non-systematic risk (individual security risk), but you are actually concentrating broad industry risk. Consider the financials ETF XLF. From the summer of 2007 when priced at around $30, by early 2009 it dropped to under $10. It took the fund to the end of 2019 to get back to $30. Dividends/share paid in 2007 were $.87. This dropped to $.16 in 2010, growing to $.58 for 2019.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1592757750.0, "tickers": [["BDN", 1]]}

Don't put your money there. Feel free to research a company if you are curious, but don't invest until you can explain how that company makes money to a five year old.\n\n2) When picking a company, it needs to pass three tests for me. Is revenue growing at a steady/sustainable pace?  Is profit growing at a steady/sustainable pace? Is the divided growing at a steady/sustainable pace?\n\n3) Don't let any company become more than 5% of your portfolio. Diversification is important. Never put all your eggs in one basket.\n\n4) Don't chase yield. Look at the yield in relation to the payout ratio. That will give you a more accurate picture. If you have a company with a 5% divided yield but a 30% payout ratio, you may have just stumbled on a bargain. \n\n5) Inflation is an obstacle you must conquer to have sustainable passive income. If a company is growing their divided slower than inflation, while simultaneously paying out a divided lower than inflation, you are losing money. I've seen too many dividend investors forget inflation and subsequently realize they are making less year over year because of it. \n\nThese are just some starter pieces of advice that most people don't think about as much as they really should.", "score": 14, "created_utc": 1593191596.0, "tickers": []}

T is the exception, not the rule.  Yield chasing is not how you want to live your life. Nobody makes money yield chasing. Every yield chaser loses money. \n\nBut anyways, lets take a look:\n\n>Energy Transfer\n\n2/10. Sell. Revenue and Profit are soaring, but the dividend is remaining stagnant.  However, the payout ratio is also simultaneously somehow way too high. The company is taking on debt to fund a dividend, when the company isnt even 20 years old. It is always concerning when a young company is taking on debt to pay a dividend. \n\nThis company clearly is either staffed with incompetent management, greedy management who prioritize their own paychecks over the long term health of the company, or some combination of the two. \n\nGood replacement: Dominion Energy. \n\n>Chimera\n\n0/10. Sell. Similar to ET. Debt to fund the dividend is never healthy. Except this company is actually reducing its dividend while still taking on debt to fund the reduced dividend.  This is how companies enter death spirals.\n\n In 2010 it paid out $.76 a share. Yet now you are getting $0.30 a share in 2020. Sell out and write this loss off.\n\nGood replacement: Home Depot (add some diversity to your portfolio)\n\n>Altria\n\n3/10. Sell. Cigarettes are a dirty business.  They are all effectively squeezing blood from a stone right now. The smoking population has been going nothing but down for decades. The addictive properties of cigarettes make for a good recurring customer base, but unfortunately cigarettes have a tendency to kill their best customers. Rapid price increases are leading to record profits now, but they are pricing out potential new customers. Smoking rates for young people are at historic lows, and just keep getting lower. Eventually, this company will start to slide, then it will be nothing but down.   Due to the taxes on cigarettes, decreasing the price is virtually impossible.\n\nI would stay away from the industry as a whole, because once the slide starts, it will never stop. \n\nGood replacement: Kimberly Clark. The women in your life need tampons, and the babies of the world need diapers. Kimberly Clark is a market leader in both.\n\n>ATT\n\nI'm actually pretty bullish on AT&T. Management hadnt been held accountable for quite some time, but now someone is holding their feet to the fire, and the company looks poised to clean itself up. Even if it doesn't, the dividend is well covered by earnings and the company has an IP library rivalled only by Disney.\n\nCompanion pick: Verizon.  I like T and Verizon to be equal weight in my portfolio.\n\n>Enterprise\n\nI would hold for right now and see which way the wind blows. Lots of debt to fund prior dividends. Company looks like it is trying to turn itself around. \n\nReplacement if the company regresses: Microsoft. Well diversified tech company.\n\n>Universal\n\nDon't really have strong opinions on this one to make a definitive judgement. I haven't looked at the numbers enough. I would compare and contrast it with Disney, then pick whichever has the better balance sheet. \n\n>SImon properties\n\nJust announced a dividend cut. No thank you.

Dividend Growth: A company growing its dividends consistently is a great indicator of financial and operational health.\n3. Earnings/Free Cash Flow Growth: A company’s cash floe must coincide with dividend growth. If cash flow does not grow with the dividend, the company cannot afford to grow its dividend indefinitely.\n4. Interest Coverage: Can the company pay its debt? Interest Coverage compares the company’s  earnings to the interest expense on debt. It is ideal for earnings to be at least twice that of its interest expense. A score of 26 is excellent and indicates earnings far exceed debt.\n5. Debt To Equity Ratio: A higher score is a better score. The higher a specific securities’ percentile, the better.\n6. Credit Rating: The better the rating, the better a company’s credit worthiness as a borrower. This indicates a good ability to pay back debts, which is itself a good indicator of good financial position.\n7. Prior Recession Performance: Did the company collapse? Did the stock take a hit? Did it rebound? A longer history is often a good indicator of health. Companies like Visa only went public in 2008, so there is not much information on Visa in this regard.\n8. Cyclicality: General Mills has smooth and steady earnings. People want to constantly eat their food products. On the other hand, clothing stores\n9. Dividend Longevity: How long has the company paid the dividend? Have they consistently paid dividends?\n10. Company Values, Culture, and Commitment to Dividends: Realty Income (O) is all about dividends—it is a culture of dividends and commitments to investors.", "score": 9, "created_utc": 1593541616.0, "tickers": []}

So operating cash flow is typically bigger than income unless the company owes services to a lot of people and doesn't have a lot of depreciation they can claim (red flag if you ever see this). The capital expenditures is where the company is allocating its capital and includes items like purchases of property and equipment, acquisitions, dispositions, and construction. So a company's free cash flow is higher than its income if the income is less than the difference between its operating cash flow and its capital expenditures (pretty much all of the time).\n\nSo no, its probably not because there is a backlog of orders, because that would drive the FCF down since they would have a high amount of accounts payable (assuming the companies that have ordered items paid for them)", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1594160722.0, "tickers": [["FCF", 1]]}

This company has been in my portfolio since the early days. A very good choice.\n\n>Altria\n\nThere are many reasons to avoid the cigarette industry.  For starters, it is a dirty business. Your best customers are the ones who die from your products. The other major issue is that smoking rates among young people have been going nothing but down for decades. Despite the smoking rate decreasing, profits have never been higher. This is because prices have been rising year over year. Unfortunately for the cigarette companies, these price increases are the economic equivalent of squeezing blood from a stone. As the price rises, you are pricing potential customers out of the market, making the product unaffordable to most consumers. The average cost of a pack of cigarettes in the US was $5.51, though in most states it is between $6-$8.  Multiply $5.51*365 and you get a whopping $2011.15 to maintain one's smoking habit for a single year. Most Americans cannot afford that.  The taxes states impose on cigarettes are not meant to help people quit. They are designed to prevent people from starting.  I would never recommend trying to enter an industry the US government is actively trying to tax into the grave.\n\nAt some point, there will come a time when the price of a pack is so high that there is no turning back. When the slide in revenue starts, it will never stop. When that happens, I don't know, but considering the unsustainable rock bottom smoking rates of young people, it will likely be within your lifetime. Perhaps even within mine. \n\nTo its credit, Altria is trying to buck the trend. It is trying to be the exception and diversify its business. The company is developing a balance sheet that could be incredibly robust for the long term. No matter how good this company looks on paper though, I could never invest.  Here's why:\n\n[The following is not based on any data]\n\nMy father-in-law was a prolific smoker. Specifically of Marlboro cigarettes. The iconic packaging was an inseparable part of his personality, as he would always have a pack on his person at all times. My wife and I are both disgusted by cigarettes, but things reached a boiling point at our wedding. I'm actually allergic to certain chemicals in cigarettes, and so is my dad and his parents. My grandmother's allergy in particular advanced so badly that by the time in her life when my wife and I got married, she required an epi-pen to inhale cigarette smoke. As a result, we told my wife's family filled with chain smokers that there would be no cigarettes at our wedding at any time, so my grandmother could actually survive being outside her house (located next to a Mormon church with all Mormon neighbors).  The entirety of my wife's family completely understood and was very respectful, making great efforts to purge the cigarette smell from their persons. The one exception was my father in law. Long story short, my wife actually cried on our wedding day because he left the festivities three separate times to light up. As the father of the bride in an American wedding, his absence was noticed. After the third time, he smelled so bad I had to ban my own father in law from my own wedding so he would not hurt my grandma's sensitive lungs. She uses oxygen anyways, but considering the severity of her allergy, she can't be within a few feet of cigarette smoke without feeling the effects.\n\nThe worst part came when we found out my father in law was raping kids.  Thankfully he never did anything to my wife when she was growing up, but my father-in-law is currently sitting in prison for molestation of a 14-year-old. When we found out, instantly anything associated with the man became repulsive and drew up memories of my wife having a pedophile as a dad. That included his favorite brand of cigarettes, Marlboro, which is manufactured in the United States by Philip Morris USA (not to be confused with ticker PM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria. \n\nMy wife sees Altria's dividend as blood money, as she wants nothing to do with her father (for obvious reasons) and so I will never buy stakes in Altria or any tobacco company, regardless of how well they perform in the market.\n\n[Ending my opinion not based on data]\n\nWith that being said, Altria is currently allegedly in talks to reunite with Philip Morris international, which shows the companies know the end is near. They likely see consolidation and diversification as their only way out.\n\nRecommended replacement: Kimberly Clark. I seem to find myself recommending this one in every dividend analysis. It is just simply a well run company.\n\n>Coca Cola\n\nBeautiful company.  Nuff said.\n\nRecommended companion stock: Pepsico. I like to keep an equal combination of Coke and Pepsi in my portfolio. \n\n>IBM\n\nThis would have been an excellent pick in 1971. IBM today is a shell of its former self. Revenue has shed nearly $5 billion in the last five years. YoY profits have fallen in almost perfect lockstep with revenue, indicating this is not the company selling off unprofitable businesses. Operating Income is down by nearly 40% in the past five years, with net income down by around 30% in the same time period. All this has put the dividend under enormous pressure, as the payout ratio has roughly **doubled** over the past five years, when the dividend itself has only grown by around 25-30% in the same time. \n\nIBM is a perfect example of why you should never trust EPS. The company engaged in an extensive share buyback program through the 2010s which has masked these underlying problems. Management has already deflected responsibility onto the covid pandemic for 2020, but shareholders have stopped listening entirely. The company was down pre-pandemic, and it likely won't recover from the February sell-off anytime soon. I would steer clear, at least while this board maintains control. \n\nRecommended replacement: Microsoft.\n\n>Walgreens\n\nAs a retail manager, analysis of retail companies is my area of expertise. In my personal opinion, I don't think management really knows what they are doing. The company has grown revenue by 30% in the past five years, but net income is...down.  As a retail manager, that is not how this is supposed to work. I can understand selling more lower margin products, but it is almost as though the company is branching out into unproductive and unprofitable side ventures.  The company seems aimless and unfocused, testing many new concepts at once, not really sure what will stick. \n\nCompare that with CVS, who recognized that in order to make it in the digital age, they needed to reinvent themselves. In 2018 the company made record amounts of profit, but chose to show a loss on their balance sheet. The company stopped raising the dividend and plowed every cent of available capital into the business and reinvesting in the company. Normally I hate stagnant dividends with a burning passion, but as someone who has spent their entire career in retail, I understand every word coming out of the CEOs mouth on their plan for the future and how they are trying to optimize the omnichannel experience, and I see the company's end vision, both in their investor materials and in my Google results.  When I search for pharmacy near me, the top three organic results are for CVS. However, if we actually measured it with a tape measure, the closest pharmacy is actually inside my local Kroger and practically within walking distance. \n\nEven though I am bullish on CVS, I'm not going to recommend it. This is a stock I would only suggest buying if you understand retail. Even then, it is not for everyone. My recommended replacement for Walgreens would have to be Johnson and Johnson.\n\n>Wells Fargo\n\nConsidering the company just cut its dividend, and has mountain of lawsuits related to its verified fraud, I would stay away.\n\nRecommended replacement: Bank of America or JP Morgan. \n\n>AT&T\n\nI'm really bullish on AT&T long term. I think the Warner media empire is a force capable of rivaling Disney if wielded properly. Should the company be unsuccessful, it still has a massive reservoir of free cash flow capable of sustaining the dividend for quite some time.\n\n>Enterprise Products Partners L.P.\n\nNatural gas is not a very good long term play for someone your age.  If you were fifty, then maybe it would make sense, however, most utility companies see natural gas merely as a transition to cleaner forms of energy, and simply a way to meet emissions reduction goals for 2030 or whatever deadline the company has. Every US based publicly traded pureplay utility company I can find has on their website their intention to become carbon neutral or at the bare minimum reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.\n\nRecommended replacement: NextEra Energy\n\nI appear to have reached reddit's character limit, since my mobile app is not allowing me to type more characters.

It is still historically low and buying on the dip is a strategy and with a high div you can come out ahead.  My concern is that GLAD invest in small/midcap corporate debt. Depending on how this rona plays out, these small/mid companies will struggle more than a large corp would.

{"submission_name": "t3_hphl16", "id": "fxs5bph", "text": " \n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n1. Personally for me, regardless of conditions, there is no change in plan/strategy. As an individual with a stable income, high job security, a decent emergency fund, and zero debt, I am always 100% equities and there will be no change in buying more or less. I do not care about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever we are on the \"graph\". I do not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, I really, really, really, do not care at all. Volatility does not mean anything to me since I am a super long-term investor;\n2. I openly admit that I am not a smart person, I am not a very well educated person, I cannot predict the future, and I certainly cannot time the market. Personally, I believe that time in the market is superior to timing the market (as per academic studies). Therefore, I invest on average, half of my pay, every time I get paid (i.e. every two weeks) because I am boring and I am stubborn. You will see many posts on reddit which speculate about what is going to happen in the future or strangers asking for predictions from other strangers. Again, I am not a smart person, but I can tell you that those people are really, really, really, not smart either and that you should just invest regularly and as much as you can while balancing a proper quality of life (whatever that means to you);\n3. I also mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses;\n4. Since I intend on holding forever, I must choose well-established, high-quality, premium, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats and a proven track record of paying/increasing dividends through tough times because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion, which may be incorrect) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional minimal annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (and most probably more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity;\n5. Since I am not an \"intelligent\" person, I do not \"daytrade\", I do not \"buy low, sell high\", I do not play with \"penny stocks\", and I do not try to \"time the market\". I am a \"dividend growth investor for the SUPER long-term\" (which will be defined in point #7);\n6. I am happy in times of recession/depression since it allows me to buy more shit on sale and lock-in those \"future yields on cost\" as I have a stable income and a very secure job;\n7. People often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid. This will be the responsibility of my future children and my future grandchildren;\n8. Again, generally speaking, I do not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects my purchasing behavior). I will simply continue with my unshakable discipline in my plan to buy well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until I retire or die (even though statistically I will under perform an index ETF, but again, I am not smart nor educated); and\n9. Finally, it is often said that the first $1,000,000 is the most difficult to secure. Going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 is easier. But, the easiest is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 due to miracle of compounding. My overall intent is to be the guy who fucking sets it all up, educates the next generation, and secure generational wealth for my last name. Essentially, I am building a financial fortress brick-by-brick every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" because I am a boring investor who just simply doesn't give a fuck about volatility and I do not think that you should either).\n\nThat is my investing philosophy and why I invest for dividends.

My company also matches 6% and I personally hated their funds but am happy they allow for self directed investment, so I just do my own research and invest in those funds. What I recommend is to look at your salary or previous tax returns and see what brackets you fall under. After doing that adjust your pre-tax contributions to keep yourself in the reasonably lowest tax bracket and then put the rest in after tax (so that any dividends/growth aren’t subject to income tax when you withdraw during retirement). I plan to do this in the early stages of my career when I’m not making the full potential of my anticipated career earnings. As I get older and make a bigger salary, I will shift more towards pretax since retirees tend to be in a lower tax bracket than where they were in the peak of their career.\n\nIf you can max out your 401k, open a Roth IRA which will allow you to invest another $6k/year after taxes and all growth/dividends will be tax free. The downside to this is you’ll have to wait till your 59 years old to touch that money\n\nIf you still have money leftover, that is when you can put it in taxable brokerages.\n\nIn reality, only invest what you know you don’t need anytime soon.

A lot of these management services actually still charge commissions on trades, and depending on where you work, you might have to pay those commissions yourself. By linking a commission free brokerage that supports 401(k)s like M1 or Charles Schwab, you can save a lot of money in the long run by cutting those commissions out of your life.

My rule of thumb is that you should only have as many individual companies in your portfolio that you feel comfortable learning about in-depth and following regularly. If you're someone who can keep up with forty companies, then go for it and enjoy the personal ETF you've crafted. If that's not you (and I assume most people can't or won't put in the work to keep up on all of these companies), you should put the money from these positions into ETFs that will diversify you and ensure that bad picks go by the wayside.\n\nI would even suggest that you drop your list of individual company holdings beyond 20 and move to sector-specific ETFs that hold the underlying companies you were interested in, though others may disagree. It all depends on how in-depth and hands-on you intend to be.\n\nBefore I go into your individual holdings, I do want to make a note: be cautious with your gain of 14%. While you're right to celebrate, it is to note that **if you bought in around March 10th-20th, you would basically always be up that much no matter who you bought into** so long as they didn't go out of business (sorry, $HTZ). The measure of your success will come from your long-term performance, and while you should be excited right and riding the high of gains, it's important to understand **why** those gains happened. They exist partially from solid picks, but also because of general market trends that have brought money into the market and created demand, which has driven prices up since the massive dip in March.I understand that going through each of your picks might be a waste of my time if you never read this, OP. I feel a little stupid for spending time writing my rationale for every penny stock you own two shares of, but I feel as though it's solid practice for me to do brief analysis and will be helpful to you as well.\n\n# I have listed these in the order your post goes over them, not in any other order.\n\nPicks that I agree with:  \n\n\n**$STAG,** solid growth opportunities, and a solid dividend, especially for a REIT!  \n\n\n**$ABBV,** I love dividend aristocrats. Abbvie has great growth and dividend appreciation opportunities in its future. Great pick here.  \n\n\n**$K,** Kellog is a staple of consumer life in the US. They're going to be around for a long time, I imagine, and you're right to look at their history as a good sign of future dividend appreciation even if their stock continues to trade sideways as it has.  \n\n\n**$KDP,** I'm personally a consumer of both Keurig products and Dr. Pepper. That being said, I believe in their brand and potential for growth. With a 35.38 P/E ratio, their price reflects the potential for future growth at well. They're a five-year winner with 138% growth. That all comes in the last 2.5 years, so it's worth a look into why they stagnated between 2016-2018.  \n\n\n**$KR,** with a massive, nationwide brand, I see Kroger being able to maintain trading sideways and paying out their modest dividend. Keeping this means you believe that they will grow or continue their grow their dividend while never declining. With a payout ratio of 29%, they look very sustainable.  \n\n\n**$LOW,** great growth potential as I don't see e-commerce having as much success in hardware and gardening as it has in replacing retailers like bookstores, and great dividend history. Solid pick here.  \n\n\n**$MSFT,** a solid chunk of my portfolio is in Microsoft. I absolutely agree with this.  \n\n\n**$PNC,** while I believe that there are better-positioned banks currently, PNC has shown itself to be somewhat reliable as it didn't slash its July dividend. That being said, expect that if their price returns to pre-March levels, their dividend yield will become 2.3% again.  \n\n\n**$SIRI,** with a solid foothold in the car radio market, Sirus has room to grow, especially with their weather, navigation, and other smart features aimed at keeping their customers on the Sirius platform and off their smartphones. As cheap as it is, it might be a good speculation pick.  \n\n\n**$VZ,** telecom has proven to be a staple in many of the portfolios you'll see on here. Between this and $T, you'd be alright going either way in my opinion. A solid dividend payer for sure.  \n\n\n**$BRK.B,** not sure what you believe Buffet's reputation to be, but Berkshire has been holding up to their M.O. in the last few months. Typical of a company whose holdings include GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen (i.e. no other company), Berkshire recently bought natural gas infrastructure. Berkshire is meant to be the most diversified single company in existence. It's a conglomerate and when Buffet decides to make another deal, I expect it to be another industry they don't have their foot in, but nothing incredibly crazy. His personal holdings are now almost 50% in Apple Inc., but Berkshire doesn't own a lot of tech firms. Take that as you will.  \n\n\n**$DIS,** with their grip on US copyright laws firm and showing no signs of letting go, Disney will be a great investment for the future and should continue to make acquisitions of any real competitors. They seem to be acting strangely with park openings lately, but ultimately their media empire is why their stock price is worth anything anyway.\n\nPicks I don't know about:  \n**$CARR,** with an IPO in April, it's unclear where Carrier Global will go in the public market. I have $RTX, the company they spun off of, in my portfolio. Definitely adding this to my watchlist.  \n\n\n**$LUV,** I personally also prefer to fly Southwest when I fly domestically. That being said, you're brave to be in an airline right now and I would say that if you intend to hold this that you pay very close attention to the news around this one in particular as the entire sector is hurting badly.  \n\n\n**$SFYX,** I'm not incredibly familiar with small-cap companies, but the red-flag I see here is their largest holding is currently cash. I truly think this is too new for me to evaluate.  \n\n\n**$LVGO,** another new stock that I can't do a ton of analysis on. Their one-year RSI shows that they are currently overbought, but that may adjust if they are able to find resistance at their new price floor. I would advise you to keep an eye on this one.  \n\n\n**$OSS,** with talk about chip manufacturers making use of their technology, they may be a great pick. They are a speculative pick and I would say that you should be familiar with their product if you intend to hold any significant amount of One Stop Systems.  \n\n\n**$PINS,** I don't believe that they can break into the same position that Facebook is in. They are not necessarily fighting for market share, however, because many Facebook/Instagram users also have a Pinterest account. They are fighting for screen time and ad time. They may have a great future, but it's too soon to tell and they can be a great tech stock to speculate on.  \n\n\n**$PTON,** I have no clue what the at-home gym market will look like after the pandemic is over. Based on how new Peloton is, they don't either. Might be a good long position or a good play to end and take profits on now; that's unclear to me.  \n\n\n**$TMFC,** I would advise that if you wanted an ETF run by financial analysts that you take something with better returns like $ARKW or really anything from the ARK family. Those are actively managed funds which will cost you more in management fees, but the idea is that the extra growth will be worth it.\n\n(Part 2 is being commented on this post.)", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1595147952.0, "tickers": [["PNC", 1], ["RSI", 1]]}

Looking at $MSFT, their yield is 0.98%, meaning you will see less than 1% of your investment returned to you in dividends a year. But that's assuming that the stock doesn't grow. Over the last five years, $MSFT has increased its price by around \\~350%.  \n\n\nThere is no company on the planet that pays 70% dividends annually. You just won't find anything like that.  \n\n\nFor most of us, dividends accompany growth. You shouldn't just chase one or the other and having a mix of well-paying dividend stocks along with stocks that don't grow. For example, I have both $O (a REIT that has paid consistently increasing dividends for a very long time, you'll hear them a lot here) as well as $NET (who pays no dividends at all) in my portfolio. I didn't buy Cloudflare shares thinking they were going to pay me out anything. Instead, I intend to count on their growth as a company moving forward so that my returns will come with their share price increasing.  \n\n\nIf you're looking to see 50% returns on your money, dividends won't cut that for you. But understand that with reward comes risk. Investments that can double your money in the course of a small timeframe come with heavy risk. For every $MSFT, there are dozens of companies that have done horribly and have lost (50%) of their value in the last five years (looking at you, $F.)  \n\n\nThat growth is traded for higher returns in funds like $QYLD where they can promise a 10% dividend yield but basically permanently trade sideways. They disclose this and make it clear that their primary objective is income and not growth. It's up to you what to put your money in, but I would make sure you know what your goals are and what investments you want to make sure to achieve them.  \n\n\nIf you're very young (which is the feeling I get since you said you're a student), then I would absolutely recommend looking at higher growth opportunities. Dividends can be great and you can get a lot of satisfaction out of seeing them DRIP back into your investments, but I caution you against thinking in black and white with your portfolio -- that it has to be all or nothing.

It didn't take very long imo to get a response to my question, and I seem to recall that was even on a weekend. In general, I've considered being with them a very smooth and empowering experience.\n\nI have more money now than I've ever had in my life, and I'm not saying I couldn't have similar results with any other brokerage. That's just a matter of what strategy you're going for, and you can do that anywhere. But it's just that that the features M1 offers have made it about as easy as possible to get there.\n\nReally, there's very little else that I might ask for, as far as my needs go. Depending on your investing style / goals, other brokerages might be a better fit (especially if you're day trading and want to buy/sell things at the perfect millisecond). But I'm about dollar cost averaging over decades, and never selling anything if I can avoid it.\n\nI've had enough bad experiences trying to get-rich-quick with market timing. I've just managed to squander thousands of dollars playing that game. The get-rich-slowly method seems WAY more reliable.

My net worth and dividend income keeps increasing every month. And so it will continue over the next couple decades. So for my investing priorities, I think M1 is pretty awesome. They've given me some incredibly easy and useful tools to build my portfolios and I've had zero bad experiences along the way.\n\nThe main downside for me is they don't currently have custodial accounts.

This is 2020, you don't need to pay to trade stocks. \n\n3. Compound interest is your best friend. You want to plow every single cent of dividends back into your portfolio. Warren Buffet has earned over $100billion over the course of his life. 99% of that money was earned after he turned 56.  The power of compounding is not something to be taken lightly.\n\n4.

Any company that manufactures tools stands to benefit a great deal, especially those whose products bear a \"Made in the USA\" label.\n\n2: Hormel Foods (HRL)\n\nIf you live in the United States and shop at a grocery store other than Whole Foods, there is statistically a good chance you have a product produced by Hormel sitting either in your fridge, pantry, or next grocery list right now. While this company is best known for SPAM, the reality is that this is an incredibly well diversified food manufacturer who next year will celebrate their 130th anniversary. I know they will live to see that anniversary because covid is barely registering on this company's radar at the moment. With [dozens of food brands](https://www.hormelfoods.com/brands/?group=all) under their name, the company is well diversified to weather any fads in consumer food spending. Not to mention the market dominance of several company brands like Skippy Peanut Butter and Hormel Pepperoni.\n\nHormel is a trusted name, even amongst the ecologically conscious. The company is committed to making its products in as environmentally friendly way as possible, which means they are well positioned to survive as Gen Z (who has made it clear they care very much about the environment) develops spending power and begins buying groceries.\n\nFor those of you heartless types though who only care about numbers. Hormel has a 52 year dividend growth streak, 16% average 5y growth rate, payout ratio of 56%, and the stock price has increased by 400% over the past ten years. What more do you want them to do? \n\n3: Stock Yards Bancorp\n\nA well run regional bank based out of Louisville, Kentucky. That's all it is. The dividend [has never been cut](https://www.snl.com/IRW/Dividend/100548) in company history. Payout ratio is good, the bank is growing in a sustainable manner. It doesn't need to be a Mega company to deliver a good return to the few shareholders it does have. We Kentuckians just know how to run a business (Papa John was from Indiana before any memesters try to bring him up.)\n\nThis company is so boring nobody has cared enough to actually make this company a Wikipedia page. It is so boring my brokerage does not even have the company's logo show up when i look at the stock. It just has the ticker symbol SYBT as its image. This is a snoozefest of a company media wise. Perfect for an investor looking for a bargain. This company is so well run its price recovered faster than any of the big banks, and is currently beating Q2 revenue estimates. This company is destined to become a major player in the roads less travelled in the US. Hell, give it enough time and it could likely dethrone a banking titan. After all, this company has the best management I have ever seen of any bank ever. Either way, its not going anywhere.\n\n4: Microsoft.\n\nA bit cliche, but a true dividend payer. Well diversified with significant room to grow. This TikTok thing is just a drop in the bucket to them long term. Even if the deal goes up in smoke, Microsoft will still be just fine.\n\nIts 11:40 at night and I have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to call it quits here. [This is my portfolio. ](https://m1.finance/5pfRVMQqi84h)I could sit here all day and recommend every single company in this portfolio, but I won't.

It means buy good solid companies like Microsoft, Apple, Pfizer.  These are companies with solid financials, steady growth, a fair to middling dividend and they will be around in 40 more years.  \n\nStay away from the fads, the reddit du jour stocks like weed stocks and high yield traps.  The stock that pays you 14% is also likely to lose you 25% of your principal in the same time.  It's math, you pay for the yield somehow.  \n\nThe dividend yield is the last number you should look at.  Way more important are the revenues, profits and growth of the same.  Know what the company makes, sells, delivers before you buy it.  Buy what you know or think you know not what the crowd is purchasing.\n\nTake advantage of bad news.  My favorite day of the week is when earnings disappoint.  Take for instance MMM.  MMM has been on my want list since I sold it last.  I love the company, I have owned it 3 times and made money each time.  Several weeks ago MMM disappointed at earnings and dropped from $163 to $154, I bought 100 shares,  the drop continued to $149 so I bought another 100 shares.  When it started to rise again, I bought another 135 shares.  Guess where MMM is today, higher than it was when it disappointed.  I used the drop to build a position that is already up $4k and now my 2nd largest holding.  \n\nDon't be afraid to take profits but also don't be afraid to let some ride.  In my experience when you pick a BIG winner take some profit and let the rest ride.  I bought FB when the IPO crashed and burned (see bad news).  The IPO price was $38 a share, several days later, it could be had for 1/2 of that, I bought 575 shares.  When it had quadrupled I sold off enough to cover my initial investment and let the rest ride.  By selling enough to cover my investment, I eliminated the stress of volatility.  \n\nIt is far better to buy 57 shares of 1 stock than 1 share of 57 stocks.  I see noob portfolios on here all day, every day that consist of $5000 divided up into 37 different holdings, mostly of 1 share each.  That will get you nowhere really fast.  Instead pick 1 company, build a position and then and only then buy stock #2.  Scattering your limited assets all over the NASDAQ because you are afraid of missing out, means that you will miss out.  Instead concentrate on 1 stock that you believe in and be patient.  My portfolio is $3/4M and I only own 27 stocks.  But I also own a S&P 500 index fund.  If you want diversification buy mutual funds. \n\nNever stop reading.  Just because you picked wisely or luckily once, twice or three times doesn't make you an expert.  It means you're lucky.  But everyone is an expert in a rising market.  It is those who make money in falling markets who are the smart ones.  \n\nGood luck, you're ahead of the game starting early, don't get behind by playing penny stocks, commodities or high yield junk.  Be smart and don't worry about others, worry about your portfolio and create the best, slow growing, steady earning collection of stocks you can and in 40 years, you'll be glad that you did.", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1597157273.0, "tickers": [["MMM", 3], ["FB", 1]]}

You can mix and match anything, and nothing is 100% one category.  It's always a blend.\n\n* Decide what you want to become:  Do you want to be an investor or a trader?\n   * Investors tend to buy and hold.  Playing the long game (10+ years).\n   * Traders play the short game.\n      * There are day traders and swing traders.  Day traders make several plays each day, and usually don't hold anything into the next trading day.  Swing traders hold longer term looking for the deals.\n* If you want to be an investor, what kind of investor.\n   * Dividend and Growth are the two big basic choices.\n* What your goals are with it.\n   * Retirement?  Look into Roth IRAs or the equivalent.\n   * Steady \"passive\" income?\n   * Something better than a savings account or MMA (Money Management Account), where you can pull money from when you need it?\n* What fields are you familiar with?  What are you interested in?  What do you believe in?\n   * Whatever stock sector you plan on investing in, try to stick to what you know and are willing to do research on.  Think of it as buying a car.  Do your research on the car, the company, and everything concerning it before you put your money into it.  Does the car look good, but it's unreliable and prone to breakdowns?  Maybe put your money into getting something else.  Oh wait, the car looks and runs well?  And has a history to back that up?  But the company is about to declare bankruptcy, so support is going away...\n* Watch videos and look at sites like [SeekingAlpha](https://seekingalpha.com/).  But always take everything with a grain a salt and do your own research.  Just because your favorite youtuber/streamer is talking about Company A a lot doesn't mean it's a good company to invest in.  Everyone has a bias.\n* Consider your investment money as disposable money.  If you can't afford to lose your money, then don't use your money.  Don't put your rent money into it when you need to pay your rent tomorrow.  You only get paid out usually under two conditions:  Dividend payments or you sell your position.  Everything until then is imaginary.  This the difference between unrealized gains and realized gains.\n* Read a lot.  Take a look at different portfolios from this sub and others.  There is no shame in copying others and using what you like and disposing what you don't like.  Back up your choices with your own research.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1597110024.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_iczwsp", "id": "g2b79bd", "text": "This is an excellent question. In my opinion it is always better to take the cash. Generally speaking for small investors (i.e. most individuals here) you are not doing yourself any favors by reinvesting. The reason is because your theoretical goal is to start a meaningful and material *but limited* cash output that doesn't really gain from small and often arbitrary amounts. I'll refer to this as the Netflix Effect Mindset:\n\nLet's say you have a 12% {which is *very* high} stable yield and wish to pay for Netflix with a dividend payment and that Netflix is 13/mo. You buy 110 shares of XYZ @ $10.00 which yields 13.20 per month but costs you $1,100.00 upfront. So, first, let's look at both the ROI and the rationality.\n\nThe ROI would be, in period 1, 13.20/1,100 or 1.2%. Thanks to not very fancy math we can convert this into time; it would take 83 months, or 6.9 *years* to make your money back if all you did was just rely on that return alone. One would argue that this would be reduced by the DRIP but unfortunately if you make such a table it reduces it by less than two months. The rate by which you compound matters here far more than other places because you have no control over the dividend payout schedule (time).\n\nThe rationality is that you're buying the asset with this target goal in mind. So, for $1,100 upfront you could buy, if Netflix did not change price, 7 years worth of the service. This is *important* because that means that your plan is to use a fungible investment return on something that is fixed as a cost. This also suggests that taking the cash is the only thing that makes sense; the prospective risk associated with the stock is significantly higher than the return (read as: you can lose more than $13.20 in a month on the investment itself) and, given it is pre-allocated, there's no reason to deviate.\n\nThis is one of the reasons people suggest not buying stocks for their dividends; I used 12% but many portfolios have less than 5%, so factoring in time, the ROI of the dividend, not the underlying, is usually 25+ years. Time risk is the main risk in any dividend based strategy; for instance if you dripped your returns this year and your stock fell you likely lost more than the whole of your reinvestment; however if you held it as cash, even if unallocated, you could seek returns elsewhere or take advantage of opportunities for higher returns.\n\nBasically if you don't need the money, do invest it, but don't reinvest it to earn .01 on the dollar (and that's the high end). That's just silly.\n\nTL;DR: If you have a $100 dividend a month you'll have an easier time turning it, even at the lowest levels of positive returns, into more cash than you would trying to use a DRiP.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1598003537.0, "tickers": []}

Contribute to an IRA (up to 6,000 per year) and if your company has a 401k matching contribution plan then start doing that and at least match the company’s input, or put in more if you comfortably can. \n\nI would recommend you look carefully at ETFs (exchange traded funds) for your IRA and invest in a few good ones. This simplifies the process for you so you don’t have to study hundreds of companies by yourself. You can pick an ETF by what matches your strategy. If you want to get paid dividends you can get something like SPHD, SPYD, or NOBL. If you want to invest in technology you can buy QQQ, FTEC, ARKK etc. If you want healthcare you can invest in FHLC or something similar, and so on. If you just want to follow the whole US stock market you can buy something like VTI. Some quick google searches will show you plenty of other options. \n\nFor your 401k I recommend buying into a target date mutual fund. In your case it might be a 2055 fund which attempts to invest so you can retire in the year 2055 or whatever target date you choose. These are good because they buy and sell stocks inside the fund without you having to figure it out yourself. They usually pay dividends that get reinvested back into it and it snowballs over time. I’ve have had some target date mutual funds for many years and they have really snowballed over the years and the best part was that I didn’t need to do any research on them. That’s why they charge a small fee to pay the people who do all the work for you. \n\nMy father didn’t really start investing until he was like 40 and even then it took him some years to figure it all out. Eventually, he maxed out all his contributions every year and he invested in some good funds and he did just fine by the time he was in his late 60’s.

{"submission_name": "t3_iizy2t", "id": "g3dtlz3", "text": "> I keep reading dividend is stupid in a taxable account \n\nFor dividends in a taxable account, *the type* of dividend distribution is important to factor in.\n\nIn $QYLD's case, dividends are primarily return of capital (ROC), which is not taxed as income and instead reduces your cost basis. Say you bought 100 shares for $20. A monthly distribution of $0.20 per share is issued and looking up the 19A it is 100% ROC. Instead of paying income tax on $20, the dividend instead reduces your cost basis of the shares which would now be $19.80 per share. You realize no tax until you would sell the shares, ideally down the line at a favorable long term capital gains rate.\n\nFor funds that issue ROC dividends, it is important to pay attention to the funds net asset value (NAV) since it directly relates to share price. Constantly eroding NAV (through outsized dividend payouts) leads to constantly lower share price over time. This is why most people recommend to not chase yield since in most cases it's a trap at the expense of share price. In $QYLD's case however, they have actually grown NAV about 7.5% yearly on average. It lags the index it tracks, but positive NAV growth is still always good to see with such high yields.\n\nMost option writing funds have similar ROC classification on their dividends, but most people don't seem to dig into those details........\n\n\\-Information for reference on the historic distributions:\n\n[https://www.globalxetfs.com/tax-supplements/#qyld](https://www.globalxetfs.com/tax-supplements/#qyld)\n\n TL;DR: $QYLD is actually better in a taxable account over a retirement account because of ROC dividends.", "score": 11, "created_utc": 1598813112.0, "tickers": [["NAV", 3]]}

It's like combining credit cards and the stock market. Horrifying idea, frankly. There's no need for margin if you have thousands to invest. Why be super greedy?\n\nUsing QYLD as a very high yield \"savings account?\" That... is a bit more worthy of discussion. Effectively you get back around 1% of capital a month (minus taxes but savings interest is taxed too), which is far better than any actual savings account. Tech is still doing well and the nature of QYLD has downside protections, at least right now. \n\nLong term? Risky. Short term? I think you could try it. The price action on QYLD is very minimal compared to every other stock I hold. It varies just a few cents up or down a day. Like ten or twelve cents, if that. Trending upward nevertheless.\n\nThat said, SPHD, a similar-in-idea low volatility ETF (it was not based on options) tracking the S&P was used as a faux high yield savings account by some people and it's still quite down from before the covid crash. I invested in them post-crash so I'm okay but anyone holding it before that occurred is still down. The same could happen to QYLD, I suppose.\n\nIf you put 30k in QYLD, earned 1%, then sold everything in a month you'd likely be pleasantly surprised. It's certainly an interesting ETF.\n\nEdit: JEPI is a newer, similar fund based on a different sector. Managed by JP Morgan. Lower yield. Could be safer.

Return on Capital (ROC) distribution -  is a distribution paid to fund shareholders in excess of a fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits. An ROC distribution is generally nontaxable and reduces a shareholder's cost basis in the investment. If an ROC distribution exceeds a shareholder's cost basis, then any additional amount is treated as a capital gain. This happens when a fund or MLP distributes more than they earn which basically returning back to you your own investment %.\n\nIf you invest in a IRA, than your dividends are not taxed until you retire.

{"submission_name": "t3_iv6lud", "id": "g5yzyww", "text": "4 ETFs for Dividend Growth Investors\nby George L Smyth\nThere are ETFs that cover pretty much any groupings one can think of and that includes issues of interest to long term investors. I look at four ETFs that are geared toward the prudent dividend growth investor.\n\nTo understand exchange traded funds (ETFs) one needs to go back to 31 December 1975.  On that date John Bogle opened the First Index Investment Trust, a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500.  Started with just $11 million in assets the fund was called \"un-American\" and referred to as \"Bogle's folly\" by his competitors.  Later renamed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, it crossed the $100 billion milestone by the end of 1999.  Today Vanguard is the largest provider of mutual funds with assets over $5 trillion.\n\nWith the success of what Fidelity Investments Chairman Edward Johnson once referred to as “just average returns,” companies realized that there was money to be made bypassing mutual funds, which can be complicated for the investor and require minimum amounts to participate.  To make things easier for the investor to participate, after some fits and starts, the first ETF to be available in the United States was Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts, or SPDR, which tracks the S&P 500.\n\nWith about 5,000 ETFs globally (1,750 in the U.S.), these instruments offer convenience and affordable exposure to a wide range of investments.  According to etfdb.com there are over 230 dividend ETFs currently being traded in the U.S., so that is a rather large bucket from which to choose.  That said, the prudent dividend investor generally looks for companies with strong dividend growth over a long period of time, so that narrows things down a bit.\n\nWhat I will do is to look at four ETFs that track companies focusing on dividend growth.  After all, we have found that Dividend Champions, Aristocrats, and Kings have done quite well when compared to the S&P 500 Index, so if one is seeking to go the ETF route then it might make sense to find one that tracks one of those lists.\n\nAlas, there are no ETFs that track Dividend Champions or Kings.  Why this is not the case it a mystery to me.  Dividend Champions and Dividend Aristocrats are pretty much the same with the exception that Aristocrats must be listed in the S&P 500 while the Champions do not have that restriction.  We will examine an ETF that follows the former.\n\nAs Dividend Kings need to have offered at least 50 consecutive years of dividend growth there are only 28 companies in the list.  While it seems to me that this could be an extremely low expense ratio ETF, one could make their own ETF by buying all of the companies themselves.\n\nAs this blog and website are geared to the small investor one might wonder how I can make such a suggestion.  After all, we do not have access to the resources for doing this.  One idea might be to copy the companies in the list  and paste them into InvestMete (AWR DOV NWN EMR GPC PG PH MMM CINF JNJ KO LANC LOW FMCB CL NDSN HRL TR ABM CWT FRT SCL SJW SWK TGT CBSH MO SYY), enter any number for the Amount, and click the Determine InvestMete button.\n\nIt will take a little while to process all of them, but when the numbers are displayed sort by InvestMete and buy what you can of those with the highest InvestMete amounts.  My guess is that by purchasing additional shares this way on a regular basis, over the years this dollar cost averaging strategy would eventually include a great many of these companies.  But this is an article about 4 ETFs.\n\nProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF\nNOBL is the best known ETF amongst those who look for dividend growth.  It is the only one to track the S&P 500® Dividend Aristocrats® Index, which consists of companies that have increased their dividend every year for the past 25 years, are members of the S&P 500, and meet certain liquidity requirements (actually, all of the S&P 500 meets these liquidity requirements).  The stocks within this ETF are equally weighted and are rebalanced four times a year.\n\nYield\t5 Year Return\t10 Year Return\tExpense Ratio\n1.94%\t10.86%\tN/A\t0.35%\nSPDR® S&P® Dividend ETF\nSDY tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats (^SPHYDA), which are companies that have increased their dividend for at least 20 consecutive years.  Stocks are weighted within the index by indicated yield and adjusted every quarter.  The dividend growth streak gives the roughly 60 holdings the characteristic of being some of the safest companies and tend toward stable industries.\n\nYield\t5 Year Return\t10 Year Return\tExpense Ratio\n2.52%\t10.53%\t13.02%\t0.35%\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF\n\nVIG tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which contains companies that have increased their dividend over at least the past ten years.  (Disclosure – I recently started a small stake in this ETF.)  REITs are not included in this ETF because they do not receive favorable tax rates from qualified dividends.  About 180 companies comprise the ETF with exposure primarily in the consumer staples, health care, and industrials sectors.\n\nYield\t5 Year Return\t10 Year Return\tExpense Ratio\n1.63%\t12.13%\t12.96%\t0.06%\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\nSCHD, like VIG, contains companies that have increased their dividend for at least the past ten years.  It tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100® Index, excluding REITs, master limited partnerships, preferred stocks and convertibles.  The index is modified market capitalization weighted.  The mix of dividend growth and yield in the roughly 100 companies allow for a greater payout than the above ETFs.\n\nYield\t5 Year Return\t10 Year Return\tExpense Ratio\n3.03%\t11.32%\tN/A\t0.06%\nOf Note\nSDY and VIG have been around since 2006, so they have 10 years of history to report.  Since these ETFs have fairly strict consecutive streak requirements and are passively managed this is really of no advantage over others with less history.\n\nOf definite advantage, however, is the fact that both VIG and SCHD have very low expense ratios.  Expenses can savagely cut into one’s holdings, so having a low expense ratio is an important part of maintaining one’s portfolio.  If a higher expense ratio is to be paid then there should be a strong reason for seeing more money taken out of one’s pocket.\n\nOther Growth Dividend ETFs\nIndeed there are other ETFs that base their selection on dividend growth and this was certainly not intended to be a complete list.  However, they do start to become redundant.  For instance, Invesco Dividend Achievers ETF (PFM), which was mentioned in Dividend Champions, Achievers, Kings and Aristocrats – A Comparison against the Indexes, is nearly the same as the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) with the exception that the former allows REITs and the latter does not.  However, with an expense ratio of 0.54% it does not compare well against VIG.\n\nThere are others, like iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO), that are based on dividend growth but only require a consecutive string of five years, similar to Dividend Challengers.  It does offer an attractive expense ratio of 0.08%, but in my mind such a short streak, while certainly better over the long haul than companies not offering a dividend, is less of a growth streak we would normally seek.\n\nFinishing Up\nWith research one should be able to find other ETFs that better fit their specific requirements.  If one is looking for ETFs that concentrate on dividend growth over a long period of time, any of the above can work well as the cornerstone in one’s portfolio.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1600605981.0, "tickers": [["L", 1], ["DOV", 1], ["NWN", 1], ["EMR", 1], ["GPC", 1], ["PG", 1], ["PH", 1], ["MMM", 1], ["CINF", 1], ["JNJ", 1], ["KO", 1], ["LANC", 1], ["LOW", 1], ["CL", 1], ["NDSN", 1], ["HRL", 1], ["TR", 1], ["ABM", 1], ["CWT", 1], ["FRT", 1], ["SCL", 1], ["SJW", 1], ["SWK", 1], ["TGT", 1], ["CBSH", 1], ["MO", 1]]}

{"submission_name": "t3_iw34z9", "id": "g5wyzyl", "text": "As a beginner, regardless of your sources, I will save you a lot of time during your study with these 7 points:\n\n 1. Pay no respect to volatility of the markets. Who fucking cares about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever the fuck we are on the \"graph\". You should not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, you should not care at all. Volatility should not mean anything to you since you should be a super long-term investor.\n\n 2. You cannot predict the future and you cannot time the market. \"Time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies. Therefore, you should invest as much as you can every time you get paid while while balancing a decent quality of life (whatever that means to you). Basically, don't try to pull off some \"smart shit\" by pulling out your money because you think the markets will crash and then put your money back into the market after it crashes to capitalize on that hypothetical situation in your little head. Turn off your brain and keep your money in the markets because again, \"time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies.\n\n 3. You should consider investing in an \"index exchange traded fund\" or \"index-ETF\" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index-ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors who pick stocks will under perform an index-ETF over the long-term.\n\n 4. Don’t day trade. Don't try to \"get rich quick\". Don't try to \"buy low, sell high\". Don't buy shit/garbage. Don't buy \"meme stocks\". Don't worry about \"missing out\". Build wealth slowly over time as this is a long-term game and not a short-term or medium-term game.\n\n 5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity because everything goes on sale which includes high-quality companies and index-ETFs; and therefore, you get to buy more stuff at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them instead because these are the times which can actually accelerate you towards your financial goals quicker.\n\n 6. Again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics/elections, wars, recessions, poverty, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in buying index-ETFs or purchasing well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until you retire or die.\n\n 7. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks about volatility).\nKeep it simple.

Even better if you're making good investments, which you're more likely to do if you're interesting in the company for more than just their financial statements.   \n\n\nOnce you're more comfortable, which comes quick if you have fun learning and becoming better, start to build a strategy. Maybe read a book on dividend investing, go from there. Odds are, you'll find a rabbit hole one day and end up finding where you're comfortable.   \n\n\nAs for actionable steps:   \n1. Find a good book for beginners, give it a read.   \n2. Invest in some companies you're personally interested in. This will keep you interested.   \n3. Keep learning more, and use the stocks you own as examples for what you're reading/watching. You'll start to see what makes a good and bad investment a bit more clearly.   \n4. Start to develop a strategy. Pick a long term goal, then start figuring out a way to get there. Choose a destination then map out the path.   \n5. Keep learning and adjusting your strategy to more effectively achieve your goals.   \n\n\nAvoid:  \n1. Margin. Do not trade with margin. This is where people get into debt with investing.   \n2. Options, for now. Options can be very useful, especially for more complex strategies, but learn normal investing for now.   \n\n\nGood luck!", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1600572235.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_iwo10z", "id": "g62h0on", "text": "So here's the thing, monthly dividend payers usually have a catch to them. O for example is generally the favorite out there for a monthly dividend. O is also a REIT, which means that A. They make so much money as a real estate holder that they by law have to pass off the majority of the money they earn to the shareholders and B. Because of that it is not a qualified dividend. Qualified Dividends are dividends that are taxed at the Capital Gains rate, which means as long as your total income in a year is under $40,000 you pay nothing on your money earned. After that it's 15% until you're in the hundreds of thousands. On any other dividend you receive, you'll be taxed at your ordinary tax rate, likely 12-22%.  \n\n\nETF's that pay monthly have some sort of catch to them as well. Any ETF that holds Real Estate or Foreign stocks will end up giving you a tax breakdown of what percentage of the dividend has to be sorted into qualified and ordinary dividends. Then there is also a section of ETF's that are actively trading stocks within their portfolio in an attempt to make more money for you, the shareholder, passing along part of whatever profit they make from that. Those will not be qualified.   \n\n\nOn top of all that, it is generally accepted that the majority of monthly payers are foregoing growing in value to pass along money to you the shareholder. You might buy 100 shares of some $5 monthly payer, but in 20 years time it might only rise with inflation and be $10 a share. Double your money, but in 20 years you probably want more than an extra $500 for your investment.   \n\n\nThe basis of dividend investment being successful is the effective use of compounding interest, that is, the more money you can have invested that makes you money, the faster your money can grow. So it is factually accurate that you can make more physical money right off the bat by buying a bunch of small monthly stocks because they will pay you faster. But by doing so you are foregoing the other benefits of investing, because you will be taxed on any dividends received, and the stocks themselves are very unlikely to grow to a number that will serve you in retirement. They are good however for making money in the short term.   \n\n\nSo if you want to invest in monthly payers, I suggest doing so in a ROTH IRA, because any dividends earned will be tax free. On top of that, instead of using those monthly payers to buy more monthly payers, I would recommend using the monthly income to buy shares of better investments. Unless you have a lot of money to mess with I don't recommend having monthly paying stocks in a taxable account, because it's gonna cost you in the short term.", "score": 9, "created_utc": 1600662936.0, "tickers": [["O", 2]]}

You buy a company because it is profitable, its profits are growing, it keeps innovating to keep increasing those profits, it husbands its resources well not buying companies just to get bigger.  You make sure the dividend is sustainable and has a history of increases as the profits grow.  \n\nThe day of the week, month is the least important data set you should review.  This is why I track my dividends by the quarter not the month.  For instance, July and August are my biggest months while September earns about $500 less but what I compare is the 1st quarter to the 2nd quarter.  And the quarters change when I rotate out of one sector into another.  \n\nI earn about $30k a year, what day of the week it pays doesn't matter as most of the dividends are used to buy more stock anyway.  I even out the income by having savings that cover 2 year's worth of expenses.  \n\nBuying a stock just because it pays every month and not knowing what it makes, how profitable it is, is just throwing darts at a chart.

{"submission_name": "t3_j07s4t", "id": "g6qy9ng", "text": "u/diamond393\n\nI start of very simplistic & utilize several different metrics to get a better overall picture. I've been into stocks for about 6 or so months but I've been in research for years so I'm able to quickly go from a broad knowledge, utilize search data and collate several metrics to try to get a more clear picture on broad subjects. Then I'll move to buzz words that I continue to see, cross reference those and then move on to the next bit of more specific information. I've tried to apply this template to dividend stocks & dividend ETFs. (My main investments are listed at the bottom). I tried to figure out my goal. I see that you are like me and looking for primarily growth in stocks but would like dividends as well to build your portfolio overtime which I'm assuming you'd like to eventually convert into monthly income (myself  included).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(\\*Screenshot For Everything below: [https://ibb.co/QXJXqh9](https://ibb.co/QXJXqh9)\n\n1) EXCEL SHEET CREATION\n\n\\- I start with a simplistic Excel sheet. I don't like getting too complicated as I'm not a really experienced trader so I look for stuff that I can compare from stock to stock. P/E and FFO and other things are just too in depth for me to mainly care about at this point. I wanted something I can look at and say hey, that is this and this is slightly better/worse or higher/lower.\n\n\\- I list out the main overall market SYMBOLs for broad market indexes/tradable ETFs: $VTI $SPY $DIA - Through my initial forums/Facebook threads/Reddit research I found these to follow the market and people always suggest these as a base or a set/forget style investment strategy that holds up over long periods of time. I use these as my base comparisons to any potential investments. They are highlighted in GREEN on the screenshot.\n\n\\- Next I just start adding to my Excel sheet. Mainly things you can easily look up and that are fairly compatible in comparing to each other; DIVIDEND YIELD - DIV PER SHARE - PAYOUT FREQUENCY - 5yr GROWTH\n\n\\- I used SeekingAlpha to give me the 3yr DIVIDEND GROWTH RATE - \\*I wanted to use the 5yr but some of them weren't avail.\n\n\\- I added the FREQUECY MULTIPLIER to help with the Potential Growth calculation (getting there below). \\*(12x) = Monthly Div. Payouts -- (4x) = Quarterly Div. Payouts -- (2x) = Semiannual Div Payout -- (1x) = Annual Div Payout\n\n\\- My goal was to try to find my overall yearly growth average and compare that to those 3 main market ETFs: I wanted consistency and something easy to read. I originally was trying to use Google's built in lookup but it didn't give me a good result and I had to hold my mouse down and drag over to measure \"5yrs\".  That was inconsistent. My primary dividend growth/long term investing account is with Robinhood (my other is TD Ameritrade & etrade & Webull).\n\n\\- I went to Robinhood, looked up a symbol, then clicked the button for 5Y. This gave me an easy percent to throw into my \"5yr Growth\" slot on the excel sheet. I went through every symbol to fill in my excel sheet.\n\n\\- Then, I went to the next block and used a quick function to take that 5yr Growth and dividend by 5yrs to give the general 1yr growth average. \\*Remember, I'm long in the market so I'm just looking for averages overall, not exactly what happened. I just want to see easy to read numbers to help me look for stocks.\n\n\\- I wanted to account for the dividend yield in some way so I made the POTENTIAL 5yr GROWTH. Using a quick function I took the \\[DIVIDEND YIELD (x) FREQ MULTIPLIER\\] to get about the %-yield for 5yrs. Then Took that number and added it to the \"5yr Growth\" slot. This became the 5yr POTENTIAL GROWTH. Then I took that and made another column to get the 1yr average.\n\nLimitation of Calculation:\n\n1. Simplistic\n2. Does NOT Account For DRIP/Compounding\n\n\\- As you can see this gave me a LOT of data to look at in general. I know there is much more specific stuff you can look into but I really wanted simplistic overviews to make quicker choices. I don't want to spend hours & days on things, especially since hospital work and a daughter take a lot of my free time already.\n\n\\- I start sorting the data. I sort by high to low or however the category is. I first started with the 3yr dividend growth rate. I highlighted everything that was higher than the VTI (lowest but most broad market fund).\n\n\\- Then sorted the base 5yr growth and highlighted everything that was larger than VTI. I did the same for all the categories on growth. \\*As you can see, some of the Potential growths are larger than the base growth when adding in the dividend yields. This is exactly why I wanted to make that simplistic calculation despite the limitations. This doesn't even account for the overall potential earnings when fractionally reinvesting through DRIP or the compounding that occurs every payout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) FURTHER RESEARCH\n\n\\- After utilizing basic data from the excel sheet and finding some interesting holdings I'll go into my TD Ameritrade account. It has some of the most market analyst ratings you can find. Typically the Morningstar rating along with a ton of others. This really makes it easy to see how well each fund is respected. There is also a fairly neat comparison tool you can use to compare different ETFs or find some that are similar to the one you have in mind.\n\n\\- If it looks good to me I'll look into buying some shares. I usually will buy shares and then on the days when I get some money, I'll bolster the tickers I see are up the least amount or in last weeks case, down the furthest hah!! If there is a quarterly Ex-Div date coming up I'll usually use that free cash on hand to bolster that particular fund. You'll get more realized gains that way quicker. A good strategy is having a good mix of monthly & quarterly payers. DRIP the monthly ones, but use the dividends from the quarterly payers to buy more of the next upcoming symbol that is going Ex-Div 1st. That way you continually have quicker \"realized gains\" as opposed to using that money to put into something that isn't going to payout again for another 3-months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) RESEARCH PLACES\n\n\\- These are where I usually try to find decent ETFs or a good ETF screen/research/etc.\n\n1. ETF Overlap: ETFRC --> ETF Tools --> Fund Overlap\n2. ETF Screener: ETFDB / DIVIDEND(.)COM / FINVIZ (One of the best free tools ever!) / Fidelity\n3. General Info: SeekingAlpha / Dividend (.) com\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) RATINGS USED TYPICALLY\n\n\\- These are the ratings I usually use when seeing if I really want to invest in those funds. I used TD Ameritrade & Webull a lot to see ratings. These free accounts make great research tools.\n\n1. Morningstar (TD Ameritrade & Webull)\n2. Zacks\n3. Lipper Leader\n4. Random TD Ameritrade Ratings (Lots of goodies to use & read - Get a free account just for that alone, totally worth it!)\n5. Reddit/Facebook Group comment overlapping recommendations. I ALWAYS use the search button for things like \"Best growth\" / \"SPHD\" or something and see what comments pop up. You can't beat people who really try to explain it in plain english what is going on with the stock and why it's good/bad. Use people's knowledge but DO NOT RELY ON IT. DO YOUR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) MY GENERAL PORTFOLIO \\*I am NOT a financial advisor.\n\n\\- These are my long holdings. I have a few play ones but those are throw aways I wouldn't recommend. Mainly Future bets to play with.\n\n* $DGRO $DGRW $FTEC $IWY $O $PBW $PEY $SMH $SPHD $SPLV $STAG $STOR $VUG\n\n\\- Once you start getting into the 10s of thousands in holdings, start to evaluate the EXPENSE RATIO as well. This is kind of a yearly \"fee\". It can make a difference on large accounts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Wow, this turned into a REALLY long hr long write up. I hope this helps. I know it feels like a tangent but going by one single rating isn't worth it. You really need to evaluate stocks on several different components or at least a couple different ratings.", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1601164742.0, "tickers": [["TD", 4], ["FREQ", 1], ["O", 1], ["STAG", 1], ["STOR", 1]]}

I started a position and would keep plunking money into that company until I had invested $5,000, only then would I buy stock number 2.  \n\nFor the first 15 years I DRIPed everything but then I started considering why wait 3 months to see the results of my dividend being reinvested.  So I started taking the dividends in cash and would use them to buy more of one the the stocks I already owned.\n\nWhy the change?  Well if I DRIP, I see the result of my additional investment in 3 months when I get the next dividend.  I also am not choosing the price I am paying because the process is automated.  So I started taking the dividends in cash and bought whichever stock was going ex-dividend the soonest and was in the low end of its normal trading range.  This way I am choosing the price I pay and I see the results in a month instead of 3 months.  \n\nToday I am retired and take in about $30,000 a year in dividends.  I  take about $24,000 in sales out of my taxable account each to supplement my Social Security.  I feel safe knowing that I am taking in more than I am spending each year.\n\nIt takes a long time before you see the payoff.  Buying just 1.237 shares with your DRIP each quarter isn't very exciting.  Eventually you get to where you are buying 4.583 shares and one day, you have $2000 a month to spend.  \n\nI hope some of you will avoid wasting time and money chasing yields as I did early on and figure out sooner than I did that buying for the dividend without understanding the company that is paying it, is foolhardy.", "score": 106, "created_utc": 1601321775.0, "tickers": []}
{"submission_name": "t3_j1h96r", "id": "g6zetaw", "text": "I got the idea of dividend investing from my grandfather (in an indirect way).  He was the most frugal man on planet earth, living significantly below his means.  He was also kinda (definitely) a cheapskate.  He was a decent man and hated the thought of paying too much for things. One of the biggest pet peeves in his life was the thought of paying someone to make money for you.  He started telling me when I was six to always remember to invest in no-load assets.  Six-year-old me had absolutely zero clue what that meant, but I still remember it to this day because he mentioned it every time child me went over and stayed the night.\n\nBeing from rural Kentucky pre-internet, my grandfather did not have many options for brokerage services.  Every option he did have charged absolutely insane fees, which my grandfather considered a death penalty offense.  I did not learn this until a few years before his death, but the way he invested is unlike probably anyone in the modern day.\n\nMy grandfather would write letters to large, publicly traded companies and just ask to buy stock directly from them.  Skip the stock exchanges, brokerages, and commissions.  He just wrote letters.  That was apparently something you could do back then (many companies still allow it today).  The interesting part is that he flatly refused to pay a fee of any kind.  He would actually haggle and negotiate via letter to get zero fees.\n\nMy favorite interaction was how he got invested in Ford back in 1962.  He started by writing the company directly.  For some reason, he never heard back.  So he wrote either the company or the SEC and somehow got the past 15 years of annual reports.  I'm not sure if he paid for them or not, but somehow he got them.  He read through them and found one line in one report that mentioned in passing a particular executive had been with the company for 35 years.  My grandfather reasons (with 0 evidence) this executive is likely nearing retirement and may be willing to offload a few shares.  So my grandfather somehow gets his hands on a phone book for the Detroit Metro Area and writes a letter to everyone with the same name.  He eventually reaches the executive who actually writes back.  Turns out the executive had been mulling retirement the very next year, and had not even told his wife.  Long story short, my grandfather and the Ford executive exchange correspondence, and arranged a sale to take place one week after his retirement sometime in either 1963 or 1964.  I wish I could tell you the executive's name, but my grandfather lost most of his paper records back in the early 80s in a fire, with his unexpected death robbing our family of the ability to find out this information.  My mom and aunt still jointly hold the shares though.  As they are not connected to any brokerage or investment account, they still got paper dividend checks up until Ford suspended their dividend earlier this year.", "score": 96, "created_utc": 1601320174.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_j2u8xu", "id": "g77xif6", "text": "Here are some more general guidelines which I sincerely believe that everyone should have ingrained in their heads when formulating their personal strategy:\n\n1. Pay no respect to volatility of the markets. Who fucking cares about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever the fuck we are on the \"graph\". You should not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, you should not care at all. Volatility should not mean anything to you since you should be a super long-term investor.\n2. You cannot predict the future and you cannot time the market. \"Time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies. Therefore, you should invest as much as you can every time you get paid while while balancing a decent quality of life (whatever that means to you). Basically, don't try to pull off some \"smart shit\" by pulling out your money because you think the markets will crash and then put your money back into the market after it crashes to capitalize on that hypothetical situation in your little head. Turn off your brain and keep your money in the markets because again, \"time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies.\n3. You should consider investing in an \"index exchange traded fund\" or \"index-ETF\" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index-ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors who pick stocks will under perform an index-ETF over the long-term.\n4. Don’t day trade. Don't try to \"get rich quick\". Don't try to \"buy low, sell high\". Don't buy shit/garbage. Don't buy \"meme stocks\". Don't worry about \"missing out\". Build wealth slowly over time as this is a long-term game and not a short-term or medium-term game.\n5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity because everything goes on sale which includes high-quality companies and index-ETFs; and therefore, you get to buy more stuff at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them instead because these are the times which can actually accelerate you towards your financial goals quicker.\n6. Again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics/elections, wars, recessions, poverty, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in buying index-ETFs or purchasing well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until you retire or die.\n7. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks about volatility).\n\nKeep it simple. Keep yourself disciplined. Keep hustling. Keep your money. Good luck with personal finance and investing! =)", "score": 58, "created_utc": 1601500156.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_j4fyz7", "id": "g7j0dnc", "text": "Utilities.   I have been stocking up on utilities in the last couple of months.  It is easy to find some with 3%, even greater than 4% yields.  And while these are slow growing companies, they are very safe government regulated entities that compound effectively over time.  Here is a list of the utility stocks I own, many of which I have initiated or added to recently:\n\nTicker-   Current yield-- 5 year dividend CAGR.\n\nAES    -   3.1            ---        22.5\n\nAWK   -   1.5            ---        10.1\n\nAQN    -   4.2              ---        6.0\n\nDUK     -  4.2         ---             3.5\n\nDTE     -   3.6             ---         7.4\n\nED     -     3.8           ---           3.3  \n\nNEE      -  2.0             ---       11.5\n\nOGE    -    5.2             ---         9.9\n\nPOR     -   4.5          ---            6.4\n\nSO      -    4.6             ---          3.4\n\nAES has a credit rating of only BB+, so I will not add to this position again, atleast until it rises to BBB+.\n\nI particularly like stocks that have yields approaching 5%, with CAGR also approaching 5%.  Admittedly, these are hard to find.  But I believe that the utilities sector is a great place to find safe, secure dividend payers that make excellent long term investments.  So called \"widows and orphan's stocks\". The kind that you rarely need to monitor, but can retire on and never sell.\n\nCAGR stands for compound annual growth rate.  It reflects how quickly a company grows its dividends over time.  Let's take NEE for example.  While it's current yield is a relatively low 2%, its CAGR is high at 11.5 %.  If we compare that to SO which has a higher yield of 4.6%, but a lower CAGR of 3.4 % we can predict what the yield on \nCost (YOC) might be over time:\n\nYear   -  NEE    --- SO\n\n1       ---    2.0     --- 4.6                 \n2        ---   2.2     --- 4.8  \n3       ---    2.5     --- 4.9         \n4        ---   2.8    ---  5.1         \n5      ---     3.1   ---   5.3      \n6       ---    3.5   ---   5.4            \n7       ---    3.8 ---     5.6              \n8       ---    4.3   ---   5.8           \n9       ---    4.8    ---  6.0         \n10     ---    5.3  ---    6.2         \n11      ---   5.9    ---  6.4        \n12      ---   6.6   ---   6.6       \n13      ---   7.4  ---    6.9             \n14   ---      8.2 ---     7.1            \n15     ---    9.2    ---  7.4        \n16    ---   10.2    ---  7.6       \n17    ---   11.4    ---  7.9          \n18    ---   12.7   ---   8.1           \n19    ---   14.2     --- 8.4      \n20     ---  15.8    ---  8.7\n\nIn other words, a $100 investment in each company would theoretically pay you 20 years from now:\n\nNEE   $15.80/year\n\nSO        $8.70/year  \n\nNow will NEE be able to maintain a 10% growth rate every year for 20 years?  Probably not.  But it has been growing faster than nearly every other utility for quite a few years now.  That's why it's more expensive and its yield is lower than most of the other utilities. \n\nAnyway, utilities are the companies I have been focusing on lately.  Likely safe, even when the overall economy is uncertain.  Most everyone wants to keep the lights on, the water flowing, and the house warm.  And with prices overall good right now, I think this is a good time to pick some up.\n\nSource for the data presented:  seekingalpha.com\n\nComment edited in an effort to make the tables more readable.", "score": 9, "created_utc": 1601743619.0, "tickers": [["NEE", 3]]}

This is what I consider to be a goldilocks zone of yield.  \n\nThe important thing to remember though, is that yield chasing is never a good idea under any  circumstances.  Because when you get burned, you tend to get burned simultaneously and irreparably.  \n\nIf you look at my portfolio's performance through 2020, if you judged the portfolio solely by raw dividend returns taken in, 2020 actually will see a net **increase** in dividend income for me.    Even if I had not put in a penny through all of 2020, my dividend income would increase.\n\n5 companies either reduced or eliminated their dividend due to the coronavirus.  However, 33 companies increased their dividend at some point in 2020 so far.  \n\nI project four companies will increase their dividends still this year based upon prior year trends.  They just haven't announced their Q4 dividend yet. (Visa, Union Pacific, Broadcom, and Merck)\n\nI know for a fact JP Morgan and Bank of America will maintain a stagnant dividend in 2020 due to the ban imposed by the government on the largest US banks raising dividends in 2020.  \n\nThe only stock I am unsure about is Stock Yards Bancorp.  I cannot remember off the top of my head if they are large enough to be under that prohibition on banks raising their dividend for 2020.  What I do know is that the company has never cut their dividend since the company went public some time in the 80s or 90s, and management is honestly the best I have ever seen of any bank, so I am not worried in the slightest.  In fact, I have been buying massive amounts of this company the past month or so.  Stock Yards derives over 80% of its revenue from clients in the Louisville, Kentucky Metro Area.  Although it is making massive efforts to diversity the geography of its revenue in recent years, all that Breonna Taylor action and anxiety imploded the stock, causing it to drop by 22% in the three weeks prior to the grand jury verdict.  I guess because people thought protesters were going to burn the company's headquarters or something.  Either way, the company's revenues and branch locations are still doing just fine, so I am not worried about dividend being cut.\n\nThis is the kind of action I want from my portfolio, and why I love dividend growth investing.  I could not care less about the raw dollar price of the stock.  It can do summersaults in the air and I will not bat an eye.  I have been invested for a while, and so my yield on cost was (last I calculated) somewhere in the realm of 5.7% or so, which is absolute insanity.  It is also why I never need to worry or lose sleep about timing the market.  Everything is fine.

Just make sure it’s in a separate account and to only trade at your current level of risk tolerance for a given account. \n\nObviously there’s a ton of ways to trade options, but I feel like that is a good place to start, given that every other sub about investing is basically WSB, I was almost hesitant to mention, but a lot of active traders generally manage multiple portfolios. just make sure the bulk of your money is in the lowest risk ones first and the smallest amount of money is in the highest risk and trim accordingly based on your personal risk tolerance.

As other posts have commented, you lose control of your entry price and often times it erodes your cost on yield.

Starbucks for example has quarterly dividend at $0.45c right now.  I have 200 shares myself because of my savings over time this last...6 months ish.\n\nPoint is I think from the payout being 100% from some if not most of your holds I'd just say you will be better off with what I believe is a more stable and secure stock like SBUX.  Sure I'm biased too but I do objectively feel that they have raised their dividend over 3 years from about 30c to now 45c.  SBUX is not an aristocrat stock fine and not a REIT sure but it's got a good solid history and it's not super expensive like NVDA.\n\nNVDA fyi is a dividend stock too if you're interested in other dividend stocks....but it's much less than SBUX so I'd say don't save up for NVDA's even if you are a gamer...the dividend is 16c per share vs SBUX it's 45c per share however SBUX is easier to get 10 shares.\n\nAnother comparison I like to draw is the payout ratio I mentioned above..but I'd like to get more in depth and I hope I can be of help saying this - look at this:  \nIVR  payout ratio= 10.42% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings) and consider this 333.33% (Based on This Year's Estimates) \\*\\*\\*all sourced from [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/IVR/dividend/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/IVR/dividend/))\n\n  \n\\~\\~PSEC payout ratio=  100.00% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings)   \n\\~\\~IRM payout ratio= 107.86% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings)  \n\\~\\~SBUX payout ratio=  57.95% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings)   \n\\~\\~NVDA payout ratio=   13.94% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings) \n\nI won't go more into that but I think that should indicate they are paying all they make back to you the investors...which I doubt/don't think this would last 10 years....or just very long.\n\n**All in all, I'd say these will not provide long term substantial growth of your dividend stock portfolio.  Choose others that have a \"ceiling\" of 50% payout ratio.

{"submission_name": "t3_jr1cif", "id": "gbx8s11", "text": "I was taught something very different than I discovered to be true. What struck me is that you want to retire at 55, and implement an income investment strategy as part of your achieving that goal. \n\nIronically, I recently read, that in the US, a retirement literacy test was given to a broad cross section of ages and income levels. Something like, 84% failed horribly. The question missed frequently across all groups was life expectancy. People live a lot longer than they used to, and with the near exponential growth in innovation that will ultimately (imo) prove longstanding and widely adopted strategies. The 60/40 growth/income portfolio for example. Even before the virus altered the financial landscape, there were was a recent period when Bonds weren’t functioning as a hedge against the drop of the Portfolio’s 40% equity allotment. \n\nDo you have enough to live comfortably, assuming the trajectory you’ve mapped out succeeds if you live 10 years longer than you think you will? \n\nRay Dalio (Bridgewater and assoc), and Cathy Woods from Ark Invest are two of my “gurus”. I’m 38, and aside from investing done on my behalf as a child to help pay for college, I did not personally trade or invest until March 2019. I love every part of it. Of all the material I’ve poured through, not once did I hear about any successful strategies involving 50 income yielding stocks working out for us borderline millennials :) \n\nI have had the best luck with maintaining 5 primary accounts, each with a different strategy. Grow stocks are what will most likely get you the returns needed for a long retirement (imo), but they are riskier and volatile. \n\nHence, the 2nd account is to protect my assets from a sudden drop, like we saw in March. Ray Dario’s Risk Parity aka Pure Alpha fund has been my most rewarding account. Based on my age I did adjust the weightings toward equities, not by more than 3-5 % depending on when I rebalance. It’s a fantastic theory. Basically the 60/40 many baby boomers were pushed into by their brokers doesn’t take account for the inherent weighting of risks that equities have. So it raises the question: is adjusting the allotment to 40% enough to reduce risk relative to the 60% of Bonds? \n\nDalio found the following to get a very balanced weighting across across a more diverse portfolio . From my experience, if it is ever down for the day when a significant drop occurs, it’s by less than a point, and moreover, it yields a consistent 15–17%. I don’t know all the rules in the group here, so I won’t mention the specific institution I use, but it is one that makes rebalancing the simplest process imaginable. \n-20% equities \n-40% Long term bonds \n-10% medium duration bonds \n-7.5% gold \n\nAs to be expected, when looking at his hedge fund’s required filings for anything over 10,000, foreign companies and ETF’s had replaced the bonds. As he said on tv, cash is trash. At near 0% interest rates in the us, when you factor inflation in, it’s like paying to lose your money slowly lol. I found a basic version of it and had this specific bundle until Covid: \n10 %Vanguard’s growth geared s&p 500 etf \n10 % Vanguard total stock market etf\n40 %I shares 40 plus years US treasury bond etf\n10% I shares 10 year US treasury bonds etf\n7.5% SPDR’s gold etf \n7.5% The investco commodities etf. \n\n401k and Roth IRA (for mutual funds, and I don’t manage the 401k)\n\nA robo account to protect against any other subconscious bias or emotion when decision making on the ones I manage, and lastly...a brokerage account for trading options contracts and short term high yield stock plays. \n\nWoods’s ark invest has 5-7 managed ETF’s, actively managed and transparent. They post their daily purchases and sells. And she does great YouTube market updates. All investments are premised on the notion that they are so innovative and disruptive that they will average a 15% ROI, which results in a doubling of initial investment after 5 years! People called her crazy when ARK invested so much in Tesla it became their largest position. \n\nLastly, Ray Dalio says playing the market is like betting. Bet a little here, a little there, and you have a better chance of walking out with something than letting it all ride on bet. My stolen advice is to devise a more diverse strategy that involves as many uncorrelated bets as you can to accomplish your goals. \n++Many High Growth stalls pay a high dividend, so you get income there too. The income I generate day to day is from playing in the options market. Just started reading up on it and while I’ve heard people say it’s too risky, when you do the research, have your own strategy, and have confidence you have a pulse on whether a stock will increase, decrease, or stay flat, then for a lot less money you can turn a quick profit, go long and buy out of the money call options because you know down the road the respective stock will be above the chosen strike price. \n\nBest of luck, sorry for the novel, I relate to getting started late and it took a lot of research to structure my investments, but I personally love doing it. If you want to reap dividends from well established companies and reinvest them so it’s growing in shares w/out checking the market 10 times during trading hours, more power to you!\n\nNow \n-7.5% commodities", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1605089941.0, "tickers": []}

These dividend paying ETFs typically have lower dividends (<1% usually) so I always say add a good \"dividend growth\" stock or ETF in there (like DGRO/DGRW/VIG/ etc..). Consistent dividend growth should be prioritized along with good companies. I wouldn't call it a secret as it's usually touched on dividend investing guides/books/PDFs/etc. Look for stocks that yield at least 2.5% with a dividend growth % over the last few years of at least 7% (you can look up stocks on seekingalpha and then click dividends --> dividend growth). This will double your money in approx 10 years on the dividend growth alone, regardless of how much the stock appreciates. Avoid most dividend stocks >6 or 7% yield unless you are retired and don't care about 0% growth in the stock, just the dividend. You can usually find some great reliable/high quality stocks with yields between 2.5-5%. Any higher and usually there is negligible growth appreciation (sideways trader) so all of your earnings come only from the dividends and not by selling them eventually for profits.\n\nCheck out the dividend Aristocrat list, and the dividend contenders/challengers/champions list as well.  \n\n\n\\*\\*And to somewhat answer your original post haha:\n\nusually stocks will announce their upcoming dividend sometime before. Sometimes for monthly paying stocks they will announce the next 3 dividends (for that quarter).

Remember if you utilize DRIP auto reinvesting from the payout, that amount of dividend you get on the next payout will be slightly higher, then the next will be slightly higher and so on-so forth.

{"submission_name": "t3_jtf6fy", "id": "gc67suc", "text": ">From what I understand, dividend investing is like buying a piece of a company, that will pay me out monthly/ yearly dividends. This appeals to me a lot more than buying stocks because until you actually withdraw money from a stock it’s not real money, and as soon as you do, there’s the opportunity cost to consider.\n\nDividend investing is still buying stocks. Or you buy an etf or mutual fund, which is just a basket full of stocks that you can buy.\n\nThere are two basic ways that stocks return value to you as a shareholder. \n\n* They can go up in price (called capital appreciation, or capital gains). This is common with companies that choose to reinvest all of their profits into the company, or who issue stock buybacks.\n* They can take some or all of their profits and return it to shareholders directly as a dividend payment. This means less money is being reinvested into the company, since some of the profit is being returned to shareholders directly.\n\nBoth of them are good.\n\n>what’s the best platform to buy dividends on?\n\nAs mentioned, you don't buy \"dividends\", you buy dividend yielding stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds.\n\nPersonally, I use several platforms. I think the best for buy and hold dividend investing is M1 finance. You set up a \"pie\" of stocks you want to purchase, then you set up periodic investments, and it will buy fractional shares of stocks based on the ratio you set up.\n\n>What dividends would ye recommend to start off on\n\nDriving it home again - you don't buy dividends, you buy dividend yielding securities.\n\nPersonally, I would start with index etfs like VTI, or stick with the [dividend aristocrats](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-aristocrats/).\n\n>Website/ subreddits/ news sources for further study\n\nIf you are this new, I'd recommend getting your legs under you. /r/personalfinance, /r/investing, /r/financialindependence are all good. Also read \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" and Bogle's \"Little Book of Common Sense Investing\".\n\n>How much monthly investment and for how long would return dividends of, say, $10 a month? All help is much appreciated!\n\nThat depends entirely on your choice of security. Suppose you chose VTI. \n\n$10 a month \\* 12 months in a year = $120 per year\n\nVTI seems to average about a $.65 distribution every quarter. There's 4 quarters in a year, so that's .65\\*4 = $2.60 average dividends per share per year. So, $120 per year goal / $2.60 per year per share = 47 shares of VTI you would need to buy. At today's prices, that would be $**8570.45.**\n\nAssuming you are investing $100 per week and prices never change, it will take you about 86 weeks (8570/100) to get there.\n\nNow suppose you chose VYM. Current price, $87.49. Quarterly distribution averaging around $.65 per share, again, about $2.60 per year. So, $120/$2.60 again gives us 47 shares, this time of VYM. Meaning an investment of **4112.97**. At $100 per week, assuming prices never move, that's 42 weeks.\n\nBoth roads get you there, and there are pros and cons for both approaches. But that takes time and experience. Just stay away from the siren song of 10+% dividend yields. They can burn you pretty badly.\n\nNow, one other thing to consider on all of this is taxes.

The convenience factor of seeing a Chase/Santander/etc in every state is rather comforting.\n\n\\- Products: Banks can usually offer more, both investment product wise and instrument-wise (business credit cards/business loans) . More doesnt always mean better, but I like seeing my options.\n\n\\- Non-exclusivity- Banks dont typically have a \"field of membership\" like Credit unions do. Credit unions want to limit their customer base. AKA typically region or community limited\n\n\\- Mobile apps, ATMs, etc. Big banks will often have better mobile applications.

The specific brands are not broken down in the shareholder report but by inference I'd guess MtG is by far their most valuable franchise.\n\nHasbro has the stated goal of [doubling revenue from MtG](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/j7czsn/hasbro_goal_double_wotc_revenue_will_this_destroy/) over the next 5 years. The game has a large, committed global player base with a lot of stickiness but people are becoming worried.\n\nHasbro's growth strategy involves an increasing pace of new product releases, more premium/foil/fancy cards to appeal to whales, and so on to better and better monetize from this committed base of players. However, perception of corporate management by the player base is steadily declining: support for competitive formats is dropping, controversial design decisions for the most popular formats leading to poor balance and frequent banning of cards, move toward a digital platform when the game has previously been all face-to-face, etc. \n\nI'm trying to keep this as objective as possible and so someone not part of this community can get the issue, but basically many MtG players are getting increasingly pissed at how hard this franchise is being monetized. \n\nThere's also an implicit competitor to Hasbro's MtG card production which are fake, counterfeit cards produced in China which are much cheaper and becoming increasingly good at imitating the real thing.\n\nHasbro is already at an over 75% payout ratio on dividends. They also have a pretty high amount of debt. A significant risk factor to the company's future is that milking this beloved franchise will blow up in their faces. And I don't see My Little Pony or Transformers suddenly stepping in to replace that revenue.\n\nTLDR from the customer side, Hasbro appears to be mismanaging one of their most valuable segments currently and I could see it really blowing up in their face 3-5 years down the road.", "score": 11, "created_utc": 1606018454.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_jz1ds0", "id": "gd9bfoa", "text": "I was on the same boat as you, but then I realized I could have a more stable and larger income with the same investment using options. \n\nMy strategy is \"The Wheel\" or \"Triple Income investing\" (which I've modified to be Pentuple income investing). \n\nI'll break down as simple as possible for those new to the concept. \n\nI pick a stock that has a dividend pay out that I wouldn't mind holding. Then I sell a \"Cash Covered Put\" what this is, is essentially me going to someone with 100 shares of the stock and saying \"Hey your stock is gonna go up\" and they say \"I'm not so sure\". So I sell them insurance. They pay a \"Premium\" and if the stock falls below the \"Strike Price\" we agree on, I HAVE to buy the shares at the strike price, regardless of how low it goes. Now if it doesn't go below the strike price, I keep the premium, they keep the shares.\n\nThe goal in this first step is to NOT get assigned the shares, so you tend to be conservative with the put. However, with $5k cash on hand, you can expect around $100 in premium per week playing relatively safe puts. You're never going to get a dividend return like that. \n\nNow, IF I lose (and it does happen) I will be assigned the shares. Oh well. I overpaid for some stock, hopefully not by a lot. (Remember I have to buy regardless of how low it goes). Now that I have the stock, I can eat the loss and start again, or I can do the second step of the wheel. \n\nStep 2: I use those shares to sell a \"Covered Call\". This is where I go to someone who wants to BUY 100 shares of the stock I hold, and they think it's gonna go up by a lot. I say \"Ya right\" and then sell them the opportunity to buy the shares at a lower strike price than they think it will get to. They pay me a premium for this opportunity. \n\nOnce again, if the shares reach above the strike price, I am obligated to sell them at the strike price, regardless of how high it goes. If the shares do not reach the strike when the contract expires, I keep them and the premium. \n\nThe goal again can be to sell or not sell depending on how much I like the stock. \n\nOnce I'm wrong on this part of the wheel, I sell the shares at the strike price, which is ideally more than I paid in the first step. Meaning I got premium from Step 1 and Step 2 and then income from the sale in the call. AKA - Triple income. \n\nHow I modify it is pretty simple. I pick stocks that pay dividends. When the Ex date is coming up, I make the goal to get assigned or keep the shares, so I can collect the dividend payment as well as premium. (That's income source 4). \n\nThen I take all premium and gains and use them to invest into \"Safe Bet\" dividend payers - (Income source 5). \n\n\nIt is much riskier than playing the dividend game, but if you're young and have time to bounce back from a loss - and of course you don't use ALL your money to play this strategy, you should theoretically come out ahead more times than you lose. You'll be able to collect a pretty decent amount weekly, and over time build positions much, much faster. \n\nThe downside - If an event like march happens, you're going to lose BIG, but at the end of the day, for better or worse, you'll still get assigned some shares of stock. So long as the company does not go out of business, you'll live to fight another day - and let's be real if you were holding dividend stocks during an event like covid crash you were gonna lose big anyway.", "score": 76, "created_utc": 1606077301.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_k1kc72", "id": "gdpithq", "text": "I’ve seen a lot of good explanations here already, but I’ll throw another one in there. I’m trying to r/ELI5 this a bit for simplicity’s sake. I’m sure you know most of the details already, but sometimes helps to reimagine them.\n\nObviously, living off dividends vs. living of selling stocks are both perfectly viable strategies. Dividend investors typically choose that route for exactly the reasons you described, and it’s a very viable strategy that works for millions of people.\n\nBut a really important consideration is that you can’t focus exclusively on the finished product. Of course any investor, of any strategy, would prefer not to sell anything from their portfolio. But they accept that manner of income because they believe they will get better returns.\n\nSo if, right now, a genie is offering a retiree a $2,000,000 dividend portfolio or a $2,000,000 growt-stocks portfolio. It would be sensible to take the dividends because they didn’t need to work harder/longer for it. But If yo’re starting from scratch, it might take longer to get to the Crossover point for a dividend investor than it would for a growth investor.\n\nTo that end, I think the answer to your question “why would I want to keep selling shares for income instead of dividends” is: because it has the potential to grow faster and get to the magic retirement value sooner than DRIP investing would.\n\nRemember, when selling stocks, investors often aim to sell off in an amount that appreciation will make back. So the value of the account might not even change by the end or each year (assuming the Crossover point model for generational investing, not a solo-retiree who might be okay deplete their savings). \n\nAnd while it might be weird to visualize. Consider the law of large numbers. If it takes me 100 stock sales a month to fund my lifestyle, and I have 400,000 stocks,  I’m not going to be particularly worried about “running out”. Especially because next year those 398,800 stocks might be worth the same amount as 400,000 stocks were worth the year before.\n\nIt’s a weird thought experiment, but separate the concept of “number of stocks” from “value of portfolio”. If your portfolio has enough money in it to retire, or (if you want to pass it on for generations) enough money in it to keep growing faster than you’re spending it, then the number of stocks doesn’t matter until it’s 0. And when you use only tiny fractions of the account (law of large numbers, so to speak), that’s essentially never.\n\nSo the growth investor is betting that their growth stocks and ETFs will reach that magic retirement number faster than DRIP investors. They might be right or they might be wrong. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future success. But it has been that way before, and they’re banking on it happening again.\n\nRegardless of the investment strategy, both groups hope to find a medium where the returns (either by dividends or equity selloff) will replenish. And most groups usually have similar success in that regard", "score": 21, "created_utc": 1606429074.0, "tickers": []}

Definitely missed out on money not doing growth.\n\nI kept all my dividend stocks though - so I have a mix of both. I get about $12k in dividends a year, I no longer drip that. I take the dividends and throw it into growth stocks as well as my contributions.\n\nWhen I retire and there is a market downturn and my dividend stocks keep paying I don't have to sell off as much for that year or two. So the dividends will help some.\n\nAs to your question - if you pick good stocks of EFT - and they grow a lot it is better than div stocks.\n\nLets give an example not based in real stocks or numbers - but this is what i saw.\n\nI was putting say 10k in dividen stocks. and they were returning around $900 a year in dividends. I was using drip so it would get reinvested back in. In 6 years time I was still getting around $1,100 in divdends a year from this one investment and I was worth about $13k after 6 years. So I gained $3k\n\nHad I put that same $10k into say vtsax I think was at $42 a share, 6 years later the value would be at $21,000. More than double what I put in.   I could sell off $8,000 in that stock and still be right at where the dividend stock is (even with drip).  Now if you can get a mix of dividend stock that also grows - great like O. But even with O had I put 10k in O with drip 6 years ago and $10k in vtsax, I would have more money with vtsax.\n\nSo in a growth stock or fund, hopefully you get a decent rate of return. By the time you are ready to sell you money is 3-4 times as much as you put in. As you slowly sell that stock off the value should keep going up year after year. so you pick an amount to sell off every year to stretch going to zero for say 30 years or so.\n\nAnd there is no grantee a dividend stock won't cut a dividend or stop paying a dividend. Both have happened to a few of my dividend stocks this year.\n\nI do still like dividend stocks but I no longer buy them. That $12k a year I make from dividends go for growth stocks.

(TSLA, PLTR, NIO, etc..).\n \n  You've got your cool, fun loving crowd that keeps \nyou on your toes (FAANG, etc...). \n \n  Then theres your every day, average joe crowd that nobody has beef with but aren't overly excited to have there either (JNJ, MMM, LMT, etc...). \n  \n  Finally there are the wallflowers, nerds and weirdos. This crowd is either ostracized, ignored or simply hated (GIS, MO, T, HSY, CPB, etc...). Some of them just don't make themselves noticed, some of them aren't trendy enough to hang with and seem out of touch with the theme of the party. Others are simply hated and are picked on and pushed around.\n\nThe point of all of this is to ask yourself one question.\n\nYou are the owner of the house, it's your party. Who's getting invited and why?\n\n Do you want to have an extravagant party with the most wild, popular crowd you can imagine, knowing that it could get broken up at any moment (TSLA PE 1000+ lol). Or is a more chilled out party with no chance of noise complaints, drama or puke more your thing?\n\nNeither is wrong in my humble opinion, both have their time and place, as well as healthy amounts at every party. I want my party to be fun (ETSY, SQ) but I don't want to risk burning my house down in the process. I want a mix of everyone at my party. I dont want everyone there to be a bunch of wall flowers sitting around not doing anything most of the time (GIS, MO, HSY, etc...). Always good to have some old faithful friends there too who can still have fun (WMT, JNJ, LMT, AAPL, etc...).\n\nLet me know if anyone related to this mentality of running a portfolio.", "score": 77, "created_utc": 1606508484.0, "tickers": [["YOLO", 1]]}

Wide economic moat and duopoly in Canada with extremely high barrier of entry due to capital costs with an extensive network which also penetrates and operates in the United States of America;\n2.

{"submission_name": "t3_k6ia78", "id": "gelbgbx", "text": "When looking at dividend yield, there are two other metrics you should also be looking at: Payout ratio and dividend growth rate. \n\nPayout ratio is showing you what % of the company's earnings they are paying out in dividends. The idea being that a lower % is better because it shows that there is more room to grow the dividend plus there is a margin of safety in the event of an economic downturn.\n\nGrowth rate shows how much the company is growing the dividend over the past 3, 5, 10 years or whatever time span you choose to look at. If we look at T for example, their 5 year growth rate is 2.06% (currently yielding 7.12%). So even though they have a high yield, its barely growing. When factoring in inflation and the lack of stock price growth, your total return can end up being lackluster.\n\nExample: Let's say you bought $10,000 of T and $10,000 of HD in 2011, and didn't reinvest the dividends but collected them this whole time.\n\nHD (19.71% 10 year div growth rate) would pay $8863.09\n\nT (2.21% 10 year div growth rate) would pay $7227.96\n\nHD currently has a dividend yield of 2.24% vs T at 7.12%. However, HD has done extremely well the last 10 years and due to their massive dividend growth rate, had you bought shares in 2011 of each company you would have collected much more from them. \n\nIts not an exact science though, there is no rule that says lower % yield stocks outperform higher % yields. You just need to look into why a stock has a high yield in the first place. If investors want dividends, you'd think they'd go for the highest yield, which in turn would drive the stock price up/ So why is T so high and the stock price not moving much? Debt is one factor, the company is loaded down by a ton of debt. Factors like that can influence stock pricing causing some yields to look better on the surface than they really are.

People don't even like it when companies issue additional shares... much less preferred or bonds unless it is in private placement.\n\nIf a company is offering debt to the public market, that means something. It's normal enough but nevertheless a signal that their debt might be more valuable than their equity.\n\nCorporate bonds can default. You can make money by investing in corporate bonds, but they can default. \n\nLook at some REITs. Realty Income doesn't have any public bonds or preferred to my knowledge, while Gladstone Commercial and Monmouth do (they did issue like a billion dollars in notes this year but that is something banks would buy). Some companies don't have to issue them. Others do. There's a worry that investing in the companies that have to offer them already suggests a company struggling for extra money.\n\nPersonally this space is much better if you enter it via CEFs like HYT. The capital stack only means something in the event a company is at risk of bankruptcy or other declines. You get paid first or second. In a healthy company you should go for its equity, not its debt instruments. If you go for its debt instruments you might as well admit it isn't a safe company to begin with.\n\nPreferred stock CEFs can also be a nice place to park money. PGX is quite stable.

However, in general, younger generations usually gear their portfolios to be more growth oriented and older generations are usually a little more interested in yield.  This is because younger people have very little money and are seeking capital appreciation of their investments to gain lots of money, whereas older people have usually already accrued some money and want to make the money produce stable yet modest returns in the form of dividends.

I put them all there so I can keep an eye on what the overall market is doing in different sectors I’m interested in. It’s like having an S&P ETF without buying them all while I craft my own custom S&P based ETF. The stocks I actually want to get I can compare to other stocks within the sectors and compare how they are doing in comparison to their competition\n\nI don’t buy a stock because it’s moving on momentum or because it’s in the in crowd. I’m picking up stocks that can demonstrate they have mastery over their competitors, they have the ability to diversify their products and services over time, they consistently see positive gains especially in years such as this. If a good quality stock can score a +0.01¢ EPS or better in a pandemic there’s a pretty good chance they will continue to do well outside a pandemic. Debt is important in business and I like to see debt utilized to expand the company whether that’s buying new products, swallowing other companies, or just plain expanding the reach of their own base. If they’re floundering in debt and it’s being underutilized I wouldn’t want to touch it at all. Other things I’m looking at is how their management structure is put together. Are they well oiled or are they having significant management problems that’s contributing to disasters in products and services. What do they do in the case of problems or recalls. How do they handle getting too big. Is there a company that will exist in 100 years. Essentially I’m looking at the stocks as a business to own not a gamble to spend my next $1. \n\nA great example is what happened today. The market tanked and went into the red. But the stocks I actually own gave me a positive balance at the end of the day so I beat the S&P for another day again. I learned some time ago to really beat the S&P you actually don’t want to beat the S&P and you’ll find yourself ahead more days than not during times you want it ahead. I don’t mind some underperforming on positive days because often that will translate to smaller losses or positive gains on negative days\n\nA lot of these stocks I hang on to for years so I’m also looking at is the company I’m owning doing well all these years or is there a competition that’s rising above the pack that might be a better play. By now some of the cyclical stocks are seeing gains of a modest amount but the non cyclical stocks are several hundred % over the original basis. \n\nTo answer your original question. The yield percentage and growth benefits balance naturally happen when you seek stocks you’re going into business with rather than seeking stocks for the highest yield.

We’re the same age and I’m in a similar position, Roth with Vanguard funds (mostly VTSAX), and a few thousand in taxable accounts.\n\nOne way I like to frame it is paying taxes every year vs. paying taxes in lump sums when you eventually sell these growth stocks (assuming total non-dividend for this example).\n\nMy intention is not to sell these dividend stocks when reaching 45 or 50, but to slowly build a machine that will pay you passively. I find it less risky to evaluate a company’s performance now and invest in it to pay me monthly, quarterly, or yearly for the next X years.\n\nFor growth stocks with low or no dividends, it uses the same analysis of “is this a good company to invest in”, but the payoff is delayed. And once the stock is sold, it’s gone. Another nuance is the price of some of these growth stocks and (at least my) current limited ability (low cash) to buy.\n\nThere’s a lot more that goes into both, such as industry innovation or compound interest, but I understand dividend stocks and the snowballing effect of compound interest well enough to be confident in it.\n\nOne other aside, I use M1 (taxable) to purchase growth stocks (can buy bits and pieces), TD Ameritrade for my HSA and taxable (mostly dividends, some trading) and my roth for good old Vanguard mutual funds.

Regular companies can simply elect to halt the dividend altogether and indefinitely. In that case equity growth is nice and preferred. I wouldn't own T because there is little reason that company should be paying out so much since they aren't formally structured to do so.

If you're just starting and don't want to do the work of research, invest into ETFs - SPY, SPHD, SPCD, QQQ, VYM, VOO, VTI, VGT, VXUS, VWO are all some ETFs to look at. \n\nAn ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an organization that takes money and invests into a broad spectrum of stocks and assets. Some of them pay dividends too (SPHD and VYM for example). So by investing into these you're both 1) Diversified, and 2) Having your money actively managed by people who do this professionally (no guarantee they'll be right of course).\n\nAs your portfolio starts to rise and you learn a bit about stock picking you can branch out.

However, 7% a year over 20 years nearly 4x initial investment. And that’s just one lump sum in year 1, not accounting for adding into this portfolio every year.\n\nAnother way to look at it is choosing specific companies like Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch, where if you know it’s a wonderful company or you have specific insight, you can absolutely beat the market given the right research and a fair price. You could have went all-in on McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Walmart, or Apple 20 years ago and outperformed the market. The problem is that we don’t know what happens in 20 years, and these choices weren’t so clear in 2000. Other supposedly great companies in 2000 have also gone to zero.\n\nMy strategy is to max a Roth IRA with mostly VTSAX and other Vanguard funds as a proverbial boat ticket I can use to board Noah’s Ark when I turn 59.5.

There is also reason the think that the S&P is rather inflated currently, although that has always been preached as being the case. S&P growth has outpaced typical dividend yields for a long time now (with risk adjusted returns considered, ie not going all in on a 10% dividend stock), there is still a good chance that going straight into the S&P would be the better option, assuming you believe the historical data will repeat itself (again, no guarantees ever).\n\nRegardless, it’s  an impossible question to answer by virtue of the unknown nature of the future of each individual dividend stock and of the S&P 500 as a whole.

I suppose it could work as some sort of hedge but wouldn’t be more efficient than one or the other. Stocks already compound each year as gains are calculated on a yearly basis so are ever compounding when we speak of returns, they simply aren’t realized, in the same was as using a DRIP with div stocks.

The stock price is where it was right around 2006 and other than the period between 2006 and now the stock has never been that high \n\nLooking at the political situation between covid and sentiment about prisons the US has significantly shifted their perceptions about keeping people locked up. California in particular has shed a good chunk of 50k inmates over the past 10 years with half of it coming due to covid. California also recalled all of their out of state inmates that were in private prisons\n\nThe public itself at this point has shifted to rehabilitation over continued incarceration. While Biden initially signed the bill increasing incarceration he tends to go with the flow of popular opinion so he likely will increase releases. If not through another law then through pardons and commutations. If he can’t shutter a private prison he can reduce how many people go there. He might even have the ability to change the contract language the next time the contracts are up for renewal \n\nAssuming the dividend doesn’t go down you might get lucky to hit $36k assuming the stock goes up to $13 \n\nA few things you are doing though is painting a very rosy picture. When you look at their earnings they’re on a bit of a decline. They actually saw a decline between 2019 and 2020 and this is a 24/7 facility that can’t be impacted by the pandemic \n\nOne thing recently to be mindful of is the feds under the current President is already not renewing contracts: The GEO Group, Inc. (NYSE: GEO) (\"GEO\") announced today that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has decided to not rebid the contract for the company-owned, 1,450-bed Rivers Correctional Facility in North Carolina, which is set to expire on March 31, 2021. The contract for the Rivers Correctional Facility generated approximately $43 million in annualized revenues for GEO. GEO expects to market the Rivers Correctional Facility to other federal and state agencies\n\nThey’re expecting a lower EPS going into the next quarter. As a result of that and other factors their dividends are declining as well. The height of their dividend was back in 2016. Since then it’s been on a marked decline with significant cuts to dividend price\n\nWhile they might be turning a profit today I don’t expect that to be the case always unless they can convert their facilities to move toward inmate rehabilitation instead of inmate incarceration. They say they are the premier rehab facility and if that were true the stock should be booming but it’s not. So until they make changes I would be avoiding this especially with the really high volatility that comes along with it aka one day you might hit $13 a share and the next it could drop down to $8 or lower \n\nYou asked for thoughts :) best advice don’t snag stocks that have ridiculously high dividend %.

It is my firm belief  that your choice of brokerage should empower your investments, not serve as a hinderance.  Even if O remains the only REIT in your portfolio, the company is such a powerful investment that I would jump ship simply to keep it in your portfolio.  Whether you can transfer your account or not is dependent on what the brokerages say.  Some have restrictions.  If you have to sell a few securities for a loss, you can still use it as a tax write-off, so even in death, every investment has value.\n\nStep 2: Check your 401k.  Read the fine print.  More and more 401k plans are allowing the usage of 3rd party brokerages.  If so, check to see which ones are allowed.  Never go with the default option, since most of those still charge commissions.  Get yourself either an M1, Schwab, Fidelity, etc. account with commission free trading and sync it to your 401k plan if you can.  Simply having all your investments with one brokerage is incredibly powerful, and will simplify your tax paperwork.  \n\nStep 3: Whether you even want a 401k is dependent on your timeframe.  Are you a tech programmer making 250k per year planning to invest 200k over ten years and retire at 35 with $2million in the bank?  If so, a retirement account is not for you, since you can't pull from a retirement account until you reach a certain age.  \n\nFor most investors with an average income, I recommend the hybrid approach.  Build both a taxable account and a retirement account together.  Let your dividends compound so that by the time you enter your fifties or early sixties, you would be free to transition away from full time work if necessary (you don't know how your body will age) before the minimum withdrawal age.  You may still need to work part time, but it would allow you greater flexibility to pursue less physically demanding work should that be your current career path.

For me, it didn’t really snowball until I got really serious about paying myself first, and finding opportunities to kick in something extra above my plan on a somewhat regular basis. \n\nEven small extra contributions really start to add up, and at some point the reinvested dividends stop buying you a fraction of a share and start buying multiple shares. \n\nCongrats and good luck moving forward!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1609381885.0, "tickers": []}
