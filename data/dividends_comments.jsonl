Seriously though, I wish M1 had come out 20 years ago, their partial shares / no fee investing is a game changer for investors, that's just my opinion though. \n\nUnfortunately, neither offer a proper DRIP on stocks where you can get the discounts a true drip program has. Both Robinhood and M1 have the dividends paid directly back to the account, it is then on you to choose to reinvest it as you see fit, buying shares in robinhood and/or M1.

(These both pay out monthly)\n\nNow many people say to avoid HIGH YIELD ETFS, but watch out specifically for ones with a decreasing value not covered by dividend. Ie stock pays out 3 dollars a year but it's been losing 3 dollars each year in its own value.\n\nDHY is a bond stock that pays .019 cents but only costs $2.51-3.\n\nMopay stands for monthly paying. With your capital it is SEVERELY hard to find a good portfolio mix that would net you $200 or more.\n\n(Aim for 8 percent mopays to get the cashflow started, afterwards when you need to stabilize this portfolio work on going towards less risky investments and focus more on diversification after getting the cash flow)\n\nSPECIFICALLY REMEMBER THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO GET CASH FLOW.\n\nREITs are great for that, however there can be increased tax responsibility. But the goal of THIS IS CASHFLOW. So understand that starting with an account that may have more tax needs (costs) will likely net you more and at the very least get your portfolio going at which point you can invest later into other things.\n\nSo a couple of good mopays\n\nAPLE, SREIT, SDIV, HYLD (wouldn't recommend, it's a high yield etf - see above), DHY, and ORC (Outlook doesnt look good) \n\nThere is also AMERICAN HOTEL INCOME REIT\n\nMostly 150 ÷ $30000 (150 was gotten by dividing $30,000 by your wanted monthly ($200))  which equals out to wanting a minimum of a .0666% payout each month. (Btw when you X .0666 x 12 (months) you do need a minimum off an 8 percent gain per year. \n\nNow stocks change in value, you will have to monitor and make up for the amount of equity and cash available for your account - ie the goal is to maintain value along with maintaining and growing yourself.\n\nSo if you got $200x12 = $2400\nAnd you lose $400 to stock depreciation then you need to make sure that you're restocking this account and keeping it maintained.\n\n\nI'm 20, I work a shit job and I do this on the side.

{"submission_name": "t3_fhcz8a", "id": "fkarkt3", "text": "MY thoughts with some additional equities:\n\nMMM, ADP, JNJ, PG are very good right now. Incredibly boring but nice long term investments.\n\nMMM is an absolute beast for profitability, yield and capital reinvestment. MorningStar FMV is $186 which represents almost 20% discount from yesterday’s close of $147 and pre market is showing another 3.5% drop. This is the one equity I own very few shares of but will be jumping on it in the next few days like a mob on electronics at Walmart during Black Friday. This is a fantastic deal going forward. I believe one of the best for buy/hold dividend reinvestment.\n\nJNJ and PG are fairly valued right now. They aren’t my top picks but if they drop 10% over the next week, they may be a buy for me.\n\nAFL and ABBV are also good picks. You need to watch AFL long term though due to changes in Japan over the next decade. ABBV is very good fundamentally, undervalued slightly with great ROI and capital reinvestment. The yield is very nice and sustainable.\n\nDIS is undervalued by about $30. This is a great long term stock. With the move into Disney+, they will be printing money BUT it won’t happen for sometime. Disney Parks are a very large revenue generator (as is the cruise line) and you will see drastic shortfalls in the next 2-3 quarters. It’s going to be rough for them the next year. It’s Disney though. That Mouse is probably the most well known rodent in the world and will continue to appeal for years and years to come. DIS is down over 7% in after market trading at $98ish. I believe it hit its 52 week low yesterday of $102. I’d say it’s a buy at this level but it will probably drop a bit more, maybe even into the high 80s in the coming week.\n\nT and VZ are always good. They are at a slight discount right now. You’ll see the dividend for many years. These are not growth stocks at all. In a year or so you will see the equity prices rise but don’t expect more than 2-4% gains per year. Dividend is very safe though.\n\nINTC, PFE and CSCO are discounted pretty nicely right now. You have to watch INTC and CSCO due to their sector. You’ll see nice dividends for years on these but INTC and CSCO probably won’t see bull market gains again for sometime.\n\nD, SO, ED are strong fairly valued regulated equities with 2-4% yearly revenue gains and very nice yields going forward. ED has been paying dividends for years and years. I like it due to their move into Solar electricity generation. They really aren’t discounted now but they are pretty much the most “guaranteed” dividend income generators out there due to their regulated nature. \n\nXOM. I’m on the fence on this one. Oil definitely is a dinosaur industry. It’s so freaking capital intensive and anything below $40 a barrel is starting to kill margins right now. If the barrel price stabilizes around $50 or goes above it, I think XOM is a decent deal for a 5 year hold. You’d have to revisit it after that though. The reason it might be good is due to China. They love oil and coal still and don’t care about using either resource. I hold XOM but it’s definitely more risky, so do your research on this one.\n\nNot great for the next year or maybe 2 years if we do get into a full blown bear market is JPM and WFC. Dividends are safe on these and they are both discounted. These will eek out market increases over the next few years in a bear market but, these are definitely buy and hold for the next decade if you can get them for a decent price. Only issue with JPM is if Dimon dies or leaves the company. That guy is a freaking rockstar and his departure will hit the stock for quite sometime. I just don’t like BAC btw. I won’t own it. The company’s past leaves little desire for me to hold it but that’s just me.\n\nIf you want to have a great yield for the next few years but also want to see your equity drop 20-30%, look into MO. It’s currently undervalued. You’d have to be able to stomach the fundamentals though. For me, I’d love to chase the yield on this but don’t think it’s a great long term value even at its current level. You have to be comfortable with their business and balance sheet if you wanted to invest. China and Europe still love to smoke so...I dunno on this one.\n\nLast but not least is APPL. Yes, it’s a growth/tech stock with a large supply network in China and its overvalued atm, but the fundamentals are there and are freaking fantastic. FMV is about $238-240. If it were to drop to or below that, it would be a buy even in a bear market. Long term, that’s a great company and even though the yield is low, you have small yield increases, large share buybacks and the largest cash hoard in the world.  The share buybacks are MASSIVE for the shareholders.\n\nOut of all of these, I’ll be scrambling for MMM and really looking at DIS and APPL at the right prices.\n\nEdit - Today and tomorrow will be an absolute bloodbath in the markets. Anticipate the DOW hitting 21700 or below by Friday. If it hits those levels, next week might see another 5-10% decline. I wouldn’t move until I see these levels.\n\nAlso, I’m a long term buy and hold investor. Short term drops don’t rattle me much, my stock picks reflect 7-10 year horizons. Do your own research and identify your own risk before making buys. If you’re married, always get buy in from your significant other so you can share the blame (rewards).

Just over a month ago we were celebrating a record Profit-Sharing Day; today we face the greatest economic challenge in our history as the world grapples with the growing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.\n\nI want to thank the more than 13,000 people who have stepped up to take voluntary unpaid leaves – this is the most important thing anyone can do right now to support Delta. While I’m grateful to the thousands that have volunteered, we could use more, so please seriously consider whether this is the right short-term decision for you and your family.\n\nEarlier this week I outlined the serious threat to our business and the difficult actions we’re taking over the next few months to protect our company. Our revenue outlook continues to deteriorate in the short term with the decline in travel demand. We’re now projecting our June quarter revenues will be down by $10 billion compared to a year ago – an 80 percent reduction. It’s also clear, given the underlying damage the virus has created to the overall economy, that demand recovery will take an extended period once the virus is contained.\n\nIn light of the unprecedented challenges facing us, we have entered into a $2.6 billion secured credit facility and are drawing down $3 billion under our existing revolving credit facilities. This will help fortify our cash position in the coming weeks and months. To put this in context, despite all the self-help measures we are taking, we are currently burning roughly $50 million in cash each day.\n\nWe also continue working with the President and Congress on disaster relief assistance, which is vital to protect our industry’s critical role in our nation’s economy. Amid those discussions, in recent days some critics have argued that the airlines have not been good stewards of our money during our profitable years. At Delta, nothing could be further from the truth. Our philosophy has always been a simple one: We put 50 percent of our operating cash flow back into our business by investing in our people and our customers, use 30 percent to pay down debt, and return 20 percent to our owners.\n\nIn fact, over the past five years Delta has invested over $20 billion in new aircraft, airport enhancements, technology and customer service improvements; and invested $19 billion in our people via profit-sharing and pension contributions and payments. In addition, we increased base pay by 30 percent during that period and regained the confidence of the financial markets by earning back our investment-grade credit rating. When the extent of the COVID-19 crisis became clear, we immediately suspended our share repurchases, and our **Board of Directors has voted to suspend future dividend payments.**\n\nWhile these actions will help, the innovation of our people has always been our most powerful tool, and we need it more than ever to protect the future of our company. I have received a remarkable number of ideas and offers to help from Delta people across all divisions as well as our merit employees. We’re reviewing them all and will be making decisions soon on next steps to preserve cash, fortify our future and plan for our eventual recovery. We are exploring all options on help we will need from both merit and frontline people.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1584752851.0, "tickers": []}

Pick solid ones that aren’t overvalued or falling off. I started like 3 months ago and didn’t know much, but now i know so much more,so time is your best friend.

If I have three companies I want to buy shares of in the near future but this investment period I really can only afford one, I'd likely make it a choice between which was cheapest and which had the soonest ex-div date coming.   \n\n\nI would highly doubt there is any stats saying you could be better invested if you bought in at a certain time of the month. Different companies announce earnings at different times, some only really report big news on the Quarter....the economy could tank/recover at any time. Sometimes it dips in the middle of a week and recovers two days late. Some times it rises on a Friday and sinks on the following Monday and vice-versa.   \n\n\nYour questions seem a little silly just because they seem misguided for what kind of investing this is. Unless you have a ton of upfront capital to invest, dividends are a long-term game. It has been statistically proven that the people who make the most money in the stock market are people who just put in a routine, regular amount of money every month, regardless of what is actually happening in the market. So basically, as long as you do your homework on understanding what it is your investing in, and those companies/funds stay solid investment choices...it shouldn't matter when you invest in it as long as you just keep doing it.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1590037363.0, "tickers": []}

In general, dividend growth is too slow for growth investors and income is too low for income investors. ETFs are lukewarm middle grounds for investors who don't want to/have time to do research. And there's nothing wrong with that. If you don't have the time or desire to do the research to get a higher return just use ETFs\n\nAlso dividend etf's tend to underperform the S&P.

Obviously you would purchase more in time, but the hope is that you will own enough shares for the DRIP to buy you more shares in time.\n\nSo, as an example, for the KO dividend to buy one share for \"free\", you would need to own around 112 shares (if the price is $46). Obviously this takes a lot of time and finances, but is well worth it if you are a buy and hold investor. This is why stocks like T, OKE, etc. are popular is that it doesn't take too many shares to make the drips earn more shares on themselves. T, for example, only needs about 60 shares for you to \"receive\" a free share off of the DRIP off of dividends earned. This is the strategy I'm hoping to do with KO, T, ET, etc. that it'll just keep buying shares and I won't have to spend any more money investing in the company, and can focus my investments on different companies.\n\ntl;dr: Compound DRIPs will help you earn more dividends in time even on fractional shares.

{"submission_name": "t3_gvfb8y", "id": "fsoglo6", "text": "This is my psychology and mindset:\n\nI mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses.\n\nSince I intend on holding forever, I must choose well established HIGH-QUALITY BLUE-CHIP DIVIDEND PAYING companies with wide economic moats because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (if not more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity.\n\nPeople often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid.

{"submission_name": "t3_gvfb8y", "id": "fsq1je0", "text": "Unless you have a lot of capital up front, large dividends are a long-term destination. What will keep you going every month is adding bit by bit to your future empire. The amount of work that you're doing now to try and cut corners can help you in some ways, but it's going to hurt you in others.   \n\n\nIt sounds like you're going through manic stages thinking about how rich you could be if you bet on just the right horse. I've been there, it's maddening. The truth is that you could....but you almost definitely won't. An investor who invests with their emotions is a bad investor, because the same feeling you get when you buy these high risk stocks will turn into a feeling of panic whenever they do poorly.   \n\n\nI make less than 30k in a year and in 9 months have saved roughly half my income for investing. My initial investment was about $500 from my savings account, plus $400 from my next paycheck. Every month after that I have put in around $500-600 from my paychecks, plus my tax return $600, plus the majority of the stimulus check since I have a job. I started with $700 and with regular, boring ass monthly contributions, plus re-investing all earned dividends, I have amassed a portfolio currently worth $7,946, which is only a little over $500 below where it was pre-pandemic. Barring any more dividend cuts, this nets me over $400 in dividends this year, which will likely hit $500 before the year's end, and this is with a pretty damn safe portfolio.  \n\n\nIs that $500 in dividends this year going to take me to financial bliss? No. But that $500 this year will be like getting an entire extra month's worth of money to invest in, for free. Next year, I will start the year with that extra $500 coming down the line, plus whatever I add to it for the next year, hopefully another $500. Then I'm starting my third year with $1000 in dividends. It's a barrel rolling down the hill, picking up speed. I have about 40 years to invest before I hit senior citizen status. In a worst case scenario, if my life situation never improves money wise and I only ever achieve $500 in new dividends each year on top of my pre-existing dividends...I still make at retirement my take home pay right now.   \n\n\nStatistics have shown that the investors who make the most money are not those who try to time the market, looking for those sweet cheat codes to financial freedom. Instead, the investors who make the most money are the ones who just contribute a regular amount to normal/boring investments every month and never stop.   \n\n\nThere is something to be said for exciting stocks versus boring ones, and that is to say that you should be excited in what you are buying into, but for the right reasons. To me, I see a boring company like LEG or IP and I get excited because I know that they are still going to be in business a decade from now, doing what they're doing, paying me dividends. I also want to buy into companies whose products I like and use, like KO for Coke, UN for Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, T for HBO and Warner Media. But there are also stocks and funds I want to buy into because I legitimately am excited for the work that they do and the potential they have for the future. Those are all things to consider when you are buying a stock. But I think to be the most successful you have to look at the company/fund in these ways, because if you go off of something as volatile as dividend yield it could leave you invested in a company on it's way to disaster.   \n\n\nBy all means, invest in the risky shit, but understand that while all of investing is gambling, that's gambling with your future in a very real way. Keep those stocks to a small amount of your portfolio...use the dividends to buy into safer companies. If they do well you profit regardless, but if they don't do well, it's only a small part of the portfolio. You gotta understand your risk tolerance and learn to stay within those bounds. Keep your regular investments the same but maybe set aside a little money every month just for a risky purchase. At the end of the day, no one can tell you exactly how YOU should be investing, so your best bet is to set goals for yourself that you can readily achieve and then try to hit those goals on a timed basis...weeks, months..whatever. Some sort of metric that shows you are accomplishing goals, that you are making headway, even if it looks like it will take forever...you will have proof that you are making progress. And when you see the numbers increasing and increasing, maybe it will help ease your mind about if you could just cut those corners and invest in all high-yield gambles.", "score": 10, "created_utc": 1591167797.0, "tickers": [["LEG", 1], ["IP", 1], ["KO", 1], ["T", 1]]}

It is reported each quarter on the Statement of Cash Flows, one of the 3 required financial reports (Income statement and Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet) are the other two) If you subtract from CFFO any preferred dividends and/or distributions to non-controlling interests, what you then have is Net CFFO. This is what common dividends are paid from and is the single best measure of available cash.\n\nFor Realty Income, using rolling 4Q (a full 12 months) data, the Net CFFO for for the 4Q ending 1Q20 was ($MM) $1,120 while common dividends paid were $881, for a dividend payout ratio of 78.7%\n\nBruceM", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1592067224.0, "tickers": []}

T is the exception, not the rule.  Yield chasing is not how you want to live your life. Nobody makes money yield chasing. Every yield chaser loses money. \n\nBut anyways, lets take a look:\n\n>Energy Transfer\n\n2/10. Sell. Revenue and Profit are soaring, but the dividend is remaining stagnant.  However, the payout ratio is also simultaneously somehow way too high. The company is taking on debt to fund a dividend, when the company isnt even 20 years old. It is always concerning when a young company is taking on debt to pay a dividend. \n\nThis company clearly is either staffed with incompetent management, greedy management who prioritize their own paychecks over the long term health of the company, or some combination of the two. \n\nGood replacement: Dominion Energy. \n\n>Chimera\n\n0/10. Sell. Similar to ET. Debt to fund the dividend is never healthy. Except this company is actually reducing its dividend while still taking on debt to fund the reduced dividend.  This is how companies enter death spirals.\n\n In 2010 it paid out $.76 a share. Yet now you are getting $0.30 a share in 2020. Sell out and write this loss off.\n\nGood replacement: Home Depot (add some diversity to your portfolio)\n\n>Altria\n\n3/10. Sell. Cigarettes are a dirty business.  They are all effectively squeezing blood from a stone right now. The smoking population has been going nothing but down for decades. The addictive properties of cigarettes make for a good recurring customer base, but unfortunately cigarettes have a tendency to kill their best customers. Rapid price increases are leading to record profits now, but they are pricing out potential new customers. Smoking rates for young people are at historic lows, and just keep getting lower. Eventually, this company will start to slide, then it will be nothing but down.   Due to the taxes on cigarettes, decreasing the price is virtually impossible.\n\nI would stay away from the industry as a whole, because once the slide starts, it will never stop. \n\nGood replacement: Kimberly Clark. The women in your life need tampons, and the babies of the world need diapers. Kimberly Clark is a market leader in both.\n\n>ATT\n\nI'm actually pretty bullish on AT&T. Management hadnt been held accountable for quite some time, but now someone is holding their feet to the fire, and the company looks poised to clean itself up. Even if it doesn't, the dividend is well covered by earnings and the company has an IP library rivalled only by Disney.\n\nCompanion pick: Verizon.  I like T and Verizon to be equal weight in my portfolio.\n\n>Enterprise\n\nI would hold for right now and see which way the wind blows. Lots of debt to fund prior dividends. Company looks like it is trying to turn itself around. \n\nReplacement if the company regresses: Microsoft. Well diversified tech company.\n\n>Universal\n\nDon't really have strong opinions on this one to make a definitive judgement. I haven't looked at the numbers enough. I would compare and contrast it with Disney, then pick whichever has the better balance sheet. \n\n>SImon properties\n\nJust announced a dividend cut. No thank you. Plenty of REITs out there with a balance sheet able to weather the storm.\n\nGood replacement: O. The company speaks for itself. \n\n>Exxon,\n\nOil is a dying breed propped up by the US government.

{"submission_name": "t3_hiojd2", "id": "fwi1lee", "text": "To analyze safe dividends, pay attention to the following ten points:\n\n1. Dividend Coverage: Does the company have enough money to pay the dividend?\n2. Dividend Growth: A company growing its dividends consistently is a great indicator of financial and operational health.\n3. Earnings/Free Cash Flow Growth: A company’s cash floe must coincide with dividend growth. If cash flow does not grow with the dividend, the company cannot afford to grow its dividend indefinitely.\n4. Interest Coverage: Can the company pay its debt? Interest Coverage compares the company’s  earnings to the interest expense on debt. It is ideal for earnings to be at least twice that of its interest expense. A score of 26 is excellent and indicates earnings far exceed debt.\n5. Debt To Equity Ratio: A higher score is a better score. The higher a specific securities’ percentile, the better.\n6. Credit Rating: The better the rating, the better a company’s credit worthiness as a borrower. This indicates a good ability to pay back debts, which is itself a good indicator of good financial position.\n7. Prior Recession Performance: Did the company collapse? Did the stock take a hit? Did it rebound? A longer history is often a good indicator of health. Companies like Visa only went public in 2008, so there is not much information on Visa in this regard.\n8. Cyclicality: General Mills has smooth and steady earnings. People want to constantly eat their food products. On the other hand, clothing stores\n9.

I think CVS’s attempts to vertically integrate their business are going to prove successful in the long-run. CVS has been on the decline for the past few years for the same reason as WBA: Declining gross margin on pharmaceutical products (which btw make up a pretty significant portion of each company’s revenue). I believe that by getting into the insurance game CVS will be able to diversify their revenue stream. \n\nAnother risk to CVS/WBA in general is also going to be Amazon. Amazon is looking to get into the pharmaceutical industry as well and they have tendency of wiping the floor with their competitors through aggressive underpricing. Also, Amazon is expanding their distribution and delivery network considerably and many Americans would appreciate the convenience of being able to have their medications delivered to their doorstep without having to walk into a pharmacy. \n\nThird, do you still plan on holding onto Dominion (D) even though they just sold off assets at fire sale prices to Buffett, lowered dividend and guidance, and planned to use the revenue from the sale on stock repurchases?

{"submission_name": "t3_j2u8xu", "id": "g77xif6", "text": "Here are some more general guidelines which I sincerely believe that everyone should have ingrained in their heads when formulating their personal strategy:\n\n1. Pay no respect to volatility of the markets. Who fucking cares about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever the fuck we are on the \"graph\". You should not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, you should not care at all. Volatility should not mean anything to you since you should be a super long-term investor.\n2. You cannot predict the future and you cannot time the market. \"Time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies. Therefore, you should invest as much as you can every time you get paid while while balancing a decent quality of life (whatever that means to you). Basically, don't try to pull off some \"smart shit\" by pulling out your money because you think the markets will crash and then put your money back into the market after it crashes to capitalize on that hypothetical situation in your little head. Turn off your brain and keep your money in the markets because again, \"time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies.\n3. You should consider investing in an \"index exchange traded fund\" or \"index-ETF\" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index-ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors who pick stocks will under perform an index-ETF over the long-term.\n4. Don’t day trade. Don't try to \"get rich quick\". Don't try to \"buy low, sell high\". Don't buy shit/garbage. Don't buy \"meme stocks\". Don't worry about \"missing out\". Build wealth slowly over time as this is a long-term game and not a short-term or medium-term game.\n5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity because everything goes on sale which includes high-quality companies and index-ETFs; and therefore, you get to buy more stuff at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them instead because these are the times which can actually accelerate you towards your financial goals quicker.\n6. Again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics/elections, wars, recessions, poverty, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in buying index-ETFs or purchasing well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until you retire or die.\n7. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks about volatility).\n\nKeep it simple. Keep yourself disciplined. Keep hustling. Keep your money. Good luck with personal finance and investing! =)", "score": 58, "created_utc": 1601500156.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_jz1ds0", "id": "gd9bfoa", "text": "I was on the same boat as you, but then I realized I could have a more stable and larger income with the same investment using options. \n\nMy strategy is \"The Wheel\" or \"Triple Income investing\" (which I've modified to be Pentuple income investing). \n\nI'll break down as simple as possible for those new to the concept. \n\nI pick a stock that has a dividend pay out that I wouldn't mind holding. Then I sell a \"Cash Covered Put\" what this is, is essentially me going to someone with 100 shares of the stock and saying \"Hey your stock is gonna go up\" and they say \"I'm not so sure\". So I sell them insurance. They pay a \"Premium\" and if the stock falls below the \"Strike Price\" we agree on, I HAVE to buy the shares at the strike price, regardless of how low it goes. Now if it doesn't go below the strike price, I keep the premium, they keep the shares.\n\nThe goal in this first step is to NOT get assigned the shares, so you tend to be conservative with the put. However, with $5k cash on hand, you can expect around $100 in premium per week playing relatively safe puts. You're never going to get a dividend return like that. \n\nNow, IF I lose (and it does happen) I will be assigned the shares. Oh well. I overpaid for some stock, hopefully not by a lot. (Remember I have to buy regardless of how low it goes). Now that I have the stock, I can eat the loss and start again, or I can do the second step of the wheel. \n\nStep 2: I use those shares to sell a \"Covered Call\". This is where I go to someone who wants to BUY 100 shares of the stock I hold, and they think it's gonna go up by a lot. I say \"Ya right\" and then sell them the opportunity to buy the shares at a lower strike price than they think it will get to. They pay me a premium for this opportunity. \n\nOnce again, if the shares reach above the strike price, I am obligated to sell them at the strike price, regardless of how high it goes. If the shares do not reach the strike when the contract expires, I keep them and the premium. \n\nThe goal again can be to sell or not sell depending on how much I like the stock. \n\nOnce I'm wrong on this part of the wheel, I sell the shares at the strike price, which is ideally more than I paid in the first step. Meaning I got premium from Step 1 and Step 2 and then income from the sale in the call. AKA - Triple income. \n\nHow I modify it is pretty simple. I pick stocks that pay dividends. When the Ex date is coming up, I make the goal to get assigned or keep the shares, so I can collect the dividend payment as well as premium. (That's income source 4). \n\nThen I take all premium and gains and use them to invest into \"Safe Bet\" dividend payers - (Income source 5). \n\n\nIt is much riskier than playing the dividend game, but if you're young and have time to bounce back from a loss - and of course you don't use ALL your money to play this strategy, you should theoretically come out ahead more times than you lose. You'll be able to collect a pretty decent amount weekly, and over time build positions much, much faster. \n\nThe downside - If an event like march happens, you're going to lose BIG, but at the end of the day, for better or worse, you'll still get assigned some shares of stock. So long as the company does not go out of business, you'll live to fight another day - and let's be real if you were holding dividend stocks during an event like covid crash you were gonna lose big anyway.", "score": 76, "created_utc": 1606077301.0, "tickers": []}

People don't even like it when companies issue additional shares... much less preferred or bonds unless it is in private placement.\n\nIf a company is offering debt to the public market, that means something. It's normal enough but nevertheless a signal that their debt might be more valuable than their equity.\n\nCorporate bonds can default. You can make money by investing in corporate bonds, but they can default. \n\nLook at some REITs. Realty Income doesn't have any public bonds or preferred to my knowledge, while Gladstone Commercial and Monmouth do (they did issue like a billion dollars in notes this year but that is something banks would buy). Some companies don't have to issue them. Others do. There's a worry that investing in the companies that have to offer them already suggests a company struggling for extra money.\n\nPersonally this space is much better if you enter it via CEFs like HYT. The capital stack only means something in the event a company is at risk of bankruptcy or other declines. You get paid first or second. In a healthy company you should go for its equity, not its debt instruments. If you go for its debt instruments you might as well admit it isn't a safe company to begin with.\n\nPreferred stock CEFs can also be a nice place to park money. PGX is quite stable.

California in particular has shed a good chunk of 50k inmates over the past 10 years with half of it coming due to covid. California also recalled all of their out of state inmates that were in private prisons\n\nThe public itself at this point has shifted to rehabilitation over continued incarceration. While Biden initially signed the bill increasing incarceration he tends to go with the flow of popular opinion so he likely will increase releases. If not through another law then through pardons and commutations. If he can’t shutter a private prison he can reduce how many people go there.

As a result of that and other factors their dividends are declining as well. The height of their dividend was back in 2016. Since then it’s been on a marked decline with significant cuts to dividend price\n\nWhile they might be turning a profit today I don’t expect that to be the case always unless they can convert their facilities to move toward inmate rehabilitation instead of inmate incarceration. They say they are the premier rehab facility and if that were true the stock should be booming but it’s not. So until they make changes I would be avoiding this especially with the really high volatility that comes along with it aka one day you might hit $13 a share and the next it could drop down to $8 or lower \n\nYou asked for thoughts :) best advice don’t snag stocks that have ridiculously high dividend %.

It is my firm belief  that your choice of brokerage should empower your investments, not serve as a hinderance.  Even if O remains the only REIT in your portfolio, the company is such a powerful investment that I would jump ship simply to keep it in your portfolio.  Whether you can transfer your account or not is dependent on what the brokerages say.  Some have restrictions.  If you have to sell a few securities for a loss, you can still use it as a tax write-off, so even in death, every investment has value.\n\nStep 2: Check your 401k.  Read the fine print.  More and more 401k plans are allowing the usage of 3rd party brokerages.  If so, check to see which ones are allowed.  Never go with the default option, since most of those still charge commissions.  Get yourself either an M1, Schwab, Fidelity, etc. account with commission free trading and sync it to your 401k plan if you can.  Simply having all your investments with one brokerage is incredibly powerful, and will simplify your tax paperwork.  \n\nStep 3: Whether you even want a 401k is dependent on your timeframe.  Are you a tech programmer making 250k per year planning to invest 200k over ten years and retire at 35 with $2million in the bank?  If so, a retirement account is not for you, since you can't pull from a retirement account until you reach a certain age.  \n\nFor most investors with an average income, I recommend the hybrid approach.  Build both a taxable account and a retirement account together.  Let your dividends compound so that by the time you enter your fifties or early sixties, you would be free to transition away from full time work if necessary (you don't know how your body will age) before the minimum withdrawal age.  You may still need to work part time, but it would allow you greater flexibility to pursue less physically demanding work should that be your current career path.  It also allows you to call it quits early if you end up having incredible luck in the market and wish to cash out of the workforce.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1608779733.0, "tickers": [["O", 1]]}
