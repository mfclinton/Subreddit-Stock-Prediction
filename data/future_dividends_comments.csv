t3_an1u87,efr6jka,"Very cool, I like seeing people use new tools in their portfolios.

I would offer two bits of advice for enhancing a great tool you already have.

1. Create a metric for increasing value. A lot of the stocks on your list are REITs or BDCs and it often happens their share value never grows, they pay out huge dividends and then end up cutting the dividend because they can’t afford it. Then you’ve invested into a company that no longer is delivering the only reason you picked it.

Find companies that have good dividend yields and have a track record of building share value, the dividends will come and you will have a portfolio that will be much safer and will grow over time.

2. This one would be just for fun, pull alpha and beta for all of these stocks to compare your risk ve the market and your ror over the market. Incorporate those into your solver to find a solution that maximizes your return while minimizing risk

t3_anezm0,efukq3q,"I use Robinhood and hold about 20% of my porfolio here because of their free options trading, covered calls is pretty common in the dividend investing world,  and M1 does not offer this. You don't want to do that with all of your holdings though, just the stable ones, and that's partially the reason for being the smaller side of my portfolio. The one downside to Robinhood is that their platform does not have hardly any of the bells and whistles of most of the other more mature platforms, like a DRIP setup. That said, I do root for them and hope to see them grow, they are a minnow in a shark pond with their free trades for all model, my old broker TD Ameritrade wouldn't go to free, so I moved on. 

 M1 has the other 80% of my portfolio, I use it for Roth IRA's (something Robinhood does not offer), and a taxable account. Like others have said, M1 has partial shares investing at no cost, with pies that can have pies, so you can basically build your own etf's with this kind of setup. it's beautiful. I would like to add that M1 is already a nice platform, and is maturing quickly, coming out with new improvements constantly. {rant} If the guys over at r/M1Finance read this, the only thing I would improve would be to add a checkbox to place holdings on a hold only (no buy status) or to let us be able to transfer into new pies without having to sell and then buy back the whole holding, just dropping to 1% does not mean it will not buy again if you are heavily diversified {/rant}. Seriously though, I wish M1 had come out 20 years ago, their partial shares / no fee investing is a game changer for investors, that's just my opinion though. 

Unfortunately, neither offer a proper DRIP on stocks where you can get the discounts a true drip program has. Both Robinhood and M1 have the dividends paid directly back to the account, it is then on you to choose to reinvest it as you see fit, buying shares in robinhood and/or M1. M1 has the benefit of being able to just use their auto-invest setting, which is available because of the partial shares investing approach they have.

But Here in America I mostly focus on REITS that pay monthly dividends and have at least a 5 year growth in value and have stable earnings and dividend growth, the reason I love monthly dividend paying stock REITS is because by law here in the US. They have to distribute a high percentage of their earnings to shareholders and this makes for a great extra income and savings plus REITS are pretty much real estate companies that see stable income, the bad thing is that because they pay high amounts to shareholders they have very little to reinvest in growth but still it’s stable and i like that, and yes I use robinhood sorry I doubt this is much help to you in the UK, but hopefully you guys gave Somthing similar to REITS or maybe your market is open to the American REIT stocks?",2,1571156857,[],,,

t3_e1j7kd,f8qj1lz,"So I am in a similar stage as you my good sir and each month my aim is for an 8% gain on mopay stocks be it mostly US, Canadian, and International.

Global X makes some wonderful ETFs that would be a good start for you.

Specifically their Super Dividend ETF and their super dividend REIT ETF. (These both pay out monthly)

Now many people say to avoid HIGH YIELD ETFS, but watch out specifically for ones with a decreasing value not covered by dividend. Ie stock pays out 3 dollars a year but it's been losing 3 dollars each year in its own value.

DHY is a bond stock that pays .019 cents but only costs $2.51-3.

Mopay stands for monthly paying. With your capital it is SEVERELY hard to find a good portfolio mix that would net you $200 or more.

(Aim for 8 percent mopays to get the cashflow started, afterwards when you need to stabilize this portfolio work on going towards less risky investments and focus more on diversification after getting the cash flow)

SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO GET CASH FLOW.

REITs are great for that, however there can be increased tax responsibility. But the goal of THIS IS CASHFLOW. So understand that starting with an account that may have more tax needs (costs) will likely net you more and at the very least get your portfolio going at which point you can invest later into other things.

So a couple of good mopays

APLE, SREIT, SDIV, HYLD (wouldn't recommend, it's a high yield etf - see above), DHY, and ORC (Outlook doesnt look good) 

There is also AMERICAN HOTEL INCOME REIT

Mostly 150 ÷ $30000 (150 was gotten by dividing $30,000 by your wanted monthly ($200))  which equals out to wanting a minimum of a .0666% payout each month. (Btw when you X .0666 x 12 (months) you do need a minimum off an 8 percent gain per year. 

Now stocks change in value, you will have to monitor and make up for the amount of equity and cash available for your account - ie the goal is to maintain value along with maintaining and growing yourself.

So if you got $200x12 = $2400
And you lose $400 to stock depreciation then you need to make sure that you're restocking this account and keeping it maintained.


I'm 20, I work a shit job and I do this on the side. My account has a value of less then $2200. So take this advice in stride.

97.348% + 15.233% = 112.591%  Year=2013

Now for Coke:

112.772% + 1.648% = 114.443% Year=2019

> The Fund is a diversified closed-end fund. The primary investment objective is to seek high current income; capital appreciation is a secondary objective. The Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 65% of its total assets in income-generating equity securities, including dividend-paying common stocks, convertible securities, preferred stocks, and other equity-related securities, which may include up to 25% in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate industry operating companies. Up to 35% of the Fund's total assets may be invested in nonconvertible debt securities consisting primarily of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds. In addition, the Fund utilizes leveraging techniques in an attempt to obtain a higher return for the Fund. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. 

Personally, I wouldn’t recommend this fund. If you’re young then an income based fund shouldn’t be you’re primary goal. It also utilizes leveraging... this alone can backfire longterm. However, it all depends on your goals. I prefer a “set & forget” type of REIT like O or NNN.

t3_fhcz8a,fkarkt3,"MY thoughts with some additional equities:

MMM, ADP, JNJ, PG are very good right now. Incredibly boring but nice long term investments.

MMM is an absolute beast for profitability, yield and capital reinvestment. MorningStar FMV is $186 which represents almost 20% discount from yesterday’s close of $147 and pre market is showing another 3.5% drop. This is the one equity I own very few shares of but will be jumping on it in the next few days like a mob on electronics at Walmart during Black Friday. This is a fantastic deal going forward. I believe one of the best for buy/hold dividend reinvestment.

JNJ and PG are fairly valued right now. They aren’t my top picks but if they drop 10% over the next week, they may be a buy for me.

AFL and ABBV are also good picks. You need to watch AFL long term though due to changes in Japan over the next decade. ABBV is very good fundamentally, undervalued slightly with great ROI and capital reinvestment. The yield is very nice and sustainable.

DIS is undervalued by about $30. This is a great long term stock. With the move into Disney+, they will be printing money BUT it won’t happen for sometime. Disney Parks are a very large revenue generator (as is the cruise line) and you will see drastic shortfalls in the next 2-3 quarters. It’s going to be rough for them the next year. It’s Disney though. That Mouse is probably the most well known rodent in the world and will continue to appeal for years and years to come. DIS is down over 7% in after market trading at $98ish. I believe it hit its 52 week low yesterday of $102. I’d say it’s a buy at this level but it will probably drop a bit more, maybe even into the high 80s in the coming week.

T and VZ are always good. They are at a slight discount right now. You’ll see the dividend for many years. These are not growth stocks at all. In a year or so you will see the equity prices rise but don’t expect more than 2-4% gains per year. Dividend is very safe though.

INTC, PFE and CSCO are discounted pretty nicely right now. You have to watch INTC and CSCO due to their sector. You’ll see nice dividends for years on these but INTC and CSCO probably won’t see bull market gains again for sometime.

D, SO, ED are strong fairly valued regulated equities with 2-4% yearly revenue gains and very nice yields going forward. ED has been paying dividends for years and years. I like it due to their move into Solar electricity generation. They really aren’t discounted now but they are pretty much the most “guaranteed” dividend income generators out there due to their regulated nature. 

XOM. I’m on the fence on this one. Oil definitely is a dinosaur industry. It’s so freaking capital intensive and anything below $40 a barrel is starting to kill margins right now. If the barrel price stabilizes around $50 or goes above it, I think XOM is a decent deal for a 5 year hold. You’d have to revisit it after that though. The reason it might be good is due to China. They love oil and coal still and don’t care about using either resource. I hold XOM but it’s definitely more risky, so do your research on this one.

Not great for the next year or maybe 2 years if we do get into a full blown bear market is JPM and WFC. Dividends are safe on these and they are both discounted. These will eek out market increases over the next few years in a bear market but, these are definitely buy and hold for the next decade if you can get them for a decent price. Only issue with JPM is if Dimon dies or leaves the company. That guy is a freaking rockstar and his departure will hit the stock for quite sometime. I just don’t like BAC btw. I won’t own it. The company’s past leaves little desire for me to hold it but that’s just me.

If you want to have a great yield for the next few years but also want to see your equity drop 20-30%, look into MO. It’s currently undervalued. You’d have to be able to stomach the fundamentals though. For me, I’d love to chase the yield on this but don’t think it’s a great long term value even at its current level. You have to be comfortable with their business and balance sheet if you wanted to invest. China and Europe still love to smoke so...I dunno on this one.

Last but not least is APPL. Yes, it’s a growth/tech stock with a large supply network in China and its overvalued atm, but the fundamentals are there and are freaking fantastic. FMV is about $238-240. If it were to drop to or below that, it would be a buy even in a bear market. Long term, that’s a great company and even though the yield is low, you have small yield increases, large share buybacks and the largest cash hoard in the world.  The share buybacks are MASSIVE for the shareholders.

Out of all of these, I’ll be scrambling for MMM and really looking at DIS and APPL at the right prices.

Edit - Today and tomorrow will be an absolute bloodbath in the markets. Anticipate the DOW hitting 21700 or below by Friday. If it hits those levels, next week might see another 5-10% decline. I wouldn’t move until I see these levels.

Also, I’m a long term buy and hold investor. Short term drops don’t rattle me much, my stock picks reflect 7-10 year horizons. Do your own research and identify your own risk before making buys. If you’re married, always get buy in from your significant other so you can share the blame (rewards).

Here is the link to the MEMOS to EMPLOYEES

It has been an extraordinary few weeks, to say the least, for our business, our nation and our world. Just over a month ago we were celebrating a record Profit-Sharing Day; today we face the greatest economic challenge in our history as the world grapples with the growing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

I want to thank the more than 13,000 people who have stepped up to take voluntary unpaid leaves – this is the most important thing anyone can do right now to support Delta. While I’m grateful to the thousands that have volunteered, we could use more, so please seriously consider whether this is the right short-term decision for you and your family.

Earlier this week I outlined the serious threat to our business and the difficult actions we’re taking over the next few months to protect our company. Our revenue outlook continues to deteriorate in the short term with the decline in travel demand. We’re now projecting our June quarter revenues will be down by $10 billion compared to a year ago – an 80 percent reduction. It’s also clear, given the underlying damage the virus has created to the overall economy, that demand recovery will take an extended period once the virus is contained.

In light of the unprecedented challenges facing us, we have entered into a $2.6 billion secured credit facility and are drawing down $3 billion under our existing revolving credit facilities. This will help fortify our cash position in the coming weeks and months. To put this in context, despite all the self-help measures we are taking, we are currently burning roughly $50 million in cash each day.

We also continue working with the President and Congress on disaster relief assistance, which is vital to protect our industry’s critical role in our nation’s economy. Amid those discussions, in recent days some critics have argued that the airlines have not been good stewards of our money during our profitable years. At Delta, nothing could be further from the truth. Our philosophy has always been a simple one: We put 50 percent of our operating cash flow back into our business by investing in our people and our customers, use 30 percent to pay down debt, and return 20 percent to our owners.

In fact, over the past five years Delta has invested over $20 billion in new aircraft, airport enhancements, technology and customer service improvements; and invested $19 billion in our people via profit-sharing and pension contributions and payments. In addition, we increased base pay by 30 percent during that period and regained the confidence of the financial markets by earning back our investment-grade credit rating. When the extent of the COVID-19 crisis became clear, we immediately suspended our share repurchases, and our **Board of Directors has voted to suspend future dividend payments.**

While these actions will help, the innovation of our people has always been our most powerful tool, and we need it more than ever to protect the future of our company. I have received a remarkable number of ideas and offers to help from Delta people across all divisions as well as our merit employees. We’re reviewing them all and will be making decisions soon on next steps to preserve cash, fortify our future and plan for our eventual recovery. We are exploring all options on help we will need from both merit and frontline people.",3,1584752851,[],,,

If you are really interested mREIT maybe it is preferable to buy a basket ETF like REM.

Or find out which in REM are the ""strongest"", are not cutting 100% their dividend.

If you are thinking of creating an ""income factory"" then at least make sure that Total Return performance (gain + dividend) is as good as SPY average 10% performance (2% dividend + 8% gain) more or less. SPY is expected to no return this much for the next decades, but even if discounted at 7%-8% total return per year it is not bad.

Otherwise, why bother? 

Let's say today you are retired and you have $1,000,000 in SPY with an average total return of 8% in the future years. And you do not re-invest the dividends.

So your $1,000,000 has become $1,060,000.

It should generates 2% dividend ($20,000) and $60,000 gain, but if you need $50,000 a year to live, you could sell $30,000 of SPY.

You are left with $1,030,000, that will generate $20,600 dividend, and $61,800 gain. etc...

This simple scenario, where the market goes up, it does not include income tax nor capital gain tax, it does not include effect of inflation on your income needs.

Capital gain tax is usually less than income tax. There are different tax rate for different thresholds for income tax and capital gain tax, in different countries.

You need to work them out to see what is most advantageous to you.

Dividend investing is great but not at the detriment of total return.

And as the current market crash has shown, one needs to add safety to his/her portfolio with bonds (60% stocks/40% bonds which is heavily debated), TLT for example (about 2% dividend). Compare SPY to TLT for the past 6 months.",2,1587729537,[],,,

Personally when starting out, I went with one stock until I had a comfortable amount. Example I plan to invest 10k over the next year. I want 10 stocks with 1k in each stock. So I put my first 1k into 1 stock.
It doesn't necessarily mean it will grow faster or slower then if I had 10 stocks or 1 stock. It's about the businesses.

Quality company over yield. Always. When I see a fat dividend I used to get excited. ""Oh wow I could get 1k a year with my 10k investment."" Then a year passes and I got the 1k in dividends, but lost 2k in the stock price. Example: PSEC. Even before covid hit...



 I do my own analysis on each stock and what I would be comfortable with paying for that business. I'm talking about reviewing their 10k reports. Listen to earnings calls. Understand the business and it's challenges, competitors. Then I check the market cap. I choose the best priced business out of the 10 and buy it.

If your goal is to create cash flow from your investments, you can actually benefit from stagnant or decreasing share price, assuming the company is a massive industry powerhouse that is not going to go broke any time soon ( think MO and utilities etc). Dividend income is based on number of shares owned. If you reinvest your dividends in a flat or decreasing stock, your dividend dollars buy an increasing amount of shares (assuming the dividend remains constant).  If the company still increases its dividend yearly, this makes the increase in shares even more dramatic. So while you’re total portfolio value decreases, your current income compounds.

See, any of us can buy KO right now, but we'll never get the kind of yield Warren gets, and it's simple math as to why.  Dividend yield is the annual payout amount divided by the stock price that you paid for that share.

Warren's average cost per share of KO?  Dunno, but I sure as shit bet it's well below the 40'ish dollars a share costs right now.  Let's say he paid half that amount, $20/share.  KO common stock is paying $1.64 annual, divide that by $20 and you get a yield of 8.2%.  With that kind of yield, you don't need that much growth each year in order to keep up with the average S&P 500 returns.

Problem is, investing in a stock that yields 8% or higher is super risky.  You have to find a company that is paying about half that yield right now and invest a boatload of money into it so DRIP can work its magic, then hope that the company continues to remain solvent for decades and increase its dividend payout at least enough to sustain it and grow it a bit to account for inflation...all while at least doubling the price of the stock compared to your cost basis.

Now their attractiveness can certainly be called in question but these are companies with a long dividend paying history, with very strong financials. Other very strong companies with strong dividends include Microsoft and Apple. I wouldn’t ever invest in Ford.

If you’re looking to diversify I’d say to look at some of the companies I mentioned that can present a strong source of passive income, albeit with a lot less growth potential than some other companies. It all depends on what you want from your dividend portfolio and what your age+long term strategy is. I haven’t looked into the companies you mentioned, but I would look to diversify to some of the sorts of companies that you can trust a little more, with more history.

If you want to invest in shorter increments than once every four weeks I doubt it makes much of a difference in the long run, but it can't hurt. I invest on my pay periods, so every two weeks.   


You should be trying to take advantage of as many fractional shares as possible, but as I found out today sometimes you just can't. For those times, it would just be a matter of looking at what my goals are and planning around it for the investment. Why would it be important to buy one sooner than the others? If I have three companies I want to buy shares of in the near future but this investment period I really can only afford one, I'd likely make it a choice between which was cheapest and which had the soonest ex-div date coming.   


I would highly doubt there is any stats saying you could be better invested if you bought in at a certain time of the month. Different companies announce earnings at different times, some only really report big news on the Quarter....the economy could tank/recover at any time. Sometimes it dips in the middle of a week and recovers two days late. Some times it rises on a Friday and sinks on the following Monday and vice-versa.   


Your questions seem a little silly just because they seem misguided for what kind of investing this is. Unless you have a ton of upfront capital to invest, dividends are a long-term game. It has been statistically proven that the people who make the most money in the stock market are people who just put in a routine, regular amount of money every month, regardless of what is actually happening in the market.

My dividend portfolio is 100% stocks (some in high yield bonds so i can cash and average down into dips). Reasons why: 1. No expense ratio 2. when you buy an index you buy the winners AND the losers 3. In general, dividend growth is too slow for growth investors and income is too low for income investors. ETFs are lukewarm middle grounds for investors who don't want to/have time to do research. And there's nothing wrong with that. If you don't have the time or desire to do the research to get a higher return just use ETFs

3. If your brokerage allows for fractional shares, then it should automatically purchase the corresponding percentage that you received.

t3_guoaj6,fsl6mzs,"It will work through fractional shares & the concept of compound interest. Because, especially with major companies, you will still receive dividends off of fractional shares. So, even if you have a .5 share of KO, you would still receive a dividend of .20-ish. Obviously you would purchase more in time, but the hope is that you will own enough shares for the DRIP to buy you more shares in time.

So, as an example, for the KO dividend to buy one share for ""free"", you would need to own around 112 shares (if the price is $46). Obviously this takes a lot of time and finances, but is well worth it if you are a buy and hold investor. This is why stocks like T, OKE, etc. are popular is that it doesn't take too many shares to make the drips earn more shares on themselves. T, for example, only needs about 60 shares for you to ""receive"" a free share off of the DRIP off of dividends earned. This is the strategy I'm hoping to do with KO, T, ET, etc. that it'll just keep buying shares and I won't have to spend any more money investing in the company, and can focus my investments on different companies.

tl;dr: Compound DRIPs will help you earn more dividends in time even on fractional shares. Expensive, but you can get into a cycle where the dividends basically buy you more shares of that company.

t3_gvfb8y,fsoglo6,"This is my psychology and mindset:

I mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses.

Since I intend on holding forever, I must choose well established HIGH-QUALITY BLUE-CHIP DIVIDEND PAYING companies with wide economic moats because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (if not more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity.

People often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid. This will be the responsibility of my future children and my future grandchildren.

Finally, it is often said that the first $1,000,000 is the most difficult to secure. Going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 is easier. But, the easiest is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. My overall intent is to be the guy who fucking sets it all up, educates the next generation, and secure generational wealth for my last name. #thuglifeinvesting #thuglifepersonalfinance",35,1591133487,[],,,
t3_gvfb8y,fsq1je0,"Unless you have a lot of capital up front, large dividends are a long-term destination. What will keep you going every month is adding bit by bit to your future empire. The amount of work that you're doing now to try and cut corners can help you in some ways, but it's going to hurt you in others.   


It sounds like you're going through manic stages thinking about how rich you could be if you bet on just the right horse. I've been there, it's maddening. The truth is that you could....but you almost definitely won't. An investor who invests with their emotions is a bad investor, because the same feeling you get when you buy these high risk stocks will turn into a feeling of panic whenever they do poorly.   


I make less than 30k in a year and in 9 months have saved roughly half my income for investing. My initial investment was about $500 from my savings account, plus $400 from my next paycheck. Every month after that I have put in around $500-600 from my paychecks, plus my tax return $600, plus the majority of the stimulus check since I have a job. I started with $700 and with regular, boring ass monthly contributions, plus re-investing all earned dividends, I have amassed a portfolio currently worth $7,946, which is only a little over $500 below where it was pre-pandemic. Barring any more dividend cuts, this nets me over $400 in dividends this year, which will likely hit $500 before the year's end, and this is with a pretty damn safe portfolio.  


Is that $500 in dividends this year going to take me to financial bliss? No. But that $500 this year will be like getting an entire extra month's worth of money to invest in, for free. Next year, I will start the year with that extra $500 coming down the line, plus whatever I add to it for the next year, hopefully another $500. Then I'm starting my third year with $1000 in dividends. It's a barrel rolling down the hill, picking up speed. I have about 40 years to invest before I hit senior citizen status. In a worst case scenario, if my life situation never improves money wise and I only ever achieve $500 in new dividends each year on top of my pre-existing dividends...I still make at retirement my take home pay right now.   


Statistics have shown that the investors who make the most money are not those who try to time the market, looking for those sweet cheat codes to financial freedom. Instead, the investors who make the most money are the ones who just contribute a regular amount to normal/boring investments every month and never stop.   


There is something to be said for exciting stocks versus boring ones, and that is to say that you should be excited in what you are buying into, but for the right reasons. To me, I see a boring company like LEG or IP and I get excited because I know that they are still going to be in business a decade from now, doing what they're doing, paying me dividends. I also want to buy into companies whose products I like and use, like KO for Coke, UN for Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, T for HBO and Warner Media. But there are also stocks and funds I want to buy into because I legitimately am excited for the work that they do and the potential they have for the future. Those are all things to consider when you are buying a stock. But I think to be the most successful you have to look at the company/fund in these ways, because if you go off of something as volatile as dividend yield it could leave you invested in a company on it's way to disaster.   


By all means, invest in the risky shit, but understand that while all of investing is gambling, that's gambling with your future in a very real way. Keep those stocks to a small amount of your portfolio...use the dividends to buy into safer companies. If they do well you profit regardless, but if they don't do well, it's only a small part of the portfolio. You gotta understand your risk tolerance and learn to stay within those bounds. Keep your regular investments the same but maybe set aside a little money every month just for a risky purchase. At the end of the day, no one can tell you exactly how YOU should be investing, so your best bet is to set goals for yourself that you can readily achieve and then try to hit those goals on a timed basis...weeks, months..whatever. Some sort of metric that shows you are accomplishing goals, that you are making headway, even if it looks like it will take forever...you will have proof that you are making progress. And when you see the numbers increasing and increasing, maybe it will help ease your mind about if you could just cut those corners and invest in all high-yield gambles.",10,1591167797,"[['LEG', 1], ['IP', 1], ['KO', 1], ['T', 1]]",LEG,33.15999984741211,37.650001525878906

**1) XOM/CVX/HAL**

* Oil and gas is in a long-term secular decline. These companies are heavily invested in what is slowly becoming a legacy business. Yes, oil isn't going anywhere right now but we are seeing a progressive shift to renewable energy sources and electric vehicles which will eat into the demand for oil and gas. You may argue that oil is necessary for petrochemical products such as plastics but there are alternative methods out there for producing these same items that are further cutting into the demand for oil.
* These companies carry huge amounts of debt since they are in a highly capital-intensive business (the infrastructure they require is very expensive)
* Profitability of these companies depends on the price of oil which is subject to sudden change/disruption from OPEC/Russia.

&#x200B;

**2) MO**

&#x200B;

* Long term secular decline in industry
* Number of smokers (4-5% annually) will eat into revenues over the long-term. Prices can only be increased so much and can only transiently offset revenue loss from user decline (though I think this will take some time to occur)
* They have made very bad investment decisions in CRON and JUUL (significantly overpaid). This, to me, indicates that management is very desperate and aware of their need to GTFO tobacco ASAP due to the secular decline issue I mentioned
* Their investments may pan out long-term but it's risky nonetheless

&#x200B;

**3) IBM**

&#x200B;

* Terribly indebted
* Has not had any appreciable revenue growth
* Long-term revenue growth is contingent on their successful execution of Red Hat acquisition which carries high risk because they're competing with big boys like Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure)

&#x200B;

**4) T/VZ**

&#x200B;

* Prone to disruption long-term from star-link
* T has a ton of debt
* Anemic revenue growth

**5) IRM**

&#x200B;

* Also experiencing long-term secular decline due to legacy paper business slowing down.
* IRM is trying to get into digital data storage solutions but they are somewhat late to the game and there are lots of other competitors out there (like DLR)
* IRM's revenue growth in future is highly contingent on them pivoting to digital successful and emerging first in the sector.

1. I strongly disagree ""that dividend yield is a calculation to effectively analyze the health of the dividend  and the underlying stock versus its price per share"". I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Does a stock that pays 0% imply a ""healthier"" company than a stock that pays 2%? Does a stock that pays 2% yield imply a ""healthier"" company than one that pays 2.5%? Some companies do not pay dividends at all (yield = 0%), are they the ""healthiest""?
2. Concerning your question as to  ""why wouldn't most investors focus on the amount per share?"". I cannot speak on behalf of the majority of dividend investors; however as a dividend growth investor with a super long-term horizon, I am ultimately looking for a company with a low-mid payout ratio in order to secure a better yield on cost in the far future.

t3_gwzhv7,fsyr954,"Dividend Yield is almost ***always*** calculated on an ANNUAL BASIS.

ANNUAL dividend yield = ANNUAL\_DIVIDEND\_PAYMENTS / stock\_price

Understanding Dividend Yield is very important. So lets do some exercises.

Go to the link above.. Its a list of stocks r/dividends favors.

For each stock, look up its stock price, and how much it pays in dividends per quarter.

Lets do $KO Coke, together

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO?p=KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO?p=KO)

The stock price as of NOW is $47.92

[https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/calendar?symbol=KO](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/calendar?symbol=KO)

I like TD Ameritrade for its dividend calendar (AND NO DAMN ADS) , but yahoo has it too.

The stock calendar says that if you hold the stock before JUNE 12, 2020 (EX-DIVIDEND date) you will be paid $0.41 a share, to be paid into your account on JULY 1, 2020 (PAY DATE). 

Now thats $0.41 per quarter (every 3 months). $0.41 x 4 = $1.64 a year (ANNUAL!!!!)

so your ANNUAL dividend yield = ANNUAL\_DIVIDEND\_PAYMENTS / stock\_price

Annual\_Dividend\_Yield = $1.64 / $47.92

Annual\_Dividend\_Yield = 3.42%

You can kinda think of this yield like an interest payment. You lend Coke $47.92, and they pay you interest of $0.41, every quarter (3 months). This money goes directly into your brokerage account.

Now, do this calculation for a bunch of stocks on that list i sent you.

Keep doing it until you understand what dividend yield is and its relation to the input variables. Do it by hand, with a hand calculator. 

If you did the exercise, then you might notice something.

If the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!

Say that in the mirror to yourself ,a hundred times, every morning.

If the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!

If the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!

If the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!

Now, think of what happened in the last few months.

Dividends are paid with cash. Thus you really need to know the cash the REIT has available to pay the dividend. The best measure of cash is not FFO or AFFO or CAD or even Free Cash Flow (FCF). All of these are used by the media because none of them are GAAP numbers and so are subject to manipulation.

Consolidated Funds From Operations, or CFFO, is a GAAP number, meaning it is the actual accounting of cash available to REIT management after all operational bills have been paid and any changes in working capital accounts that changes the amount of cash available. It is reported each quarter on the Statement of Cash Flows, one of the 3 required financial reports (Income statement and Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet) are the other two) If you subtract from CFFO any preferred dividends and/or distributions to non-controlling interests, what you then have is Net CFFO. This is what common dividends are paid from and is the single best measure of available cash.

For Realty Income, using rolling 4Q (a full 12 months) data, the Net CFFO for for the 4Q ending 1Q20 was ($MM) $1,120 while common dividends paid were $881, for a dividend payout ratio of 78.7%

There may not be any math errors in your calcs but it's probably underestimating the potential growth in high growth stocks, especially over a 30 year period. MSFT from 1990 to 2020 went from ~$1/share to $180+. A high yield stock like T for example has gone from ~$12 to $33 in that same time frame.

What you referring to is dividend yield right.. dividend per share divided by price per share.

High dividend yields are not always better and might reflect several things, for example:

1. Unsustainable payout ratios i.e the company is paying too much of its income in dividends and might cut them in the future
2. Lack of growth opportunities for the business.. if a company doesn't see many opportunities to reinvest in the business they may choose to pay out a higher percentage of income in dividends
3. more mature businesses typically payout higher dividends. once again, these businesses are not growing that much, maybe in line with GDP growth. so the potential for stock price appreciation might be limited.

t3_hiojd2,fwhlbrj,"Lets break down your whole portfolio here., but first:

>I like the 6.5%+ yields

6.5% yields are 9 times out of 10 companies which are not doing so hot. T is the exception, not the rule.  Yield chasing is not how you want to live your life. Nobody makes money yield chasing. Every yield chaser loses money. 

But anyways, lets take a look:

>Energy Transfer

2/10. Sell. Revenue and Profit are soaring, but the dividend is remaining stagnant.  However, the payout ratio is also simultaneously somehow way too high. The company is taking on debt to fund a dividend, when the company isnt even 20 years old. It is always concerning when a young company is taking on debt to pay a dividend. 

This company clearly is either staffed with incompetent management, greedy management who prioritize their own paychecks over the long term health of the company, or some combination of the two. 

Good replacement: Dominion Energy. 

>Chimera

0/10. Sell. Similar to ET. Debt to fund the dividend is never healthy. Except this company is actually reducing its dividend while still taking on debt to fund the reduced dividend.  This is how companies enter death spirals.

 In 2010 it paid out $.76 a share. Yet now you are getting $0.30 a share in 2020. Sell out and write this loss off.

Good replacement: Home Depot (add some diversity to your portfolio)

>Altria

3/10. Sell. Cigarettes are a dirty business.  They are all effectively squeezing blood from a stone right now. The smoking population has been going nothing but down for decades. The addictive properties of cigarettes make for a good recurring customer base, but unfortunately cigarettes have a tendency to kill their best customers. Rapid price increases are leading to record profits now, but they are pricing out potential new customers. Smoking rates for young people are at historic lows, and just keep getting lower. Eventually, this company will start to slide, then it will be nothing but down.   Due to the taxes on cigarettes, decreasing the price is virtually impossible.

I would stay away from the industry as a whole, because once the slide starts, it will never stop. 

Good replacement: Kimberly Clark. The women in your life need tampons, and the babies of the world need diapers. Kimberly Clark is a market leader in both.

>ATT

I'm actually pretty bullish on AT&T. Management hadnt been held accountable for quite some time, but now someone is holding their feet to the fire, and the company looks poised to clean itself up. Even if it doesn't, the dividend is well covered by earnings and the company has an IP library rivalled only by Disney.

Companion pick: Verizon.  I like T and Verizon to be equal weight in my portfolio.

>Enterprise

I would hold for right now and see which way the wind blows. Lots of debt to fund prior dividends. Company looks like it is trying to turn itself around. 

Replacement if the company regresses: Microsoft. Well diversified tech company.

>Universal

Don't really have strong opinions on this one to make a definitive judgement. I haven't looked at the numbers enough. I would compare and contrast it with Disney, then pick whichever has the better balance sheet. 

>SImon properties

Just announced a dividend cut. No thank you. Plenty of REITs out there with a balance sheet able to weather the storm.

Good replacement: O. The company speaks for itself. 

>Exxon,

Oil is a dying breed propped up by the US government. Every major utility company that relies on oil has promised to phase out oil in the next decade or two.

t3_hiojd2,fwi1lee,"To analyze safe dividends, pay attention to the following ten points:

1. Dividend Coverage: Does the company have enough money to pay the dividend?
2. Dividend Growth: A company growing its dividends consistently is a great indicator of financial and operational health.
3. Earnings/Free Cash Flow Growth: A company’s cash floe must coincide with dividend growth. If cash flow does not grow with the dividend, the company cannot afford to grow its dividend indefinitely.
4. Interest Coverage: Can the company pay its debt? Interest Coverage compares the company’s  earnings to the interest expense on debt. It is ideal for earnings to be at least twice that of its interest expense. A score of 26 is excellent and indicates earnings far exceed debt.
5. Debt To Equity Ratio: A higher score is a better score. The higher a specific securities’ percentile, the better.
6. Credit Rating: The better the rating, the better a company’s credit worthiness as a borrower. This indicates a good ability to pay back debts, which is itself a good indicator of good financial position.
7. Prior Recession Performance: Did the company collapse? Did the stock take a hit? Did it rebound? A longer history is often a good indicator of health. Companies like Visa only went public in 2008, so there is not much information on Visa in this regard.
8. Cyclicality: General Mills has smooth and steady earnings. People want to constantly eat their food products. On the other hand, clothing stores
9. Dividend Longevity: How long has the company paid the dividend? Have they consistently paid dividends?
10. Company Values, Culture, and Commitment to Dividends: Realty Income (O) is all about dividends—it is a culture of dividends and commitments to investors.",9,1593541616,[],,,

Couple things that I've learned over the past few months of fucking with stocks, reading everything i can understand on investopedia from the ground up, etc:

1. Don't chase yields. 4% IS worth it because it leaves room for the company to grow, instead of paying all their profits in dividends. That 4% is going to come back to you over the course of 25 quarters. If that dividend grows past 4% you're looking at even less time until you're getting free money. If you chase, you risk way overpaying because stock price tends to go up closer to EX day. 

2. Diversity is key, especially with just about everything susceptible to Covid. If you have 100k at your disposal, I highly recommend buying at least a couple shares of Amazon, NVDA, AAPL and MSFT. You're not likely to regret those purchases. (Go ahead. Light me up for saying buy amazon! I deserve it!)

3. Don't spend it all in one day or all in one minute. 930 to 1030 am prices tend to be the highest. Fridays tend to have a slide at the end of the day because some people never hold over the weekend. Wait for opportunity to strike. 

4. Most important for last; Do your own research. I say this not to be a dick, but why trust me telling you to buy AMZN AAPL MSFT and NVDA? Buy shares in companies that you know will be around for a long time. Learn PB ratio, PE ratio, Debt equity ratio, etc. So that you know how to value a company and so you can make the determination of whether or not they're overvalued or undervalued or right on par.

Meanwhile a stock like XOM which pays out dividends in excess of its earnings and has been taking on a lot of.leverage may not only have a stagnant dividend but stands a chance of cutting its dividend  (like RDS did recently). 

V, MA, 5G REITs (CCI, AMT, DLR), MSFT, ABBV, QCOM should be on your radar IMO. 

I would also consider higher growth REITS and Utilities like ELS, NEE, D. 

With that much money, if you're not up for all the research and commitment of time to research all these companies you should consider ETFs like...

for growth and a little yield:  VGT, QQQ, VHT

for little bit more yield and some modest growth in dividend: VYM, VPU,",5,1593789571,"[['XOM', 1], ['QCOM', 1]]",XOM,43.93000030517578,42.709999084472656

Higher yield = More risk in general. Especially in individual stocks.

With all the noise about a market correction, but that could be in another 10 YEARS!!! are you gonna leave that money in the bank and get paid a few pennies for 10 years?

This is mainly due to the annual contribution limit of only $6000. Since the Canadian government seems to change the maximum deposit amount every few years, I think the best strategy would be to Max out the contribution (if you can) until you have 120% of one year's worth of living expenses saved up in there. 

Now, take the part of the portfolio's amount which should be equivalent to 1 year's expenses and put it in the safest assets you can that are tied directly to inflation. This will be your emergency fund. If you lose your job and need to survive off savings, these assets are what you will draw from.

The other part of your portfolio (equivalent to 20% of a year's expenses), take it and invest in buy & forget dividend stocks. Companies which will outlive us all.  Waste Management, Stanley Black and Decker, Hormel, Toronto Dominion Bank, CNI, etc. Companies you don't need to think about. These companies will grow your emergency fund to reflect cost of living increases that are not inflation related. 

Say you have a major change in lifestyle that dramatically increases your expenses (like having kids).  That's okay. Your unused contributions roll over to the next year with no limit, so you could just top up your account to maintain the ratios. Just remember to reinvest every cent of your dividends. Don't touch the account and if you get married, sign a prenup that exempts it from divorce. Guard that account more than your house.

Find a handful of quality monthly divs that you can watch the last 5-10yrs. If you see any negative decline don't even think about it. Stability or positive growth (at least prior to march 2020). Stick with 4-7% yield for these. Then look for a handful of quality quarterly div ETFs like the same above (4-7%).

Then, invest in 3-5 quality long term, high rated, 4/5 Morningstar rated ""Growth"" Dividend stocks.

First of all, your communications sector stocks face the potential of serious long-term disruption from StarLink if it’s successfully executed by Elon Musk. T and VZ wouldn’t be able to offer anywhere near the same quality of service as the StarLink program and may see major revenue drop as a result. Of course, this is nowhere near an immediate concern but something to keep in mind going into the future.

Second, I’m going to have to disagree with cutting CVS. I think CVS’s attempts to vertically integrate their business are going to prove successful in the long-run. CVS has been on the decline for the past few years for the same reason as WBA: Declining gross margin on pharmaceutical products (which btw make up a pretty significant portion of each company’s revenue). I believe that by getting into the insurance game CVS will be able to diversify their revenue stream. 

Another risk to CVS/WBA in general is also going to be Amazon. Amazon is looking to get into the pharmaceutical industry as well and they have tendency of wiping the floor with their competitors through aggressive underpricing. Also, Amazon is expanding their distribution and delivery network considerably and many Americans would appreciate the convenience of being able to have their medications delivered to their doorstep without having to walk into a pharmacy.

as you said, with growth stocks it's an issue because if you over diversify, you're limiting how much you have in the stocks that do rocket to the moon, which costs you money via missed opportunity. with dividend stocks though, 7% all in one one stock pays the same as being spread over 20 companies all paying 7%. diversification just covers you in the  event one of your holdings slashes the dividends or goes bankrupt.

of course, this is an over simplified viewpoint of things as it narrowly focuses on return and ignores the possibility of dividend stocks also having growth in share value. other than that, the  only other thing to keep in mind is that just because various companies have the same payouts today doesn't mean that 5 years from now they will all increase their dividends at the same rate.

For instance, I originally had a REIT that paid me $48 a year for 20 shares...my taxable amount on that would have been around $5 a year, which is a totally fine trade off.   


As the qualified dividends guy I gotta recommend SCHD. I don't have it in my portfolio, but only because I also have set my portfolio to DRIP and my broker doesn't yet allow me to DRIP SCHD, so I have it's more expensive, slightly worse cousin, VIG. If at some point SCHD becomes fractional/DRIPable to me then I am switching my VIG investment over. Lots of people love O, and with good reason, but if I just had money to throw at an investment once in awhile I would throw it into a market ETF so that you don't have to pay much attention to what's going on. Just plug your money into SCHD and keep on going.",3,1598152783,[],,,

 > Unlike most REITs, which invest in properties and rent them out, AGNC buys securities, specifically mortgage-backed securities, which are guaranteed by the U.S. government.

 > The mortgage REIT sector was put through the wringer early in the COVID-19 crisis as credit dried up, and many REITs were forced to unload assets at fire-sale prices. Every mortgage REIT cut its dividend and reported a significant drop in book value per share. Some eliminated the dividend completely.

 > AGNC management mentioned on its second quarter earnings call that, in hindsight, AGNC probably didn't need to cut the dividend from $0.15 a month to $0.12 a month. The crisis for the mortgage REIT sector may not be over, but while most have completely changed their business models, AGNC survived the crisis without being forced to do that. ANGC Investment's 10% dividend yield is attractive enough, but the stock also trades at a 6% discount to its book value of $14.92. Since mortgage REITs generally trade right around book value, this is a second source of potential return, which gives AGNC potential as a value stock as well as a dividend stock.

 > The assets AGNC holds have largely returned to normal courtesy of the Fed's buying, which means a dividend hike or buyback could be in the future. There are many ways to win in this stock.

- RNP. Get rid of this tomorrow.  A 2% expense ratio is an abomination upon all things good and holy. I dont care what they are promising you. They are robbing you blind.

- Pembina. I get they have a monthly dividend but girl they are running up massive debts to give you that dividend. I'd recommend you cash out.

- Western Digital. This company is bleeding money.

- Texas Instruments. Aside from the calculators, they aren't really going anywhere.

worth mentioning, over-diversification is going to be more of a problem for a growth stock based strategy than it would be with dividend stocks. this is because when you have a growth based strategy, you're spreading your money more ways and if one company hits it big, you're not going to have much in there if you're too over diversified. with a growth strategy, you're earning your money by the shares appreciating in value so you want as much as possible in the companies that do hit and the hope is that the hits outweigh the misses.

on the dividend side, that risk doesn't really apply. your gains aren't going to come from a company hitting it big, it's going to come from your companies continuing to exist and pay out consistently. being spread thinner is arguably a good thing because it minimizes how much of a hit you take if one company slashes their payout (like many companies did this year). since a dividend strategy isn't going to see the next tesla where one of your holdings shoots through the roof, you're not going to be passing up large potential gains by being more diverse.

on a side note, keep in mind that reits are your highest holding by sector, and reits get taxed more harshly than most other stocks (because they are ""ordinary dividends"" and are taxed at short term capital gains rate instead of ""qualified dividends"" that are taxed at long term rates). or at least in the us that's the case. not sure what country you're from.",2,1599693455,"[['TSLA', 1]]",TSLA,360.55999755859375,437.7900085449219

If you want to learn more about some popular dividend ETFs and their performance, check out Dividend Growth Machine on youtube. He's currently doing a series where he goes through all the major dividend ETFs and breaks down all the important aspects of them.

Even if you're interested in picking individual stocks (like myself) I'd still recommend at least 50% of your total holdings in ETFs (I'm at about 60% ETFs personally).

- competition: cisco's product offering is all over the place. Due to lack of focus they're doing a bunch of things, but becoming worst and worst in each segment.

- they had very solid networking hardware and that was their core product. They didn't embrace cloud tech as fast as they should have and now face competition from nearly every player out there. From Microsoft to juniper to cumulus to f5.

- their move to the software and security market was abysmal, IMHO. Yes they have a lot of customers who could just get an upsell to their VPN, etc. But many opt out for more modern and less expensive solutions.

I believe QQQX is a 50/50 blend of the QYLD model and Naz100 itself. It'll pay less than QYLD in dividends (probably about 50% of what QYLD pays) because QQQX only writes calls on half of their Naz100 holdings.... however, when the Naz100 rises quickly, the other half of QQQX's Naz100 holdings will ride along for the ride skyward, while QYLD will have their holdings ""called away"" and then have to buy their Naz100 shares back at higher prices. So, a 50/50 blend of QYLD/QQQ does offer a balance of these strategies & their respective pro's & con's.

WARNING: Investing in either or both of these two ETFs (in any combination) means that you are still highly correlated with Naz100, which means that QYLD & QQQX will both take a hit when Naz100 goes down. Here's a chart of their price movements:

You can also go after some dividend-paying stocks. $T, $KO, $JNJ, and $MSFT are just a few. Some of them will definitely have a bit more value than others.

However, at your age, I'd definitely consider going mostly into growth stocks. If you're wanting to pay for a home, you want to build your principal. Dividend stocks pay a nice dividend, and it does compound if you DRIP, but the return could be significantly lower than investing in a solid growth stock.

My strategy has always been to build my principal as quickly as possible. When I first started investing, I didn't care too much about dividends. I invested heavily in stocks that I felt would grow and beat any growth that came from dividend-paying stocks. Now, I have a pretty nice principal and I sold off some growth stocks in exchange for dividend-paying stocks to build a nice foundation.

But to go along with what you're saying, you can still get quality and spaced out dividend payments, although its not as easy as just buying a bunch of monthly payers. 

For example lets look at September over the past 5 years: 

JNJ has paid out on the 8th-10th

MCD has paid out on the 15th-17th

PEP has paid out on the 28th-30th

They also follow similar schedules for the other months they pay out (except PEP pays in Jan instead of Dec). So that's roughly 4 months where you're getting 3 dividend payouts throughout the month. You could repeat the process for the other sets of months by first finding quality companies and then opting for the ones that best fit your intended payout schedule.

At least, that's what I would do if I was looking to evenly space out income.... I'd find quality companies I'd be interested in owning long term first, and then decide on which ones to invest in based on payouts after.

With that said I typically recommend three ETFs:

- SCHD - dow dividend payers
- SPHD - s&p dividend payers, +monthly, + REITs. It is facing some difficulty right now, but this is where I hope fund managers will make appropriate decisions, if the fund indeed tracks what it promises.

MLPs are partnership units, not shares. They pay distributions, not dividends. Their distributions outlined on the K-1 for the tax year, will be an assortment of capital gains, interest, ordinary income but mostly, return of principal, due to their very high depreciation expenses. This return of principal will reduce your basis and the net loss the MLP declares each year will be 'stored' until you sell your units, then it can be used against gains on sale.

t3_j2u8xu,g77xif6,"Here are some more general guidelines which I sincerely believe that everyone should have ingrained in their heads when formulating their personal strategy:

1. Pay no respect to volatility of the markets. Who fucking cares about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, ""all time highs"", ""all time lows"" or wherever the fuck we are on the ""graph"". You should not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, you should not care at all. Volatility should not mean anything to you since you should be a super long-term investor.
2. You cannot predict the future and you cannot time the market. ""Time in the market"" is superior to ""timing the market"" as per academic studies. Therefore, you should invest as much as you can every time you get paid while while balancing a decent quality of life (whatever that means to you). Basically, don't try to pull off some ""smart shit"" by pulling out your money because you think the markets will crash and then put your money back into the market after it crashes to capitalize on that hypothetical situation in your little head. Turn off your brain and keep your money in the markets because again, ""time in the market"" is superior to ""timing the market"" as per academic studies.
3. You should consider investing in an ""index exchange traded fund"" or ""index-ETF"" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index-ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors who pick stocks will under perform an index-ETF over the long-term.
4. Don’t day trade. Don't try to ""get rich quick"". Don't try to ""buy low, sell high"". Don't buy shit/garbage. Don't buy ""meme stocks"". Don't worry about ""missing out"". Build wealth slowly over time as this is a long-term game and not a short-term or medium-term game.
5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity because everything goes on sale which includes high-quality companies and index-ETFs; and therefore, you get to buy more stuff at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them instead because these are the times which can actually accelerate you towards your financial goals quicker.
6. Again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics/elections, wars, recessions, poverty, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in buying index-ETFs or purchasing well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until you retire or die.
7. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is ""different"" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks about volatility).

Dividend growth is a great signal of a company's own evaluation of its future. High yield can mean other things, although some stocks are meant to be high yield due to what they do and how they're taxed by the government.

1. If you want to set it and forget it I would prefer an ETF. The difference between ETFs and individual stocks is risk. For an ETF your money is more spread out and should typically go with the market. Individual stocks are businesses so if they go out of business that obviously changes your return. For an ETF realistically a 6-12% annual return would be about normal. But investing in 10 stocks your portfolio could fluctuate down 50% or up 50% a year. 

I would say if you do hold O it’s better to hold in a ROTH for tax reasons.

2. Nothing will clearly outperform one or the other. When I went through my options I went with VOO. But about everyone here will tell you slightly different VTI and SCHD are pretty common picks here.

3. HSA is 3x tax beneficial, Roth and 401k are 2x. Roth if your taxes will get higher over time (salary should go up over time) and 401k in specific situations if it can get you to a lower tax bracket. Another benefit often not mentioned is 401k and HSA can be taken straight from your paycheck and ROTH is manually after getting paid. So automate as much as you can unless you are a creature of habit and can handle manually.

Currently I max out my HSA, max out my wife and my ROTH. 7% into 401k and 3% match. Than dollar cost average the rest into a taxable brokerage.",6,1603565594,"[['O', 1]]",O,59.279998779296875,59.97999954223633

If you sell monthly covered call ATM on Nasdaq 100 yourself, you will learn that the premium is around 3.3 %, QYLD only pays 1 % of that money to you, the rest it uses to make sure the fund doesn't go down.

The reason why it goes down because it writes ATM covered call so naturally if market is declining it will go down trying to maintain consistent income. However, since it has a driving force of going up 2.3% per month, I wouldn't worry it just decline and die like many MLPs out there.

1-The 2020 market has been very unkind to companies that have been paying unsupportable dividends. Research resources/books have not generally kept up with this reality. Survivors that did not cut their dividends in 2020 get extra credit for it when I evaluate for purchase. 

2-Cash is King, in all contexts. Companies manipulate data all the time, but a cash or DRIP dividend cannot be ""fudged"". Dividends are a more accurate and honest metric than any other, in my book.  

3-REIT's, MLP's, and BDC's should be included for discussion in your intro. Their structures are built to include dividends and dividends are not really optional for these.

The dividend hasn't increased from its last cut in 2017 and its ATH was over a decade ago (2006/7 IIRC). You can count on the stability and reliable dividends if you're chasing the dividends like me. Long term parking your money could be bad if they chop their dividends again.",3,1605188316,[],,,

t3_jz1ds0,gd9bfoa,"I was on the same boat as you, but then I realized I could have a more stable and larger income with the same investment using options. 

My strategy is ""The Wheel"" or ""Triple Income investing"" (which I've modified to be Pentuple income investing). 

I'll break down as simple as possible for those new to the concept. 

I pick a stock that has a dividend pay out that I wouldn't mind holding. Then I sell a ""Cash Covered Put"" what this is, is essentially me going to someone with 100 shares of the stock and saying ""Hey your stock is gonna go up"" and they say ""I'm not so sure"". So I sell them insurance. They pay a ""Premium"" and if the stock falls below the ""Strike Price"" we agree on, I HAVE to buy the shares at the strike price, regardless of how low it goes. Now if it doesn't go below the strike price, I keep the premium, they keep the shares.

The goal in this first step is to NOT get assigned the shares, so you tend to be conservative with the put. However, with $5k cash on hand, you can expect around $100 in premium per week playing relatively safe puts. You're never going to get a dividend return like that. 

Now, IF I lose (and it does happen) I will be assigned the shares. Oh well. I overpaid for some stock, hopefully not by a lot. (Remember I have to buy regardless of how low it goes). Now that I have the stock, I can eat the loss and start again, or I can do the second step of the wheel. 

Step 2: I use those shares to sell a ""Covered Call"". This is where I go to someone who wants to BUY 100 shares of the stock I hold, and they think it's gonna go up by a lot. I say ""Ya right"" and then sell them the opportunity to buy the shares at a lower strike price than they think it will get to. They pay me a premium for this opportunity. 

Once again, if the shares reach above the strike price, I am obligated to sell them at the strike price, regardless of how high it goes. If the shares do not reach the strike when the contract expires, I keep them and the premium. 

The goal again can be to sell or not sell depending on how much I like the stock. 

Once I'm wrong on this part of the wheel, I sell the shares at the strike price, which is ideally more than I paid in the first step. Meaning I got premium from Step 1 and Step 2 and then income from the sale in the call. AKA - Triple income. 

How I modify it is pretty simple. I pick stocks that pay dividends. When the Ex date is coming up, I make the goal to get assigned or keep the shares, so I can collect the dividend payment as well as premium. (That's income source 4). 

Then I take all premium and gains and use them to invest into ""Safe Bet"" dividend payers - (Income source 5). 


It is much riskier than playing the dividend game, but if you're young and have time to bounce back from a loss - and of course you don't use ALL your money to play this strategy, you should theoretically come out ahead more times than you lose. You'll be able to collect a pretty decent amount weekly, and over time build positions much, much faster. 

The downside - If an event like march happens, you're going to lose BIG, but at the end of the day, for better or worse, you'll still get assigned some shares of stock. So long as the company does not go out of business, you'll live to fight another day - and let's be real if you were holding dividend stocks during an event like covid crash you were gonna lose big anyway.",76,1606077301,[],,,

Of the top 10 companies it holds (about 30% of holdings), only one, MSFT, pays a dividend, and that is only about a 1% yield. Instead of dividends, it primarily uses capital gains for its distributions ($1.685 being its last (2019?) capital gain distribution) made in December, which means the other 11 month distributions of $1.65 will have some dividends but will likely be primarily ROC. 

Funds or pass through entities like some REITs or BDCs whose annual distributions are largely capital gains tend to look stellar when the market is cooperating and like big wads of crap when the market is not cooperating.

If reliable dividends are what you're after, positive cash flows from companies who provide what we need/want through all manner of market cycles are where your reliable dividends come from.

t3_k1gh42,gdo7h4u,"Nintendo. Also it’s best to pick them up on years they do terrible. Nintendo can’t be beat even on their terrible years. Their goal is to be profitable both with their games and their consoles. They have enough money from all their profits to fail for 100 years in a row and still have money left over to fail. So they have the best chance at succeeding in subsequent years 

They always have a fresh supply of consumers aka kids and they always have adults seeking nostalgia and/or are gamers themselves. They have consumers out there who played the Wii who in a few gens might pick up one of Nintendo’s consoles for multipurpose uses 

As for the others CD projekt red doesn’t have that brand appeal with their own name only the games they supply so when someone picks up the Witcher they don’t really automatically think of CD unlike Nintendo when you pull any of their staple games you think Nintendo. 

One of the best things about Blizzard is exactly what the other guy said. They have such a high loyalty base you can’t go wrong there. But Blizzard however is a bit niche as a company. It’s only recently that they’ve been branching out into other gaming genres and so far it’s helping them immensely. That coupled with the 10-20 year wait by the fan base for a quality game title  is impressive. However one of the problems now is one of the main leadership folks stepped down recently and fans have started to pull out because instead of being Blizzard and Actvision working together as partners it’s becoming more of the former Actvision cash grab which is turning off a lot of the loyal fan base (and is not a smart idea and why you don’t see Nintendo pulling an EA micro transaction on everything they own)

Ubisoft I like because they like Nintendo try to be innovative by taking risks to support different types of game genres and platforms. We wouldn’t have seen Assassin’s Creed or Rayman if they didn’t.  However one of their problems is they tend to milk a series excessively. Instead of doing what Nintendo does aka using their mascots in other genres and creating a staple brand Ubisoft creates the same game type with their characters to the point where the series becomes very stale in a short amount of time.

  28 years old, government job with a great pension plan, $35k in a separate retirement portfolio fund that tracks the NASDAQ. $20k in my reno/rainy account. This stuff is not being touched.

  However I have an account with $12k that is for individual stocks. This is the account I struggle to create a proper strategy for. Below is how I rationalize my portfolio decisions instead of yolo throwing money at meme stocks.I picture the stock market as a party. Not saying I invented this thought process, but stick with me..

Everyones at this party. 

  You've got your popular, wild and unpredictable crowd who are the life of the party, but sometimes breaks stuff or throws up on your couch. (TSLA, PLTR, NIO, etc..).
 
  You've got your cool, fun loving crowd that keeps 
you on your toes (FAANG, etc...). 
 
  Then theres your every day, average joe crowd that nobody has beef with but aren't overly excited to have there either (JNJ, MMM, LMT, etc...). 
  
  Finally there are the wallflowers, nerds and weirdos. This crowd is either ostracized, ignored or simply hated (GIS, MO, T, HSY, CPB, etc...). Some of them just don't make themselves noticed, some of them aren't trendy enough to hang with and seem out of touch with the theme of the party. Others are simply hated and are picked on and pushed around.

The point of all of this is to ask yourself one question.

You are the owner of the house, it's your party. Who's getting invited and why?

 Do you want to have an extravagant party with the most wild, popular crowd you can imagine, knowing that it could get broken up at any moment (TSLA PE 1000+ lol). Or is a more chilled out party with no chance of noise complaints, drama or puke more your thing?

Neither is wrong in my humble opinion, both have their time and place, as well as healthy amounts at every party. I want my party to be fun (ETSY, SQ) but I don't want to risk burning my house down in the process. I want a mix of everyone at my party. I dont want everyone there to be a bunch of wall flowers sitting around not doing anything most of the time (GIS, MO, HSY, etc...). Always good to have some old faithful friends there too who can still have fun (WMT, JNJ, LMT, AAPL, etc...).

Not that I make this much on yield, but that's the plan. But I know you can withdraw contributions early, just not profits churned.

I'm a ""bad things will eventually happen"" person though. I don't like paying taxes on my stock income, such as it is, but like the other poster said I hope to make use of it before 59.5. Besides which, it is not far fetched to think the government would eventually lift that age cap to 70 or something. They are currently trying to make Social Security only available to people practically at death's door so I don't have much faith in the longevity of tax shelters.

Taxable has more obvious drawbacks... Roth IRAs might be tweeked to bite you in the ass later on.

Lots of people hold both, though. Just remember if you hold things in a taxable account it isn't hard to turn off DRIP and use those funds to cover the taxes in Q4.",4,1606700440,[],,,

An ADR/ADS is a bank issued certificate that guarantees you the performance and distributions of a foreign stock (i.e. bank owns the stock, but guarantees you that it passes along all gains to you). Since you might not be able to trade this stock on on its native exchange, this might be the only way you get access to it. This guarantee is then traded on a different exchange by the bank to investors.

One note is that some ADR represent more than one stock to get the price point more in range with what is usual for US markets. For example Russian stocks typically are nominated in the cent range, not because they are worth less, they just have more shares for cheaper prices commonly, but for foreign investors it's rather odd to buy stocks for 10 cents or so, and also it's not so nice to break up 10.25 cents per share, so a lot of those ADR just bundle 10, 20 or whatever many shares and expose it as one ADR share.

The downside overall of ADRs are that there might be fees passed on to you (payment to the bank for this service), although lots of ADR are ""sponsored"" so the company pays the fees because it wants the foreign investors, and there are some risks related to the issuer (the bank), plus the usual risks that go along with investing in stocks.",2,1606977549,[],,,

At the end of the day it all stems for why you are investing. I’m 24 and so I am very willing to have riskier “growth” stocks that would appreciate.

You know you don't get to participate in profits beyond your preferred dividends.

Preferred are more secure than commons in the event of bankruptcy, but if a bankruptcy does occur, you're almost certain to get wiped out as well, compared to lower yielding bonds which have are often first to the table when divying up a bankrupt companies estate.

The dividend on a preferred can be suspended. It's that if dividends are paid, preferred holders get their first before common stock holders. There are cummulative preferred, where any missed payments accrue and also need to be repaid before commons receive anything.

t3_k8hfpn,gf0bprl,"This really is a neglected question. Thanks for asking it.

My views on preferred and bonds:

Nothing wrong with them except for the fact companies are issuing them to begin with to the public markets. People don't even like it when companies issue additional shares... much less preferred or bonds unless it is in private placement.

If a company is offering debt to the public market, that means something. It's normal enough but nevertheless a signal that their debt might be more valuable than their equity.

Corporate bonds can default. You can make money by investing in corporate bonds, but they can default. 

Look at some REITs. Realty Income doesn't have any public bonds or preferred to my knowledge, while Gladstone Commercial and Monmouth do (they did issue like a billion dollars in notes this year but that is something banks would buy). Some companies don't have to issue them. Others do. There's a worry that investing in the companies that have to offer them already suggests a company struggling for extra money.

Personally this space is much better if you enter it via CEFs like HYT. The capital stack only means something in the event a company is at risk of bankruptcy or other declines. You get paid first or second. In a healthy company you should go for its equity, not its debt instruments. If you go for its debt instruments you might as well admit it isn't a safe company to begin with.

Preferred stock CEFs can also be a nice place to park money. PGX is quite stable. But they select the instruments for you.

Bonds are OTC. Individuals shouldn't be buying them or any OTC products. That is all caveat emptor.",2,1607391660,[],,,

Timing the market is often a losing proposition. Your best bet is to DCA (Dollar Cost Average) the stocks, purchase securities you plan to hold for the long term and not think too hard about it. 

My advice for anyone getting started - Treat investing like a bill. Take $5 or $10 a week (or month if that's all you can swing, no judgement) and invest it using a platform that allows fractional shares (I know Robinhood does for sure, not sure about others). If you're just starting and don't want to do the work of research, invest into ETFs - SPY, SPHD, SPCD, QQQ, VYM, VOO, VTI, VGT, VXUS, VWO are all some ETFs to look at. 

An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an organization that takes money and invests into a broad spectrum of stocks and assets. Some of them pay dividends too (SPHD and VYM for example). So by investing into these you're both 1) Diversified, and 2) Having your money actively managed by people who do this professionally (no guarantee they'll be right of course).

Your stakes in T and ABBV are too high I think. Make them lower than 7%. If ABBV and T go down 5% in one day, your portfolio will take a huge hit. 

I'd take out Amazon and invest in a tech company that pays a proper dividend. It seems your heavy weight on T and ABBV are making up for it. MSFT and Apple are good alternatives, increase them to 7% too. (MSFT, APPL, and AMZN all follow each other usually day to day). One company I personally recommend is a REIT called Digital Realty.

t3_kgft5m,ggfohiu,"From 2009 - 2017 (during Obama’s presidency) the price went from ~7 to ~24.  This stock typically tanks right before and during an election cycle, then bounces back no matter who wins election.  This has happened multiple times in its almost 30 years as a public company.

The div payout is not only high because of the price decline, but because it is a REIT.  It has to pay a certain percentage.

I jumped in on this one earlier this summer, have listed to both earnings calls since purchasing, and feel management knows what they are doing as they’ve dealt with these situations for literally decades.

They are also diversifying into rehabilitation, halfway houses, and tracking/monitoring.

I prefer private industry to government run operations.

Finally, pay attention to the large insider purchases this year.  They KNOW it is undervalued and are taking advantage of everyone’s obsession with tech to invest in more in an industry that has a lot less disruption potential.",13,1608433037,[],,,
t3_kgft5m,ggee7h8,"Personally it’s a bad deal. One the dividend payout is ridiculously high and that’s the result of a declining stock. The stock price is where it was right around 2006 and other than the period between 2006 and now the stock has never been that high 

Looking at the political situation between covid and sentiment about prisons the US has significantly shifted their perceptions about keeping people locked up. California in particular has shed a good chunk of 50k inmates over the past 10 years with half of it coming due to covid. California also recalled all of their out of state inmates that were in private prisons

The public itself at this point has shifted to rehabilitation over continued incarceration. While Biden initially signed the bill increasing incarceration he tends to go with the flow of popular opinion so he likely will increase releases. If not through another law then through pardons and commutations. If he can’t shutter a private prison he can reduce how many people go there. He might even have the ability to change the contract language the next time the contracts are up for renewal 

Assuming the dividend doesn’t go down you might get lucky to hit $36k assuming the stock goes up to $13 

A few things you are doing though is painting a very rosy picture. When you look at their earnings they’re on a bit of a decline. They actually saw a decline between 2019 and 2020 and this is a 24/7 facility that can’t be impacted by the pandemic 

One thing recently to be mindful of is the feds under the current President is already not renewing contracts: The GEO Group, Inc. (NYSE: GEO) (""GEO"") announced today that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has decided to not rebid the contract for the company-owned, 1,450-bed Rivers Correctional Facility in North Carolina, which is set to expire on March 31, 2021. The contract for the Rivers Correctional Facility generated approximately $43 million in annualized revenues for GEO. GEO expects to market the Rivers Correctional Facility to other federal and state agencies

They’re expecting a lower EPS going into the next quarter. As a result of that and other factors their dividends are declining as well. The height of their dividend was back in 2016. Since then it’s been on a marked decline with significant cuts to dividend price

While they might be turning a profit today I don’t expect that to be the case always unless they can convert their facilities to move toward inmate rehabilitation instead of inmate incarceration. They say they are the premier rehab facility and if that were true the stock should be booming but it’s not. So until they make changes I would be avoiding this especially with the really high volatility that comes along with it aka one day you might hit $13 a share and the next it could drop down to $8 or lower

It’s not as difficult as people make it out to be. However, it can be a huge burden if you start investing in tons of them. So I would advise avoiding several of them.

As others have said, TurboTax and similar software can easily handle these forms. You might need to do a bit of reading on handling your first one though, but it’s not bad.

They’re not called dividends when it’s an MLP, they’re called distributions. This is because you don’t pay tax on those payouts-right now. They return capital to you. For example: you buy $2,000 worth of an MLP stock and get $100 back in distributions that year. Your cost basis is now $1,900. So if you sell it later for $2,500, your capital gain will be $600. This can actually be advantageous for many people because if you hold it for longer than a year you will get long term capital gain rates.

t3_kilt2r,ggtqeqc,"I am invested in T, and while I am bullish on them I do have concerns about their management. I do love that they are looking to unload Dish, just write that off as a huge loss because that industry is dying and 15 billion plus getting rid of the debt associated is a fairly decent return considering the context of the situation they find themselves in. That 15 billion in cash can help them invest in their 5G network and HBO Max while at the same time lowering their debt load 13.8 billion by unloading Dish's debt. 

I am also concerned about T's 5G capabilities and the increased competition from T-Mobile along with the management's rumored unloading of entertainment assets which I think is a huge mistake. Overall I think their dividend is covered short term in the next 5-7 years which is good but longer term there could be larger squeezes on that dividend that could result in cuts which will tank the principle. 

However I do like HBO Max's long term potential after a shaky start, T has stable revenue streams from cell service and internet service along with their media assets which should stabilize long term. I also like how they have shrunk their debt 15% since their highest point and how if free cash flow can sustain its self they should be able to both pay down debt and maintain the dividend. 

What concerns me is that they might not have the cash to both service their dividend, pay down their debt and invest in their business interests on the media and 5G side. However I do think that selling Dish and its debt would help alleviate that as it would lower their debt and give them a pile of cash to invest into their business longer term.",3,1608752222,"[['T', 1]]",T,28.5,28.799999237060547

My personal investment strategy is to contribute to my 401k at company match, then max out Roth, then contribute to a normal brokerage account. Reason being that I don't want to work until I'm 70 either, and since you can't withdraw from retirement accounts early (without penalty) I want another source of income, hence the brokerage account.",4,1608775509,[],,,
t3_kj5t1b,ggv4pxg,"Step 1: Considering that Robinhood is discontinuing support for REITs like O, I would suggest leaving the platform, as your investment research may take you further into REITS.  It is my firm belief  that your choice of brokerage should empower your investments, not serve as a hinderance.  Even if O remains the only REIT in your portfolio, the company is such a powerful investment that I would jump ship simply to keep it in your portfolio.  Whether you can transfer your account or not is dependent on what the brokerages say.  Some have restrictions.  If you have to sell a few securities for a loss, you can still use it as a tax write-off, so even in death, every investment has value.

Step 2: Check your 401k.  Read the fine print.  More and more 401k plans are allowing the usage of 3rd party brokerages.  If so, check to see which ones are allowed.  Never go with the default option, since most of those still charge commissions.  Get yourself either an M1, Schwab, Fidelity, etc. account with commission free trading and sync it to your 401k plan if you can.  Simply having all your investments with one brokerage is incredibly powerful, and will simplify your tax paperwork.  

Step 3: Whether you even want a 401k is dependent on your timeframe.  Are you a tech programmer making 250k per year planning to invest 200k over ten years and retire at 35 with $2million in the bank?  If so, a retirement account is not for you, since you can't pull from a retirement account until you reach a certain age.  

For most investors with an average income, I recommend the hybrid approach.  Build both a taxable account and a retirement account together.  Let your dividends compound so that by the time you enter your fifties or early sixties, you would be free to transition away from full time work if necessary (you don't know how your body will age) before the minimum withdrawal age.  You may still need to work part time, but it would allow you greater flexibility to pursue less physically demanding work should that be your current career path.  It also allows you to call it quits early if you end up having incredible luck in the market and wish to cash out of the workforce.",3,1608779733,"[['O', 1]]",O,60.290000915527344,62.20000076293945
