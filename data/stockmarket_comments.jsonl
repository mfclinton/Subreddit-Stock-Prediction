{"submission_name": "t3_234vle", "id": "cgtkg6a", "text": "So... the way you've got it phrased is a little confusing.  Let me rephrase it and see if I've got this understood:\n\nYesterday, you bought 5 May 7-Strike Puts on PLUG @ ~2.20, at the exact time that PLUG was trading at $7.60 a share.  Today, you sold those 5 contracts when PLUG was trading at $6.90.  \n\nAlright, my math is a little bit of an estimate, but let's break this down:\n\nThe current Delta of the May 7-Strikes on PLUG is -0.42.  Let's assume that that was about the same throughout all of yesterday.  This means that your leverage was roughly: 7.60 / 2.20 * 0.42 = 1.45.  Always compute your leverage before going in.  A leverage of 1.45 means that for every 1% drop in PLUG, your contracts gained roughly 1.45% in value.  So in other words, you weren't really leveraged all that much.  So, assuming you bought for ~2.20 a contract (because (1114 - 12)/5), your contracts would have risen about 14.7% in value based on the leverage and price change of PLUG.  A 14.7% rise would mean that the premium of those puts would have been about 2.52.  However, you held overnight, so there's a time decay.  Currently, the theta on those contracts is 0.02, so if you held overnight, you'd lose 0.02 of the premium on each contract, bringing you down roughly to 2.50 for the premium.  Now, since the bid-ask spread was 10 cents, you pay a nice big 0.10 penalty overall, bringing you to 2.40.  \n\nYou should have made ~8-9% ($90-$100) profit when all was said and done.  I am not accounting for IV-loss (vega and implied volatility change), so I'm not sure how much that ate into it.  Also, if you held from the very beginning of the day yesterday until very late into the day today, that time decay would have hit you for more than 0.02... closer to 0.03.  IV loss probably accounted for the rest of your loss.\n\nIf you want to avoid the hassle of situations like this where you get nickled and dimed by all of the options parameters, you should probably choose a much larger leverage and hold for the smallest amount of time possible (two days is okay, but the leverage was negligible, so your contract prices eroded away a bunch of your profits).  The other alternative is to hold until expiration, where the math becomes extremely simple.  ", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1397614087.0, "tickers": [["PLUG", 4], ["VEGA.CN", 1]]}

From your calculation it seems you paid $2.20?\n\n$1114 (total) - $12 (fees) = $1102 for 5 contracts.\n\n$1102 / 5 (contracts) / 100 (shares) = $2.204.\n\nThe price of the underlying stock is important, but so is the actual price of the contract.

You can wait as long as you want for the right pitch.\n\nFor me, I like some reassurance that the company won't disappear in the time frame that I want to invest, which is typically very far in the future.\n\nWe all know Elon Musk is tremendous businessman having an almost religious conviction in his product, but let's look at the market; his competition. We have several car manufacturers out there now, they are very well established with deep pockets and even deeper R&D capabilities. So what happens if/when they release the electric cars that will directly compete against Tesla?\n\nRight now, Tesla is still stuck in that stuffy luxury car niche; competing against Mercedes, Audi, BMW. In this short amount of time, the Tesla brand has become more and more popular, but their production is still lagging anything to be considered a legitimate threat to luxury auto makers. Their results from last quarter also fell short from reaching what analysts thought they would be on track to produce. This has a lot of people hesitant.\n\nTesla stock has priced in some extreme growth for the company; growth that has yet to materialize except in market valuation. In the end, what really determines the movement of this stock beyond its fifteen minutes of fame is how many cars they can roll off their production line, and how quickly they can add extra digits to their earnings report to expand production capability.\n\nHowever, the longer the auto industry takes to step up and provide a direct competitor to Tesla, the more Tesla manages to survive and the more likely that a midrange car is released, which could signal the tipping point that investment firms will finally step up and say it's time to expand production. \n\nRight now oil has dropped to crazy low prices, so it makes fresh investing money even more rare for Tesla. What I would be watching for is how Tesla, the business entity, responds to this monstrous lull in oil prices which might last a month or a decade. How does the Tesla brand, an exclusive producer of electric vehicles, survive when the alternative just became much cheaper and sexier to investors. \n\nIf the production numbers don't lie, and it stays on a pretty decent run despite the tsunami it is fighting against, then you are looking at a true anomaly in the market. A diamond in the rough with ridiculous brand advantage. \n\nBut if it doesn't work out that way, you just lost a lot of money waiting for the world to think like you, and you didn't even cushion yourself by buying the company when it was trading close to its book value. There is an intimidating gap between the reproducible worth of Tesla's physical assets and how much the market is valuing it at. The only thing that can sustain that gap is a verifiable crazy brand franchise value, which has yet to materialize for me. \n\nSo I would say wait a few more pitches, and swing when the right one comes by.

{"submission_name": "t3_2x2iui", "id": "cowowla", "text": "  In my view, investing right now would be heavily speculative due to the fact that in theory, the stock would decline further.  Below is a sample for a report that I did with regards to Tesla, feel free to critique if needed: \n\nBecause Tesla Motors has released their patents to the public, Tesla has now given the opportunity for other organizations to create their own Tesla-like vehicles.  This potential oversaturation – not seen in the automobile market since the early-20th century – will become possible will the development of new technologies. Tesla believes that the “true competition” lies not in other companies that create electric cars, but gasoline organizations that include Chrysler, Ford, and GM.  Tesla sees the releasing of their patents as the beginning of independent companies producing electric cars.  This is not only an erroneous statement, but, it is a dangerous one for the investor.  Big automotive companies have been unable to produce a successful electric car due to the initial patents that Tesla put up.  Now that the patents have ceased, companies with big bankroll, including America’s Big Three automobiles, would be able produce similar products at a competitive rate. Historically, the development of electric technology has been either suppressed, or used and sold at a higher volume from large automotive companies.  One example of such suppression involves the Great American Streetcar Scandal. During the 1940’s, led by GM, street car systems throughout America were bought, replaced by General Motor busses and roads that would be congested by GM vehicles.  Because of the money and influence that GM possessed during that era, GM was able to destroy the streetcar business without major reprieve, leading to profit for investors in GM.  \n\nEventually, the allure of electric cars – having once been prevented from entering the market by higher automotive companies – will be too much to bear for Chrysler, Ford, and GM.  Already, Ford has released the 2014 Ford Focus Electric, an automobile with 104.5 miles-per-gallon on electricity, with an MSRP of $35,170.  Hybrid cars, ones that possess more than two-forms of input, are becoming popular with the Toyota Prius.  It is possible that with the advent of open patents, the three big automotive companies will compete against each other for the electric car market.   In a worst-case scenario for Tesla, the opening of patents, followed by the response from big automotive companies, will actually prevent, not encourage, investors to invest into electric car ventures, thus allowing the Big Three to persevere and monopolize the electric car market.  At that point, a speculator who bought Tesla at $240 per share will not be happy in the worst-case scenario. \n\t\nLike other enterprising companies, the development of Tesla Motors has required capital investment. Unfortunately, this has not translated into profit for an investor.  In the periods ending in December 31 of the years 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively, Tesla lost a combined $725 million in net income; yet, despite years of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, Tesla has one of the highest share prices on the Nasdaq stock exchange.    Looking at the NCAVPS, Tesla’s stock is overpriced.  For the period ending in December 31, 2013, taking current assets ($1.27 billion) minus total liabilities ($1.75 billion) in order to find a total of -$480 million, that total is divided by shares outstanding (124.63 million) to show Tesla’s NCAVPS at -3.85 .  Flipping the negative number into a positive one, at $259.28 per share, based on the closing price of October 8, 2014, Tesla, according to the theories and principals escribed by Benjamin Graham, is over-valued sixty-sevenfold.  Realistically, the price of Tesla Motors would be profitable to the speculator in the long-term at $2.58 per share.  \n", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1424875498.0, "tickers": [["GM", 3]]}

But the why is not really important to make money in the markets, but \"when\" is critical. I don't believe the company's profits translate into anything. Proof exists in history from Enron to Lehman Brothers, some stock that went down looked even better than these both. Hence no one decided this, it's simply technical in nature.\n\n - MSFT simply indicated a technical bottom in 2013, after a long base from the bottom of 2009. The extended base just goes to show that even after a long time of selling, the stock could not be pushed down, hence indicating good demand for the stock. After the beginning of the rally in April 2013, MSFT entered what I call a euphoria phase in Dec 2013. Th euphoria/bubble/topping, what ever you want to call it, is simply the natural state of any security (read people buying the security) to want to rest or sell after a good period or continue with the good phase (buying). As you can see form the data, the decision was to continue. As per my experience, these phases can go on for a while but are dangerous to enter into at that time, if one hasn't entered the stock from around the bottom (around April 2013 in MSFT). But these zones are extremely profitable & a skilled trader/investor can profit massively from these.\n\n - What happened on 26th of Jan? The stock simply broke an important support prices of 44.3 & 42.79, not to mention with a large gap! The reason the stock is staying down is also in the follow up stock price action. The price action remained below 44.3 & failed to move above this, signalling strong selling, just like in a base, this is just the opposite of a topping roof. Hence the stock keeps loosing ground. The next support is at 40.29 just below the recent close. Simply put buyers simply thought that they had held the stock long enough & the profit should be booked on this particular stock.\n\n - Not to say that a stock does not break a base or a roof, nothing is written in stone in the markets, but that would require a very large strong move & with the right system you would be indicated a buy at the break of an important resistance. BTW the important resistance at this point is 46.55. If the stock breaks through 44.3 & 46.55 & stays above both these price points, then it would be a stock to buy into, else... not really. The next supports to look at would be 37.8 & 31.6. Every buy or sell has it's own risks & rewards on offer... but there is no buy on MSFT as of now (IMHO). Analyzing this would require you to build a system that looks into the cash market stocks & provides you with entry, exit points, stop loss prices, contingency prices & plans & definitely a projection into the immediate future.\n\nJust in-case that sounded like something anyone can claim to know after the charts have shown it all, do have a look at my Crude Oil post from Oct 2013 http://www.marketlok.com/opinion-by-ravi-chandra/crude-oil-nymex-at-important-support-looking-bearish.\nMSFT is looking something like Crude did in Oct 2013, but that said it does not mean that it's where it is headed, it simply means that it has formed a roof...maybe a temporary one or maybe something stronger. Only time & the stock price performance around supports & resistances will tell us the entire story.\n\nHope that helps! ", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1428168527.0, "tickers": [["MSFT", 3]]}

Actually, I appreciate the thought but to be honest this is not gonna be representative of my returns at all for a couple key reasons: \n\n* These lists are JUST ideas. This kinda tracking assumes that I am buying at the exact open and selling at the exact close which is not at all how I trade. 90% of these stocks will not materialize into anything worthwhile ... the key is to know day by day which ones out of the list (usually one or two) will actually be worth trading. For example the only one I actually took off my list was NES, which I bought at $4.00 and sold at $4.15. I also sold NYMX flat which was a buy from yesterday. I missed ALSK but it cracked like 15% intraday which means if I had actually caught it I probably would have made 10-12% on it and this analysis would only show 3.83%. Lastly I didn't even touch SVU, WUBA, LODE, MCHX, RMBS, or IPCI. So you can see this isn't really representative of what I did at all.\n\n* There will also be other stocks that are not on the list that show up mid day and sometimes make huge gains unexpectedly (and possibly losses). For example I took a nice entry on CNTF at $1.14 today which wasn't even on my list today and am holding it overnight, and took a small loss on GBSN which wasn't on my list.\n\n* Lastly stocks I buy/hold for multiple days you would have to actually add up the gains/losses each day in order to figure it out. Swing trades are often much bigger than my day trades and make up a good chunk of my monthly gains. \n\nAnyway, it's a cool idea, but just take it with a grain of salt I guess. What would be really funny is if somehow this proved that if I just bought everything on my list in the morning and sold it at the end of the day I could still be profitable. I highly doubt that's the case but if you track this for 6 months and it proves that to be the case I will happily wake up every day, buy a bunch of shit and then go back to bed lol\n\nChris\n", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1430356882.0, "tickers": [["NYMX", 1], ["ALSK", 1]]}

I bought VLKAF @ $119.37 / share with a target price of between $143.32 and $182.49 by the end of FY16'. \n\nMy process began where you did: I think that the investment community is shocked and horrified that a company as large as Volkswagen could knowingly lie to it's investors for so long (go back and read some of the annual reports, specifically the sections on emissions, they're pretty damning in hindsight).\n\nHowever, pissing off Mutual Fund managers and hedge fund types who collectively feel they control the world, and not being able to make and sell passenger vehicles are two different things. VW still makes great cars. Moreover, I frankly just don't think that very many consumers give a shit about what levels of emissions their cars put out, as long as they're safe, fun to drive, and get good fuel economy. \n\nI think the place that this crisis will affect VW is in it's future expected revenue, and on it's balance sheet. I don't think this will affect profit margins, once you strip the incoming hits to the balance sheet out of the numbers.\n\nStarting with the balance sheet, pick a big number that may account for the fines, and the lawsuits. They've set aside something like $8Bil right now. I don't see the EPA fining VW into oblivion because even though they blatantly lied and cheated, this snafu didn't have the same environmental apocalypse-type effect that the BP spill did, for example. Here's my opinion on this: as long as VW's balance sheet can handle this kind of an event (it can), than this short-term hit to it's cash isn't actually that important to it's ability to turn out revenues year after year.\n\nAs for their revenues, I did some math (I assumed that VW doesn't sell another diesel car in the US until 2017, that they sell 12-25% fewer passenger vehicles in North America as a result of their brand taking a beating, and that they sell 5-10% fewer passenger vehicles worldwide as well). I expect them to lose between $12Bil and $24Bil in 2016 because of this mess. I had their expected 2016 revenues at $215Bil, so that puts my estimation for 2016 revenue at  between $194Bil and $206Bil, roughly.\n\nI used a crude way of turning those revenue numbers into projected value, I used Price to Sales ratio. Average PS Ratio for VW has been .42, it's PS ratio the week before this news broke was .35. Right now it's at .23, a reflection of the vitriol that large investors have for VW right now. I expect that ratio to recover over time as this news slips into the past and more Quarterly announcements come and go. \n\nI took my long position at the end of last week, but I do expect the price to go down quite a bit more before it goes back up.

Perhaps someone who really knows this can explain it better and correct me!\n\nConsider that EMC owns 80% of VMware and only 20% is publicly traded. So some significant proportion of the 53 B valuation for EMC is due to ownership of VMware. That means today when you buy EMC stock what you're actually getting is a bit muddied because the part of the valuation that's made of VMware ownership is independent of EMC performance alone. It's just something that's roughly tracking VMware performance.\n\nDell and EMC have agreed that 67B is a fair price to pay. That price includes VMware stock of which Dell will retain only 28%. So they don't have to pay the full price. For the remaining 52% of VMware ownership they will issue a tracking stock that will start around $9 and will track VMW at its price from last Wednesday October 7.\n\nI don't know how the tracking stock will work exactly. For example if everyone decides to sell their tracking stock where is the money coming from? If it results in the actual sale of VMW stock to raise the cash that creates sell pressure which should bring the price down unless there are enough buyers. Whatever the details roughly it probably means 52% more of VMW stock is released into the market and no one knows where the price will settle. It's a sweet deal for EMC owners and a bit of an iffy situation for VMW stock owners I believe since Dell is really after EMC and in the process clearing up a messy situation (where VMware was mixed with EMC) at the expense of creating uncertainty for the VMware stock.\n\nAgain I'm not expert.

Intel's business, like AMD, is a high spend business and very susceptible to chip demand which is not predictable at all. I don't recommend investing in either to them to quite frank. I do like the new 3DX point chip out of Intel though, it has super potential, but I recommend buying micron(MU) to take advantage of that one if you like it. \n\nBut I also like Starbucks, its been a darling of wall street for a while and its probably here to stay.

I haven't looked in depth at any of these stocks before hand so everything I am going to say is just after some quick glances at news articles and stock trends.\n\nFSLR - So my first question is to why this stock has gone down nearly $40 since march.  I took a look at the quarterly reports and it appears the net sales decreased from September last year until June this year.  Then although they raised, the gross profit % went down the second quarter this year.  So...not looking good.  On top of that, the P/E for the stock has decreased heavily from 14 this time last year to nearly 5.  All in all, there isn't much information that I can extrapolate from to tell you if the stock is over or under valued and the earnings per share has gone down a lot.  I would sell on the principle that you're not seeing it as much as an investment as a gamble. If you're gambling that's fine, but since there is a lack of information and it doesn't seem to be doing well, I would try and place your money in something that is more guaranteed.\n\nCCL - I can't tell if you meant carnival or royal Caribbean here because you put RCL and said carnival, maybe it's both?

There is a caveat to this which is higher frequencies also (in general) allow for faster data transfer. In addition, what companies can do is instead of setting up one tower for 25mi^2 of coverage and 10,000 devices at a time, they can instead set up smaller towers which have 5mi^2 of coverage (with less propagation distance) each with 10,000 devices of capacity, for a total of 50,000 devices spread over 25mi^2. (And to be honest, I'm pulling the numbers out of my ass, but the concept is the same)\n\nThird, concerning technology. New technologies for telecom in general comes from companies like Broadcom, which specialize in making the chips for wireless telecommunication. When new technologies come out and standards are created, phone makers purchase the technologies from Broadcom and put them into their phone while Verizon upgrades its infrastructure.

Here is my DD with respect to why I do not believe it will be successful\n\nFirst, we can see the analysts having mostly on hold, some on buy and some on outperform. What is interesting though is that the price of the stock is currently above the target price for the analysts, reaching into the outperform category.\n\nSecond, we can look at previous quarter to this quarter performance. The previous quarter has allowed the stock price to drop as low as 21% after its earnings where they actually reported positive gain in EPS and revenue plus a steady outlook. What triggered this drop was from analysts downgrading the stock after. However, from the previous quarter to this quarter, the stock have seen to be reaching a historical highs with a 29% increase in its price, going above the price off the previous quarter prior to earnings by 5%.\n\nNow, adding up what is happening to this stock, it is showing magnificent growth but there are many reasons to believe that it is due to momentum and not much fundementals supporting it.\n\nWe can start by looking at the market cap of this company which is $18Billion. Its competitors are SAP (108B), ULTI (6B), ADP (47B), ORCL (175B), CRM (56.5B). Comparing Workday to these companies, which are veterans in the HRM fields and have more than just HRM and EPM services, the price of workday is wayyy too high. This is considered when we look at the market for online HRM and EPM services combined is approximately 20B to 40B (according to forbes and app research). This is with workday with only approximately 5 to 10% off the market share for these markets.\n\nIf we account the evaluations in, a company like Workday cannot and should not be valued at 18 billion market cap even accounting in growth potential. There is just isn't a market that is big enough to contain its price even if it is a market leader let alone only having a small slice of the market currently.\n\nWhat I believe is that the price right now is just due to momentum of people buying it from its recent good news. Workday did just sign with Walmart to work with them and provide HR software to them along with many other companies through this quarter. This is one risk that the amount of signings they have might actually \"justify\" their value for this quarter and bring the stock price higher after earnings today by reporting a good quarter and a good guidance.\n\nHowever and overall, I do not believe that they should be valued at this price and today will be the catalyst to bring them down another 10%.\n\n", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1488219700.0, "tickers": [["EPM", 2], ["WDAY", 1], ["SAP", 1], ["ADP", 1], ["ORCL", 1], ["CRM", 1], ["HR", 1], ["FLSS", 1]]}

I believe this is an overreaction.  Even so, if you're thinking of initiating or adding to a stake, I suggest waiting until the stock shows some evidence of stabilization in the $25-$27 range.\n\nThe retailing industry is going through wrenching changes. I'm not terribly optimistic about malls anchored by big-box department stores like Macy's or J.C. Penney. However, outlet centers, with their discount prices, will likely survive the current shakeout–and thrive over the long run. Tanger Factory Outlets (NYSE: SKT), one of the savviest operators in the space, continues to put up superb numbers. Occupancy as of December 31 stood at 97.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year despite the turbulence in retail. Dividends have been sweetened every year since the company's 1993 IPO. In the past decade alone, SKT has nearly doubled its payout. Small wonder SKT has produced 60% more wealth than the S&P 500 index over the past 10 years (through December 31, 2016), and more than twice as much as the average REIT.\n\nHowever, a wave of emotional selling engulfed SKT following its first quarter earnings release.  If you own SKT or are contemplating a purchase of the stock, I encourage you to study the company's latest earnings presentation [(here)](https://www.snl.com/Cache/1500098863.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=1500098863&iid=103061) and, perhaps even more important, this [transcript](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-skt-earnings-conference-010100227.html) of the Q1 conference call. From these documents, you'll see that, yes, the recent turmoil in retailing has temporarily slowed SKT's growth. However, the company is doing all the right things to bounce back: freshening up its existing portfolio and filling vacancies with stronger tenants; adapting to changing consumer habits by introducing more food and home-furnishings options in its centers; maintaining a healthy, investment-grade balance sheet; and remaining disciplined with new development.\n\nOn this last point, SKT truly stands out. The company won't break ground on a new outlet center unless 60% of the space is pre-leased. Unlike our president in his Atlantic City days, Steve Tanger is no speculative wheeler-dealer! A Dividend Aristocrat, SKT has hiked its payout every year since 1993.  I've been steadily accumulating the shares in my retirement account. \n", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1495302221.0, "tickers": [["SKT", 6]]}

The system is fully rigged against the retail trader. We have the least amount of information and are at the bottom of the market food chain. That is why day traders fail. They have no information but are basing a 30 second hold on nothing but a candlestick and volume action? It doesn't work for 99% of people who try it. 90% of new traders lose 90% of their account in 90 days, so the saying goes. The other 10% did their due diligence and eased into it. \n\nGet your hands on some solid market strategy books. Find one that suits your risk profile and stick with it. I've found success with CAN SLIM. I have a mix of long term holds and swing trades to take advantage of momentum.

{"submission_name": "t3_6nybos", "id": "dkf4o37", "text": "Look up the Creation/Redemption mechanism of ETF's. This is how shares outstanding of the ETFare increased/reduced.\n\nFollowing the QQQ example, price of the ETF is determined as so:\n\n1.  Gather a basket of securities that represents the index being replicated. Weight/assemble in the same percentages so that you get the same exposure. In other words, make your basket have 11.58% AAPL for example.\n2.  Let's assume you have assembled your basket at exactly the correct weights, or close enough, that the AP's (Authorized Participant) are willing to accept (and in turn, the issuer is willing to accept). You now deliver to them your basket that has a notional value equivalent to 50,000 shares of the ETF you'd like to exchange for. 50,000 shares is the standard creation size for ETF's. So let's say your basket is worth $7,000,000. you will receive 50,000 shares of QQQ (assuming the price of QQQ is 140).\n3.  The price of the ETF itself is then kept inline with the index by the arbitrage mechanism. If an AP notices that the basket can be assmbled for less than 140, they will assemble more baskets and have the issuer exchange them for shares of the ETF. Buying up those shares will put upward pressure on the basket's constituents. The reverse is also possible, if the ETF is trading at a discount to iNAV (indicative NAV, basically real time calculation of NAV) the APs will take shares of QQQ and exchange them for the underlying basket, depressing the price of QQQ.\n\nThis of course affects how you experience ETF price changes, AAPL is 11% of QQQ, while this is huge component, there's still 89% of other securities that can change the value of QQQ. Think of it in extremes, even if AAPL goes up by 100%, if the remaining 89% drops by 50%, you're still looking at 33.5% drop. AAPL can't make up for -50% if it's weight is only 11%.\n\nSometimes what AP's do if they don't immediately have shares enough to form a creation/redemption unit, they can accumulate the position little by little and calculate how much needs to hedged based on the current composition of the basket's correlation to the ETF itself. Since the components of QQQ are pretty damn liquid, it's easy to keep tracking error to a minimum.\n\nThis is why with less liquid/more niche products such as frontier market ETF like EMFM, there's a bigger tracking error between the ETF and the index - it's harder to acquire the underlying components. Sometimes you're forced to deliver a partial basket with a larger cash component and the issuer/AP will charge a higher risk premium to do the trade.\n\nStuff may have changed in the past 2 or so years, but this is how we used to execute big trades in small products (think average daily volume of 30,000, and we're trading several million shares). Creation/Redemption becomes extremely important. With larger products like SPY and QQQ, we could just VWAP the trade or sometimes even just do a large block trade if the AP/MM gave a good price.\n", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1500454855.0, "tickers": [["AAPL", 4], ["AP", 1]]}

Here's what I think you're missing.\n\nFirst, all these companies are huge. Many people (myself included) think that the greatest opportunity for growth is in smaller companies. I think you should have a significant portion in small caps (one quarter?A one third? one half? I don't know -- it depends on your age, risk tolerance, objectives). If you're looking for ideas, there are a ton of them, but here are some I think have modest valuations and great growth potential: PRAA, SWIR, CLNE, WCC, EDIT.\n\nSecond, several of the companies you mention I think are good companies with great histories, but their glory days are mostly past. When the market values a company like it's going to continue growing as it has in the past, I am quite skeptical that some of these companies can repeat their past and double/redouble in the future. (MSFT, AAPL, V).\n\nYou have one foreign company (BABA) that I like, but it is huge. What about foreign companies that aren't so huge. (MELI?)\n\nFinally, let me just suggest that the best investors don't follow the herd. Look for stocks that are being overlooked. You're not doing that with the list you provided.\n\nI am a strong believer that the best way to get wealthy is by investing in individual stocks and avoiding mutual funds, financial advisors, and most of the financial services industry.

If you guys didn't make at least 20% over the last year from your investments, he needs to take a good look in the mirror and say to himself, *maybe I'm overestimating my capabilities*.

I’m more concerned with learning what it means when the stock market is closed.\n\nThat means the bid (current highest price someone is willing to buy at, and literally speaking, a pool of buy limit orders at that price) is $6.48. There are 3400 shares (34 lots of 100) in that pool of orders. Could be one order or many, and there's no way to tell since the order book is aggregated, but 99% chance it's many orders, since the market is big :-)\n\nOther side says the same, but for sell orders. Currently there are 6000 shares for sale at a limit of $6.52. \n\nIn this case thus there is a 4 cent ($6.52-6.48) spread and a 2600 share sell imbalance (6000-3400)\n\n>\n>At times, the bid number in the (brackets) next to the bid price is MUCH larger than the number inside the ask brackets next to the ask price - and vice versa. What does this indicate and does it provide any useful information?\n\nIn after hours it doesn't mean as much because there aren't very many market centers/exchanges open, so there are bound to be big spreads and large imbalances just due to whatever was left on the books when the market closed. During the day however, if you see persistent imbalances it can mean many things and is absolutely significant. You might think a big bid outweighing a big ask is a bullish sign, but in reality smart money doesn't often show their big trades on the book. More likely, if you see a big block of stock being bid it is because someone is trying to create the illusion of a big buyer, in order to prop the stock up so they can sell. Similarly, a big offer can be a bullish sign since it can indicate a large buyer trying to hold the stock down by creating the illusion of a large sell wall. This isn't always the case but without level 2 access and watching the tape (time and sales) in real time it's very difficult to tell since these bids and asks are mostly put there by high frequency trading algorithms that can change them in literal nanoseconds. To determine what's really going on you need to watch the tape and level 2 order book in real time with professional trading software (DAS is my preferred software for this), and do a lot of reading in order to understand how to \"read the tape\" (there's a term to Google for further research). \n\nThat should help!\n", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1517394379.0, "tickers": [["TD", 1]]}

All of these arguments are persuasive.\n\nNo they're not. Let's discuss scale in services revenue. Netflix's total revenue for all of 2017 was a little over $11 billion. Apple's Services revenue was $8.4 just in the last quarter. Netflix has around 120 million paying subscribers. Across its services Apple has a total of 240 million subscribers. I think it's safe to say that a huge percentage of Netflix subscribers are *already* Apple subscribers. Apple's gain in customers would be only incremental. Last quarter's iPhone revenue was over $61 billion. Adding ~$3 billion in Netflix revenue wouldn't have made Apple any less \"dependent\" on the iPhone. Apple's Chinese revenue was just shy of $18 billion for the quarter; mercurial or not, that's just a vastly larger scale than Netflix. \n\nBuying Netflix would cost around $100 billion, but that price is based on the value of the business as a whole, which is primarily from the relationship with customers. Finding people willing to give you money every month is hard, and worth a lot of money to some people. But Apple (along with the other potential suitors named such as Google and Amazon) already has a large scale and direct billing relationship with customers; they don't need to buy it so they couldn't possibly get their money's worth from such a transaction. \n\n> Apple has the resources to dramatically expand the variety of Netflix's content offering\n\nApple has the resources to expand their *own* content offering, without spending anything extra on buying relationships with their own customers. Think of how much \"must see\" content Apple could buy for *one hundred billion dollars*. \n\n> Turning Hastings loose inside Apple, potentially as the next CEO, would be a lollapalooza for consumers and shareholders alike. \n\nThis is just ridiculous. Hastings has no experience in hardware, nor in anything remotely the size and scale of Apple. It's a big company and being CEO is a big job. He wouldn't even be an SVP if Apple bought Netflix.

I would probably buy a fund which tracks market indexes (for example, Schwab's SWPPX or SCHD, but there are many) or a high yield bond fund (a few of the better ones are PRHYX [only available through a Schwab account unless you hit the lottery], PONDX, LHYAX). Stay away from \"sector\" funds - it's safer than an individual stock but not sufficiently diversified. *Edit: Look for \"no load\" [transaction fee] funds with lower \"net expense ratio\"s (which my suggestions all are) - other funds will take too much of your money in fees. Again, I recommend considering a Schwab account because they have a huge list of funds they offer \"no load\" - many of which DO have a transaction fee if bought elsewhere.*\n\nFinally, though, this investment broker is right.

This will lead to massive inequality as the capitalist eliminate the other half of the equation (capital + labor = goods). This could mean massive booms for the stock market in the beginning as companies start having insane profit margins. Eventually the lack of well paying jobs will take its toll and the following bust will most likely competly undermine the economy and stock market with it. A new economic system that take into account free labor will have to be rebuilt.\n\nThe governments react properly. Most intleegent people have been watching automation or a while and have come up with some good solutions to this changing economic equation. This could be a government program that incentives business to automate but then heavily taxes them after. This program would be managed to have a slow but steady transition  away from labor. Their eliminated workers will go onto a basic standard income or some program paid for by the addition tax on fully automated companies. With this they also have education classes to help people become acustom to the new life and realize their full potential (I personally dont think just giving everyone bsi would work without some mental health improvements for most people. Living as labor in a capitalist society will be vastly different then being an artist in a automatic society.) For the stock market I see this going one of two ways either as the companies become automated they give up private ownership (have a max % of shares owned by one person) or they get rid of the stock market entirely put all the automated companies into one owners hands and just tax the hell out of any capital gains. \n\n\nThe third option is Governments react poorly.

{"submission_name": "t3_883bds", "id": "dwhun6r", "text": "Personally, I would not invest in the company at the moment, for a couple of reasons. I love the company and their service, but sadly that's not enough.\n\nFirstly, Spotify is not making a profit. That might be true for other companies as well, companies like Netflix and Amazon, but the difference is that those companies choose to not be profitable in order to grow big enough and get enough traction to shut competitors out of the market. Spotify simply isn't profitable. They may get profitable at some point, but I just don't see it near term.\n\nSecondly, Spotify doesn't have a moat. Spotify may be the biggest and the best in music streaming, but that's mainly due to them entering the market first. While they are still growing rapidly, they are losing market shares even more rapidly. And Spotify is a one trick pony. The stream music, that's it, meaning that their music streaming business HAS to become profitable at one point or another. Their main competitors on the other hand are backed by Apple and Amazon respectively. They are money machines that can run their respective music streaming services at a loss and prioritize growth over profitability for decades if need be.\n\nThe lack of a moat means that Spotify doesn't have the same pricing power as Netflix for example. Netflix could ramp up their prices by 25% tomorrow and keep growing, because they have no serious competition and some of their content is only available through them. If Spotify did the same thing, many of their customers would probably leave for a competitor.\n\nThirdly, I'm not sure that Spotify, or at least the Dynamic Duo in charge of it, are cut out for operating in a publicly traded environment. Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon are notorious for keeping their cards close to their chest, and they're extremely unpopular among Swedish journalists due to the company being lacking in transparency. Just six months ago, Daniel Ek denied in an interview that they had any plans of going public. But a listing process is not a simple matter, at that point Spotify had probably been preparing their listing for at least six months. Personally, I believe that Spotify's first years on the NYSE will be filled with minor scandals about Spotify breaking with customs and using loopholes to avoid sharing information that is customary to share with the market.\n\nI think that the only things that could get me to change my Outlook on Spotify is 1) if they somehow became able to harness network effects, or 2) became able to successfully launch their own music. It is a problem for Spotify that being big doesn't give them much of an edge toward Apple and Amazon. They have tried to establish network effects through their partnership with Facebook, but it probably hasn't worked out as they'd hoped. And if they were able to produce music of their own that people really liked, they could get a Netflix situation going for them, whereas everything they've produced up until now has gone pretty much unnoticed.", "score": 18, "created_utc": 1522356546.0, "tickers": []}

The truth is, iPhone has never really been the most innovative or feature packed phone. People have their own reasons for buying it, but nothing that has happened in the past 2 years from a functionality standpoint have negatively impacted most of those reasons. iPhone sells because of marketing, and marketing functions because of cash, and AAPL has enough cash.\n\nThis is the core business - cost leadership through cheaper manufacturing costs. Leveraging the volume of iPhone sales to manufacturers allows the iPhone business to keep sourcing costs very low, and margins very high. iPhone has, since its inception, had the highest profit margin per device than any other mobile device on the market.\n\nHowever, the iPhone business is plateauing - most people who want an iPhone have an iPhone.  Sell a great phone this year, you take away from next year’s sales. The opportunity cost in the next 10 years of selling an incremental amount of iPhones for x ROI is greater, because emerging technologies force Apple to expand the business via supporting rods through their existing products. Apple made similar decisions in the past few years with some results better than others - Watch is growing along with its margins, but TV’s value exists mostly in tandem with other products. CarPlay is doing ok, but has a really long payback period - the car business simply can’t sustain Apple’s preferred margin level. \n\nOver the next 5-10 years Apple will have to prove to investors that it can win at emerging technologies in the same way as iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\nIn other words, no single stock is safe.

Think or Swim (TOS) has a very good paper account, there are others you can look at as well.  \n\nEven if you trade on RH because of the lack of commissions, that app does not have the analysis capabilities that a platform like TOS has.  So you can do your research on TOS and then move to RH.  However it wouldn't surprise me if you end up doing all your trading on TOS eventually.  \n\n- Next, develop a trading plan where you spell out your stock selection process, when to open a trade, when to close it, and what you will do if the trade goes against you.  Few people make a consistent profit without some form of trading plan that calls the above out.\n\n- Lastly, when you do start trading with real money think about solid blue chip dividend paying stocks that are rated as bullish.  \n\nNKE is rated as bullish, but the dividend is only 1.13% this morning.  \n\nDIS is also rated bullish and pays a 1.69% dividend.

Buy low, sell high.\n* Facebook seems poised for success and growth in the medium term. Instagram is at all time highs of relevance and will continue to be. The main platform while stagnant allows for such hyper targeted advertising that it would be dumb for folks to not leverage this. Instagram advertising also leverages this data.\n* I happen to work at a competitor (im sure you can guess) and I can see that Facebook has penetrated the mobile programmatic advertising space big time and it is only continuing. They are just getting into the normalization phase and my bet is they have many a big client to keep signing. Their revenue growth will likely come very naturally... Sales people don't have to do much quite frankly.\n* The larger trend at play here. Google and Facebook (and Amazon to extent) are benefitting from literally the biggest revolution since oil. The reason why these companies keep growing their revenues is largely due to the fact that more people are getting internet access via cheap smart phones and cheap wireless. Each time a new person gets the internet Facebook will get growth because who the hell gets a phone and doesn't use Instagram/Whatsapp/Facebook, it is just so core to the experience of having a phone and it is free.

Investing in companies that provide good dividend growth over time have consistently outperformed the SP500 over long time frames. In this way you turbo charge your compound interest through higher dividend yields on your initial price, and through the appreciation of the stock price itself. Think about it this way, you are buying more shares with the dividends from your previous shares. The new shares also pay dividends which can purchase even more shares. This cycle continues, resulting in a rising passive income that only grows faster the longer you participate in this strategy.

So ending at 49.88 or whatever is not a good sign that you're going to break out. Additionally, lower resistance has a positive slope. This is very important. if your lower resistance has a positive slope, then you're going to see a break out when the lines cross. But if you draw a line of where this intersection occurs, it's like a month out from now or something. So if I know I have about a month until break out, and I'm already at 49.88, then it makes more sense we drop to the slope line, which was between 46-47. And what do you know, that's exactly where it went to.\n\nNow that said, I was a bit too squeamish to go on puts for intel, so I did SOXS calls. This is a good alternative. SOXS is a bear market bet, so it will probably rise a bit tomorrow as AMD, WD, INTC etc all get dragged down.\n\n", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1548370819.0, "tickers": [["INTC", 3]]}

{"submission_name": "t3_azq7az", "id": "ei9pyai", "text": "So it seems the key thing you weren't aware of was the halt risk. Read up on the Nasdaq halt rules. They're well known and the key thing to watch for on BPTH was when it started skipping up dollars at a time on air (very very low volume with a huge spread). Generally with trades like this you don't just want insane upside moves that cause a halt every time the stock reopens. You want something liquid that is trending all day. On the first day, even though the stock only went from like 7 to 14 it traded almost 100 million shares so holding even 2000-3000 shares throughout the day would have made you just as much if not more money and there was very little halt risk.\n\nIf you watched BPTH from the early morning on the 2nd day, you would have seen it only took four minutes for it to halt the first time. That's a prime warning that you want to be VERY VERY CAREFUL and if you don't know the halt rules you should stay away completely. The first reason for this is you won't know when it's going to halt again. The 2nd and more important reason is that the halts it did have on the 2nd day were mostly LUDP circuit breaker halts (meaning the stock went up or down too fast in a certain timeframe), but if there are too many of those the exchange can and will issue a T12 halt, which means they are requesting additional info from the company on the trading activity, which could mean it could be halted for months. \n\nThe reason it dropped so hard after the initial downside halt after it peaked at 73 is that the new halt rules now say that if the stock is halted while falling, it will remain halted until it can open with less than a small percentage drop (I don't remember the exact percentage) from the last time it *would have been halted*. The problem with this is that if the stock is at 73, gets halted and Nasdaq determines that if it reopened it would not have enough bids to stay above, say, 65, it will delay the reopening and the reference price resets to 65. This is almost certainly what happened when it halted at 73, reopened at 60 and then halted again. After people saw the big drop and rehalt into 60, they all pulled their bids, and from 60 down to 35 or whatever ridiculous drop occurred after that, there was never any potential for it to open higher so Nasdaq just left it halted. The result, obviously, is the halt at 60 and then reopen 50% lower with no chance to escape. \n\nAnyway, read up on this stuff. You still have 35k...that's plenty of money to keep trading. Just live and learn and definitely stay away from psycho stuff like BPTH when it gets that wild especially if you don't know the rules. Also, learn a little something about float rotation and short squeezes. There was absolutely no fundamental reason for the stock to run like this. Yes it had news, but the reason it ran so hard that 2nd day was due to trapped short sellers and failures to deliver that resulted in forced buyins by brokers who had clients trapped on the short side.", "score": 32, "created_utc": 1552303886.0, "tickers": [["BPTH", 3], ["VERY", 2]]}

Stocks are probably the worst instrument to day trade thanks to the BS rules like halts due to which you got screwed.

If you are not stubborn on trying to trade direction, options is also a good instrument but involves a lot of education.\n2. Read about Kelly Criterion and Risk of Ruin. Even if you have a positive expectancy strategy of say 99% chance of winning, if you are betting it all in 1 go (or in this case 1 stock), that 1 in 100 times that the stock gets halted and loses 50%+, you will lose a huge chunk of your equity, which no one wants.\n3. When you are day trading, you are competing with HFTs and algos. Most of the legendary scalpers like Paul Rotter quit for a reason. There's a reason why the richest people are almost never day traders. Although I know quite a few day trading educators who are filthy rich but as you can guess they didn't make the majority of their net worth day trading.

I wonder which price they'd need to advertise for this.  The price for the drug itself is over $5000 (for a month's supply).  I don't know the exact price, because I've never paid it.  My insurance covered most of the cost, but I think I had to pay somewhere between $100-$200/month.  But Humira also has a copay card that _I_ _think_ most people that have insurance qualify for, which left me paying $5/month.\n\nI don't take Humira anymore, I now take Enbrel, sold by Amgen.  Similar drug, similar price.  I pay $10/month with their copay card.\n\nSo again, I wonder which price they'd list.  I'm imagining they'd market the price with their copay card, with maybe some fine print showing the full price.\n\nEdit: Also, since lots of people think it's wrong for these companies to advertise at all, I'll give the perspective of someone who's needed to take one of these medications that heavily marketed. Many of the drug commercials I've seen are used for people with autoimmune diseases like Crohn's, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriasis, etc.  For people with these conditions that take these medications, their treatment is ongoing - there's no drug that can cure it, so they might need to treat it with medication indefinitely.  When you need to manage a disease indefinitely, it can be beneficial to know what your options are in terms of medications.  You might think this should be left to the doctor, but there's no harm in a person knowing they have options - a doctor isn't going to prescribe these medications to a patient that doesn't need them, and medications do sometimes stop working (which is why I switched).\n\nAlso, some people may have stopped taking Humira because the injections were painful.

This would require:\n\n- Insane productivity.\n\n- Implausible access to pricing and news data resources (which are often not freely available).\n\n- Expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, finance, and data science. OP had to implement financial, time-series and linguistic feature engineering pipelines, as well infer the architecture and hyper-parameters used in all papers AND train all these models. ALL WITHIN 7 MONTHS. All while previously being a trader professionally i.e. not likely an expert in many of these fields.\n\n- OP also claims he \"web scraped\" all the data which is highly unlikely as price datasets are often sold for a pretty penny and not publicly available in the detail described in several of these papers.\n\n- Down the thread, OP says he does not know what a \"meta analysis\" study is al the while being capable of implementing 130+ papers. So someone who is an expert in ML, statistics, data science and finance does not know one of the most basic types of scientific study. All the while essentially engaging in a meta analysis study.\n\n- OP describes himself as \"a trader at a Tier 1 US bank\" to lend credibility to his post: in itself that description is ridiculous and sounds like a naive attempt at instilling authority.\n\n- When others encourage OP to publish results, he answers evasively: \"probably a bit deep for a public forum but I was kinda glad to see the back of that work. It was an awesome learning experience but it's pretty soul destroying experimenting with tonnes of stuff that just doesn't work.\"\n\nEVIDENCE PROVIDED: Non-existent.\n\nAll OP has to show for all this work is a hastily written Reddit post with dubious claims. There is no proof of the work done whatsoever, no code samples, not even result tables or graphs. The discussion of basic results are often made criticisms of this line of research.\n\nMOTIVATION:\n\nAt the end OP shills his cryptotrading bot. This post was likely all just purely made-up to market his cryptotrading bot service. OP uses some common criticisms of market prediction research to garner authority as a wizz-kid to attract people to his crypto scam.\n\nWhat's worse many on HN and Reddit seem to gobble it up naively.

You can have margin approval with $1 on your account, you just any buy on margin (google 'minimum margin buying requirements'). TDA will generally not allow you to go into reg t (for your own good), and most major self directed brokerages do this. Remember, settlement for stock is 3 total business days (trade+2).

{"submission_name": "t3_eidovx", "id": "fcp90k5", "text": "I usually respond same thing to everyone asking for tips and advice for investing. So this post may be the same post some user might have already read. Anyway....\n\nBefore you start investing this and that, there's something else you need to learn that is more important than investing, and that's yourself. You need to learn to control your emotion. What I mean by that is when the stock price fall, you can't panic, fear, and just sell your shares. You can't let your emotion of fear dedicate your decision. Also, you need to be patience. If you are hasty you can miss out on important information that may impact your portfolio. You need to able to have faith in your investment even though they may be in negative. But most importantly you need to study and research your investment thoroughly. What's going around the world that can impact your investment (for better or worse)? What can happen in the world that can impact your investment (for better or worse)? If you have done your study and research, and you purchased your investment, then you should be confident in your investments even when the stock is not doing well.\n\nSecond: stock market will crash eventually. It will happen, over and over. But, they will always recover, and they will break new record every. Single. Time. Yes, not every single company is gonna make it, but majority of the companies will. This is why you need to understand what you're investing. For example when market crash happen, Microsoft will crash. Disney will crash. Apple will crash. Amazon will crash. But they will recover because of what these companies represent, and their foothold in the world. Like I said over and over, you have to study and research the company in your investment. That's why I personally believe studying and researching the investment is the most important job because you're trying to build strong portfolio that can withstand the crash, and thrive afterward to break new records. And don't be persuade by what the social media, news, or people around you are saying. They can't predict the future, but you can research and see what is going around the world that can impact your portfolio.\n\nThird: time in the market will beat timing the market for most investors.\n\nFourth: if you don't feel comfortable investing with large amount of money, start with $100. Get your emotion use to the feeling of stock market going up and down. Also get experience in meanwhile. When you feel comfortable and confident, invest $200, $300, and so on until you feel completely good about investing in thousands of dollar.\n\nLast, and this may sound contradicting, know when to cut your loss. This comes from knowing what the company is going through. For example, if the company is going down from lawsuit, or legal issue, or whatever it is that will bankrupt the company, it's best to cut your loss and move on. Again, this is why you want to study and research your investment. Check if they have a records of lawsuit that they seem to unable to grow. See if there's law that's gonna change the fundamental of the company. Etc, etc, etc.\n\nIf you're interested, you can check out the playlist of a videos [\\[here\\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_JpNx7DVzBom-ZfxnN9C4faSEvBqmRI9) that cover basic introduction to online brokerage (which you need, and you want to pick the one that may benefit you the most based on what they offer in investment/retirement accounts), basic introduction to investment/retirement accounts (there are different accounts that you may not be qualify), and basic introduction to stock, ETF, Mutual Fund, and Bond.\n\nGood luck, and invest wisely.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1577854559.0, "tickers": []}

Still can’t find any FDA approvals.\n\nEdit: Here’s the full scoop per Yahoo Finance\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (NYSE American: ZOM)(“Zomedica” or “Company”), a veterinary diagnostic company, announced today that the Company has filed a U.S. patent application covering compositions and methods for five fecal parasite detection assays for detecting parasitic infections in cats and dogs designed for use with its ZM-020 pathogen detection device. The patent application details optimal fecal sample amounts for parasite infection detection. In early 2019 Zomedica previously submitted a U.S. provisional patent application covering compositions and methods for detecting urinary tract infections (UTIs) designed for use with its ZM-020 pathogen detection platform to detect urinary tract infections in dogs and cats. The initial library of pathogens for urine samples is focused on the identification of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas bacteria species and three types of crystals and white blood cells. The initial library of pathogens for fecal samples is focused on the identification of hookworms, roundworms, whipworms, coccidia and giardia.\n\nThe assays are intended to be used with the ZM-020 pathogen detection device which is a miniaturized Raman spectroscopy platform capable of broad-based pathogen identification in minutes. The technology used in the ZM-020 device, which is currently being developed by Seraph Biosciences, Inc. (“Seraph”) has the potential to achieve reference lab sensitivity/specificity in-clinic during the point-of-care experience, which could result in better pet outcomes and faster recovery. The ZM-020 diagnostic platform requires a small fecal sample preparation.  Additionally, the platform has automated analysis and does not require specialized staff training. Assuming development work is successfully completed Zomedica expects the commercial launch of the ZM-020 fecal test to occur by 2022 and urine tests by 2023. Zomedica is strategically committed to a singular commercial focus of its endocrine diagnostic platform, TRUFORMA™ through 2021.\n\n\nIt’s currently dipping, waiting so I can purchase some for long term.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1582298119.0, "tickers": []}

If you go looking for the market bottom even after a 20% plunge from all-time highs, you're still taking a big risk. It's safer wait for signs of stabilization or even recovery, even if that means missing out on some of the upswing.\n\nThis mostly applies if you're looking to invest a large chunk of your cash reserves at once.

We are at the very end of the longest bull market in history and there is ample evidence that economic activity is being heavily affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which could easily lead to a worldwide recession if it continues for more than a few more weeks. I would be very cautious about any claims that you can pick up \"all these discounted stocks\" at a bargain price right now. There are definitely some companies out there which will rebound nicely, but there's no guarantee a recovery will be fast or as broadly based as the last 10 years. There's no substitute for doing your research.\n\n>When the market crash and it begins to rise again, will it be a steady rise or a sharp drastic high increase on the overall market.\n\nNo one knows that. Depends entirely on what happens with the economy. It took five years for the DJIA to make new highs after the pre-financial crisis peaks in 2007. It could be shorter this time, or even longer.\n\n>What are your plans for investing into stocks while this coronavirus is going on?\n\nCurrently, looking for an opportunity for some profit taking on the stocks I've own for a long time, and maybe averaging into one or two stocks I have my eye on.\n\n>I have my eye on tesla, apple, Disney, MasterCard, visa, RCL, NCLH, MSFT, BAC, VTI, VOO.....

This is a strategy called dollar cost averaging if you want to look it up.\n\n3. Nobody knows.

The reason why you don't buy the dip is because once momentum shifts downward, you have no idea when it will bottom out. Most people buy the dip and ride their losses close to the ground.

If the firm determines that you meets its day trading criteria, regardless of the size of the account, you are required to maintain $25k in  assets at the beginning of each trading day.\n\n\\-I've never seen a financial firm of any kind switch the type of funds used to settle a trade (margin funds vs. cash). If you borrow money and use it to purchase something, you're using borrowed money.  You only affect the interest that you pay when you use cash to reduce the amount that you borrowed. \n\n\\-The handbook does seem to imply that the margin that you used to purchase assets is tracked to calculate the interest that you pay. So in that sense, the assets that you buy with margin are tracked vs. the assets bought with cash.  The margin is reduced or goes away when the assets bought with the loan are sold.\n\nI've always been able to use unsettled funds to make trades, but the money involved was actual incoming cash not margin.

It has already been demonstrated that asymptomatic people can still carry the virus.  Without testing everyone, we'll only prolong the agony.  I am bearish as well, but not nearly as short as I'd like to be.  A bounce on Monday can only be considered as a gift to the bears.  If we get it, I'll load up further.

You touched on it briefly, but for those who don't read between the lines, the 2016 tax cut that allowed major companies to buy back their stock served only to artificially boost an economy that was in absolutely no need of boosting.  We used most if not all of our ammo that could have been used now.  The companies that bought their stock back with our tax dollars would have been better off burning the money. In short, we were due for a major decline, the market was artificially high. The virus simply got the ball rolling.  \n\nIn addition to the above (as if that isn't enough) we are full of uncertainty.  I don't know of any factor the market hates more than uncertainty.

The best signal i can think of is R0 value falling to around 1.0-1.2 Currently its estimated at 2 and for regular flu is 1.3.\nBy then we will start to see governments opening up again and bull market start. It will probably be another 1-6 month from that to start see spending slowly return (agree with OP that some sectors will snap back faster than others) because we need make sure that there are no second wave coming and really believe that the future is now once again “secure” and “predictable” :)\n\nIts hard to guess  which sectors will snap back fastest and most, because essentials like pharma and groceries are not susceptible to lower consumer confidence (as much) and then you have some companies spiking now (slack, zoom). I would stay away for travel, airlines and cars because i think these will be slower to recover back to pre crisis levels. Also think thats what spurred the extreme bear rally - a lot of investors saw good quality companies at a 30% discount + FEDs safetynet => buy. But even fed cant fix the demand curve and thats the problem here. Uncertainty about when we are in the clear about the virus (health-side) and lockdows (economic-side), so people wait it out. FED money will keep as many business and families as possible afloat (which is good because otherwise i think we would go to a dark 1929 depression like place) but its not before we see demand pick back up that we can start to forecast company profits. So i think market is currently a bit optimistic on the short to medium effects of this on demand the next 2-9 months, so we will have to go lower. \n\n\nLonger term (2-5 years)\nI think real estate and stocks as a whole will do fantastic next 2-5 years: ultra low rates + shit ton of liquidity chasing interest => real estate and stock market ON AVERAGE will benefit. \n\n\nAside: \nWhy is everyone always answering “NO one know what will happen!”. Well - obviously no one knows, but OP is looking for what you THINK will happen. Im super interested in others take on next 2-6 months as  i feel like OP that people are mostly on either far end of the spectrum: world will end —-- nothing will happen (FED got this). Lets have hear some qualified guesses and arguments pls :)\n\nThanks for a great post - and stay safe!", "score": 264, "created_utc": 1585506028.0, "tickers": []}

Then we will see a bounce back to almost the same level. \nFor companies and people this of course will demands economic sacrifices for the next month or two and some civil liberties regarding tracking sick people.

As pot companies need funds they sell their realestate to iipr and then iipr rents it back to them. As pot companies struggle it should leave opportunity for iipr to grow and profit. They are a reit so they pay a decent dividend.

Thought it was interesting.\n\n“For anyone wondering about the reserve build they speak to, I'd like to add a couple of points;\n\n•It includes the impact of adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard (CECL /ASC 326).\n\n•Key difference between old GAAP and new GAAP is that you must now estimate the lifetime expected credit loss for your loans adjusted for forecasted conditions. So as of these 3/31 results, the increase in expected credit loss from the current portfolio over its   entire life is $6.8B - to the extent of the capability & accuracy of JPM's model, this is as bad is it gets.\n\n•Day 1 (1/1/20 no COVID) impact goes through retained earnings (i.e. no income statement impact), but subsequent measurement (i.e. 3/31/20 big COVID) goes through income. Hence the massive pop in reserves.\n\n•They're likely using a multi scenario weighted model and would have shifted the weightings to reflect the COVID environment; think something like 80-10-10 of most stressed economic environment:moderate stressed economic environment:baseline\n\n•Subsequent Q's won't see as big an income statement impact as the delta between prior Q provision (officially Allowance for Credit Losses) and current Q provision shouldn't be as vast.\n\n•You effectively had a black swan event for this adoption where 1/1/20 (it's effective date), you wouldn't have weighted a stressed economic environment as heavily (if at all, we nearly had the tip in 30,000 DJI almost as recently as Feb), versus 3/31/20 the remeasurement date where you have to account for, well virtually total cessation of normal economic activity.\n\nSo when they speak to building reserves (FASB will have a conniption at that language btw), they've assessed their entire portfolio for lifetime expected credit loss. You see the numbers pop particularly in cards, which are unsecured and your loss given default would to all intents and purposes be 100% vs mortgage loans where you've collateral.\n\nAlso important to bear in mind that since ~2018 the bigger lenders have been keeping higher quality mortgage loans on the books (basically they aren't selling top quality 800 FICO stuff to FNMA FMCC much if at all). Those ratings factor into the modeling which leads me to believe that their +$6.8B is pretty accurate.\n\nJPM are very well placed to weather this, as they were in 2008. It's a well run shop under Dimon.\n\nTL;DR: The EPS miss is due to new accounting rules & watch out for any bank who chooses to defer implementation (CARES relief) as it likely means their numbers on the 3/31 run were pretty bad”\n\nEdit: Credit user thekingoftherodeo", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1586882621.0, "tickers": [["FICO", 1]]}

So here goes:\n\nThese articles are written by investment companies and funds and such to make you worry about your experience and decide to pay them to manage your money, full stop. This is the right way to go for some people. However millenials have instant free access to mountains of data that boomers only dreamed of when they got started. Basically, fund managers and analysts  have been paid in the past to do the research you can do yourself, and they are worried about their industry now. Don't be stupid, actually do your research, but also don't give in to fear. \n\nA lot of millennials are broke, it's true. However if you run low on cash you can sell stock and have cash in hand in a week or so, max. This is another opportunity that boomers never had when they were coming up. Buffett bought his first stocks and ran his first portfolio through the mail. Yeah like a physical mailbox. It probably took months to get your cash out of stocks back then if you broke your leg or something. Free commissions is another new thing that makes a big difference. Plenty of inertial thinking around that.\n\nThere are a lot of legitimate concerns about a bubble. So, don't buy risky stocks that have gone up a lot recently. Buy high quality stocks that are trading well below their highest prices. Buy big ruthless companies that will use this opportunity to crush the competition.

Time after time millennials have gotten screwed by environmental things like high property costs, ridiculous student loans, shitty savings rates, mismanaged markets, crazy medical costs, etc, etc. Yup, it's rigged folks. Your choices are limited and your tools are few. Corporations run our country and you might as well participate. They aren't leaving us with many options. \n\nIt's totally plausible that the current stock market is a setup too. There might be another crash, rigged or not, and people might lose money. However these companies in which you own shares are going to do whatever it takes to get back in the black, or they will die. I'm throwing in with them because most other choices are kind of hopeless. \n\nIt's possible that the markets will work more efficiently if more !informed! people participate. I am basically an optimist and this is my line of thinking. \n\nOk, you have a bit of money in the bank and you think it might be a good idea to open a free brokerage account. News stories and haters are making you question your plan. Seems apparent to me that investing your money is a good habit, and now is the least risky time in recent memory. There are stacks of info out there that will help you pick good stocks. Do not take the random advice of inexperienced (ahem) other millennials on Reddit. It's so easy to do your own research. I mean it's your money and you kind of owe it to yourself to make the best moves you can.

We may get to a point technologically where everyone owes gazillions to everybody and we all just throw our hands up and say F#%k it, cancel it all and start over.

Then various bond and treasury holders around the world could try to stage a revolt, but as long as we have the nuclear missiles, that argument is moot.\n\nThe interesting question is, will we allow a private corporation like spacex to gain enough power and control over the planet, that the private capital groups who want their money actually go through a private corporation to execute their revolt?\n\nI believe the US move to create a \"space force\" which can enforce the superiority of our currency beyond the atmosphere, is happening precisely so that we can control the chessboard when the time comes.

See, instead of investing the money into the company R&D to create new/better things, companies are focus on increasing their value on the market. And then they buy smaller businesses to absorb competition, and stagnate everything down (tech industry is a perfect example of this).  \n\n\nI choose to protest by not participating in the current stock market rally. I have no debt and everything I own is paid in full. I know the value of money, so I am considerate where I spend it. I think we do need deflation to happen and people need to realize that leverage must be used wisely and not be taken for granted. Maybe that will stimulate people to be more productive, more creative and more competitive to drive the technological advance further. People are lazy by nature, so if they are not motivated they won't think hard enough. This is from a consumer's point of view.  \n\n\nBut deflation will harm the economy, people will stop buying things.

The limit price is the price you are willing to sell the stock for. Typically, you want these to be fairly close together. If you are setting a stop limit for a stock with a very high volume (let's say Apple or SPY), then you can set these to within pennies of each other, and your order should be filled.\n\nExample:  Sell $V (Visa): activation price: 180  Price: 179.95  When the price hits $180 or lower, and order will be created to sell the stock at 179.95.  High odds of that order being filled at or higher than that price.\n\nIf you are selling a stock that has very low volume, you may need a little more room. So, in your example, you have XYZ company at $300. You want to sell if before it drops below $200, at around that price.\n\nSet your Activation Price at $201 and your Sell Price at $200.  When it hits at or below $201, it triggers the order to sell at $200.\n\nDon't use this for longer than a day, because the stock could gap down overnight and it would not activate; or rather it would activate a sell order, but if it gaps down, the price could be lower than the sell price before markets open and the order would never be filled.\n\nIf you think XYZ company stock could gap down overnight, you may want a wider gap.  So, you could set the activation price at $210 and the Sell price at $190. Stocks trading in this price range tend to not gap down as much as penny stocks and a $20 difference is a hell of a spread for a stock in this price range.\n\nIf you have a stock trading at $5 and you are worried about it gapping down to $1 over night, you are best off just selling the stock before the market closes, to be honest. You can't really set a stop limit that's going to catch every gap down right where you want it.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1591805332.0, "tickers": [["V", 1]]}

{"submission_name": "t3_h8ygcl", "id": "fuu6ah2", "text": "I work in business travel. I think DAL and LUV are both good buys. Short term, LUV is a better buy as it has less international exposure, which is subject to quarantine restrictions. It has a great balance sheet and is very popular with leisure travelers but not so with business travels. Over the past 6-12 months they have tried to make strategic moves to position them better for business travel, being that a good chunk is booked by a TMC. Yet business travelers love FF miles and WN FF miles don’t transfer like the big guys.\n\nDAL is my favorite of the big three, it is more of a long hold at this point with the international exposure it has. Business travel isn’t going to stop, but budgets have been cut and it may not be back where it was until the end of 2021. Personally, over 70% of us already worked virtually, and colleagues with other companies (Sabre, Amadeus, airlines) did as well. Webex/Zoom are used daily, but we all still traveled extensively, as did the clients we book for, who also worked both in the office/virtually. Sales calls, tech inspections, etc- need to be done in person and a LOT is lost on calls, trust me. But when there’s no budget, there’s no budget. So DAL will take longer to come back I think.\n\nAll airlines are adding flights to their schedules starting in July, which is a good sign.\n\nI am less of a fan of AAL and UAL as I think they are at risk for reorg. Just looking at their balance sheets, etc. Not to say the stocks won’t go up and you couldn’t make a few bucks, but the travel stocks I invest in, I do for the long term.\n\nSABR might be a good long hold too.

It's been legal in my state for years now and cannabis taxes represent only a couple percent of state revenue. Revenue growth has slowed as prices have fallen and while it's certainly a net positive, it has not been the major budget boost many thought. \n\nSo while legalization will expand, states and countries can see well enough that it won't be magic. \n\nI really can't see why I'd want to buy stock in growers or producers. For all it's trendiness cannabis is basically just agriculture. It is easy and cheap to grow and the only thing keeping the bottom from falling out on prices is restrictive licensing. \n\nI don't really get the sense that most consumers care that much about branding. I probably buy a few ounces a month and I couldn't even tell you the brand of what I am smoking right now without looking at the jar. \n\nSo what exactly is the value of these companies? That they currently happen to hold a little market share in a hyper competitive industry with little in the way of product differentiation? Further legalization is going to decimate their business as existing major players move into the space. Even the biggest cannabis company will be crushed by Big Agriculture. \n\nLegalization is great and should happen everywhere.

While they aren't going to wall street and buying blocks of stock outright, they are buying bonds. What does this accomplish? It frees up debt obligations from funds that can offload bonds back onto the FED. Why would these funds want to do that? Because of inflation. Bonds are returning next to nothing right now, in fact the interest rate is 0% on treasuries. AND the FED printed $7 trillion new dollars....so you put these two pieces of information together and you see that investors, especially funds and the super wealthy, are scared that their cash is going to become less and less valuable over time. They speculate that the new money printed will flow into equity markets, because investors looking for a return on investment have literally almost nowhere else to look right now....this will drive equities higher and perpetuate the mentality of inflation causing dead cash to fall behind, and that record sidelined cash will get put to work as well. \n\nThis bubble is just getting started.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1592270690.0, "tickers": []}

For a relatively low grade respiratory virus (comparing to prior pandemics), shaving 35% of stock market capitalization was a profoundly emotional reaction that was not based on financial reality. Now, I'm not claiming life won't be changed in some ways permanently, or that 2020 FY's GDP data won't be severe, but the markets forward looking reaction was just insane and not realistic, which many retailer investors realized between 3/16 - 4/1. \n\nThat's the baseline from which we have to approach the effects of the monetary and fiscal interventions that have this far occurred and by all accounts will continue to occur until, at least November 3rd, 2020, of not continuously to 2022 when Powell's term ends.\n\nThe market may seem detached from the economy, but it is not.

I can buy the AAPL $355 call dated for expiry on October 16th, for a premium of $24.63. (This is a real option contract) Every options contract is worth 100 shares, so to enter the trade I need to put up $2,463. ($24.63x100).  (This is assuming I did it tonight)\n\nTo calculate the price Apple needs to hit for you to go breakeven, you take the premium of the option ($24.63) and add it on to AAPL's share price. It's best to do this when the market is closed, because Apple is a very liquid stock. So in my scenario, I would need AAPL to hit $379.63 (share price + premium) to hit breakeven. \n\nNow, if AAPL does not hit the strike price on October 16th, my option will expire worthless, and I lose the $2,463 you put up. Since you would have theoretically sold me the call, you'd pocket the $2,463, and those are your max profits. \n\nNow for the put example. Puts are the polar opposite of calls.\n\nLet's say I am bearish on AAPL, and I think it'll fall to $335 or lower before October 16th. (This is also a real option contract.) I can buy the AAPL $335 put option dated for expiry on 10/16/20.\n\n To enter this trade, I'd have to put up $2,008.00 (premium is currently $20.08, so $20.08x100 = $2,008). Now, here's the difference. Instead of adding the premium to the strike price to determine my breakeven, with puts, I subtract the premium from the strike price to get my breakeven.\n\n So using the example above, I would need AAPL to fall below $314.92/share to have my put be in the money. $335-$20.08=$314.92.\n\n Now, let's say AAPL blows up to $375 a share, and October 16th rolls around, and your option expires worthless. You lose the $2,008 you put up to enter the trade. (This is also assuming I make this trade tonight) \n\nNow, for your example.\n\n>Say I wanted to put down $100 that TSLA was below $1,000 a month from now. First off could I do that, what potantial profit could I get if it was below, and would that be a call or put?\n\nYou'd have to find a option that has a $1.00 showing for the price to enter the trade (which would be near impossible to find) Remember, all options are worth 100 shares. ($1.00x100=$100) Your potential profits are capped at Tesla going to $0, and you'd be buying a put. Let's say you bet wrong, and TSLA tops $1050/share by the expiration date you selected. You'd be out $100, because you bet wrong, and that's how much you put up to enter the trade.\n\nNow, this is not factoring in the effects of the option Greeks.", "score": 37, "created_utc": 1592534231.0, "tickers": [["AAPL", 7], ["TSLA", 2]]}

Either way a lump sum investment in the next 2-4 weeks is probably not a good idea. \n\nHowever, for most investors (myself included) timing the market is generally a bad idea and the best way to make money is by continuingly investing periodically every month when you are paid for years and years. The investments should be mostly in ETFs spread over the world so you aren't exposed to one economy. You should also mix in a small amount of cash, gold (we're talking 5%, if you want to bet on crypto then a small amount of BTC or another metal may be a good idea if your young but this is polarising and should be left to your discretion), bonds (less bonds when younger, more when reaching retirement). The younger you are the more of your portfolio you can dedicate to hail Marys or more specialized ETFs (ie NASDAQ, single companies or 'picked' stocks). In short, the low variance way to get rich over many years is to constantly invest broadly in a boring portfolio taking into account your age, risk tolerance, job security etc. \n\nOne thought I might add to all of this is that half the people here are part of the genuine DCA crowd, they've done it for years and will continue to do it through the ups and downs. There is another group of 'investors'that have emerged that use the same language as the DCA crowd but are using the same talking points to justify their FOMO. The same thing happened during the BTC bubble where people were saying buy now why does it matter what happens in the short term if you believe the price will be higher in 10 years? Now obviously crypto is different but the psychology is the same. If you go all in on tech today and there is a downturn (which is completely possible) are you willing to buy more as you watch your portfolio drop? A lot of the people who are buying the top can't handle the dips and this is why markets always capitulate at extremes, every time. \n\nAnyway this turned out to be a ramble but I'm just trying to give a little more of a response than either 'wait for the crash' or 'Cant time the market!

{"submission_name": "t3_hpu9uc", "id": "fxufpeg", "text": "For short term trading I typically set my stop losses based on support and resistance on the chart. I take sort of a three step approach:\n\n1. Identify support/resistance areas on the chart. Assume that if you're buying at $10, and there's good support a $9.50 and no resistance until $12.00, that means you have $2.00 of upside potential and $0.50 of downside risk, or a 4:1 reward to risk ratio.\n\n2. If my reward to risk ratio is 3:1 or greater, I will enter the trade when I see volume come in. I size the position based on the downside risk and my account size. I tend to never risk more than 1% of my account on any short term trade, since I trade a lot. If you've got a $30k account and $0.50 downside risk, you should buy 600 shares, because 600 * 0.50 = $300 risk, or 1% of your account. Adjust accordingly for your account size and risk tolerance. If you have a smaller account you will need to be much more aggressive to achieve stronger growth. In a small account (< $5k) I would typically risk more like 10-20% of the account on a single trade cause otherwise it will take you years to see any significant growth. This is why it gets easier to make more money as your account size grows. The rich get richer because they can take less risk relative to their portfolio size but make the same gains as someone w/ a smaller account taking a lot more relative risk. Anyway I'm rambling. Here's #3\n\n3. I set my stop loss and targets based on the support and resistance. If the stock drops below $9.50 I cut the trade off for a loss as the pattern on the chart is broken. The loss is already accounted for by my position size relative to the account. The target is $12.00, but I will normally start sizing out on the way there (e.g. sell 1/4 at $11.00, 1/4 more at $11.50 and the rest at $12.00). That's also why I go for a 3:1 or better reward to risk ratio rather than the one most people suggest which is 2:1. At 2:1 reward to risk you can't scale out because your net reward will be lower since you'll never sell everything at the intended target. By being more picky about the reward to risk ratio, I can achieve a better effective reward overall and increase my earnings.\n\nHope that helps!", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1594573971.0, "tickers": []}

I YOLO'd some eyebrow raising trades that did very well during the market collapse, and my portfolio grows today.   Most people here just ride you for the schadenfreude which is not cool IMHO.  Here's my considered advice.  Forget P/E ratios and moving averages.  All the maths was great once upon a time.  Do you know what is really good at math?  Computers.  Your math will NEVER beat the computers doing math and executing trades.  But you are living and working and struggling in the mass of consumers that drive the market and you can use a little social engineering to your advantage.  The world is changing.  Spending habits are changing.  You can't make money on the businesses that already sell a lot.  You can only make money on a business that will sell more tomorrow than they do today.\n\nFill in the blanks:  I believe <business> is going to replace <competing business> in the long run because <reasons>.  We see this today in the form of <personal experiences> which I believe to be a trend that will last because <reasons>.  This stock is a good short term buy because <it went down / I'll wait for it to go down some>.  This stock is a good mid / long term buy because <reasons consumer demand will improve> and <reasons consumers can afford it>.\n\nDon't give up on the maths.  You still need to consider if a stock is overpriced / overbought.  Make smaller bets.  5 years ago you couldn't do this because trades were $10 each.  It would cost you $20 to buy, then sell a stock.  Today, trades are free.  Buy a little.  If it's working for you, buy a little more.  This is such a luxury to have.  Use it to your advantage.\n\nNow think of some businesses:  computers (be more specific), Oil (be more specific), retail (be more specific), energy (I love this sector), crypto currency (waste of time), cars (the easiest of them all, my god, the writing is on the wall here), entertainment (warning: volatility), pharma (worse than entertainment)... and apply a business in this sector to my fill in the blank exercise above.

If you read the Intelligent Investor, you should have learned that day- and swing-trading only benefits your broker off of commission, and you're more likely to lose to the market than to win from it if you play that way. \n\nThe sure-fire way to learn from the stock market is to invest long-term. Not for a few weeks, but for *years*. Treat buying a stock like taking ownership of a company. Place yourself in the position of someone with enough money to buy 51% of a company's stock and think \"would I do this?\" If you want to be a good investor, treat owning stock like owning the company itself. \n\nUntil you've got the basics down, I wouldn't touch swing- or day-trading with a ten foot pole. Without doing proper due diligence, playing that game is a road to frustration and potential loss. I would say focus on honing in your research skills and understanding how to read a 10k, how to utilize tools like Morningstaror Fastgraphs, and how to properly valuate a company to a level where you never again say the words \"I bought Apple at $386 at a discount.\"\n\nDon't feel bad though!

So make the criteria so that you do not end up buying high-quality firms but overpriced stocks.\n\nAvoid day trades. On short-term price action is there to suck money out of inexperienced traders, and does not reflect fundamentals so well.

{"submission_name": "t3_hwg4up", "id": "fyzpty4", "text": "This is funny, I went through a similar thing. I left my job in 2013 to trade full time and did really well, and by like 2016-2017 I was so damn lazy cause all I did was wake up and trade for a couple hours and make my money and then watch Netflix all day lol. Occasionally I'd have a bad day and the market would really humble me and then I'd go into a depressive state for a few days and be a bum until I felt like I got it outta my system and then it was right back to it. It was hard for me cause I wanted to hit up friends and stuff but when you are done trading at 11am all your friends are still at work so I would just fill my time with laziness. Watching TV, browsing reddit, mindlessly cycling between email/facebook/twitter/checking the market/reddit/eat/repeat. It also caused me a lot of losses too cause I would get so bored I'd go back to the market during the shittiest time like the lunch hour and trade just to cure my boredom, and when I did that I would always lose. I even play a couple instruments and would do that to kill time but you can only cycle between your office/studio/living room/kitchen so many times before you start to go insane. \n\nIt's a weird thing because the reason everyone dreams of quitting their job and making their own living is so they can do whatever they want, and we have all these grand plans for the things we're gonna do when we're \"free\" but then when we get there, we are lazy as fuck! \n\nWhat I ended up doing was turning a side project I had been working on for a while into a subscription website. I was a tech dude before I left my job so I had some coding skill, and had been messing w/ Python to do stuff like scraping financial info off various websites and had a bunch of scripts written but no way to manage them, so I started learning Django and built a website to manage them all and when I got it polished up I decided it was worth setting up a payment system and seeing if I could get some side income from it. In the process of building it I also inadvertently became really good at Django and Python, got a mentoring gig on the side helping students learn software development and eventually started writing content for that company for their courses they sold and used that money to fund growing my subscription site. I also started volunteering at a local animal shelter and went and walked and socialized dogs which helped a lot. These days I'm almost completely independent from trading thanks to my software dev work on the side, my subscription site, and then trading to pay the bills, but if I stopped trading entirely I could still survive and I'm working on growing my sub site to the point it will be able to support me with recurring revs on its own. I guess my point is, you're doing well w/ trading but don't write off expanding into other things. Start a side business, build something, volunteer, learn a new skill you can use to create a new revenue stream ... give your life some variety. People covet this \"trading lifestyle\" where you wake up and make $1000 in 30 min and then have nothing to do the rest of the day but the truth is if you ever get to that point it actually really fucking sucks cause you will be bored out of your damn mind lol \n\nI'd also really recommend checking out /r/getmotivated, /r/getdisciplined, /r/getoutofbed, /r/entrepreneur and some of the related subs. They really help me with staying motivated and not becoming lazy just because I \"can\". If you are at the point where you could just stop working entirely and survive for multiple years, it's time to level up, not be a lazy fuck. Give yourself a challenge and overcome it. If all else fails, start donating all your money to charity to put yourself back in the grind and give yourself a reason to hustle!!", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1595520555.0, "tickers": []}

But at around 10 feet   from the receiver aircraft, the RVS doesn't focus well enough to   connect, sometimes causing the operator to hit the nearby   plane...Without an RVS fix in place, Airmen would not only deal with   blurry vision but also issues like a blinding glare off of the receiver   airplane on clear, sunny days.\"\n\n**Pushing ahead in spite of vision problems**\n\nDespite the obvious problems facing the KC-46, the Air Force opted to move ahead with its procurement plan.\n\nIn   Jan. 2019, Boeing delivered the first batch of KC-46 aircraft to the   Air Force, two years behind schedule. At the time, the Air Force lauded  the KC-46 deliveries  as a \"major milestone for our next generation  tanker.\" The service  claimed that the continued design issues,  including the deficient RVS,  would \"not prevent the tanker from  carrying out its primary mission.\"  Indeed, the Air Force was quite  insistent that Boeing would solve the  issues expeditiously:\n\n\"We   have identified, and Boeing has agreed to fix at its expense,   deficiencies discovered in developmental testing of the remote vision   system. The Air Force has mechanisms in place to ensure Boeing meets its   contractual obligations while we continue with initial operational   testing and evaluation.\"\n\nUntil Boeing resolves the RVS issues, the Air Force has withheld about 20% of the value of each plane delivered.\n\n**Grounded by the top brass**\n\nThe   KC-46 is supposed to be ready for operations in 2023 or 2024, but the   top military brass is not yet prepared to clear it for regular service.   The Air Force certainly sounds less confident than it did back in   January of last year.\n\nOn  March 3,  Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein told a Senate   committee that, until all technical issues are resolved, the KC-46 would   only fly in the event of a serious geopolitical conflict.\n\nThey have more leash because they have military contracts and that gives them more leeway to screw up.\n\nIf  you look at defense contracts, Boeing isn't that far ahead of the 3rd,  4th, or 5th contractor.  Lockheed is safe due to that stupid F-35  fiasco.\n\nLockheed Martin: 44.9 billion\n\nBoeing: 26.9 billion\n\nRaytheon: 23.8 billion\n\nNorthrop Grumman: 22.3 billion\n\nGeneral Dynamics: 19.4 billion\n\nTo  think that Boeing is somehow guaranteed to go back to those highs, you  are being overly optimistic. Boeing didn't go over $200 a share until  July, 2017.  $300 a share in December, 2017.  $400 a share in February  2019.  This is with revenue going down.  I don't see why it is  automatically going back to all-time highs.  One final point:\n\n* Boeing net income for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 was **$-0.628B**, a **129.25% decline** year-over-year.\n* Boeing net income for the twelve months ending March 31, 2020 was **$-3.411B**, a **133.69% decline** year-over-year.\n* ***Boeing annual net income for 2019 was*** ***$-0.636B***\\*\\*\\*, a\\*\\*\\* ***106.08% decline*** ***from 2018.***\n* Boeing annual net income for 2018 was **$10.453B**, a **23.67% increase** from 2017.\n* Boeing annual net income for 2017 was **$8.452B**, a **68% increase** from 2016.\n\nI see Boeing spending 2021 making fixes, and start to be on the up in 2022.  There was so much irrational exuberance over them because their stock was low and everyone just said, \"It is covid! They are a defense contractor! They are pure money!\", and people didn't look at them BEFORE covid.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1596238952.0, "tickers": []}

So I see the federal government doing what it has to in order to save the company. Perhaps they nationalize airline manufacturing and aviation? But Boeing will not vanish from the face of the earth. From a long term perspective I see it still here in 30+ years.\n\nThe second thing is what will happen to the Boeing we know. In no uncertain terms, travel will never be the same. People who believed we were slated for a V-shaped recovery were lunatics. Unfortunately for companies like Boeing, Royal Caribbean, American Airlines, Etc, that means business will be much different in the next 5-years than it was before.\n\nIs it going north of $200 shares any time soon?

AMD still hasn’t announced their new CPU or even GPU lineup this fall. They’ve said “Zen 3 is coming” etc, but they really haven’t said much else. Just look what happened when they announced their latest chips, that’s what like 5% of their overall sales potential? If that???\n\n2. Intel just released a new line of processors.

Intel will have NO option but to lower their price, which will lower their value even more.\n\n3. AMD is projected to receive between 30% and 50% of market share in certain fields within the next 2-3 years. They’re currently at 5%. To put that in perspective, Intel will just be spitting out 7nm processors when AMD is on Zen5. \n\n4. AMD is supplying XBOX and PS5 with their two most expensive components; even at a measly $300 for those combos, which could be undervalued, and estimated 100 million consoles sold over the next 3 years on the light side, is 30 billion dollars. Almost a third of their total value right now. There’s no way this is priced in yet.\n\nJust by using some basic math, one could tell that AMD has so much further to go and Intel isn’t looking bright for the next couple of years.

{"submission_name": "t3_i4e68c", "id": "g0j87dv", "text": "10nm is built on quad patterning lithography. Intel chose this route as opposed to EUV, which TSMC chose (incidentally, Intel are trying to use EUV on their own 7nm, which should show you which decision was right). The structure of quad patterning means that it is inherently prone to lower yields. When you combine this with the monolithic structure of Intel's CPUs, it will be impossible for them to produce high core-count chips (i.e. server/TOTL desktop) in any volume with the margins that they've seen historically. No amount of +++++++ will change this fact. I said two years ago that 10nm would be a complete writeoff and I stand by that today.\n\nYour point about IP is very valid. In my models I forecast that AMD will have very little share in the datacentre GPUs (but AMD has their own raytracing implementation coming out with the new consoles; which imo will be more efficient than Nvidia's due to Microsoft writing DXR with AMD's hardware in mind), but their IP helps out massively in the CPU arena. It'll be very difficult for Intel to build a competitor to chiplets without infringing on patents - which is the only way 10nm could be viable.\n\nAs for taking people at face value:\n\n[https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017](https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017)\n\nIntel have announced delays to 10nm by 'a year' for every year since 2016. I don't see anything that would suggest 7nm is anything different.\n\n[https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporary](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporary)\n\nTSMC views Intel and AMD completely differently. It's very much in their favour to help AMD out as much as possible with wafer supply, and limit Intel's own production. AMD's long term success ensures growth for TSMC; while Intel's long term success would mean they reclaim the process crown and constrict TSMC's market share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree that AMD is highly priced right now - they're above my valuation for the first time ever, while Intel is slightly underpriced. However, in the past few years AMD have consistently executed on their roadmaps, increasing their value while Intel has constantly screwed up, decreasing theirs. It's very possible that you buy into Intel now, while its' price> value, but then value decreases as they continue to fail and your price is never realised.\n\nTLDR: The big picture is that 10nm is a total writeoff, and 7nm is looking pretty shoddy as well. They bit off more than they could chew trying to get GaaFets to work. Intel's dominance and past price has been built on its process lead, and losing that lead and having to go to TSMC who will treat them poorly justifies a large drop in price.

Depending on your broker you can also send a limit on open order, or set a buy stop limit for a price you know the stock will open *above* with a limit at the highest price you are willing to pay regardless of the open price. My point here is that just using a simple limit order is tedious and annoying cause you have to keep watching the news and adjusting your order. You could eliminate this by using a limit on open, buy stop limit or if you're really confident, market/buy stop market on open. \n\n2. In general, this is a risky strategy. You really have no idea what the stock is going to do right out of the gate, and it's much more practical unless you plan on swing trading it and holding it for a while to wait 10-15 minutes after the open of trading on it and make a decision based on a 1 min or 3 min chart. this way you let all the crazies gamble for a few minutes and do 10-15 minutes of price discovery before buying, so you're not going in totally blind...you've got some history to use as a measure of where to set your stop loss and targets and so on.", "score": 14, "created_utc": 1597158946.0, "tickers": []}

If you want to go higher, at 10% growth, that will end at a whopping $153,140. \n\nI am sticking with the 7% figure for the rest of this:\n\nAssuming you held until the end of the 20th year, you would owe tax on the long term capital gain on the first 19 years, so roughly $102,300-45,600=56,700 at the LTCG rates of 15% (unless you are in a higher bracket by then, then it is 20%)\n\nAnd tax on the last year of short term capital gains of the last year ($2,493-$2,400=$93) at your ordinary tax rate. \n\nThe break out of long and short is over simplified for this example. Assuming you are in the middle bracket (24%) and that STCG is assumed taxed fully at that rate, and nothing else considered. Tax bill would be $8,505 on the LTCG and like $22 on the STCG, for total bill of $8,527. Even at the highest rates (20/37) you’re only looking at a bill of only $11,375. \n\nYou can look up the brackets and play with the numbers more. The gains are the same, just depends on the rates. \n\nAnother thing to consider, are these indexes paying dividends? \n\nSticking with the monthly values of the 7% growth scenario for simplicity. The average S&P500 stock has a div yield of 2.5%. Going off those assumptions, we get increasingly large 1099-DIVs each year. You can run the calc yourself but it grows exponentially, here’s some highlights:\n\nYear 1: $34\nYear 5: $346\nYear 10: $960\nYear 15: $1,970\nYear 20: $3,632\n\nTotal dividends over the years: $26,504. \n\nSince you are holding all for long-term, and simplicity, assume qualified dividend rates of 15/20%. Again, you can run the full calc but unless you are in the top bracket, you’d pay 15% each year on those dividends for a grand total of $3,976 in tax spread over 20 years. Give or take. \n\nI do not claim to be an expert, I do work with taxes and am a CPA, but I do not know your other income/deductions. This should be relatively accurate but was mainly done for fun since there are too many assumptions involved to be considered an accurate prediction. I would suggest seeing a financial advisor who could help you get a more accurate plan for your specific situation.\n\nEdit: missed the part about non-US resident, please consult a tax advisor, this is far more complex than I can assist with.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1597288759.0, "tickers": []}

Get a feel for what will suit your personality **and** life circumstances the best. Then start putting learnings into practice on a paper trading (demo) account until you're comfortable with how to buy and sell, what the order types do, and the interworkings of everything. Tradingview has a simple one that doesn't require you to sign up for a brokerage.

This isn't a secondary offering or a shelf registration. It's a proposed increase to the **authorized** share count. \n\nIf the company has already issued all of their authorized stock in the form of outstanding shares, they can't actually register or offer any additional shares until more are authorized. For example, say a company has 500 million shares authorized. In their IPO, they offer 100 million shares, turning 100 million into outstanding shares. The other 400 million sit on the shelf, and if they need to raise more capital, they can register and sell another 50 million, 100 million, whatever, until all the **authorized** shares have been issued and are outstanding.\n\nIf that's still not enough, then they need to file the form that this company has filed, which allows them to amend their articles of incorporation to authorize more shares. Those shares could be used to do additional offerings or they could be used as part of a merger, attached to warrants or convertible debt and so on. \n\nThe fact that they are requesting to authorize more shares is not necessarily a red flag or anything negative on its own. The more important question is whether or not the company is habitually dilutive to the point that they have \"used up\" all their authorized shares by doing secondary offerings and now they need to authorize more, or if there's a good reason for more shares to be authorized. The form should give more detail about why they need to do this and what their plan is but like I said I haven't read it in detail yet. One other thing you might want to look at is any outstanding debt they may have coming due in the near future and how much cash they have.

{"submission_name": "t3_ieyu4y", "id": "g2lmcaa", "text": "Buying a individual stock is ideal, however it requires due diligence and research. You will see the most gains in picking an individual stock that grows over time. For example, $AAPL Apple has had returns of over 100% this year. $tsla Tesla has had 390% gains. $AMD has see huge gains and was the largest winner percent wise last year. It traded last year for around $35 a share and now around $83. Remember buying a cheaper stock too obtain more shares is a bad strategy. 1 share of a company that has returns of 30% is better then owning 10 shares of a company that only returns 5% all things be equal if investing ~500. Sometimes you can’t buy 1 share because it costs too much. Take $AMZN for example or $TSLA. So you could see if your broker offers fractional shares as a service. If not you have several options. You could invest in a quality stock while you accumulate the cash to buy a higher price stock you have researched and expect to go up. Another opportunity would be to invest in options via simple calls. Options allow you too leverage a smaller amount of cash to control the right not obligation to buy shares at a future date. For example, if you think $AMZN will continue to increase in price you can buy a call option 3-4 months from now with a higher strike price or price you think it could be at. 1 contract controls 100 shares. If $AMZN rises the value of your option also rises. You can then sell it back. You will want too research this strategy and make sure you understand it before doing it. \nIf you are just looking for returns and do not want to invest the time building a diversified portfolio then buying a ETF that represents segments of the overall market is your best bet. I would buy $QQQ which is the Nasdaq 100 . Technology stocks have performed the best in the last 10 years and I believe will continue fir a long time. You can goto the pro shares website and compare $QQQ to any other index and it has outperformed them all.

In terms of dividend stocks, I really like Disney (DIS). They are continuing to produce because of their online revenue and Disney + subscriptions, but because of COVID, its biggest attractions are not being put to use.

None.\n\nReal estate is a great investment but either you're the landlord type or you're not.  I am not the landlord type.  I can do minor repairs but I can't do major work.  I find people harder to deal with than stocks.  I simply don't understand real estate as much as I understand stocks.  If you're not a real estate person, that's not going to work for you.  If it's for you, then great.  Pursue it and make money and I respect you for that.  EDIT:  You can also flip houses but that's not for me either.\n\nSo while there's other less common investments, stocks are the only game in town for me.  I think a lot of people are like me and I think there's more investors than ever with Robinhood and partial shares so I think stocks deserve a higher multiple than ever. \n\nSo what else am I going to do?\n\nIf you never invest at all time high, you're basically never investing in it.  You would have spent from 2011 to 2020 waiting, still bought at a higher price AND lost out on any dividends.  Inflation alone drives the market to higher prices.  EDIT:  not necessarily all time highs like I said but when the market is up, people get scared and the market went up that whole time.\n\nAlso, if stocks run up 10% and then crash 20%, you didn't lose as much as it sounds.  And if stocks crash, usually other assets are hurting too so it's not like you chose a loser.  Those stocks will also recover so what are we talking about?\n\nRegarding a potential crash, I don't understand the fear.  A boat in the harbor is safe but you don't build boats to leave them in the harbor (I slaughtered that quote lol).  I'm not investing money I need to live and at 35, I can survive a crash.\n\nI think people get too caught in fear and these high level ideas when sometimes you just need to look at the thing in front of your face and go for it.

{"submission_name": "t3_ikpu4w", "id": "g3njyk4", "text": "Seems like quite the battle. Walmart has old infrastructure (brick and mortar), and Amazon started later so they probably have more tech framework.\n\nFor example, Walmart doesn't seem to have extremely-fast dropshipping, so I hypothesize their online order to warehouse to shipping sequence is inferior to Amazons. I would further that conversation by asking, who do we think will be able to implement drone-based shipping sooner?\n\nHowever, it is a strength of sorts for Walmart to have stores in many if not most cities. I would test this strength by considering two main types of online purchases: common items such as Crest toothpaste, and esoteric items such as a 0.25\" derma-roller. Basically order an item that would exist locally in a Walmart store and one that wouldn't from their online store, and perform the same test at Amazon. Test which ones consistently ship faster. This should reveal some unseen infrastructure coefficients.\n\nAs an extension of that common vs. esoteric item test, an aggregate analysis is due for probing the implications of ordering online + shipping and ordering online + in-store pickup. Walmart crushes in this regard, but Amazon could potentially add store fronts in their warehouses and/or shipping facilities, so it will be important to track that if you maintain that Walmart has a comparative advantage.\n\nAs a Canadian, I find one drawback for Amazon is that, if an item ships from China, it's game over. It will take 2+ weeks, sometimes upwards of 2 months to arrive. Walmart doesn't seem to be as interested in these esoteric, low footprint items such as PCIe to 4 USB peripheral hardware for a computer.\n\nIn addition to this difference between common and esoteric items for Amazon and Walmart, I find that Amazon's reputation seems to be worse today because, as a company, they seem to be orders of magnitude more sociopathic than Walmart in the ways they treat employees as time-tracked cattle and have issues with lacking intent for cleaning up bot-riddled fake reviews and counterfeit/low-grade third world companies. Amazon is a network of third party sellers. Walmart is one seller that acquires products and then sells them.\n\nI would ask the question, what will the future bifurcation be between frequency of online purchases vs. in-store purchases? If Amazon can use their current infrastructure as item pickup touchpoints, that brings Amazon pretty analogous to Walmart in terms of physical location saturation (and related logic). Shipping velocity strikes me as the most important attribute. In my opinion, that seems to be a critical factor in quantity of demand, more so than brand reputation. Both companies have significant economies of scale. Walmart seems less infested with both endogenous and exogenous dark triad vectors.\n\nAnd of course, make sure a person studies \"dark shopping cart patterns\": [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf) Both Amazon and Walmart seem to heavily deploy those grey area ethics techniques. At the moment, whoever is using more of those is probably capable of harnessing more sales if traffic is in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nAlso don't forget Nike's recent movement to push transactions from external sources to their domain. This is significant, in my opinion, because it implies potential aggregate movement from centralization to decentralization. It begs the question, what other brands might try this, and who exactly is going to handle shipping when shipping velocity composed with total cost is among the primary concerns. Maybe we will see more aggregator websites with outbound links to shopping carts? I wouldn't want to assert much specifics here in the way of solutions, but an Occam's Razor will be converged upon via regression to the mean as free market mutations iterate from here, now.\n\nAlso don't forget that Walmart's market cap is $417 Bil, and Amazon's market cap is $1.75 Tril. That's a difference by a factor of 3, almost 4. Amazon also owns data via AWS that relates to transactions on all websites and servers using their database stores, etc. In some ways, the limit of Amazons comparative advantage approaches disgustingly-great as the amount of compared metrics approaches infinity.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1599001475.0, "tickers": [["USB", 1]]}

What the order means is the President requires certain government agencies to provide guidance in determining which projects are eligible for government support, which can include loans or grants. The agencies are also directed to use available authorities to accelerate the issuance of permits in connection with the expansion the supply chain for specified minerals.\n\nIn 2020, China will account for roughly 70% of all graphite produced, while the US only accounts for 1%. The United States Government is mandating this to change.\n\nCurrent price $6.60/share\n\nIn Monday’s session, WWR shares opened at $5.90 per share after gapping from Friday’s close of $5.75, closing the day at $6.60 (+14.78%) per share. Trading volume was strong at 12M shares.\n\nLet’s look at the graphite picture:\n\nThe market for graphite is growing. Every battery for an electric vehicle, cell phone, tablet, laptop, solar panel, and a plethora of other devices needs graphite. Every pencil and many lubricants use graphite. A diverse number of analysts place the growth of graphite consumption at 6-20% annualized growth rate.\n\nThe USA needs a source of domestic graphite, produced in large quantities and produced in an environmentally safe manner. Right now, America imports 100% of the graphite it consumes. The USA is literally at the mercy of its offshore trading partners for supply. China is the largest supplier, currently producing 70% of the world’s graphite. The graphite mined in China uses hydrofluoric in the refining process, creating a dangerous environmental cost. Westwater has filed a patent for their claim on an environmentally safe proprietary process.\n\nThe US President has issued an Executive order stating that America’s reliance on foreign sources for the minerals used in batteries a national security threat and advises government agencies to offer miners credit, other financial help, and ease in permitting to develop a domestic supply of graphite and other minerals used in batteries.\n\nNow let’s look at Westwater Resources:\n\nWestwater owns the most advanced graphite mine in the USA, located in Coosa County Alabama on 42,000 acres and called the Coosa Graphite Project. A Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) technical report for the Coosa Graphite Project was completed by AGP Mining Consultants Inc. in November 2015 and included an Indicated Resource of 78,488,000 tons, grading 2.39% graphitic carbon (Cg) at a 1% cutoff grade, for a total of 1,876,000 tons contained/in-situ graphite—the largest graphite Indicated Resource in the United States; and Inferred Resources of 79,443,000 tons, grading at 2.56% Cg at a 1% cutoff grade, for a total of 2,034,000 tons contained/in-situ graphite.\n\nCurrently, Chinese graphite sells for $500 to $1600 per ton depending on the flake size with the larger flake size going for a premium.\n\nWWR has developed a method of processing graphite into its usable form that does not use hydrofluoric acid and has the potential to eliminate 300,000 tons of carbon emissions annually. The process is proprietary and is patent pending. The company is currently building a processing plant and in conjunction with three other facilities is processing 30 metric tons of graphite utilizing their new technology. This is happening right now!\n\nThe US government is involved in the development of a domestic graphite industry and WWR seems to have all the needed requirements to do just that in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\nThe US government carries stores of gold and oil to protect our national security. Could minerals for energy storage devices be coming into that equation?\n\nWWR looks like it could be a ground floor opportunity, right now while the share price is low (54% off its October high). Keep in mind, the public float is only 15.78 million shares.\n\nWhat is graphite?\n\nA non-metallic mineral, Graphite is one of two natural forms of carbon (the other is diamond). With the highest natural strength and stiffness of any material, graphite is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. It is stable over a wide range of temperatures. Graphite is a highly refractory material with a high melting point (3650°C). Graphite has a high natural lubricity and is one of the lightest of all reinforcing agents. While chemically inert, Graphite also has a high resistance to corrosion.\n\nThis is not investment advice im an autist", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1612229627.0, "tickers": [["WWR", 2]]}

I know these are hard questions and no one can predict it, but I just can't help asking :) I have actually sold out all I have last night (I'm not in US), so I ask mainly because I'm curious (also, I'm waiting for the time to buy again :).

The people who bought shares for covered options don’t actually want to hold them and dumped them back on the market and other shareholders that buy rumor and sell news dumped too. That’s why Apple stock dumped all last week, lots of people dumping their shares after the event. Tesla has similar overwhelming demand for options that causes share price to bubble and after event prices to fall.

What happened afterwards?  Intel struck back with the Core, Core2, Core I series and reasserted dominance, this is part of a macro-cycle within the industry.  Why did Intel \"lose\" its product lead?

Yes, however considering they are also sitting on 25B of CASH ON HAND, pretty sure they'll be able to regain footing and bounce back.

If you expect you only have 10-20 years left on this planet and no one to inherit, consider a safer alternative. Nothing really changes.  \nLast year around this time there was big talk about a huge resession expected within months or possibly weeks, and calm people reminded everyone that the same had been said the year before that. People keep guessing when it is all going to fall, and one day someone will get it right, and the one who gets it right gets crowned the new King or Queen of predictions, mostly based on luck.\n\nThe ones who need to worry are traders or people looking to make a quick buck. If you worry about getting rich fast, you will worry about lost opportunity, but no one can accurately predict how things are going to go. The bubble will burst, that is the only certainty we have, no one knows when, so again, be in it on the long run.   \nInvest in companies with a solid concept, companies you believe in and want to support, and you really don't have to worry that much. Supplement your investments with gold, silver, cryptocurrency etc if you feel inclined, and try to take the backseat.  \nLost opportunities is basically another word for \"unbought winning lottery ticket\" for the most part in my book, and the only time you can really start talking about lost opportunity is if you choose to stand outside this whole thing out of fear, or holding onto your money with it's value minus inflation in hopes of catching the stockmarket in it's perfect downfall.", "score": 20, "created_utc": 1604255817.0, "tickers": []}

The news of Pfizer’s vaccine caused a lot of movement everywhere, leading to an increase in airline and hotel stocks and a decrease in stay-at-home stocks. However, it is important to keep in mind \n\n1) Distribution will be an issue. Even if the vaccine was proven safe and released tomorrow, actually getting it out to people would prove to be an issue\n\n2) According to polls,[only 58% of Americans](https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/10/19/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-racial-disparities/) would be willing to get vaccinated as soon as it was released. This number is down from the 69% that was reported in August. \n\n3) The movement we saw November 9/10th should be compared to the rest of the year. A 5% increase in the month of November doesn’t equate to huge profit if your stock is down 20% for the year. \n\nWe all know that eventually, Covid-19 will end, but it won’t be happening any time soon. Way too many people get pissed about wearing masks and staying home,so it only makes sense that the US is handling the pandemic terribly. \n\nBelgium, Hungary, France, and the UK have all announced a 2nd lockdown.

There would be no economic growth, no innovation, no new IPOs and ventures that investors can take advantage of, etc. since there's no money left to be made.

No middleman of 3rd party warehouse, huge undercutting of pharmacy pricing, ever improving delivery performance, etc. It’ll grab that market very quickly which is significant. The thing I’m not understanding is the partnership with all these pharmacies..haven’t figured out why they would work with amazon. Short term benefit to long term very bad impact in my opinion.  Maybe Amazon is talking to them about being a warehouse provider to them eventually (ie if there is one loser here it is McKesson). Pharmacies companies shedding capital etc invested in warehouse sector, similar to how all cell companies in areas rent from companies that solely put up towers.\n\nThe next phase is the one that will be very interesting and where the meat is: insurance companies and their massive customer base. Amazon will have to offer an insurance model of some kind, either an enhanced prime membership etc. With the integration in other pharmacy groups with both insurers and carriers, Amazon will not be getting those customers..., but their insurance prime might begin attracting companies to move their health plans over. \n\nIn my opinion there won’t be many players left: amazon, walmart, and cvs/caremark.

This push gained momentum after the Luckin Coffee scandal (btw, it was a Chinese firm that exposed Luckin).  \nAnalysis: this is just a leverage play to force China to come to some form of agreement. US investors, hedge funds, pension funds have already invested billions into Chinese companies. So there is a strong incentive for both countries to work something out.

SRAC in particular sounds cool, but it's just so speculative that I'm not wanting to take the risk at the moment. My quick summaries:\n\nDesktop Metal (TRNE) has some pretty lofty \"shoot for the stars\" financial ambitions, but their actual products have recently started making the rounds and are seemingly well-received so far. Also, the fact that they've attracted interest from BMW, Ford, Koch, Google Venture, etc. is a pretty big plus. Their merger finalization date is next week too, and movement is already starting to pick up. This is one I think has a lot of overlooked hype if it does well. Long term, they'll either be huge or fizzle out; I don't see much of a middle ground. \n\n\nAvePoint (APXT) is attractive to me because of how well they are managed. Zero debt, actual profit and demonstrable growth. They are dependent on Microsoft, but Microsoft partners with them directly and has a good relationship from what I've found. If you look back a few years ago, AvePoint's products were initially unfavorably compared to companies like ShareGate, but more recently they apparently made a pretty big effort to step up their game; their reception in the past year or so has shifted very positively. If you have reason to think Microsoft 365 will unexpectedly go under, maybe avoid this one.

Have cash aside for further investments whether its dollar cost averaging / averaging down your initial investments or buying into new ones.\nThese could be be ETFs like the ones by ARK or individual stocks. \n\n6.

And if it does, is that a future we even want?\n\nAgainst a lot of judgment from what I could find online, I decided to start an “IPO collection” Holding about 30 stocks in my portfolio and few additional index funds - I’m trying to hold about 10 IPO stocks with long term vision to really see what can happen overtime. Which I hope in a decades time will really show which was the better investment. Apple’s amazing now - but the real people investors benefiting are people who got in decades ago, not the the small fries like myself buying less than a billionth of the company in the 21st century\n\nAirbnb, Unity, and Snowflake all burst out the gates from their valuations - so far Unity and Snowflake have seemed to show overall positive from their valuations - and even if a bit optimistic, they are like safe bets that guarantee value long term \n\n- If you’re into Game Dev, you might realize how big Unity and Unreal really are and how much room they have to grow - At conferences like GDC in SF, the Unity and Unreal Booths are potetionally bigger dogs than Microsoft, google, and sony (And the sort of direct competivness Unity has with Unreal is healthy competition for long term growth in innovation (like apple and Microsoft growing in unison.)\n\nSnowflake hosts some big names out there (quite a few companies you might own yourself! Providing data storage for companies like Sony, Caterpillar, Take Two Interactive, a whole bunch more) and these cloud platforms essentially have your data locked into their platform so it’s harder to leave)\n\nAirBnB suprised me by doubling out the gates - Even if it gets corrected, will continue dollar cost averaging in for the long-term. The community is very strong, giving the company a long-term stability - Really good experiences with the company as a host, customer, and knowing employees, the margins are huge and the room to grow is very much still there.\n\n—-\n\nLooking forward, am very excited to get in on Roblox too. 20 years later and I still love Legos, roblox seems to me, to be just as long-term visioned as Lego. -The platform is set up in a way for developers to be able to create content fast within the eco-system, for a seemingly infinite supply of content.

As VTOL/ aviation/automation become more streamlined, I see a very profitable future for Uber with their long term visions\n\nZuora - The backbone behind many subscription services - recently got caught up in legal trouble, out of all listed this has been my worst performing to date.\n\nWarner Music Group - If you have some idea how royalties work maybe you can see how big of a buy this is. Michael Jackson was only as crazy rich as he was because he understood the royalty game. Imagine every single song is a copyright, yea? And every single time it is duplicated, there’s money involved. Every single click on a streaming service, play of an advertisment, cover of the song, show. And this is the publisher, owning multiple artists - collecting money virtually every single second 24/7/365 paying back to you in some dividends\n\nLemonade - My most short-sighted IPO, I see lemonade has the ability to grow like wild fire and I will dump as it finds it and multiplies 10x from my investment", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1608045241.0, "tickers": [["SPCE", 1], ["GOOG", 1], ["SNE", 1], ["AAPL", 1], ["rblx", 1]]}

These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them. \n9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!\n9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself. \n10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback. \n11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. \n11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it. \n1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in. \n2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price. \n--- \n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves. \nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile. \n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”. \n@here \nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade \n1.    Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk. \n2.    Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily. \n3.    IV Percentile – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk. \n4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa. \n5.    Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value. \nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price. \n6.    Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low. \n7.    Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%. \n8.    Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them. \n\n(Full Post)", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1608289747.0, "tickers": [["AAPL", 1], ["GOOG", 1]]}

If you are young, invest in some index ETFs across the entire equity market spectrum with a higher focus on the US (large cap, mid cap, small cap, REITs) but still some exposure to international and emerging markets. If you are planning on living off the money now or in the near term you would want to add some highly rated corporate bond exposure and a little high yield exposure. You really don’t need mutual funds for most US equities but honestly they add a lot of value in the real estate, bond, and international markets. There are managers that actually consistently outperform in those spaces even net of fees, but since you won’t get institutional share classes with the lowest expense ratios nor possibly the time and effort to research the right funds to pick, you might be better off with indexing those as well. I don’t know how much time you plan on actually spending on figuring this out, but that plays a role in deciding how passive or active you want to be. I have seen people mention there are funds that track the best dividend payers and the so called ‘dividend aristocrats’, but they shouldn’t be the end all be all and would maybe satisfy a piece of your large cap exposure. \n\nDefinitely don’t blow it all in AT&T or Exxon, but if you want to make a few individual picks in industries you actually know about and understand the basics of stock and balance sheet analysis then there’s nothing wrong with that. If you want to add some income to the account, look at selling covered calls on the stocks or ETFs you pick up, or selling covered puts to get into them in the first place.\n\nThe most important thing you need to know is that you don’t need to use all the capital at once, and that you should do a lot of your own research to check what anyone tells you on here. I love reading all the different investing subs and get the occasional idea I like from some of them, but at the end of the day you need to be able to independently verify whatever you are reading.

Companies fall from grace all the time. \n\nThere is a reason \"T\" and \"XOM\" have large dividends. It is because they face headwinds. T has issues with a giant chunk of their users either dying (boomers) or cutting the cord on their cable subscription. They have a $158 BILLION in debt (although perfectly manageable in the near-term since they are cash flow kings). I don't have to tell you why XOM faces an uphill battle in the future. But in the near-term, you might make plenty in dividends and perhaps even reinvest some of the extra cash. But looking forward a decade or two, the underlying stock value will potentially erode. And often what follows is a cut in dividend. Which would be a big problem for your retirement plans.\n\nSo yes, diversification is good. Today there are tons of low fee ETFs and mutual funds that can still provide enough to retire on (as long as you are willing to live frugally and in a low cost of living area). \n\nI recommend SPYD for this approach. It is an ETF that holds the 80 highest dividend generating companies in the S&P 500 (and that includes XOM and T). The dividend averages around 4.5%, although in very sudden down turns it can briefly dip as low as the 3% range as it did earlier this year.\n\nAnd I don't want to open a whole can of worms but perhaps talk to a professional about investing in \"O.\" It is a REIT which means a real estate company (kinda). The cool thing about O is that it generates dividends MONTHLY instead of quarterly or annually. So you'd basically get your monthly allowance. And the dividend IS THE KING OF STABLE. Just [look at this baby](https://imgur.com/gallery/hKLycmP).\n\nTheir website touts the following: *605 Consecutive Monthly Dividends Paid,  93 Consecutive Quarterly Dividend Increases*\n\nSo this went a little long.

The idea here is to get paid every month so that you have consistent cash flow, so it’s best to find companies that have opposite payout schedules.\n\nAnother thing that you didn’t factor in is the taxes that you would have to pay on those dividends.

Your question has been given numerous, great answers already, but I wanted to point out something else you may not know about: insurance.\n\nI’m not sure what nationality you’re from, but you definitely need to think about what insurance your brokerage firm(s) have. This protects your stocks, funds, etc. in the case that your broker goes bankrupt. \n\nFor example, in the U.S., all assets held in brokerage firms are covered by federal SIPC insurance up to $500,000. This means that if you put $1mil in with just one broker, half of that money is immediately at risk. If the broker goes bankrupt, you will lose half of your money.\n\nMy advice would be to split it up between several different brokers. If it was $1mil, I would park $250,000 with 4 different brokers, so that all of the accounts are completely covered and have room to grow the balance.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1608491092.0, "tickers": []}

They end up using leveraged ETFs but it’s possible to do something similar with margin, options or futures.\n\nThen there is the “leveraging while young”/“lifecycle investing” type threads that address using leverage over your lifetime to improve lifetime risk adjusted return. Essentially you try to spread your equity exposure more evenly across your life, using margin when you are young and reducing your equity allocation in retirement. Like a lifecycle fund but based on theory not a rule of thumb.\n\nI’d suggest looking into NTSX, it’s a 60/40 balanced fund leveraged 1.5x.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1609001509.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_kkkax9", "id": "gh4zckd", "text": "I’m shocked there isn’t a single comment that says it’s okay to do this. \n\nI would say it’s fine under certain circumstances. It depends how risky the rest of your portfolio is. If it’s risky, I would suggest keeping margin at 10% of total purchases. If it’s not risky, 20% should be fine. Risky is generally more cyclical or higher PE stocks. Not risky includes dividend payers and low beta stocks. Generally, you’ll be fine. \n\nBasically, I would say there’s a time to run (aka take on margin) and a time to walk. Right now is a time to run in reopening stocks. Green light go. Once we’ve leveled off, I would suggest dropping it to 10% margin, and then you can take it back up to 20% margin on the next 10% dip, and then take it back down again when we hit a new high. Generally, this is a safe strategy that will perform slightly above average. \n\nI say all this without knowing your tax situation. If you are in a higher tax bracket, margin makes less sense. Short term gains are almost 50% between federal, state, niit, and maybe city taxes. It doesn’t really make sense to take margin up and down to pay 50% in taxes. The additional returns from margining are minimal over long terms. If your tax rate are low though,  then it’s a better scenario in which to take on margin. \n\nAnd as someone else suggested, consider just selling puts on stocks you like, or way out of the money near term calls on the stocks you own. You’ll be paying up to 50% again, but it accomplishes a similar low risk, low return goal. \n\nOverall, if you are going to get a 10% return, and you can margin up to 11%, you need to ask yourself if it’s worth doing at all and have to worry about it. Personally, I only use margins on big dips. I have margined maybe a total of 30 months in the last decade. Has worked well for me.\n\nBut it is potentially risky if you don’t know the risks.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1609043179.0, "tickers": []}

I've been using the Apple Fitness trial (3 months) and honestly... really like it. Pairs great with the Apple Watch. Most days I'll just do a core workout, ten minutes, before my actual workout. HIIT ones are challenging. Hopefully they actually add some iso strength workouts in the future and ability to sort workouts by body part in the future. Now that's just one part. I use the iCloud storage, Apple Music, and perhaps Apple TV in the near future. Bundling these offerings is only going to increase the appeal and exposure.\n\nHow do you see that 2025 prediction potentially shifting given the Apple Car? Understanding this is all speculation - but if they somehow hit it out of the park with a game changer, it's hard to phantom where the stock could be.
