t3_1u6s5x,How to get the Most out of /r/SecurityAnalysis,"It’s the start of a new year and I wanted to post some helpful hints on how to get the most out of /r/SecurityAnalysis. Additionally, I want to ensure the content and comment quality in this sub remains high as subscriber growth continues.

* **1.	Read the Sidebar and Use the Resources there**

I don’t think people understand how useful the links on the Sidebar are. I have come to use many of the resources there regularly. Here are some resources that have been helpful for me:

**[Reading List](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/107tal/updated_reading_list/)** – There are great books for learning about all aspects of Value Investing. The Reading List is separated by topic for ease of use and is updated about once a year.

**[MBA Finance & Valuation Classes](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.ca/2013/02/its-time-new-semester-begins-and-you.html)** – Damodaran’s classes are a great way to improve your Corporate Finance and Valuation skills. Lessons learned here become very powerful when combined with the unit economics of the businesses you examine. These links are updated when a new series of classes is uploaded.

**Financial Information** – [EDGAR](http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) and [SEDAR](http://www.sedar.com/search/search_en.htm). I read a lot of financial statements and I prefer to get them directly from the source. You miss out on information that companies are providing to the financial regulatory authorities if you only read 10-Ks and 10-Qs. In addition to other financial filings, also examine at press releases, earning call replays/transcripts, executive interviews, business articles, and books about companies/industries.

**Stock Exchanges** – Many countries don’t have an entity like EDGAR or SEDAR, but company financial information can be obtained directly from the stock exchanges. 

**[Ben Graham Centre](http://www.bengrahaminvesting.ca/)** – This is the website for the Ivey Business School in Canada. They have a great value investing tradition and their website has links to Value Investing academic research, Guest Speakers, and other resources.

**[Value Investor’s Club](http://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/value2/)** – Contains stock pitches from value investors that usually have a special situations angle. Steal ideas from where Greenblatt steals ideas from. If you want to see what a good stock pitch and analysis looks like, sign up for a guest account here and read the highest rated ideas.

**[Macabacus](http://macabacus.com/)** – Has many great financial models available to download for free. Examining the structure and formatting of these models will help you improve your financial modelling skills. I recommend that you combine these models with Damodaran's Corporate Finance & Valuation Classes.

**[Whale Wisdom](http://whalewisdom.com/)** – I shamelessly steal ideas from other investors. Every once in awhile I find a new fund that is worth tracking by browsing the posts there.

* **2.	If you’d like to discuss securities, your post must contain analysis**

Analysis is not a recitation of P/E Ratios or Growth Rates. Analysis should mention how the company’s business, assets, earnings, industry, or other factors makes the security you’re discussing undervalued.

Your post doesn't have to be as thorough as the ones on Value Investor's Club. For example, look at what [bigwoody did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/p333a/energy_stock_manifesto/), what [Coldheat did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/qadv8/btctake_a_look_and_tell_me_what_you_think/), what [paperpump did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1qi93s/long_pitch_par_petroleum_parr/), or what [currygoat did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1jtbyt/quick_and_dirty_washington_post_valuation/). We desire to keep the discussion in this sub high level and want to prevent it from devolving into mindless chatter.

**Your post will be deleted if it does not contain any analysis as baseless speculation helps no one.** It is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation.

* **3.	Ask Questions**

Asking questions fosters worthwhile discussion and helps people improve their skills as an investor. Please don’t attempt to answer questions if you don’t know the answer. Once again, it is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation.


* **4.	Post interesting articles about Investment Search Strategy, Investment Analysis, Value Investing Philosophy, and Risk Management Techniques**

You'll find plenty of things to post if you read with an active mind. News, especially business news, should be read as events that people make happen rather than things happening randomly. Once you start asking why people are making these things happen, the news will become an examination of how companies respond to their competitors, how products evolve to meet the needs of customers, and how management creates or destroys value for shareholders. Each bit of news about a company or industry can be used as a building block to a case study in valuing companies.

* **5.	If you don’t know how to analyze securities, read books in the reading list, use the resources on the sidebar, and ask questions**

I’m aware this is essentially the same point as #1, but I want to reiterate how great the Sidebar is. **Use it.**

Everyone starts their journey into Value Investing somewhere. Regardless of where you are on that path, /r/SecurityAnalysis isn’t a bad place to be.

t3_1vvhry,Thoughts on Declining Revenues? (Pfizer),"Hello everyone,


What is your thoughts on a company that has declining revenues? Typically I have a rule of thumb that if a company has two years in a row of declining revenues that I sell. This may seem ignorant but I would rather have my money in growing companies.


I have owned shares of Pfizer for a little while now and it came up on my portfolio annual review as one to sell as they have had now 3 years of declining revenues. However it appears the answer isn't so simple.


PFE's stock has gone up in almost a straight line over the past five years. However it isn't necessarily the business outperforming but a mixture of cutting R&D and share buybacks to boost EPS.


Last year they spun off Zoetis which has around $5billion in annual revenues. If shareholders would have received ZTS from the spinoff I wouldn't be having this discussion and be more than happy to hold.  However they did an IPO and shareholders did not get any shares. As Pfizer continues to spinoff businesses like this what should I do with my position?


They do have steady cash flow from their consumer brands (Advil, Centrum, ChapStick, Robitussin, Preperation H, Thermacare) and still have strong sales from a couple blockbuster prescription drugs (Lipitor, Viagra, Chantix). So there is very little risk in the business, they are setup for success. Not to mention a 3.30% yield.
Because of their declining sales though they have a PEG ratio of an outstanding 4.56!! How can I ignore that? That is the highest PEG in my entire portfolio. This a strong indication I should sell.

t3_1wdfxy,My Research into InvenSense (INVN). The Future of Tech? (xpost /r/investing),"I have been doing some research into InvenSense (INVN) lately and am considering buying and holding for a long time.  Honestly I first heard of the stock because The Motley Fool was pushing it.  Normally I don't listen to other's opinions but the idea seemed legit and I started to dig.  The more I started to read, the more intrigued I became.  There are some short term risk factors with the company and stock but I believe long term that they can overcome those obstacles.

Before learning about this company it is first needed to understand what the future of tech is going to look like.  I have posted about this before on how ""The Internet of Things"" is going to take over this economy.  Every ""thing"" is going to be connected to the internet and will be able to communicate with each other.  One of the most important ways this can happen is with sensors.  Below are some links to get you started to explain how the ""Internet of Things"" will transform the way we live:

* [Quartz 3 Part Series](http://qz.com/156075/internet-of-things-will-replace-the-web/)
* [GE White Paper](http://www.ge.com/docs/chapters/Industrial_Internet.pdf)
* [Cisco White Paper](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoT_IBSG_0411FINAL.pdf)
* [Mckinsey Report on Disruptive Tech](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/disruptive_technologies)

InvenSense makes and produces motion sensor technology, mainly gyroscopes and accelerometers.  This is essentially behind all of ""The Internet of Things"" due to be able to pinpoint and track your actions of what you are doing at all times.  All smartphones/tablets/smart TVs have these in them now.  They are moving to a point of wearables for fitness devices and smart watches.  

Last year they just came out with image stabilization sensors to install for cameras of smart phones or other applications.  Go Pro cameras and large media cameras use stabilization sensors in them for example.  As their major customers are smartphones and tablets, this is an excellent complementary product to sell to the same manufacturer. Also they are producing industrial sensors to sell to major companies though not much for actual sales yet.  

There are random other uses for the sensors.  Do you ever see those toy remote helicopters?  InvenSense sensors are in those. I know Reddit itself is hardly a place for research but go check out [/r/ECE](http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/1jduau/gyro_inverting_its_maximum_or_mimumum_output/) and see what they think of InvenSense.  There is also an article of the [Nexus 5 Components](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1pcmda/nexus_5_indepth_components_list/) list with it in there.  Currently they are also using the technology in small toy robotics as well.

Now think bigger, do you know what this means?  These guys are one big industrial contract away from being behind the sensors that enable the tech infrastructure build out.  This is what will power autonomous cars, it is what will take entire train fleets under better management (Check out the [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2014/01/22/americas-second-rail-boom/) I have posted before).  InvenSense in the future will be behind drones, advanced robotics, and a smart infrastructure/power grid.  If things go right, they are the future of tech.        

So what is holding me back?  Well prior to 2007, they had 0 revenues.  Their first big break was with Nintendo.  They are the ones who powered the Wii remote and the Wii Motion Plus.  Sounds awesome right?  Nintendo was 85% of their total revenues in 2011.  Guess what has happened to Nintendo since then?  

Their ""Gaming"" segment (aka Nintendo) has decreased by about 50% over the past year.  As an offset however, their tablets/smartphone division has increased by 47% which is an increase in sales as the device segment is 74% of sales.  Their Optical Stabilization and Other segment has grown 128% YOY.  

* [Segment Reporting](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=8DDDE01AC2383407!2592&authkey=!AOTtz5gP104C07k&v=3&ithint=photo%2c.jpg)

So even though they are doing fine as Nintendo struggles, they are behind all of Samsung and now which result in a small majority of InvenSense's revenues. 

""For the three months ended September 29, 2013, two customers each accounted for 36% (Samsung) and 14% (Nintendo) of total net revenue. For the six months ended September 29, 2013, one customer accounted for 31% (Samsung) of total net revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2012, three customers each accounted for 29% (Nintendo), 19% (Samsung) and 17% (Quanta) of total net revenue. For the six months ended September 30, 2012, three customers each accounted for 22% (Nintendo), 19% (Samsung) and 15% (Quanta) of total net revenue.""

So essentially, if Samsung starts to struggle like Nintendo is, it could be real problems for the company.  However they have a fortress of a balance sheet and their business model allows for flexibility in scaling up or down.  

InvenSense is generating cash hand over fist.  Now they are no Apple but currently they have over $161 million in cash and short term securities on their balance sheet.  Their current ratio is an outstanding 9.3!! That is nearly unheard of.  On top of that, the company has zero debt.  If they grew revenues less than 35% next year, they would be able to pay for all of their Cost of Goods Sold right now if they wanted to.  They are in no risk of going out of business any time soon.    

Next is their business model.  The company does all of their manufacturing over in Taiwan and leases all buildings and equipment.  This is great because there are no hard assets to maintain on the balance sheet and it allows them to scale up or down with minimal cost. 

Because there is very little liquidity risk, the company has nearly doubled it's R&D expenditures, moving from 10% to near 14% of total revenues.  This is a good sign for the future to fuel the innovation going forward.  

As they sit to report in a couple of days, their valuation is set fairly high.  Currently trading at 32x earnings, it is not cheap.  One thing that is of note is that they have been steadily issuing shares, about 7 million more shares over two years, which amounts to about 9% dilution.  I am not sure as to the reason behind this and it needs further research.  Because of the issuance of shares their EPS did not move at all even though there has been explosive growth in revenues.  It doesn't make sense to me that a financially stable company would dilute their shares like that if there was no reason to raise money.  It could be through stock options though as 36% of the company is owned by insiders.

If InvenSense can diversify it's customer base to different device manufacturers (aka Apple) and get into the industrial sector, there can be explosive upside to this stock.  As more and more people obtain smartphones, their sales and cash flow will continuously improve.  

Even though expensive now, I believe that the company will thrive in the future and has the liquidity to survive any bumps along the road.  I am going to be buying 1/2 of my wanted position before earnings, and the other 1/2 after I see what the results are.  These are just my assumptions here, but Samsung will probably come out with a slight increase in device revenues (even though quite amazing) and Nintendo's revenues will continue to fall.   

With a market cap of only $1.7 billion, there is a lot of room to run and the company is just scratching the surface of it's potential.  I intend to hold this stock for a long time and build a sizable position in it.",4,0.7,1390921083.0

[Here's a pdf of the spreadsheet I created](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31025117/LMCA%20nav%20valuation.pdf).

Since LMCA right now is really just a holding company with various stakes in other public companies, estimating the intrinsic value of the company should be fairly simple and straightforward. I estimate the intrinsic values for the larger holdings that LMCA owns, assume all the smaller holdings are trading at fair value, estimate the value of the privately-owned companies, add the cash, and subtract the debt. This gives you an estimate of the net asset value of LMCA as a whole—about $20bn total. On a per share basis, it's about $186 per share compared to a current market price of a little less than $130, which is about a 30% discount.

I've owned LMCA for over a year now and am happy to discuss the company and do my best to answer questions if you have them.",7,0.89,1392003003.0

t3_1xt8lv,Technology Investment Opportunities in Canada: BSM Technologies (GPS),"BSM Technologies is a telematics supplier for the rail, construction and utility industries in North America.  For those unfamiliar with this technology, I would recommend going to BSM’s website or to Wikipedia.  BSM makes its money by selling hardware units and software services (SaaS) on a recurring basis that are used to monitor fleets of vehicles.  The company currently has a market cap of $120mln and net cash on its balance sheet of $25mln.  In 2014, BSM is expected to generate $28mln in sales and $5.85mln in EBITDA and free cash flow.  The company has been both net income and cash flow positive for the past 3 years while experiencing growth north of 30%.  

Aly Rahemtulla, originally an investor and now currently CEO, is responsible for much of the company’s transformation and success over the past few years.  Unhappy with the way the business was being run, Aly came on board as CEO in 2008, divesting underperforming segments and focusing the company primarily on the rail industry.  Shortly after, BSM won a major Teir 1 rail contract in Canada supplying its technology to the rubber-tire maintenance fleet.  To date, the company has a strong position in 4 of the 7 Teir 1 North American railways, is in discussions with the remaining 3 and has begun selling units to short line railways.  Furthermore, the company has won significant contracts with utility customers such as Bell, MTS, The Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York, Hydro Quebec and a variety of others.

BSM’s value to customers is simple.  Their technology provides fleet optimization (reducing the number of required vehicles), fuel savings, and lowers maintenance costs.  The ROI is highly visible and customers are quick to see the benefits of rolling out telematics solutions.  Specifically, customers report 7% savings on fuel and greater than 10% improvement in fleet utilization.  In most cases, the technology pays for itself in less than 1 year.

The total market opportunity servicing the rail vertical alone is 40,000 units.  Today, the company supplies ~8,500.  BSM charges $400 - $700 per hardware unit (depending on the model) and $25/month for the software.  Therefore, there is $12.6mln - $22mln in potential hardware sales and $9.5mln in recurring software revenue left to be rolled out.  The recurring software revenue is very high margin (75%) and ultimately is the source of cash flow for the business.  Therefore, management is working hard to secure sales of hardware units.  Outside of rail the opportunities are equally significant as evidenced by previous customer wins.  

In January of 2014, the company raised $22mln at $3/sh in the open markets.  Since then, the stock has sold down to $2.50 – absolutely terrible performance.  Why has this happened after all the positives I laid out above?  Is it valuation?  With Canadian tech companies like Constellation Software at 17x, Descartes at 16x, Avigilon at 23x, Enghouse at 15x, Computer Modeling Group at 21x, Redknee at 16x, Solium at 15x versus BSM currently at 15x I do not believe this is the case.  Instead, I would attribute the performance to a lack of announcements regarding acquisitions or new contract win.  However, this is where investors are being given an opportunity.  

The last acquisition (Autovision) was done at $14.7mln and added EBITDA of $2.5mln.  At the current multiple, this added 15x $2.5mln = $37.5mln gross value or $37.5mln - $14.7mln = $22.8mln of net value. Given managements criteria for acquisitions (strategic, profitable and accretive), the deployment of $25mln in cash can create significant value for shareholders.  I estimate that optionality, which we are currently getting for close to nothing, is ~$30mln on a current market cap of $124mln which equates to 30% upside on cash deployment alone.  Then we have synergies plus base business execution.  

There always exists risks with small cap technology investments but I can point to few that are as well capitalized, profitable and growing at the speed of BSM.  Outside of public markets, Telematics continues to be a very attractive investment area in North America due to the recurring nature of cash flows.  A gap continues to exist between BSM and other telematics companies publically listed in the US (e.g. 18.5x for Fleetmatics). Ultimately, I believe BSM will get acquired for their foothold in the rail industry. 

Interested in hearing others comments.

t3_1xz375,Wild alpha strategies for growing tiny AUM,"I'm amazed by how low barrier to entry value investing has become - people with less than $100k try to adopt the same principles as Warren Buffett.  To me, the reality appears as though value investing only makes sense at scale.  If you start with $100k, and post 20% returns for 20 years straight, you get to $3.8 million.  Phenomenal returns % wise, but lousy absolute dollar wise.  You might as well take the $100k, lever it up and get into the property ownership/development business.  You'll probably end up with more than $3.8m after 20 years.  If you're below 40 years of age, and you think that your chances of raising a fund are minimal for whatever reason, I don't see much point in actively managing your money if it's too little because you're likely to make more money employing your skill otherwise.

t3_1y9jev,Canadian Stocks: Investing without resources II,"Approximately 2 years have passed since I followed up on my earlier post (http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/nxuuo/canadian_stocks_investing_without_resources/).  Let’s start by reviewing investment performance assuming we employed a ""buy and hold"" strategy, equally weighting the 3 recommendations.

As of Feb 2014, GLN declined 20%, EIF was flat and ACQ increased 580%.  Therefore, an equally weighted portfolio would have returned 187% versus the broader TSX which returned 23%.  Despite two stocks that underperformed during this period, I will consider the last two years a victory.  I would also mention that this experience provides evidence in favor of taking a portfolio approach to investing.

So what happened with GLN and EIF?

As a reminder, Glentel is one of the largest independent wireless retailers throughout North America. The company holds licenses to resell mobile phone and data contracts for both Rogers and Bell in Canada as well as Verizon in the United States. In 2013 the company undertook an expansion project aimed at growing the business outside of North America. The attempt was unsuccessful and the company was forced to take a significant write-down to reflect this underperformance.  Although disappointing, Glentel’s North American business remains strong and management has proven its ability to grow the business in this region.  Since 2011, Revenue and EBITDA have grown.  Therefore, investors are assuming the company will continue to destroy value going forward.

In my opinion, investors are discounting the company’s shares as a result of this past transaction and drastically undervaluing the core business.  The company continues to generate significant amounts of free cash flow which it returns in the form of both regular and special dividends (currently yielding 3.7%).  Management is highly motivated through their 35% stock ownership and therefore I believe is working hard to fix their past mistakes.  In the meantime, the dividend offers appropriate compensation for patient investors.   

Exchange Income Fund decided to make an acquisition of a mobile tower construction company in the US.  The company they acquired, West Tower, has a contract with AT&T that increased in scale dramatically since the acquisition.  As this occurred, management lost control of expenses resulting in segment margins well below expectations.  The company is trying hard to fix these problems but, admittedly, it is difficult to determine whether or not they will be successful.  Management has been changed and a review of business processes has been ongoing.  It will likely take a few quarters before these issues are rectified.

Comparable companies such as MTZ in the US have very good businesses in this area of the market.  That said, it took them many years before they got to the level they are today.  I therefore believe EIF will require time before they resolve their problems.  The dividend payout is high yet management has said they are committed to its sustainability.  My concern is that it takes longer for the company to recover from their missteps and management will be left without any options other than reducing the dividend.  As a result, this investment is under review.

Why is Genworth trading at such a discount to its tangible book value? It currently has a market cap of $7.5 billion and a tangible book value of $14.3 billion. That is a 48% discount.

It is not loosing money nor are its earnings and free cash flow diminishing from what I could tell from the financial statements. Genworth is trading at 7.5x free cash flow and 13.5x earnings.
If it traded at tangible book value it would be trading at 14x free cash flow and about 25x earnings.

Why is this so undervalued on a fundamental basis? Is there something wrong with the company?

Also, why is Genworth not doing a massive share repurchase right now? Like something to the tune of 4 billion dollars? Which is, 53% of their market cap. I think they could afford it. They could fund it by a combination of funds from operating activities and selling long term investments. Or they could just use their long term investments in securities only.

""But WaMu is more characteristic of a growth retailer. It's just substantially undervalued."" 

2004: Why he'd sell: 

""Nygren says he'll closely monitor the company's retail expansion. If the dollar amount of deposits drops or the pace of checking accounts opened slows, he'll consider selling.

""The growth in the retail bank is just as important to us as the earnings number,"" he says. Otherwise, says Nygren, he'll hold on at least until WaMu's share price approaches $48.""
 
2005: Best of all possible worlds: 

""Meanwhile, the banking unit continues to thrive, says Oakmark's Nygren. Killinger opened 184 new offices in the past year, helping drive up WaMu's net income more than 22% in this year's third quarter.

You can't argue with the numbers. The stock sells for just 11 times trailing earnings, well below the multiple of the S&P 500. Profits are projected to grow at an above-average rate of 10% a year for the foreseeable future. And the dividend yield, at 4.7%, beats the yield on a ten-year government bond.

t3_20c6mi,SEC document printing tip using Adobe Acrobat extension,"I know many people these days read 10-Ks and other SEC filings online, but if you're like me when you really want to do in depth analysis, nothing beats hard copy where I can take notes and highlight however I like.  That said, over the years I've probably gone through a ton of paper printing out documents and I was always bothered that the page numbers on the SEC documents didn't match the printed pages.  The typical problem is that I get lots of extra physical pages printed that are basically just wasted.  For instance, on my hard copy print out it was pretty common to see the page number 10 from the filing printed on the 15th or even 20th page of my physical print out.  This drove me absolutely nuts and I resorted to printing multiple sheets per page and doing duplex, or 4 pages on one physical page so that I didn't wind up with a half a ream of paper for a single filing.  My poor eyes did not like this solution.

Recently though I figured out that if I first convert the pages to a PDF using the Adobe Acrobat extension in Chrome, I can dramatically shrink the number of physical pages that need to be printed.  For instance, this morning there was a filing that I wanted to read that printing directly from the web page to my printer said would take 190 pages.  After first converting to a PDF using the trick above, it cut it down to 98 pages.  

I don't know if this trick will work for everyone or on other platforms, but I thought I would share in case anyone else here still reads hard copy and has had that same frustration.

t3_20jy4m,Cash on the balance sheet: what is it worth? Comments from Greenblatt,"From Greenblatt's 2005 Columbia U class notes: 

Current Assets: (CA) First we look at CASH.  

You can value the $5 in the company’s pocket but it is not in your pocket. What will the company do with that cash? How will they redeploy the cash?
Will they dissipate the cash or use it wisely like returning it to shareholders? Look at management and decide if they are capital destroyers. How is their bread buttered, do they own a lot of stock or are they paid mostly in salaries.
Look at where the business is—is it earning money, is it earning $ in other businesses? Is management doing good things with the money? 

If management is doing good things, I may put full value on that cash. Or I won’t take it at face value if the business is losing money. Make sure it is net cash. They may need more working capital so I may have to haircut the cash figure. I usually give a discount to the cash on the balance sheet. Generally capitalism works. Are these guys’ losers. People running a business are generally more entrepreneurial. Are these guys treating it like their own money or somebody else’s money?

There always nuances. If I am not sure, I will put a very conservative value on the cash to take care of that uncertainty. You may say you know what; this $5 should only be worth $3.

t3_21vb25,PHH Corporation,"PHH Corporation is a mortgage originator, servicer and vehicle fleet manager that I have been looking at. Currently a $1.5 billion market cap. From my rough calculations I think they have a conservative $500 million - $800 million in free cash flow. Does anyone know why PHH is trading only at a multiple of 2x -  3x free cash flow? 

I am not sure if there is a significant reason that they are trading at such a low price, unless my free cash flow calculations are completely wrong, which I am pretty sure they aren't. The only reason I can think of that they are trading at what I believe is less than intrinsic value is because they have $5.5 billion in debt... which I think could pretty easily be paid off with their free cash flow and their $1.2 billion in cash. PHH is also trading at tangible book value + mortgage servicing rights (intangible).

Does anyone else know something about this company that I do not know? I have not looked too deep into it. Is there something incredibly wrong with the company? Or does the lack of fair value of the stock have to do with interest rates probably going to rise within the next few years?

If PHH is truly trading at this big of a discount to their intrinsic value, I wish management would repurchase a massive amount of shares. ",6,1.0,1396305792.0

t3_220ebk,Question regarding growth of the derivatives market and equity prices.,"Hey guys, forgive me for the lengthy post but I was hoping someone might have some insight on my question.

The question is how does growth in the derivatives market affect stock prices? I'll explain my idea below and was hoping for some insight.

People are aware that QE has added about $4.5 trillion dollars of liquidity to the market. The fed buys back bonds which gives capital to the banks allowing them to lower rates and lend more easily. Unfortunately, consumer lending has only marginally increased as a result. So the extra money must be entering the market.

If we consider a very basic equation MV=PY [money supply * velocity of money = price level * GDP], this is concerning. The money supply has increased, and the velocity of money has increased a little as well, in my opinion driven by increases in liquidity. 

But the other side of the equation has not increased, so maybe there is a missing variable. I believe that this variable is found in the form of leverage in the derivatives market. 

The derivatives market has grown to unprecedented levels. It is about 40% higher in terms of volume from 2008. The vast majority of the volume is found in interest rate swaps (which inflates volume as the notional principal is not exchanged, only the difference) but I still wonder how these transactions affect equities.

There is research that suggests that the tightening of credit spreads and interest rate spreads is strongly correlated with rising stock prices. I do not have a clue if there is any causation behind this.

But if there is this relationship, then does the extra QE leverage manifest itself in the interest rate swap derivatives market, leading to tighter spreads, and ultimately artificially inflating equity valuations and liquidity in stock markets?

Out of my own interest I'm starting to try and write short equity research papers and derive my own buy/sell/hold recommendation -  not for myself or anyone to invest based upon! Just as a hobby if you will. 

I see people saying for interviews, if you might be asked about 2 or 3 stocks to pitch, you should analyse 10 or so to make your choice. How long would an analyst typically take to build an equity research paper? I realise that experience and years of knowledge of a company will help on the long run, but if you were thrown a new stock that (hypothetically) you weren't really aware of before, in an industry that you understand, How long would it take? 

Are we talking hours? Days? Weeks?

t3_224wzt,Feedback from SA community on Interactive Brokers,"I wanted to ask the SecurityAnalysis community for feedback from anyone that has used [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/main.php).  I currently use TD Ameritrade for my personal accounts but after reading Flash Boys and learning more about the chummy relationships between HFT firms and brokers and their apparent willingness to selling their customer order volume to the highest bidder, I emailed Ameritrade about my concerns and got an unhelpful form letter back in response.  So, now I'm looking to explore alternatives where I have more control over how my orders are executed.  I don't trade a lot (maybe ~30-40 times/year), so this isn't so much an attempt to save money as it is to vote with my feet against what I feel is a current market structure that benefits financial intermediaries instead of investors.

Apparently Interactive Brokers is the only retail broker that is connected to [IEX Group](http://www.iextrading.com/services/#subscribers) (Brad Katsuyama's firm), so I think I'm going to open an account there and fund it with a small amount of money to evaluate it.

t3_22swp6,Spirit Airlines - Forming a Thesis,"A while back I listened to a NPR Planet Money Podcast interview with Spirit Airlines CEO Ben Boldanza which really caught my attention. The business model and the company culture really stuck in my head (even though I am not sure I would want to fly Spirit myself). I believe Spirit (SAVE) exhibits some characteristics of other high quality businesses.
I would like to prove out my theory (one way or the other) by doing some analysis and was wondering where are some good places to start as I am not an experienced security analyst. Although I do have access to Capital IQ and Bloomberg through my day job. In addition I wouldn't mind hearing what other people think about the stock.

*Ben Baldanza seems to be a highly capable and passionate CEO. I don’t have any solid data points but he seems to potentially be shareholder friendly in terms of capital allocation.  Unfortunately he does not have a large stake in the firm

*Spirit has a company culture oriented on cutting costs. Examples include their bare bones corporate headquarters.

*As part of Spirit’s strategy of “unbundling” their service for their customers they are focused on gaining market share by giving back to the customers to increase the loyalty effect. (scaled shared economics).  In a recent WSJ article discussing the potential downfall of Southwest there was a chart showing how all of the major airlines prices have increased in 2013 relative to 2008, but Spirits ticket prices actually went down.  This reminds me of Costco. http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303949704579459643375588678

*Spirit exhibits signs of being ahead of the innovation curve. Whether it is in terms of marketing, willingness to advertise within the airplane, or putting sleeper beds in the cargo hold they are clearly not afraid of taking little bets.  http://www.amazon.com/Little-Bets-Breakthrough-Emerge-Discoveries/dp/1439170436

*Spirit largely has a bad reputation, but it doesn’t seem to have stopped them from keeping people coming back and filling up the seats. I think the bad reputation stems from customers going to a website and seeing the cheapest flight and buying it without knowing exactly what they are getting into. Leisure travelers who are either not bringing carry-ons or paying for their carry-ons via internet beforehand seem to be repeat customers. (An unaware traveler who brings luggage to the gate will be sorely disappointed as Spirit charges for ALL extra services. They also charge more for more human involvement. For examples it is more expensive to check a carry-on on the internet rather than with a human. This allows Spirit to staff less employees and boosts their margins.) Baldanza has admitted that they are trying to do a better job of getting the word out there about how Spirit works in order to avoid dissatisfied customers. 

*Spirit offers a $9/month subscription for repeat customers, which enables savings for repeat customers. (Costco)

*Spirit maintains a 30% gross margin which is well above the relevant competitors. Spirit barely has a toe in in terms of market share. Their biggest markets right now are Fort Lauderdale and Dallas right now. This year they plan to add flights in Baltimore, Detroit, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis and Philadelphia for a 22%. If Spirit can continue to steadily, but conservatively expand while keeping its margins intact I would think that would lead a healthy shareholder return.

*The stock currently trades at a trailing P/E of 23.5 which seems expensive, but that doesn’t factor in future growth.  Spirit’s cash from operations has grown from 69 to 195 million between 2009 and 2013. They currently have no debt and a healthy cash cushion. Their fleet is relatively young and they have more in the pipeline. (On a separate note, I believe they only have 1 type of planes which makes it cheaper in terms of maintenance. Employees only need to know 1 kind of plane. They only need parts for 1 type of plane.) 

So those are my thoughts on Spirit and I would love to hear what people think as well as what kind of analysis I can do. Don’t mind taking criticism as well.

t3_238fus,Short interest in PRAA,"Portfolio Recovery Associates (PRAA) buys defaulted consumer receivables from companies for a significant discount to face value in order to make a profit off collecting the receivables for more than they paid the other company for the receivables. I see nothing wrong with PRAA and they are one of, if not the, biggest and most efficient debt collector in the industry. They are not highly leveraged, they are trading at 15x increasing free cash flow (mostly due to bettering economy albeit), they are very efficient, yet they have a short interest of about 20% (35% if you subtract large institutions from the float).

Just wondering if anyone knew why there was a bear view on the stock. Also, another question, if PRAA has paid for $78 billion of face value receivables for $3.3 billion, how much of that $78 billion would they actually receive in the form of revenue? do they make a very large return on their investment?",6,0.88,1397699186.0

t3_23s6vx,"LBO model equity rollover. How do I deal with an LBO transaction financed partly by debt, outside equity, and ownership in the new company?","Hi Reddit!

I need help creating an ownership structure in an LBO model where both debt, capital, and equity (in the new company) is used to acquire an existing company. Also, i need to include transaction costs in the calculation. I do not have any experience with this type of transaction but I have outlined my method below. Could you help me figure out if I am doing this wrong, and if so, how I could potentially do this in a better way?

Existing shares outstanding: 100

Price per share: 100


Sources:

New debt 9000

Management equity investment 500

Equity to existing owners (40% of new company) 3620

Buyout fund equity investment  4930

Total 18050


Uses:

Repayment of existing debt 8000

Purchase of existing equity 10000

Transaction costs 50

Total 18050

Using the above uses and sources I have tried calculating the new ownership structure as following:

Total # of shares (existing shares oustanding - (new debt - existing debt)/price per share) = 100-(9000-8000)/100 = 90 shares

Prior owners # of shares: 40% of new company * 90 =  36 shares

Management # of shares: Management equity investment / price per share = 500 / 100 = 5 shares

LBO fund # of shares (residual) = 90 - 5 - 36 = 49 shares


Is this an appropriate way to calculate the new distribution of shares given the investments above? The reduction in the total number of shares is due to the fact that more debt is issued than what is currently outstanding, thus the excess liquidity is used to buy back shares from existing owners.

Also, how do i treat goodwill from this transaction where the LBO is partly financed by equity in the new company? Say the book value of the company is 3000 and the purchase of the existing equity is 10000 as per above. Do I then have 7000 in goodwill or do i need to account for the fact that part of the 10000 is paid with by equity in the new company?

I hope my question is understandable and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

t3_23xdmi,Can someone please help explain how you would do stock valuation and forecasting for this company?,"Hey Reddit,

My girlfriend has been really stressed out about a project she's working on in her Security Analysis class and has hit a wall. I'd like to help but I'm a science major and essentially clueless when it comes to anything finance. I think all she really needs is a push in the right direction so if anyone has any suggestions or input, we would both greatly appreciate it!

So from what I understand,  the project she's working on is to pick a company and forecast/analyze it's stock. She chose Foundation Medicine which uses genomic sequencing to develop a personalized cancer treatment plan. The main problem she is having is the fact that they are the first public company of their kind and just had their IPO a year or two ago. This makes forecasting and stock valuation difficult because she said normally you would factor in data from competitors and the company's past earning statements. Since Foundation Medicine is the first public company offering this kind of service and since they're such a young company, how would you suggest going about forecasting and doing a stock valuation? She's done lots of stuff like this in the past so I know that there's something about this specific company and scenario that is posing the problem.

I'm sorry if I did a bad job explaining this. If anyone has any specific questions about the project, I can relay those to her. It would be awesome if anyone has anything to contribute. Thanks!

t3_25f22v,Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM) vs. Globalstar (NYSE:GSAT),"I was just wondering about the massive valuation difference between both Iridium Communications and Globalstar. They are both satellite phone service providers that provide satellite coverage to their big clunky phones literally all over the world. Many of their customers are commercial fishers/government employees/or other people that are away from civilization and regular cell phone towers. Many of their customers require these satellite services to conduct their operations whatever they may be. 

So about this massive price difference: 

IRDM: 

* Annual Revenue of $380 million

* Cash from operations - changes in working capital - necessary maintenance due to depreciation = $120 million in annual ""fcf"" (This free cash flow is normalized)

* $1.05 billion in long term debt

* Has about 68 satellites in orbit right now

* **Market Cap: $575 million (4.8x fcff)**

GSAT: 

* Annual revenue of $83 million growing at like 8% annually

* Has consistently lost money and just reported $4 million dollars in cash used in operations. Then after that, $45 million in capex on $90 million in depreciation.

* $670 million in long term debt

* 36 satellites 

* **Market Cap: $2.75 billion**

So can someone tell me what Globalstar has going for it because I am obviously missing something here. What does Globalstar have that Iridium doesn't? Is Globalstar just incredibly overvalued or Iridium just undervalued or a mix of both?

This is assuming the company does not have higher internal return opportunities.

So my question is this, assuming tax rates are equal and the company has already made the decision to return a significant chunk of capital to shareholders, would a company still want to wait for the stock price to be undervalued for the company to favor share buybacks over a special dividend? 

Why? I feel like the answer is the returned capital is shareholder money and they should decide how to allocate that capital, rather than the company investing it in overvalued stock. However, the company does reduce share count regardless of the stock price. It seems like an argument for the share buyback is better than the special dividend regardless of the stock price.",9,0.92,1401368455.0

t3_2794d6,What am I missing here?,"Ticker Symbol: RICK. Rick's Cabaret. Essentially a chain of strip clubs and adult oriented restaurants. They own most of the real estate. Have a market cap of $102mn. Debt of $85mn, but obviously the real estate is held at cost and they have been acquiring it since 1995. LTM EBITDA generation of $29.6mn, which means they are trading at EV/EBITDA of only 6x(3/31). Buffalo Wild Wings trades at 14x(admittedly no debt). RICKS has an EBITDA/INT PMT ratio of 3.9x.

Worst case scenario, someone comes in, breaks up the company, sell all of the real estate (at $140mn conservatively?), pays off the debt and you are left with a 35% loss assuming you don't get paid anything for present and future cash generation which is doubtful.

But it gets better. The CEO owns 17% of the company so his incentive to perform is there. The management team has expressed a willingness to CONTINUE their policy of buying back shares. In addition, the CEO has paid off debt and used new cheaper debt to open new clubs when it makes sense.  On top of that, during the most recent earnings call they talked about their plans to spin off the real estate into a REIT. I'm still fuzzy on the implications of this but I think at the very least this would save on taxes.

On a side note, they have no unionized employees. In fact, their biggest assets in that of the dancers (no pun intended) are not even employees in every state but one. Even though I have never been to one of these clubs, it seems that they are more professional, create better atmospheres and have better controls than other clubs of that ilk.

Of course there is the glaring fact that these are indeed strip clubs and remain unsavory to the general public. But the unloved industry is exactly why it is so cheap. There are other cons that could arise in the form in unexpected regulations and problems that could arise in specific venues. 

Overall I don't think people are ever going to stop going to adult clubs and RICK's can use their economies of scale to their advantage. They are also diversifying into more sports bar type restaurants. As they become larger  In terms of market cap and as hedge funds pile in the market cap should begin to reflect the true value of the firm.

t3_27hoqp,Recovery rate and exploitation cost numbers for oil and gas fracking?,"Hi,

Intro: I have read the presentation of Century Management about ""Value Investing During Worldwide Quantitative Easing"" (search in this reddit). The presentation recommends to invest in natural resources (and related companies). I agree with the presentation. Players like Buffett and their energy company buys strengthen my opinion. 

I did a quick research about energy and fracking companies. From an economic stand point, fracking is only feasible if the revenues cover their cost. The pro fracking arguments are that fracking will does that, but I cannot find any numbers on recovery rate over time and drilling costs. Can you help me?

The contra fracking arguments (from economic standpoint) is that the recovery rate decreases sharply over time while the drilling cost increase because easy wells are exploited firstly.

My second idea was to view this problem from a game theory perspective. The US bets full on the fracking card and builds huge infrastructure for that - requiring lots of hydro carbons to be profitable. On the other hand lobby organizations push hard to reduce regulative restrictions for fracking which causes more and more political opposition. So why would I as lobby group risk opposition only to exploit now, what I could exploit in 3-5 years with less opposition. This tactic is used in Europe which exploits contrast bias of voters. The lobby might be greedy or worse has to provide more hydro carbons to keep their investments profitable.

t3_28k0ma,Is my explanation of the Ocwen mothership that Bill Erbey has created correct? Does anyone know of any other companies like these that are all inter-related?,"I thought it was very interesting how Bill Erbey is in control of these 5 companies and how they are all related, help each other in some way, were spunoff from each other and how Bill Erbey is the chairman of all of them.

The five companies are:

Ocwen Financial

Altisource Portfolio Solutions

Home Loan Servicing Solutions

Altisource Asset Management

Altisource Residential

And probably more spinoffs from these companies to come

Ocwen is a mortgage servicer. Home Loan Servicing Solutions provides the capital to acquire Mortgage Servicing Rights because they have a high yield and they trade above book value so they issue shares above book value to acquire those MSRs that Ocwen Sub services. Ocwen also buys its own MSRs as well. Altisource Portfolio Solutions was spun off from Ocwen and they provide the technology to Ocwen that allows them to service the mortgages. They also provide a lot of other services. One of Altisource Portfolio Solutions most valuable assets is Hubzu (which I believe will eventually be spun off) Hubzu is a lot like Zillow but it deals with foreclosed homes. Hubzu is trying to get into the non distressed house listing market just like Zillow. Bill Erbey claims that Hubzu makes 4 times as much money as Zillow... Zillow has a market cap of $5 billion. (Not saying Zillow's market cap is justified) Altisource Portfolio Solutions has a market cap of $2.6 billion... So if they were spun off I see a lot of value that could be created for shareholders. Altisource Residential handles the foreclosed homes that Ocwen deals with and turns those homes into Rental Properties. Altisource Residential is a REIT. Altisource Asset Management provides services to Altisource Residential. Fun Fact: If you would have bought Altisource Asset Management (AAMC) on its first day of trading in December 2012 and held it until now it would have been a 58 bagger... In a YEAR AND A HALF

But yeah I just thought the relationships between these companies was very interesting and fun to look at and value each one. I think I explained all of those correctly. Does anyone know of another group of companies that are like this that are all connected in some way?

t3_2906hs,Wouldn't this be a better way to calculate ROE?,"Probably just me having a mental fail...

But it seems to me the way we calculate ROE is incorrect.  ROE is, simply, Year x Net Income / Year x Equity.  Mentally, the issue I keep circling back to here is that this does not use the level of equity that was used to generate the Net Income.

As Net Income for a period grows, equity is growing along with it. So if I want to know, for example, given a specific amount of equity, what Net Income it yielded(and then subsequently get the % return on that), it would make more sense to use the equity balance from the period prior to the one you are using for Net Income. This would be true because it is the equity at period 0 that created the net income  that we are starting with at the beginning of period 1 (or rather the period 0 end of year report).

This is probably more clearly shown mathematically; if you wanted to calculate ROE for 2012 it would be more accurate to do:
Net Income (year end 2012) / Equity (year end 2011).

I am probably committed a mental sin somewhere here since people much smarter than myself do not do this, but I would be interested to know where the error in my logic is.

Any thoughts?",12,0.94,1403647561.0

t3_292pk3,How would you value this company?,"I'm struggling on how to value a particular company. Below are my initial thoughts, but I was wondering if there's a better way?
-no comps, company has been public for only a limited amount of time
-it was an LBO, basically right before the market downfall so the worst time to load up on debt
-they have been using fcf to pay down debt, & also refinancing. 2011 debt was around $7b and now it's down to $4b
-Business: generates cash, low capex (~1.2% of rev) and working cap (0.5% of rev); EBITDA margins should continue to increase from 13% to 15% within the next few years

The way I look at this is that right now, based on FY14 numbers, metrics are skewed b/c of how much interest they need to pay. This, I guess what we can call non-operational debt load (since it's mainly due to the LBO) leads to high $ amount of interest and also a higher EV

My thoughts were to look at a more normal year (they are targeting 3x net debt/ebitda) so I'm looking at 2016. I'll calculate FCFE (EBITDA - int - working cap - capex) and then discount (10%) back to today. Then look at a FCFE Yield

-I have my assumed revenue growth and also EBITDA margins increasing each year 
-working cap/capex keeping constant as % of rev (these are both minimal)
-then total FCFE is used to pay down debt. So total FCFE in 2014 of $300m is used to pay down debt. This is how I calculate 2015 interest expense. 1) lower debt balance 2) I brought down the interest rate slightly each year since they are paying down/refinancing 

There are a lot of assumptions, so I'm trying to lean on the conservative side. I'm more interested in, does the above thought process sounds okay?

t3_2a1buf,A Look at Davita and Fresenius,"So I'm pretty sure most people are aware that Berkshire owns shares in Davita through Ted Weschler's portfolio and that he has personally had shares in Davita for the greater part of the last decade. However I'm curious as to whether Davita is that much better when compared to its peers and in particular, Fresenius.

According to both companies, if we are to look at their North American dialysis operations: Davita's revenue per treatment is currently $340 and their cost per treatment is $274 leading to operating profit of $66. Fresenius makes $359 per treatment at a cost of $293 also leading to a operating profit of $66. So they both do seem equal operating wise. Though if if you work it out from revenue, operating income and number of patients then Davita has a revenue per patient of $334, cost of $282 and operating profit of $52 while Fresenius has revenue per patient of $384, cost of $319, operating profit $65. So on this basis, Fresenius seems to be doing better. I'm also aware that both get majority of their profits from privately insured patients and don't really make much on government insured patients.

Both companies have similar numbers of patients in the US, with Fresenius slightly higher at 25m and Davita at 23m. Fresenius also has slightly better operating margins in this region at 16% while Davita has 15%.

Much has been said about Davita's recent acquisition of HCP and the earnings they will be getting from that division. However Fresenius also has their own hospital operations division and I think they are currently the largest private owner of hospitals in Germany. And Fresenius recently added to theirs by buying more hospitals from Rhon Klinikum last year which should add to revenue and earnings in 2014. Their hospital operations are pretty identical operation wise, with Davita having revenue of 3.2bn and an operating margin of 12% from HCP while Fresenius makes 3.4bn with an operating margin of 11.5%.

Moving away from North American dialysis operations, Fresenius is also one of the worlds biggest makers of dialysis equipment and Davita actually buys some of their dialyzers from Fresenius, their medical equipment division also makes drugs and clinical nutrition and it has generally averaged around 20% in operating margins. Fresenius also has fairly large dialysis operations in Latin America and Asia that each bring in close to 1bn in revenue and Europe as well which brings in around 3bn, whereas Davita is primarily focused on North America. 

I think most people can agree that the dialysis industry is going to be growing over the coming years, there's little question about that when you look at the number of people with obesity, heart and renal problems. In addition to that, it's a necessary service you can't choose to just skimp out on your weekly dialysis treatments unless you want to die and there's still plenty of growth to be had in the emerging markets.

So while maybe five to ten years ago Davita may have been the better bet. Is it really a much better company than Fresenius at this point and going forward?

t3_2a3ohq,Ackman returned 25% in the first half. How much of that gain would you guess is from Allergan and what would you guess is his theta burn on the position per day?,"I thought this would be a fun exercise in option pricing. Clearly, Ackman booked a huge gain on the day of the Valeant offer announcement and has slowly been losing money to theta, or time value, burn. He would not have offered to take less cash and Valeant shares in the event of a deal if this weren't the case.

Ackman is typically aggressive. He buys OTC options in bulk when he wants to open new positions quickly. Considering the cash outlay that would have been required for an in the money or at the money position with enough theta to give him breathing room on the takeover, the options were likely out of the money at the time of purchase. He also didn't spend a lot on vol because Allergan is low beta: one of the many reasons this was a good deal for Ackman if his due diligence on Valeant is correct.

He knew the sweet spot for the strike because he had a very good idea of the offering price and low beta too, so if you're gonna spend on pricing, then spend on theta. Even then, how long would he give himself? Twelve months? Around 180 days to expiration, you would have to bear some considerable pain. Around 90 days, you could be burning maybe $10 million per day?

Ballpark numbers: $130 average for the underlying. 20% IV for far out of the money. $160 strike. Essentially no divvy. 240k contracts to get around $4B...

Looks to be around $2.50-$3.50 per contract, average to $3.00... that's only $72mm. This deal has some juice... but less than I thought it would honestly. An IV of 8% and 270 days to expiry spits out around $8.00 per contract, so currently still $120mm in the money if he went about it this way, but PS has probably lost money from theta burn and a drop in IV as the excitement dies down and merger arbitrage players make their decisions on how to play it.

Or would he choose more cash outlay because its a surer thing? That would increase his downside if the deal doesn't go through and you would get less $ for $ because of less imbedded leverage.

Thoughts?

For debt, it simply has a higher yield relative to say, U.S. risk free.  But for equity, when I play around with the CAPM model, I get the following:

**Rf=10%, Rm=20%, Beta=2**   ==>   10% + 2(20%-10%) = *30%*

**Rf=15%, Rm=20%, Beta=2**   ==>   15% + 2(20%-15%) = *25%*

**Background:** 

Altisource Portfolio solutions ""Altisource"" was spun off from Ocwen Financial in 2009. Ocwen financial is a mortgage servicer. Of all the mortgage servicers, Ocwen is the most cost efficient, best run, and best capitalized. As a mortgage servicer, Ocwen acquires mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Owners of MSRs collect a small fee from every mortgage payment it is servicing. Ocwen may service a mortgage by handling day to day tasks of servicing a loan, process payments, keep track of principal and interest paid, manages escrow accounts, initiate foreclosure, modify loan payments for subprime and delinquent loans and so on. 

The reason Altisource was spun off from Ocwen in 2009 is because Ocwen's Chairman Bill Erbey knew the software division of Ocwen was not being valued properly within the business. Altisource is now incorporated in Luxembourg for tax reasons but it basically does everything a United States company would do. It files with the SEC, gets audited and does almost all business in the United States. 

**Thesis:**

**What does Altisource do?**

From the 2013 10k-

 ""Altisource®, together with its subsidiaries, is a premier marketplace and transaction solutions provider for the real estate, mortgage and consumer debt industries offering both distribution and content. We leverage proprietary business process, vendor and electronic payment management software and behavioral science based analytics to improve outcomes for marketplace participants.""

If you figured out what they did from reading that, congratulations, because I couldn't. I own the company and I still do not know all of the services they provide. What I do know is that more than half of Altisource's revenue is derived from Ocwen. Ocwen uses Altiosurce's state of the art servicing technology to service their loans. Altisource's technology allows Ocwen to be such a low-cost servicer. Altisource only provides their technology to Ocwen and no other servicers. 

http://oraclefromomaha.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/1.png 

In the above link, you can see the ways Altisource generates revenue. The main thing to know here is that Altisource generates a huge portion of their revenue from Ocwen. When Ocwen makes less modifications on loans, they use Altisource's services less so Altisource makes less money. When Ocwen modifies more loans then Altisource makes more money because Ocwen uses their serivices more. It provides a hedge against parts of their business that may struggle in a recession like any other business. During the natural economic cycle if there is a recession and Ocwen is modifying more loans because more homeowners cannot make payments then Altisource is making more money than they would during good economic times because Ocwen uses their services more. The more MSRs Ocwen acquires, the more Altisource makes. 

**Ocwen's growth (basically a quick long thesis on Ocwen)**

When a bank loans money to an individual to buy a house, a mortgage is originated and an MSR is created. The bank then keeps the mortgage on its books or sells the mortgage to another entity. Perhaps Fannie or Freddie. But what happens to the MSR? The MSR is then sold to a servicer such as Nationstar, Walter Investment Management Corp, or Ocwen. The reason the banks or originator of the mortgage sell the MSR is because they cannot service it properly and/or they would lose money in the process of trying to service it. Because of Dodd Frank, banks are trying to get MSRs off their books even faster because they cannot service them efficiently as previously mentioned and because they will have to hold 250% more capital against the MSRs. All banks are moving away from owning MSRs and non-bank servicing is becoming a larger industry, and Ocwen is leading the way. Due to the high supply of MSRs that are wanting to be sold by banks the MSRs can currently be bought at a 20-30% yield. Ocwen can buy the most MSRs because they are the best capitalized and they use the most conservative balance sheet. Ocwen being the lowest cost operator provides them with a huge competitive advantage when bidding for MSRs as well. Ocwen will continue to lead the non-bank servicers in buying MSRs. Ocwen currently has $464 billion of unpaid principle balance of loans they are servicing and another trillion dollars of subprime (Ocwen specializes in subprime) UPB is expected to get into the hands of non bank servicers by 2018 (3-4 trillion in UPB of regular MSRs). Ocwen will get the most of that trillion dollars of UPB of any servicer because of their competitive advantages. 

Another competitive advantage of Ocwen is their relationship Home Loan Servicing Solutions Ltd. HLSS was also created by Bill Erbey. HLSS provides the capital for Ocwen to service loans so Ocwen does not have to tie up their capital. In the future, HLSS will acquire more loans and allow Ocwen to sub-service them through a unique financing strategy. This strategy called the accretion model is a genius way to get capital for HLSS to afford a virtually unlimited amount of MSRs. HLSS pays a huge dividend and because of this dividend, HLSS trades above its tangible book value due to fixed income hungry investors who want a fat dividend. HLSS then issues more shares above tangible book value to then acquire more MSRs. Issuing shares above book value actually creates value for HLSS shareholders also instead of diluting value as many people would think issuing shares does. Those MSRs are then sub-serviced by Ocwen, who still uses Altisource's technology. 

Ocwen is also getting into foreword and reverse mortgage origination so they can have a constant stream of MSRs.

Basically, Ocwen and HLSS are going to acquire more MSRs and Ocwen will be servicing more mortgages. More mortgages serviced by Ocwen = more revenue for altisource. 

All MSR transactions have currently been stopped by a New York financial regulator but we will get to that issue later.

**Share Repurchases**

Up until a few months ago the laws of Luxembourg restricted the amount of shares that Altisource could repurchase. Altisource recently created a foreign subsidiary that does nothing called ""MidCo"" to hold all other parts of the business so there would legally be no restrictions on share repurchases. Until Altisource did this, they were repurchasing the maximum amount of shares that Luxembourg would allow. 

Here is Altisource's entity structure to bypass Luxembourg share repurchase laws http://i.imgur.com/J6LPEc0.jpg

The highlighted dark blue entity will be the entity repurchasing unlimited shares because MidCo, its parent company is not in Luxembourg. How smart is that. 

Altisource currently authorized the repurchase of up to 2.9 million shares. 2.9 million shares is 13% of their market cap. They could easily repurchase that amount. Altisource also just finalized a loan with BAC for $200 million to repurchase shares so the share repurchases will really start to kick into high gear with the new liquidity and cheaper price. Up until the sharp share price drop, Altisource was repurchasing for the past several months around $110. That shows the board and management think the company is undervalued at $110 and now it is at $84 and nothing fundamentally changed about the company. 

**Insider Purchases**

During the past 6 months, 3 insiders have purchased at $102, $103, $106, and $120. Between 20% and 43% above current market prices. Bill Erbey also owns 30% of Altisource and 13% of Ocwen. His views are directly in line with other shareholders.

**Bill Erbey and his Capital Allocation**

Bill Erbey is the Chairman of Ocwen, Altisource Portfolio Solutions, Altisource Asset Management Corporation, Altisource Residential, and Home Loan Servicing Solutions. Bill has done a great job of creating shareholder value for Ocwen and Altisource shareholders. Bill has also greatly benefited from this because of his stakes in thise companies. Before the sharp share price drop due to outside forces, Bill compounded Ocwen's stock at 30% per year since 2002 WITHOUT including the Altisource spinoff which compounded itself since 2009 at almost 75% a year. Altisource then spunoff Altisource Residential and Altisource Asset Management. Every spinoff is a value creating machine. At one point AAMC had compounded 430% in a year and a half, although it was due to a stretched valuation. Bill is dedicated to doing whatever it takes to create shareholder value. He relocated to the Virgin Islands just to save Ocwen some money on taxes. 

I once read a story about Bill in his Virgin Islands home and his electric bill for the air conditioning. Keep in mind, Mr. Erbey is a multi billionaire. Bill got his electric bill and saw his costs had skyrocketed due to his air conditioning. Bill then sat there after that baking and sweating in the heat in his home so he could save a couple thousand on his electricity bill. He will do anything to save a dollar. 

**Hubzu**

Hubzu is owned by Altisource. Hubzu is currently an online marketplace to buy and sell foreclosed homes. Like Zillow and Trulia but for foreclosed homes. Hubzu takes foreclosed homes from Ocwen and lists them on their website Hubzu.com. Hubzu is trying to get into the non-distressed house listing like other real estate websites like Zillow and Trulia. This will grow Hubzu at an even faster rate. Altisource states Hubzu gets about 1 million unique new visitors per month. When you buy Altisource you are also buying the jewel of Hubzu. Bill Erbey claims that Hubzu makes ""as much money in one quarter as Zillow does in 4 quarters"" Zillow has a market capitalization of $5 billion. Zillow's market capitalization is definitely stretched but a spinoff would create a lot of shareholder value even if the market gave Hubzu a fraction of Zillow's valuation. 

**Why is the company undervalued?**

All this greatness in one company so why is it so undervalued? Remember how Altisource's earning were pretty much directly tied to how well Ocwen does? A New York State Financial Department regulator named Benjamin Lawsky halted a $2.7 bilion ($39 billion in UPB) Wells Fargo MSR transfer to Ocwen. This also halted all of the other MSR transactions between banks and servicers. Benjamin Lawsky is probing into Ocwen and other servicers. He states that he wants to make sure Ocwen and other servicers have the capacity to service loans efficiently because they are ""growing too fast"". The relationships these 5 companies share though is somewhat sketchy. They have a lot of the same board members and they all work with each other and make money off each other. Ocwen is the best servicer of them all though. They provide more loan modifications than anyone else and they have the lowest re default rate. 

A slide from an investor presentation shows how they compare to others http://i.imgur.com/YkIKD2O.png

Even if Lawsky did find that some servicers do not have the capacity to service loans then Ocwen would be the last one in question because it is easy to see they are doing the best for their consumer compared to anyone other servicer. 

Benjamin Lawsky is doing this for his own political reasons. He wants his name on the news. He wants people to see his name. Perhaps he wants to run for governor or something. Why would he schedule an interview with CNBC about the probe into the mortgage servicers right after it is announced. Why would he send a letter to Altisource and at the same time send it to the press, therefore ruining Altisource's reputation without giving them a chance to respond. He is also really into regulating bitcoin in New York which is just another vehicle to get his name in the news. 

There are very recent updates with the regulatory pressure and basically the probing is narrowed down to an issue with force placed insurance and Altisource. Ben Lawsky could not find anything else. He sent this letter on Aug. 4th to Ocwen. So this is what the probe is narrowed down to.  

http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press2014/pr140804-ocwen-letter.pdf

Basically, if a homeowner is struggling to make payments and can't pay their insurance, Ocwen has the right to force place insurance into their payments so the mortgage owner does not incur massive losses if a catastrophe happens. Ocwen has to outsource whoever force places the insurance and the issue that Ben Lawsky was worried about was why Altisource was appointed to find someone to force place that insurance, why Altisource received commission for basically doing nothing, and why Bill Erbey did not consult with any of the Ocwen board before making this decision to allow Altisource to find an insurer. 

Altisource will probably get a one time fine settlement and they will go on doing business as usual. I believe this because an almost identical situation happened with Assurant and the New York State Financial Department and they settled for $14 million. There is also an interview on CNBC with someone who talks to the CEO of Ocwen and they are sure that Ocwen and Altisource will just settle with a deal with Lawsky and that will be the end of it. 

Interview: 

http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000298804

**Risks**
Benjamin Lawsky actually finds something else that Altisource was doing wrong. 
Bill Erbey Dies. He is in his 60s and overweight.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion Altisource is extremely cheap. Remember that quote about not knowing how much a man weighs but knowing he is fat? That is the case with Altisource. Altisource is definitely undervalued but there are a range of possibilities of the valuation with Hubzu, regulatory matters, growth, etc.

[Link to the research report](https://mega.co.nz/#!tVgX1BzC!PggH-ZM3Me5OE9rOkedx_LxQPxBA_CM1u7950hnCZZQ)

Easyhome operates 2 business lines: 

1) Leasing: rent to own furniture and electronics, 18% operating margin, expected to grow to low 20s%. Majority of the revenue

2) Financing: recently launched, unsecured loans in the $1k to $5k (for borrowers with credit thats not good enough for banks, but they are not desperate enough for pay-day loans). Operating margin in the low 30%, loan book currently growing 65% YoY. Financing is expected to help boost overall operating margins to mid-high 20%.

EH has very low debt. They recently secured a $200mm debt package (~40% Debt to total assets), which will help boost growth. 

The story is very compelling. The mezz debt market in Canada is small and the US banks abandoned their Canadian operations in 2008/2009 (i.e. Citi, Wells Fargo), thus leaving only EH to supply an underserved market. He doesnt think the Big 5 Canadian will enter the market due to the risk and strict capital requirements.

Valuation wise, we are looking at 18x P/E LTM vs peer 19.6x P/E. It's even cheaper for forward valuation (10x vs 21x peer).

If EH can successfully execute the expansion of easyfinancial and grow dividends/buybacks, the stock will have no problem getting to the $30s. 

The analyst drew parallels to Dollarama (the dominant Canadian dollar store). Dollarama had 0 debt, low dividends, high growth. Then the stock really popped when they started buying back shares and increasing dividends, went from $60 to $90 in a couple of months.

I'm super excited about what I'm learning, but I have almost no one to discuss my ideas with. I have a background in programming, and I'm beginning to write my own software to test my hypotheses. So far I've read the following books:

* The Bogleheads Guide to Investment
* The Intelligent Investor
* Security Analysis
* The Little that Beats the Market
* The Big Secret for the Small Investor
* Irrational Exuberance
* The Most Important Thing

I am comparing my investment performance against the S&P 500, but I was surprised to see different values for period performance.

t3_2ffo15,Bank switch thesis BMO v. BAC,"Hi SA,

Referencing Graham's suggestion that head to head security analysis can sometimes yield more conclusive results than analyzing any individual security, I'm contemplating switching from BMO to BAC. 

I like to keep things simple. My reason would be to move to a security with a lower price to tangible book value. By my canculation, tangible book/share for BMO=41.64, for BAC 10.34 (MRQ). P/TB of 2.04 for BMO, 1.55 for BAC.

Implicit in my thesis is that large banks tend to invest in similar asset classes and offer similar services, suggesting that their future returns measured as returns on equity will likely be similar. Since 2008 US banks seem to have moved in a more conservative direction similar to Can banks. It then seems to follow that switching to a security which offers more equity/$ makes sense.

t3_2gmll2,Long Thesis for BBRY,"Blackberry is a provider of software, services and hardware primarily  targeted at enterprise clients. Market share has declined drastically  since the entrance of AAPL and GOOG into the space, and the Blackberry  OS has crumbled as an ecosystem. Lack of apps meant less users, which  discouraged developers from making apps, creating a vicious cycle. John  Chen, who turned around Sybase, replaced Thorsten Heins on November 4,  2013. Using a sum of the parts analysis, we value BBRY at around $12.7  bn, or $24/share, which represents a 130% upside from current prices.

We  believe that the hardware segment is worth around $1.9 bn. Losses were  severe for 2013, but inventory write offs meant substantially lower than  normal gross margins for the year. We believe that it is likely that,  with better inventory management, the results were one off and  non-recurring. Management has decided to partner with Foxconn to cut  costs, and focus more on niche areas like healthcare with their new  phones (the Passport). As of Q1 2014 margins have already shown drastic  improvement. We believe there is a potential for turnaround for the  hardware segment, at least to profitability. Motorola sold to Lenovo for  $3bn, which was 3x sales. Nokia sold their headset segment to Microsoft  for around $7 bn, which was around 0.5-1x sales. To be conservative, we  will apply the lower end of that range to 2013 sales which comes to  $1.9bn. We believe that BBRY hardware is worth at least that much to a  private buyer.

BBM has become a very valuable asset. Whilst the  number of users have decreased from around 200 mn at its peak to just 80  mn now, Blackberry is looking to turn this business around by releasing  BBM on iOS and Android. Social media and messaging apps are generally  valued by the number of users they have, and how valuable each user is.  The Whatsapp acquisition valued each user at around $40, whilst the  Viber acquisition valued each user at $8. It is important to note that  scale matters a lot for a messaging app, thus each user on Whatsapp, the  market leader, is valued at substantially higher prices than users on  competing apps. BBM is not a market leader, but the user base does  comprise of working professionals and government officials, which may be  worth more than each user on an app like Whatsapp or Viber. The prime  selling proposition for BBM is the fact that it is hosted by its own  network and so is secure and does not require a data plan for it to  function. To be conservative, we will take the lower end ($8) and  multiply by the number of users which is 80 mn, which comes to around  $630 mn, although we believe that it is potentially worth a lot more.

BES  and Services is the new focus of the company. It competes with IBM,  VMWare, Good and Mobile Iron amongst others in a highly fragmented and  competitive space. Whilst competitors are abundant, Blackberry is the  clear market leader with more customers than the closest 3 competitors  combined. BES and Services provides solutions and security for companies  and governments to manage employees’ mobile devices and apps. As  smartphones become more prevalent, this business will continue to grow.  Previously, services for Android and iOS users were lacking, but  Blackberry is looking to solve this issue with the release of BES 12.  John Chen has a background in enterprise, and we are very confident of  his leadership going forward.

No direct comps but start-ups in  the same industry have been acquired (AirWatch) or have IPO'd  (MobileIron) at 5+ x sales. Looking at 2013 figures, sales for the  segment comes to around 3 bn, and COGS at around 400 mn. Gross profit  for the segment comes to around 2.3 bn. We will apply a conservative 4x  multiple on gross profit, valuing this segment at $9 bn.

The  software segment is primarily composed of QNX. QNX was acquired by  Blackberry in 2009 for 200 mn. Currently it is primarily used in  automobiles but has been touted for use in a wide variety of industries  and situations including surgery (healthcare) and space travel. It is at  the heart of Blackberry’s venture into the internet of things, which  can be seen as a moon-shot (like many start ups), and as an option.

Revenue  for 2013 comes to around $200 mn. Considering the progress that has  been made in the past few years, and its potential, we cannot see QNX  being sold for anything less than $200 mn.

Last but not least, we  value BBRY’s patents at around $1 bn. In 2011 Apple, Microsoft,  BlackBerry, EMC, Ericsson, and Sony formed the “Rockstar” group to  purchase Nortel’s 6,000 patent portfolio for $4.5B or roughly $750K per  patent. The high price was undoubtedly due to market conditions at the  time. Blackberry has not monetized its patents to any great extent,  although Huawei has settled. Some sources cite Blackberry’s patents as  being worth $2 bn (The Numbers Behind BlackBerry’s Patent Goldmine -  Corporate Intelligence – WSJ), although we doubt it will ever be sold  for that much. We believe that $1 bn is a realistic estimate of the  portfolio’s true worth, which includes BBRY’s own patents.

In  conclusion we believe that BBRY can be very conservatively valued at  $12.7 bn. John Chen and management has already shown signs of turning  around the company after Q1 numbers were released. We believe the  company is being undervalued by the market due to a fundamental  understanding of what its main business is. The market believes that  BBRY is about its devices which in fact it is the BES segment which is  generating the bulk of its cash flow. John Chen has shown us a deep  understanding of the enterprise market, and we are very optimistic about  Blackberry’s outlook going forward.",5,0.62,1410924637.0

t3_2hjfz4,Aviation Industry / Airline Analysis / Copa Holdings,"I've been looking into Copa Holdings (CPA) for the last coulpe of weeks. 

CPA is a Panama based airline founded in 1947 and taken public in 2005. It is a leader in passenger and cargo airline service in Latin America. The company operates out of Panama City, location of its Hub of the Americas, and transports passengers across the entire continent with 280 daily flights. As of the close of Q2 2014, CPA operated a fleet of 93 aircraft, including 67 Boeing 737-Next Generation aircraft and 26 Embraer 190 aircraft. Its destinations range as far north as Montreal, Canada and as far south as Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pedro Heilbron (54 years old) has led the company since 1988, making him one of the longest tenured CEOs in the industry. CPA has had consistent earnings growth throughout the last 10 years. It is an industry leader in operational efficiency and punctuality (recent quarter on-time performance of 89.5% and a flight-completion factor of 99.8%). The company benefits from a several moats, including the location of its hub (Panama City is perfectly positioned at the midpoint of the Americas). CPA uses up almost 80% of the capacity in Tocumen International Airport, which is undergoing a substantial expansion set to be completed in 2016. The company's fleet is scheduled to grow in capacity at a 9% yearly rate in the next two years.

CPA's stock has suffered recently in light of its Venezuela troubles. A significant amount of CPA's cash (roughly $528MM out of a $1,150MM total) is trapped in Venezuela. The funds are subject to exchange controls in Venezuela and are pending repatriation. The political and economic instability has also forced the company to cut its capacity in the country in roughly 50%. Venzuela was CPA's most lucrative market in terms of margin. The issue, however, does not appear to present a liquidity problem for the airline. Added to this, there are fears that a similar situation could be cooking up in Argentina, though management assures the necessary precautions are being taken. 

I've never conducted a detailed analysis of an airline before, and I'm well aware that the industry has been demonized by value investors, including Buffet (""Investors have poured their money into airlines and airline manufacturers for 100 years with terrible results"").

Still, it feels as though this is a high quality business trading cheaply at a 9.15 PE, considering its solid track record, moat, and near term growth plans. Perhaps the Venezuela issues have caused the stock to be oversold.

Can anyone offer any advice on what to look for when analyzing an airline? Any valuable resources? Would you stay away from airlines regardless of the circumstances?",3,0.72,1411748841.0

t3_2jvr2y,Let's take a look at Prosafe (my first analysis) [xpost from r/investing],"**Introduction**

Prosafe is a provider of semi-submersible accomodation vessels (refered to as SSAVs). These SSAVs are used in the offshore industry when big tasks require the crews to stay at sea for longer periods or when additional persons are required for a task. Prosafe owns 11 high quality SSAVs out of a global fleet of only 20 SSAVs making Prosafe the biggest player in the market. Prosafe is in the process of building several new SSAVs. 

 Prosafe is headquartered in Cyprus but listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker ""PRS"". 

Before I continue with the analysis I have a word for the readers. This is my first published analysis and English is not my first language therefore you have to expect some grammatical mistakes. Please bear with me. Since I'm a novice security analyst, I hope that you will provide some constructive feedback or advices to my ongoing journey of becoming an expert security analyst. Everything from suggesting books that I should read to raising question about the analysis is very welcome. With that said. Let's begin. 

**The numbers**

Looking at the numbers we see a solid company. Good earnings, high solvency, high margins and so forth. We also see low valuation metrics indicating that the company might be undervalued. It certainly looks undervalued to me. 

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/W1Oh2sT.png)

Insiders, including the CEO and CFO, have acquired shares in the last couple of months which supports my belief that the company is undervalued at the current price.

**Dividend**

Prosafe's dividend policy is very shareholder friendly. They aim to pay out up to 75% of net income. At the current market price Prosafe yields ~11%. This yield is very nice for the dividend minded investor, but keep in mind that the dividend might get a cut in the future either due to lower earnings (see the risk section) or because additional capital is needed for the current process of building more SSAVs. 

 The image below provides a historical overview of the dividend (in norwegian kroner - NOK) and the payout ratio.  

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/GVytGUa.png)

**Prosafe and the price of oil**

Because Prosafe operates in the oil business I suspected a link between the price of oil and the shareprice. I decided to take a look at the relationship between the two (see the picture below).

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/nLRggQ3.png)

As you can see they are closely related and the recent drop in the price of oil is the main reason why Prosafe's share price has dropped 30% from 3 month high. The earnings also share some degree of sensitivity to oil price. The earnings are not as sensitive as the share price because Prosafe rents out the SSAVs on long term contracts. 

**Catalysts**

The share price, and to some degree the earnings, are closely linked to the price of oil. This implies that a higher oil price (say, 100$/barrel) would without a doubt push the share price up. Probably a lot. This makes an investment in Prosafe a play on oil.

Prosafe has historically traded in a band between P/E5 and P/E12 (as illustrated in the image below) and is nearing the lower band. I expect that higher oil prices would revalue the share at around P/E8 to P/E10. The analyst estimates for next years earnings are 7,2 NOK (1.1$ optained via 4-trader.com times the current USDNOK of 6,56) per share which - combined with a revaluation due to higher oil price - should push the share price to around 57,6 - 72 NOK. An upside of 67%-108%.

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/9W58DFN.png)

**Risks**

By investing in Prosafe you're going to face two major risks which can hurt earnings in the coming years.

1) The oil price stays at the current level or falls further.

2) The demand for SSAVs falls drastically due to new supply in the next three years. Over the next two-three years the global supply of SSAVs is going to increase by ~60%. Prosafe is the biggest player in the market and has a clear competitive advantage but is probably still going to suffer to some degree from this increase in supply. 

**Summary and closing word**

Prosafe's fat yield combined with the solid earnings history and strong financial position is hard to come by. There are however several risks in the coming time. Lower oil prices and/or the increased demand of SSAVs can hurt earnings and yield during the next couple of years and push the share price even lower than it is today. 

Given their strong financial position, their economics of scale and competitive advantage I have no doubt that Prosafe will weather the coming demand storm and continue as a succesful company (with a substanially higher share price).

t3_2khhje,DCF Analysis - Need a bit of help.,"So recently I was lucky in receiving an interview for a firm, and they asked me to pitch a stock. Realized I had a fairly hard time justifying my case with simply qualitative analysis and looking at key ratios and figured this would be the best place for me to ask questions. I only have a few days to submit this as well, and having relatively no finance background has me scrambling all over the place for answers.

Stock I picked is a semiconductor company, with relatively high growth, but trailing P/E, P/S does not seem too convincing. Analysts for some reason or another though, rate it a strong buy.

1. Trailing P/E is currently 3x of Forward P/E, what could possibly be the reasons for that? Is it simply that earnings are to increase 3x if price were to stay stable? Which P/E is the proper valuation ratio to use?

2. I've watched quite a few videos and read a few things on how to construct a DCF model. It seems that earning per share, and FCFF are used to predict future cash flows. I'm looking at the company's financial records and while Revenues have been consistently been increasing from quarter to quarter, cash flows have not been stably growing quarter to quarter (although they have been increasing YtoY so far). How do I predict future growth given that?

3. Just in general, anything else I should know when constructing a simple DCF model? What to avoid doing, common mistakes, things to highlight in regards to sensitivity tables (esp. how to calculate discount rates).

Sorry for this long post, just trying to jam everything in my head as it is under the time pressure and I realize I may sound a bit stupid. If anyone could volunteer to help me with this, I'd really appreciate it!

t3_2krsh0,Analysis for Engineering Informatica: An uncovered deep value theory for a stock that has suffered from a technical overhang and negative market sentiment surrounding Italian IT firms,"Hi, I am just starting my career as a sell side analyst and I have spend the last few weeks working on the buy case for a company called Engineering Informatica Spa. This is not a finished version of my anayslis and the valuation is not included. I am calling the company tomorow to ask questions on revenue streams and cost structure to get a better idea of the sustainability or margins. Please let me know where the anayliss could be improved and what you think of it, taking into account this is my first ever write up. 


A company with high and improving returns on tangible capital (17.2% 2013 to 21.8% 2014), driven by increasing Earnings margins and decreasing capital requirements, is trading at distressed multiples, 5.8x 2014 Ev/Ebit due to market pressure and a technical overhang. The Engineering investment case is becoming a very attractive deep value trade with potential upsides of 50% and low risks. 
  
Background and Sector specifics

Engineering is a major Italian information technology group which provides services such as software solutions, IT infrastructure, and business expertise on a global level (although 85% of its revenues are still derived in Italy). The group is organized around four main market divisions: PA (government) and Healthcare (31.7%), Utilities and Telco (28.9%), Industries & Services (22.2%), and Finance (17.3%). The company has a market cap of 520m euros, employs over 7,200 employees and achieved revenues of 823m in 2013(6.9% YoY growth) a 6.6% EBIT margin.
 
 
ENG has 3 main revenue streams: System Integration & Consulting, Outsourcing, and Proprietary licences and fees.

System Integration & Consulting

Characterised by contracts lasting less than one year, focus on providing IT services on enterprise content management (content, workflow and knowledge management). They also consult in areas such as organisation governance and people management. These areas of revenue offer higher profitability compared to outsourcing contracts due to the higher value of service provided and the nature of the price structure (turn-key contracts).

Outsourcing, Application Management, and Cloud Services		
Managed Operations Department provides clients with a full offering of Outsourcing Services thanks to a highly Technological Centre located in Pont Saint Martin. IT infrastructure is also based on Torino, Padua, Milan, Vicenza and Rome sites. Despite lower profitability in this area, outsourcing guarantees more visibility thanks to longer contracts (5-7 years) and c80% of contract value is made of a fixed amount. Outsourcing is anti-cyclical: in economic downturns and firms need to further improve their cost structure, they prefer to outsource IT services or computerize manual processes. 

Proprietary licences and fees 

ENG can rely on more than 200 proprietary solutions spanning from a CRM suite for utilities to compliance and governance software for banks. The offer of proprietary software is characterized by high profitability and strong customer retention (high barrier to entry depending on whether the software is recognised as market leader).
 
The market ENG operates in is concentrated around 5 players (IBM, Accenture, HP, Microsoft, Engineering) counting for a combined market share of nearly 42%. It is important to note that in an economic downturn firms tend to cut IT spending first. Thus, the Italian ICT market has seen a reduction in consumer spending since 2007. However after 7 years of market decline, Assinform forecasts an increase in overall spending by 0.6% in 2014.  Engineering claims that it has benefited from sector decline as it grabbed a larger relevant market share, up around 300bps to 11.5%.
ENG is a services company, 91% of its costs are made up of Personnel costs and the cost paid to 3rd party suppliers. Due to the heavy variable cost structure, the ability to improve margins is mostly derived through increasing labour productivity and efficiency, as well as reducing prices paid to suppliers. The business is also slightly seasonal; the first half of the year consists of around 48% of revenues. Typically, increases/decreases in spending see a delay of 6/12 months to GDP changes due to the nature and length of an IT project.

The Opportunity

Negative market sentiment in Europe seems to have influenced ENG’s price:  since its peak in April €54 the stock has dropped by 31% to €37, trading at 10.6x 2014 P/E. Yet the company fundamentals have stayed consistent over this period. Q1 results were weak (Ebit down 20% yoy to €10m) and the price drop might have reflected this. However, these results were in line with management expectations, taking into consideration the integration process of the company Engineering.mo (ex T-Systems Italia) and the consolidation of the newly-acquired company MHT. We can safely say there were no fundamental issues. In the meantime we have seen a recovery of margins, top line growth and a positive net financial position. Results in H1 are reflective of a solid business with potential to benefit from international expansion, or a share buyback with the cash that has been generated. Top line growth was 3% yoy, Ebit grew 7.6% to €33.9m and Ebit margins also improved by 50bps to 8.6%. Improvements in Public Administration payment times led to an increase in the net financial position by 15.9% to €45.2m.
Engineering stock is artificially depressed: On top of the overbearing market forces, we are expecting Bestinver to sell its 10% stake in Engineering after the departure of Francisco Garcia Parames as fund manager. Bestinver is facing 5billion euros in redutions to its AUM and will most likely begin to sell off its positions to liquidate. Market reaction to this news has led to further de-rating of the stock as people anticipate the selloff.  

Margins: Are they sustainable?

Given its capital returns (21.8%), operating history (12.3% CAGR 2000-2013) and international growth prospects, Engineering’s current valuation is only justifiable if (1) margins begin to fall off or (2) large amounts of receivables are written off. In the first case we would be looking at future increases in costs and/or severe deflation in the prices clients pay for the services ENG provides. This would also suggest ENG loses pricing power in its market. Second, Engineering holds a large amount of receivables on its books (€552m as of H1 2014). The risk here is that clients default on the debt owed and Engineering is forced to write off large proportions of its balance sheet. In this section we will explain why these 2 main risks are not significant enough to make up for the recent movements in the stock price. 


Trade Receivables risk

At face value the Trade Receivables situation that Engineering is facing does not look good. I would definitely consider this the biggest risk the company faces in the next 2-3 years. The Group claims that the type of operations justifies the high amount of receivables, such as the proportion due from the public administration, contractual durations. Trade receivables are all due within 12 months. However, the biggest issue here is the amount of receivables that are overdue. These have increased by 37.6% to €265m. Moreover, almost 30% of receivables are overdue by 120 days meaning the debtor hasn’t paid in 16 months. Yet most of the increase in overdue receivables has come from doing business with the Italian government. The Group has indicated that government bodies often do not respect the conditions established by contracts, but this does not result in irrecoverable receivables. In other words, even though the government is extremely slow at paying Engineering, they do not expect the debt to be defaulted.
The problem of overdue receivables is reflected in the dispute with the Region of Sicily over almost €100m, which has been ongoing for over 2 years.  After speaking to management about the problem they have emphasised that they are confident they will be paid. Their auditors are not in the condition to ask Engineering to write off the credit, implying a high grade of confidence in getting payment back. Another notable positive: there are expected future improvements to payments terms from Public Administration due to the European Late Payment Directive; imposing members of the EU to pay their private suppliers within 60 days. These changes would lead to further cash flow improvements.

Benefits from a positive NFP

Since ENG is cash positive (45.2m, 16% yoy increase) the options for share buy backs, increase in dividends and also growth through international acquisitions are all likely. In 2014 we are expecting a 7.6 cents dividend payout, which has increased from 6.5 cents in 2013. In addition, management has clearly mentioned that “we are plainly aware of the under-evaluation of our company meaning we can invest some of our cash in buying back shares”. The half year report has confirmed that the shareholders have voted in favour of a share repurchase plan for a maximum of 2.5m shares, within a maximum time frame of 18 months.  Engineering has 12.5m outstanding shares, so the share buyback policy could lead to 20% of shares being repurchased. This is a highly significant figure, and it is great news to know the company is this confident that the shares are undervalued. Once the company begins to repurchase shares, this should further restore market confidence. The belief that the stock is undervalued is certainly prevalent within the company. Chairman Michele Cinaglia has recently engaged in buying over €800,000 of shares over the months of August and September using his personal wealth. 
Management says they are evaluating investments abroad, which so far have proved to be the strongest sources of growth, and are convinced that geographical expansion will be one of the key points of success.

t3_2mhqhc,Analysis of a norwegian medical equipment supplier,"Medistim. Ticker MEDI @ Oslo stock exchange

The business:

The Norwegian company Medistim is in the business of developing, servicing, leasing and distributing medical devices. It specializes in technology for measuring blood flow, typically during heart surgery.
 
The main products are the VeriQ and the VeriQC. They also have a new machine called the MeriQ, but it is not yet approved in all markets, so it will not have much influence on this analysis.
These devices use ultrasound probes to precisely measure blood flow through blood vessels ensuring quality during surgery and giving the surgeon enhanced precision. This correlates positively with reduced chances for complications during and after surgery.
The company’s latest machine, the VeriQC, combines this technology with ultrasound imaging, further enhancing the functionality for the surgeons. According to the company, this is the only device in the market with this technology.
the technology can also be useful for other procedures, like organ transplants, and locating stenosis in blood veins (stenosis is a fancy word for unwanted narrowings)

By increasing the quality of surgery the company offer the hospitals higher efficiency during operations, lower costs due to lower need for re-interventions, and in the US, probably a few less lawsuits.

The product is cleared for sale in all the major markets, as Europe, USA and Japan.

The market:

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the western world, and also an increasing cause in regions now adopting a western lifestyle such as several countries in  Africa and Asia.
There is s about 700 000 bypass-surgeries and 600 000 vascular procedures world wide on an annual basis. 

The largest market is the US, where about 33% of all by-pass procedures are carried out.

Medistims equipment have received recommendations as ""standards of care"" by several  respected european and british cardiology societies, and medistim hopes this will influence clinical practise in other markets, such as the US.

USA
80% of all by-pass surgeries in the US is performed without any other means of assuring blood flow than the surgeon using his/her finger to feel the pulse in the blood vessels.
So far, Medistim has a market penetration of about 13% of the total 240 000 by-pass surgeries performed in the US annually.

Medistim has developed a unique business model for the us market, where they place the machines at the hospitals free of charge, and the hospital has to pay-per-procedure by purchasing smartcards that activates the machine for one surgery pr smartcard. Not unlike  going to a carnival where you buy tokens so your children can ride the carousels.
The reason for this is the insurance system in the US, giving a more specified cost pr procedure for the hospital bills. This also avoids the barrier of making a large investment before the machine can be put to use.
If a hospital wishes to buy the machine, they are free to do so, as is common in most other parts of the world.
A part of the commercial strategy for the US is ,in addition to regular sales, lobbying towards the cardiac societies to make the technology of medistims machines ""standards-of-care"" in the US.

Europe:

In europe it is common for the hospitals to buy the machines, as the focus on cost per procedure is not that relevant, and many hospitals are required by policy to own their equipment.
they do however need to purchase the different probes and consumables for the machines, this is medistims largest source of revenue.
The VeriQC system have received praise from influential sources in the UK , but there are only few installations.
Germany is the largest market in europe with about 60 000 by-pass surgeries annually.

Asia, Latin America, The middle east and other markets:

There is a general increase in the focus on cardiac diseases  in Asia and Latin America, and there is also a rise in the number of procedures as these countries adopt a western lifestyle, so presence here is important for the company.
In Asia, Japan, is the biggest customer base as of now, with about 65% of the sales in the region, but there has also been good growth in China.
In Latin America Brazil is the country with the largest potential for Medistims products. In the Middle East and Africa, Medistims latest product, VeriQC, has been well received, led by Saudi-Arabia.

Is the company profitable?

Yes the company is profitable. 
It’s actually highly profitable in relation to the capital employed in the business. 


Some definitions:
As the numerator i use operating profits, since we want to look at the core profitability of the business.

To exclude the effects of leverage I use capital employed. More spesifically, working capital + tangible assets, and i also include R&D since a big part of this companys strategy is to continue to develop their product. Goodwill is excluded.

With this as my starting point, the return on capital employed I get is an impressive 21,2%

If I exclude all intangibles I get 59% but I don’t think that is relevant, since the R&D of their systems is such a vital part of their future business. 
Between 2003 and 2013 the company has had an EBIT growth of about 16%compounded annually 
In 2013 the company’s divident payout was 51,9% of earnings. The divident has been growing about 13% annually since 2006, excluding 2014 , where the divident was reduced in relation with developing the 4th generation system MeriQ

Is the business  stable?

I would think so. I assume that most heart attacks in the general population  are unrelated to macro-economic events, although I would be inclined to believe that you might see an increase in incidents among traders in bear markets. 
On a long, long term however I think we will see a declining trend of cardiac incidents in the western world, as lifestyle related diseases are gaining focus. This may be offset by the other countries adopting western habits.


Competitive advantage, market position?

I reckon that the technology can be reproduced by other companies. If there exists a competitive advantage for these machines I suspect it will be high switching costs, probably not money, but time.
I am no expert in this area, but I expect that using a machine like this takes some practice and familiarisation before It performs optimally for the surgeon, and that surgeons and clinics familiar with the setup and handling of this machine will be reluctant to change systems, and spend time and resources on familiarisation with a new product if the competing product does not offer huge advantages.

If this advantage really do exist, as their high return on capital indicates, it will be essential for Medistim to maintain their R&D spending, and keep on the cutting edge of the technology, or they will probably be marginalized by competitors.
They are the market leader with this technology, having a global penetration of about 23%. Competitors have about 7% so there is still 70% of the global market available
As of now, they are the only company with machines that offer both measurement of flow, and ultrasound imaging.
The company is in the process of launching its 4th generation system, the MiraQ.

The revenue:

Aftermarket probes is the key revenue component. This is not bad news if you ask me, having a strong aftermarket as the base for revenue.

As one would assume, selling these machines is not like selling candy, and takes some time. And even though machine sales is not a the biggest source of revenue, it is key to the “aftermarket” probe sales, so when the company books a machine sale, it also books a recurring revenue stream, wich is always nice.

Third party sales is also a large part of the revenue. This seems to be because of the relatively larger market penetration in the north european markets, where this is a necessary service to maintain profitability. The third pary products are, according to the company, carefully chosen to fit the same customer base as the ultrasound systems.

Is the balance sheet clean?

The balance sheet is rock solid as far as I can see. The company has virtually no debt (equity is 69% of total assets) and a solid cash position. quick ratio=1,85. Their biggest liability is Tax and social liabilities.

There are not many tangible assets though, but I think this reflects the nature of the business, as it is capital light.

Do they generate cash?

Yes. Plenty. Although they periodically use a lot of it to develop their systems, they generally generate a lot of cash.

Is there anything I don’t like about this company?

Yes, of course, there always is

– In the 2013 annual report there was a substansial increase in accounts receivables. Now this might be troublesome, as it may indicate that the company is pushing product to agressivly, or loosening credit terms to book sales. I consider this a warning sign that is worth monitoring closely if an investment were to be made in this company. The receivables have been reduced some in the second quarter 2014, which is a good sign, but I would keep an eye on this

-Since the company operates in different markets, it uses currency hedges to reduce exposure to fluctuations. I am no expert in financial derivatives, but I would wish the mechanics of the contracts were described in more detail it the statements so it would be easier to understand the true nature of them. I know that currency hedges is commonly used by companies with operations in different regions, so for now I am willing to assume that they are of a normal nature, but I make a note to myself to increase my knowledge of currency hedges

-although the company has been growing impressively in the past, this is no guarantee that they will be able to do so in the future. A lot seems to be dependant on the US market, and should the technology become standards-of-practice in the US, I bet you would see  competition rizing in the blink of an eye.

The company has an impressive return on capital, which indicates competitive advantage, but it also has a staggering divident payout ratio. This indicates that the company can not reinvest all of its earnings in a profitable way. Now I know that earning too much sounds like a luxury problem, But the current situation makes it difficult for the company to create wealth for a new shareholder. The stock is priced at a level where they should not buy shares (in my opinion) and it’s also priced at a level that does not offer a very nice divident yield. I think this explains why the stock has not been moving much the last few years.  As I see it this stock is a low risk, low paying investment with a potential for something bigger.

So what is it worth?

Now this is where it gets problematic. I have done a series of valuations using different techniques to try to put an estimate on my assessment of fair value. I was surprised of the relatively low fair value spread i got between my calculations.

My assessment of fair value is 18-24NOK.

This is below the current stock price of 26NOK, and leaves no margin of safety.

So why is this problematic? Well these estimates is my assessment of the fair value of the stock, as it is today, But it does not in any way include the growth potential that would be available if the companys technology should become standards-of-practice in the US. I also do not know how their recent approval in Russia will pan out. I have a nagging sensation that my estimates are too conservative, but I have no reasonable way to know without opening the door for pure speculation. For example; what do I know about lobbying in the US health care industry? absolutely nothing.

I could ofcourse change my required return rates, and growth estimates until I received a higher fair value, but I don’t want to go there.

There are some aspects of this company that makes me want a discount before considering investing, In particular i mention the rise on accounts receivables, my lacking understanding of the currency hedges and uncertainty about growth prospects.  There are also several aspects of the company that makes me want to be an owner.

I will keep an eye on this company, and should the price fall I probably will be a buyer, I might even initiate a small tracking position, but I fear that this will be “one that got away”

The question is what proportion of United Airline's risk is market risk? My initial answer is 1/3 (22%/66%) ...my thinking is, any risk as measured by standard deviation or variance above the market averages should be risk that is specific to the firm or its sector.

t3_2nytrs,Question on NOL Valuation,"idiot question: Say I have a company with 2 billion in NOLs, a pretax income of 500 million, and a normal tax rate of 40%.  Forgetting the time value of money for a moment, how should I look at the manner in which the NOL is exhausted?  Do you I use up 200 a year for 10 years--that is, the value by which the NOL is reduced is the tax that would have been paid (40% times 500).  Or is the NOL reduced based on the pre-tax income that it covers--that is, it would deplete in four years since the NOL would cover 500 million in pre-tax income dollars.

So this is a bit of an issue that I'm having... And i'm hoping you guys will have some insight for me... i'm 33 and financially savvy.  Big believer and follower in value investing, and valuing money, and a Saver.  I meet this cute and fun girl 6 months ago, we hang out and she is amazing.  she is full of life, doesn't let anything get to her, literally always happy.  She starts conversations with anyone and everyone, pets every single dog, says hello to every little kid, and i crack up each time I'm talking to her and hanging out with her.  Never a serious, dull, or sad moment (I had a miserable ex girlfriend that was always mad).  Now this is the tough part.... She has discalcula (i had to look it up) and she has no idea how to budget since her parents pay all her expenses.  She doesn't make much as an assistant in child care, but she has a college degree and no debt.  Her parents have a family business, and she's an only child.  Apparently the business does well,  i don't know.  She is 28, her rent is fully paid, anything on her credit card is paid off by them at the end of the month.  She loves shopping and can fill up bags.  Sense my problem?  We aren't officially a couple but a choice has to be made moving forward.  I need a mature partner, where we don't rely on our parents.  That is my goal.  But her personality is to the moon.  Sorry for posting this here I'm hoping someone has experience with something similar!! thanks.

Additionally, I want to ensure the content and comment quality in this sub remains high as subscriber growth continues.

* **1.	Read the Sidebar and Use the Resources there**

I don’t think people understand how useful the links on the Sidebar are. I have come to use many of the resources there regularly. Here are some resources that have been helpful for me:

**[Reading List](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/239qj8/updated_reading_list/)** – There are great books for learning about all aspects of Value Investing. The Reading List is separated by topic for ease of use and was updated in early 2014.

**[MBA Finance & Valuation Classes](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.ca/2014/01/its-personal-my-experiments-with-online.html)** – Damodaran’s classes are a great way to improve your Corporate Finance and Valuation skills. Lessons learned here become very powerful when combined with the unit economics of the businesses you examine. The Sidebar Links will remain updated when the new classes are posted.

**Financial Information** – [EDGAR](http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) and [SEDAR](http://www.sedar.com/search/search_en.htm). I read a lot of financial statements and I prefer to get them directly from the source. [SEC Live](http://www.seclive.com/) may be useful for those that find wading through EDGAR difficult. You miss out on information that companies are providing to the financial regulatory authorities if you only read 10-Ks and 10-Qs. In addition to other financial filings, also examine at press releases, earning call replays/transcripts, executive interviews, business articles, and books about companies/industries. 

**Stock Exchanges** – Many countries don’t have an entity like EDGAR or SEDAR, but company financial information can be obtained directly from the stock exchanges. 

**[Ben Graham Centre](http://www.bengrahaminvesting.ca/)** – This is the website for the Ivey Business School in Canada. They have a great value investing tradition and their website has links to Value Investing academic research, Guest Speakers, and other resources.

**[Value Investor’s Club](http://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/value2/)** – Contains stock pitches from value investors that usually have a special situations angle. Steal ideas from where Greenblatt steals ideas from. If you want to see what a good stock pitch and analysis looks like, sign up for a guest account here and read the highest rated ideas.

**[Macabacus](http://macabacus.com/)** – Has many great financial models available to download for free. Examining the structure and formatting of these models will help you improve your financial modelling skills. I recommend that you combine these models with Damodaran's Corporate Finance & Valuation Classes.

**[Whale Wisdom](http://whalewisdom.com/)** – I shamelessly steal ideas from other investors. Every once in awhile I find a new fund that is worth tracking by browsing the posts there.

* **2.	If you’d like to discuss securities, your post must contain analysis**

Analysis is not a recitation of P/E Ratios or Growth Rates. Analysis should mention how the company’s business, assets, earnings, industry, or other factors makes the security you’re discussing undervalued.

Your post doesn't have to be as thorough as the ones on Value Investor's Club. For example, look at what [bigwoody did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/p333a/energy_stock_manifesto/), what [Coldheat did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/qadv8/btctake_a_look_and_tell_me_what_you_think/), what [paperpump did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1qi93s/long_pitch_par_petroleum_parr/), or what [currygoat did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1jtbyt/quick_and_dirty_washington_post_valuation/). We desire to keep the discussion in this sub high level and want to prevent it from devolving into mindless chatter.

**Your post will be deleted if it does not contain any analysis as baseless speculation helps no one.** It is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation.

* **3.	Ask Questions**

Asking questions fosters worthwhile discussion and helps people improve their skills as an investor. Please don’t attempt to answer questions if you don’t know the answer. Once again, it is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation. 

/u/time2roll has done a great job [asking great questions over the past year](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=author%3Atime2roll&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). I'd look to those posts as an example of the type of discussion that can be fostered. There are some very knowledgeable people in this subreddit. 


* **4.	Post interesting articles about Investment Search Strategy, Investment Analysis, Value Investing Philosophy, and Risk Management Techniques**

You'll find plenty of things to post if you read with an active mind. News, especially business news, should be read as events that people make happen rather than things happening randomly. Once you start asking why people are making these things happen, the news will become an examination of how companies respond to their competitors, how products evolve to meet the needs of customers, and how management creates or destroys value for shareholders. Each bit of news about a company or industry can be used as a building block to a case study in valuing companies.

* **5.	If you don’t know how to analyze securities, read books in the reading list, use the resources on the sidebar, and ask questions**

I’m aware this is essentially the same point as #1, but I want to reiterate how great the Sidebar is. **Use it.**

My questions are, what is your average yearly rate of return on your portfolio, how much do you research do you normally do, and how much experience do you have? Does your rate of return beat out index funds? If it does, by how much?

t3_2rv64j,Constructing an asset allocation model for optimal geographical diversification,"A client recently tasked us with creating a relatively simple asset allocation model for optimal geographical diversification.

I've been doing my own research for awhile before it crossed my mind that some of you here may have done it already here.

t3_2shmjm,VRS - Verso Company,"Commentary - I'm really new to this and have little understanding of the paper business or the effects of energy prices on the company (which from my limited understanding, lower prices should increase profitability).

Analysis:

Verso and NewPage create paper products (an industry in decline).

I read the news that there was a merger involving Verso Paper buying out NewPage.  A number of things stuck out at me from the beginning - how does the #2 company in an industry buy out the #1 company if the #2 company isn't making any money?  What was particularly striking to me was that both companies showed a loss for the past few years in an industry that was on the decline.  In particular, both companies were losing money so why bother in the first place?  I spent a few hours digging through the documents to try to understand the point of the merger.

After digging, I emerged with a better understanding of the deal.  To call it Verso acquiring NewPage misses the entire nature of the transaction.  It would be better considered as NewPage acquiring Verso and the bond holders taking a haircut to produce a financially viable company.  It's really a bankruptcy and consolidation all rolled into one deal.  Since NewPage is much larger than Verso, looking at the history of Verso is beyond useless.

The basic premise of my valuation is this: NewPage + Verso creates a company with EBITDA of $419M and a debt service (at rates above 12%) of ~$122M per year.  Even if both companies gain exactly zero efficiency on the deal, the merger has created a company that adequately covers it's debt service.  The nature of the business is cyclical and decreasing over time, but I don't expect that management of this company predicts that they will be out of business in under 4 years.

So now we are evaluating a company with $3.5B in revenue, earnings after debt service of $300M per year and leveraged up to the gills.  The chance of default is somewhat lowered - it would be tough to imagine conditions that result in a 2/3 reduction in earnings.  Of course the leverage produces an interesting situation of heads stockholders win, tails bondholders lose.

On the face of it, the merger has created a conservatively leveraged business in a declining industry.  The stakeholders are previous bond holders that probably don't desire to own a paper mill company or shareholders in NewPage that just got a huge cash payout.  I would imagine that this company is under huge selling pressure and the actual value isn't readily apparent.

Value pros:  
Conservative leverage  
Shareholders are motivated to dump shares - many were owners of NewPage that just got cash payouts or bondholders  
High debt to equity ratio  
Capitalization is currently at $200M - too low for institutional investors  
P/E ratio is currently less than 1  
Declining industry  

Value cons:  
No insider buys - management paid in cash  
Ownership by Apollo management  
Management's stated purpose is debt paydown then diversification  
Industry in decline at around 3% per year  
Cyclical indistry  

The kicker:
If the company makes money, they can multiply that return by buying their own debt at $0.60 on the dollar.  
If they exceed expectations, all they need to do is continue paying down debt to continue growth for a few years.

t3_2sh2wb,"What do you do when you've found a good deal, but have little experience with value investing?","I found what I think is a great deal - the type where the value jumps right off the page for me to such an extent that you don't need a complicated equation to understand that it's undervalued.

I just don't understand how much to put after the investment.  I'm doing this as a hobby rather than banking my future on it and so my investment so far is just chump change out of my own personal fun money ($200).  However I've been thinking today and it doesn't make a lot of sense to put a great idea in my taxable accounts - why not put about 1% of my Roth towards the idea if it's so great?  If it's a miss, the value goes to 0 and I lose 1% on the year, if it's a hit I gain about 4% and if it's a home run I might get more. 

The other thought is to slowly channel some of my fun money towards it and build up to a position that I'm OK with losing.  The problem is that fun money trickles in relatively slowly and if the market sees the value that I see or the earnings bear it out, then I'm going to have missed the opportunity.

I'd love to just post it here to have others take a look at the idea, but if it's obvious to me, I'm afraid that I'll just get piggybacked by a big fish in a small pond and lose the opportunity to buy any more of it.

Long Yahoo = 0.4 shares of SpinCo  AND 1 share of RemainCo

SpinCo = BABA * (SpinCo discount)

So Long Yahoo = 0.4 BABA * (SpinCo Discount) + RemainCoStub

Add a short BABA to the equation to take out that volatility

(43.73) - (0.4 * 89.81) = (0.4 * 89.81)(SpinCoDiscount) + RemainCo Stub

$7.81 = SpinCo Discount + RemainCo Stub

$7.81 - SpinCo Discount = RemainCo Stub

The idea is that you are buying $20 of RemainCo intrinsic value (that $20 will vary depending on what you value YHOO at) for $7.80 + whatever SpinCo discount will be in dollar terms.

t3_2v4221,Canadian Stocks: Investing without resources III,"Another year has passed since my last post: http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1y9jev/canadian_stocks_investing_without_resources_ii/

Once again, lets review the three stocks that had been mentioned in prior posts.  Since February, Glentel is up 90%, AutoCanada is up 4.8% and Exchange Income Fund is flat.  Recall, these securities provide lofty dividend yields which I am not including in my return calculations.  

The past year was a great reminder of the famous Warren Buffet quote, ""Price is what you pay. Value is what you get"".  Stock prices often deviate greatly from fundamentals.  In the case of GLN, the stock had precipitously declined from $20 in 2013 to a low of less than $10.  The details of why this occurred can be found in my previous post.  However, the underlying thesis (value) remained in tact and this year the company was purchased at an all time high valuation of $26.50 by BCE and Rogers.  In fact, if you account for the deal terms proposed by BCE, the value is currently closer to $30/sh.  This represents a return of over 25% compounded annually since my first post.

AutoCanada had a rather volatile year, reaching a high of over $90 to a low of almost $30.  Despite this decline, investors have still been privileged to an 85% compounded annual return since my first post.  Reviewing the year, it is clear the at its peak, ACQ was significantly over valued.  At $90, investors were pricing in more then a reasonable pace of acquisitions as well as giving the underlying dealerships valuations that were well in excess of its US peers.  Today, at $41, I believe the stock represents good value.  The company now trades at a discount to its US peers and the company valuation better represents the known dealer acquisitions presented by management.  The caveat to all this remains the outlook for the Western Canadian auto market (where ACQ still has considerable concentration).  In the short term, autosales may slow for 2015 as the western market deals with the oil price shock.    However, long term the original thesis remains in tact and investors should look at the current situation as an opportunity to average into the stock throughout 2015.

The past year for Exchange Income Fund demonstrated the value of good management teams.  The team at EIF appropriately decided to sell their ownership of West Tower to none other than Maztec (mentioned in the previous post).  Despite managements difficulties with running this business, they managed to sell it at a considerable profit (over 2x what they paid).  I was pleased with the decision (and somewhat shocked at the price MTZ paid) but still question managements ability to successful invest shareholder capital.  Since I first wrote about the company, the stock price has declined 3.9% a year only to be offset by its 7% dividend.  As a result, investors have still received a 3% total return.  Unfortunately, this is still too low given the alternatives provided by significantly lower risk investments.  

For those who have found these past 3 infrequent posts interesting, please comment.  For the next 3 years, I have identified another 3 non-resource Canadian investments that I will write about in the coming weeks.

Yara International (from hereon referred to as ""Yara"" or ""the company"") is a Norwegian company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker YAR. Yara's main business area is the production of fertilizers used in the agricultural industry. The main focus is on nitrogen-based fertilizers, however, Yara also produces phosphate-based fertilizers and potassium-based fertilizers. Yara's other business areas includes the production of dry ice, nitrates, ammonia, urea and other nitrogen-based chemicals. Yara is the world's largest supplier of plant nutrients. 

The biggest shareholder is the Norwegian government which owns 36,2% of the shares.

[One year price development](http://i.imgur.com/6goVMAc.png)

*Before I continue with the analysis I have a word for the readers. This is my second published analysis (you can read the first one [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2jvq8v/lets_take_a_look_at_prosafe_my_first_analysis/)) and English is not my first language. Therefore you have to expect some grammatical mistakes. Please bear with me. Since I'm a novice security analyst, I hope that you will provide some constructive feedback or advices to my ongoing journey of becoming an expert security analyst. Everything from suggesting books that I should read to raising question about the analysis is very welcome. With that said. Let's begin.*

**Yara in a macroeconomic setting**

Yara's earnings are highly dependent on the state of the agricultural industry which is a cyclical industry. This makes Yara a cyclical company. Looking at the numbers through a cycle (see ""The numbers"" section) shows that Yara is dependent on the cycle, as you would expect of a cyclical company, but can handle being in the bottom of a cycle without experiencing financial distress.

 At the present moment Yara is thriving due to high USD/NOK exchange rate and low gas prices. The exchange rate benefits Yara because of the increased competitivenes a weakened currency brings. 

 The lower natural gas price is essential to Yara because the production of (nitrogen) fertilizers requires massive amounts of natural gas. A further reduction (or just a non-increase) in the price of natural gas is a major potential catalyst for increased earnings in 2015. 

 In the long term, Yara has a positive exposure to several megatrends. The megatrends that are going to benefit Yara are:

* Higher population and higher food demand - This is obvious since Yara is producing fertilizers used to increase crop yield.
* Higher urbanization - Fewer farmers are going to supply food to a growing urban population. Effective fertilizers are essential if you want to have enough food in the future urbanized world. 
* Focus on climate changes - Yara is highly focused on sustainability and is commited to creating a sustainable agriculturial industry and provide green solutions for farmers.
* Resource scarcity - The fertilizers increases crop yield and less water (and other scarce resources) are needed for food production. 

**Moat**

As the world's largest producer of plant nutrients, Yara has a clear production cost advantage through economics of scale.

 Being the world's largest producer of plant nutrients, Yara has developed a strong brand worldwide. Yara is especially known for producing high quality products and for being focused on sustainability.

**The numbers**

I want to start this section with a review of the 10 year financial results. 

[Ten year summary](http://i.imgur.com/gKnCxq4.png)

 As can be seen in the picture above, Yara has had strong growth in revenue and earnings over the last ten years. The balance sheet has also strengthened significantly over this period of time. The increase in NIBD from 2013-2014 is a result of two recent acquisitions. Even after this new debt, Yara remains solid with a debt/equity of 64,26% and high solvency (see solvency number under the ""Competition"" section). 

 Looking at the fertilizer sales per region shows that Yara is diversified across most of the globe. This prevents adverse economic developments in one part of the world (droughts, floods, war etc.) from bankrupting Yara. Europe and Latin America are the biggest markets. 

[Fertilizer sales by region](http://i.imgur.com/ujVLDKn.png)

 As stated in the introduction, Yara is diversified across different products. The picture belows shows the production volumes of Yara's products. Nitrogen products make up a big part of the production volume which makes Yara highly dependent on natural gas prices. 

[Production volumes](http://i.imgur.com/lWa7tD3.png)

**Management in short**

The CEO of Yara International, Torgeir Kvidal, has a long history in Yara International. He started as trainee in 1991 (back then Yara was a part of Norsk Hydro) and has advanced internally reaching CFO in 2012. He held this position until October 2014 where he was appointed CEO. One of Torgeir Kvidal's predecessors in the CEO role (Thorleif Enger who left in 2008) was involved in a corruption scandal involving Yara's foreign activities. Torgeir Kvidal does not strike me as a kind who will follow in the shoes of Thorleif Enger and engage in these kinds of activities. He answers question straight up and he seems like a person of integrity who is not going to sweep scandals and illegalities under the rug. 

 Reading through transcripts from earning calls and public statements, all members of the management seem to abide by Yara's ""Ambition, Trust, Accountability and Teamwork""-culture.

**Dividend and share buyback**

Yara's dividend policy is to pay out at least 30% of earnings as dividends. Yara had to cut dividends from 13NOK to 10NOK in 2013 due to lower earnings but it has been raised back to 13NOK in 2015. The current dividend yield is at 3,12% (with a current price of 417 NOK). The dividend has increased 20,93% per year annualized.

[Graph of dividends and payout ratio](http://i.imgur.com/DG3LgOR.png)

 Yara also has a buyback policy in place to return more cash to shareholders. Yara aims to return 40-45% of net income through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. 

**Competition**

The following four companies are also operating in the plant nutrient field and are used for comparison.

* CF Industries produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizers and other nitrogen products. Yara and CF Industries recently talked about merging but it fell through.
* The Mosaic Company produces fertilizers mainly from phosphate. 
* Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan produces and sells fertilizers and related products to the agricultural industry. 
* Agrium produces, retails, and distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, seeds, and agronomics.

[Competition vs. Yara](http://i.imgur.com/4163oLG.png)

 Looking at the numbers, Yara looks the best of the bunch due to a solid financial position and high dividend yield combined with the best RoC of the bunch. RoE is only mediocre but this is mainly a result of lower leverage.

**Risks**

Yara is very dependent on the agricultural industry. A slowdown in the cyclical agricultural industry will hurt Yara. 

 Yara is highly dependent on the price of natural gas. Right now Yara is thriving because of the fall in the price of gas but a new rally could hurt Yara. I expect that Yara will lock in the current, favorable prices or hedge against a rally over the short-mid term, but eventually an increase in natural gas prices will hurt Yara.

**Valuation**

I am going to do a relative valuation of Yara compared to its competitors and a dividend discount model to reach a valuation. 

[Relative valuation](http://i.imgur.com/LFsTFfI.png)

 Looking at all three multiples, Yara looks undervalued compared to its competitors. Yara's strong numbers combined with Yara's strong moat suggests that a higher valuation could be justified. I could see Yara being valued at 17-18 times FY2014 earnings (469-497 NOK / upside of 12-19% excluding dividend) if the strong Q4 results continues in 2015.

Assumptions for DDM:

* Three stage DDM model
* High growth for 5 years with dividend growth of 10% per year
* Transition period for 3 years
* Stable period with dividend growth of 3% per year
* Cost of equity of 9,49%. Calculated using Damodaran's method

Everything taken into account these numbers are fairly conservative and provide a good base case valuation. The result of the DDM is a fair price of 462 NOK equal to a P/E of 17 and an upside of 12%. 

**Summary and recommendation**

Yara International is a strong, healthy company thriving in the current economic environment. The future looks bright for the company, especially in the long term, due to exposure to several megatrends. Yara is thriving right now due to a high dollar and low gas prices. This has sparked a rally in the stock price over the last year and the company is currently trading at a P/E around 15 with a dividend yield at just over 3%. Looking at a relative valuation, the stock still looks slightly undervalued compared to its competitors and a conservative DDM supports this conclusion.

 My recommendation:

 Long term investors looking for a great companies at a reasonable prices can start accumulating at the current price. 

 People looking for great value opportunities can add to watchlist and buy on any pullback/correction.

*DISCLAIMER: I am a novice security analyst and even though I have worked on this analysis for quite some time, there is no doubt that I have overlooked something important. I advice you to do your own due dilligence before investing in Yara International.*

t3_2wdd6w,What am I missing with Lee Enterprises?,"I came across this company and it seems cheap as it trades lower than peers in addition to a great FCF yield. It has a tremendous debt load from a failed acquisition of Pulitzer in 2005. However, I and the investor in this article (which I will link in the comments), believes the company can use the FCF to pay down their debt load by 2023. The company declared bankruptcy in 2011, and reemerged in 2012. I do not think the market is taking into account that a) it is a newspaper company which is mixing its revenue more into growing digital subscriptions and advertising and b) that management does have capability of paying down this debt as well as c)it is a small cap at around 150 million dollars and may not get the attention it needs. The intrinsic value is much higher than it trading at currently. Additionally, a new hedge fund revealed a 9.1% stake in the company which was its debt financing partner before this event. This signals to me that the hedge fund believe the company can payoff its debt load that it is willing to take a huge stake. It would make no sense for debt lender to want to see its equity burn if the company was to go bankrupt since it could just seize Lee's assets in bankruptcy with the debt it owns. I know I did not post my own thorough analysis cause I have not completed my own DCF yet, but on first glance what else should I look out for besides its heavy debt as well as industry it is in? Thanks all, I appreciate any insights as a young investor who is trying to learn appreciates it.

If there is another deleveraging in the same vein as 2000 and 2007, we could see ample undervalued opportunities. Anyone else holding onto cash?

I had previously read bits and pieces of the Berkshire Hathaway letters but had never taken the time to complete the entire ~50 years. Last June after attending the BRK AGM I loaded up [Max Olson's anthology](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0615975070/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) on my Kindle (just $2.50!) and over the course of the summer finished it. I used the Kindle's built-in note-taking features to record the best quotes.

**I would recommend anyone who is dedicated to fundamental investing (professional or focused amateurs) read the original letters in their entirety because you may find different sections meaningful.** Furthermore, what this summary fails to capture is the context of business performance for each year. **For those who fit the above, I think the best way to approach the letters is to start by reading [The Snowball](http://www.amazon.com/Snowball-Alice-Schroeder-ebook/dp/B009MYD9F8/), read the [partnership letters](http://www.rbcpa.com/WEB_letters/WEB_Letters_pre_berkshire.html) (which I admit to not having finished yet) up to 1965, and then dive in (reading the 1965-1969 BPL letters alongside BRK's).**

Anyway, for those looking for one, this is an ok summary at less than 10% of the length of the full letters. It includes a mix of bite-size quotes and most if not all of the longer essays. It hasn't been edited in any significant way so the relevance of some may be merely personal, context is occasionally lacking, and formatting is rough.

Unfortunately the letters aren't properly separated by year so the specific year references aren't included. The page references refer to Olson's Kindle version linked above.

t3_2wvsv1,"A daily DCF calculation for stocks on the NYSE, Nasdaq, LSE and ASX","For anyone looking to value stocks using discounted cash flow this may be a useful tool to form *part* of your due diligence.  

Or if you are looking to learn about how to do a DCF calculation, this will also be useful as we provide a worked example for each company.  

Simply Wall St now does a Discounted Cash Flow for companies listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, LSE and ASX on a daily basis. As always we present the results in infographic format, however if you click on the black bar chart, you can also see the full detail behind the calculation.  
  
Here are a couple of example companies (remember to click the black bar chart for detail):
http://simplywall.st/NYSE:IBM/international-business-machines#value  
http://simplywall.st/NasdaqGS:MSFT/microsoft#value  
  
  
The idea behind this post is to get feedback on the calculation:  
1)	As a newbie are you able to understandable how the calculation is presented?  
2)	If you have some experience with DCF do you have any opinions on the assumptions and inputs used?  

Bear in mind on Simply Wall St we need to be able to do this calculation for any listed stock (subject to analyst coverage) without human intervention, hence conservative assumptions are used where possible.  
  
To give a few details on the calculation:  

**Which cash flow is discounted?**  
As the calculation is intended to be used for valuing stocks, an Equity valuation is performed. This is as opposed to a Firm valuation which would include the value to any debtors. This uses Levered Free Cash Flow.  

In the case of Banks, Financial Service companies, REIT’s and Insurance firms dividends are used instead as Free Cash Flow is difficult to estimate and often not even reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of FCF as a dividend, this method will underestimate the value of the stock.   
  
**Which growth pattern is used?**  
The calculation allows for 5 years of high growth followed by stable growth.  
  
**Where is the data sourced from?**  
Consensus estimates (e.g. the mean of 20 analysts) for Levered Free Cash Flow or Dividends are used. If this does not exist for any given year the cash flow is assumed to grow at the average annual growth rate in revenue from the last 5 years.  
  
**Which method is used to calculate Terminal Value?**  
The Perpetuity Method (Gordon Formula) is used to calculate Terminal Value at an annual growth rate equal to the 10 year government bond rate.  
  
**What discount rate is used?**  
In the case of a Free Cash Flow to Equity Calculation the Cost of Equity is used as a discount rate. This is calculated from the Risk Free Rate (the 10 year government bond rate is used), the stocks Beta (see below) and a Market Risk Premium (Currently 10% - Risk Free Rate).  
  
**How is the bottom up Beta calculated?**  
A bottom up Beta is calculated for each company by looking at the Unlevered Beta for companies in the same industry and then levered to account for any debt.

t3_2wyggu,Please tell me that something is wrong with this train of thought regarding QE and lowering rates and the future value of the market.,"I will keep this short as I can; at the cost of specificity perhaps someone will be more inclined to read and offer a thought:

I fear that QE and lowering rates consistently in times of bad economic news will actually cause asset prices to collapse. I did not say believe; please bear with my thought process:

~~QE and lowering rates are processes instituted to combat inflation.~~ By lowering yields directly through creating excess liquidity (QE) and lowering the fed funds rate to induce lending and activity, we effectively inflate asset prices. This has been observed.

However, what I wonder is if what we are seeing is essentially a trickle down effect in the inflation of asset prices. The closer the ""proximity"" of the asset to QE and interest rates in terms of degrees of sensitivity, the higher the ""inflation"" of those assets. This evident through stock & bond returns and makes sense in the modelling of financial assets.

However, other assets are also inflated, including their costs. The trickle down I describe manifests itself in the inflation of technology, insurance, medical tech/care, etc. 

The inflation of the former represents a massive increase in costs for the middle-class and lower income households who do not benefit proportionally to the increase of value in their assets (home equity and smaller portfolios if any). 

The costs increase as the mid-sensitive assets described two paragraphs above appreciate faster than anything else the broad consumer base owns. The further the degree of separation from QE and lowered rates, the less of an effect it has. One of these assets if you will, that is not getting inflated falls far in degrees of separation from lowered interest rates and QE: wages. (This kind of logic can be observed to some extent in movements of the shorter maturity end of the yield curve versus the long end [i.e. prime rate vs 30 yr bond] where proximity to the fed funds rate directly increases percentage movements on relative terms)

In effect if this relationship is true, assets and their costs increase at higher degrees than the consumer's ability to pay for them and thus the broad market consumer becomes poorer.

As this base gets poorer, they cannot drive companies' earnings. Eventually, the cycle completes a circle where the corporation itself cannot cover assets and liabilities that are inflating faster than its own wages, in this case earnings per share.

In this theoretical scenario, the market begins to weaken and central bank policy dictates that they must cut rates again and by doing so, forcing the problem further. 

Some argued that QE did not work in Japan in the 2000's because of factors like the population's age and propensity to save. It is interesting to consider that QE and lowering rates may not work so well elsewhere and the US simply because it is the nature of our consumer to spend. 

If this is the case, recognition of this problem and its degrees of severity would come too late; a rapid deterioration of the spending base will only become present when the consumer has not changed their attitudes toward spending, but rather has lost their capacity to do so resulting in a massive decline in the confidence of companies to generate earnings and pay their liabilities.

I would appreciate any thoughts, thank you. ",2,0.67,1424753483.0
t3_2x5gxg,Finding quality companies,"""Invest in quality companies"", is probably the most common advice heard from outstanding investors.

Of course my final preference is for the company to have room in the market for future growth as well.

First off, English is not my mother tongue, so please bear with me if I make a mistake here and there. :-)

I've been gathering intelligence on value investing and to this end I've compiled a list of some seven books that I'm just about to buy. Pretty much all of them cover value investing to a greater or lesser extent, it's only their perspectives, focus and approach that may well vary - a detailed analysis of financial statements, contrarianism, mean reversion, deep value, etc., even though obviously there's bound to be a big overlap. 

At any rate, I'm having difficulty finding books on this sort of topic from a broader perspective. In other words, rather than individual businesses, I'd also be interested in learning more about how sectors/industries that are out of favor at some point (e.g. energy and basic materials at present) perform over time, to which degree they mean revert, etc. Books on this issue are either non-existent or at most few and far between (unlike countless books on picking undervalued stocks), and in fact I have yet to find a comprehensive book on the valuation of industries. 

My strategy would be to look for apparently undervalued stocks in sectors/industries that are 'unloved' at some point (or perhaps also the other way round, i.e. to go against overbought stocks in the most overvalued industries) and may well revert to the mean sooner or later. However, I'm lacking information on specifics vis-a-vis valuations within individual industries/sectors as well as on what matters the most in those industries/sectors.

Second, I'd be interested in valuations within countries and/or regions. I know that Damodaran has a huge set of multiples on all sorts of things (including industries and countries), but plain tables is not the kind of thing to start with. In addition, I believe he only has current data, not whatever has happened in the past.

* FY2015 projections based off of estimates made by the Company during this quarterly report

* FY2015 projections based off of double the store growth estimates made by the Company during this quarterly report

* FY2017 projections based off of estimates made by the Company during this quarterly report

* FY2019 projections based off of estimates made by the Company during this quarterly report

* FY2015 projections based off of my estimates of the Company's 2015 growth

I created an excel model that roughly accounted for the following variables:

* Growth in domestic, company-owned stores (DCO)

* Same-Shak comp store sales growth for DCOs

* Individual operating expense growth for DCOs

* Growth in licensed stores

* Growth in licensing fees

[Picture of the Excel Model](http://i.imgur.com/GiLY5SO.png)

[Full results can be found here](http://i.imgur.com/VJX0xRw.png)

Summary of the Results:
Based on the Company’s history and forward-looking statements made by the Company, it is reasonable to expect sales to grow between 38% and 42% for FY 2015, annually at 27.24% between now and FY 2017, and annually at 25.31% between now and FY 2019.  Earnings are expected to grow 79% annually between now and FY 2017 and 56% annually between now and 2019.  It is my belief that a quality company such as SHAK that experiences this level of growth should trade at a price-to-earnings multiple of around twice the annualized growth rate.  Looking out at the next three to five years, I expect an earnings and revenue growth rate of between 56% and 79% and between 25% and 27% respectively.  Merging the higher of the two, I come to an annual growth rate for the next three to five years of 53%.  Using my FY 2015 operating income projections, this would value SHAK at $525.75 Million, or $14.50 per share.  **In other words, it is my opinion that the original $14-$16 SHAK IPO range was, indeed, accurate, and that the stock is currently overvalued by 3.35 times.**



I am currently short 115 shares of Shake Shack (SHAK) [proof](http://i.imgur.com/L8QjM5y.png).

Edit: Formating as well as I figured I would add these multiples in there:

As of when I wrote this, SHAK trades at the following multiples:

* 162.3 times Company-predicted FY2015 earnings

* 10.8 times Company-predicted FY2015 sales

* 57.47 times double growth of Company-predicted FY2015 earnings

t3_2zmcz7,Clarification on Unlevering Financial Statements,"Spending some time with Stephen Penman's *Accounting for Value*, which I've found to be very insightful, thought provoking, and challenging (in a good way) to my current value approach on investing. He spends some time talking about ""unlevering"" the financials to separate the enterprise results of the business from its financing activities.  In practice, is the purpose of doing this to strip away the noise that financing can bring into the numbers?  To value a company purely on the basis of its operating results, irregardless of how it may be financed?  Thanks for the help!

*I apologize in advance if my question seems vague.  I'm on my second read-through, still working to wrap my head around the full implications of his valuation approach.*

Some quotes from the book: 

* ""Unlever the accounting numbers and develop the valuation from these unlevered numbers.  In doing so, one protects from paying for profitability and growth generated by leverage.""

* ""Unlevering the accounting involves separating those accounting numbers that have to do with the business operations from those that have to do with financing activities.... To demonstrate, let's start with the balance sheet under GAAP and IFRS and identify assets and liabilities associated with the business enterprise and those associated with the financing of the business... **Operating assets** are those employed in the business, like receivables, inventory, and plant. **Operating liabilities** are liabilities incurred in the course of business, like accounts payable, deferred revenues, and accrued expenses. **Financial liabilities** are the debt from raising cash to finance the business, like bonds payable and bank loans, whereas **financial assets** are (interest-bearing) debt in which the firm invests to hold ""excess cash"" not required for business operations (like cash equivalents and short-term debt investments) .... The distinction makes a clear break between assets and liabilities that add value for shareholders versus the (zero-net-present-value) assets and liabilities associated with financing activities that do not.

* ""By netting assets and liabilities in these two categories against each other, common shareholders' equity is represented by net operating assets and net debt .... **The standard GAAP and IFRS balance sheet, with its distinction between current and long-term assets and liabilities, is set up for credit analysis** such that the balance sheet aggregates operating and financing items within current and long-term categories.  This is apples to oranges as far as the equity analyst is concerned. **The reformulated balance sheet ... sets up the accounting numbers for valuation.**",7,0.9,1426795214.0

I'm in agreement since Net Income (main component of EPS) can be somewhat more easily manipulated and doesn't really show how efficiently a company is at generating returns. Simply having an increase in EPS doesn't tell me much, as that money can be earning 2% in a savings account somewhere when it could be better invested (or returned).

However, the part in the book that tripped me up was Hagstrom seemed to indicate that EPS also includes Retained Earnings, which doesn't seem true to me? I could have misread something, but I was a bit confused because I thought EPS was just NI/# of shares and had no inclusion of Retained Earnings.

t3_30ef7s,"Here's a condensed summary of my research on ARLP, one of my favorite current investments (x-post r/investing)","**Background:**

Alliance Natural Resource Partners (ARLP, currently trading at around $33 a share) is a U.S. based thermal coal (the kind used for electricity, as opposed to mettalurgic coal which is used for steel). It is the 8th largest producer of coal in the country, and has consistently grown capacity by double digits per year for more than a decade.

ARLP produces only thermal coal, and does not export. It is therefore not directly affected by either international coal demand or by steel demand.

**Answer to immediate objections:**

1: ""Coal is a dying fuel, we won't be using it at all in the near future!""

* Actually every single major energy organization expects coal to generate a significant amount of our power all the way through 2040. Even the EPA, who hate coal and would love to see it gotten rid of, model coal to maintain a stable share of the power generation market (25-30% of total power) through 2040.

2: ""Solar/Nuclear/Wind/Fusion are going to take all the share and coal will stop being used!""

* No, see above. No one in the energy industry actually thinks this.

3: ""China is so polluted, they're not going to use anymore coal, that's the death knell for the industry!""

* Emerging markets matter a lot to some of the biggest players, but ARLP does not export coal. They sell exclusively into the U.S.

**Basic valuation**

ARLP is currently trading at 7.0x TTM P/E, and 8.0x forward. Even if there is no growth at all in earnings, the stock is still attractive at less than half the average multiple of the S&P. 

To put some numbers on it, a basic DCF shows the following (growth expressed as 5 years annualized, 12% discount rate, 12x exit multiple):

* Value assuming no growth: ~$60, almost 100% upside
* Value assuming 10% unit growth: ~$100, 3x upside
* Value assuming -10% units &-15% pricing: ~$32, no change

**Thesis**

The company is a good trade even without unit growth or improved coal pricing, but there are two factors that make me believe we'll see both:

1: The competition is in the shitter right now.

* 4 of the top 5 U.S. coal producers are losing (a lot) of money every quarter, and none of them are expected to turn a profit next year. They are highly levered, and some are getting dangerously close to tripping the covenants on their debt.

* Newly passed regulations favor the type of coal that ARLP produces (due to its position in the Illinois Basin) at the direct expense of the certain competitors. In fact, I've been told that as many as 50% of the mines in certain regions of Appalachia are currently not profitable, and are only continuing to be operated because it would cost more to shut them down that to keep them running. This is unsustainable, and ARLP is well poised to pick up the slack, having just purchased a large new swath of reserves contiguous to their current operations. 

2: Coals most serious competition is natural gas, but rig counts are falling and there's a good chance that a lot of supply will be coming offline as quickly depleting shale wells aren't renewed given current abysmal O&G pricing.

**Evidence and additional assurances**

With that highly condensed version of the thesis, let's move on to a bit of evidence, and some other key bits of information that provide some comfort:

Exhibit 1: ARLP has already made an agreement to acquire equipment and potentially contracts from Patriot Coal, who is drastically curtailing operations to try and stave off bankruptcy. Patriot is a spinoff of the largest U.S. coal producer, Peabody, that contains their unionized mines and the pension liabilities that go with them (which is currently the subject of a lawsuit). This shows that the beginnings of failure are already happening.

Exhibit 2: There have been a number of announcements related to supply cuts by major producers, and ARLP as taken market share. 

Exhibit 3: According to EIA data, ARLP has a far better contracting position, with a majority of their supply being contracted for between 1 and 3 years out. Their main competitors are heavily weighted towards contracts that expire much sooner. 

Comfort 1: ARLP has a stellar long term track record (especially compared to other coal companies), and a widely lauded management team that's been in place for decades. 

Comfort 2: As stated, the majority of ARLP's supply is already under mid to long term contracts.

Comfort 3: ARLP has far less debt than the competition, and has room to add more if needed.

Comfort 4: Due to its location, ARLP has great access to all three major types of transportation: rail, barge, and truck. Others do not share their level of access and flexibility on transportation.

***

I would encourage anyone that's interested to dig into the EIA data. There's so much there that you can work with to prove out the points I've laid out above. I've done a lot of work with it, as well as EPA forecasts, transportation costs, mine and plant level models, and talking to management, that's all lead to my conviction on the investment. I hope this encourages a few of you guys to take a look beyond the headlines, or at least that it was an interesting read.

1) Should I use the FTSE100, FTSE 250 or FTSE all share indexes as my proxies for the overall market? I guess the All Share index captures all listed companies but the firms I'm looking at are either FTSE100 or FTSE250 and I've gotten some somewhat different figures depending on what index I use as my proxy.

3) For the risk free rate I've used the yield on 10 year government gilts. Is this a good thing to go off of? And should I use the latest available yields or the average yield over some time period (say for example 5 years if I'm calculating my beta off of 5 years of data)

First of all, I am quite new to reddit and so far I mostly read passively in this subbredit. I hope that I posted this in the right place and that my questions are appropriate for this subreddit :-) 

I am a 25 years old master student in economics and finance at a European University and currently looking for a topic for my master thesis. I am highly interested in the field of value investing and would like to write my thesis in this field of research. By doing that I hope to get some deeper insights into value investing, read some of the classic books in that field (“the intelligent investor” etc.)  and that I can also cover and research something “new” in my thesis. 

The reason I write this post here is that I hope to get some inputs and suggestions for **topics in Value Investing that are currently relevant and could be interesting for research**. I am familiar with the basics and the investment philosophy of value investing, but I am not very up-to-date with current issues and developments in value investing today. 


**So I have this main question: 
Do you have any research idea in the field of value investing that I could use as a starting point for a master thesis? I don’t expect to get a final topic here, I am just happy if I get some inputs that make me think and wake my interest.**


**Some background information to the thesis and me:**

-Professors normally don’t give you a predetermined topic, so I need to develop it myself

-Thesis should be 60-100 pages long

-Thesis needs to have a quantitative part where I analyze something “new” / I can’t just summarize existing research; I need to contribute something new to the research myself

-Even though there is a quantitative part I try to keep this one “simple”, which means I would prefer if I can do it in Excel (preferably not Stata or Mathlab because I am not familiar with this programs)

-I would really like to learn more about valuation methods in Value investing and the investment part of this topic while writing my thesis. Nevertheless, I am quite open and flexible regarding the topic and I am interested in any aspect of value investing.

t3_33zgpd,Where to get info/resources on foreign index ETFs?,"Hi,

I have some money I want to put in the market, rather than just leave it in a savings account. The problem is I feel like the North American market is overpriced, which leads me to believe that putting it in an index right now would have small upside and a larger downside. I know it doesn't matter in the long run, but I'm most likely going to need this money in 2-3 years. So I'm looking to buy index funds in markets I feel are undervalued. I'm thinking parts of Europe.

That being said, I want to make an informed decision, and want to know where I can find a ton of info on ETFs in general, on measuring country risk, the impact certain political events may have on the market (specifically which events would cause the market to overreact), etc.

I'm in the process of reading a bunch of books on valuation and security analysis in general, but I'm not confident enough in my abilities as yet to actually buy individual stocks. In the meantime, while I continue to school myself, I'd rather be earning something decent on my investment, which is why I'm looking for index ETFs that follow certain countries. I'm not afraid of learning, so feel free to throw a couple book recommendations my way if that's the best and/or most efficient way to go about it.

t3_35hfkn,The use of cash flow,"Hey there,

Being a 17 year old beginner, my analysis of firms is based on the 'teachings' from the II, which I have built upon (hopefully improved)*. I now assess firms on many different quantitative and qualitative metrics, but still based on the II. 

However, I feel like there is a gaping hole in my assessment as I make no reference or use of cash flow. Throughout the II, cash flow is barely mentioned (and mostly in comments by Mr. Zweig). 

However, I believe it is important. I am currently researching about its use to answer my question, but I would love it if you could please tell me how and why it is necessary to analyse it, and how one ought to do so.

t3_35mjkh,Penman: Accounting for Value - Exhibit 4.3,"I'm having a hard time replicating his figures in Exhibit 4.3 (pg 88 in my copy), specifically the residual operating income for the levered company.  I want to be sure I completely understand his math here so I don't mistake an important concept in his analysis...  Thanks in advance for any help to my tedius question!  Please let me know if you need any more info, I'll be happy to oblige!

For the levered company: Year 1, the rate of return for operations is 12.50%.  The financing component of the debt hikes the rate of return on equity to (ROCE) to 25%, as it should.  I'm with him there.

The residual operating income is shown to be ~~$3.00~~ $2.00.  And this is where I'm hitting a snag.  In that section, he advises raising the required return rate to 15% from 10% to account for risk added by the introduction of debt to the firm's capital structure.  However, in using the 15% figure, I receive a negative residual operating income result per the below formula:  

Residual Operating Income = Operating income.Year1 - (Req Rate of Return * Operating Assets.Year0)

10.00 - (15% * 80) = 10 - 12 = -2.00

Which, in my limited understanding so far, makes sense.  If the RoR for Operations (12.50%) is less than the required return of 15%, then there wouldn't be any residual income to speak of, thus the -2.00 answer.

The only way I arrive at his answer of [positive] $2.00 across the board is if I resort back to the required return of 10% previously used for the unlevered company.  Which again makes sense because then the company is able to earn a return in excess of the required rate...

Adding to my confusion, in calculating the value of operations for the levered firm, he uses the following calculation, note the inclusion of a 10% rate rather than 15%: 

Operating Assets.Year0 + Residual Operating Income.Year1/(Required Return Rate - Growth Estimate)

$80 + 2/10% = $100  

Is there something I'm missing here?  A concept I'm not fully understanding?  For the levered firm, when he breaks things out for equity value, he uses 15%, but when he looks at operating income and operating value, he seems to revert back to 10%.  Perhaps there's a reason why he calcs operations at 10%, even for a levered firm? Thanks again!

I googled that topic but the results are not really satisfying.
The only alternative way I see to find cigar butts is to really get all symbols that are traded (otcmarkets.com) and check every single stock. A semi-comfortable way would be to use a page like gurufocus.com to quickly check the financial statements of every symbol. But here as well the website doesn't have all symbols in store. The only comprehensive way is to check the latest fillings (10K/Q) of every single symbol. But that of course means an absolute time consuming and inefficient way to dig through all the stocks. It might be a mission impossible while having a steady job.

Now i know im getting a little crazy here, thinking that some corporate wig is combing /securityanalysis for business decisions, but shoot even if i dont monetarily profit from these astute business decisions i.e. marvel buying movie rights then producing movies for cult-like consumers that will pay their first child to see this stuff happen...at least if this occurs i will increase my utility.

A question on my mind is when is the current tech boom phase over?  By that I mean, when do money losing companies that claim to have established competitive advantages have to put up or shut up with profits (or at least demonstrate the ability to create profits by reducing CAPEX, Amazon), to keep investor's confidence?  

I've heard most of the mainstream arguments: mainly thoughts about why businesses today can quickly create new markets, or disrupt and capture old markets. I've read most of what Marc Andreessen, possibly the most optimistic sane man alive, and his sidekicks have written.  I'm wondering, what happens when ""move fast and break things"" as the mantra of Silicon Valley turns into, oh crap, they expect some greater certainty of profits and are no longer willing to invest in uncertainty...

t3_3dn3iy,PM mining stocks are near 12 year lows. Time to buy?,"Reposted from /r/investing: www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3d9hfb/pm_mining_stocks_are_near_12_year_lows_time_to_buy/

Remarkably, gold and silver prices have been hammered in the last several weeks despite the turmoil in Greece and Chinese markets. In addition to a decrease in spot prices, PM mining indexes are nearing 12 year lows as investors flee mining stocks. Many miners are the same price as they were when gold was $500.

Assuming you are bullish on gold, this certainly seems like the time to become invested if you aren't already. I'm looking for some low cost producers right now that are able to weather bearish prices long term or indefinitely. Two I've already come across are Yamana (AUY) and Sprott (SII). Yamana has several low cost mines and also gets 30% of its revenue from the copper it gets as a by product. Sprott is an asset manager that specializes in commodities like gold and silver. It's managed to keep good earnings with it's asset management business and makes loans to mining companies in bad need of credit. In addition to high interest rates, Sprott also collects warrants from the miners to buy stock and would make a killing if the market rebounds.

Anyone else have any good miners or gold tied companies you're looking at?

 Financially solid salmon producer with strong management in place

 Good and sustainable dividend yield (currently yielding ~3%) 

 Several potential catalysts in place

 Upside of 20% based on DAOE model

 **Bakkafrost**

 Bakkafrost is a Faroese salmon producer listed on the Millennium Oslo Stock Exchange (from here on “OSE”). It trades on the US OTC board under the ticker ”BKFKF”. Bakkafrost is the largest and only public traded salmon producer on the Faroe Islands and offers a wide range of different salmon products including whole, gutted salmon, value added products and fish-meal, -oil and -feed (FOF). Bakkafrost produced 44.013 tons of gutted salmon and 85.724 FOF in 2014. 

 Bakkafrost owns six hatcheries, 19 farming sites, five wellboats, three harvesting plants, two VAP plants and an FOF plant. The current investment plan started in 2013 and is planned to add another wellboat (delivered July 2015), another hatchery (expected to be completed in Q2 2016) and a merged harvest/VAP plant (expected to be up and running in 2016). 
Bakkafrost is fully vertically integrated. The current (2014) company structure can be seen below (Havsbrún is the FOF plant).

 [Figure 1 – Bakkafrost company structure](http://i.imgur.com/bXQhV2j.png)

 Below is a quick historical overview of Bakkafrost’s evolution from a small, family owned company to a successful, public company.  

 **1968** - Bakkafrost was founded by the two brothers Hans and Roland Jacobsen. The early Bakkafrost was mainly engaged in catching and processing of herring. 

 **1986** - Production of farmed salmon and smolts (young salmons) began. 

 **1995** - The first salmon value-added-product (VAP) factory was built and the production capacity of VAP products was increased in 1999-2001. Bakkafrost continued to grow both through M&A activity in the early 2000’s. 

 **2008** - Bakkafrost started merger talks with Vestlax (another salmon producer). 

 **2010** - The merger went through making Bakkafrost the largest fish farming company in the Faroe Islands with 55% of the country’s salmon production. Bakkafrost went public in 2010. 

 **2011** - Bakkafrost acquired Havsbrún, an FOF plant. This acquisition made Bakkafrost fully vertically integrated – from the production of FOF all the way to production of VAP and sales. Being fully vertically integrated, Bakkafrost has complete oversight over all the critical production points. This helps insure a high quality product and full traceability. 

 **2013** - Bakkafrost announced an ambitious 5-year investment plan to make the onshore operation more efficient, to increase organic growth and to reduce the biological risk.

 **2014** - The best financial result ever was reached in part because of the Russian import ban on Norwegian salmon. Bakkafrost is currently being led by the son of Hans Jacobsen, Regin Jacobsen who has been the CEO for over 30 years. Bakkafrost was named OSE second best mid-cap company in 2014. 

 Note: Bakkafrost reports financial numbers in DKK (Danish Kroner) but is listed on the OSE and trades in NOK (Norwegian Kroner). Conversions between the two currencies will be made throughout the analysis at a rate of DKKNOK = 0,8225.

 **Brief industry overview**

 The salmon industry is composed of producers from many different countries spread out over the globe. The biggest producers are located in Canada, Chile, The Faroe Islands, Norway, Scotland and the United Kingdom where the biological conditions for salmons are optimal.

 [Figure 2 - Harvest volume by country](http://i.imgur.com/4PK1lYH.png)

 Back in the day salmon was mostly caught in the wild. Nowadays salmon –especially the Atlantic kind - is primarily farmed. The change has been driven by increased global demand combined with limited expansion capabilities in the wild due to fishing regulations, quotas and biological restraints. Farming salmon as opposed to catching them in the wild has the advantages that it gives greater control over the production, easier catching/ transportation and better disease control. 

 [Figure 3 - Wild vs Farmed by volume](http://i.imgur.com/C9cYo1l.png)

 Salmon is most often sold and bought in the spot market(s) or on longer term contracts with a price based on the spot price. The historical price can be seen below. Note the trending nature of the price but with large short-term volatility. 

 [Figure 4 - Salmon spot price - 25 and 50 MA](http://i.imgur.com/1n7lPBS.png)

 The spot price is driven by the balance between supply and demand (obviously) which is affected by several factors. The supply is affected by political intervention such as regulations/quotas, new investments in farms and equipment and biological/geographical factors such as diseases and weather conditions. Some of the factors driving the demand are global wealth growth, global population growth and focus sustainability (salmon farming is far more environment friendly than classic creature farming). Note that the key demand drivers are primarily megatrends.
 
 The salmon farming industry is near maximum farming/biological capacity and increasing the capacity requires large capital expenditures to new farms, processing plants, well-boats etc. As a result the global supply is expected to increase 4-5% in 2015 and 2-3% in 2016. The expectation is a yearly 3% supply increase until 2020. A balanced market with no change in spot price seems to be reached with a global supply growth of 9% per year. This strongly suggests that we will see salmon prices continue on its long-term climb in the coming years. 

 In August 2014 Russia imposed an import ban on European salmon. This created a major supply vacuum in the Russian market and enabled non-EU salmon producers to sell their fish at a premium. Bakkafrost has been a major beneficiary of this development. At the moment the ban looks to be standing as long as the situation is tense between Russia and the Western world.

 **Recent share price development**

 The chart below shows the 52-week development in Bakkafrost’s share price.

 [Figure 5 – 52 week share price](http://i.imgur.com/U7qyihS.png)

 The overall trend has been upwards mainly attributed to great financial results and the Russian situation. In the period October 2014 to April 2015 we saw some consolidation and falling share prices mainly attributable to falling/consolidating salmon spot prices. After the Q1 results reported on the 12th May we saw a strong upward movement in the price as a result of the great financial results achieved in the first quarter (it was the single best quarter in the company’s history). 

 **Management and shareholders**

 Regin Jacobsen is the CEO of Bakkafrost (1982-present day). He holds almost 4.5 million Bakkafrost shares worth over 100 million US dollars. This equals 9.2% of the total outstanding shares. His mother Oddvør Jacobsen owns 9.4% of the outstanding shares. In total the Jacobsen family owns 18.6% of the outstanding shares. The large insider ownership secures a strong alignment of shareholder’s and management’s interest. Other insiders own 0.4% of the outstanding shares. There is no option salary program in Bakkafrost and thus no (potential) dilution of the shareholder’s interest in the company except – of course – from any future equity issuance. 
 
 Regin Jacobsen has transformed the small family owned business to the Faroe Islands’ biggest and one of the world’s most successful salmon producers (looking at profit margins). He won a price for being the best CEO of a mid-cap company listed on the OSE in 2014. Salmon analysts have called the current management team the world’s best Atlantic salmon management team. 

 Reading the management’s letter to shareholders and listening to the conference calls, it is clear that the management has a long term focus. The long term focus is seen at large in Bakkafrost’s ambitious long-term investment plan.

 Having a strong management team combined with no potential dilution and a long term focus is a big bonus in my opinion. On top of these qualities it gives me faith in the company’s future prospect to know that the CEO (and family) has a lot of skin in the game. 

 After the Jacobsen family, JP Morgan is the biggest shareholder and owns 7.8% of the outstanding shares through five different subsidiaries. 

 **Products, customers and geography**

 Bakkafrost is engaged in the production and selling of fresh/frozen fish, VAP’s and FOF. 

 FOF is produced at Havsbrún. The major part of the produced feed is used in Bakkafrost’s own farming segment. Only 20 % (17537 ton out of a total production of 85724 ton - FY 2014) of the produced feed is sold externally to other fish (salmon) producers. The FOF business is generally highly volatile due to underlying volatility in the raw products (fish leftovers and/or different plant parts) going into the production of FOF. The Q1 EBITDA margin of 30,53% in the FOF segment is not sustainable and is related to very favorable raw material cost at the end of 2014. In earlier years the EBITDA margin has averaged around 10-15%. Bakkafrost uses a higher content of fish oil in its feed than the average in the fish feed industry. This makes the production of feed slightly costlier but results in salmons with higher fat (omega 3) content. Feed cost is one of the largest expenses in salmon farming and the FOF plant provides some stability regarding prices. 

 Whole gutted salmon (or head on gutted – HOG for short) is sold at spot prices to fish markets/other wholesalers. Selling salmon at a volatile spot price gives a somewhat volatile revenue and income stream. Bakkafrost has historically achieved nice margins in this segment.

 VAP’s is sold on longer term contracts to retailers and wholesalers. The prices on the contracts are based on the forward price in the salmon markets as opposed to the spot price. VAP contracts are 6-12 month in length and given the fixed price, provides a more predictable and stable income than the fresh/frozen segment. The EBIT margin achieved in the VAP segment is considerably lower and more volatile than in the fresh segment. 

 In 2014 45% of the harvested volume was used in the VAP segment while 55% was sold whole and gutted. The long term goal is to sell 40-50% of the harvested volume as VAP products. The new VAP factory will help achieve this goal as harvested volume increases in the future. 

 Bakkafrost is located favorably to export their products all over the globe. Historically, most of the Bakkafrost fish has been sold in the EU and USA. The fattier salmon taste obtained by fish feed with higher fat content is a big hit in the US. Asia has taken an increased amount of Bakkafrost fish in recent years mainly for use in sushi.  

 In 2014 a higher fraction of the fish has gone to Russia as a result of the supply vacuum following the ban on imported Norwegian salmon. Bakkafrost salmon can be sold at a premium in Russia as a result of this situation. As long as the tension between Russia and the Western world remains (and the import ban is intact), Bakkafrost is expected to sell a larger than average volume to the Russian market. 

 **Competitive edge**

 Bakkafrost operates in a commodity-like industry where true competitive advantages are somewhat rare. Bakkafrost, however, do enjoy some competitive advantages which are pushing their margins higher than industry average. One of the competitive advantages is permanent and related to the geographically location of Bakkafrost’s operations. Another one is temporary and related to the Russian situation. The last is related to the current management team and is long-term but not permanent.  

 Bakkafrost has a permanent lower feed cost because of the biological conditions in the Faroe Islands (more stable temperature throughout the year among others). As mentioned earlier the feed cost is one of the main costs in producing salmon. Having a lower feed cost provides Bakkafrost with a nice competitive advantage. This competitive advantage is well-protected through a limited number of farming licenses and Faroe regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 20% of any salmon farmer.

 Bakkafrost is not affected by the Russian import ban on European salmon. As a result Bakkafrost has acquired a sizeable chunk of the Russian salmon market and can sell its salmon at a premium compared to the spot price. This is a temporary, but possibly long standing, competitive edge. 

 On top of these two competitive edges, Bakkafrost’s management is highly skilled and focused on efficiency throughout the organization. Bruce Greenwald has stated that companies operating in commodity(-like) businesses need to have a strong focus on being the lowest-cost producer and operating as efficiently as possible. I would consider the skill of the current management team another competitive edge.

 **Risks**

 Bakkafrost is exposed to several company and industry specific risks. 

 A lower salmon price is one of the major risks faced by Bakkafrost and other salmon producers. Both top line and bottom line is heavily influenced by the salmon price. A long time with low/declining salmon prices will push the revenue and earnings down and hurt Bakkafrost.

 Since feed cost is one of the major costs associated with salmon farming, a rising feed cost will have a negative impact on Bakkafrost’s profit if it isn’t followed by a higher spot price. Feed cost is influenced by commodity prices which are highly volatile and hard to predict. This risk is somewhat mitigated by Bakkafrost’s ownership of an FOF plant. 

 Diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites such as sea lice can hurt or kill the salmons and is another risk involved in salmon farming. Overall Bakkafrost has a good control with its salmon production and disease-risk has been managed tightly. Bakkafrost is actively engaged in research aimed at controlling these potential problems and is currently working on a solution to the sea lice problem by employing sea lice eating fishes (so called cleaner fish) in the salmon farms. The new well boat delivered in July is also capable of treating sea lice infected fish through a fresh water treating facility. 

 Bakkafrost is enjoying higher margins as a result of the Russian situation. If Russia removes the import ban on salmon from Norway and other EU countries the salmon supply to the Russian market will skyrocket. Bakkafrost will be hurt somewhat by this as they can no longer sell their fish at a premium. 
Overall Bakkafrost is a fairly risky business. This will be reflected in the required return used in my valuation model. 

 **Financials**

 In this section I will take a closer look at Bakkafrost’s financial statements. Some of my comments will be about my own and/or the managements expectations for the future. This will be used in the later forecast needed to make a valuation. 

 [Figure 6 - Income statement percentage change](http://i.imgur.com/jcOmxxN.png)

 [Figure 7 - Income statement common size](http://i.imgur.com/enbzumL.png)

 Looking at the income statement we see the numbers of a profitable and growing company. 

 Revenue has been growing 34,49% per year since 2010 which is attributable to a larger harvest volume (44013 ton gw in 2014 against 21626 in 2010) and a higher realized price per ton gw. We saw some slowdown in the revenue growth from 2013-2014 but I expect the growth to accelerate in the coming years as a result of the expected higher spot prices and the results of the investment plan. Especially the plan of reducing growing times of salmons from 18 months to 14-15 months gradually over the next 3 should provide a nice boost on the top-line in the coming years (guided at ~4% per year over the next three years from this development alone).

 The most notable thing in the operating expenses section is that expenses have grown considerably since 2010. This shows us that Bakkafrost is not a company that can grow without investing in more raw material purchases, higher expenses to salaries, more PP&E (leading to higher depreciation charges) etc. Even though expenses have grown, they have only grown at (roughly) the same pace as revenue. This means that we have (roughly) the same operating margin today as we did in 2010. Given the high operating margin back then, I consider this a great result and it shows the management’s dedication to efficiency and meaningful growth. 

 The new harvest/VAP plant being built as part of the investment plan is expected to reduce operating expenses by 70-90 million DKK per year from 2017 and onwards. Together with the other parts of the investment plan, this makes me believe that Bakkafrost will keep on having expenses under tight control while revenue is growing nicely. 

 The fair value adjustment on biomass and (provisions for) onerous contracts are both IFRS-related non-cash adjustments made to the operational result every year. The fair value adjustment on biomass is an adjustment to reflect the current value of Bakkafrost’s biomass given changes in spot price and other changing (biological) conditions. The “onerous contracts”-item is related to the long-term VAP contracts and other contracts related to raw materials. A negative “onerous contracts”-post means that Bakkafrost is locked in contracts where the economic benefit will be lower than the cost of fulfilling the contract. In 2014 we saw a reversal of 2012 and 2013’s negative posts because conditions changed and the negative impacts were not realized as expected. As seen, both fluctuates and are very difficult to forecast with the information provided by Bakkafrost in the financial statements. 

 “Income from associates” is Bakkafrost’s share in the income of its associates P/f Pelagos (30% ownership), P/f Salmon Proteins (76% ownership), P/f Keldan (25% ownership), Hanstholm Fiskemelsfabrik (40% ownership) and P/f Faroe Farming (49% ownership). I expect these companies to attribute with a small, positive result in the future if salmon prices rise. 

 “Listing costs”, “badwill related to the acquisition of Havsbrún”, “acquisition costs” and “loss from sale of subsidiary” are non-recurring charges. The first two were one-time charges related to the listing on the OSE and the acquisition of Havsbrún. The last two are related to Bakkafrost’s acquisitions and sale of divisions/related companies. Bakkafrost has mentioned that they will make meaningful acquisitions/take stakes in other salmon-related companies if it is at good terms and in line with the overall strategy. 

 The financial income is related to the interests earned on Bakkafrost’s big cash position and any dividends received from associated companies. 

 The interest expense is related to the coupons on the bond issue, interest on the revolving credit facilities and interests on the instalment loan (all three described in greater detail under the balance sheet section). Note that the current interest expense is covered many times over by the operational earnings (and operational cash flow). 
The net currency effect is related to the currency gain on the 500 million NOK bond. 

 The currency gain comes as a result of the sharp decline in the NOKDKK pair (Bakkafrost reports numbers in DKK). A currency-swap is in place which swaps the NOK to DKK. This means that the currency gain/loss is counteracted by a loss/gain on the currency swap. This counter effect is reported under comprehensive earnings. 

 The Faroe Islands have a nominal tax rate of 18% and a special resource tax of 4,5% from 2014 and onwards. The effective tax rate was 28,03% in 2014 due to earlier deferred taxes. I expect the effective tax rate to remain above the nominal tax rate for some time due a big deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. I expect the effective tax rate to be 22,5% in the longer run. 

 There are no non-controlling interests taking part in the profits of Bakkafrost. Furthermore there is no potential dilution from options as they are not part of the employer/executive salary package. The only potential dilution is from potential future increase of equity. Later in the cash flow section I will explain why I don’t see new equity being issued in the near future. 

 When looking at the income statement it is worth noting that in 2014 the margins were higher than the 2010-2013 average margins. As stated earlier this is attributable to the Russian situation. But it is also worth noting that the 2010-2013 margins were high even without having the effect of the Russian import ban. This shows us that Bakkafrost enjoys the gains from the Russian situation but is in no way dependent on it to survive or produce above average margins. 

 Condensing the income statement into one word I would call it “great”. 

 [Figure 8 - Balance sheet percentage change](http://i.imgur.com/mEtoqwx.png)

 [Figure 9 - Balance sheet common size](http://i.imgur.com/GGk1E1v.png)

 Looking at the balance sheet we see the numbers of a financially solid company.
 
 The “Intangible assets”-item is the first and in my opinion the most interesting item in the balance sheet. Bakkafrost writes that: “Intangible assets comprise primarily the fair value of acquired farming licenses. No licenses in the North region are recorded with a value in the Bakkafrost accounts.” This could mean that we’re looking at a sizeable hidden asset since a license to farm salmon in a given area is by no means worthless.

 First of all we have to split up the farming sites (and their farming license) into a Farming West and a Farming North region. Bakkafrost does not disclose which farming sites belong to Farming West and which ones belong to Farming North. After many hours of searching I found a semi-outdated site which lists all the Faroe fishing licenses and the owners. On figure 10 we see all Bakkafrost’s farming sites marked with circles. The yellow ones are listed on the site as belonging to “Bakkafrost Farming North” while the green ones are listed as belonging to “Bakkafrost Farming West”. The farming sites represented by red circles are listed as either belonging to just “Bakkafrost Farming” or another company from which Bakkafrost has later acquired the license. The blue line on figure 10 is my best guess at a division between the two regions. 

 [Figure 10 - Bakkafrost farming locations](http://i.imgur.com/WRwYcfR.png)

 This means that we have between eight and ten farming licenses which are recorded at a value of 0. To put a value on this hidden asset I’ll take a look at the value of the fishing licenses which are already on the balance sheet. 

 The intangible asset (worth 294,7 million DKK) is composed of at least six and up to nine farming licenses. To be conservative I’ll assume that this number is for all nine licenses potentially belonging to Bakkafrost Farming West. This means that each license is worth 294,7 million DKK / 9 = 32,7 million DKK per license. Therefore the eight to ten licenses located in the North region is worth between 261,6 and 327 million DKK. The market values Bakkafrost’s assets at 2,9 times assets. Using this as a guide, the hidden assets could be equal to 758,64-948,3 million DKK of additional market value. This is roughly 7%-9% of Bakkafrost’s current market cap. 
Given the uncertainty of the calculations made above I will not include the value of the hidden asset in my total business valuation. It is an area worthy of further research though and later on I will contact the management/IR department and ask them about it. 

 The total PP&E consists of all non-financial “hard assets” in Bakkafrost. This includes the hatcheries (six), farming sites (19), wellboats (five), harvesting plants (three), offices (various sales offices and the headquarter), processing plants (two), packaging plant (one), FOF plant (one), prepayments made for several hard assets in the investment plant and various other small PP&E assets such as computers, furniture etc. 

 Under the “Total non-current financial items” we have the “Investments in associated companies” and “Investments in stocks and shares” which consists of the stakes in the associated companies mentioned earlier. The long-term receivable is a minor item related to a long standing receivable with a customer. It is expected to be realized at the value stated on the balance sheet. 

 The total inventory consists of the biomass (equal to ~30% of the total assets) and other inventory. The biomass is valued at fair value and subject to an adjustment every year. The other inventory consists primarily of raw materials going into the FOF plant, packing material and semi-finished goods.

 The “total receivables”-item consists of accounts receivables and other receivables. Accounts receivables have grown far less than the total amount of assets which shows a tighter control with the account receivables. The other receivables are related to VAT, deposits for derivatives and receivables from the associated companies. 

 The cash and cash equivalent item is the bank deposits and other near-cash instruments such as short term bonds. Even with a high dividend and ambitious investment Bakkafrost has been able to build a big cash position (11,7% of total assets). I suspect that the cash position hasn’t been distributed as a dividend/buyback due to upcoming debt liabilities, future payments for the investment plan and to “buff up” the balance sheet in order to be able to withstand potential adverse industry/company specific developments. 

 Overall the total amount of assets has grown rapidly since 2010. The growth in total assets has been faster than the growth in equity because the total liabilities have been growing faster than the total assets. 

 The equity has been growing fast with no increase in the share capital. This is the result of high and fast growing comprehensive income. The equity/liabilities-ratio has been shrinking since 2010 due to new debt financing. The equity share is ~60% which I consider enough given the high amount of liquid assets, interest coverage ratio and quick ratio. 

 Long-term interest bearing liabilities (short- and long-term) consists of three different debt instruments which accounts for ~17,5% of the total equity and liabilities and 43,2% of the total liabilities. The first debt instrument is a 500 million NOK unsecured bond issued in 2013 with a five year tenor. The interest is NIBOR 3m + 4,15%. The currency has been swapped to DKK and the interest rate to CIBOR 3m due to primary exposure to DKK and EUR. The second debt instrument is an instalment loan of 500 million DKK obtained in 2011. It is payable with 25 million DKK each quarter (100 million DKK is listed as “short-term interested bearing debts”). The last debt instrument is a 600 million DKK (adjusted down to 553 million DKK after a sale of a subsidiary) overdraft facility fully payable in 2016.  

 As written earlier I suspect that the interest bearing debt is part of the reason why Bakkafrost has been building a big cash position. They have to pay back 653 million DKK in 2016, 100 million DKK (remainder of the instalment loan) in 2017 and 500 million NOK in 2018. Bakkafrost currently has 753 million DKK in available bank financing. 

 Bakkafrost has a sizeable deferred tax liability that – as noted under the income statement section – will keep the effective tax rate higher than the nominal tax rate for some time into the future. 

 The “derivatives”-item is an item related to different derivatives used in Bakkafrost. The two derivatives mentioned in the annual report are the currency-swap and the interest rate-swap related to the bond.

 In 2013 Bakkafrost decided to break the current liabilities into more sub-categories. “Trade payables” and “other current liabilities” took the place of “accounts payable and other debt” in 2013. These are small items related to bills waiting to be paid and other small, current liabilities not specified by Bakkafrost.

 In total, the amount of liabilities has been rising fast. It is however not alarming in my eyes since Bakkafrost generates huge amounts of cash through operations and have a lot of cash on hand to pay upcoming debts (see next section). 

 Overall the balance sheet and capital structure look solid to me. I do however want to keep a close eye on the development in the balance sheet when the big debt payments arrive because they arrive at a time where cash is needed for the investment plan. It should be no problem due to a high free cash flow (see next section) but it is always worth being on top of these sorts of things. 

 [Figure 11 - Cash flow statement](http://i.imgur.com/iy2Ttj4.png)

 Looking at the cash flow statement we see a flourishing company creating a solid stream of free cash flow.

 The cash flow from operations takes the operational EBIT and adds back all the non-cash charges made on the income statement such as the fair value adjustments to the biomass and depreciation charges. It has been growing very fast in the last years primarily attributable to the fast increase in operational EBIT.

 In the investment section we see the cash used in various investments. The most notable part is the massive use of money to buy or prepay PP&E. This is the result of the investment plan. Worth noting is that Bakkafrost still has a lot of money left after paying for the various investments. In other words, Bakkafrost has a high amount of free cash flow which is great. The high free cash flow points in the direction of no additional equity issuance in the near future and a high sustainability of the current dividend. 

 Looking at the financing section we see that Bakkafrost has acquired extra funding through the various debt instruments mentioned in the balance sheet section. One of the main cash drainers is the high (and historically fast growing) dividend being paid. The upcoming payment of 653 million DKK will be another major cash drainer next year but Bakkafrost should have no trouble with the payment given the high free cash flow and big cash position. When some of the current interest bearing debt has been payed of I could see Bakkafrost raise the dividend aggressively or initiate a buyback program due to the high free cash flow. 

 Overall the cash flow statement supports my conclusion regarding the income statement and balance sheet. The story being told by the financial statements is that we are looking at a great company. During my analysis I discovered no suspicious accounting. From the revenue recognition practices to the assumptions used to fair value the biomass and intangible assets, everything looks okay in my eyes.

 **Dividend policy**

 The dividend is currently at 6 DKK (payout ratio of 45%). The dividend policy is to payout 30-50% of the net income. Management has said that the investment plan will not change the dividend policy. 

 As written in the last section, Bakkafrost has a high free cash flow and therefore I consider the current dividend sustainable. 

 The current dividend gives a yield of 3%. Be advised that you MIGHT experience some dividend related tax troubles depending on your location. Personally, I have to send a letter to the Faroe tax authority every year to get a tax refund on the dividend. 

 [Figure 12 - EPS DPS and Payout ratio](http://i.imgur.com/qQcxtUG.png)

 **Competitors**

 The list of competitors is composed of the other seafood companies listed on the OSE. 

 **Austevoll Seafood** is the fourth largest company in the group with a market cap of 8,5 billion NOK. Austevoll is a diversified pelagic fishery based in Norway but with operations in Chile, Norway and Peru. 

 **Grieg Seafood** is the second smallest company in the group with a market cap of 2,9 billion NOK. Grieg Seafood is a salmon and trout producer based in Norway but with operations in Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. 

  **Lerøy Seafood Group** is the second largest company in the group with a market cap of 15,3 billion NOK. Lerøy Seafood Group is engaged in salmon farming and diversified seafood. 

  **Marine Harvest** is the largest company in the group with a market cap of 45,4 billion NOK. Marine Harvest offers a wide range of seafood. It is based in Norway but has operations in most of the major seafood countries. 

  **Norway Royal Salmon** is the third smallest company in the group with a market cap of 3,1 billion NOK. Norway Royal Salmon is a salmon and trout producer based in Norway. 

  **SalMar** is the third largest company in the group with a market cap of 14,6 billion NOK. SalMar is a salmon producer based in Norway. 

 **The Scottish Salmon Company** is the smallest company in the group with a market cap of 0,98 billion NOK. The Scottish Salmon company is a salmon producer based in Scotland. 


 To give you an idea about the relative ranking between these companies and Bakkafrost, I have chosen to compare them with the use of nine business metrics. Revenue and EBIT growth tells us something about how much the companies have grown in the recent past. EBIT margin and EBIT per kg gutted weight tells us something about how good the companies are at turning one dollar of revenue/one kg gutted fish into operating profit. ROIC and ROCE tells us something about how good the companies are at using their invested/employed capital optimal. Interest coverage and quick ratio tells us something about the companies’ financial strength. Lastly we have a dividend yield which is our direct yield of holding the investment. 

 [Figure 13 - Comparison on business metrics](http://i.imgur.com/OEprSLm.png)

 The top two in each metric is colored green and the bottom two is colored red. Looking at these business ratios, Bakkafrost is by far the best company of the group. It ranks as the best or second best in almost every ratio. In the two ratios where it doesn’t, it still has a solid position. A quick ratio of right around 2 (especially combined with the magnificent interest coverage) and a sustainable dividend yield just shy of 3% is not bad at all. 

 **Valuation**

 [Figure 14 – Relative valuation](http://i.imgur.com/g9tiOtg.png)

 Given that Bakkafrost is the best company in the comparison group (as measured by the nine business metrics) one might expect that Bakkafrost is valued relatively high compared to the others. But this is actually not the case. Looking at figure 14 we see that Bakkafrost is valued approximately in the middle of the group. It is neither cheap nor expensive measured on a relative basis. My earlier analysis points in the direction of a good future for Bakkafrost and the reasonable relative valuation could mean that we’re looking at a bargain.  

 To determine whether Bakkafrost is a bargain at the current price, I will use a Discounted Abnormal Operating Model (DAOE). This type of model is described in greater detail in “Financial Statements Analysis and Security Valuation” by Stephen Penman. It is somewhat expensive but I highly recommended it. 

 I will do a base case, optimist case (moderately optimistic, not “blue sky”) and pessimist case (moderately pessimistic, not “draconian”) valuation. The valuation will be based on a five year proforma statement for each case. The “cost of operations”/WACC is based on a “bottom up”-beta (Damodaran’s concept) with added industry specific risk. 

 The base case is built around average result from the investment plan and a moderate increase in salmon spot prices and harvest volumes

 [Figure 15 – Base case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/D4icNia.png)

 In the base case we get a fair value of 316,25 NOK per share. I consider the base case the most probable and assign it a probability of 60%. 

 The pessimist case is built on expectations of poor results from the investment plan, a moderate decrease in salmon spot prices and a constant harvest volume

 [Figure 16 – Pessimist case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/UW8ZxDa.png)

 In the pessimist case we get a fair value of 183,11 NOK per share. I consider the pessimist/optimist case the least probable and assign them both a probability of 20%.
The optimist case is built on high expectations for the investment plant and a solid increase in salmon spot prices and harvest volume

 [Figure 17 – Optimist case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/wCteyLe.png)

 In the base case we get a fair value of 395,72 NOK per share.

 Condensing the three cases into a single valuation I come up with a value of 305,5 NOK (0,60 * 316,25 NOK + 0,2 * 183,11 NOK + 0,2 * 395,72 NOK) per share. This value is 20,3% percent higher than the current price of 254 NOK. 

 **Catalysts**

 There are several different potential catalysts in the near future that can push Bakkafrost to my estimated fair value of 305,5 NOK.

 As written in the industry overview, salmon prices are expected to rise in the coming years as supply growth slows down. This is currently the biggest catalyst for Bakkafrost and I expect a strong rally as a result of great financial results if the higher spot price materializes as expected.  

 Chile is the second largest producer of salmon after Norway. The Chilean farming capacity has grown at an explosive rate in the last decade and quality/disease control has not been able to keep up with the growth. Therefore, news about adverse developments in the Chilean salmon/fishing industry such as disease outbreaks comes out every now and then. This kind of news pushes up the price of non-Chilean salmon farmers. Production problems in Chile act as a potential catalyst on non-Chilean farmers especially farmers (such as Bakkafrost) who can sell their fish to the Russian market with even less competition.

 The Russian situation is a joker in the Bakkafrost case. A step up (or prolongation) of the Russian conflict could act as a catalyst and push the stock price up but it could also hurt the investor sentiment and make investors more risk averse. 

 **Conclusion**

 Bakkafrost is a great company operating in an interesting industry which stands to benefit from limited supply growth in the short/mid-term and several megatrends in the long run. The management in place is as good as it gets and has been called the best salmon farming management team by analysts. 

 The gap up to my valuation of 305,5 NOK can be closed by several near-term catalysts. Bakkafrost is currently valued at a discount of 20,3% based on my valuation. Bakkafrost is not a deep value stock but rather a “good company at a fair price” kind of value opportunity. It is to some degree a play on the tension between Russia and the western world.

Thus, why does owner earnings ignore debt principal repayment? To me this is overstating the cash flows attributable to the equity holders by the amount of debt principal repaid in a year.   ",2,0.75,1439475738.0

t3_3gx4tr,Does Black Scholes still break in special situations (as Greenblatt suggested)?,"I just finished reading Joel Greenblatt's first book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius. Having studied the Black Scholes model at school, I always found it weird that using just historical volatility, current price and interest rates, you could fairly price an option while completely ignoring things that happen with businesses that are not reflected in such blunt measures as volatility. Joel Greenblatt sort of confirmed this oddity when he showed an example of how he bought options expiring in about a month just a couple of weeks after a special situation with the stock was going down. Obviously the Black Scholes model didn't take the existence of the special situation into account and so it pretty much broke in that situation.

While I would expect the BSM framework to still break down in special situations, I do however expect that the market would end up pricing the options correctly through supply and demand. So my question to you is that does the BSM framework still break down in special situations as Greenblatt suggested years ago in his book? Or has the market sort of wizened up after his book?",15,1.0,1439513854.0

I am new to this sub, and to the world of Value Investing / Security Analysis. I went through the sidebar and see a lot of books listed in Reading List. I already started reading The Intelligent Investor. Where should I go from there? Which books to read? Which websites / wikis to read? 

My background: I have read up and using the Boglehead style of investing. But craving for something more fundamental. Value investing seems like the right approach, but I want to read up more to evaluate for myself. I have not read quarterly reports for any company ever. I have dabbled in some stock buying, but based on intuition rather than any solid analysis.

I largely look at public equity markets and am a fundamental investor through and through. However, in recent times, it has become such a challenge to find undervalued stock that I'm of the sense that we are heading towards a bubble, if not already in one.

On this note, I'm hoping to diversify into commodities. I've got particular interest in gold and oil as I've heard the prices for both have a tendency to revert to the mean. However, my knowledge on commodities is marginal. 

What resources are suitable for me to understand more about commodity valuation from a fundamental perspective? (perhaps an analysis of supply and demand?)

3.  DOJ risk---stops the merger train
4.  DOJ risk---forces them to start reinvesting in R&D

Even though we were based in different time-zones (US, Canada, Singapore and Greece) and we have different backgrounds (portfolio manager, students and analysts) it seemed that we had a common language: value investing. It was really nice to debating overnight on ROEs, WACC calculations, moats etc. Literally, hundreds of lines have been written in Google Hangouts.
This project lasted almost 1 month. The in-depth understanding of the company's value chain had as a ""collateral benefit"" to understand the catalysts that affect the intrinsic value of the company. We have not finished our analysis but we are 95% there. From the very beginning, we have agreed to share with the community our outputs and let them decide if the company is a buy, hold or sell. There is still much to be done but we believe that our material is a good starting point for someone to see how a value investing research can be done and most importantly to share an advanced excel model.
Our hope is that another team will finish what we started by analysing a competitor or maybe improving the assumptions. We may have some mistakes on the data or the the formulas and we would appreciate it if you find any to drop us a PM on reddit.
But our real wish is to have similar projects from other teams where we would like to participate. In another post, we will share the tools that we have used and the process that we have followed and we would love to give you the keys of this blog to continue the writing.

This is a Long thesis on CarMax Inc., (KMX). 

The tl;dr version of the thesis is that currently KMX is only thought of as a growth company, but the specifics of their financing business actually makes the company a very compelling value investment as well due to the margin of safety provided by their business structure. Basically, the company is not as susceptible to volatility in the auto loan ABS market as their other competitors.

t3_3jropm,Investment Aphorisms,"""Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around?

Broadcasting is easy; retailing is the other extreme. If you had a network television station 50 years ago, you didn’t really have to invent or being a good salesman. The network paid you; car dealers paid you, and you made money.

But in retail you have to be smarter than Wal-Mart. Every day retailers are constantly thinking about ways to get ahead of what they were doing the previous day.

We would rather look for easier things to do. The Buffett grocery stores started in Omaha in 1869 and lasted for 100 years. There were two competitors. In 1950, one competitor went out of business. In 1960 the other closed. We had the whole town to ourselves and still didn’t make any money.

How many retailers have really sunk, and then come back? Not many. I can’t think of any. Don’t bet against the best. Costco is working on a 10-11% gross margin that is better than the Wal-Mart’s and Sams’. In comparison, department stores have 35% gross margins.

It’s tough to compete against the best deal for customers. Department stores will keep their old customers that have a habit of shopping there, but they won’t pick up new ones. Wal-Mart is also a tough competitor because others can’t compete at their margins. It’s very efficient."" - Buffett

""I'm very leery of tech companies that become value stocks. It just never seems to work."" - Chanos

""In the long run, valuation always matters, but don't short just on valuation. Is the business deteriorating? Does the company have a lot of debt? Our very best shorts historically have been stocks that appeared cheap, not expensive, because the business was deteriorating faster than investors were lowering their numbers."" - Chanos again


""As long as the story around the investment remains the same, the position should get bigger (regardless of how much the price goes down by).""  - Julian Robertson

For example: 'Say you are interested in a solid oak wooden table. The analyst could tell you that he had checked out the market for tables, evaluated the information, and come to the conclusion that the table was a good buy at $100 because it was well made, solidly built, and would not fall apart. This is the story. So you go to the shop, prepared to buy the table. And then, just as you are run- ning your hand over the table, a corner falls off. Well, now the seller is desperate to get rid of the broken table and is willing to sell it for $20. To the analyst, this seems like a steal. He sees an incredible opportunity to buy something for $20 that is really worth $100 and needs just a bit of fixing to get it there. But in Robertson’s eyes, the story is now flawed, and now he would say that you should want no part of the deal. How could something so well built, made of the finest oak, break? Robertson would say that more than the table is broken. The credibility of the re- search is now called into question. The story is broken; it is time to move on to something else.'

""How do you get into these great companies? One method is what I'd call the method of finding them small - get 'em when they're little. For example, buy Wal-Mart when Sam Walton first goes public and so forth. And a lot of people try to do just that. And it's a very beguiling idea. If I were a young man, I might actually go into it."" *

I downloaded company data for businesses registered in my City (a medium sized UK City). The information is limited because these are small private companies, so I took what I could and filtered it:

More than 6 years since incorporation to filter out very new businesses. 
More than 15% average return on net tangible assets during previous 3 years.
Less than 20% gearing. 
More than £10m turnover. 

Manually filtering the list further and doing a bit of research online, I can see several seemingly successful local businesses. Aside from watching for some of them to go public, I was wondering if anybody could share a creative idea or two for investing in these businesses? For example, are there secondary markets for the shares of small unquoted UK businesses? 

If investing directly is difficult, what other options are out there? I can think of a few private equity firms that look to acquire small businesses, but they tend to have a small number of deep pocketed backers. Is anybody here buying small local businesses? 

My background is in buying distressed residential real estate (I operate a small fund). I am looking at this area because my real estate niche is becoming too competitive and I want to find about other ways to earn reasonable rates of return in my local area. 

Thank you for any advice you can share.

t3_3kefzl,Interesting MLP: MCEP,"Note: I'm sharing info. on MCEP neither as a buy nor a short recommendation, but as simply sharing interesting information.

I first took a look at MCEP last week when I noticed several seemingly positive attributes. However, after having dug down a little, I found some not-so-positive attributes as well. To keep things brief, I'll list both segments and I would love to read your thoughts on the partnership.

Positives Found:
• 5-Year EPS growth of 74.83%
• Tangible Book Value growth of 26.90%.
• Currently selling under tangible book.
• ROE 5-Year average of 48.03% and ROIC 5-Year average of 24.37%.
• Insider ownership of 5%.
• Recent insider buying.

Negatives Found:
• Returns based on employment of high leverage and relatively high oil prices.
• Two executives carrying same family name.
• Conducting business with companies owned by same people (e.g. Mid-Con Energy Operating)
• Conflict of interest of relevant parties, which was explicitly stated in the annual report.",9,0.91,1441893664.0

t3_3kkd14,Valuing Wynn,"In the midst of the bad news from Macau, I've started looking at Wynn and LVS. At what price would Wynn be good value?

My basic idea is that gambling is not going to disappear. The desire of people to gamble is very high. For example in stocks, day trading comes very close to gambling. People like to gamble. If there’s a football game, especially if it’s boring, you’ll enjoy it more if you bet a few bucks. The human propensity to gamble is huge.

Wynn is led by Steve Wynn, who is a proven owner-operator and has best track record out of all the casino owners. He's been in the gaming industry for 30 years. He has vision - he sees what other people do not see. And Wynn the company is the best run gaming company in the world, with multiple drivers for growth in the medium term - recovery in Macau (timing looking uncertain), Boston (probably from 2018 onwards, depending on how long it takes to get approved + get the casino built), Japan (probably for the longer term / 2022 onwards). What sort of multiple would you pay for a company like this? 20x? 30x?

Wynn Macau's revenue attributed to Wynn was 3.8 bn for 2014, and Wynn's Vegas operations revenues for 2014 was 1.6bn. Wynn's overall profit margins was around 18% for 2014. If we value Wynn Macau at nothing (which is insane), and put a 20x multiple on earnings from their Vegas operations (around 295m), we would be valuing that at around 5.9bn. Company is trading for ~7bn right now. It traded at 7bn back in 2005 when it had $0 in revenues and all it had in assets were: (1) the new Wynn Las Vegas resort; (2) an annex to Wynn Las Vegas, the $1.4 billion Encore, on which ground will be broken this summer; (3) a $700 million casino scheduled to open in the Chinese territory of Macau in late 2006; (4) a recently submitted bid for a license to build a casino in Singapore.

Would love to hear your thoughts. Is a 20x multiple too high? Are there any real liquidity concerns? Thoughts on the gaming industry in general?

t3_3ku0z3,Are the fundamentals for NFLX changing?,"Let me preface this post by saying that I have not done a full read of NFLX's 10k, so forgive any ignorance or poor understanding on my part. 

For a long time I think a lot of people's problem with NFLX has been that while their customer acquisition and subscription model has been relatively successful,  their implied valuation has not been justifiable due to poor content acquisition economics. This meaning that NFLX has had to pay enormous licensing and rights fees to provide their streaming content which *they don't own*. As a result, FCF has not been there (TTM is -$543mm). 

What got me thinking about a shift in their overall business model was over the week as I finished up their new Original series Narcos. It always struck me as impressive that every Netflix Original series has seemed to do very well - House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, and Narcos to name a few. However, when I looked into it I saw that Netflix is the publisher of well over a dozen originals that range from documentaries to children's shows. 

So this leads me to ask the following questions about NFLX's business that I thought we could brainstorm on:

* What is the ROIC on publishing original content? 

* Is the mix of original content greater than, or could it eventually exceed, the amount of licensed content NFLX streams?

* What potential effect could a greater mix of original content have on customer acquisition economics vs. competing streaming services such as Hulu?

Or maybe this has already been noticed by investors, priced in, and I'm just late to the party haha. 

What are everyone's thoughts?

t3_3l4ojn,WYNN Revisited,"I thought I would post a new thread on WYNN since I am going to throw out some numbers to hang a value on Wynn. These numbers are rough, but it is a starting point. Wynn Resorts owns 72% of Wynn Macau, 100% of Wynn Las Vegas, and 100% of Wynn America (Boston). WYNN has 101.5 million shares outstanding.

&nbsp;

Macau:  
 - Last quarter the Macau property did $175M EBITDA. Annualized that is $700M.  
 - The new property will be in a better location and should do more EBITDA, but it will probably cannibalize the old one for some time. Let's assume that the two properties do $1.4B of EBITDA after the dust settles. 
 - Im estimating that the Macau box will need to increase debt load to finish off the Cotai property and will have around $4B of net debt after the property is complete.  
 - Assume Macau is worth 12x EBITDA  
 - $16,800M Enterprise Value ($1.4B * 12)  
 - $4000M Net Debt  
 - $12,800 Equity Value  
 - x72%  
= $9216M Equity Value to WYNN or $90.8/share

&nbsp;

Las Vegas:  
 - The LV box did $475M EBITDA LTM  
 - Assume it is worth 11x  
 - $5225 Enterprise Value  
 - $5200M of Debt at that Box  
 = Not Much Equity Value  

&nbsp;

Boston:  
 - Im assuming Boston does $250M of EBITDA (about half what the two LV casinos are doing - I really dont know). I googled Wynn America financing and found a Moody's piece that shows it is being financed with $375M revolver and $875M term loan. I guess the balance of the cost of the new property will be cash taken from the Las Vegas and Macau boxes.  
 - Assume it is worth 9x EBTIDA  
 - $2250 Enterprise Value  
 - $1250 Debt  
 = $1000B Equity Value or $10/share  

&nbsp;

Sum of the Parts:
 - $90.8/sh for Macau  
 - $0.0/sh for Las Vegas  
 - $10.0/sh for Boston  
 = ~$100/sh

&nbsp;

If you believe that Macau has bottomed and will return to growth in the medium term, the stock is probably cheap. If you think Macau has farther to fall, the stock is likely not cheap. One thing I want to point out is that I am counting the roughly $2B of notes that that was used to redeem the shares of that dude Wynn booted off the board a while back as debt against the Las Vegas box. I'm not endorsing this valuation, I just wanted to put some rough numbers on it if anyone wants to use it as a springboard to do their own work.

However, these past few weeks have been nasty to solar, especially SUNE which is down 72% in the last 3 months. So, is this a bargain at these current levels, or is this company heading to 0?

FORBES: SUNE has significantly increased its pipeline and backlogs. SUNE expects to have a total of 2,100-2,300 MW for FY15 and 4,200-4,500 MW for FY16. The company expects FY15 unlevered CAFD from retained MW to be in the range of $275-$325 million. However, in recent months markets were spooked by significantly higher debt and mounting losses at SUNE. The company has been highly levered for some years now and management states that the recent increase in indebtedness will go towards funding of the company’s project pipeline. SUNE has a project pipeline of ~8 GW as of June 30, 2015. Of this, ~6 GW represents project backlog, which includes projects that are either currently under construction or for which SUNE has an executed power purchase agreement (PPA) or other energy off-take agreement such as a feed-in tariff. The company’s losses continue, with operating losses at $173 million in 2Q15 as against $110 million in 2Q14. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $263 million in 2Q15 as against $42 million in 2Q14. However, we believe this loss figure is inconsequential given the fact that SUNE doesn’t sell much and prefers to retain projects for dropping down to yieldcos. Management expects the company to continue to lose money. However, it expects the cash generated by the two yieldcos under long-term contracts will begin to flow as early as the end of this year or beginning next year.

Interesting points: 

-Board members have been BUYING as this has been falling, over $1,000,000 dollars worth of shares in the past weeks

-Steve Cohen bought 15.95 million shares AFTER the huge decline at around $10 per share

-Analyst price targets say this should be around $25

2012: 10 years

2013: 9 years

2014: 7 years


Keep in mind that this is not a part of their ""business model"" of being acquisitive and cutting out fat.  Amortization of intangibles is purely tapping into reserves on acquisitions they've already paid for.  The intangible gets booked on to their balance sheet via the acquisitions line on Financing Cash Flows in a prior period.  All they're doing is recognizing acquisition expenses from prior years as cash flow in subsequent years.  The progression through time is Cash Flows From Investing (CF statement) --> Intangible Assets (Balance Sheet) --> Amortization (Income Statement) --> Cash Flows From Operations (CF statement).  The analogue to this is capital expenditures --> PP&E --> depreciation --> CFFO.  You use the former for intangibles and the latter for tangibles.



I take serious issue with the way they account for ""cash flow EPS"" as their metric for performance.  It's based off of elements that are only contained within CFFO but do not consider acquisition costs.  Conglomerates in the past have done this and it's deceptive because it dupes cash-focused investors.  Anyone who seriously wanted to gauge management's performance for a conglomerate would subtract acquisition costs from CFFO (as well as the usual capex), reason being that if acquisitions are within the normal business model of the company then acquisition costs should be treated as an expense.  In companies that grow organically, CFFO captures both revenues and expenses, which is a decent metric once you adjust for capital expenditures.  But for companies that are acquisitive, part of the expenses get shifted down the cash flow statement under Investing activities and get missed by traditional FCF measures.  So any metric for valuation that doesn't account for acquisition costs misses this major expense -- whether it's in the form of a multiple that includes amortization, such as EBITA/EBITDA, or discounted cash flows using FCF (CFFO-CapEx).

Disclosure: I am a long-only investor and hold no position in VRX.

Edited for clarity: accelerating amortization does nothing in and of itself to boost CFFO, but is a curious finding.  My best guess is that accelerating amortization is another way of writing off poor acquisitions from the past.  If investors use FCF or EBITA/EBITDA for valuation then the ""write-off"" gets baked into the ultimate valuation of the company.  In contrast, immediately expensing the write-off would not have this effect.

The next obvious question is: if management is admitting their intangibles are duds, then shouldn't they impair goodwill as well? Under GAAP you can't use the accelerated amortization trick to mask write-offs on goodwill since the rules have changed. Instead, you're required to periodically test it for impairment and write it down if book value exceeds fair value.

I have less evidence for this but what I will point out is that goodwill is impaired on a reporting unit level. This means all of the goodwill gets pooled into one account and considered as a whole. If one acquisition is a dud, you don't need to write it down if the rest of it is intact. So one thing you can do to get around writing off goodwill is to consolidate your reporting units. This is exactly what Valeant has been doing. From 2012-2013 they combined reporting segments (from 4 to 2). I don't know how much more consolidated you can get. The interesting thing is that when you do something like that, you're required to retrospectively make similar changes to prior periods for comparability. This gives you some limited insight into what those changes were. I'll spare you the gruesome details unless you want it, but the entire composition of ""Emerging Markets"" went from one of profitability to much less profitable/negative profits in some years. Yet in their disclosures they still state that Poland, Russia, Asia, Latin America, and Africa are within the category -- from both before and after reorganization. How can you retain the geographic composition of the ""Emerging Markets"" category yet have such dramatic changes in profits? My best guess is that they're burying losses by remixing the reporting units, and that way they're avoiding goodwill write-offs.",11,0.87,1444572617.0
t3_3oeaxq,Should Berkshire spin-off or sell GEICO?,"The imminence of autonomous vehicles poses a massive shock to the auto insurance industry. Liability will move to OEMs (car manufacturers and their suppliers) as human error is taken out of the equation. GEICO insures (human) drivers and will need to shift to offering insurance to autonomous automobile hardware/software manufacturers. So long as there are not major defects/hacks with autonomous vehicles and their underlying networks, there will be fewer traffic fatalities and fewer collisions. Therefore, the cost of automobile insurance will face considerable downward pressure. 

While we're still a handful of years from a complete shift to autonomous vehicles, I believe the gradual roll-out of underlying features (lane departure warnings, automatic breaking, etc) will reduce the rates of collisions and fatalities. 

While I believe Berkshire is undervalued regardless of GEICO's prospects, I do think GEICO should be sold or spun-off while investors are willing to pay a premium for the business unit/brand.

t3_3p7qqe,My Value + growth selection,"GILD and MU.

Gilead Sciences is currently trading 10.8 times TTM earnings. Generally, biotech stocks trade for far more, as they are perceived to have significant growth potential. With the chance of a revolutionary discovery, superb margins, and extremely good recent performance, it might even make sense. Gilead Sciences Inc is very cheap relative to the category. And that's not because they're a poor company. They have a rich pipeline, excellent margins and a very large competitive competitive advantage in the Hep C market, through Harvoni. The patent expires in 2018, meaning that they have 3 years before they'll need to find a new source of revenue. Currently, they have 3 HIV drugs pending regulatory approval. They're relatively weak outside of their niche (Hep C), perhaps making an acquisition a possibility.

The company faces many unique  challenges, although I still think the upside is greater than the downside. These risks include:

-Competition
-Legislative risks (notably, Hillary Clinton has expressed interest in regulating the price of drugs)
-Dependence on Harvoni

Competitors to Harvoni are still in early development, there is a strong lobby that would oppose an increase in prices, and they currently have many drugs in the pipeline, 3 years before the Harvoni patent expires, as well as the chance for an acquisition. I don't believe the aforementioned risks make a significant position in GILD excessively risky. I rate GILD a strong buy, on the basis of low valuation and significant potential. 

Micron Technology is currently trading 6.2x TTM earnings, after a small rally from 15 to 18.5 dollars. Following the latest earnings report, MU was beaten down 20%, falling further the following months. At one point, the stock was trading under stock+cash per share, and currently, it's trading 1.6x book value. If you asked me, this is extremely low valuation for a high-tech semiconductor company. MU produces NAND and DRAM, critical parts of high-tech computer products. Think of them as making chips that all smartphones, data centres and computers need. If you think people will buy a lot of those in the future, a stock like MU lets you profit without buying the companies directly. With all this talk of the next billion, the post-PC era and the power of the cloud, it seems like the future of computing can go many ways. And with overvalued, ovethyped companies like Salesforce, a cheaply valued company that profits no matter who else does seems like a dream come true. However, you still need to know about the bear in the room: MU's bad quarter. Reading the 10-Q shows that margin reductions appear again and again. Quite simply, they sold more, but sold it for less. The reductions in DRAM prices were too fast, and they couldn't reduce the production costs quuckly enough to keep up. They'll need new technology to maintain healthy margins. They happen to have a partnership with Intel, working on creating a new form of memory that seems nearly revolutionary. 3dXpoint memory is poised to be 1000x times faster than NAND, meaning that large data centres have access to a new product that vastly outperforms their old one, letting them work with extremely large amounts of data. However, Micron is not without unique risks:

-Margins worsening further
-3dXpoint not delivering what was promised
-Weakening PC/mobile/datacenter markets

These risks are significant, no doubt. I advise caution when considering stock allocation, as it depends on how bullish you are on the future of the PC markets. I consider MU  a buy; or a strong buy if you're bullish on computing.

On October 13th's earnings call, Daniel Florness, CFO of FAST, said the following: 
>Daniel Florness - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
The industrial environment is in a recession - I don’t care what anybody says, because nobody knows that market better than we do. You know, we touch 250,000 active customers a month.

>Willard Oberton - President, Chief Executive Officer
CAT, Deere, Emerson, Terex - name the list, they’re all down 8 to 10.

>Ryan Merkel - William Blair
Right.

>Daniel Florness - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
If I look at our top--you know, last quarter I cited some stats of our top 25 customers. I’ll take a broader brush and I’ll look at our top 100. Right now in the third quarter, 44 of our top 100 customers are negative. We have not lost any business with that group. They are negative in their spend. In some cases, they are negative because their business is very negative and they are somewhat negative with us. In some case, their business is treading water and they decided to tighten their belt. I mean, look at our capex next year - there is going to be suppliers to our capital spend that will have a tighter year in 2016 than they have in 2015, because we’re not automating two, three, four distribution centers in the next 12 months.

>Of that 44 that were negative, 32 of them were negative more than 10%. Of that 44 that’s negative, 17 of them were negative more than 25%. That’s a sign of a recessionary environment, because despite all that, we continue to add customers at a faster pace than we’ve done in recent years, which is about momentum into the future. We continue to grow our national account business, which is about momentum, but we have existing customers that are struggling through a pretty weak environment in their own business.

Not sure how many of you guys are gaming nerds, I for one am not any more at least for over a decade.

This is very interesting news IMO, it is essentially the same concept as Disney with Marvel. The extent of consumer penetration might not be the same, but I know Blizzard has a bunch of sci-fi themed games that have a cult following and the movies might be more in line with the lord of the rings series to give you an idea of fan fervor. 

Activision Blizzard was one of my earliest investments in 2008, but I sold early for a small profit after 4-5 years of near 0 price movement. It looks like the stock has finally moved in recent years.

Just want to get others thoughts on this for now, I haven't really followed the stock for years so I would like to get a good idea about consumer's perception about the movies. The stock tanked after the news broke out so that's a hint I guess from investors?

t3_3tbp3y,How would you value Old Trafford? That's Manchester United's fully owned stadium,"A little bit of points from my research on a pretty interesting project I am working on...

**Asset Info**

* ~75,000 capacity makes it the 8th largest stadium in Europe, 3rd largest in the England (largest is Camp Nou with 99,000 and plans to expand to 105,000)

* Has had 99.5% capacity utilization rate during MANU games for the past 15 years, meaning regardless of the team's performance (this is greater than the 80% average at Camp Nou)

* CapEx for the company ranges from 5 to 15mn GBP ($7.5mn-$22.5mn USD), averages out to 10mn GBP over the past 5 years with no notable expansions over that time period, so a reliable estimate of maintenance capex

* Held on book at 220mn GBP/$335mn along with a training facility dedicated to MANU's team which was built before 2000

* Is defined as an ""Asset of Communal Value"" to Manchester, where the team can't sell it until the local Manchester United Support Trusts make a bid for it - obviously would look bad to not sell there, so actual cash generation could be limited (this includes if the company wants to perform a sale lease-back, though there is collateralized debt on the balance sheet that is secured by the stadium)

* Analysts estimate naming rights could go for $1bn gross in 20-year contract due to MANU fan-base size, but management has said they are against selling the naming rights due to the facility's historical value

* Can invest 100mn GBP/$152mn to expand capacity by 25% to 95,000, which could increase revenue by 25% that should mostly fall through to the bottom line - and MANU has this cash on hand if it wants to do it - IRR after ~40% tax = ~15%, or CF of $20-25mn.  This would make it the largest stadium in England and the 2nd largest in Europe

**Asset's Revenue Info** (I want to exclude this from the analysis and include it as a cash flow value, but if you have some input please advise)

* Last year it generated 90mn GBP/~$140mn in revenue for Manchester United, down from 110mn GBP/~$165mn year over year due to Manchester United's failure to qualify for the Champion's league (MANU is in *this* year's champions league, so revenue should go back up)

* Costs to service the facility are included on MANU's income statement, and EBITDA margin is ~20% while EBIT margin is ~10%

* Hard to find, but saw that the Dallas Cowboys spent $1.2bn building the new AT&T stadium, which has a capacity of ~80,000. Maybe you could argue similar value to MANU.  They sold their naming rights for an estimated $17-19mn in a long-term contract that is 1/3rd the estimated cash flow MANU could generate

I'm finding it difficult to ascribe a value to something that is a historical landmark, but cannot be easily liquidated.  MANU trades at a premium to the typical company at 16x TEV/TTM EBITDA (according to CIQ screen) but how much the intrinsic company's value is is what I'm trying to derive.",8,0.75,1447871175.0
t3_3tgv5u,Are negative foreign currency impacts the biggest cop-out ever?,"This post will make it it glaringly obvious how little I know about currencies and FX, but I'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction. 

With the strong dollar we've had a lot of businesses with international exposure are having their bottom line hurt as a result of negative foreign currency impacts. I can only think of few companies where this hasn't been a problem when reporting earnings over the past year or so. 

My question is, is writing off a hurt bottom line because of the impact of FX really a legitimate reason to be concerned about a companies health? To me, its not. Using the example of PG, they had problems with this over the past year but if you dig deeper YoY unit sales increased in the areas affected, so the hurt bottom line is not the result of deteriorating fundamentals but rather a broader macro effect. I also know that regarding PG they're undergoing restructuring and what not, but I think it was a good example to use. 

Other times I feel that management talks about FX impact as a way to cover up lower demand for their products/services, and its an easy way to write off poor earnings. Can't think of an example of this one off the top of my head.

t3_3tzlxl,Old Buffett vs. New Buffett,"Buffett, along his carreer, ""evolved"" from buying Graham's cigar-butts (or net-nets) stocks to quality business at fair prices (Fisher, Munger, etc).

He also said that he had his best returns during his cigar-butt stocks era (50's), added to the fact that he managed smaller sums of money, allowing him to invest in small-caps, unlike now where his universe has shrunk.

As individual investors, and because it gave Buffett's the best returns in that era, shouldn't we stick to buying Graham's net nets or other quant strategies?, that is, fair business at cheap prices? It seems a lot of websites and books promote his style of investing (wide moats, strong brands, durable competitive advantage, etc), and it confuses me as to what approach to take.

 I like his current approach, but is it logical to apply it when our universe has no limits, unlike his, where it is mainly large caps? Maybe his investment style is specifically tailored for large caps, and people following his mantra are just blindly following an inadequate strategy for a small investor.

t3_3u3bx3,Analysis of KBIO situation. (x-post with investing),"So, many of you probably remember the stock that Skreli bought 51% of a few days ago. The same one where the naked short seller now owed Etrade $104,000. I've been watching it over the past few days and it closed the day yesterday around 40. So I'm curious about what you folks think is going on with it, and armchair predictions about what will happen.

Here's my assessment.

The stock was at 0.90 before all of these shenanigans. 

The penny stock valuation isn't terribly uncommon for a small biotech. They often develop several lead drug candidates get them up to or through initial clinical trials. And since clinical trials cost in the hundreds of million dollars they hope to sell the company or drugs to larger pharma companies. 

But since the price of KBIO has been dropping steadily since their IPO it seems that the market assessed that they didn't have much of a chance of getting their products to market.

The way I figure it, either they have unpromissing products or impressively shitty management that simply wastes their moeny. And if they have reasonable products and shitty management there would be plenty of pharma companies willing to pick up the promising candidates. My guess is their products simply suck. Possibly because they don't work, or alternately since they're monoclonal antibodies that generally run upwards of $1000/treatment there simply isn't a large enough market to justify the development costs.

So, either Skreli made a very dumb move and bought a failing drug company, maybe because he's been so impressively vilified for preying on sick people, or he knows something that everyone else doesn't, likely due to some sort of insider information.

TL:DR I think the company is vastly overvalued right now and will probably still go out of business.

Let me know what you think. (I have no stake in this, the stock is way too volatile for me to think about)",13,0.93,1448381640.0

t3_3unxbv,Morgans Hotel Group (MHGC): >100% upside from current prices,"Morgans owns two related but distinct businesses. Firstly, they own, operate and manage three hotels in Manhattan, Miami and San Francisco. Secondly they run an asset-light hotel management business, which also acts as a licensor of its Morgans, Delano, Mondrian and Hudson boutique brands.  

MHGC is currently trading at around $3.20/share. I believe MHGC will be worth $7.73 within the next year, which represents a 134% return from current prices and as such offers a very compelling risk/reward opportunity. 
 
The Morgans board has been trying to effect a transaction for nearly 3 years but has failed for 2 reasons. Firstly, the slightly awkward makeup of the company means that there are few single buyers who will be interested in both parts of the company, making a sale of the company relatively more difficult to negotiate. However, more important is the fact that the board has been divided over what the best course of action should be. There is also the overhang of the preferred shares owned by Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa, which I will elaborate on later. As a result, both management and the board have lost credibility with the market, and the stock price has plummeted by over 50% ytd.  
  
I value the Hudson in Manhattan and Delano South Beach properties at around $600m together. The Hudson is located near Columbus Circle in a very valuable location. NOI for the Hudson was around $16m for 2014 and NOI for The Delano was around $15m. I used a cap rate of ~5% and $/key of around $400,000 to value the Hudson and a cap rate of ~6.25% and $/key of 1m for the Delano. Comps I used for the Hudson include the acquisition of the Sofitel NYC by Keck Seng Investments, the acquisition of the Times Square Hotel by the Qatar Group and the acquisition of the Palce Hotel by the Lotte Group. Comps for the Delano included the sales of the SLS South Beach and the James Royal Palm hotel.
 
Currently the hotel management segment of the company is earning around $15m-16m run-rate 2015. Including fees from owned hotels, sales would come to around $23m-25m. If we assume a 37% SGA haircut on sales (consistent with comps: Marriott, Choice Hotels and Starwood), EBITDA should be around $15m. The driver of value for this business is the strength of its brands; MHGC has a great track record of managing hotels: every single hotel managed by MHGC is rated 4 stars or higher on Tripadvisor and sales at thehotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas increased by 30% and jumped by over 100 spots on Tripadvisor after rebranding to Delano Mandalay Bay last year. MHGC’s brand equity and character provides clear differentiation from competitors. There is also a lot of potential for growth (6 signed contracts in the pipeline and each contract is material to MHGC given that EBITDA is only currently around $15m). 

The main weakness of the business is that it lacks the scale of chain like Kimpton (which had 70 hotels in its network when it was sold to Intercontinental Hotels), and thus has a loyalty scheme that isn’t as extensive as its rivals. Asset light hotel management businesses generally trade at between 12x and 17x EV/EBITDA multiples. As such I think a 15x EBITDA multiple is conservative here, giving us a value of around $225m for the business.
 
Currently, total liabilities are comprised of $600m worth of debt, which includes a $400m non-recourse Hudson/Delano mortgage loan as well as the $94m lease for the Clift hotel in San Francisco. In addition, Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa owns $75m worth of preferred shares, and the company owes Yucaipa $50m of accrued preferred dividends. Yucaipa also owns warrants to purchase 12,500,000 shares of Morgans at $6.00, which is expiring in a year. Assuming a target price of $7.60, the warrants will be worth $19.2m.
 
Taking into account the property assets worth $600m, the hotel management company valued at $225m, and assuming a haircut of 90% on the NOLs worth $380m which is $38m (back of the envelope I admit, but I think it is conservative) and subtracting the net debt of $550m minus the lease of around $94m, preferred shares of $75m, accrued dividends of $50m and warrants worth $13m, the equity is worth $239m, which is around $7.73/share. 
 
On September of 2015, a few weeks ago, Rambleside Holdings, an investment firm specializing in real estate assets and securities and one of the largest shareholders of the company offered to buy the Hudson and Delano for $507m, which is lower than our valuation for the 2 hotels but still higher than the value implied by current market prices. I believe this puts a floor on the value of the hotel properties at $507m.
 
The dividend yield on Burkle’s preferred dividends will increase to 20% from 10%, thus there is an incentive for the company to redeem the shares before this happens. Currently the firm has around $50m in cash. To redeem the shares, the company will need to raise capital, most likely by selling its two hotel properties.
 
The key risk to the thesis is the role of Ron Burkle in this whole process. As the owner of the firm’s preferred shares, his interests may not be aligned with the common shareholders. Moreover, his ownership of the preferred shares gives him certain consent rights over asset sales as well as potential acquisition of MHGC by a third party, and so he has significant influence over the value of the company. It is possible for him acquire the firm's hotel assets at an artificially low price. Theoretically he can refuse consent to the sale of the properties to a third party, essentially becoming the only viable buyer. In this worst case scenario, the firm will be a price taker, since they will be forced to sell the assets at Burkle's price.

Catalysts:

* Announcement of new CEO
* Sale of hotel properties (1 year time frame)
* Redemption of preferred shares
* Continued growth of hotel management segment

t3_3vq9gj,Why are restaurant valuations where they are?,"Looking into restaurants because a fund I know of is looking to hire a restaurant analyst - they are value based. Of the ones I follow the valuations are a little egregious on both TEV/EBITDA and P/E ratios. For Example:

* CMG at 17x TEV/EBITDA and 33x P/E
* MCD at 14x TEV/EBITDA and 24x P/E
* BWLD at 12.5x TEV/EBITDA and 34x P/E

The more reasonable I see right now is CAKE at 9x TEV/EBITDA and 20x P/E., a little more acceptable but still pretty aggressive.

I can understand something being at a higher TEV/EBITDA with higher growth expected but when I look at something at 15x TEV/EBITDA and 25x earnings I can't help but be skeptical. I was looking at DRI which is at a 10x TEV/EBITDA and 25x earnings and just spun off their real-estate (implying a higher forward TEV/EBITDA for the current valuation, as they will need to start paying higher rental expenses). With the spin it's hard to recomend there is underlying value in the assets since they were literally just sold, and instead we'd need to look at a restructuring and cost cutting to promote above-market growth rates in the restaurant space if the asset ownership is minimal.

What's the deal? Is this all looking at underlying real estate, or is the market being overly enthusiastic as it looks for growth? My immediate thought is that this is a sector to avoid, but I'm looking for dissenting thoughts.",3,0.62,1449449819.0

t3_3yvxxc,Basic question here: price earnings,"First time caller, long time listener... I would really appreciate help on the following question on what seems to be a widely used ratio when looking at stocks. I'm still at high school, don't invest but am very interested in how stock analysis works. But baby steps first...

So: with price earnings if a stock is currently trading on say 15x and 10x next year, what do I take from that? 

1) Does it mean that investors should wait until next year to invest ie when it is cheaper? 
2) Are current and forward PE calculated using the current share price then dividing by this year's EPS and then NEXT year's EPS for the forward PE? 
3) This is the one I have trouble with... A high PE would imply the company is growing in terms of earnings, BUT surely if the EPS is high/growing then the PE should be lower as that number can be divided into the current share price fewer times? 

I hope these questions make sense - as said, any guidance or links to useful explanations would be great.

Happy new year!

Path 1 , certainly a proven path, go back to B-school on a part-time basis while continuing to work on generate and sharing investment ideas on VIC, SA. However, I can't start B-School until Fall 2017 given the work required related to admissions and session schedule. Assuming one gets through, sometime during 2019 seems likely when I am able to switch. Costs nearly $120-$130K

Path 2 - Enroll for CFA , Finish Level I by Dec this year , and work progressively on remaining two levels. A big undertaking - no doubt,  but costs too little when compared to a B-School. 
But the dilemma emanates when one assesses the opportunities available  subsequently. A MBA certainly provides a nice platform , leverages b-school brand name to re-launch your career , whereas CFA is more of self-driven endeavor and landing into a job as such is completely dependent on your efforts to network as such. 

On surface, risk appears to be low with CFA but returns could be erratic as well , and on other hand, MBA is a bigger financial commitment but rewards seem more probable.

I was inspired by the [New security analysis post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3zaabn/how_to_get_the_most_out_of_rsecurityanalysis/) So I wanted to give it a try by asking a few questions.

I've read a few of the prescribed valuation books that everyone is told to read and have ordered some that Michael Burry once recommended in an interview (Intelligent Investor, Stocks and uncommon profits, why stocks go up and down and buffettology)

I have also watched countless value investing interviews like aswath and read www.cornerofberkshireandfairfax.ca often. Taken a few online accounting courses. I still feel like it is hard to dig into an annual report/10k. I'm wondering how you guys first learned to valuate a company. Did you just jump right into a DCF?

A few other questions:

Do you invest in emerging markets?

Do you have a checklist that you follow (eg. Guy Spier)?

How do you screen for companies?

What industries do you leave out?

t3_3zaabn,How to get the Most out of /r/SecurityAnalysis,"Hi Guys,

This sub has grown considerably over the past year and I’ve been encouraged by the increased number of people posting quality content and leaving substantive comments. Posts like [this]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2r77lk/financial_analysis_of_real_property_investments/), [this]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3p07sd/how_bad_will_it_get_for_american_express/), and [this]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3unxbv/morgans_hotel_group_mhgc_100_upside_from_current/) fostered discussion that did not happen in previous years. While we hope this trend continues, we’ll need help to ensure content and comment quality in this sub remains high. Here are some helpful hints on how to help us make that happen and how to get the most out of /r/SecurityAnalysis.

* **1.	Read the Sidebar and Use the Resources there**

Many subreddits don’t put much effort into their Sidebar, but /u/Beren- has aggregated valuable resources that I have come to use regularly. Here are some resources that have been helpful for me:

**[Reading List](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/239qj8/updated_reading_list/)** – There are great books for learning about all aspects of Value Investing. The Reading List is separated by topic for ease of use and was updated in early 2014.

**[MBA Valuation Classes](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqfall15.htm)** – Damodaran’s classes are a great way to improve your Valuation skills. Lessons learned here become very powerful when combined with the unit economics of the businesses you examine. The Sidebar Links will remain updated when the new classes are posted.

**Financial Information** – [EDGAR](http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) and [SEDAR](http://www.sedar.com/search/search_en.htm). I read a lot of financial statements and I prefer to get them directly from the source. [SEC Live](http://www.seclive.com/) may be useful for those that find wading through EDGAR difficult. You miss out on information that companies are providing to the financial regulatory authorities if you only read 10-Ks and 10-Qs. In addition to other financial filings, also examine at press releases, earning call replays/transcripts, executive interviews, business articles, and books about companies/industries. 

**Stock Exchanges** – Many countries don’t have an entity like EDGAR or SEDAR, but company financial information can be obtained directly from their resident stock exchanges. 

**[Ben Graham Centre](http://www.bengrahaminvesting.ca/)** – This is the website for the Ivey Business School in Canada. They have a great value investing tradition and their website has links to Value Investing academic research, Videos of Guest Lecturers, and a host of other resources.

**[Value Investor’s Club](http://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/value2/)** – Contains stock pitches from value investors that tend to have a special situations angle. If you want to see what a good analysis of a stock looks like, sign up for a guest account here and read the highest rated ideas. Additionally, you can steal ideas from where Whitney Tilson and Joel Greenblatt steal ideas from. 

**[Macabacus](http://macabacus.com/)** – Has many great financial models available to download for free. Examining the structure and formatting of these models will help you improve your financial modelling skills. I recommend that you combine these models with Damodaran's Corporate Finance &amp; Valuation Classes.

**[Whale Wisdom](http://whalewisdom.com/)** – Cloning is one of the sources for my ideas and every once in awhile I find a new fund that is worth tracking by browsing the posts there.

* **2.	If you’d like to have an open ended discussion of individual securities, your post must contain analysis**

Analysis is not a recitation of P/E ratios or growth rates. Analysis should mention how a company’s business, assets, earnings, industry, or other factors makes the security you’re discussing undervalued or overvalued. You can find examples of what NOT to post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3wxt72/thoughts_on_qualcomm_qcom/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3wybhr/thoughts_on_investing_in_brewdog/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3wydk3/anyone_a_little_nervous_about_under_armour_ua/), or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3wsz1z/starbucks_sbux/). If those examples don’t make it clear, posts probing for “Thoughts” while producing no analysis are actively discouraged.

For excellent examples of what to post, look at what [pershingcubed did here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3unxbv/morgans_hotel_group_mhgc_100_upside_from_current/), what [redcards did here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3s64tg/my_analysis_of_manning_napier_mn/), what [spyflo &amp; team did here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3j2bc1/summer_equity_project/), or what [hedgefundaspirations did here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/30ef7s/heres_a_condensed_summary_of_my_research_on_arlp/). While these posts provide more extensive examples of analysis, posts looking to discuss individual securities need not be this thorough.
We desire to keep the discussion in this sub high level and want to prevent it from devolving into mindless chatter. 

**Your post will be deleted if it does not contain any analysis as baseless speculation helps no one.** It is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation. Please downvote posts that attempt to discuss individual securities with no analysis and we will remove them as soon as we can.

* **3.	Ask Specific Questions**

Asking specific questions fosters worthwhile discussion and thoughtful answers help people improve their investing skills. There are many knowledgeable people here that can answer questions. However, vague, unbounded questions require a lot of time to answer thoroughly and answers may completely miss the poster’s underlying intent. The “Thoughts” posts actively discouraged in point #2 exemplify this class of vague question.

/u/time2roll has done a pretty good job of [asking specific questions over the past couple years](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=author%3Atime2roll+flair%3Aquestion&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and these specific questions tend to elicit great responses and discussion. I would encourage people to follow this model when posing questions to this sub.

**Please don’t attempt to answer questions if you don’t know the answer**. Once again, it is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation. Additionally, please don’t say anything if you don’t have anything helpful to say. There are some very knowledgeable people in this subreddit and I would love for their insights to be on display.

* **4.	Search /r/SecurityAnalysis**

Reddit’s search used to be horrible, but now it’s a lot better. Search is even more powerful when you specify link flair in your query as well. 
For example, if you were looking for all the [David Einhorn theses that were posted in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=einhorn+flair%3Athesis&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) or [all Warren Buffett Interviews posted in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=Buffett+flair%3Ainterview&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) you can find them by searching with link flair using the specified queries. Sometimes I follow situations that take a long time to resolve and I’ll post links here because they are interesting. For instance, I’ve followed Caesars’ recapitalization/spinoffs/bankruptcy for almost 3 years. Because I put the name of the company in every submission title, I can review all of those posts by just searching for [Caesars](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=caesars&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).
People have been posting in /r/SecurityAnalysis for over 5 years and a lot of valuable posts can be uncovered this way.


* **5.	Post interesting articles about Investment Search Strategy, Investment Analysis, Value Investing Philosophy, and Risk Management Techniques**

You'll find plenty of things to post if you read with an active mind. News, especially business news, should be read as events that people make happen rather than things happening randomly. Once you start asking why people are making these things happen, the news will become an examination of how companies respond to their competitors, how products evolve to meet the needs of customers, and how management creates or destroys value for shareholders. Each bit of news about a company or industry can be used as a building block to a case study in valuing companies. You can really see this when you look at [the Caesars situation referenced in point #3 and how it evolved over time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=caesars&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all). 

* **6.	If you don’t know how to analyze securities, read books in the Reading List, use the resource links in the Sidebar, and ask specific questions**

I’m aware this is essentially the same point #1 and point #3, but I want to reiterate how great the Sidebar is and how helpful people here can be.

Everyone starts their journey into Value Investing somewhere. Regardless of where you are on that path, /r/SecurityAnalysis is a great place to be.

t3_3zw0dk,CLD Investment Brief,"Note: This is not professional investment advice. The following is a brief I wrote for myself and update periodically. I chose to publish it up for critique. 
---

Buy CLD common stock in the $2 area and hold to sell at $16 or higher. The buy-in target reflects an 85% discount to tangible book value. With the stock currently selling at less than two times free cash flow, CLD possesses a huge margin of safety. 

Cloud Peak Energy is a holding company that manages its 100% owned subsidiary, Cloud Peak Energy Resources. The Company is a producer of coal in the USA and the Powder River basin (PRB). The Company operates in three segments: Owned and Operated Mines, Logistics and Related Activities, and Corporate and Other. The Owned and Operated Mines segment focuses on thermal coal production. The Logistics and Related Activities segment delivers coal to the customer at a terminal or the customer’s plant or other delivery point, remote from its mine site. The Corporate and Other segment include results relating to broker activity, its share of the Decker mine operations. 

The current price of CLD common stock has been pounded by rapidly falling coal prices. This negative pressure is due to: (a) the vast quantities of natural gas available; (b) weak demand and significant oversupply for both thermal and metallurgical coal due to slower than expected economic growth in both the United States and overseas markets (such as China, the largest user of met and thermal coal in the world); (c) the imposition of restrictive regulations around coal; and (d) amendments to transportation and throughput agreements. 

CLD is one of the lowest cost producers in the industry and is currently one of the few coal companies with both positive EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Current free cash flow per share is $1.39, and this is under terrible industry conditions. This means that the common stock currently sells at less than two times free cash flow. 

The only risk CLD has is industry risk. It poses no significant credit risk.  
It has two fixed rate senior note issues outstanding (8.50% 2019 $300M / 6.375% 2024 $200M) and a capital leasing program. 
CLD possesses sufficient liquidity - through cash ($123.5M), FCF ($34M), as well as an undrawn revolver ($500M) and an undrawn A/R Securitization facility ($45.2M).  
Both the revolver and the A/R securitization facility carry variable rates, which may pose a risk if drawn. The capital leasing program ($7.8M of borrowings) also carries variable rates, however the impact on cash flow from a rise in rates would not be significant. 
The covenants on the credit agreement include the following: 
EBITDA/Cash Interest Expense ≥ 1.50 
Net Secured Debt/EBITDA ≤4 
TTM EBITDA > $125M 
CLD is in full compliance of all the covenants, with 2.12 EBITDA/Cash Interest Expense and $167.4M TTM adjusted EBITDA.
* Note that the EBITDA calculation in the Credit Agreement differs from the standard calculation. Under the notes’ covenants dividends and repurchases are also limited. 

The equity unquestionably has incredible upside potential. You can buy CLD common stock for less than two times free cash flow and at a discount of 85% to tangible book value. This is for a company with 14.37% average five-year return on equity and 8.69% average five-year return on invested capital.

For those even more cautious, the notes are guaranteed by subsidiaries with more than enough asset coverage. The 2019 notes are currently selling in the low 50s territory - most likely due to being subordinated to the revolver, which has a first priority lien on all assets except the LBA leases. Note that at the moment the revolver stands undrawn. 

This is considered a “good” cigar butt. Good because of the financial position of the company, cigar butt because of price and lack of short-term catalysts other than industry sentiment improvement and a credit upgrade.",3,0.67,1452181695.0

t3_40dbad,Too Cheap to Ignore – Buying 100 Shares of KORS at $39.,"Kors trades at a steep discount to its peers after a few quarters of weaker than expected growth. 2016 holds upside for the company has fundamental drivers for growth and margins remain intact. As investors see the intrinsic value in Kors with higher margins and stronger growth than peers, the stock will likely revert towards $60 providing a 50% upside to investors at current prices. 
With the stock down 45% in the past year, Kors has suffered from consensus selling of the consumer apparel space as peers such as RL (-41%), FOSL (-71%), KATE (-41%), M (-41%) as well as some idiosyncratic issues since the company has failed to grow overall same store sales in the past three Qs. Management has cited the reason for weaker same store growth comes from a shift into smaller handbags for women, thereby reducing KORS sales of its higher margin products. 

However, longer term I think the core drivers for the business are intact 1) international growth remains an area of opportunity as European revenues have grown at a 100% CAGR from FY12-FY15 and even if projected to grow at a slowing rate, can be expected to drive incremental growth in CY17. 2) Wholesale distribution strategy remains intact with a 16% CAGR in CY13-15 in wholesale revenue. Kors holds key relationships with its distributors, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Neiman Marcus to name a few. 3) As marketing increasingly shifts to digital through social media and mobile, Kors holds a competitive advantage to peers. For a basic check - Kors with 17M Facebook likes outstrips peers with higher revenue bases such as Ralph Lauren with 8.4M likes, Coach with 6M likes. With improvements to its online sales and distribution channel, Kors holds an opportunity to capture share moving forward as global consumers spend online. 

When comparing the valuation vs. comparables, the difference is substantial. Kors trades at only 5X 2016 EBITDA, 12.5X FCF, 9x EPS in spite of 11% revenue growth in 2015 and 5% in 2016. This compares its peers such as RL at 8.5X EBITDA and 20X FCF with 3% growth in 2015, KATE at 9X EBITDA and 21X FCF 8% growth in CY15. The company has no substantial debt vs $430M in cash and inventory levels, receivables, and payables remain at historical levels as a % of revenues. Despite being one of the highest margin businesses in consumer retail at 25% operating margins, the stock trades at one of the lowest valuations, signaling that investors have priced in Kors products are oversaturated and expect FCF / EBIT to decline significantly in to 2016. For the company’s valuation to be in line to peers at ~20x FCF, 2016 FCF would need to decrease by 35%. Any strength in either growth or margins outside of the 35% decline may presents upside to the stock which seems like a favorable set up. 

In the past two quarters, Greenlight capital has also been accumulating 7M shares, its third largest position, and 5% of its fund. Looking through their shareholder letter, Greenlight also cites valuation and lack of distribution disruptions as areas of upside for the stock. 

Catalyst

Although pure discount in valuation may not be a sole catalyst for a stock, I think over time investors will recognized Kors is a severely discounted asset. Fiscal Q3 earnings may provide some of this evidence as the company posts holiday sales numbers, and FQ4 may be the next catalyst as the company posts initial FY17 guidance. For FY17, I am expecting $4,830M in revenues and $1,155M in operating income, relatively in line with sell side consensus. 

Risk

One area of concern is that a Google trend search for Kors shows a decline in YoY interest while peers such as KATE has witnessed an increase. Although some deceleration is probably baked into expectations, if the company misses guidance, valuations could further compress.",9,0.76,1452461362.0

here is the quote from the book...
""To solve this, Allied used a rule in the tax code that permitted them to defer distributing the taxable income to shareholders for a year by paying a 4 percent excise tax. Of course, this made no economic sense. Had they paid the distributions, the shareholders would pay long - term capital gains tax at a 15 percent rate on the income. Effectively, the 4 percent excise tax was a 26 percent interest rate one - year loan. (Shareholders were deferring paying a 15 percent tax for one year. The cost was 4 percent — paid by the company: 4/15 = 26.6 percent). ""

seem to me that from an investors point of view interest rate would be a 4% + expected rate of return over the one year period.

t3_41hjhe,Building more sophisticated financial models and understanding operating leverage,"Hi everyone. First time poster here. Would love to hear the community's thoughts on how they create more useful financial models. Specifically, how do you look at fixed vs variable cost breakdowns to estimate incremental margins? And how do you estimate EBITDA or EBIT break-even points? It's very nice when EBITDA break-evens and/or contribution margins are laid out in IR presentations and the like, but that's the exception and not the norm.

I'm a big fan of avoiding precision bias, so I'll usually focus on more qualitative factors than the typical trend extrapolation that dominates a lot of investment analysis. I see quite a few analysts setting SG&A to an average percentage of sales over the last 3 - 5 years and then adding small incremental improvements per year without a strong grounding in the unit economics of the business, and this seems like lunacy to me. But qualitative factors don't matter much without a quantitative framework - for example, knowing that there's a lot of excess capacity is great, but it's most helpful if I can understand it in the context of what incremental margins look like.

I sometimes try extrapolating EBIT growth divided by revenue growth to get a sense for operating leverage, but it's a very Rube Goldberg way of doing things and not necessarily indicative of what's going to happen going forward. Another way is looking at competitors with lower relative cost structures and estimating that the target improves over a number of years to hit that target, but this option isn't always useful or even available (sometimes there's no applicable competitor/peer group). I'll also compare quarter-over-quarter increases of EBIT and revenue and can get a sense for incremental EBIT margin that way. This last way seems like the best way to me, but there's usually so much noise that it's not frequently accurate.

Anyone else have a good way for quantifying this sort of marginal analysis?",9,0.86,1453095132.0

t3_41xkz1,On Shorting E&P Companies,"I had a friend recently ask me about what my thoughts were over shorting E&P stocks. I wrote back with the following. Curious to know what y'alls thoughts are. 

To me most of the shorts have played out. It's very expensive to short most of these midcap/smallcap E&P's and they're already trading at pennies; additionally, the decline in oil prices has been priced in. At this point if you want to short one of these stocks you'd need some type of catalyst beyond oil price declines. 

For me shorting most of these distressed E&P's that are trading at pennies is a strategy very similar to merger arbitrage at this point. You're betting on a bankruptcy to trigger the equity value going to zero. You can target a number of operators whose debts are trading at >$.70 on the dollar and that are most likely to violate their credit agreements in the next 3-6 months. The risk you're taking is if they get acquired or have successful asset sales to avoid triggering a bk / are able to work out an agreement w/ their creditor. 

I see more compelling longs in guys like PXD/ FANG that have recently been able to raise equity and have cash on hand to make some great acquisitions and build out their portfolio. Between assets sales from E&P's trying to stay afloat and from bankruptcy proceedings its a buyer's market and they could be well positioned for a rebound in the oil market. 

From a macro perspective it's always darkest before dawn, and looking at how last crash played out, when oil rebounded, it rebounded hard. Here are some of the things I'm thinking about:

- Announced 2016 Capex for E&P's is 30%+ down from last year, probably even more now since most guys were determining off of $40 oil

- Declines on shale wells are very steep, usually 50+% in the first year, people or underestimated how quickly production can roll off

- Looking at what caused the current crash: sluggish demand and oversupply in from NAM fracking producing light sweet crude that yields an large amount of gasoline compared to heavier crudes like Bahrain or Maya. This was the reason the fracking revolution was such a market shock, it's not just the amount of production, but the actual product. In thinking about what has traditionally driven oil prices: it's gasoline demand for US in the summer and gasoil demand for Europe in the winter. The former was impacted by domestic light sweet crude becoming abundant the latter was impacted by a mild winter. The point I'm trying to make is that the stars really aligned for this drop to happen

- On Iran/Saudi, with the current instability you'd figure it'd increase the price of oil; really though, there's a convexity in the price of oil relative to the Saudi-Iran relationship. If Saudi/Iran were to get along or at least be bearable to each other then that would allow OPEC to have more strength in establishing and enforcing quotas. Since the recent slaying of Shia muslims in Saudi Arabia the likelihood of the Saudis and Iran colluding has gone to zero, in fact the opposite is going to happen. Saudi Arabia's main goal throughout the last 6 months has been to keep Iran weak. People think the Saudis increased production to kill the US fracking industry - really they could care less - most geopolitical experts like Gen. Petraeus agree that ever since sanctions have been lifted on Iran the new Saudi goal has been to protect itself from Iran. The main strategy has been to prevent Iran's oil and gas industry from being able to get off the ground in part by tanking the price of oil, thereby starving Iran of cash, the recent execution of Shia muslims was most likely a deliberate attempt to further provoke Iran. Where the convexity kicks in is that if hostilities between the two countries were to escalate to the point of war then you'd see an increase in the price of oil - both countries reserves lie in the Persian Gulf in between each other. 

- Taking the aforementioned points in mind there's a good case to be made for potential oil recovery, any black-swan event I can think of would bias towards increasing the price of oil. My only real fear is if we enter a recession globally, and it seems like it could be a very real possibility - then all bets are off.",10,0.92,1453340275.0

t3_44c74r,Long PLOW Writeup,"**INTRODUCTION**

I believe that Mr. Market is currently offering Douglas Dynamics (PLOW) at a 30% discount to intrinsic value. 

As North America’s premier manufacturer of snow plows, de-icing equipment, and vehicle attachments, Douglas Dynamics possesses two formidable moats stemming from their ability to produce high-quality products more cheaply than their competitors, and then selling those products through an extensive network of dealers.  

Further, the company has significant advantages in the shareholder-oriented management team, a high free cash flow conversion rate, low capital spending requirements, and a largely variable cost structure. These considerations make Douglas Dynamics a company that can weather most any storm (pun intended). 

An unseasonably warm winter in Douglas Dynamics’s core markets has driven the stock down to $18.50---offering investors the opportunity to buy a great company at only 10X earnings,  a 12.5% FCF yield, and a 19% operating earnings yield! Additionally, management is dedicated to paying a significant dividend (5% current yield) under all weather conditions, without sacrificing near- or long-term liquidity. 

**WHY IS IT CHEAP?**

The primary factor weighing on Douglas Dynamics’s stock is the psychological tendency to overweight near-term salient factors (what Munger calls the “availability-misweighing tendency""), which in this case is the impact the warm winter will have on the company's core markets. With temperatures pushing 70 degrees on Christmas in much of the Northeast and little indication of snow, it is easy to discount a business whose prosperity presupposes wintry conditions. 

Looking at a small sample size, snowfall amounts indeed appear to be highly varied and unpredictable. But by widening the sample to Douglas's 66 core cities, we get a consistent rolling ten-year average annual snowfall of 3,100 inches. The market appears to be over-focusing on the short-term catalyst of heavy snow fall (or lack thereof), and overlooking longer-term factors, such as the high quality of the business and management's record of prudent capital allocation. 

With an estimated 600K units in use, and an average 7 - 8 year replacement cycle (at $5K - $9K each for light-duty mounted plow), Douglas Dynamics can count on a continual demand for products---even if that demand may be uneven. Because snow poses a grave and immediate threat to public safety and productivity, there will always exist a critical need to quickly remove it from roads. In short, it is not a matter of if customers will buy Douglas Dynamics products, but when. 

Despite the ill effects that a mild winter will no doubt have on Douglas Dynamics, the market has likely overreacted in the short term---presenting patient investors an attractive opportunity to buy a high-quality business trading at a 30% discount to intrinsic value.

t3_44bry4,Long HBP Write Up,"**Business Description**

Huttig Building Products, Inc. [NASDAQ: HBP] (“Huttig” or the “Company”) is an 81.6mn market cap U.S. housing supply company headquarted in St. Louis, Missouri. Huttig has a rich corporate history dating back to 1885, and over the years have positioned themselves as a dominant middleman between product manufactures and their customers in the local markets they service.

 Through its distribution centers, Huttig supplies millwork and building products (88% of revenue) (doors, windows, stair components, and molding) used in residential construction and remodeling and wood products (12% of revenue) (flooring systems, panels, and lumber) to an established network of specialty dealers and general retailers.

Huttig’s value add is two-fold. Their national distribution footprint provides the Company with economies of scale that offer customers access to a broader range of inventory than they normally would have access to at a more attractive price than what a manufacturer would charge, as well as next-day delivery on orders. Additionally, Huttig performs post-purchase processing on products to job-specific configurations needed by end customers, something that manufacturers with standardized SKUs are often not able to perform. 


**Investment Thesis**

* HBP will compound at a double digit rate over the next 5 years, driven by (1) bottom-line margin expansion from 0.4% to 1.3%, (2) cash margin expansion from 0.3% to 2.5%, and (3) increased analyst coverage and street visibility with upcoming management change.
* Bottom-line margin expansion will be driven by (1) 4-6% top-line growth as HBP’s serviceable market grows faster than the market is expecting, and (2) incremental cost savings as top-line growth outpaces growth in fixed variable fuel and wage expenses.

* Cash margin expansion will be driven by (1) unlocking of $107mn worth of net operating loss carry-forwards (NOLs) that the market has not recognized, (2) NOL contribution of an average $14.6mn to free cash flow over the next 5 years.

* Recruitment of a new CFO is focused on identifying candidates with extensive M&A and investor relations experience; street visibility will be considerably increased once a qualified CFO has been recruited along with a free option on any future accretive M&A. 

**Valuation**

I value HBP on 2017 FCF. HBP trades at 7.0x FCF, and I conservatively assume this multiple in my methodology to arrive at the Company’s various valuation scenarios despite the higher comps average. A DCF valuation of HBP also yields similar results to my P/FCF valuation.

My valuation yields a base price target of $5.09, 55.1% upside to current price. Bull case price target of $5.96, 81.7% upside to current price. My bear case price target of $3.01, -8.2% downside to current price. I believe my valuation scenarios result in an asymmetric risk/reward profile for the Company.

t3_44zf4q,More of a personal question than a technical one.,"Hello r/SecurityAnalysis

I have been reading this sub for a long time now and am teaching myself the principles of value investing. What I am trying to get a general sense of is how many people here invest professionally, invest personally, or just read for fun. 

Do any of you live off the returns you have generated and/or run your own fund? From what I have gathered value investing is very much focused on long time horizon with larger pools of capital. As someone coming in with a low amount of funds I do not expect to make crazy returns but I do massive appetite to learn and I firmly believe in the principles which makes the reading and learning all too engaging. 

To simplify this, how many people here do this for a living and has anyone been in my shoes who can recommend a road map or destination goal?

t3_456ivm,A napkin valuation of Amazon’s buyback,"So we know that Amazon just announced a $5 billion buyback. In what world does that sound like a good idea? 

Amazon’s P/E is currently 400, give or take a bit. To justify that valuation, either one or both of these has to be true: i) earnings are apparently but not intrinsically depressed, or ii) there is tremendous future growth. I’m thinking that both assumptions have to be in play for a P/E of 400 to exist. 

Let us assume for a second that earnings have been depressed by 4x, while the remainder “intrinsic P/E” of 100 is attributable to growth. Let’s tackle the first assumption first. Bull case says that it is cash flow that matters, not earnings. Well, we know two myths about the cash flow vs earnings argument. 

One, Amazon is investing in CAPEX for growth, hence the depressed earnings. We know this is not the case, as CAPEX would be capitalized on the balance sheet without affecting earnings. Furthermore, the bulk of expenses are categorized under the line item *Fulfillment*. This implies that most of the expenses are attributable to operating costs, not R&D. Even if we give the benefit of doubt, there is no reason why R&D should take up 40% of revenues. Even half of that would be excessive. One might make the argument that Amazon is accelerating depreciation of warehouses, by far their biggest cash flow expenditure, in favour of conservative accounting. Starbucks did this in the late 90’s, according to Penman’s book. However, we can see that is not the case, as *depreciation/amortization* is its own line item – and it is insignificant, less than 3% revenues. So we’re really left scratching our heads about where fulfilment expenses are coming from. 

Secondly, we know that Amazon is basically an online Walmart. Which means they have negative working capital. What this means is that they accept goods from suppliers, sell them first, and only then do they pay them back 30-60 days later. This is immensely advantageous, as it acts as a gigantic float. Having said that, it also obscures true free cash flow at year end. We know that Amazon’s biggest sales are during the holiday seasons of Christmas and New Year’s. Thus, they can report huge upfront operating cash flows before they’re paid to suppliers as part of FCF – which actually doesn’t belong to them. So much for the cash flow argument. 


What about growth? Well, a reverse DCF shows that a 100x P/E implies a 20 year CAGR of 25%. This is Buffett level growth, post-insurance float. Keep in mind that most analysts are only projecting about 10 years into the future, which implies a 58% CAGR. That’s approximately what Starbucks achieved - from date of inception. Not from juggernaut status. Even if it became the global status quo by overtaking Alibaba and global economic growth maintained at historical levels of 2.5%, it would not justify its P/E.

So what is Bezos doing with a $5 billion buyback? Not to be sceptical, but it seems like a confidence-maintaining move. Enron did a buyback in 2001 when shares fell from $100 to $15. There doesn’t need to be fraud for overvaluation to exist.

t3_45f99w,Interesting Stock? GWR.TO,"Occasional lurker, first time posting.

&nbsp;

I stumbled across this security last night, and I am trying to understand it, hoping for insight from others in /r/securityanalysis.

&nbsp;

GWR opened on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2010. The purpose of this corporation is to hold shares in GWRI, a corporation in Delaware, and it acquired a significant stake (48.1%). GWRI operates principally in Phoenix, and is focused on water resource management that owns and operates regulated water, wastewater and recycled water utilities in communities within Phoenix.

&nbsp;

GWR very recently filed paperwork with the SEC to be co-listed on the NASDAQ, which, to my understanding, usually leads to a large jump in liquidity and price.

&nbsp;

As to the financials, and here is the part that I'm trying to understand, they've gone from mediocre performance to pushing out a TTM FCF yield of nearly 20% (edit: much higher, as FCF is reported in USD), and prior to this initiated a very healthy dividend (not withstanding their special dividend). They don't appear to do anything other than hold their shares, so my question is: where did this jump in cashflow come from?

Despite this, demand-supply hasn't caused the price of bottled water to fall to single digit cents. The fact that soda is cheaper than bottled water rules out the idea that the container/distribution/fixed cost/marketing makes up the majority of costs and thus cannot be reduced. 

In addition, bottled water occupies a wide range of prices which stick, which makes even less sense since there is less differentiation and marketing going on compared to soda.

I am 16 years old and I am currently looking for strong long-term (10-15 years) investments. The following company is one that I'm interested in. Tell me what you think.

*Note: I do not own any shares of AmTrust. Please do the proper research before investing in any companies that I recommend.* 


**Company:** AmTrust Financial Services

Date: *2/24/2016*

**Stock Ticker**: AFSI

**Sector**: Financial

**Industry**: Property and Casualty Insurance

**Company Statistics vs Industry-Wide Stats**

AmTrust stock has a much better value than the average company stock in the property and casualty insurance industry based off of multiple factors 

First, its P/E ratio. Using data off of Yahoo Finance, AmTrust has a P/E ratio of 9.05 compared to the average P/E ratio of 19.1 for other stocks in the industry. Also attractive to the value investor is AmTrust's return on equity, which is 20.43% compared to the industry standard of 9.2%. 

AmTrust has a P/B value of 1.98, which is about par for property/casualty insurance companies which, on average, have a P/B ratio of 2. 

AmTrust also has strong profit and operating margins, 10.8% and 12.67% respectively, as well as a high quarterly year on year revenue growth of 15.40%. 

AmTrust has a dividend yield of 2.36% vs. the industry standard of 2.8%. However, I believe this small difference in price yield is more than made up for by the higher ROE and lower P/E ratio AmTrust has compared to other property/casualty insurance companies. 

**What exactly does AmTrust do?**

AmTrust underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance products such as workers' compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and extended service and warranty coverage, in the United States and internationally to niche customer groups that, generally, are underrepresented in the insurance market. 

The company strategy is to target niche, small and middle-sized customers using in the United States and Europe using a proprietary technology platform to efficiently manage the high volume of policies and claims that they receive. 

AmTrust approaches acquisitions conservatively by taking modest balance sheet risks, including acquiring companies, access to distribution networks, and hirings of established teams of insurance underwriters.

**Strengths and Future Opportunities**

A big strength of AmTrust is its key statistics compared to companies in the industry, indicating that the company stock is undervalued. 

Another big strength is the proprietary technology that AmTrust uses, which allows the company to ""appropriately price and structure policies, maintain lower levels of loss, enhance [their] ability to accurately predict losses, and maintain lower claims costs than the industry as a whole."" Wherever possible, AmTrust adjusts the terms, conditions, and exclusions of their coverage to manage their risk and increase their profitability. 

Another part of AmTrust's strength is the fact that the company targets niche customers where the market is not as competitive as the broader market and where AmTrust's level of expertise provides them with a distinct advantage over other competitors in the industry.

AmTrust and its principal insurance subsidiaries are rated ""Excellent"" by an independent organization, A.M. Best Company, an organization that analyzes insurance companies. ""Excellent"" is A.M. Best Company's third highest of 16 rating levels.

AmTrust's effective and robust policies are shown through the company's high retention rates for its insurance policies, with an average policy renewal rate of 86% for the years of 2014,2013, and 2012.

AmTrust has strong future earnings potential, with analysts predicting that over the next 5 years the company will grow earnings at an average annual rate of 11%. http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/earnings-growth



**Weaknesses and Risks**

AmTrust is currently involved in several class action lawsuits filed in February 2014 in the southern district of New York. According to their 10-K SEC filing, the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss. This lack of loss estimates suggests that perhaps there are potentially large losses at risk and that the company does not want to erode stakeholder confidence. That being said, I believe the claims made by litigators are unsubstantiated. The cases are currently in appeal, but judges have ruled in AmTrust's favor in the past. 

Volatile financial markets could adversely affect their business operations, financial positions, and liquidity. In the case of an economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could negatively impact confidence in the company.

There are no policy limits on Amtrust's liability for worker's compensation claims unlike other forms of insurance. In the event of catastrophic losses or a force majeure, AmTrust could theoretically be forced to pay out significant amounts of money to the workers they insure.

A large amount of Amtrust's money (About $4.25 billion or 77% of their investment portfolio) is concentrated into fixed income securities. In general, the market value of fixed income securities decrease as interest rates rise. Conversely, when interest rates decrease the market value of the securities increase. According to their filing, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $207.3 million decrease in Amtrust's investments. 

**Economic Moats**

What makes AmTrust much more effective at producing returns and reducing risks is through how its business is structured. AmTrust has three business segments: Small Commercial Business, Specialty and Extended Warranty Risk, and Specialty Program. AmTrust's moat comes in its small commercial business side of the company, with its small commercial business segment making up 49.3% of their gross written premium in 2014, 40.3% in 2013, and 34% in 2012. 

The small business segment for worker's comp, which continues to increasingly take up a majority of the companie's gross written premium, is less competitive for the large insurance market because of the lower average premium and smaller policy which do not fit the profitability criteria of their customers. This allows AmTrust to work in a niche market that allows them to make money consistently and obtain a portion of the market share that other insurance companies are restricted from.





**Analyst Ratings**

Although I take analyst ratings with a grain of salt, some people may find them to be insightful. To that end, all of the analyst ratings for AmTrust have been positive. According to: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/recommendations  

Out of 5 analysts, 4 gave it a strong buy and 1 gave it a buy.

**Overall**

I give AmTrust Financial Services a BUY rating based off of several factors: its favorable P/E and ROE, its strong future earnings potential, and the unique way the business is structured to target niche clients in an underrepresented market. I believe the market is currently undervaluing AmTrust because of lower consumer confidence in the financial markets, and that the recent dip in its price is not based off of fundamentals.

t3_47qjil,Help me take a look at HTS,"New to investing and doing my first read through of The Intelligent Investor. I got to HTS through graham stock screener online and decided to look into it more myself. 



HTS is an REIT that does a significant majority of its business in government agency backed mortgage backed securities. The rest of its operational business is mortgage servicing rights, non agency backed MBS, and morgage lending. 

The balance sheet shows these assets (in thousands): 

* Mortgage Backed Securities - 14,302,230
* Agency CRT Securities - 109,387
* Cash and equivalents - 816,715
* Accrued Interest Receivable - 45,008
* Principal Payments Receivable - 108,201

These assets total ~$15.38B  with total liabilities of ~$14B. I get a net value of these specific assets at $14.37 per outstanding share. The stock is currently selling at $13.93. Looking at total assets instead of just the selected ones above values the stock at ~$22.00


**Dividends**

The company was only established in 2007 but has consistently paid out very high dividends, currently 13.84%. I'm not really sure what to make of this. The yield is obviously very attractive but the fact that they pay out more dividends than they earn in a year is concerning to me. Especially when considering the leveraged nature of this kind of business as they have a total liability to equity ratio around 6.5. How do you guys feel about this?

**Earnings**

I almost didnt look further into this stock after I saw that it was trading at 44 times earnings. The past 3 years have shown poor earnings, but if you average the last 8 years of earnings and compare that to current price we get a PE ratio of 10.17. I'm aware that 8 years is the entire life of the company, and that in these past 8 years MBS has been a hot topic issue. Either way, that averaged P/E ratio warrants a closer look. 

This is where it starts to go over my head. REIT's are classically reactive to changes in interest rates. They have losses in the past 3 years from derivative instruments which they use as a hedge against rising interest, and these losses seem to grow year after year which has made their current PE ratio unattractively high. 

However, consider the fact that Libor 12 month rate is up from around ~0.8 in oct/nov 2015 to ~1.15 today, and consider the fact that the Fed is expected to raise interest rates more than once this year, probably starting in march. These losses from derivative instruments should shrink away, and potentially even turn them into profits as interest rates go up. If not for these derivative losses the shares would be priced at about 5-6 times earnings. 

   Also consider the fact that 78% of the mortgage backed securities owned by the company are guaranteed by government agencies like GNMA or Freddie Mac. So while rising interest rates will probably decrease the book value of these assets, the revenue they produce is guaranteed. Higher interest rates also means opportunity to acquire higher yielding mbs in the future.

**Conclusion**

There are too many suppositions above for me to make a solid conclusion. It seems like a good opportunity to me based on its net assets per share alone. However, the dividend payments seem unsustainable and the currently low earnings are concerning. I've rationalized an expected increase in earnings, but I admit my knowledge of derivatives and swaps is extremely limited.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! I'm sure I'm missing a lot here, help me fill in the blanks.",6,1.0,1456512459.0

It should be clear that I do thin SDRL is a buy at the price they are at, although it might take time to unlock some value it will by most likelihood get priced accordingly eventually as SDRL weathers the depressed market. Price is sometimes the #1 risk-mitigating tool, and in this case it is certainly plays a big part of it. The market has priced it as having slim chance of making it through the storm - although the financials doesn't quite agree.

Since reading up and researching companies, I've stumbled upon ATW and have them valued (probably liberally) at $35 (currently trading at $6.47). I just did a very simple calculation to arrive at this value:

> Total Assets - Total Liabilities - (Net Intangibles if applicable) / Total Common Shares Outstanding

I've looked into their fundamentals and they seem to be in very good position for how small they are ($419 million market cap).

- 0.5 debt/equity
- asset heavy (4.4 current ratio)
- positive ROA, ROE, and ROI
- steadily increasing revenue over the last 5 years
- decreasing overhead expenses as a percentage of revenues for the last 5 years
- increasing operating income for the past 4 years
- use most of their cash to invest in capital expenditures, but still leave some leftover as a cushion

t3_48uocj,What prohibits a hedge fund manager from enriching himself by acquiring a controlling stake in a company with his investors' money and paying himself out a salary from the company in question?,"I'm asking because I stumbled upon a bit of a special but interesting situation (OTC ticker: SDOI) and I'm genuinely wondering what can go wrong here and how I might be getting screwed as a minority shareholder.

So let me describe this situation briefly.

SDOI is a little shell company with ~23 M in cash and ~21M shares outstanding. It has NOLs of around 18M. The (illiquid) shares are currently trading at around $0,90, which represents a discount of almost 20% to NAV.

Now what makes this situation (even more) interesting is that 2 days ago, Standard General L.P. bought out a previously big shareholder (B. Riley & Co) by acquiring about 3.5M shares from them for ~ $1.18 a share. That represents a premium of 30% from where the stock is trading now. After this transaction Standard General L.P. now has 7.3M shares or about a 35% interest in the company.

So clearly, Standard General L.P. sees some value here (and so do I). At $0.90 these shares seem like a very good deal to me. So I guess I'm trying to figure out what the worst possible case scenario might be.

Frankly, the discount that's present here almost seems like it's to good to be true, which is making me very paranoid.

Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.

I noticed they have a negative shareholders' equity for 2014 (725), aswell as in 2013 (82). 

Relevant news to the shareholders' equity is that on 16 December 2014, IHG agrees to acquire Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants for $430 million in cash (According to news releases). In the Annual report it is reported that Net cash flow arising on acquisition is $438 million. (page 112). 

So to my understanding, since Shareholders Equity = Total assets - Total Liabilities. 
3,769 - 3,450 = 319 (For 2015)
2,818 - 3,535 = -717 (For 2014)

Since acquisition of Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants for $430 million was completed in 2015, I figure that the cash outflow starting from 2014 and the gain in the complete intangible asset of Kimpton in 2015 explain the change from negative to position shareholder equity within this time period. 

Assuming my understanding is correct, why is the ROE for 2014 & 2015 shown as N/A , while 2013 ROE value being shown despite it having a negative Shareholders equity ( of -$82m)?

t3_4ab0jn,First stab at a valuation: Activision Blizzard Inc. Comments and criticism welcomed!,"**Investment Thesis**

I am recommending a Buy position for Activision Blizzard Inc. Based on multiple valuation methods, the average fair market value of ATVI is $41.33. Activision is the largest video game firm in the world. It currently controls the entire video game realm with famous franchises including Call of Duty, Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, and the recently acquired Candy Crush. ATVI also owns Major League Gaming, a professional esports organization that hosts major video game tournaments worldwide. I believe they are positioned for a large growth as they enter a new genre of gaming with their Overwatch, first person shooter game. They are also expected to release a movie in 2016 made after the hit franchise Warcraft. And as Virtual Reality systems such as Occulus develop, so too will ATVI build games for that arena.

**EIC Analysis**

**Economy**

The markets have been very volatile at the beginning of 2016 giving ATVI a YTD return of nearly -18% while the S&P 500 only suffered -5%. The economy for video games is still very strong and worldwide. Four out of five households owned a video game console in 2014 and the U.S Computer and Video game sales have been increasing, even through the financial crisis.[1] Over the last five years, ATVI has had a total return of 200%, outperforming the S&P 500 by near 4x.

**Industry**

The video game industry is in a mature state characterized by cyclical growth and strong competition. The industry relies on constant new releases of popular video games to attract consumer sentiment and fuel demand. Over the last decade we’ve seen a large shift over to “social games” being played on devices that connect to the internet. Sales are largely generated through new channels that incorporate downloadable content, in-game purchases, advertisement revenue, and subscription fees. Esports has also risen to play a major role in gaming industry. MLG hosts professional competitions in CounterStrike: GO, Call of Duty, DOTA 2, Starcraft, and Halo. The amount of live viewers for esports events overall have been increasing over the year as we see more and more international competitive play amongst new games. Last year, the largest esports event reached 36 million in 2015.[2]

**Company**

Activision is primarily driven by the sale of its video games. They have large market shares in all types of gaming systems including mobile, console, and PC. They recently acquired King Digital, producer of Candy Crush, the top downloaded game in the iOS store in 2015[3] and ranked #6 in the highest grossing app.[4] They are also known for World of Warcraft, the largest Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game in the world which hit a subscriber base of 12.5 million players in 2012[5], and are currently reaping a base subscription fee of $15 per player per month. Last year, ATVI generated around $4.6B in revenue while King generated around $2B. Together in 2016, they are expected to generate around $6.5B.

**DCF/NPV Valuation**

A DCF model was created to estimate ATVI’s net present value . The following assumptions were made: a 6% projected growth for 2016 from the completion of the King Digital acquisition, revenues from mobile would grow from last year as the smart phone industry grew, and a conservative yet consistent year-on-year growth between 1-2% for the next 10 years with a terminal growth rate of 2%.

http://i.imgur.com/gWPUcvy.png

http://i.imgur.com/F8EV8z5.png

http://i.imgur.com/FRFlflg.png

ATVI historically has no debt. They recently took on debt for the purchase of King Digital and has been paying it down annually. I project this debt will be completely paid off in the future and accounted for that in our assumptions. Their NPV and Share price is highly affected by the discount rate and growth rate. As they move away from debt and towards full equity, their value increases.

http://i.imgur.com/ET5nK59.png

http://i.imgur.com/jQMU5K0.png

WACC Calculation: http://imgur.com/ZngMxuo

**APV Valuation**

An APV model was also created to account for their change in capital structure. ATVI went from historically no debt, to taking on close to $5B in debt on their balance sheet after acquiring King Digital. Their long-term debt has decreased this year. I'm inferring that ATVI does not tend to take on debt and will pay this off. Therefore, an APV valuation would reflect a closer accurate towards the company’s intrinsic value. The APV value for the firm came out to $33.10 per share. The below picture shows the APV projected cash flow and tax shields. This is under the assumption that ATVI does not take on anymore debt or acquisitions and continues to gradually pay off their current debt.

http://i.imgur.com/Ils2Hw1.png

http://i.imgur.com/BjDWAKO.png

**PE EPS Multiple Valuation**

The last method of valuating ATVI was to project the EPS growth over the next 10 years and multiple the terminal EPS by the forward P/E ratio. Their Price-to-Earnings ratio is currently 25.63. Their expected EPS in year 2025E is 1.65. This is using a conservative approach assuming their outstanding shares remain constant. Using the projected DCF model as a base, the estimated fair value based on the PE EPS multiple was $42.27.

http://i.imgur.com/dyZ61KK.png

**Technical Analysis**

Based on technical analysis, the stock has dropped almost 20% from its 52-week highs. On the monthly chart, we can see a very strong convicting bounce off the 20-day moving average. The moving averages are ordered in a bullish manner and the most recent red candlestick shows very strong buy volume from its long tail.

http://i.imgur.com/XW30axX.png


**Conclusion**

Activision is expected to have a huge boost in earnings this year due to the King Acquisition. I expect growth to subside the following year but remain stable as mobile games grow slowly with console and PC. Outside of mobile, I project 7% growth in PC revenues and 9% growth in console games over the year. Operating margins have increased slowly since 2014 and will expect to grow on average 1% a year. The recommend fair value price is based off three different valuations that all result in a higher expected share price. I expect ATVI’s share price to increase by 20% over the next 10 years in a neutral to bullish economy.

t3_4awmqt,Valeant won't be able to repay its debt without shedding assets,"Here's a great writeup about Valeant's current balance sheet position: http://seekingalpha.com/article/3959397-valeant-gaffe

I think this is the death knell for Valeant. The technical default that has been plaguing the headlines is a non-issue. As long as they can release the 10-k on time, they will be fine. 

**DEBT**

The real issue is their cash flow. Valeant made $6 billion in debt repayments in 2015, and they only have $1.5 billion in cash remaining. Somehow, they'll have to come up with $4.5 billion without borrowing more, as the finance cost will be prohibitive due to bankruptcy risk. 

In 2017, term loans of $600m will come due. In 2018, $4.4 billion in term loans and a drawn revolver will come due. 

**EARNINGS**

Earnings guidance is $1.35-$1.55. That's roughly $400-$500 million in earnings. Assuming you can trust their numbers. They have no plans for further R&D or acquisitions, so what you see is what you get.

Management guidance is $1.5 billion in incremental revenue from new drugs until 2020. If we can take those numbers at face value, we can expect to see earnings rise to $750 million by 2020.

**ASSET SELLOFF**

Valeant has spent a total of $27 billion in acquisitions over the past decade. Keep in mind that these were acquired at a premium and likely fair value, so they're not going to command much more than that in a sale. Ignoring the fact that some of these, e.g. Sanitas, seem to be worth less than they appear. 

Valeant has $30 billion in debt. That means that even if it sold of all its assets, it wouldn't be able to settle all its liabilities. 

**CONCLUSION**

Basically, Valeant is going to be treading water for the medium term. It might be able to survive bankruptcy, but at the cost of squandering shareholders. With no way to increase revenues except via organic growth, all profits will sucked dry by finance costs and repayments. 

The company is probably going to just keep its head above the water line for the next 5 years, until it can start considering acquisitions again. 

Meanwhile, expect major shareholders to significantly dilute the company, providing a much needed lifeline while raising their stakes. A lot of egos are at stake here. 

But wait, there's more...

**ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES**

What I've just described is the best case scenario. As we've seen in the past, guidance supplied by management may or may not be trustworthy. For instance, if the $750 million in earnings doesn't materialize by 2020... we've seen how they've fudged Sanitas' numbers before.

To tack on to the existing problems, expect a large settlement with the SEC in the coming years. Probably before the 2018 debt repayments come due.

t3_4awmk3,[Question] Beta of DCF-Valuation,"Hey there, I am playing around with some valuations and I am trying to build my own ""prototype"" on how to value a company so I understand everything better.

My question is concerning the Beta which is used to calculate the cost of equity. 

Do I have to use the Beta from CAPM? 

I see my investing style more as a value investor and i therefor don't care so much about standard deviation and its correlation to the market portfolio. Is it possible to use a company Beta that only looks on the company itself? (I would look at things like PB-ratio, leverage, performance in bad years, future threats etc.)
I can still look at the correlation of the stock with my current portfolio afterwards...

t3_4bhvi2,Let's discuss Chevron [CVX] in the greater context of the energy sector.,"Let's talk about the energy sector. It looks like oil has rebounded from it's near $20 low, back to the $38-$40 range. While still low, this allows a lot of the energy sector to minimize losses. US reserves have gone down for the first time in months perhaps signaling a shift that we've hit the bottom and are on the way up.

Chevron out all of the energy majors has some of the lowest debt to equity ratings. This means that even if these prices persist and debt obligations bankrupt a lot of the smaller players Chevron should be in the clear. It may even be able to acquire smaller rivals who go bankrupt for cheap. On top of that Chevron has a lot of its revenue coming from refinement, of which the major capital cost is the cost of oil. With oil prices depressed, it actually boost profit  generation from its refinement arm.

 It has a dividend yield of 4.44% which gives reasonable returns even in the absence of oil rebounding within the next year. However if oil does return to $80 a barrel it stands to profit handsomely.

However just today Chevron was downgraded by Raymond James from Outperform to market perform.

With all of these positives going for it, why the downgrade? What am I missing here?

EDIT: Would just like to add that I've completely changed my stance on oil. Sold all my CVX yesterday (good thing too, todays drops are pretty steep). I was listening to Art Berman talk about the future of oil in this podcast and one thing that stuck with me was his insistence on oil not being able to rally until our reserves dropped to < 80%.

t3_4boj7w,ROIC<WACC Value Destruction Conundrum,"Hey guys, my mind is currently wrapped around this basic idea that when the ROIC of a firm is lower than its WACC, it destroys value. Of course this is true if you assume unlimited funds to invest. I use the following example to explain this principle and why it does not hold under capital constraints on investment. I implemented the S&P 500's historical return of almost 10% for the WACC as I am not a fan of beta and use profit instead of NOPLAT for simplicity's sake. In this example the invested capital is the only cost of business - i.e. I spend all cash on sugar, lemons, and water, then sell all of it as lemonade, re-up and do it again.

Ex: Lemonade Stand. I have $1 and can either invest it in this business which has an annual ROIC of 9%, or invest it in the S&P500 and get 10%.

Lemonade Stand in Year 1:

Invested Capital (lemons, sugar, water): $100,
Revenue: $109,
Profit: $9,
ROIC=9/100=9%

S&P 500 in Year 1:

Invested Capital: $100,
""Revenue"": $110,
""Profit"": $10,
ROIC: 10/100=10%

So in year 1, by investing in the lemonade stand instead of the S&P 500 I have destroyed $1 of value. Very straightforward but here is where I get lost. As growth increases, the business with ROIC below WACC is supposed to increasingly destroy value but I take issue with this as it assumes that the investors have unlimited funds to generate these returns on. Let's say that my entire net worth is $100 before Year 1, so I cannot invest further in the S&P 500 even if I wanted to. 

Let's say that in Year 2, growth increases in the lemonade stand to such a level that I turn over inventory twice in the year.

Start of Year 2:

Lemonade Stand
IC1- $109,
Revenue1- $118.81,
Profit1- $9.81,
ROIC=9.81/109=9%,
IC2- $118.81,
Revenue2- $129.5,
Profit2- $10.69,
ROIC for second turn-$10.69/118.81=9%,
Profit for year: $20.5


S&P 500:

IC- $110,
""Revenue""- $121,
""Profit""- $11,
ROIC- 11/110=10%

So here is the issue. I only had $100 to start, so I couldn't invest anything more in the S&P 500 in Year 2. On the other hand, I retained all earnings from the lemonade business, increasing the effective invested capital and increasing profits despite ROIC remaining constant. This led to increased value generation on the year. Despite the opportunity cost (WACC) being higher than the ROIC of the business, value was increased through growth.

Please let me know if I am missing something, but under capital constraints, the assumption that if a firm's ROIC<WACC then value is destroyed with increased growth can be false. Of course if I had the same invested capital for both investments then the lemonade business would have destroyed more value in year 2 than in year 1 through its growth. In a public firm this value destruction rule would nearly always apply, but to a small investor who has the option of starting a business or any investor with limited funds it can be very false.

Looking forward to responses.

**Quick Summary (Long Thesis)**

Vasco Data Security International develops anti fraud and authentication solutions for access to its client's data. Their primary products is DigiPass - a complete security product for central or mobile data. Vasco's primary market is the banking industry, where they are the leader in providing security software solutions.

The software security industry offers excellent opportunities for sustained competitive advantage via moats. Customers needs are often specific and niche, providing the opportunity for custom solutions. These solutions, once implemented, will face high switching costs to an alternative. The risk of switching a security solution is just too high, especially for businesses in the financial industry.

Price competition is fierce, as the market is fragmented with numerous firms offering bids with their technologies. Security certifications and customer relationships offer a barrier to entry for new competitors. High margins and steady ROIC show that Vasco has been able to withstand competition over the last 10 years.

For the last 5 years, revenue forecasts have never missed by more than 10% and have been cautious. Operating margins have held above 10% and have increased over the last few years which shows management's commitment to good capital allocation. Vasco holds no long term or short term debt. It's growth is purely through its cash flows. Their highest operating expense is their headcount, which has been adjusted by management based on the economic climate. In 2016, management will be increasing headcount for fuel their growth divisions.

Using a DCF from free cash flows, with the historic ROIC of 15% and reinvestment of 30%, WACC of 10%, the intrinsic value of VDSI sits around $30. **Steady ROIC and improving margins, steady R&D, increasing cash flows, along with zero debt and the valuation make VDSI an attractive investment.** Furthermore, the current P/E of 14 sits near a 5 year historical low of 10. 

Overall I am confident about their financial strength and margins. I'm not as certain about the strength in their technology and their growth prospects; I believe this is offset by the increase in demand for digital security and the moat offered by the financial sector. What are your opinions? Would appreciate a critique on my thesis and analysis. This is my first shot at a DD writeup and am looking to improve.

t3_4cgmq5,Discussion of Net Net: Emerson Radio (MSN),"DISCLOSURE: I own a small stake in MSN. I am trying to decide whether it should become an normal sized position in my portfolio or if I should dump it.

After reading Deep Value by Tobias Carlisle I decided to see if there are any net nets currently available. I used the following Finviz Screener Criteria: Country: USA, Price/Cash:  Under 1, Debt/Equity Low (<.1). There are a lot of financial and biotechnology stocks that are not really net nets but show up. Emerson Radio is the stock I was most comfortable declaring a conservative liquidation value because the company's cash and short term investments are much higher than the liabilities.  
In Thousands
Cash and Cash Equivalents: $27612
Short Term Investments (CD that paid out in 1/16): $20114
Total: $47726

Total Liabilities: $3217
Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference: $3677
Total:6894

Net Cash Value:$47726-$6894= 40832
Diluted Shares outstanding=27130
Net Cash per Share: 40832/27130=1.50504976
Current Share Price: .90
Market Price  to Liquidation Value ratio: (.9/1.50504976)*100=59.79869%

If I assume the assets of MSN are worth absolutely nothing the company trades below Ben Graham's rule  of 66% to liquidation value. When I realized this I bought some shares. 

Then I did more research and what I would like to discuss in the thread is how to take the analysis to the next level and determine whether the cash level will stay around this level and whether there will be a catalyst for a change. The historical burn rate is not relevant because Emerson Radio just lost one of its major customers (Target or Walmart) that accounted for a lot of its revenue and lost its licensing deal which also accounted for significant sales. 

For a catalyst, the company's majority share holder (about 56%)is a subsidiary of Grande Holdings, a Chinese firm in the middle of restructuring. They seem to not care about the company as revenues have decreased significantly, will continue to decrease due to loss of customer and licensing deal, but expenses have some how increased. 

In conclusion, I was so excited to find a net net with such a conservative liquidation value, but looking through the proxy statement and the most recent 10-q made me think this was a bad decision because the company looks like it will burn cash very quickly and the majority shareholder seems to have abandoned the company. From reading Deep Value I know that net nets are supposed to be really bad dying companies. Is Emerson Radio a normal net net that looks horrible but will realize this liquidation value? I guess the crux of my question is how do I learn to do a deeper analysis to determine the probability that liquidation value will be realized in this case and other net net situations.

Thank you.

t3_4e0xnf,I need help with an intrinsic value calc,"Boys, I need your help with two excel calculations.

&nbsp;

This YouTube channel (Buffet Books, https://www.youtube.com/user/BuffettsBooks/videos) has a video where they calculate the intrinsic value of Disney Stock (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1wbCieoHs4). The video provides a link to an intrinsic value calculator: http://www.buffettsbooks.com/intelligent-investor/stocks/intrinsic-value-calculator.html#sthash.AMbFBwT8.dpbs I would like to understand the formula used in this calculator (preferably in an excel equation). It’s black box on the site.  

&nbsp;

**The calculator uses these variables:**  
- Cash Taken out of business ($) (This is dividends received for 1 year)  
- Current Book Value  
- Average Percent Change in book value per year (%)  
- Years  
- Discount Rate (10 year federal note)  

&nbsp;

**He uses these values in the video:**  
- Cash Taken out of business: $0.60  
- Current Book Value: $21.21  
- Average Percent Change in book value per year: 6.924%  
- Years: 10  
- Discount Rate: 1.71  

&nbsp;

**Resulting in an intrinsic value of: $40.43** How does this calc spit out $40.43? What formula is used? I found this formula here: http://www.buffettsecrets.com/intrinsic-value-graham-formula.htm IV=(Ex(8.5+2G)X4.4)/Y but I don’t know how to apply the values used in the video to this formula.  

&nbsp;

Second question. There is actually a calc that you have to solve first, before you can start the intrinsic value cal: http://www.buffettsbooks.com/intelligent-investor/stocks/intrinsic-value-calculator.html#sthash.AMbFBwT8.dpbs You have to work out the Average Percent Change in book value per year (%)  

&nbsp;

**The calc on the site asks for these variables:**  
- Current Book Value ($):  
- Old Book Value ($):  
- Years between Book Values:  

&nbsp;

**He uses these values in the video:**  
- Current Book Value ($): 21.21  
- Old Book Value ($): 11.61  
- Years between Book Values: 9  
- Resulting in: 6.924%  

&nbsp;

Now if you work these out using the values given in the video it doesn’t add up.  

&nbsp;

Book Value | % Change |
---------|----------|----------
$11.61|----------|----------
$11.82|1.81%|----------
$13.05|10.41%|----------
$13.06|0.08%|----------

$15.67|1.62%|----------
$17.73|13.15%|----------
$18.55|4.62%|----------
$19.78|6.63%|----------
$21.21|7.23%|----------

&nbsp;

Average the % and you get 6.36%, not 6.924% Who is wrong?

t3_4eaeyx,Thoughts on Marty Whitman's balance sheet focused valuation?,"So I just purchased Marty Whitman's ""The Aggressive Conservative Investor"" and he seems to give primacy to the balance sheet by focusing on NAV. Using this alone, it seems that it would be extremely difficult to find ""undervalued"" companies. I understand that this is extremely conservative and risk adverse but this still does not provide the intrinsic value of the company, which takes into account of cash flows. As such, using his valuation method will not give me the intrinsic value of the company. Additionally, it doesn't appear that his returns are fantastic.

3pm: Value Investing Panel at Creighton University
5pm: Yellow BRKers get together
Columbia University “From Graham to Buffett & Beyond” dinner????

Saturday, April 30:
8am-4pm BRK AGM. I’m watching a 85 and 92 year old take questions for hours.
5:30pm: I might attend the Nebraska Furniture Mart Cookout. It was a lot of fun last despite the long line to get in. Music, BBQ and Budweisers. BTW  Nebraska Furniture Mart which is the largest furniture shop in the US.

t3_4esrrn,Warren Buffett got this one wrong: Beta vs. Margin of Safety,"Found this gem from back in 2001 written by Michael Mauboussin who is now head of Global Financial Strategies at Credit Suisse: http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/marginofsafety.pdf

It's a few page discussion on measuring risk, specifically, Beta vs. Margin of Safety. In short Michael argues that volatility remains a reasonable measure of risk for the short term. Long-term investors are better off considering the ""margin of safety"" concept. He even goes into how Warren Buffet got it wrong.

This is obviously an old article but I believe Michael makes a compelling argument. Would love feedback related to: 

* overall thoughts, agree or disagree?
* do you currently quantify/account for risk in your investing process? How?
* any more recent published research that supports/contradicts Michael's arguments?

I have already made the assumption in calculating the discount rate for ""target"" that the capital structure (D/E) is going to be similar to that of the purchaser. It is important to note that DY is a holding company - the sum of roughly 30 subsidiaries. I have read in Damodaran's lesson about valuing private company's that is is reasonable to estimate a private company's cost of capital assuming that the capital structure is going to be similar to that of the acquirer. However, this may differ in reality. Is this true? Would the capital structure of individual subsidiary differ from that of the parent company, since they are essentially their own entity under an umbrella?

t3_4gus7t,Investment Thesis: SAFM,"Hi everyone,

I bought this stock back in November 2015 when it was at around 69$. I am usually pretty nervous about putting myself out there (who isn't?) and I did do my best due intelligence when I bought it. So i wanted to put it out there and hope that maybe I can learn more about myself or what someone else has to offer. I'm not sure how to write this up so I'll just write up my thought process and some rough calculations for how I arrived at buying in at 68$

SAFM stock price seemed to be beat up due to a combination of factors such as the Avian Flu infecting some chickens in America, export bans, and fears of chicken prices being corrected due to selling at a high price for such a long time. 

Well I decided to see how badly Avian Flu influenced SAFM. Turns out that the bird flu only struck in the Northwest and no cases have been found in the Southeast where SAFM operates. Additionally, the broiler chickens (the chickens raised to be eaten) have never contracted it and were not susceptible to the strain of flu going around. Well I thought the chances of the bird flu not happening are not exactly 0% so there's still a possibility. after all the virus can mutate right? 

The export ban didn't really affect their sales because it accounted for less than 10% of sales and eventually, the ban should be lifted right? Again, it's not 100% sure so maybe we can put it at 50/50.

As for the Chicken price. This I didn't know how to really assign a probability too. Well what if there was a contraction in price? I know that management bought feed and grains at a low cost so that would offset some of the margin they lost on chicken pricing.
Additionally, even if there was a prolonged case lower priced Chicken, I believe SAFM has a good chance of surviving due to their low amount of debt owed (10M$) putting debt-to equity at .01.

What really attracted me to SAFM were a few things. 1) People aren't going to stop eating chicken anytime soon. Again, there maybe a study of how eating chicken causes cancer (I'm just making things up) and the consumption will go down but SAFM's management is good at lower capacity through their plants to offest this and moving to higher margin markets for chicken. At any rate, even with new studies that will show chicken meat in a bad light won't end the chicken industry just like how people still eat red meat. 

2) The management team. This one especially. On top of most employees being enrolled in the stock program and the management having ownership of the company, management has good incentives to try and enhance shareholder value. They have been very disciplined in terms of how they spend their capital. I read through a bunch of the conference calls. Some things I gleaned from itnare that management is moving their operations to the big bird deboning market because of the profitability. Another show of discipline is in their calculations during questions asked in the earning calls for whether to buy back stock, spend on CAPEX, pay down debt, or increase the dividends. They said that building a plant to increase capacity would be equivalent to buying stock at around 38$ which is why they chose to increase CAPEX and not stock buybacks. Additionally, they have a leadership training program where they are training the future leaders of the company in the culture of the company and it's philosophy.

The company's  average ROE is 11% over the past 5 years (including their -25% ROE in 2011). SAFM's situation reminded me of Bruce Greenwald's example of how a company dominating a region will have higher ROE and is in general a better investment. 

The company paid down its debt from 2011 to 2015 going from .54 Debt to equity to just .01 and in 2013 when the debt to equity was at .04 they started ramping up their CAPEX again.

So now for the intrinsic value. I used the DCF on gurufocus.com
I used EPS of around 9.59$ and tried 3 different cases. For all three cases, I assumed growth would happen within 3 years then for the next 10 years they grow at around 3% (to match inflation) I used a discount rate of 10% as my hurdle rate because this is nothing particularly risky about this investment (no complicated financials or business model or high amounts of leverage).

-5% growth for 3 years: in the past 5 years they have posted negative earnings once. So that's 20% probablity if we are looking at a 5 year period. So I have to consider this is likely to happen. Let's say it happened the Intrinsic value would be around 64$. Fine I'll lose money but not much if I buy around 68$.

0% growth for 3 years: this would put it at the intrinsic value at around 75$. So I thought ok if I bought this at around 68-69 yes I could lose money but not much. Plus if this were the case, management to could several things. They could increase dividends, possibly buy back stock, or build more plants. So even though this may happen I wouldn't put it as very likely.

9% growth for 3 years: 9% CAGR is based off of their sales CAGR between 2015 and 2011. So the intrinsic value comes out to around 94$. 38% margin of safety.

So in summary, I saw very little downside based on my estimation for company that was beat down for no reason with a solid management team who is disciplined and knows how to spend their money. Which is similar to the management I saw in ""The Outsiders"" and companies Phil Fisher spoke of. Obviously, just because the price grew, I still need to understand whether it is luck or skill and how I can better enchance my process

Any criticism is appreciated!

t3_4hbtj4,Question about discount rates,"I know that when doing a DCF, the discount rate is supposed to be the risk free rate + an equity risk premium that represents the risk of the company/country/etc. The implication of this is as the risk free rate goes down, asset prices go up, because your discount rate is lower. 


Which leads to the next thing. The lower an asset price is in relation to its intrinsic value, the less risky the asset. The higher the price of the asset, the riskier it is. That leads me to think I should be adding a larger risk premium to the risk free rate when the risk free rate is lower.


If the decrease in the risk free rate is offset by the addition of another risk premium, wouldn't it make more sense to have a constant instead of the risk free rate? If so, what constant should be used? How can it be estimated or calculated? Am I missing anything here?

t3_4h9u4d,MTBC writeup (long),"MTBC writeup (4/29/2016) - Happy to answer any questions

**Overview**

Medical Transcription Billing Corp. (“MTBC” or the “Company”) is a healthcare IT company that serves small to medium ambulatory healthcare practices (i.e. non-hospital, outpatient facilities with 1-10 providers), which account for more than 2/3 of the 500k+ ambulatory practices in the US. MTBC primarily provides revenue cycle management (“RCM”) services, but also offers electronic health records (“EHRs”), practice management, and clearinghouse and centralized electronic data interchange. As of 2015, the Company served 730 practices representing 1.5k providers across 60 specialties and in 44 states.

MTBC is a recurring revenue business with 95% revenue visibility at the beginning of each quarter and 1-3 year contracts with automatic renewals. Customer renewal rates were 79% in 2015, including 99% for customers who are also EHR users, which account for 45% of revenue. The Company is projected to generate revenue and EBITDA of $28.5mn and $1.8mn (6.1% margin), respectively, in 2016 at the midpoint of management’s guidance.

**Valuation**

I’m long MTBC common equity and believe the Company is undervalued at 11x 2016B EBITDA (9x excluding full credit for the federal NOLs, which don’t begin to expire for another 18 years), or 0.7x 2016B revenue. With an enterprise value of only $20mn, MTBC is a small and underfollowed company with low float and low institutional ownership. The Company had a busted IPO in mid-2014, pricing 50% below its intended range, and has seen its share price since decrease by 80%. I think further downside is limited at current levels and the business is at an inflection point in its growth trajectory.

The Company has continued to be punished by investors despite significant operational improvements. Since the IPO in mid-2014, the Company expanded EBITDA margin by 6.5% in 2015 and is projected to expand by 9.1% in 2016B (15.6% total margin expansion from 2014-2016B), has almost fully integrated the three sizable acquisitions made in connection with the IPO, and had its first quarter of positive EBITDA since IPO in Q4 2015.

In my base case (i.e. excluding sizable M&A), I value MTBC at $1.97 per share ($2.20 including full credit for the federal NOLs) based on 10.0x 2017E EBITDA of $3.4mn, which implies 97% upside to current levels (120% including full credit for the federal NOLs), or 2:1 upside by the end of 2017.

Catalysts include (i) financial performance improvement and return to pre-IPO margins, (ii) continued rollup of smaller RCM companies, (iii) acquisition of a larger RCM company in the $10-50mn revenue area, and (iv) increased investor awareness.

**Inflection point in growth trajectory**

Weak financial performance in the last two years (i.e. negative EBITDA in 2014 and 2015) is not an accurate reflection of MTBC’s run rate growth and margin profiles. This underperformance has been largely driven by one-time events in connection with management’s positioning of the Company for future growth.

In connection with its IPO in mid-2014, MTBC made three acquisitions (Omni, Practicare, and CastleRock). This was a transformative time for the Company, with revenue and provider base doubling. EBITDA margin turned negative for the first time in the last five years. Prior to the IPO and three acquisitions, MTBC’s core business (pre-acquisitions) had 7-12% margins from 2009-2012 and 11% in 2013.

Note that the Company is often acquiring struggling and unprofitable businesses that take time to integrate and turnaround, so there is an immediate negative profitability impact (there are also duplicative employees initially). Two of the three companies acquired at IPO were unprofitable. Integration of these three companies has also taken longer than expected, as the three acquisitions comprised essentially nine independently run divisions. As such, management was forced to revise 2015 guidance down twice, which punished the share price.

Management made significant improvements in 2015, with EBITDA margin expanding by 6.5%. In Q3 2015, MTBC raised $5mn of preferred stock to fund growth (note that management spent the entire Q3 getting this deal done, which took longer than expected).

The Company is now at an inflection point in its growth trajectory. With integration of the three companies acquired at IPO largely complete, $8mn in cash on hand, and a shelf registration for $20mn of additional preferred and common stock, MTBC is well-positioned for growth. Indeed, Q4 2015 was the first quarter of positive EBITDA since the Company’s IPO.

MTBC is now planning to focus more on organic growth. Historically, management has focused on initially improving profitability at the expense of revenue retention for acquired customers. This has led to trouble retaining customers post-acquisition. For example, in 2015, the Company only retained 48% of acquired customers from the three acquisitions at the time of IPO 17 months following closing. Customers of the acquired businesses from 2012-2014 (excluding CastleRock) generated a $5.3mn of revenue per quarter at the time of acquisition, which decreased by an average 23% one year post-acquisition. As these acquisitions are largely integrated now, management believes its customer base has stabilized. Management is now focused on customer retention in addition to improving profitability. Regarding the first acquisition of 2016 (Gulf Coast Billing; $3mn in revenue), management noted it “will be the first acquisition where our goal is to increase the revenue” and “[w]e expect to see that revenue at least stay flat if not grow.”

Also, having historically underinvested in sales and marketing (<2% of revenue), the Company hired additional sales and marketing staff in December 2015 and doubled sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue in Q4 2015. I expect this to drive incremental sales going forward.

**Management team aligned with shareholders**

Management and directors collectively own >50% of the Company’s common equity and 1.5% of the preferred equity. The founder / CEO himself owns 47% and 1%, respectively. The Company has been cognizant of shareholder dilution, choosing to issue preferred stock to fund growth since the IPO. The Company also has a $1mn share repurchase program. Management has indicated a preference to not issue new common equity until the Company’s valuation increases (>1x revenue), unless a sizable acquisition opportunities presents itself.

**M&A platform**

MTBC is a platform for rolling up smaller local and regional RCM companies serving smaller medical practices, having made 14 acquisitions since 2006 and entering revenue share agreements with four companies to manage their operations. The RCM space is fragmented with 1.5k+ companies and no single company with double digit market share. Given the ever changing, increasingly complex healthcare environment, it is difficult for many of these smaller companies to adequately serve their customers without significant investment in IT and human capital.

“We are in daily conversations with potential acquisition targets as we continue to work at identifying the very best opportunities to put our growth capital to work. The companies we are talking with, from the very smallest to the largest, are all struggling to hold their ground as the market evolves since they lack the technology and the business models needed to remain competitive…[W]e believe with the IPO market the way it is, with 6 IPOs so far, in one of the slowest and toughest IPO markets, some of these players who were thinking of going public as an exit strategy are finding it hard do so. And so we are talking to a couple of them in the $10 million to $50 million range.” – Management

The Company aims to acquire RCM companies, migrate acquired customers onto its software platform, and improve profitability. MTBC’s ability to lower operating costs post-acquisition largely stems from outsourcing operations (e.g. handling chart capture, payment posting, and follow up) to its call center in Pakistan (1.5k college-educated employees). Management believes its Pakistan-based team costs half of comparable India-based employees and 1/10th of comparable US-based employees.

The Company typically aims to buy companies in the $5-10mn range, it also enters revenue sharing arrangements for smaller RCM companies (under $3mn in revenue) rather than complete actual acquisitions. In these situations, MTBC takes over providing services to customers and pays the RCM company a percentage of the revenue it collects. These agreements have minimal upfront cost and allow MTBC to ultimately pay <1x revenue.

**Value proposition**

Managing the reimbursement process and day-to-day operations is becoming increasingly complex, costly, and time-consuming for small and medium healthcare practices. MTBC’s value proposition is simple: Reduce administrative burdens and ensure proper cash collection while improving clinical outcomes. Benefits to customers include accurate reimbursement, reduced claim denial rates, improved A/R days, and reduced patient no-shows. MTBC’s solutions provide real-time data needed for important decisions, such as insurance eligibility, provider productivity details, and payor benchmarking. Importantly, the larger players in the space (e.g. athenahealth) are not highly focused on practices with 1-10 providers, so there are not many players of scale here.

The Company is a low cost provider with its standard platform fee at 2.5-5% of a practice’s healthcare-related revenue (minimum $1k per provider per month). Thus, MTBC’s incentives are aligned with its customers, as it only gets paid if its customers get paid. Importantly, the Company’s solutions are effective. MTBC’s first-time acceptance rate (i.e. percentage of claims submitted electronically by MTBC to insurers and clearinghouses that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding) was 95% in 2015 vs. an industry average of 94%. MTBC customers’ median days in A/R (i.e. median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by the Company on behalf of a customer and the date the claim is paid to the customer) was 35 days for primary care and 39 days for combined specialties in 2015 vs. an industry average of 38.

**Risks**

Customer retention: The Company has historically had trouble retaining acquired customers, as previously noted above.

Small company: The Company could execute well operationally, but the investor base is currently limited give MTBC’s size, so catalysts may not have their intended effects on the market valuation.

Access to the capital markets: The Company will need to issue additional preferred stock, common stock, and/or debt to fund growth, and in particular, larger M&A transactions.

Compliance: MTBC disclosed a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in its last 10k. The Company also has several related-party agreements with its founder / CEO, which have significant contractual obligations and were not reviewed by the audit committee prior to enactment. I think both of these risks are understandable given the Company’s small size and involvement of the founder / CEO, and MTBC has taken steps to improve controls. However, this is a healthcare company that outsources work to Pakistan, so potential for HIPAA or other violations is elevated.

Debt compliance: At the end of 2014, the Company was not in compliance with its debt service coverage covenant required under its revolver, which was waived by TD Bank, its longtime lender of many years. This facility was later refinanced with Opus Bank, which has three financial covenants: (i) Maximum Senior Leverage Ratio: 2.25x for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and each quarter thereafter; (ii) Minimum Asset Coverage Ratio: 1.30x at the end of each month; and (iii) Minimum EBITDA: $1.05mn for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.",13,0.88,1462120108.0

TLDR: http://simfina.com is a new stock screener w/ integrated backtesting, looking for some feedback on the idea/prototype.

Long-story short you can take a screen and see how it's performed over the last X years vs. the S&P 500. 

I've been working on http://simfina.com for a little while now and I'd love some feedback.

The site functions like a normal screener, you can add filters and tweak them to construct a strategy or idea (TTM P/E less than 15, EBITDA margin over 25%, etc) and see the stocks that currently fit that screen.  Where we try to diversify ourselves from a traditional screener is by giving users the power to see how that screen has performed over the last X years vs. the S&P 500 (more benchmarks to come).  

We're in early alpha so I'm sure there's a ton of bugs, if you guys could help me kink out the errors that'd be awesome!  We don't ask for an email or any personal info, just looking for some feedback on the general idea.  It's half-baked at the moment but if this is something you guys think could add value to your investing routine I'd love to know. 

If you have any questions for me personally you can PM me or email at sam@simfina.com.

t3_4htwez,How do professional research analysts use EDGAR?,"I've been messing around on sec.gov for the past few days after watching this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhISBNDO2Oo

In the video, Martin Shkreli talks about how it's possible to become an expert in an industry after reading SEC filings for 5 years. 

My question is: How do security analysts actually use sec.gov? To clarify this very broad question with some more specific questions:

- Do people actually read an entire 10-K? 

- What other forms are commonly read?

- Where do you find transcripts from 'conference calls'?

- What device do people use? Paper copy (not likely since the 10-K is hundreds of pages)? Kindle? Computer screen?

- Do people only read certain items of the 10-K? (a.k.a. Item 1A 'Risk Factors' might be totally useless most of the time)

- Do people read the 10-Ks in a different order than they are presented? (a.k.a start with the financial statements?)

- Do people typically read about the Company on Wikipedia first before delving into the 10-K?

I could obviously think of dozens more questions, and there are undoubtedly nearly an infinite number of questions that I don't even know to ask, but it would be very helpful if someone could provide some enlightenment on how professional security analysts actually use sec.gov.

t3_4i75yx,Thoughts on Allergan (AGN)?,"I started looking at AGN for a couple reasons--I was impressed that their CEO seemed to see through Valeant (see their May 2014 presentation) and thought the recent sell-off could be due to merger arbs dumping it.  Bull case: they are doing a roll-up the right way.

However, I can't get comfortable with the true cash flow.  They add back $6b a year in amortization to get to their 'earnings' #, but I suspect a lot of that is a real cost of maintaining their business.  They just buy companies rather than do their own R&D/capex.  

On the other hand, if they are just going to milk these businesses rather than reinvest, perhaps adding back the amortization is the right thing to do when looking at the future cash flow generation potential?  But this probably results in a huge falloff in sales/growth at some point.

Anyone have any thoughts on these issue/valuation?",5,0.86,1462569367.0

1. Improve both my security analysis and writing abilities.
2. Provide a tangible product for an audience to interpret, critique, and benefit from.
3. Stimulate original thinking in analysis areas.
4. Signal to employers that my extra-curricular readings provide tangible knowledge, translated into these blog posts.

Additionally, I will be skipping summaries on the fixed income and senior securities with speculative features sections. This is simply because I am far more interested in equities given my risk tolerance and relative youth.

*(numbers rounded up/down)*

Market cap = **2.2b**. 

Total Assets = **2.1b**:   
Current Assets = **1.1b**: *740m cash, 250m ST inv, 80m recv, 45 other current assets.*   
Non-Current Assets = **1.0b**: *PPE 270m, goodwill 650m, other intangibles 60m, other LT assets 20m.*  

Total Liabilities of **340m**: *payables/accruals 90m, deferred revenues 130m, other current liab 20m, other LT liab 95m.*  

Total Equity = **1.8b**: *common 3.2b, retained earnings (-1.3b), others 150m.*

---

So company now has **1.8b** in book value (BV). 

To be conservative, assume we **reduce** it by 270m PPE + 650m Goodwill = (-920m). Then, we **add** 130m Deferred revenues. So we’re left with BV of about **1.0b**.

Based on latest earnings, company *supposedly* has [cash 1.5b + is selling their HQ for 540m]( http://sfist.com/2016/05/05/zynga_hq_officially_worth_more_than.php). Assume that we add the difference to BV, i.e. add (1.5b – 740m) cash + add (540m – 270m) PPE. So that’s adding about **1.0b**.

Add the two together, we get a new BV of about **2.0b**. 

---

Company’s cash flow is healthy. Quarterly profit is still negative at GAAP loss of **(-26m)**, but it’s a big improvement from previous years: *2011 (-400m), 2012 (-200m), 2013 (-37m), 2014 (-226m), 2015 (-122m).* 

Hopefully they stem the loss within 2 years. 

CEO *claims* to be capital-allocation friendly (buzz words: R.O.I., cost-cutting). Don’t know too much about mobile gaming, but his profit forecasts seem okay/reasonable/attainable. 

Assume the company continues to lose **(-100m)** until year 3, then starts turning around with **+100m** annual profits starting year 4. Further assume **+100m** annual profits to perpetuity, with zero growth. Also, assume company has low WACC of 7% (currently [5.26%](http://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/ZNGA/Weighted%2BAverage%2BCost%2BOf%2BCapital%2B%2528WACC%2529/Zynga%2BInc)) by virtue of having good FCF.

> **Summary: (-100m) annual loss yr 1-3, +100m annual profit yr 4-perpetuity, WACC 7%, growth 0%**

Under this scenario, **NPV = 600m**. Add this to new BV, 2.0b + 600m = **2.6b**. Implying 15% undervaluation.

t3_4iql5c,Investment Thesis: TKOI,"Hey everyone,

So here is another one of my ideas for an investment. This one will probably be looked at as more controversial since it is OTC AND a penny stock. I do have a position in it as of almost a year.

For some background, I first came across Telkonet two years ago.  To put it simply, what they do is sell an array of items, such as automated thermostats to save you energy on your heating/cooling bill. Telkonet also sells HSIA (High speed internet) but they have started to phase away from that due to market saturation into the energy savings industry (hotels, schools, hospital) which is high margin (they recently made 55% GM in Q1 2016).

While working at my current job, I found Telkonet after offering to help my boss install some of their thermostat units in a hotel. The thermostats are all connected and synced up to a central unit  where the hotel manager can monitor the energy output of each room. So I'll give some characteristics of this company that I think will make it a good investment

PROS:

High cost of switching: Installing these units is a pain. But uninstalling these units is even more work. So once these units are set up, it will be a long time before a competitor will come and move in on the target so there is a ""stickiness"" there

Economy of Scales: The bigger the project, the cheaper it is for the hotel/school/etc. to save money. The cost to install the units depends on the amount of rooms but the cost of the software (telkonet also is a SaaS company) to monitor the energy output in each room goes down the more rooms there are. That's because the SaaS has a fixed cost and is spread out as the number of rooms increase

Incentives and Proprietary Knowledge: Never forget Charlie Munger said if you should be thinking about anything, its incentives. One thing I learned while installing these units is the amount of money the owner of the property gets from energy savings. This is due to  proprietary  knowledge. Telkonet has patents on their energy saving technologies which makes their products more responsive and quicker to react than other units. I know this due to my boss' knowledge in the industry and also from personal experiences at Hotels when Honeywell's thermostats (Enconn) units really failed to accommodate my temperature settings and didn't adapt very well or quickly. At any rate, due to the patents the managers is able to get a bigger rebate check then just using a Honeywell Encon unit, or Pelican.

Regional Dominance (?): From personal experience, I see salesmen at my office quoting more Telkonet and even customers asking for telkonet on jobs that require a HVAC system. On their most recent quarterly call, their east coast business has increased and I believe that if they can dominate the east coast they will begin to have a healthy ROIC.

Additional comments: I can't speak much for management but I do know that in the past 2 years they have all been buying stocks directly which reassures me SOMEWHAT in the success of this company. 

CONS:

They have been losing money for the past 6 years or so. Although in Q1 2016 they finally removed the ""going concern"" for the first time from their quarterly indicating that their auditors believe that they won't have any shortage of funds in the near future. But I want to keep my eye out on this and see how the company progresses.

Telkonet is in a new industry that is estimated to be worth billions of dollars. I can only find a few competitors. The biggest one being Honeywell (Enconn). I can't find any information on the finances of this unit so I don't know what kind of margins or cash flows to expect. But with Honeywell being such a big player and being able to expense so much to R&D, I wonder how long it will take for them to catch up to Telkonet and match the amount of money they offer on rebates. 

Catalysts: Management has talked about doing a reverse split to uplist the company from an OTC stock to a stock on NASDAQ. Reverse splits seem to be seen in a negative light so maybe most investors will ignore the stock or cause its price to become depressed. The other side is that it will become visible to more institutional investors.

There has been a growing knowledge in Telkonet's products and offerings. This has taken quite a while because the company had/has to go out and train several people in how to install the units, get them to speak to the software, etc. But it seems that recently there are more and more people becoming well versed in the telkonet products (again this is anecdotal on my part) so maybe in the near future we will see a ""critical mass"" in knowledge and installation as people become more efficient at installing these units. 

Closing: Again because this company has been losing money almost every quarter, I don't know how to project cash flows or EPS. So really, I can't even assign an intrinsic value. But with it being one of the first movers in this industry, is there a chance they can establish themselves and gain considerable market share and health margins? Or will they be one of the casualties like the first wave of pioneers who go to explore new lands?

For now I can't determine the answer to either question but I do want to keep my eye out on the company and increase/decrease my position as I receive new information because I think it can have a moat and will have good cash flows

If anyone has any questions or rebuttals please feel free to share!

I've recently fell in love with value investing, and have been reaching out to various people in finance trying to find out how I can get into the industry. 

However, it was recently made known to me that asset management jobs are usually reserved for people from target schools, such as MIT and Harvard. There were many reasons why I chose UMASS, mostly finances, but I also regret not finding out more before I chose my undergraduate. 

I'd like to plan ahead given what I know now. What kind of Master's program should I look into getting into in 3-5 years time, if I'd like to get a job in AM? 

My question isn't about which school I should aim for, so much as which program would be the most appropriate to land a role in 'value investing'. Should I plan to get an MBA? Or would an MsF from Boston College be more appropriate? I don't really see myself getting into Harvard or MIT, but perhaps an M7 school is possible.

I've also been encouraged to get a CFA, but some people have told me that its seen by employers as lesser than a Master's. Is this true, and to what extent is it true?

Any other suggestions would be most welcome. Thank you in advance for your time.

t3_4js7q6,calling insurance company experts - question on reserves for investment portfolio,"Hi, long story short, the company I work for also controls a life insurance company. 

When I asked about them investing in equities for their investment portfolio, I was told that the reserve requirements for what they'd need to set aside for stock investments are 100% at the holding company level, but only 30% if it's done through a subsidiary - he called it ""the service company."" 

He compared this to a 1% reserve requirement for high grade/AAA bonds, explaining that this is why most insurance companies hold mostly bonds.

I thought the reason most insurance companies hold bonds was because of less volatility and ""risk"" ? And more liquid than buying up a bunch of stocks, when they need to sell investments to pay out claims for example.

Can anyone comment on the validity of these reserve requirements? It's a life insurance company.

On the other hand, you hear that MBIA is buying back distressed Puerto Rico debt (which they insured) at huge discounts in its investment portfolio, which effectively eliminates much of their liability if PR defaults. How is MBIA able to do this? I'd think municipal bond insurance regulatory requirements for their investment portfolios would be much more stringent than a life insurance company.",5,1.0,1463507857.0

t3_4k7jtz,Question on Buffett Partnership's incentive structure?,"Buffett's Partnership (BPL) charged no management fees and 25% of profits over annual returns of 6% (hurdle rate) from its investors. So if BPL generated 10% returns in Year 1, investors would pay (10%-6%)/4 = 1% fees on their investment for that year. This means the investors' net return for Year 1 would be 9%. What would subsequently happen in Year 2 if BPL generated 5% returns? 

**Option 1**: Investors pay no incentive fee for Year 2 since 5% is less than the required 6%

**Option 2**: Investors pay an incentive fee of 0.5225% for Year 2. The cumulative gross performance for Year 1 and 2 is (1+9%)(1+5%)-1 = 14.45% - this already factors in the incentive fees paid out in Year 1. The 6% hurdle rate over two years is (1+6%)(1+6%)-1 = 12.36%. Thus the performance over the hurdle rate is 14.45% - 12.36% = 2.09% and a quarter of that is 0.5225%.

I work on the Global Value Team at Schroders. Beren and currygoat have been kind enough to include our [blog](http://www.schroders.co.uk/en/uk/the-value-perspective/) in their online reading list - thank you for the complement!

We are recruiting for a research analyst to join our team to source and research their own investment ideas, and also critique ours. The advertisement is [here](http://www.schroders.com/en/SysGlobalAssets/staticfiles/schroders/sites/tvp/pdfs/research-analyst.pdf).

Here's the plain-text in case you can't access the PDF for some reason:

**Team Overview**
We are six investment professionals who together form the Schroder Global Value Team. We manage over £11bn of equity assets in a contrarian, low turnover, pure value style and are amongst the largest franchises running money this way in the UK. We run income and deep value recovery mandates across UK, European & Global Markets. 

**Overview of role**
As a research analyst on the Value team you will be required to research companies globally to find the most attractive investment opportunities. We achieve this by looking for companies on cheap valuation metrics, typically low multiples of their normalised profits or assets, for reasons which are not justified over the longer term. 

Whilst technical skills such as accounting knowledge and experience in stock analysis are necessary, by themselves they are not sufficient. Intellectual curiosity, an open-minded contrarian mentality and a passion for value investing are essential for the role. 

We are looking for someone who will contribute to the fabric of our team and add to the quality of our debate and analysis. 

You will regularly present your ideas to the team and should expect challenge and critique. We’re also expecting you to apply your good judgement to challenge our ideas. You will need to clearly articulate your conviction and be confident in your analysis, however you should also have the flexibility to change your view if the investment case changes. 

The successful applicant will be a humble, talented individual who wants to work as part of a team. We follow a low turnover patient investment strategy and would expect you to share a similar investment time horizon. Above all else, we want investors with a desire to learn, to develop, and who are passionate about following an unconstrained value investing philosophy. 
  
**Essential Skills**
 
* A strong passion for value investing 
* Intellectual curiosity
* Confidence but not arrogance
* A desire to work as part of a cohesive team
* University degree or equivalent
* Strong analytical skills
* Strong financial modelling skills 
* An understanding of P&L, Cash Flow & Balance Sheet dynamics 
* Ability to plan work load independently
* High computer literacy
* Good presentation skills
* Strong written communication

**How to Apply**

See excerpt below. My question: will the PS rights issuance only occur if there is an increase in a current 5% stake holder? How is this deterring someone with a 5% stake from increasing theirs? 

>
. LOUIS , MO  -- (Marketwired) --  05/19/16  --  Huttig Building Products, Inc.  (""Huttig"") (NASDAQ: HBP) today announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a rights plan as a measure to protect the Company's existing net operating loss carryforwards (""NOLs"") and preserve the Company's ability to use its NOLs to offset future taxable income, without limitation. As of  March 31, 2016 , the Company had Federal NOL carryforwards of approximately  $55 million . The Company intends to seek stockholder approval of the rights plan at its 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The rights plan is designed to preserve the Company's tax benefits by deterring transfers of the Company's common stock that could result in an ""ownership change"" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This would occur if stockholders owning (or deemed under Section 382 to own) 5% or more of the Company's stock increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of outstanding shares of the Company by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period.
In connection with the rights plan, the Board declared a non-taxable dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of the Company's common stock outstanding as of  May 31, 2016 . The issuance of rights will not affect the Company's reported earnings per share and is not taxable to the Company or its stockholders but does cause a significant dilution upon any person or group that acquires ownership of 4.99% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock without the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions. Stockholders who own 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the close of business on  May 31, 2016 , will only trigger a dilutive event if they acquire additional shares without the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors.
The rights plan will continue in effect until  May 18, 2019 , unless the Company's stockholders do not approve the rights plan by majority vote at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or it is terminated or redeemed earlier by the Board, or the Board determines that no applicable tax benefits may be carried forward.
Stockholders of record as of  May 31, 2016  will be mailed a summary of the rights plan. Additional information regarding the rights plan will be contained in a Current Report on Form 8-K and in a Registration Statement on Form 8-A that the Company is filing with the  Securities and Exchange Commission .

WEB subdivides the Generals category into Generals-Relatively Undervalued and Generals-Private Owner.

The Generals-Relatively Undervalued category was described as *""companies that he deemed too large for a single private owner to acquire but that were still undervalued relative to where peer companies were trading.""*

This seems like a meaningless distinction. Shouldn't all companies be valued according to what a single private owner would pay to acquire them? Buffett himself actually references these two separate categories in some of his partnership letters, but I don't see the purpose.

I have a job lined up for afterwards and a good bit of money saved from an internship. Needless to say I am new to securities investing, but have followed it for a while. I opened an account about 3 months ago and put a lot of my money in blue chips, but decided I wanted more risk in my portfolio. Now I am pretty diversified, with a couple of large caps, some mid cap, and am now looking to value invest.

Running some screeners based off of some of Graham's recommended attributes for undervalued stocks, I came across $AIRT. Their financials look pretty decent for their size, but I don't know quite enough about the industry. AIRT essentially operates business units that repair airport tarmac equipment and move freight for shipping services, mostly FedEx. Their current and quick ratios are strong, but their margins aren't ideal as it seems the industry is going through a sort of squeeze. I am going long on them because they seem to be positioned to survive a consolidation in the industry and their previous year, which was less than impressive, looks to have been more of a one-off caused by restructuring and other discrepancies that should be getting ironed out as the new teams settle in. With that being said, their numbers are pretty solid. Highlights:

                    AirT vs Industry

Price/Earnings: 11.6 vs 22

Price/Book: 1.7 vs 6

Price/Sales: 0.4 vs 1.1	

Revenue Growth (3 yr): 7.9 vs 5.7

Net Income Growth (3 yr): 22.5 vs 24

Net Margin %: 3.7 vs 5.1	 		

ROA: 11.2	vs 7.8	 		

ROE: 15.5 vs 27.6

Reason why it is so cheap is that market doesn't like the company because of no growth for some time and market in general is extremely pessimistic of all for-profit education companies + there has been no dividends/share buybacks.

The company itself could grow massively if USA went into recession(then people tend to go to universities to learn more skills, into likes of STRA), the earnings in the last crisis were very high(you can check amigobulls.com).",4,0.7,1465470827.0

""The cash flow statement is the truth serum, Bartel said, pointing to WorldCom as a classic example. They reported tremendous income growth, he said, but if you looked at cash flow net of investing, they were actually hemorrhaging cash. If they're reporting cash flow from operations that's below the net income, he explained, you have to ask what the company is having to invest to achieve that cash flow.""
What does this mean? In cash flow statements, isn't cash flow into investing deducted from cash flow from operations to get a net change in cash? Does the guy in the quote mean that a shady company will dip into its cash reserves to superficially increase its cash flow number and make it look like it's richer or better of than it truly is based on the net income figure?

t3_4pk4tt,"Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) arbitrage opportunities. Identify and scrutinise the suspect loans, buy the securities, and pursue remedies via activist bond actions","Back in 2006 to 2008 was the worst credit underwriting period in history for commercial real estate loans, especially retail assets, that were sold into CMBS pools. The same as for the RMBS sector....But there have been virtually no loans repurchased by the originating banks that reaped millions from fraudulent loan sales as with RMBS.
Why? The CMBS trusts have been rigged by the trust parties (servicers and trustees) that are charged with managing the assets/loans. As a result pension funds, insurance funds, and investors are left holding the bag on hundreds of millions in losses from retail assets because the trust parties are systematically violating the terms and spirit of their obligations under the trust documents, the pooling and servicing agreements and the prospectus.
Take the definition of controlling class in a CMBS for example of how they have rigged the trust....in 2003 when the banks pushed the rating agencies to change the definition of controlling class note holder. The definition use to be the junior most note holder with at least 25% of original principle outstanding PLUS appraisal reduction amounts. In 2003, starting with the BACM deals, the definition began to be just realized losses excluding appraisal reduction amounts. This created an arbitrage opportunity for the servicers and their usually-affiliated controlling class note holders. Realized loss timing and quantum can be controlled by the servicers and their 'out of the money' junior notes became the controlling class for multiple billion dollar CMBS pools, while those more senior notes that are 'in the money' with skin in the game lost control.
There was extensive discussion at the rating agencies behind this change and the arbitrage opportunity against the senior note holders was glaringly apparent. Well the rating agencies approved it of course, in a very Enron-esque environment where senior rating agency staff were sleeping with the bankers, etc...you get the picture.
By 2004 the definition of controlling class was across the board excluding appraisal reduction amounts. By 2005 the crazy underwriting was out of control and by 2006 all rational underwriting standards were out the window. The norm became that banks churn and burn and originate as fast as possible to take the profits, sell the loan, and run. I have numerous examples of banks selling loans with retail collateral where there are inflated appraisal values, undisclosed environmental catastrophes, half completed assets under construction being sold as complete and fully occupied, massive 'cash outs' in loan refinancings being sold as acquisitions, inaccurate historical NOI....the list goes on. Anecdotally, have a look at the number of loans originated in 06 to 08 that were extensively renovated just prior to loan sale to justify lower expenses.
The trust parties conveniently hid and ignored the sins of the originators and perpetuated the non discovery of the violations and now hide behind statute of limitations to bar action. They do this because they earn more from working out the loans, flipping the loans to their affiliates at a discount, and then selling the loans to the open market. Or they hold on to the assets for their own real estate operating companies. This is the biggest wealth transfer in history from second tier wealthy individuals and companies to the top tier hedge funds and private equity firms that now run the CMBS trusts.
When senior note holders try and take remedial action they face multiple hurdles. Firstly they must indemnify the trustee for potential losses associated with the proposed remedial action. Secondly the worried note holder cannot identify or communicate with other senior note holders without the trustees' cooperation. The central registrar of note holders is held by the Depository Trust Corporation, a 'non profit' controlled and funded by about 30 of the worlds top banks. Thirdly they face trading restrictions on an already impaired security because servicers deem the information as insider information-this is a scare tactic that has never been tested to my knowledge.

On the flip side, I see a lot of people recommend index funds and stuff like Vanguard to people like me (no experience with investing, but interested in long term savings). I'm wondering how you guys view something like Vanguard or index funds in general post-debt meltdown. Are they still a good option? Why? I'm confused at how we expect the global economy to continually grow? Surely there must reach some sort of saturation point or some sort of point of diminishing returns?

t3_4qhm7b,WNC thesis,"Hi everyone,

Here to pitch another idea. This time its Wabash National Corporation (WNC). This is a little more detailed and long so I'll provide a brief summary of my reasoning first and anyone can feel free to dive into the math and logic further down below.

Briefly, my thesis relies on two factors: 1) Good Management who allocates capital efficiently by knowing when to buy back shares, pay down debt, and acquire companies 2) Managment is disciplined which is shown in their ability to prefer margin over volume in sales transactions and 3) an inconsistency between the reality of the company (it is becoming  a more diverse company) and the way investors are currently view it (a cyclical trailer company) causing it to be mispriced. I calculate intrinsic value for the company under 4 different cases from its current price of 12.44 USD:

EPS growth at -8%: 10.17 USD (-22% Margin of Safety)

EPS growth at 0%: 12.64 USD (2% Margin of Safety)

EPS growth at 5%: 14.38 USD (13% Margin of Safety)

EPS growth at 10%: 16.28 USD (24% Margin of Safety)  

The more detailed explanation is as follows. Pulling from Google Finance:
""Wabash National Corporation is engaged in designing, manufacturing and marketing standard and customized truck and tank trailers, intermodal equipment and transportation related products. ""

The Company has three segments: Commercial Trailer Products (71% of sales as of 2015), Diversified Products (21% of sales as of 2015), and Retail (8% of sales as of 2015). 

CTP manufactures standard and customized van and platform trailers that the trucks haul. The Diversified Product Group sells products that compliment the trailer business such as liquid tank trailers as opposed to the dry bulk trailers we normally see on the highway. Retail segment is simply the locations owned by the company to sell directly to the customer. 

Now to the meat of my thesis.

In the past 5 years WNCs ratios are as follows:

ROE: 10%	15%	14%	16%	24% 

(In 2012 the company has a restructuring charge of 57 million USD giving ROE of 39% so I removed this charge)

Debt to Equity: 44% 155%	111% 83% 63% 

(they made an acquisition in 2012 but have been paying it off since then)

FCF/share: $(0.12)  $(4.46)	 $1.42  $1.12  $1.91 

Current Ratio: 1.6  2.1 2.1	2.6 2.5

In 2012 WNC acquired the Walker company to expand their business into the diversified products line. WNC claims that:

""through these brands and product offerings, our Diversified Products segment now serves a variety of end markets a number of which we believe are less cyclical than other markets historically served by Wabash""

I think that many investors have yet to see this transition from a cyclical company that sells trailers to a more diversified company because they diversified segment still only makes up 25% of sales. But I believe it will take another 2-3 years for the changes to be fully realized. 

This acquisition and diversification leads me to my next point which is Management. I was looking at managements philosophy on acquisitions and how they make capital allocations. In a conference call in we have management say:

“So we have not backed off on our interest in looking at acquisitions that make sense. I’ve said repeatedly in the past that, we will continue to be strategic in our growth initiatives, but selective. And that meaning that, we will look at a lot of opportunities to add to the business, but we’re not going to acquire for acquisition sake or diversify for diversification sake. It’s all going to be done that make sense to continue to increase value for shareholders with those actions.” (2015 Q4 Seeking alpha)

Well, it seems they are not willing to please wall street which loves a growth story and it seems management is disciplined. But where is the math to back it up? Well, I looked at how they could've spent their capital which was 364 million USD in 2012. Originally, taken out to buy Walker, they could have bought back shares or issued a dividend. 

Issue a dividend: I couldn't find anything in my notes about why they haven't issued a dividend but their philosophy is to maximize shareholder value and I am going to assume that they don't see dividends as a way to achieve that. Again, this is something I noted in many of the top performing companies. Many of them don't pay dividends.

Buy back shares: Between 2012 and 2015, EPS due to the acquisition of Walker has resulted in EPS CAGR of 38.92% (again I am removing the restructuring charge which boosted net income by 57 million USD). If instead they used the 364 million to buy back shares in 2012 for just that year? They would've been able to reduce shares by 49% if they bought at 11.09 (the high of that year). Now I would have to assume that their diversified product line didn't grow at its current rate. Instead I have to look at pre 2012 growth rates and use those rates to determine what the 2015 EPS without the acquisition would be.  I assumed a 5% growth in sales, and 3 % profit margin. 

WNC	               2011	  2012	2013	 2014    2015

Sales	               $1,187  $1,313 $1,357 $1,579 $1,841

Net Income        $15        $39      $41	  $47	    $55

At 36 million shares our EPS would go from .22 USD in 2011 to 1.53 USD in 2015. This is only an CAGR of 11.94%. Way below the 69.92% at which EPS are compounding currently. 

I believe management is disciplined as stated in many of their conference calls such as when the CEO stated: 

""What we have done as the orders were coming in late last fall in droves we were standing very firm and strict on our commitment to favor margin over volume. So we were looking at each one of those and adjusting pricing where we could. Remaining slots we have been extremely tight on scrutinizing just which order opportunities, which code opportunities has actually been converted to orders to get the most price benefit that we could out of them. So we've been very selective. We feel we've done a very good job with that..."" (Q1 2015 Seeking Alpha)

Because of this, margins have continued to increase even though sales have remained flat or decreased. Sales have increased by 11.52% CAGR from 2011 to 2015 while net income has had a CAGR of  28.99% in the same time period.

Management has also discussed paying down long term debt which is compromised of 150 millions USD in notes convertible due in 2018 issued to fund Walker acquisition. As shown in the 5 year financial ratios, WNC has decreased debt to equity from 1.55 in 2011 to .63 in 2015. Along the way, they have also repurchased 4.65 million shares in 2014 and reduce share count by 6%. Which was used for more than to just offset the stock options issued in the past 3 years which totaled a little over 1 million shares. This is something management talks a lot about: choosing between paying down debt, repurchasing stock, and making acquisitions.

**Intrinsic Value**: I used the following assumptions to arrive at my intrinsic values

**Terminal Growth Rate: 3%**

**Terminal Growth Years: 10**

**Discount Rate: 12%**

**Growth Rate Years: 3**

EPS: 1.80 USD

EPS growth at -8%: 10.17 USD (-22% Margin of Safety)

At growth rate of 0%: 12.64 USD (2 % Margin of Safety)

At growth rate of 5%: 14.38 USD (13 % Margin of Safety)

At growth rate of 10%: 16.28 (24% Margin of Safety)

During the final crisis of 2007, the companies worst drop in EPS in one year was 12%. They then posted 3 years of negative EPS. So I will assign the probability of 30% for this loss. Because of the past 10 years we had 3 that were negative. While I don't see another crisis as badly as 2007 looming, I will still assume that they company can lose 8% in EPS. 

Between 2011 and 2015 the EPS CAGR has been 62.92% 

(EPS in 2011 was .22 USD and in 2015 EPS was 1.55 USD). While impressive I don't think that's sustainable so I'd rather assume a conservative 10%. I assign a 10% probability of this happening.

For 0% growth and 5% growth I assume 30% probability and 20 % probability.

So the expected value is: 0.3*(10.17-12.44)+0.3*(12.64-12.44)+0.2*(14.38-12.44)+0.1*(16.28-12.44) = .151

In conclusion, the company has good management to sail it through a tough economic environment through disciplined spending and selling. I believe that in a few years, their integration of Walker will start to take place and bring up sales and margins and reduce their cyclical nature. But in the next few years, there is no guarantee that a downturn in the economy won't hurt their sales and hurt their ability to pay off debt. But as I showed above, the expected value of all the scenarios is positive so even if I lose money in case of a down turn I believe there is a bigger chance for me to break even or make money.

If you have any questions let me know! I'm not completely sure on my analysis so i would appreciate it if anyone saw some glaring holes in my logic

"" The plan to align management and shareholder interests by awarding executives stock options not only was oversold, but also subtly disguised a deeper division between those interests that the options created. Many corporations pay their managers stock options whose value increases simply by retention of earnings, rather than by superior deployment of capital. As Buffett explains, however, simply by retaining and reinvesting earnings, managers can report annual earnings increases without so much as lifting a finger to improve real returns on capital. Stock options thus often rob shareholders of wealth and allocate the booty to executives. Moreover, once granted, stock options are often irrevocable, unconditional, and benefit managers without regard to individual options whose value increases simply by retention of earnings, rather than by superior performance.

t3_4ril2c,Stock/Equity Ratio from Chapter 11 of Intelligent Investor,"I'm reading The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham for the second time, and I came across a ratio in his Bond Analysis section in Chapter 11 called ""Stock/Equity Ratio."" It's basically the ratio of a company's market capitalization to its total debt. He describes it, from the perspective of a bondholder, as a measure of the ""cushion"" that protects bondholders.

Here's the exact quote:

> ""Stock/Equity Ratio. This is the ratio of the market price of the junior stock issues to the total face amount of the debt, or the debt plus preferred stock. It is a rough measure of the protection, or ""cushion,"" afforded by the presence of a junior investment that must first bear the brunt of unfavorable developments. This factor includes the market's appraisal of the future prospects of the enterprise.""

Does this make sense? If the stock price is highly inflated just based on pure growth speculation, then there isn't really a ""cushion"" protecting the bondholders is there? Maybe that the company could raise equity financing to help pay down the debt? But that would only work if stock prices remained high.

I'm currently doing my first valuation of Tower International INC (TOWR), and one thing puzzles me and I can't seem to find an answer. In 2015 Tower released approximately $123 million in tax benefits. Their justification on the 10K is the following:


>We released the U.S. valuation allowance primarily because we believe U.S. automobile production levels will continue at 2015
volume levels until at least 2017. At current U.S. production volumes, over the past two years the Company has achieved U.S.
profits that we believe are sustainable. We have also obtained new business in the U.S. that we believe will increase our future
profitability. Furthermore, lower interest rates have allowed the Company to reduce our borrowing costs and improve U.S. profits
significantly. We expect these positive economic conditions will continue. Therefore, given the positive objective performance of
the last two years coupled with our belief that U.S. production volumes will continue due to favorable economic conditions, we
believe it is more likely than not that we will fully utilize our U.S. deferred tax assets.

I'm trying to understand the motivation behind this, and how I should be interpreting this move by management. Any insight or links for further reading would be immensely helpful.

t3_4sdx0r,Birner Dental Management Services (OTC:BDMS) Writeup,"Originally wrote this on 7/6/2016. Illiquid, micro cap special situation with a hard catalyst (buyout / proxy contest) and brother-on-brother activism. Disclosure: I'm long.

**Background**

Founded in 1995, Birner Dental Management Services (""Birner"" or the ""Company"") is a dental services organization (""DSO"") that manages 69 dental offices under the ""Perfect Teeth"" brand name in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona staffed by 79 general dentists and 33 specialists.

DSOs provide support services (e.g. patient scheduling and administration / back office functions) to affiliated dental practices so that dentists can focus entirely on clinical activities. The Company operates under the typical DSO structure with a management services organization (""MSO"") subsidiary of Birner entering into a 40-year management services agreement with an affiliated dental practice (structured as a professional corporation, or ""PC""). The MSO makes all non-clinical business decisions and employs all non-clinical staff, whereas the PC makes all clinical decisions and employs all clinical staff. The MSO makes money via a management fee paid by the PC. The PC makes money from patient visits (cash or insurance reimbursement). 

Birner is the 15th or so largest DSO by number of locations, though the Company has struggled historically over the last half decade. Revenue has been essentially flat since 2009, growing from $59.3 million to $63.7 million. EBITDA has decreased at a 10.7% CAGR, from $7.2 million to $3.5 million. EBITDA margin has contracted every year except 2012, from 12.1% to 5.6%. 

**Investment opportunity**

With an enterprise value of $37.3 million, Birner is the only publically traded DSO and currently trades at 10.5x LTM EBITDA of $3.5 million. The stock is closely held, with 32.1% collective ownership for executives and board members. Having been traded on the NASDAQ for a very long time, the Company's shares were recently delisted due to non-compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement. Having returned $38 million to shareholder via dividends and share repurchases since 2004, the Company recently had to turn off both under the terms of its new credit facility. While benefiting from a recent event (discussed below), the stock is down 25% over the last five years and 5% over the last 10 years

Why is BDMS an attractive buy now?

In May 2016, three long-time shareholders of >10 years filed a 13D with 34.7% collective ownership (currently 31.1%). The group consists of Mark Birner, Lee Schlessman, and Elizabeth Genty, and there are two very interesting relationships here. Mark Birner co-founded the Company, served as President and Director until he resigned in mid-2014, and is the brother of current CEO and co-founder Fred Birner. Elizabeth Genty is the ex-wife of the current CFO and co-founder Dennis Genty (her shares were awarded in a divorce settlement).

The latest amended 13D filing, including all letters to the board of directors, can be viewed here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/948072/000107997316001044/bdental_13da.htm

The 13D filing included a letter the activist group sent to the Company's board of directors. The letter outlined Birner’s terrible financial performance, excessive management compensation relative to EBITDA, and low EBITDA margin vs. DSO peers, among other concerns. The activist group highlighted the Company’s mismanagement and called for a review of strategic alternatives. Notably, the activist group made public that Birner rejected a buyout offer from Blackford Dental (a DSO) at a significant premium. As a result, the activist group has threatened to launch a proxy fight to replace certain board members if steps to maximize shareholder value are not taken.

From the letter: ""We are aware of at least one serious opportunity in which Blackford Dental Management, LLC approached the Company’s Board with a purchase proposal in the per share price range of $20.50-$23.00 with no financing contingencies, subject to a due diligence review.  This represents a 127%-155% premium above the closing price of BDMS shares of $9.04 on April 20, 2016. We understand that BDMS rejected Blackford Dental’s proposal in a one-line email response from CEO Fred Birner as 'inadequate.'""

In a follow up letter to the board of directors, the activist group mentioned they learned of another buyout proposal at a significant premium that was rejected by the Company ""without any substantive discussions."" The Company responded to the situation by engaging a ""reputable middle market investment bank with significant experience"" in the DSO industry as a financial advisor. In another follow up letter, the activist group called for the identity of the financial advisor so that more potential buyers could engage in diligence. 

There is obviously some bad blood between the activist group and the Company's management. Mark Birner resigned as President and Director in July 2014 for reasons unknown to me. His brother’s only public comment was: ""Well, what I can say about Dr. Birner's departure is that he resigned, and we thank him for his years of effort here at the company."" Since Mark Birner's departure, the stock has declined steadily from just under $18 per share to a low of $9 per share in April 2016. The relationship between Elizabeth and Dennis Genty is likely self-explanatory, as it ended in divorce and Dennis had to give her half of his shares in Birner.

Birner used to be a good company, showing strong financial performance from its founding in 1995 to around 2007-2009, with solid revenue growth and double-digit EBITDA margins. Whatever the reason for deterioration since (recession, increased competition, poor practice management, poor de novo execution, resignation of Mark Birner, etc.), Birner could be a solid DSO platform under the correct ownership.

I think the activist group is particularly well-positioned here to push for a sale and/or get board seats, given their sizable, long-term ownership and the fact that Mark Birner co-founded the Company and previously served as President. With the existence of buyout offers at meaningful premiums to the current share price, I would think it difficult for the management team to justify remaining independent.

**Valuation**

The Company's current 10.5x valuation based on LTM 3/31/16 EBITDA seems appropriate based on where other DSOs have been sold (8-12x area). However, I think Birner's EBITDA is understated and that the “true” multiple Birner trades at is much lower for the correct buyer.

In most the DSO acquisitions I have seen, EBITDA is adjusted for de novos losses over the last 12-18 months and run-rate adjustments based on a mature EBITDA per store profile. Buyers / lenders are generally okay with this approach because there is usually a track record of de novos predictably ramping to profitability and these adjustments actually roll off as they are actually realized. Unfortunately, the Company's recent de novos haven’t performed very well and seem to ramp at a much slower pace than other DSOs, with a number of de novos with negative cash flow >1 year after opening. So, these adjustments likely would never be realized in earnings for Birner based on the current outlook. 

Adding back de novo losses and making some simple assumptions for run-rate maturity profiles, I get to an LTM multiple of 7x. Assuming the Company's cost structure is rationalized, the take-out multiple is closer to 5x. So there is some implicit downside protection here given the possibility of a buyout.

Blackford Dental's preliminary buyout proposal of $21.75 per share (at the midpoint) is a ~50% premium to current levels and values Birner at 14x based on LTM 3/31/16 EBITDA. I'll use this as my base case.

The downside here is that a sale does not occur and/or the activist group does not win any board seats should they engage in a proxy battle. My downside is $10 per share (~30% downside), or around where the stock traded prior to the 13D filing. I think financial performance has bottomed or is close to bottoming; the Company is focused on managing costs and rationalizing de novo investment. DSOs are attractive platforms for PE buyers, and they go for full multiples, so I think there is reasonable margin of safety here. Even a struggling DSO like Smile Brands should fetch a good multiple. Other downside is that there is something fishy going given the relationship between management and the activist group, but I do not have that level of insight here.

Aside from a sale or board seat(s) for the activist group, longer-term catalysts, assuming financial performance improves, include reinstatement of the dividend, continued share repurchases, and re-listing on the NASDAQ.

t3_4sim6f,[Beginner] How do I know when to sell?,"I'm a 17 year old value investor. I've been interested in value investing for quite a while now, and I've been investing a few hundred dollars of my own money for the past couple years. 

Anyway, last year, around this time, I bought about $500 worth of Century Aluminum (CENX) for $5.81 per share. I chose it because it was an aluminum stock that was selling for less than book value and seemed very solid structurally, but had been hammered by the market because of the sharp decline in aluminum prices as a result of China's overproduction. It was obvious it was selling for less that it was worth, and I spent all my money on it. The stock got hammered immediately (I remember once it dropped more than 20% in one day) but the opportunity was obvious. But at the beginning of this year, it had made a recovery and I had a tidy 50% profit. Then it tanked again and I was at around an 11% profit. Now it's back up and I'm making around 35%. This was a very long explanation, but what I really want to know is when I should sell. I'm perfectly happy with a 35% return. Anyone would be, but the problem is that I never came up with an actual true value of the business because it seemed like a pointless exercise. All I knew was that it was selling at a very steep discount. It's still selling for less than book value according to Finviz, but I'm feeling a bit uneasy. 

I don't want to ""give up a certain good for an uncertain better"" as Machievelli said. And I'm also worried about getting too greedy. Does anyone here that's more experienced than me and has a good track record have some advice for a young investor? Thanks in advance!",8,1.0,1468348774.0

Just to be clear, I am a leaner and amateur in this field so my valuation certainly has a lot of flaws and one of the reasons I post it, it's because I want someone (possibly analysts and people in the finance) to point out where I am missing.

A quick recap of my assumptions:

Revenues growth 25% for the next 5 years, and declining to 3% in year 10, after become a mature company.
unlevered beta 100% from internet sector firms average.
Country risk premium 100% from China as stated by the financials.

I valued the company in RMB curreny, once obtain the value per share in rmb I just divide by 6.70 to have the value in USD.

Text behind paywall:

U.S. companies that rely solely on standard accounting to report their financial results are in the minority, and their numbers are shrinking fast.

Just 29 companies in the S&P 500 index—or 5.7% of the total—closed their books for 2015 exclusively using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. That’s a sharp decline from 25% in 2006, according to research firm Audit Analytics.

The purists are dwindling as companies struggle to increase their earnings in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, analysts and accountants say, and regulators are taking notice.

The adjusted, or customized, figures many finance chiefs use to supplement their company’s standard financial reports inflate income by an average of 44% at profitable companies, according to new research by financial-data provider Calcbench Inc. Adjustments can exclude the effects of such factors as currency swings, noncash charges like restructuring costs and one-time charges.

That can help mask the impact of tepid global economic growth, which has left many businesses unable to raise prices and hindered sales growth.


In many cases these companies have exhausted cost-cutting options.

“As the economy slows or grows companies are incentivized to provide more or less [customized] metrics,” said Angela Newell, partner at accounting firm BDO USA LLP.

“If everything is rosy and GAAP looks great, there is no need to include a non-GAAP metric,” she added.

Finance chiefs who don’t use adjusted figures say they are furnishing investors with a candid snapshot of their company’s financial performance.

U.S. companies are allowed to report non-GAAP metrics so long as they are labeled, justified and reconciled with comparable standard accounting figures, but there is little oversight of how these adjusted figures are calculated.

“What one company says is adjusted might be different to what another company says is adjusted…It lends itself to inconsistency,” said Andrew Clarke, finance chief at logistics services company C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. “We believe in providing [stakeholders] with a clean number as to how we perform so that they can make an informed decision.”

C.H. Robinson is one of the few S&P 500 companies that reports results using only standard accounting. That group includes retailer Home Depot Inc., financial-services firm Charles Schwab Corp. and technology giant Apple Inc.
Home Depot relies on standard accounting measures not only for earnings reports, but also to guide stakeholders on sales and earnings growth, according to finance chief Carol Tomé. “By doing this, there is never any confusion about the starting point,” Ms. Tomé said in an email.

The common practice of tweaking financial figures has contributed to the ballooning disparity between earnings calculated using standard and non-GAAP accounting, according to Calcbench’s analysis of the 816 U.S. public companies disclosing adjusted financial results in their most recent fiscal years. That analysis is set for release Tuesday.

For profitable companies, common adjustments yielded a $94 billion improvement on top of the combined $214 billion in GAAP net income they reported for the year, according to additional analysis by Calcbench and The Wall Street Journal.

Unprofitable companies got a bigger boost than profitable ones, the joint analysis showed.

Among 328 companies reporting net losses for the year, the adjustments improved non-GAAP results by a combined $65 billion, or about 70% of their aggregate net losses of $93.5 billion.

Adjustments varied widely by sector, Calcbench’s study found.

Financial firms made the biggest adjustments, at $40 billion, more than two-thirds of which related to acquisitions. Tech firms made the most adjustments, about 1,500 among 196 companies totaling $34 billion, 61% of which related to stock-based compensation.

Restructuring dominated energy- and industrial-sector adjustments.

The widespread use of adjusted accounting figures has drawn scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC Chairman Mary Jo White has warned against giving adjusted earnings more prominence than standard numbers, because it might mislead investors. In May, the agency issued new guidance on using and publicizing non-GAAP measures and signaled it may issue new rules to curtail the practice.

Proponents say that supplementing standard accounting with customized figures benefits investors. One-size-fits-all accounting can overlook industry-specific information like funds from operations, a common term for real-estate investment trusts that zeroes in on cash flow. They argue that adjusted figures can strip out the impact of one-time events, like an asset sale or sharp currency swing, allowing investors to see underlying business trends.

“I think non-GAAP can be valuable for investors, as long as it’s not abused by management,” said Bill Zerella, CFO at Fitbit Inc. Fitbit breaks out the impact of stock compensation and amortization of intangibles, he said.

Analysts and investors can “use it to better understand the business,” Mr. Zerella added.

Other CFOs, like Red Hat Inc.’s Frank Calderoni, say they report customized accounting figures because analysts or stakeholders request it. “Companies that do use non-GAAP have to be very clear in discussing what the differences are,” he said.

While many companies use customized accounting to give investors additional insight, “not all of them are that altruistic,” said David Middendorf, a partner at KPMG LLP. “There are certainly companies that use non-GAAP measures to tell a different story than maybe what the real story is,” he said.

In correspondence made public between January and May, SEC staffers queried 80 companies on the use of non-GAAP reports, according to Audit Analytics.

Officials have indicated such queries have picked up in recent months, though there is a delay before the letters are made public.

“This is one of those areas where there’s going to be a back and forth,” said BDO USA’s Ms. Newell. “As the SEC cracks down on it, I think you’re going to see fewer [instances of customized accounting], but as the SEC stops talking about it, companies are going to become bolder and report more.”",20,0.88,1469042689.0
t3_4ts52g,Intelligent Investor. Overrated?,"I'm reading The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham, and I'm kind of disappointed. The first half of the book is mostly just stock market psychology. The difference between investing and speculating, Mr. Market, and various such vague aphorisms. It's not that I don't agree with the general sentiment, it's that it's so well known and somewhat obvious. Stay rational! You must do your due diligence! Kind of John Madden-esque: ""Well you know if you get the ball in the end zone, that's a touchdown."" (*Madden Voice*)

You could say that the proper psychology is ""necessary but not sufficient"" for successful investing. But guys like David Einhorn are successful because of their intensive fundamental analysis, and I was hoping to see more of that in the book.

In the second half of the book, he does get into some individual security analysis, but it's mostly just surface level financial ratios type of stuff. For example: take the 30 stocks in the DJIA, and subject them to a screen for P/B, Current Ratio, long history of dividends etc. and you're left with 12 companies. Buy those 12 companies. 

This is a more purely quantitative style of investing, and I'm not sure if I believe that it's useful nowadays. Surely, some guys like Cliff Asness are successful with similar strategies, but it seems like for guys coming into the business it'd be easier to make your edge by reading lots of 10-ks and industry reports, and really just getting to know a company and it's key drivers, and eventually after 100s of hours, getting a usable insight. Anyone can apply a stock screen, but not everyone is willing to devote 100s of hours to analyzing a single company/industry.

t3_4ufjxc,Trupanion (TRUP) - Pet Insurance,"I have been toying around with TRUP's revenue model for a while after coming across the company's annual shareholder letters (great reads, btw).  Essentially, they aim to be the GEICO of the pet insurance market that they argue is under-penetrated due to dysfunctional incentive structures by market participants and overall poor product quality.  

Uniquely, they are targeting vets by promising same day payments on claims with little to no paperwork/push-back with a cut upfront for the referral.  Apparently, pet insurance stands at just 1% penetration here in the US vs. 25% in the UK and 40% in Sweden.  They contend it is because lack of buy-in from service providers (i.e. vets) so getting them on-board is key to strategy.  

The model’s economics appear compelling at first glance with >50% IRRs (ex. G&A) on customer acquisition costs spent to bring on new members.  As G&A is relatively fixed, the scale affect on operating income is powerful as they march towards efficient scale of an estimated ~600k subs (vs. 288k current).  Further, given the characteristics of the insurance business, much of the growth is self-funded and over-time the company should continue to see releases of working capital as the float grows.  

Model example 
Acquire customer from vet referral for $120 dollar upfront payment at a 20% contribution margin on a $45 monthly premium, which lasts 6.1 years (1/churn rate), implies a high 60’s IRR. 

Variable costs are claims expense of 70% of revs and client servicing (e.g. claims processing) of 10% of sales. Fixed expenses represent G&A and technology which should scale positively and stabilize at 5% of sales at efficient scale.  

Pros

Subscription based cost plus model 

Potential secular growth story leveraging “pet huminzation” trend here in the US on the back of a under penetrated industry 

Growth is self-funded by FFO & working capital releases 

Owner/Operator/Founder CEO with 5% ownership 

Net cash balance sheet position 

Cons 

Superficially expensive stock and heavily shorted as bears focus on relative valuation to mature accident & health companies 

Monthly churn of 1.5% implies a 16.6% annualized “melting ice cube” dimension to revenues that must consistently be replaced to keep subs flat.  

50% of stock is VC owned 

Highly competitive space with much deeper pocketed competitors, including Prim Watsa from Fairfax financial  

Thinly capitalized relative to competitors 

Model extremely sensitive to customer acquisition costs & claims expense trends

Why compared to GEICO?  

Well they contend that they are structured to spend 70% of premiums on claims vs. peers that model 50% and still earn attractive returns on capital given unique operating, distribution, and financial model.  Over-time, this should create a better product in the consumer’s eyes reinforcing member growth trends and further leveraging the fixed cost base driving scale advantage.  

At 580k pets in 2021 (15% CAGR), the company should do $40-$45 million in EBIT while employing just ~$90 million of  invested capital representing capitalized acquisition costs of $120-$160/pet sub X 580,000 subs, which is increasingly financed by float.  

I know stocks like FAST were always expensive but still delivered low 20’s IRRs as they were able to deploy all FCF at high rates of return so I am trying to crack this nut by applying same approach.  

Any thoughts appreciated

** Update**
 
I believe it comes down to the company being able to deploy all FCF into new subs at historic ""normalized"" rates of return, which appear to be 25%-35%.  This implies IV growth of 25%-35% for a long time if 100% of FCFs are reinvested.  Under this approach, the stock could be cheap.  ",6,0.7,1469401271.0

I read this article and trying to understand how earnings yield provides a margin of safety...

Graham says that the margin of safety can be obtained by comparing stock earning yield to aaa corporate bond rates.
So he says basically as long as the yield is say twice the bond rate the margin of safety lies in that difference between the rates.

It doesn't make sense to me because the stock price doesn't always follow earnings.
Earnings can change but the stock price might not reflect the change. So it is possible that earnings can go up but the stock price can go down.
So say that earnings continue to increase but the stock price stays the same or even continues to go lower....

What does it matter that earnings are higher than bond rates? On the bond rates at least you are getting the actual cash as compared to earnings where the shares earn more but the share price may not reflect that.

t3_4viy2s,"my first, very crude, DCF(FCF) analysis of S&P 500 constituents, & the results","* ive been reading fwallstreet/oldschoolvalue/margin of safety in recent weeks and have developed an interest in Warren b's long term investing philosophy 

* I'm lucky enough to have access to a Bloomberg terminal at work

* i downloaded Free Cash Flow data for all SP500 constituents, along with their 'fully diluted market caps'

* I projected forward next 20 years the FCF for all ~500 businesses, using a very crude assumption that FCF will flat-line at the average of the preceding three years.

* Discounted cash flows at 9%, summed them all up and took this to be my own interpretation of the business' value

* Compared my calculated valuation versus current market cap, and noted down how many multiples higher the actual market cap is (i.e. how overpriced it is, relative to my very crude measure)

I figured this would give me an approximate sliding scale for rating SP500 businesses from 'hugely over priced' to 'hugely under priced'.

Without pasting the full set of results, my data indicated:
- oil/energy related companies were, perhaps unsurprisingly, rated as hugely overpriced. Phillips 66, Chesapeake Energy, Southwestern Energy, Ryder System, all big offenders in this regards
https://s31.postimg.org/ff2wczkcp/worstvalue.png

- four (non-financial) good cash generating businesses that seemed under priced to me:
Delta Air Lines Inc
LyondellBasell Industries NV
CenturyLink Inc
Ford Motor Co
https://s31.postimg.org/nw2enwp1l/value.png

I recognise my approach was incredibly simplistic, but wanted to possibly get a little conversation going about e.g.
(i) the virtues of DCF on FCF (for big businesses, a la SP500)
(ii) the validity of flat-lining future cash flows (because I'm not convinced this is a particularly less ridiculous attempt at predicting the future without crystal ball)
(iii) the four businesses that seem potentially under priced.

I was able to get my hands on one of those books. I started reading, but after a few pages, you'd realize that you don't understand these books because you have no accounting knowledge, no knowledge of macro economics etc etc....


The only solution to these problem is there should be a structure to learning about investing instead of having multiple random books thrown at you.


For example in math class, the structure is:

1. Introduction to algebra

2. Intermediate algebra

3. Calculus 1

4. Calculus 2 etc 

The idea is that you can't jump to calculus 1 without knowing algebra

I think there should be a clear structure when it comes to learning investing as well. e.g

1. Learn accounting principles


2. Learn micro and macro economics  etc.

The company, Ekadharma International / EKAD (sounds pretty dull to me), is a leading manufacturer of duct tape and other adhesive tapes in Indonesia. A quick google search confirmed no analytical news regarding the company's stock.

Looking at the basic data, I found a P/E of 6. Due to recent good news from Brexit and tax amnesty program, the majority of Indonesian stocks went up 10-20%, including EKAD (before the spike, the P/E was 4.8-5).

Obviously, P/E alone cannot justify a stock's performance. I browsed the 2015 annual report, and the balance sheet looked very solid. Debt is very low, cash reserve has been increasing, and cash reserve + short-term marketable securities - *total* liabilities (debts are around 2/3 of total liabilities) roughly equals to zero. I'm no duct tape expert, so I can't accurately estimate the rest of the asset's liquidation value, but I guess it should not deviate too far from the book value since duct tape materials and machines are pretty standard stuffs to sell (I guess?). Receivables and inventory are stable.

The story gets better. I first found the stock through a screener that looked for low P/E relative to earnings growth. While many companies trading at low P/E have stagnant growth or obscure identity (you just can't believe the standards we have over here), EKAD had a 13% EPS growth for the last 5 years. And looking from Q1 2016's report, they're killing it on the earnings. 

So, definitely not going bankrupt soon, good product, good future growth. Am I missing anything? Guys, have I found my Pep Boys?

TL;DR: unfollowed stock, established brand, low P/E and good growth, good balance sheet. Buy?",3,0.64,1470931018.0

They also have the highest deposit balance/account and the best new employer metrics (acct maintenance costs, investment options, reputation, ect). I'm going off memory but I believer I'm safe saying <15% of US adults have an HSA account. HSA + HDHP seems to be the future of US health insurance. Thus, I believe the 15%-20% industry growth projections over the next 5 years is reasonable.

HSA Bank has a $50m NI run rate at present (seems to have higher margins than HQY or WAGE). HQY trades at 87x P/E. WAGE trades at 96x. If we value HSA Bank at 65x then you get a $20b asset bank for free. Simple as that.

A spin-off of HSA Bank would almost certainly be value accretive at the current valuation (goodwill is $21m). WBS would need to sell some loans & securities to do so but I think the investment will work out well with or without a spin-off.

t3_4xxaa5,HELP! Analyzing commodity movements with trucking manufacturer WNC to guess gross marign going forward,"So I'm looking into a semitruck trailer manufacturer WNC and took hot roiled coil steel pricing and correlated it against material cost/new trailers delivered to see if I can surmise an impact here.  Just to start things off, the CFO had this to say about their material costs on the most recent conference call...

> <Q - Mike J. Baudendistel>: Thanks and good morning. I just want to ask you a question on the gross margin
percentage on the quarter, which I guess was a record. When I look at your Q, it looks like a lot of that was in the
commercial trailer segment related to material costs being down or at least not keeping us with price. Could you just
talk a little bit about, is there any sort of timing issue there with respect to material costs and how much of that is due to
commodity cost being down versus material taken out of trailers or any other issues there?

><A - Richard J. Giromini>: Yes, you get a little bit of both, we have done some component design optimization that
has benefited us in that regard. So there has been material cost that's been taken out from there. But on the raw
commodity side, we certainly have had some benefit from raw commodity environment. Just for some recollection for
everyone, on the aluminum and the hot rolled steel side of the business, we go out and take forward positions to – and
we price our product according to what the projections are for cost and then we actually go out and take forward
positions when we secure a firm order from customers.
So we mitigate any of the upside or downside that is associated with those commodities. So we don't see an impact
when it comes to aluminum and to hot rolled steel or the material that goes into rear frames and the bracketry systems
and all for landing gear.> 

Since I view this answer as the most difficult thing to interpret in the entire world (har har har) and there is no discussion about futures or forward contracts in the 10-Q [I went ahead and pulled the data that you can see here](http://imgur.com/a/m71D8), and it appears there is a significant correlation with steel pricing lagged over 4 quarters. At first I thought, great! With steel prices having fallen until this past quarter we should be in for more consistent margin growth.

Here's the thing though: this company typically turns inventory 10x/year. That says to me that this company is likely purchasing material to turn 2-3x/quarter, and that what I'm seeing should be a spurious correlation. Further, you'll notice in the unlagged chart [here](http://imgur.com/a/LBG1U) that there has clearly been a deviation in cost and steel prices this year. My guess is that they got really lucky on hedging earlier this year, but I can't determine anything here further as they don't discuss it in their 10-Q, and I'm trying to predict the gross margin in the quarters to come.

Any help coming to a conclusion here would be much appreciated.

On the surcharge side, do operators have pricing power on setting the rate and negotiate a rate for merchant rebate - which is just surcharge COGS? 

2) What's the average duration for contract? Is it correct to value contracts more than the number of ATM machines? In other words, is it possible for an operator who has more machines than the contracted machines? 

3) The market is going through a secular decline, but companies in this space generally have the ability to generate stable cash flows. Under what adverse circumstances would an ATM operator become distressed? 

4) It's common for those ATM operators to explore M&A opportunities in this cheap debt environment. Assuming a company is buying another, is it just like buying a portfolio of ATMs or is it more like buying more desirable market coverage (contracts)?

t3_4zuoti,Benson Grahamathon and the wild story of Non-recurring losses,"I have a couple of questions that I've accumulated in my readings over the past few days:

- In Security Analysis Chapter 32, Graham talks a lot about the choice between charging certain extraordinary charges to income or to ""surplus."" When he says ""surplus"" is he referring to retained earnings? Like, is it possible to just directly lower retained earnings on the balance sheet without ever touching the income statement? I don't understand what this phrasing means.

- Also, Graham talks a lot about making adjustments to different companies' income statements so that their accounting methods will be made comparable. For example, he compares the statements of US Rubber and Goodyear for the years 1925-1927, and he shows three different methods of comparable accounting, depending on how you account for inventory loss reserves and actual inventory losses. My question is: It seems like if you were a professional investor who was keeping an eye on a set of companies over the course of several years, you would have to not only decide which method of accounting you were going to hold them to, but then also remember (or just make detailed notes in an excel spreadsheet) which method you were using from year to year. After many years of doing this, you would end up with your own ""adjusted"" financial statements that would look very much different from the actual financial statements that are filed by the companies. And I imagine that this would get really confusing. I guess I'm just asking how people deal with this. If I'm looking at a set of three companies in a particular industry in 2016, do I just arbitrarily go back five years to 2011, decide which accounting methods I'm going to use, and then make adjustments starting in 2011 to each company's statements until I'm all the way forward to 2016 and then I can compare? But shouldn't I actually start with the statements from the very inception of the company, so that I'm not starting in 2011 with a bunch of differently methodized statements? I obviously don't know shit about accounting, but the whole idea of this really messes with my head. 

- A question now from the book *Expectations Investing* by Michael Mauboussin. First off, I'm only 25 pages into this book but it seems like the basic idea of the book is to do a DCF model for a stock, but instead of making a series of assumptions to arrive at a calculation of ""intrinsic value,"" you use the current stock price as the market's estimation of intrinsic value and then just backsolve to see what the market expects in terms of cash flows and sales growth and shit. This is basically just algebraically rearranging an equation, not anything particularly crazy, but Mauboussin makes it seem like this is some super innovative new method for investing. I don't know. I'm only 25 pages in like I said. 

Anyway, on page 11 he says 

> Earnings do not recognize the cash outflows for investments in future growth, such as increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets.

Isn't this wrong? Earnings does account for increases in accounts receivable. Like, once you've recognized revenue, you see a corresponding increase in accounts receivable. Am I crazy?

- On the next page, he says

> Multibillion-dollar restructuring charges create ""cookie jar"" reserves that companies can use to fuel future, illusory earnings.

How does this work? I have no idea what this means

- Last question is from a passage on page 20:

> The discounted cash-flow model also dominates pricing in the commercial real estate market. When the Empire State Building went up for sale in the early 1990s, real estate experts pegged its market value at around $450M - and yet the purchase price was a scant $40M because of the building's long-term, below market rate master lease. Neither its marquee name nor its prime location set the Empire State Building's price. Its discounted cash flow value did.

Is this just saying that the owners of the ESB were locked in to where they could only charge really low values of rent for its tenants? Like, aren't most leases only 1 year long? Couldn't they just increase rent by 10x the next year?

t3_4zy823,Thoughts on Alibaba,"Recently, I have analyzed my position in [Alibaba Group](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/baba/quote.html) and there are some serious red flags I believe aren't necessarily reflected in the share price. This comes after the stock's recent run up, following the best year-over-year revenue growth rate [year-over-year revenue growth rate](http://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p160811.pdf) since its IPO. 

**Auditing**
For starters, many are skeptical as to who actually audits the company. The Hong Kong member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers signs off on each 20-F, but [some](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/can-we-trust-alibabas-numbers-auditor-has-never-faced-us-regulatory-scrutiny-2015-09-15) suspect that the audit is mostly done by the mainland member firm of PwC, Zhong Tian LLP. This suspicion is warranted; why would the HK member firm spend a substantial amount of time auditing in Hangzhou (Alibaba HQ) when there is already a [PwC office in Hangzhou?](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Price+Water+House+Coopers/@30.2738586,120.1593303,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x344c9d80d4b3464f:0xa1c2a0377ac5980b!8m2!3d30.273854!4d120.161519?) This would require PwCHK to send auditors to Hangzhou. If PwCHK isn't actually the principal auditor, then it is in violation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's  (PCAOB) auditing standards, [section 543](https://pcaobus.org//Standards/Auditing/Pages/AU543.aspx). However, the PCAOB is largely ignored in China; the board is forbidden from inspecting the Chinese firms and their U.S. listed audits (mainland or Hong Kong). As long as that continues, there is no telling whether PwCHK was actually the principal auditor. 

Moreover, why is the HK member firm engaged in Alibaba's audits in the first place? Nearly all of Alibaba's revenues and facilities are located in Hangzhou. Barron's supposes that a HK audit sign off is used to soothe investors' concerns over the 2012 SEC administrative proceedings against the mainland affiliates of the big four accounting firms. Though the case was settled in early 2015, there's a risk that if a few firms become non-compliant with documentation requests, the administrative proceedings could restart. Consequently, *if our independent registered public accounting firm, or the affiliate of our independent registered public accounting firm, were denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC, we would need to consider alternate support arrangements for the audit of our operations in China*. Remember, the proceedings were leveled against mainland firms, so surely the *affiliate* is a reference to Zhong. Furthermore, *if our auditor, or an affiliate of that firm, were unable to address issues related to the production of documents, and we were unable to timely find another independent registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to delisting of our ADSs from the New York Stock Exchange or deregistration from the SEC, or both. This would materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs and substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our ADSs in the United States. (FY2016 20-F;pp.49)* The auditing structure--much like the variable interest entities and Alipay ownership structure--is quite suspect.

**SEC Investigation**
More pressing is the recent SEC investigation that was revealed to investors in Alibaba's latest 20-F. It reported this:
*Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, informed us that it was initiating an
investigation into whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC has requested
that we voluntarily provide it with documents and information relating to, among other things: our consolidation
policies and practices (including our accounting for Cainiao Network as an equity method investee), our policies
and practices applicable to related party transactions in general, and our reporting of operating data from Singles
Day. We are voluntarily disclosing this SEC request for information and cooperating with the SEC and, through
our legal counsel, have been providing the SEC with requested documents and information.*
If the SEC forces Alibaba to consolidate its Cainiao operations, it could decrease net income by roughly RMB156 million. Though this will hardly effect non-GAAP net income of RMB29 billion, you have to wonder what related party transactions pertain to. Perhaps the abstract contracts with Alipay? In addition, any measures discrediting Singles' Days GMV count will adversely impact share price.

**Lawsuit**
In May 2015 Alibaba was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York by Kering S.A and other plaintiffs, concerning sales of counterfeit goods on Alibaba marketplaces. Thus far, Alibaba has been rather reactive, rather than proactive on protecting brands' intellectual property rights. Instead of actively targeting counterfeits, they merely react to voiced complaints customers and third party sellers. They have their own targeting system for these fakes, but I rarely hear impressive reports detailing crackdowns. I've only seen PR boosters from [WSJ op-eds](http://www.wsj.com/articles/counterfeit-goods-have-no-place-on-alibaba-1466635312) and the [company itself](http://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p151221.pdf). This aloofness will not help their case.

**Systemic Risk**
Also, there's been a lot of talk about an imminent collapse of China's economy. Notable forecasters include legendary short seller Jim Chanos, who has raised concerns about the debt/capital ratio of the country (300% of GDP), the real estate bubble, and the rapid decline in real GDP. George Soros claims China's credit growth will lead to a bigger crash than 2008. Stanley Druckenmiller stated that further stimulus provided the PRC central bank can't drive growth in the economy, which is already awash in credit. 
I always avoid blindly following the financial celebrities, but the given facts are hard to disregard. These are clear markers of an economy on the precipice of ruin. Surely this will hold back consumer spending habits and the rapid rise of the urban middle class, a projection essential to Alibaba's growth outlook. 

**Overwhelming Bullishness**
Lastly, investment experience has taught me that the market can move against the prevailing sentiment, especially when revealing facts are not incorporated into the general thesis. According to [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=BABA.N), about 90% of the analysts covering Alibaba have a buy or outperform rating on the stock. Sure, some of these analysts review Alibaba on a daily basis, and the latest quarterly report was promising. However, I'd expect at least a dozen analysts to recommend holding the stock considering all of these red flags. Maybe the market isn't being so efficient here. 

I bought into Alibaba when it was undervalued at roughly $70 a share. I quick look at the growth rates and a cheap reverse DCF calculation on [GuruFocus](http://www.gurufocus.com/dcf/BABA) gave me confidence that a margin of safety existed (Yes, in a Chinese Internet company!). But now all things considered, including an adjusted P/E of roughly 65 (excludes interest and investment income, which constitute nearly 65% of net income), the intrinsic value is hardly worth over $100. Amid all the strikes against the company, it'll take some real willpower to hold until it reaches the median PT of $110. 

As a risk averse investor, it seems like I should bow out of this play rather soon.

Any thoughts are welcome.

t3_50nmax,Investing in Biotech Pharma (Discussion),"I've studied biotech/pharma for the past 15 years or so and concluded that it's not a good industry for investment, but that it could be under priced at times and thus a good short term investment.

Here are my thoughts and I'm open to hearing others thoughts as well.

1.   Due to pharma/biotech/healthcare's necessity to life (people need some drugs to live), they should be treated like utilities (able to make a profit, but not an outsized one) or lottery tickets (small companies that can develop a drug that cures cancer should go from $2-$200.

2.  These companies do not operate in a capitalist arena.  They are given subsidies, importation laws and patents to stifle others from competing.

3.  As the Shkreli, Valeant, Mylan scandals have shown, the industry has a great political and governmental risk.

4.   Increasing sales of many drugs is a detriment to society.   Many of these drugs like Lipitor or  XYZ have side effects.  Trying to get more people to take them when they don't need them is bad for people (but usually leads to patients taking more drugs to combat the side effects).

5.  Even after a company has come out with a home run drug, they still could be sued 5-10-20 years later for side effects that weren't apparent when the drug was released.

So in summary, this is a tough industry.  So many issues and their product is so important to society.    Hopefully we see ethically sound companies operate in an honest manner and make a fair profit (another debate).",4,0.67,1472742237.0

t3_50sj8g,Quotes from Graham's 'The Intelligent Investor' on 'Bull' Markets,"I am currently collating notes from both 'The Intelligent Investor' and 'Security Analysis'. While doing so, I have decided to share with you the ones from 'The Intelligent Investor'* on 'Bull' markets, and would love you to share your opinions on current market levels.
All are actual quotes (with minimal editing).

*

Symptoms:

The faster its advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings, the riskier a proposition it becomes.

Bull markets had a number of well-defined characteristics in common, such as:
•	Historically high priced level
•	High price/earnings ratios
•	Low dividend yields as against bond yields
•	Much speculation on margin
•	Many offerings of new common-stock issues of poor quality.

In the middle of the bull market the first common-stock flotations make their appearance.

Corporations choose to offer new shares to the public when the stock market is near a peak.

As the market rise continues…the quality of the companies [in IPOs] becomes steadily poorer.
Sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies are offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for many medium-sized companies with a long market history.

For every dollar you make in this way you will be lucky if you end up by losing only two.

*

Crash:

The harder they go, the harder they fall.

Some of these issues may prove excellent buys – a few years later, when nobody wants them and they can be had at a small fraction of their true worth.

Many investors now view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of crashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market.

*

Consequences:

The Cost of Loss: Figure 20-1 (http://i.imgur.com/O4wCtdI.png)

As an old Turkish proverb says, “After you burn your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt.” 
Considering how calamitously wrong the “experts” were the last time they agreed on something, why on earth should the intelligent investor believe them now?

Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1900% just to get back to where you started.

t3_51395e,Value Investing with Bruce Greenwald,"A few questions I've accumulated from the book Value Investing by Bruce Greenwald:

1) He says 

> Most value investors are specialists in either particular industries or certain special circumstances, such as bankruptcy workouts.

Is this true? I think of value investors as mostly generalists, but maybe I'm just thinking of the older guys like Buffett, Schloss, Klarman.

2) Here's another quote, in a section of the book where he's disparaging DCF valuation models:

> The present value approach in practice relies on information - parametric values for operating variables - that is often not knowable, especially in the distant future.

What does he mean by ""parametric values for operating variables""?

3) When making adjustments to the assets on the balance sheet in order to determine the ""reproduction value"" of the assets (i.e. what it would cost a competitor to come in and compete), he likes to try to take into account ""the cost of reproducing the engineering knowledge, images, dealer network, and organizational experience of the corporation"", and he typically uses three years of R&D costs to estimate this. I have many questions about this:

- Why wouldn't the company just poach employees from an already existing company instead of ""building up engineering knowledge""?

- Why use R&D expenses instead of SG&A?

- Why three years? Why not more or less?

- Wouldn't it take a real industry insider in order to determine these values? How would a generalist even know how much this stuff would cost to replicate?

3) Quote:

> We estimate that the cash most businesses need to run their operations amounts to about 1 percent of sales

Why? Also, in a low interest rate environment like today, wouldn't it make sense to keep some excess cash on the balance sheet, since the opportunity cost is less?

4) I'm not sure I really understand the concept of a ""LIFO reserve"". Any help on this?

5) I'm not sure I really understand the whole ""some companies earnings must be reinvested in the business in order to maintain market share, and can't be distributed to shareholders, so it's not real earnings."" 

Like, I understand that if a company must be constantly making maintenance capital expenditures for repairs on its factories and equipment, then these costs are capitalized and not expensed until later periods. But then in later years, these costs *are* expensed. So over the long run, not on a one year basis but on a decades-long basis, don't earnings always represent what can be distributed to shareholders?

t3_51dao1,"Useful criteria to screen for ""buy and hold"" type stocks","I've been going through a lot of old posts looking for gems, and I found this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4zzj16/alright_my_turn_post_your_stocks_and_get_a_full/). And within the comments, /u/dvdmovie1 lists his criteria. It seems like exactly how Buffett screens for his companies.

Here is his comment, copied and pasted:

""This is what I'm looking for. Again, I am not saying that this is ""the one way"" by any means. It's simply the things I am looking for when I am looking for potential long-term investments - and really, I buy with the intent to own for the long-term. I'm tired of all the trying to time this, that and the other. I'm not going to re-position and re-think for every Fed speech, I'm not going to try to endlessly tweak and stress over what I own and this is an attempt to find those longer-term names where I don't feel as if that's required.

1. Moat. I do not buy something if I don't feel the company has a moat/barriers to entry. That's really a huge thing to me, as I'm buying businesses that I want to own for 3-5 years and - hopefully - beyond. I do not want anything where I feel that someone else can do the same thing tomorrow. Whole Foods was a growth story and Whole Foods believed that no one else could do what they do. Well, no: everyone could do what they do and soon enough, they did. Whole Foods has admitted as such and now the growth story is over. They are scrambling to do this (open up smaller stores in an already overcrowded grocery market to emphasize their cheaper 365 product when they should have been doing that years ago in anticipation of the inevitable point where everyone would do the same thing), that (rewards program) and the other (be more promotional.)

2. Part of a durable theme. I try to identify what I believe are durable, long-term themes that I want to capitalize on. This can be as simple as a continued rise in pet ownership and spending money on pets. It may be something like the era of big data and associated infrastructure. It could be an acceleration away from B & M retail as more and more retailers face the reality that retail is overbuilt in this country and store counts are going to shrink. It could be something like more and more people growing their own fruits and vegetables and greater consumption of prepared/fresh as the freezer section declines. It may be alternatives to traditional sweeteners as people move away from sugar, yet still want sweetness in their drinks and foods. It could be many things. When I say durable, I mean....

3. ...not a fad. I do not want to have to babysit investments, I don't want to try and sit there and time the cooling of a trend and I definitely have no interest in trying to chase trendy investments. People can do very well with fads, but most people do not: the fad cools considerably and people don't exit it (see GPRO). I don't like apparel, I don't like fickle consumer plays - and the consumer is ultimately fickle. Michael Kors (KORS) was an incredibly hot stock until it wasn't. To quote ""Project Runway"", ""As you know in fashion, one day you're in. And the next day, you're out."" Have no interest in that. Also have no interest in...

4. ...drama. Especially stupid drama. Lululemon (LULU) has mostly done well for investors over the years. I'll question the moat, but beyond that, shit like promoting your clothing has seaweed in it and then it doesn't makes my eyes cross. I have no tolerance for inane bullshit like that.

5. Quality management. I want shareholder-friendly management that has consistently demonstrated a track record of shareholder returns. Look at some of the greats: look at John Malone's Liberty companies. Look at Danaher. Look at Bill Stiritz, formerly of Ralston Purina, now of Post Holdings. Berkshire. Markel. BAM. Middleby. Casey's.

6. Stable, consistent growth. I am looking for companies that hit the ball year in/year out. Fiserv is a fine example. Danaher. Visa. Ecolab.

7. Tangible assets. I do like to devote a good deal to tangible assets, including even things like land and water rights play Limoneira (LMNR), as well as a number of REITs and other companies (pipelines, infrastructure, etc.)

8. Needs. Does the company satisfy a need/address a problem? While not every investment is going to focus on ""needs"", a good deal of them do. Ecolab: giant hygiene and sanitation company: restaurants and grocery stores need to stay clean and follow food safety standards, hotels need to get rid of pests, etc.

9. Compelling valuation.

10. Dividend is a plus, most things I own pay a dividend, whether tiny or significant (or in-between.)

Bonus: I tend to like companies higher up the pyramid that deal with all of an industry rather than a specific player or just broader plays in general.

To offer an example of the kind of thing I'm talking about, rather than betting on a particular chain restaurant I'd rather bet on a Middleby (MIDD) that sells equipment to any restaurant and they are an enormous innovator for a lot of things that are behind-the-scenes at Starbucks, Subway, Chipotle, Chik-Fil-A, Dominos and elsewhere. Thermo Fisher is another one of these sorts of ""picks and shovels"" plays, only for science.

Additionally, for those who watch to watch a highly entertaining CEO speech, here's one from the Middleby CEO from a couple of years ago at the Baron Funds Conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL-jQwpZ5Ag
In terms of a broader play, I like Visa as a broad play on consumer spending where I'm getting something that will benefit with greater consumer spending, whether it be online or B & M, and I don't have to bet on a particular retailer that may or not may not have the right mix of products this quarter or may go through any number of other problems.) With Visa, the concerns are regulatory and to some degree technological advancement, it's not betting on a clothing retailer who didn't have a good quarter because they got stuck with too many Winter clothes during a warmer-than-expected Winter. Inane stuff like that starts to get into #4 above.

Lastly, I also like to focus on companies with considerable recurring revenue. Ecolab is heavily consumables that have to be reordered frequently.""

I am up for an interview with a diversified industrials team and am looking to create a financial model that will really blow the team away and show I can get into the details.

t3_51j713,Capitalizing R&D - Tax Benefit?,"Hi All,

I am working on building R&D capitalization into my DCF model and am confused on the tax benefit from this reclassification from operating to capital expense.

Specifically, does the tax benefit only last for the current year in which we are capitalizing the expense, or does this benefit last into our forecast period?

I was reviewing Damodaran's valuations for Tesla and noticed that he doesn't add the tax benefit to his FCF forecasts, so I am thinking that the tax benefit only exists for the current year and is an artifact of the reclassification, but won't be present in future years. (http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/03/return-to-firing-line-revisiting-tesla.html) Damodaran calculates the tax benefit (see ""R&D converter"" sheet), but then does not incorporate it into his model and does not add it to current year's NOPAT when calculating ROIC (cell B40, ""Valuation output"" sheet), so he's got me a little confused.

Pragmatically, my question is: when forecasting FCF, do we just need to adjust the pre-tax operating margin by the difference between the R&D Expense and R&D Amortization and multiply the resulting EBIT by (1-tax) to arrive at NOPAT, or do we need to add the tax benefit to this NOPAT figure to arrive at the correct estimated for our forecast of NOPAT?

Forecasted NOPAT:
1: (Unadjusted EBIT + R&D Exp - R&D Amort)*(1-tax)
or
2: (Unadjusted EBIT + R&D Exp - R&D Amort)*(1-tax)+tax benefit
where Tax Benefit = (R&D Exp - R&D Amort)* tax

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

t3_51wpm5,Thoughts on Valeant?,"**TL;DR: Valeant looks cheap, what am I missing out on for bear case?**
**Disclaimer: I do not have a extensive knowledge of Valeant, and I am horrendous at write-ups.**

I've tried to read up briefly on it, my understanding is that 
(1) Business risk is significantly lower vs say, 6 months ago when they had not released financials, had risk of breaching covenants, etc. (and of course the stock price has rose along as well)
(2) Probably biased, but it seems like Valeant has all hands on deck wrt to deleveraging, divestiture and business management. The management is working hard because they can't afford one more fk up.
(3) Multiples are depressed - probably pricing in all the concerns. 

Some guidance from Bill:
This excerpt that caught my eye from Pershing Square's 2Q16 letter at the bottom of page 11: https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/media/2016/08/26151702/PSH-Interim-Financial-Statements-06.30.16-Final_ii.pdf 
*""Management announced that it had identified non-core assets which represents a transaction value of USD8bn or 11x EV/EBITDA which are being evaluated for divestment.""*

Ackman's quote in an interview: http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/26/bill-ackman-we-made-one-very-big-mistake-with-valeant-and-lost-big-time.html
*""[Valeant] is now a more traditional Pershing Square investment"" now that it's been pummeled, he said. ""We normally invest when shareholders have lost confidence in management. And that's what happened here. It was not just management, shareholders lost confidence in the numbers. The financial statements were delayed. There was a potential default.""*

Regarding financials, I looked through some reports from Morgan Stanley. Their assumptions are more conservative than consensus and my very basic evaluation is that they will be able to deleverage significantly over next 1-2 years. I think this is a concise summary of the bear case put across here: http://www.smarteranalyst.com/2016/08/19/analyst-putting-valeant-pharmaceuticals-intl-inc-vrx-back-burner/

*Amsellem commented, “The amendment in and of itself does not render VRX investable, in our view. The shares are trading at 8.4x EV/2016 EBITDA (based on the low end of VRX’s guidance range of $4.8B-$4.95B issued in June), bearing in mind that we continue to believe that VRX’s implied expectations for a significant 2H16 recovery is overly optimistic. Further, we do not see how potential divestitures recently cited by VRX would put the shares on a stable footing, nor do we see a path to stable EBITDA beyond this year.”*

*“Suppose that VRX was to execute on the sale of assets totaling $8B in transaction value at 11x aggregate EBITDA (or near $730M), per management commentary on its 2Q16 call. That would take EBITDA down to $4.07B (based on the low-end of the guidance range provided in June), and would take total debt down to $22.8B (assuming all proceeds are indeed used for net pay down). The translates into a pro forma (PF) debt/EBITDA of 5.6x (still quite high), and an PF EV/EBITDA of 7.9x, not exactly attractive particularly considering that there could easily be more pressure on the business (such as the potential pressures on U.S. Neuro/Other that we cite above). Put another way, given these dynamics, why would the shares be rewarded for the execution on the potential divestitures that management recently cited?” Amsellem explained.*

Both bear and bull cases seems to be directly at loggerheads - how best to evaluate their claims then? On one hand I think the deleveraging warrants a more positive outlook and hence a re-rating, but the bear case seems to be equally adamant - ""Put another way, given these dynamics, why would the shares be rewarded for the execution on the potential divestitures that management recently cited?""

However, soon after he left, the company was hit by a variety of complaints about product quality on government contracts. This could be directly attributed to Singleton's single-minded focus on margins, which incentivised his managers to cut corners wherever they could. It tarnished his otherwise legendary legacy somewhat. (*Source: Distant Force: A Memoir of the Teledyne Corporation and the Man Who Created It*)

It's no secret that the thirst for margins has always stood on the opposite side of ""business quality"", and is one of the leading asymmetries between ""entrepreneurs"" and ""shareholders"". Obviously things aren't so black and white, but it's worth discussing.

The real culprits are far less sinister and are actually sincere in their motives, so you won’t see an Oliver Stone movie about the conspiracy to defraud the middle class and strip them of their hard-earned retirement savings. No, the “bad guys” in the story are just Nobel laureates, tenured professors, and other honorable members of the economic academic establishment, what Ken Rogoff calls the “policy community.” The Occupy Wall Street crowd had a right to be angry, but they should have been demonstrating in front of the economics schools at Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Yale, etc. You know, the schools that many of those Occupy Wall Street protesters themselves attend.

t3_53smgu,Credit Acceptance : A Structural Short,"http://seekingalpha.com/article/4007510-credit-acceptance-structural-short

I recommended shorting the shares of Credit Acceptance (CACC) at the beginning of this year (read here), arguing that the imbalances brewing up in new vehicle market will manifest into used vehicle market resulting in severe headwinds for the company.  The stock has lost 7% on an YTD basis, although it was down by more than 20% at one point this year (in June), with the post-Brexit rally helping to recover the majority of those losses. The time elapsed since my recommendation gave me the opportunity to take a deeper look at the company’s accounting policies, review its relationships with dealers, keep a close-eye on the trends unfolding in the industry and lastly engage in discussions with fellow investors to get a handle on the wide variety of opinions surrounding it.  Interestingly, it’s the narrowly held opinions in the marketplace that serve as the fertile ground for the collective wisdom of crowds to fail, putting odds in our favor. 
So what are the collective opinions about Credit Acceptance? 
a)	A differentiated business model that allows CACC to make loans that have higher returns and lower risk than its auto lending peers despite it targeting a weaker consumer segment (Sub/Deep Prime). 
b)	CACC is in the 2nd loss position as dealers hold the 1st loss position in this transaction, bestowing a big margin of safety to CACC. Hence, the justification for the premium valuation relative to its peers.
c)	CACC program allows dealers to make sales and profits which they wouldn’t have otherwise. 
d)	The spread, difference between forecasted collection rate and the advance rate has never gotten to zero since the company went public in 1992. 
e)	The company’s auto loans performed remarkably well during the great financial crisis of 2008, and if the capital markets didn’t freeze up, CACC would have captured a bigger market share. 
f)	Fears related to an auto loan bubble are over-blown. 
And, what were the questions that fueled my cynicism?
a)	Why should a dealer sign up with CACC’s program especially when they have plenty of auto-financing options available from Santander Consumer USA (SC), Nicholas Financial (NICK), Consumer Portfolio Services (CPSS), and Wells Fargo (WFC)? 
b)	How much an independent dealer can make in profits with the CACC program? More importantly, why CACC’s conventional program isn’t attractive enough for the franchised dealerships. 
c)	Why the company has only been able to retain 5K dealers despite enrolling more than 20K dealers to its program since 2006?
d)	Besides the atypical deal structure (Dealer- CACC side of equation), what’s the value proposition for the consumer- ability to finance, state & price of the vehicle, or the loan terms.
e)	Why is the company so reluctant to share any credit performance metrics with investors unlike all other players in this industry?  
Before we embark on our journey to find answers to aforementioned questions, let’s dig a little deeper to understand the economics of a loan:-
CACC advances a portion of the expected future cash flows to the auto dealer at origination (~ 44% of the Loan amount (Principal + Interest). Collections on the consumer loan are allocated first to Credit Acceptance to pay its 20% servicing fee. The dealer loan made by CACC is then repaid in full before any payments are made to the dealer (80% of collections after paying advance loan) with respect to the dealer holdback. In theory, the holdback amount cushions Credit Acceptance against the losses on the consumer loans since 80% of losses come out of the dealer holdback - a fact clearly visible in its annual filings before 2003. But in reality, CACC projects a forecasted collection rate (outlined in red- Table 2) to the gross amount of consumer contract (Principal + Interest) - given the credit profile of the borrower and employs this projection to determine the amount it is willing to advance to the dealer. This adjustment, however, changes the dealer holdback economics sharply.

Dealer Holdback ( before fees) 	$1,694 

A dealer's holdback changes from $5986 per contract (100 % collection) to $1694 / contract (before fees- forecasted collection rate). A 33% haircut to the gross installment contract turns into a 72% haircut in potential profit for the dealer.  On the other hand, servicing fee revenue for CACC drops from $ 3271 (20% x $16354 -100% collection) to $2198 (20 % x 67.20 % x $16354) ~ $1073 per contract. In other words, for each dollar CACC loses in its servicing revenue, a dealer loses $4 of holdback payments. That’s, unquestionably, one hell of a risk sharing agreement from CACC’s perspective but a sucker’s bet for a dealer. 

This demands serious introspection by investors as why would dealers agree to this model considering they are accepting a lower up-front cash payment, and hoping that after 2-3 years of sale they would begin to earn their back-end profit of $900 per car .  Kindly note, that until a dealer closes a loan pool (100 contracts), their holdback is withheld by the company.  To provide context, new active dealers have historically done 16 loans / year with CACC, while the average volume /dealer has hovered near 37 loans per year. Clearly a lot of wait time for the dealers before they see their holdback payments. 

I believe, the way and context in which dealers receive information from CACC profoundly influences their decision to enroll with CACC’s program. First, CACC's uniquely structured deal is the only such program in the lending industry, thus absent any comparable program- dealers rely heavily on the first piece of information offered to them- which in this case is the potential of fat-checks at the back-end. 

CACC’s management asserts their program allows the dealers to generate incremental sales that otherwise would be unavailable to them since their program guarantees 100% approval.  And to substantiate this claim, I reached out to few dealers but was taken aback by a comment made by one particular dealer –it allows them to sell end of life cars that otherwise would be scrapped.

Management notes that 70 % of the company’s dealer partners are independents, and their program allows independents to compete with the established franchise dealerships. Interestingly, the management acknowledged on the recent Q2-FY16 earnings call (link here) the challenges it faces in order to penetrating larger franchise dealer segment. An astute reader, at this point, may ask if a program isn't economical for franchise dealers with fast inventory turnovers than how is it economical for independents.  I’d note that industry wide gross margins for used vehicles have been in an unrelenting decline after a short lived uptick in 09, as shown below. 

 


It seems, to offset the punishment of lower margins, independent dealers are left with no choice but to inflate the price of the car until it escapes the ‘monthly affordable payment' a customer's psychological barrier.  Or, they are forced to buy inventory at the very back end of the black book- suggesting stretched loan to value ratios. 

CACC’s nearest competitor America’s Car-mart (CRMT) has historically paid nearly 80% of CACC’s advance amount ($5825 versus $6886 for CACC) to acquire their inventory. This spread, however, began to invert starting Q1-FY15 and fast forward to Q3-CY16 CACC’s advance amount ($5620 / unit) now sits at 80 % of what CRMT ($6925/ unit) is currently paying to acquire their used cars. Gross margin headwinds surrounding CRMT for the last 7-8 quarters are very well known to investor community. CACC’s loan term is almost 2 x. longer than CRMT’s (53.2 months vs. 30 months). The belief that declining advance amount reflects mitigation of risk on CACC’s part; these beliefs are myopic and fail to comprehend industry dynamics.  If the current industry dynamics continue, CACC’s dealers will be forced into difficult decisions to force back-end inventory on their consumers or demand advance amount materially above today’s rates –driving CACC spread lower. 

 


The overarching question is how it translates into CACC's financials. And this is where it gets trickier because the management shuns any conversation regarding loss rates, deficiency loss or the true charge-offs. Rather, it steers investors towards the consistency exhibited by the forecasted collection rates it discloses to construct a coherent story for the coherence-seeking investor mind, who more or less follow a list of boxes that must be checked before making an investment decision. During my conversations with longs, I made a disconcerting observation that investors indeed assign a heavy weight to the forecasted collection rates, sometimes to the point they are disregarding subsequent information plainly because peeling it away is rather discomforting.  


Forecasted Collections and Losses

2015 forecasted percentage at the end of Q2-FY16 was 67.0 %, a 40 bps decline q/q, or 186 bps decline y/y, the biggest decline for any vintage in 22 quarters. Additionally, I’d note that 2015 vintage had 23.2% of collection realized compared to 28.7%/26.5%/26.2%/25.8%/25.6% for 2010/2011/2012/2013/2014/2015, lowest collection among the vintages issues after 2010.  2016 vintage even though had a very little seasoning to them so far, had 5.0% of collection realized , compared to 6.2% / 6.3% / 5.9% / 6.0% / 5.6%  for 2011/2012/2013/2014/2015 vintages.  

 

The question arises how these collections transpire into the finance charges? Finance charges according to the company’s 10-K comprise of 1) servicing fees earned as a result of servicing consumer loans assigned to them, which generally equals 20 % of collections, 2) finance charge income from purchased loans, 3) fees earned from third party ancillary product offerings, 4) monthly program fees of $599 charged to dealer dealers under the portfolio program; and 5) fees associated with certain loans; 

And, we can reasonably estimate the cash collections realized by the company during any given year using two methods:-
a)	Principal Collected for Dealer Loan  plus accretion  ( From Note 5 in 10K’s)
b)	Cash collected for each year vintage using credit metrics the company provides (See Appendix-Table 1), and we arrive at same numbers using method a) as well. 

I demonstrate in the table below, that finance charges generated from its portfolio (20% of cash collected) and purchased program (cash collections –principal collected) only make-up two-thirds of its total revenue while the monthly program fees ($599 / month) & the fees earned from 3rd party ancillary product offerings account for the remaining 30 % of the revenues (excluding 5% fees with-held from holdbacks).

Average yield (finance charges / average net loans receivable balance) on CACC's portfolio program is meaningfully lower than reported – 16.8% versus 25.8% widely reported and purchased program yield stands at 18.7% for FY15.

After adjusting the fees (~5%) the company nets out from the holdback payments, I note a shortfall of 480 bps between the reported yields and the estimated.

One wonders “Why would CACC leave that amount on the table by not netting out this amount from the advance at the time of contract assignment to mitigate its risk?”  Evidently, netting this amount upfront from the dealer advance renders the transaction completely uneconomical for the dealers.   The excess amount booked as revenue (~ $136 m for FY15, ∆ Yields x Avg. Rec. Balance) appears to originate from the cash that CACC withholds from the dealers who haven’t closed a loan pool, and treats the cash collected from consumer repayments as its own. It is worth noting that only 50 percent of dealers are able to close a loan pool with the company. I emailed the company’s investor relations the following question 

“During our last conversation, you stated almost fifty percent of your dealers are able to close the pool. Does CACC retain all the back-end money on the loans from dealers who haven't closed a pool yet?""  

After some back and forth emails, I received a reply that confirms this transaction.

Me: “Got it, so less than 50 percent of dealers close a pool and those who don't their hold-back is retained by the Credit Acceptance”.
IR: ""Yep.""  

The aforementioned answer is consistent with my belief that the amount withheld is indeed booked as finance income charge on the income statement, but the associated liabilities of paying out to the dealer once aren’t recognized anywhere on its balance sheet. A counter-argument could be made that contractual obligations of holdbacks are contingent upon the receipt of consumer payments and the repayment of the advance, thus allowing CACC to retain this amount.  The notion that a company can use consumer payments collected on behalf of its dealers, yet somehow withhold the excess amount and use that substantial amount in ways that have not been explained to its investors is astonishing.  

The table below shows my estimate of what CACC could be liable for holdbacks in the next four years ~ $1.0 billion.  This sort of financial engineering not only helps in overstating top line revenue but also helps in masking the real net debt the company owes.  Adjustments to offset financial engineering profits, results in a leverage ratio of 10.2 x versus 7.6 x ( Debt / EBITDA) or  3.0 x versus 2.2 x ( Debt / Equity), suggest the investors , lenders are completely misjudging CACC's true value, health, and risk.

 

Charge-offs absorbed 

Another investor favorite metric to strengthen their argument is lower charge-offs compared to its peers.  Investors, I’d argue are failing to consider alternative explanations that help in uncovering the real charge-offs experienced by the business. And, to bring some light on the true credit metrics of the business, let’s go down the memory lane to refresh ourselves on CACC, as well its accounting policies.

Since going public in 1992, the company listed dealer holdbacks, net as a liability on its balance sheet, and maintained a reserve of advance losses which were charged off or partially charged off when the company's analysis determined the expected discounted cash flows associated with the related loans were insufficient to recover the outstanding balance in the pool. Just to put it in perspective, the company charged off nearly $760 million against the dealer holdbacks from 1999 to 2003. An estimated 80% of charge-offs were absorbed by the dealer-holdback this way (In discussion with management, they affirmed holdbacks continue to absorb nearly 80 % of losses). 

But effective July 1, 2003, the company retroactively eliminated the reserve for advance losses balance, which was previously classified within dealer holdbacks, net and transferred the balance into the allowance for credit losses which is classified within Loans receivable, net. Readers should note that following these modifications, the company ran into issues with their previous auditor Deloitte, purely on the auditor's assertion that the company should account for its loans as a servicer of loans in conjunction with being a lender to those dealers.  SEC in June 2005, informed the company's method of accounting should change to ‘servicer of loans' and ‘a lender to those dealers,' rather an originator of consumer loans. The company changed its accounting which allows for finance charges to be recognized based upon forecasted cash flows not based on the life of the underlying asset. Subsequently, the company inserted the policy of not writing off loans once there is no forecasted future flows on any of the associated consumer loans, which occurs 120 months after the last consumer assignment.  

The company’s liquidity and capital resources explanation in their annual filings changed radically from 2011 onwards to ‘We need capital to maintain and grow our businesses from ‘We need capital to fund new Loans and pay Dealer Holdback”.

Management’s assertion that holdbacks continue to absorb nearly 80% of losses suggests from 2006 to 2015 approximately $4.4 billion of losses (cumulative holdback payments: $888.6 million divided by 20%) had been charged-off this way. 

 

Despite having a charge-off policy remarkably different from its competitors such as Nicholas Financial (NICK), Car-mart (CRMT) (120 months vs. 9-10 months), CACC's charge-off to liquidation or charge off as a percentage of average net loans receivable is nearly  6 x worse than its peer NICK.

Finally, let’s debunk the fallacy of limited losses that the company faced during the 2008’s financial crisis. Considering the primary risk to CACC emanates from the loss of servicing fees on contractually delinquent accounts, estimating its effective servicing fees (20 % x Forecasted Collection Rate) is fairly simple.  We can notice in the table below the effective servicing fee for CACC since 2006, as well as the credit loss provisions.

	53%	59%	64%	46%	72%	94%	89%	84%	89%	119%

From 2011 to 2015, the credit loss provisions (derived) were more or less in line with the reported financials, but I note servicing fee loss only made up 55 % of loss provisions from 2006 to 2009. Seemingly, these provisions reflect the losses for certain vintages which extended beyond the losses absorbed by the holdbacks. And these losses, in my view, would have suffered meaningfully absent ‘cash for clunkers’ program announced during the depth of financial crisis to give a life line to ailing auto-industry. 


Sustainability of dealer growth

Management points to 55k dealers as their TAM, but the real number is probably closer to 40-50% of the stated TAM, reflecting the nonprime & subprime market.  The company has grown its active dealer base by 4x since 2006, and management suggests it can double the dealer-base 1-2 x to present its case for more than enough runway ahead of it.  Investors meanwhile failed even to ask the reasons for massive attrition witnessed from 2007 to 2015.  CACC, effectively saw an attrition rate of ~65% after signing up nearly 15K dealer partners since 2007, out of which only 5k turned into active dealers. I remain puzzled by why; a company given such a long runway behind it is still unable to stop mighty dealer- attrition.

For Q2-16, active dealers were down 4 % q/q, the first decline in eight quarters, and the management attributed this decline to an increasingly competitive environment during the Q&A session on the conference call.  Dealer attrition of 17.2% was highest in the last five years while the volume per dealer continued to decline in 1H16, down by 2% y/y in Q2-16.  The most important revelation during the conference call was the penetration headwinds the company faces with their traditional (portfolio) loan program.   (Link for Earnings Call Transcript).

It shouldn’t strike surprising to anyone that large dealers aren’t finding CACC’s traditional program attractive enough now that we know that it isn't as profitable as initially narrated.  CACC , it seems exists solely to hollow out the capital from the dealers by forcing an abusive transaction on them  and exorbitant interest rates from the consumers. 

The last argument left in bulls quiver rests on the management's track record in capital allocation considering CACC has bought back nearly 50 % of their stock since 2001. If, CACC stopped growing its balance sheet, would the business actually generate free cash?  I believe the company now finds itself in a vicious cycle where it can only re-purchase shares marginally by raising more debt as demonstrated in the cash flow projection below. Really, what is the point of CACC growing if, after all of this time, it still can-not generate cash?  CACC has been free cash flow positive only once in the last ten years.

Under normal circumstances, one would expect a company which shares an awful lot of similarities in charge-offs, loan losses with its industry peers to trade at industry average but CACC continues to trade at 13 x ttm earnings multiple.  I believe this gap mainly exists due to investors assigning too much weight to information provided to them by management, and not paying due attention to accounting shenanigans.

(2) listing quarterly fundamentals of an individual publicly-traded company going back 5 or 10 years?  Where?  

Hey folks.  I've read some of the classic books on value investing (I will admit I have not made it through *all* of Graham's *Security Analysis*) and have been lurking here for a while.  I enjoy the process of searching for and analyzing stocks, but I can't seem to find the tools that will help me do this work as efficiently as I would like.  

My goal: based on analysis done *myself* in Excel, *not using others' tools*, I want to (1) screen vast numbers of stocks and then (2) analyze individual stocks based on fundamentals.

**(1) Screening based on fundamentals**: I've seen some really good free screening sources -- finviz.com, Google Finance, thinkorswim, etc.  But I'd really like some more customizability: I'm envisioning being able to plug in a minimum and/or maximum for certain fundamentals, setting ""scores"" for other fundamentals, etc., and being able to tweak these formulae/requirements at the drop of a hat.  This task is perfectly suited to my Excel skills.  But I can't seem to find a source for the (relatively current) raw data in a usable format (CSV or similar).  And I'd like not to have to build a scraper myself (assuming the data is even there in a format consistent across companies and thus hypothetically scrapeable format, which probably it is in 10-Qs and 10-Ks themselves), since my programming skills are, um, a little rusty for that.  Obviously, the more publicly traded companies on which I can get this data in one go, the better.

(To be clear, I am hoping *not* to have to export data from an online stock screener *after* having already done some screening--I'd like to be able to play around with all the data myself.  That said, perhaps I will have to settle for this.  I see that in thinkorswim, I can export a slice of current fundamentals data on a pretty large number of companies all at once.)

**(2) Analysis of an individual equity's (historical and present) fundamentals**: Having done an initial screening, I want to look back at an individual company's fundamentals as reported in 10-Ks and 10-Qs going back some time (say, 5 or 10 years) to be able to chart and analyze the data in a highly customizable manner (seeing a pattern?).  Again, if possible I would like not (a) to have to read through 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other filings to do manual data entry, nor (b) to have to build a scraper.  So, same data as (1), but instead of a single time-slice across many companies, a single company-slice across time, so to speak.

Unsurprisingly the UK doesn't have many cheap shares on offer at the moment. My pick of the bunch however:

* ARGO LN Equity/Argo Group Ltd (Although share price rallied 50%+ recently so I'd be reluctant to jump on a running train)

* NTQ LN Equity/Enteq Upstream (Which I will be bidding for at 15.50 - just a handful of shares to put some money where my mouth is, and because I'm encouraged at the sight of one of the current large shareholders).

Australia is dominated by exploratory miners, but a couple of names that prompted a little more interest from me were:

* VELCP AU Equity/www.vealls.com.au: few liabilities, lots of cash-based assets, albeit market cap already higher than I would like to see.

* SRS AU Equity/www.spicers.com.au: A long running paper merchant trading in deep value territory. They made a very costly and failed expansion attempt in to Europe and Canada in last few years. I think management are committed to turning this around... but lots of liabilities and possible pension/legal challenges overhanging from their EU/CAD retreat.

* SBB AU Equity/www.sunbridge.com.au: looks very strong on balance sheet. Sells sunglasses, tonnes of cash assets, few liabilities, but it has strong Chinese links and I wouldn't trust this stock with an investment. Website is crap too. No sir.

Canada, similar to Australia in terms of focus on basic material businesses. Some highlights included:

* SEC CN Equity/www.senvest.com; some sort of investment/holding firm, too big and complex for me to really understand what was going on. Looked interesting on balance sheet.

* NFD/A CN Equity/www.northfieldcapital.com; Very few liabilities, considerable assets including cash. As above, its value is derived from its holdings of other businesses. I don't feel comfortable in this ""holdings"" space though.

Japan... lots of eligible stocks. But where english is not the first language for a businesses' website/marketing material etc, seems like a space for gamblers to me.

* 4840 JP Equity/www.triis.co.jp; strong balance sheet, relatively few liabilities and a cash balance that nearly equals market cap.

* 3770 JP Equity/www.zappallas.com. None functioning website. Good balance sheet (to my untrained eye anyway)... lots of cash, few liabilities. They seem to operate in the digital space i.e. are not fixed asset heavy.

t3_55o3ow,What is your favorite method of capital allocation?,"I have been thinking about this a lot recently, possibly because it is one of my favorite topics in business. 

What is your favorite method for a management team to allocate capital. Put differently, what is your favorite method of cash being returned to shareholders? 

I think they are all pretty subjective to the particular business situation, but I have some general thoughts on each. 

**Capital Expenditures**: This is the yardstick that all forms of capital allocation should be measured against. Capex is great because it does two things: 1) improve the general quality of a businesses core operations, and 2) allow a business to expand into new territory. Through the income generated we can calculate the return on capital for capital expenditures - especially if you can break the biz down to unit economics and say ""this is what a new store costs, and this is how much profit you get in year 1, 2, and 3"" - boom, instant credibility for why you spent the money. However, as economic laws tell us, the bigger a business gets and the more profit it generates it becomes harder and harder to sustain a high return on capital. In my opinion, if a business cannot earn a high enough return on capital in excess of its cost of capital it should not spend capital on capex, but rather one of the other methods below. 

**Dividends**: Useless in my opinion. I know many people like this, and I understand why, but if I think of capital allocation as a way to maximize my company's returns on capital I just don't see any value created from dividends. I understand that it increases *my* return on capital as a shareholder, but I would rather capital go towards improving the business in some form. People often critique buybacks as what businesses do when they run out of ideas, I would suggest that its really dividends that fit that summary. 

**Buybacks**: On that topic, I view buybacks as a double edged sword. Buybacks can be a businesses best friend, especially in the hands of an activist. Lets look at both sides. On one hand, buybacks are great if the business is undervalued, especially if management thinks the business is so undervalued that they can earn a higher return on capital buy repurchasing shares as opposed to other methods of capital distribution. This is a net positive for everyone. On the businesses side, they earn a high return on capital through buying undervalued shares, and as a shareholder my slice of the pie increases - even more so with aggressive buyback plans. On the other hand, buybacks can be a great way to simply light money on fire. Here are some ways that I have seen this happen 1) the business is overvalued and the share price declines heavily after a large buyback program, 2) the business fundamentals are deteriorating and the buyback plan is just enough to meet EPS targets when net income is falling, and 3) large issuances of stock options and other dilutive securities would increase the number of shares outstanding, so buybacks are put in place to ""even out"" the effect and keep shares outstanding normalized. 

**Debt Repayment**: I really like this method of capital allocation. Repaying debt does two things: 1) it de-leverages the balance sheet, and 2) it reduces your interest expense payments which boosts net income. The net effect if an increasing ROIC numerator and denominator that stays the same (if I have $110 gross capital and $10 cash, my net invested capital is $100. If I buyback $10 of debt with cash then my gross capital is $100 and with $0 cash my net capital is still $100)  - thus increasing ROIC. This is also a good way to get creditors off your back if you're getting close to a stressed capital structure, and when done aggressively, can be a very positive change for businesses. A lot of times I see this with businesses that re-IPOd after having been owned by PE for a number of years. A lot of times investors can get frustrated with this method because it takes a while to shed the LBO debt before other forms of capital allocation can take place. 

**M&A**: Not quite tied with dividends for how useless this is, but a close second. I only say that because this method is not as cut and dry as the effect of buybacks or debt repayment, or even capex, on returns on capital because the success/failure of M&A is tied to the execution ability of the management team and whether or not ""synergies"" are actually attainable. PCP, for example, was a business that executed M&A very well and actually implemented internal ROIC targets for the operations of the new biz that needed to be achieved. In cases like this, value can be created. But for every successful M&A operation there are probably a dozen or so more that fail to deliver any value-add and probably destroy value if anything.

Hello. I’m having a hard time understanding how Ackman built his position in CMG and why his transactions weren’t shown on the 13D like Icahns. I understand he used OTC forward contracts and small equity and sold Puts. How come none of the expiration date is shown? Is it because of the 60-day time period?

The MSFT takeover is for $196/share, and has already been approved in the US, but LNKD is currently trading at $190/share. So assuming it closes in Dec as anticipated that's a 3% return, or ~12% annualized.  

As I see it, worst case scenario is Salesforce buys TWTR **and** the MSFT deal falls through. Though the odds of both those occurring is pretty low I would imagine. Maybe ~5%? And if it happens, not like LNKD is worthless (though not a stock I'd really want to hold). So let's say it drops ~$40/share. Assuming that, pretty positive expected value...

So whats the margin of safety here?
The fact that you can lose 50% of the stock price and still come out equal to the bond return?
Second of all 10 years is a long time. Bond yields and stock yields change fast.  How can you assume that nothing will change in 10 years?

t3_581xiy,Is my calculation of intrinsic value correct?,"Assume Company A has no risk, i.e. all assumptions under this forecast are accurate. 

Company A’s current year profits are $35m, forecasted real growth is 12%, and it will be sold at 8x PE in 20 years. 

At year 20, Company A’s profits should be $338m. So the selling price should be $2,700m. Debt:Equity at year 20 is expected to be 1:3, so the realizable value should be $1,800m.

Company A’s cumulative real profits can be calculated with the [future value of annuity formula](https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&rlz=1C1QJDB_enMY677MY677&q=future+value+of+annuity+formula&oq=future+value+of+annuity+formula&gs_l=serp.3..0l6j0i22i30k1l4.3289.5795.0.5982.10.8.0.0.0.0.422.1093.3-2j1.3.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.3.1090...0i7i30k1j0i67k1.fcu_a8ilV64), giving us a net present value of $2,522m. It has a dividend payout ratio of 33%, and retains all remaining profits for growth/debt service. Hence, cumulative real dividends should equal 1/3 of $2,522m, or $840m.

Therefore, net present value of FCF should be cumulative dividends + realizable value, i.e. $840m + $1,800m = $2,640m.

t3_58fvp5,Games Workshop,"This is my first public post of a security analysis, looking for advice on metrics and technique.

Games Workshop creates Warhammer figurines. Some moat is derived from their lore (story line) which is a fantasy story and locks in customers to the game. They seem to me to be a simple company to analyse: all profit for the last six years has been paid out to investors in the form of a dividend.

http://imgur.com/a/lOUL8 numbers £'000

Net profit since 2010 has been steady bar for 2014 [1]. Since 2006, £7.3m capital has been deployed, initially coming from a small amount of debt which over these 10 years has seen profit rise from £2m to £13.5m giving a ROIIC of 158%. However there is a clear lack of opportunity for the company as these funds haven't been reinvested for six years.

If the company continues to payout 100% of net income and maintains its seven year average income (£13.016m) then the current price (market cap: £178.411m) offers a return of 7.3% in perpetuity.

The company implies in their 2016 report that they ought to spend a bit of cash on capital projects:

>To be around forever we also need to invest in both long term
capital and short term maintenance projects every year, pay our staff what they have earned for the value they contribute and deliver
surplus cash to our shareholders 

however it seems the latter of this statement is of more concern to them. At the start of 2015 they changed CEO from Tom Kirby (also 6.7% shareholder) to Kevin Rountree. It doesn't take extensive googling to see what people [thought of Tom](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Tom_Kirby) compared with the much more [fan appeasing Kevin](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Kevin_Rountree). Happy customers make a happy company, perhaps Kevin will attempt to expand the business, and if successful could provide very high returns on invested capital as the business has in the past.

Downside seems fairly unlikely, although [this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/4jsrxx/is_games_workshop_really_that_expensive_for_what/d39pzor) implies that there is competition, and it wouldn't be difficult for another business to come up with their own lore to compete with the iconic Warhammer brand. In the meantime, a 7.3% yield is pretty decent, and if Kevin does his job according to their strategy, then returns could be considerably higher yet.

Thanks for reading and I will take on board any advice and proper adjustments you have to offer.

* NetApp

* McDonalds, what's to stop another fast food chain from offering something better? Healthier food seems to be a trend now also, which could significantly reduce their business.
* Disney, what's to stop a company like Pixar from replacing them?
* Wal-Mart, what's to stop Amazon from replacing them the way Netflix replaced Block Buster?
* BestBuy, same, the stock went down because sales were going more online, somehow they have a durable competitive advantage? I don't really see how it is different from Netflix vs Block Buster.

The paper basically said that there would be an economic collapse in the early-to-mid 21st Century caused by increasing resource extraction cost.

The commentary in these subs become the ""new"" analysis that is compelling because some of these people come up with legit stats at times way better than what we see from disney's media. 

Thus, disney's espn just becomes another cbs where people go to watch sports instead of the addictive ""analysis"" that we use to love. They still have programs like PTI and around the horn that i think people love, but regardless there is less appeal rest assured esp the flagship sportscenter since scores and analysis like i said earlier is obtained from the simple yet complicated internet.

t3_5cizkv,Common Investing themes emerging from Donald Trump's Historic Presidential Election,"Although the market's behavior post Trump's win in the historic  presidential election clearly appears to be the discounting future growth which now president elect advocated during the campaign. And, that to me now is turning into more of a 'groupthink' behavior, which often becomes becomes a fertile ground to harvest for contrarian opportunities. 

But before we begin to discuss the potential areas of opportunities - here's my take on market action prior to and post elections. 

a) Market's began to price in a Trump victory from early October - losing 80 S&P500 points (-3.7%) , wherein price action on the night of election was more more of knee-jerk reaction (group-think). It didn't took investment community long to realize his pro-growth stance thus the sharp reversal , followed by the rise in yields. 

B) Nasdaq or tech sector as we refer it , on the other hand, has been on some what intriguing path since Oct. From Oct until pre-election day it lost 270 points (-5.5%) , and has lost 3 % after rallying from the lows made on Tuesday ( election) night.

And, all of a sudden common narrative appears to be changing as well. Money managers now are commenting Trump as good for America,(not to mention their vested interests in Fannie Mae) and suddenly everyone is sifting through infrastructure proxies, real estate plays , and demand side proxies to ride this wave. 
 
And this is where I am  skeptical. Was this the catalyst this boring or the most hated market needed to catapult into an euphoric phase ? Until so far everyone has been calling this market a bubble , and I had been taking opposite side of the argument - disputing if bubble is the common narrative than it couldn't be the bubble. And now when everyone is beginning to price in growth - it makes sense to sift for names which become the most disconnected from the pure fundamentals. 

And, this leads me to question the themes that are emerging beyond the obvious choices such as Cyclical / Infrastructure Spend / Defense . How about names sensitive to consumers at the low end of the disposable income spectrum , may be in retail . 

Would appreciate people chiming in at this forum to discuss common investing themes

t3_5cnfyy,Stock Dividend vs Cash Dividend,"I was reading an article that says that often stock dividends are preferable over cash dividends since if stock dividends don't have the cash option you don't pay dividend income tax on them. 

Lets assume a company is so big that it can't grow anymore...
Hypothetically, the company gives you an option to choose stock dividend or cash dividend.

With a cash dividend the company pays out cash which you can use to purchase more stock. But hypothetically the company will now have less cash so that can effect future earnings. My guess is that the future earning loss after the dividend distribution will be offset by the fact that you own more shares after reinvesting the dividend. So nothing really changes as far as future return.

With a stock dividend, the company doesn't lose any money and if it doesn't have a cash option, you don't pay any dividend income tax. So nothing really changes either.

So then it appears the 2 dividends are the same in theory, except that you save on taxes with stock dividends. 

However in reality if a company grows way too large, with a stock dividend all the earnings are retained and might not increase future earnings so the retained money can possibly be wasted on inefficient projects etc....So in a case like this, I would assume a cash dividend is better because that distribution is money that you can use to purchase additional shares and it wouldn't matter that a company didn't increase its earning since even if earnings stay flat you still got more shares due to the cash dividend reinvested.

So then a stock dividend has no purpose. If the purpose of a cash dividend is to provide periodic income as cash, then a stock dividend doesn't provide anything. I know that I can sell the new shares and make my own cash dividend but I could have done the same before the stock dividend was issued. ",2,0.6,1478997464.0

Today I came across [this Motley Fool article](http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/11/23/1-way-qualcomm-inc-is-leaving-intel-corporation-in.aspx), and I started to write a post in response defending my beloved Intel. But after looking at some more data online I'm not so sure. The article claims Intel is under threat from Qualcomm's accelerated development cycle in mobile chips, compared to Intel's recently decelerated cycle of 3 years. I take issue with this stance primarily because since at least 2014, Intel doesn't seem to be competing in that market segment anymore. Instead they've slowly shifted resources to their data center group, which has seen its share of Intel's revenues grow 10% over the past five years. Data centers are definitely a market Intel can be and is competitive in, with 99% of the market share according to [these guys](http://marketrealist.com/2016/04/will-competition-affect-intels-dominance-data-center-market/).

But wait, that last article revealed some things to me I had somehow missed. IBM and Qualcomm are breaking into the data center market as well, and now [even Nvidia is getting into the game](http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/08/15/what-led-to-the-surge-in-nvidias-data-center-revenues-in-q216/#2f0c1b515120)? This doesn't look as bright as I'd hoped for.

I'm still going to hang onto Intel for now. IBM and Qualcomm are just appearing on this battlefield and it'll be some time yet before either of them can make a significant dent in Intel's market share if we're strictly talking about processors, chipsets, and motherboards. Nvidia getting into the game is a great big looming cloud on the horizon, though. I've long suspected that Nvidia has the potential to shove Intel out of the processor market the way they've shoved AMD out of the GPU market if they devoted the appropriate resources to it, and it looks like those guns are coming to bearing. 

Anything can happen in the future, and unfortunately for me it looks like a lot of hopes and expectations have already been priced into NVDA's stock, making it too ""expensive"" for me as an investor.

t3_5epnxp,How best to track my performance against an index?,"Hi folks.  Seeking some help.  

It's widely accepted that the best way to track performance of any investing strategy is to compare the results to an index-- for example, the S&P 500 or Russell 2000.  Okay, but how?  I invest in a taxable account with Robinhood.  I add nontrivial amounts of money to this account (varying amounts) every single month, sometimes multiple times a month.  Consequently, my total gains look substantially smaller than they actually are.  

To get a genuine comparison of my performance with a given index over a given period, I can't just look at the overall price change in an ETF--I'd want to simulate buying more of the relevant index fund ETF (SPY, VOO, VTI, etc.) every time I add money to my account.  So far I have been simulating this with an Excel spreadsheet, but it's a real PITA to account for the continual deposits, dividends that I would be receiving from the index funds, etc.

t3_5er6r6,What kind of multiples/valuations do you see the Canadian Marijuana LPs getting if recreational is made legal?,"So most of us can price out the approximate gross revenues of the recreational market; from there, pricing out where the LPs/growers will be valued is a further equation of net margins/market shares/capex/etc (standard valuation metrics). Now, for the two scenarios I see playing out for the Canadian Marijuana Industry, one lends itself to higher multiples while the other leads to lower multiples.  
  
I see lower valuations/multiples coming from a loosely regulated market. With bulk retail sales you will just buy strain X from a jar and pay whatever the price it is; i see no differentiation of brand in this scenario and since all of these companies have the potential to grow all the same strains, commoditization of price should occur. In this scenario the low-cost producers benefit the most, and then the industry valuations will be lower because margins will be squeezed and net margins will end up at lower levels; less net revenue/commodity pricing leads to lower multiples, less differentiation of product.  
  
But, I do believe the most probable scenario with higher valuations/multiples will come from a highly regulated climate, with prepackaged goods and regulated pricing; this will relieve some downward pressure on pricing that would come from commodity pricing of bulk goods. If prepackaged goods are mandatory as well, then branding will play a large part in retail sales. Branding means people will pick your product over competitors, so you have better pricing power and market share (better pricing power = better margins, higher market share = higher revenue). In this case, I see potential for companies capturing higher market shares (due to branding) and I see higher net margins due to more pricing power; due to these factors, I see higher potential valuations/multiples.  
  
Not to mention the probable higher multiples due to being an eternal, defensive industry (a lot of famous investors talk about the best investments being the ones you can forget about for 100 years, ill argue Marijuana being one of the more eternal industries). Lower CAPEX required to run the business (Which means margin protection). With the industry being brand new, ill argue that 20 years of recreational sales being the norm will be a huge factor in eliminating negative stigmas associated with marijuana; this should increase consumption and gross revenues. Highly regulated climate also means potential barriers of entry for LPs and could mean all sales going through very few establishments (provincially owned), so you know your brand will be in every store.  
  
Im rambling, but does anyone else see how a highly regulated marijuana retail climate could lead to potentially high multiples/valuations when it comes to the LPs/Growers? Occam's Razor dictates that we see a highly regulated climate with provincially controlled stores and prepackaged products; I see this being the perfect storm for LPs to capture higher market shares/net margins. From a security analysis standpoint, I see plenty of catalysts for higher valuations/net multiples; also see plenty of margin of safety as well (even if they only do medicinal sales).

I have been following chicken stocks off-and-on for roughly 2 years waiting for the cycle to turn, and I think we're closing in on real inflexion.

* Nov 17 - leak of the ""[Schronce memo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/11/SchronceMemo.pdf)"" (read the WashPo article above).  The literal human calculator that compiles the GA Dock price says that it's highly suspect, and ""I do not think I am getting actual weighted average prices from some companies.""

* The Georgia Dept of Ag put in a [new rule](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-poultry-fa490d4e-b630-11e6-939c-91749443c5e5-20161129-story.html) (effective this Monday, Nov 28) requiring GA Dock price submitters to formally acknowledge the transactional validity of submitted prices, and to submit evidence of such if requested to do so.

* Funny enough, Georgia Dept of Ag is now [unable to publish a price for this week](https://google.com/#q=www.wsj.com/articles/chicken-price-report-halted-amid-scrutiny-1480528304) due to lack of participation (out of 11 possible submitters).  TSN and PPC have said that they still submitted prices.

* This is critical because the GA Dock price is what is used in many contracts, e.g. grocery stores.  In the most recent conference call, SAFM said that they were mostly profitable due to their retail segment.  If the allegations about GA Dock being 50% over-priced are true, this will kick profitability right in the balls.

* PPC says that GA Dock only affects a small amount of their business.  This is at odds with what has been the case traditionally (and is general knowledge in the industry).  The lawsuit cites testimony:

    > ""internal Pilgrim's documents show that virtually all chicken products, even if their not sold spot, are tied to the spot prices... 83% of Pilgrim's chicken sales are reflecting the spot price within a given year  So there's only about 16% of their sales that are not tied to the spot market over a relatively short period of time.""  Further, because half of ""fixed contracts"" actually had terms tied to Broiler spot market prices, Dr. Carter concluded that 92% of Pilgrim’s Broiler sales were tied to Broiler spot market prices such as Georgia Dock..""

t3_5gc9tp,Bebe Stores (BEBE) Writeup,"Full version + historical financials / metrics is uploaded here: http://docdro.id/vtGXVum

Short version is below for anyone that doesn't want to read more than two pages

**Bebe Stores (NASDAQ:BEBE) Writeup (11/30/2016)**

I am long shares of BEBE at $0.53 per share. At this price, BEBE has a market capitalization of $42.7mn. With no debt and $47.3mn of cash on the balance sheet, BEBE has an enterprise value of negative $4.6mn. Bebe is trading at 0.4x tangible book value of $121.2mn. I think this is an attractive entry point with high margin of safety for an ""iconic"" brand that should generate more than $300mn of revenue this year. 

**Introduction** 

Bebe Stores (""Bebe"" or the ""Company"") is a mall-based and online retailer of ""unique, sophisticated, and timelessly sexy"" contemporary women's apparel and accessories (e.g. separates, tops, dresses, active wear, handbags, and shoes). The average Bebe customer is 32 year old (ranges from low 20s to high 40s) and is college-educated, working, single, and has no children. The Company currently operates 182 retail stores, including 143 retail stores and 38 outlet stores, and has 82 international licensees operating stores in 23 countries. Bebe was founded in 1976 by Manny Mashouf (CEO and Chairman of the Board) and is headquartered in Brisbane, CA. 

From its founding in 1976 until the 2008-2009 recession, Bebe was a fast-growing and profitable specialty retailer. Since then, it has been a turnaround story with lots of C-suite turnover (four different CEOs). The stock is down 90%+ over the last 5/10 years. After a tough 2009-2010, Bebe saw solid performance in 2011-2012. Then a lot of damage was done when Manny stepped down as CEO and hired Steve Birkhold to run the Company in early 2013. Under Steve's leadership, Bebe made a number of questionable operational choices that confused and/or alienated the core Bebe customer, such as messing with product pricing, investing in marketing campaigns that overemphasized the party lifestyle (e.g. Bebe is for young 20-year old party girls that live a ""9pm to 5pm"" lifestyle), and organizing store layouts by color palette not by type. 

The substantial decline in share price was enough to get activist fund Prentice Capital Management (5.47% current ownership) involved in March 2016. Prentice filed a 13D and sent three letters to the Company's Board There was a long period of silence until Prentice filed a 13G six months later the day after the Company reported Q1 2017 results), which superseded its 13D filing. What happened in those six months / what did Prentice learn / did they just give up? Lloyd Miller filed a 13G with 5.46% ownership on the previous day.

**Thesis #1: Valuation is attractive** 

Bebe is an ""iconic"" brand, and the Company generated $384.5mn of revenue in the last 12 months and should generate more than $300mn this year. With a market capitalization of $42.7mn and $47.3mn of cash, Bebe has an enterprise value of negative $4.6mn. The Company is trading at 0.4x tangible book value of $121.2mn; even if tangible book value was cut in half, Bebe would still trade under 1.0x. The market is essentially saying Bebe is not worth the cash, let alone the assets at cost, on its balance sheet, which I think I don't think is the case. 

Why does this opportunity exist? Performance has been terrible, and the market is not assigning any turnaround value to the founder coming back as CEO or the JV transaction with Bluestar Alliance. There are also not many natural shareholders of Bebe. It's microcap stock with a share price under $1, is not part of any major indices (dropped from the Russell 2000 and 3000 in June 2016), no longer pays a dividend, no longer has any major sell-side coverage, and stopped doing earnings calls / hasn't presented at industry investor conference in a long time.

What is Bebe worth? That's hard to say, but I am betting it's >0. In my base case, I value Bebe at $1.40 per share (150% upside), which includes $0.59 for cash, $0.37 for real estate at cost, and $0.44 for the Bluestar JV (Bluestar paid $35.1mn for just under 50% ownership, which implies the enterprise value of the JV is $70.2mn). Adding $0.56 for closing the gap between current market capitalization and tangible book value and $0.08 for the NOLs using a 50% discount rate ($169.2mn of federal NOLs are unlikely to be used in the foreseeable future, but they are worth something / long-term upside), you get a share price of $2.04 (almost 300% upside). If the Company completely turns it around, that's an even greater multiple of where we are today. 

**Thesis #2: Manny is back (again) and is taking action to finally turnaround Bebe** 

In February 2016, Manny returned as CEO for the third time, and the Company has historically performed well under his leadership as CEO. He currently owns 58.14% of the stock, which has decreased in value from over $1bn prior to the downturn to ~$25mn currently. Manny is now 78 years old; he can't run the Company forever. 

In June 2015, Manny filed to sell his shares in a secondary offering at $2.47 per share (the registration statement was withdrawn two months later after the stock had decreased another 45%). Manny won’t be able to unload his position at the current price; he probably doesn’t want to sell now either. Unless performance drastically improves and a secondary is possible again, I think Bebe is ultimately taken private. While Manny has rebuffed recent acquirer interest, I think he is a seller (he was at $2.47), but wants to show a performance bump first. 

While profitability and cash flow have suffered over the last four years, the Company is now focused on rightsizing the cost structure and store base, not growing sales. Per the Q1 2017 10Q: ""Our strategic focus for the remainder of fiscal 2017 is to close unprofitable stores or negotiate rent reductions for stores with kickout rights or where the store lease is up for renewal. In addition, we continue to limit the size of the investment in inventory and capital expenditures."" Bebe cut over 80 heads and closed 21 stores in FY 2016 and plans to close up to 24 stores in FY 2017 (no plans to open any new stores this year). The Company is negotiating lease renewals on 35 stores in FY 2017, so there is potential to cleanly roll off underperforming stores if they are unable to negotiate rent reductions. Management is projecting a flat cash balance in FY 2017 vs. prior year.

**Thesis #3: International wholesale upside** 

In Q4 of FY 2016, Bebe entered into a joint venture with Bluestar Alliance to develop wholesale domestic and international licensing business. Bebe contributed its IP assets for 50.0000000001% ownership in the JV, and Bluestar contributed $35.1mn of cash ($35mn of which was paid to Bebe) in exchange for the remaining ownership in the JV. That values the JV at $70.2mn, which is well above the Company's market capitalization, so there is a lot of upside here. The purpose of the JV is to develop a wholesale domestic and international licensing business for the Bebe brand. Bluestar will manage the day to day operations of the JV. Bebe retained a royalty-free, perpetual license to use the Bebe IP in the US and Canada (i.e. to continue its existing retail store and e-commerce businesses). Bluestar is a brand management specializing in purchasing consumer brand companies and converting target operations onto brand licensing entities. It acquires successful as well as distressed companies. Since its inception in 2006, Bluestar has acquired select brands with current retail sales exceeding $1.5bn. Its current portfolio of brands manages over 200 licensees who distribute product globally. 

**Downside** 

The main downside is the obvious one: The turnaround doesn't materialize and Bebe continues burning cash.

**Catalysts** 

1. Quarterly improvement in same store sales and profitability (Q1 2017 was good) 
2. Capital structure improvement, such as finding a bank to provide a revolving credit facility, doing a sale-leaseback of the distribution center and/or design studio, or selling the two condos in LA 
3. Strategic alternatives (Manny is getting old, there are a lot of willing buyers) 
4. Cash starts to flow in from the wholesale licensing JV with Bluestar as new licensees are added 
5. CFO with solid retail experience is hired

t3_5gc2m3,Spotting a worth investing fixed income security : Where to start?,"Hello ! 
This is my first post on Reddit and my native language is not English, be chill with the spelling mistakes please :) Here we go : 

I have two weeks to produce :""[...]a recommendation to make a value investment likely to produce an annualized return of at least 12% in anything other than a listed equity (or equity fund) without activism. Examples include buying a specific fixed income security; buying a specific real asset such as land, a building, a commodity, or a metal; buying or effectively shorting a currency, buying a listed equity and agitating for specific change at the company, or
selling a listed equity short and publicizing research.""

This is really broad and there are some other conditions (we can discuss this later) but my concern is that I do not know where to begin... For instance, I read financial press and one thing leading to another, I have discovered that copper which is highly available currently might be under production deficit (Demand >> Supply) by 2019 -2020. How about buying copper now and wait for the prices to increase later ? 

But how do I know if the return will be 12%? This question can actually be applied to so many possible opportunities, you cannot predict the future that well and I am only a student with two weeks in front of me, not an expert analyst. 

I hope my point is clear: Where should I start in order to not loose my time (and sanity) in too many directions? I am ready to put a lot of effort in this task (this is my final paper for this lecture) just so you know.

In making the determination to release the valuation allowance against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, the Company took into consideration its movement into a cumulative income position for the most recent three-year period, including pro forma adjustments for acquired entities, its eight out of nine consecutive quarters of pre-tax operating income, and forecasts of future earnings for its U.S. business.

The word is Herald. Omaha World-Herald, one of a group of 63 midwest newspaper companies purchased off of Media General. Berkshire paid $142 million cash and loaned Media General (the part of the company that was left, that wasn't acquired by BRK) ~450 million at 10.5% interest. Just two years earlier Buffett told his shareholders: “for most newspapers in the United States, we would not buy them at any price” because “they have the possibility of going to just unending losses” and he didn't ""see anything on the horizon that causes that erosion to end."" The investment got scrutinized at the time, and a lot of people took it as an old man making a sentimental purchase. What we didn't know was that he also got the right to buy 5 million shares in the remaining Media General company for a penny each. Media General today is worth about $20 per share, up from $4 back in 2011. Meaning the warrants alone are worth a little under $100 million (and more than that at times). In addition, the debt loaned to Media General has been paid back, and Berkshire collected interest of 10.5% for years on that loan. Media General also paid another $44m to Berkshire as a condition of a later merger. Another example of profiting off of having liquidity when others do not.

Barron's interview with Shawn Driscoll of T. Rowe Price New Era fund (ticker: PRNEX)

http://www.barrons.com/articles/get-ready-for-the-great-oil-bust-of-2017-1482232313


Q: So we’re going to see a lot more supply?

A: There is a wave coming. It has already started. U.S. oil production bottomed in September, in our view. We think U.S. fracking recovery rates are still just 10%.

Q: How long will this bear market go on?

A: Ten to 15 years.

Q: Ouch. You’ve been a very good prognosticator on prices. Where do you see them going in the next year?

A: The sugar rush is going to continue in 2017, but only for a short time. The International Energy Agency made the case that we were undersupplied for ‘17, but we’re not. We have a million barrels a day over [demand], and the missing piece in everyone’s model is how quickly and how big the U.S. comes back, and I still think that is being massively underestimated. My guess is we peak out some time in the first quarter and then by the time we exit 2017 we’re back in the soup—sub-$50-a-barrel oil—and then at some time in ‘18 we dip below $40 a barrel.


Q: That is a very contrarian view.

A: The OPEC agreement theoretically goes to late May. What do they do if we’re right? What do they do if the U.S. is up 500,000 barrels a day by mid ‘17?

Q: Coming on during this cutback?

A: Yes, and once they see it coming, do they cut again? I bet no. These cycles are all about productivity and **the direction of the cost curve**. Historically, it’s hard to make money when the cost curve is flattening and falling, and we think that’s true for most of the commodity complex.

I find his definition interesting but haven't found how to calculate it yet. He believes, at least it's my understanding that he believes, the least it should equal is 2% of Single-Family Mortgage assets (approximately $60 B).

Assuming warrants are canceled and senior preferred shares are wiped, Fannie Mae could produce a $20 share price assuming a $100b market cap. for the company. The historical average PE Ratio for Fannie Mae has been 10. The company produced $11b of earnings in 2015. Some could legitimately argue that those earnings were inflated by $3b based on suspended dividend payments to the preferreds.

t3_5kiklh,[Discussion] Reliq Health Technologies (CVE:RHT),"**Outline:**
RHT is working on an app which connects healthcare professionals and patients, along with the patient's circle of care (i.e. family, friends, anybody able to assist in outpatient care). Their aim is to provide automated monitoring of patients through proximity sensors and wearable biometric devices, and to facilitate communication within the circle of care.

**Pros**

+ There are three already established pilots (Florida, LA, UK), and one white-label contract (to the estimated value of $1.2M; San Antonio, TX) commencing February 2017.

+ The company's and NHS' (UK) aims with regard to treatment are highly aligned, accordingly the NHS has expressed considerable interest in RHT.

+ Progressions towards mHealth (mobile health) incentivized by significant reduction in cost to healthcare systems through ease of administration.

+ Patient outcomes improved through more efficient health monitoring, further reduces costs by mitigating such fines as those imposed by e.g. Medicaid for preventable readmissions. 

+ In future RHT will establish Big Data services, providing another source of revenue.

**Cons**

- Liabilities of ~$1.3M, at present the biggest obstacle for RHT appears to be the accrued debt. Their cash runway is projected to last until Q1-2017, at which point the revenue from the aforementioned contract in TX will be their lifeline, unless they also acquire further financing from other sources.

- Currently not profitable, projection for profitability is in 2017. 

- Some degree of trust to overcome with some patients' expressed worry over cybersecurity.


I presently have no shares in RHT, however wanted to post about it here in order to discuss and clarify the viability of the company. If anybody has any further pros or cons to add from DD I've missed, let me know and I'll update the list.",2,0.63,1482824276.0

with the market reaching ATH after ATH mostly through multiple expansion, it gets harder and harder to find great investments that can produce returns of 8-10% ++. That`s why I would like to start a thread about your best Investment ideas at the moment. 

Here is the most attractively priced Company on my watchlist atm:
United Internet. You might not know this company as it´s a german mid cap but I'm from germany and am fairly familiar with it. They provide E-mail and other internet services and also sell DSL Internet to consumers and businesses.
They also did a JV with Warburg Pincus recently to do larger M&A Deals ( recently Strato). Uniteds founder and CEO Ralph Dommermuth owns about 40% of the company and he is thinking long term. Because of his long term ownership Exec and director comp is fair and not too high. The valuation is pretty cheap at around 15x forward FCF if you take into account that this is a fast growing (around 10%) company with low Capex requirements and very high returns on invested capital. Debt is modest, especially with euro interest rates ( thanks mario ). Their recent stock investments in Rocket Internet and Telecolumbus haven`t done very well but they are about 200m each ( 1€ per share) and could turn around, but even If they do not , this company is still very cheap. I think United Internet is a high growing, high ROIC company trading at a very attractive valuation. I think returns of more than 8% are easily doable and US investors also have the super strong $ to take advantage of. Definitly worth further research.

That was my best Idea atm, I looking forward to hear yours! :)",10,0.86,1484153821.0

As I understand it, a book of receivables is a fixed-income asset consisting of principal and interest payments from customers who bought goods or services on credit. How can that asset be debt or equity funded?

The company eventually ended up laying the ground work for some early internet infrastructure (or something to that affect,) and Buffett made a killing on the bonds.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about? What year was this and what was the company? Doing a google search on Buffett and ""internet bond"" or any other similar search query produce some off topic results.

t3_5odd7b,Calculating Enterprise Value on a business that heavily utilizes Joint Ventures,"Hi all,

Trying to wrap my head around the correct way to get to EV for Adeptus Health (ADPT).  Appreciate the insight of anyone with a deeper understanding or experience with this.

Here's my current formula (millions), numbers rounded: 

Market cap: 233.7
(+) Debt: 160.4
(+) Noncontrolling interest: 85.1
(+) Preferred stock: 21.9
(-) Cash: 28
(-) Equity investments in affiliates: 265.1
(=) Enterprise Value: 208.0

Preferred and cash are tricky because the company raised about 21.9m from private equity sponsor and other shareholders in November according to the Q316 10Q (pg.49), with the reasons cited for the raise being general working capital needs and payroll.  For simplicities sake, I've assumed that basically all of this capital raised has gone to cash on the BS, and that this cash has not yet been tapped into (for lack of better data).  Therefore, cash is equal to 6.1 that was present on the BS per 10Q plus ~21.9 raised from preferred offering in November.  So this represents by first ""black hole"" of confusion.

My second source of confusion relates to the JVs.  As I understand it, you want to adds noncontrolling interest to EV (JVs where ADPT owns greater than 50%) but subtract any equity investments in affiliates (JVs where ADPT owns less than 50%).  In the formula above, I've simply pulled both from the BS.

Final source of confusion relates to a tax receviable agreement entered into at the time of IPO that entitles the pre-IPO owners (PE firms) to I think 85% of any tax benefit received by the company.  This is equal to 237.9m (close to the market cap of the company).  In the formula above I've excluded this because I have yet to determine how to go about it.  However, as you can tell, subtracting this amount from the enterprise value results in a negative EV.

Appreciate thoughts.  Also if anyone is interested, LTM adjusted EBITDA of this business is 75m per most recent 10Q.  If my math is correct that implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 2.77x.  The only problem is that I am not yet confident of my math at this point.  Thanks! ",5,0.66,1484599735.0

t3_5oyg6r,How do you go about building detailed operating models with limited info?,"Say you're an ordinary individual investor with access just to company filings, equity research notes and basic industry data. How do you build a detailed integrated three statement model, in particular with an bottom-up, granular revenue and cost model within the income statement. (Without calling and asking an analyst to send you his/her model).

Context: 3rd yr analyst in M&A at a BB aiming to break in to the buy side. A lot of places require this kind of modeling test (e.g CD&R give you 7 hours and an old laptop with a stack of 10ks and 5 broker reports to build a 3 statement model, dcf, lbo, comps etc). The valuation approach for me is relatively straightforward, but without knowing a company or industry extremely well I find it difficult to understand how an investor can forecast volume, price/mix, fx by operating segment and geography and have a fair knowledge of the split of cogs by type and split of sg&a by type, the drivers etc. In banking, we are often either given private company info, or detailed due diligence reports from consultants and the big 4s that allow us to build a sensible operating model. A 10k offers very little outside segmental revenues and operating income (sometimes!).

Any recommended resources on this? Books/websites/ paid resources? I'm sure it's often sector specific but any suggestions would be appreciated.

Macabus and other sites I've used are great from a macro perspective but don't offer the granularity that many firms require from prospective new joiners. I'm currently using WSO PE and HF resources and BIWS case studies to practice. Happy to share my thoughts on both but overall I think they're too US focused and should offer an IFrS equivalent! Also on IB for those that may be thinking about it - I would say your exposure to actually building this kind of detailed operating model can be quite limited - and your often stuck with using the company's business plan and flexing upside and downside cases. Not what I'd hoped to be doing!

t3_5rrf3x,Question about average S&P500 P/E,"Many people cite the index average P/E ratio to give a idea of the current valuation and expected returns. The P is just the sum of the market caps of all 500 companies. The E is the sum of earnings (including negative earnings) of the companies. 

By including the negative earnings, the E is lower. In reality, those companies are losing money this year, but they don't necessarily have negative long-term earnings power (maybe next year they will be profitable again). Therefore, does the index P/E underestimate the likely future returns?

t3_5tial3,Excessive Compensation at Leucadia National,"Leucadia National Corporation (NYSE: LUK) is a case study in excessive management compensation despite poor performance.

LUK's stock price today sits around its 12/31/12 closing price of $23.79. That was just prior to the consummation of the merger between Leucadia and Jefferies Group that put the CEO & President duo of Dick Handler and Brian Friedman at the helm, succeeding Leucadia’s Ian Cumming and Joe Steinberg. In the 4+ years since, shareholders have received essentially zero price appreciation and about a dollar per share in dividends. Meanwhile, Handler and Friedman combined have been paid $24 million in cash. That may not be unreasonable, but here's the stinker: in that same time, they’ve also issued themselves 7 million RSUs (net of some RSUs that they loudly forfeited for subpar performance). Those RSUs are worth $160 million at today’s price of ~$24/share. This year, they’ve awarded themselves another 2 million combined RSUs, worth another ~$50 million at today's price. 

LUK’s underperformance is long-term under this management duo. LUK underperformed the S&P Financials by 12% in 2013, 35% in 2014, and 20% in 2015. Finally, in 2016, they beat that group by 13% due to the late-year surge, resulting in a cumulative underperformance in those 4 years of 84%. It’s worth noting that the S&P Financials itself badly underperformed the S&P 500 in these years!

There is no indication that this management team is capable of better performance going forward. Handler’s background is in high yield trading, and all the money has been squeezed out of this long bond bull cycle, while Jefferies Capital Partners, which was Friedman’s work prior to Leucadia, is a bottom quartile private equity firm. The last two Jefferies Capital Partners funds are rumored to be worth less than invested capital.

Ultimately, the main issue isn’t management incompetence, but rather the excessive compensation despite poor returns to shareholders and lack of transparency about that compensation. How can shareholders stand for this? 

For instance, the 2016 compensation package was not finalized and approved until 2/19/16, when the stock price was $14.76. So, they awarded themselves RSUs worth a combined $50 million at that price, even though they correctly tied the performance thresholds for the awards to vest at the 12/31/15 price of $17.39. So instead of those RSUs being worth a combined ~$69 million at the current price/share as they probably should have been, they’re worth ~$81 million! Of course, the details of this compensation plan were published in a late Friday afternoon filing. The fact that they got away with this is extraordinary.

There is an argument that the timing restrictions on sales permits this excessive compensation. Personally, I don’t see how those sale restrictions forgive the sheer magnitude of dilution that shareholders are suffering. Putting figures on that dilution, as of 12/31/16, there were 360 million common shares. If all of the RSUs that Handler and Friedman have awarded themselves in just the last 5 years vest, excluding the forfeited RSUs, they’ll own 2.4% of the common stock from these RSUs alone. How many mature $8 billion market cap businesses run by non-founders pay the CEO/President this excessively?",32,0.94,1486855835.0

t3_5uvbhg,Alliance Resource (ARLP) - Deserves a closer look,"Alliance Resource is a marketer and producer of coal that supplies to United States utilities and industrial users.  ARLP is the nation’s first publicly traded master limited partnership involved in the production of coal.  It currently is the second largest producer in the Eastern United States, operating ten mines.  The company’s mines are located in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia.  

    Third quarter earnings of $.91 per unit beat the consensus estimate by $.18.  Alliance Resources also beat expectations during the second quarter; this trend is expected to continue.  Two factors are benefiting ARLP: a) lower costs and b) stronger than expected demand for thermal coal.  Note that two types of coal exist, metallurgical and thermal.  Metallurgical coal is used for steel making and thermal, which ARLP produces, is used for electricity generation.  Demand has likely increased because of a) increased natural gas prices (natural gas is competition for coal) and b) healthier demand for thermal coal from overseas. 

    Increased commodity prices will certainly help boosts profits for coal, but given that most of the sales are derived from long-term contracts, we won’t see any benefit from improving pricing until next year.  

    I’d regard the management team as exemplary.  Primarily, management closed four high-cost mines, most recently Pattiki (in Carmi, Illinois), over the past year.  Management moved output from these high-cost mines to lower cost mines such as Hamilton. 

    ARLPs units are trading on the lower end of their historical valuation range on both a price to book and price to cash flow basis.  Units haven’t traded this low on a price to cash flow basis since 2010.  Also, the dividend (currently 7.40%) was recently cut back, with the savings going to paying down debt.  The dividend may be cut further if a) coal prices decrease or b) demand weakens. 

    While the current ratio, coming in at .74, may suggest that Alliance Resources lacks sufficient liquidity, this is supported by a $480 million revolving credit facility of senior secured financing, maturing in May of 2019.  If the company needs liquidity, they can draw upon this money just as one would do with a credit card.  ARLP does not incur any debt until they draw on it.  Revolvers are great to provide liquidity/availability if a working capital drain eats up cash flow and the company needs cash.  Alliance Resources can also fund acquisitions under its revolver, then choose to term out heavy revolver draws once they are too drawn.

    Margins are holding up reasonably well and can improve if coal prices pick up because the mines are currently running well below full capacity.  Price to book ratio is 1.7.  Price to sales = 0.9    price to cash flow = 2.5    debt to equity = .2   Interest coverage = 8.81   Operating margin = 35%   Net profit margin = 16.9%   10 yr average return on partners capital and return on capital, respectively = 54.19% and 29.59%. 
Total debt = $773.5 million (also due in 5 years).  Long term debt = $237.3 million and Long term interest of $30 million.  $21.4 million in cash, $278.3 million =current assets, $691.8 million = current liabilities.  Price to owner earnings = 4.05 (min 2.08, max 30.09). Earnings yield 8.23% and dividend yield 7.40%. EV/EBITDA = 3.9 and EBITDA per share = $8.13. 

    I arrive at an intrinsic value of $88.15 per unit based on DCF analysis (FCF based), using a 12% discount rate.

t3_5uwds8,Thoughts on confirmation bias in research process and how you deal with it.,"In the past, I've screened for companies that would have characteristics of an undervalued investment - something like high ROIC, low P/E, low P/B. The default assumption was that these companies were undervalued until I found substantial evidence indicating that share price is low for good reason. However, many companies don't really have big things going for or against them. That left me with a default position where any investment that passed the screen is undervalued, which obviously should not be the case.

Since finding my own bias, I've made a change to my idea generation process. Instead of starting with screens, I started reading the news and when I find an interesting company, I take a quick look at their financials (I'm a big fan of bomb-proof balance sheets). If the financials look half decent, then I start researching. At this point, I have basically mentally committed to researching regardless of whether the report ends up presenting an actionable investment idea or not. In other words, even if I find that a company isn't a particularly interesting investment right now, I'd still work out the details - Figure out the price point at which I find the company to be an interesting investment.

I believe screening is a common tool for idea generation and I imagine that many users probably had a bias similar to mine at some point. I'm curious to hear any thoughts on how you guys dealt with it. Any and all ideas are also welcome, of course :) Thanks in advance!",7,0.82,1487474741.0

With that spending spree behind them, the company will be spending much less on network investments. 

As the network has become faster - users are spending more on data and calls. Monthly phone bills in the US are around $60, whereas in China they are closer to $10. China also has less fixed lines, so people use their mobile more than people in the US.

t3_5w74t4,"Help With Reconciling (McCormick, 2015's Annual Report) Pension","Hi, I hope this is the correct sub to post in (if it is not, please let me know).

I am reading McCormick Annual Report (2015), and I came across something that I could not get right. 

Basically, in page 69, section **17. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATA**, under **Other long-term liabilities**, Pension (which I assumed to be Net Pension Obligation), stood at $192.8 for the year 2015. Fair enough.

So I went back to page 61, **10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND RETIREMENT PLANS**, and got the Funded Status for year 2015. I'll summarise the results below.

|                                          | United State | International |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Benefit obligation at end of year        | $ 722.0      | $308.1        |
| Fair value of plan assets at end of year | $ 548.6      | $288.3        |
| Funded status                            | $(173.4)     | $ (19.8)      |

Adding the results up leads to a missing shortfall of $0.4 

    (173.4 + 19.8 = 193.2)
    (193.2 - 192.8 = 0.4)

So I was wondering where could the difference be? And the gap is even wider for the year 2014, so I doubt it could be simply attributed to currency difference, but I could be wrong.

t3_5w3wzm,Help Understanding EBITDA,"I've been recently looking at VDTH, an Indian telecom company, and have found that nearly every discussion around valuation involves a multiple of EBITDA.  I have always struggled to understand why this measure is used but since it is so ubiquitous, especially within telecom, I was hoping someone with some experience could help .

My thinking against it is that all of the pieces that are getting backed out (except amortization) are expenses which will require cash and are detracting from growth and FCF.  I know depreciation is non-cash on the SCF, but a telecom company will need to replace satellites and customer box tops which costs cash down the line.  And both interest and taxes involve large cash outflows to third parties, again preventing re-investment.  So why is it that within this industry (and many others) people are willing to back out these particular expenses when they materially impact the business?  Thanks in advance for any help.

t3_5wgxu7,What makes an investor letter worth reading?,"When it comes to quarterly/annual investor letters, what separates the wheat from the chaff? (i.e., Baupost and Berkshire's letters providing access to decades worth of experience and wisdom)


For me, I like when managers layout their thesis for a current position in detail and/or provide a post-mortem analysis of an exited one. This provides transparency and shows humility - both of which are apart of what makes BRK letters so powerful. 


In my opinion that goes a lot further than long-winded discussions of the political environment, fiscal policy, sector valuations and other general musings.


Curious to see what thoughts/opinions there are on this subject.

> Created as an incentive to fund drug development in areas where Congress believes the public good to be inadequately captured by commercial value, PRVs are transferable vouchers that entitle a drug sponsor to receive an expedited six-month priority review normally reserved for breakthrough therapies, as opposed to the normal ten-month review.  For a drug that is expected to be a huge commercial success but is not innovative enough to warrant a priority review on its merits, the PRV shortens time-to-market by 4 months, pulling forward large cash flows and effectively extending the patent life.  In many cases, speed-to-market has strategic advantages that cannot be measured by simple cash flow analysis.  For these reasons, PRVs have been purchased for as much as $350 million.

t3_5wuld3,Treating non-cancellable purchase obligations (AMD),"Hi, I'm wondering what's the recommended approach for treating non-cancellable purchase obligations from suppliers - do you consider it effectively a form of debt, and as such capitalize it as you would with operating leases, or no?

Case in point, AMD's 2016 10-K, page 42. Here's the relevant section: http://imgur.com/MyAqYzJ

You can download the full document here: http://ir.amd.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=74093&p=irol-sec

Purchase obligations, including obligations to Globalfoundries (their wafer supply partner), are a total of $3.7 bln. These are the minimum, non-cancellable amounts. This is obviously quite significant, as it comprises over 50% of total long-term contractual commitments, and can potentially have a huge impact on the company's valuation.

On one hand, I think they should be included, as these represent real cash outflows that will not go towards equity holders.

On the other hand, since they are payments to suppliers, presumably they would be reflected in future COGS. Therefore, as long as future COGS are above this floor set by minimum purchase obligations, there is no need to capitalize them. Basically, if I were to do a DCF, and I projected higher COGS than these numbers, there would be no need to adjust for them. At the moment, I'm leaning towards this.

Any thoughts? (As an aside, I think AMD is quite a bit overvalued at the moment...)",4,0.67,1488360424.0

t3_5x6f74,Trip Advisor Inc vs. Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings,"Hi everyone - there is something about this pair of stocks that I do not get. Here is the context:

Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings (HoldCo) is a holding company that spun out of Liberty Interactive Corporation back in Aug-2014. Liberty Trip Advisor Holdings, the HoldCo, owns two subsidiaries: TripAdvisor Inc (Operating Co), which is publicly listed. And secondly, BuySeasons Inc which makes a tiny part of the holdings' value. You can see in the latest 10-K that it makes up $52m of $1.5Bn revenue. HoldCo owns 21% of TripAdvisor but has 57% of the voting rights so the 10-K reports on a fully consolidated basis.

So, we have here a case where a listed holding company's only asset is a stake in another listed operating company (lets make the assumption that BuySeason is negligible to the HoldCo's $1Bn market cap). We can see from the 10-K, of the consolidated balance sheet reported, $464m of Debt are attached to HoldCo, and not of the operating company's (see the note (7) Debt). We can also see (footnote of Item 6 Selected Financial Data) that of $654m reported cash, $612m is held by TripAdvisor. Meaning, HoldCo has only $42m in cash.

HoldCo has a Net Debt position of $422m, out of a Market Cap of $1Bn. Implying a leverage ratio of 1.42 = [ where I define Leverage Ratio as (D+E)/E]. 

Theoretically, I understood that if a HoldCo is levered, its returns should follow the return of the operating asset multiplied by the leverage factor. I.e. With a 1.4 leverage ratio, if the asset increase in value by 10%, the equity portion of the HoldCo should increase by 14%. It's a straightforward idea in finance, if I have a leveraged portfolio of only 1 stock, my portfolio returns will be a multiple of that stock. 

Suppose we establish that HoldCo - Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings' only material holdings is that 1 stock, TripAdvisor. It is levered (assuming I did not miss anything else in the 10-K). Theoretically I would expect HoldCo's stock returns to be a multiple of TripAdvisor's. But, that is not the case. [Stock Performance on Google Finance: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7B8aDSP1nTjYVlNYzJoem5ObTQ/view?usp=sharing] - the returns of the 2 stocks are moving in lock step!

They look perfectly correlated. The pairing would be great for putting together a market neutral position. But, knowing there is leverage in the HoldCo, the theory does not stack up with the price movements. The stocks are moving as if HoldCo has no leverage. What do you think will explain this? Did I miss something significant?

t3_5xxl9c,An easier way to get financial data straight into Excel and Google Sheets,"**Our Backstory:**

Over the last two years, my friend and business partner (/u/tractortractor) and I have been working as freelance software developers in the finance space. We’ve done several projects for small to mid-sized firms here in Chicago and during that period had to communicate regularly with “top-tier” financial data providers such as Morningstar and Thomson Reuters.

We had to go through countless conference calls before even seeing price information regarding the product, inaccuracies in the data itself, and old technologies. The worst part was the conference calls, the worst time was when we had to sit through 5 of them over the course of a month before we even saw a price sheet.

At a certain point, we said, “Enough is enough.” We were developers, we had studied and worked in the finance space, “This should be easy we thought.” It wasn’t, but in the end, every roadblock that popped up in our way only gave us more motivation to succeed.

**The Product:**

t3_5zjx0m,Eagle Bulk Shipping [EGLE] long investment thesis,"Hi everyone,

Here is a stock pitch I've been working on over the past month or so. I have submitted the long version of this post to some value investing firms since after 4 years of reading about investing and trying it on my own, I've decided this is something I want to do seriously and as a career. I know I've seen some posts on here about the shipping industry and how everyone is basically taking their capital from that industry so that's what sparked my interest. Anyways the crux of this thesis is basically who can bleed the longest before things get better in the dry bulk shipping industry. This was a pretty tough one since its a commodity business and really there is no differentiation besides good management. Any counter arguments and critiques are welcome and encouraged. So anyway here's the thesis.

Thesis:

I place a target price for Eagle Bulk Shipping in a range between $ 6.55 - $8.78 per share based on it's Net Asset Value per share (NAV). Currently it is at $ 5.59. This represents a 17 % - 57 % upside based on its vessel values being worth 50 % -60 % of what book value states and an additional 50 % - 100% shares issued through private placement.

Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc is dry bulk shipping company that specializes in owning Suprmax dry bulk vessels which transport commodity products such as coal, ore, petcoke, and grain. The average age of the fleet is 8.6 years as of September 2016.  Supramax vessels have the additional flexibility of onboard cranes which allow ease of loading and unloading cargo, unlike other vessel types such as the Panamax which require port facilities to load and unload their cargoes. 

Eagle Bulk Shipping is trading at multiples of current ratio of 4.99, debt to equity ratio of .46, and cash to interest ratio of 6.5. This is compared to the average current ratio of 3.88, average debt to equity of .69 and average cash to interest expense of 4.10. The peer group is composed of 5 other different dry bulk shipping companies: Golden Ocean (GOGL), Scorpio Bulkers Inc (SALT), Navios Maritime Partners L.P. (NMM), Diana Shipping (DSX), and Safe Bulkers Inc (SB). 

The Dry Bulk Shipping market is currently depressed due to an oversupply of ships built and ordered back in 2008 because of China’s fast growing economy. As a result of China’s economy slowing and a surplus of ships, vessel values have decreased. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI), a daily average of charter rates, reached an all time low of 290 in February 2016. As a result, Eagle Bulk Shipping is trading at base case Price to NAV multiple of .84 which is the lowest in its peer group. Eagle Bulk Shipping has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and new management yet is trading at a bigger discount to its NAV then its peers. 

The stock is mispriced for the following reason:

1.	In a worst case scenario if vessels are written down to 40 % - 50 % of their book value and shares are increased by 80 % - 100 % over the next 6 – 18 months, NAV per share can range from   $ 3.24 - $ 5.46 per share which results in a – 41 % to – 1 % downside. 

2.	The base case assumes the vessels are valued between 40 % - 60% of book value and total shares issued only increase 20 % - 50 % over the next 6 – 18 months. In this case, NAV per share will fall in between $ 6.55 - $ 10.97 giving an 18 % - 98 % upside. 

3.	In a best case scenario, shares outstanding will remain the same or an extra 20% are issued over the next 6 – 18 months.  Assuming vessels are at 50 % - 60 % of book value, NAV can range from      $ 8.19 - $ 13.17 per share which offers a 48 % - 138 % upside. 

In all three cases, I am assuming they do not use excess cash to pay off any debt for the next 6 -18 months. Realistically, Eagle Bulk Shipping is obligated to pay 75 % of excess cash flow June 2017 and December 2017. 

Catalysts in the next 6 – 18 months include:

1.	The Ballast Water Management Convention coming into force September 2017

2.	The Orderbook on new ships built is at a 10 year low

The Ballast Water Management Convention is designed to help prevent the spread of aquatic organisms when ships travel between ports. Most ships will need to install on-board systems to help treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Management will have to determine if it is economically feasible to continue running older ships, who may only have 5-7 years left, with new equipment or scrap the older vessels.
 
Ships older than 16 years represent approximately 14% of the total fleet tonnage which if scrapped due to the new Ballast Water Management Convention will greatly increase charter rates. The second catalyst is dependent on new ships being built. With fewer ships out on water, charter rates and NAV would increase. At the end of 2016, new ships Dwt are only 10% of existing fleet which is a 10 year low. 
 
With such a low amount of new ships being ordered, supply and demand could return charter rates to profitable levels again which would benefit Eagle Bulk Shipping since its break even cost on charter rates is second lowest among its peer group.
 
The most relevant investment risks for Eagle Bulk Shipping include:

1.	Global economy slows down which will further depress vessel values and charter rates

2.	Stockholder dilution through private placement of more stock

3.	Dry Bulk Shipping companies may preemptively order new ships built in anticipation of the cycle turning which would further depress vessel values

4.	Defaulting on debt 

If the global economy, specifically big coal and iron ore importers like China and India, slows down, then there would be an additional headwind contributing to demand the dry bulk shipping industry would face. The prolonged depression in charter rates could lead to a possible chain reaction of different risks playing out. The low charter rates could cause Eagle Bulk Shipping to offer more shares in private placements to maintain liquidity and current shareholders would be diluted. Now, if the company cannot successfully raise more capital due to a slowing economy then they may default on their first lien debt. On a similar note, it’s second lien debt is very expensive and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 14.00% per annum (with a 1.0% LIBOR floor) or the Base Rate (as defined in the Second Lien Loan Agreement) plus 13.00% per annum, paid in kind quarterly in arrears. Even though the company only has to pay excess cash flow for its semi-annual debt payments (which could be $ 0 in a best case scenario and would not pose a problem for liquidity), the bigger concern would be that the dry bulk shipping industry does not improve in the next 12 – 24 months. The Ballast Management Water Convention set to be in full effect September 2017 may have no impact on ship scrapping and charter rates may remain the same. Lastly, one of the biggest risk factors is undisciplined management in the dry bulk shipping industry. Back in 2013 – 2014 ship owners began to preemptively order new ships in anticipation of a reversal in market conditions. This feedback loop caused prices in charter rate to dip again which decreased the order book for 2015. It is likely that such a feedback loop could play out again before charter rates reach profitable levels. This lack of discipline also resulted in an over ordering of ships back in 2008 which began the drop in the dry bulk shipping industry.

t3_5zhbwq,Roche vs. Novartis Profitability,"Hopefully someone with a pharma background can help me out with this, but I've recently looked into Roche and Novartis and noticed something peculiar.

Both companies are approximately the same size, with Roche having about $50.11b and Novartis having about $48.5b in 2016 revenues, however Roche only had about $9.6b in 2016 net income, while Novartis has about $17.8b in 2016 net income (almost twice the amount). 2015 had a similar discrepancy between the two with Novartis posting a much higher net income. It is only back in 2014 where both had a similar net income - Novartis had $10.2b in 2014 net income and Roche had $9.5b that same year. 

Given that these two companies are essentially the same size, have almost identical revenues and are in the same industry, what allowed Novartis to essentially post **double** the net income Roche had?

My guess for the divergence these past 2 years is Novartis asset sales, but I would love if someone who knows more about these two companies could give some insight, and possibly whether Novartis (which had a decline in revenue YoY in 2016) is headed down to Roche's level of net income in the future.

I'm looking at GM's Cash Flow statement and I see an item here called ""Purchases of leased vehicles, net."" It's under ""Cash Used for Investing."" I've been digging around and haven't been able to find a good definition for it.

I think it refers to money they've spent on purchasing vehicles that were previously leased. But that doesn't make sense to me. I thought the creditor owned the vehicle being leased, and then the dealership could buy it from the creditor once the lease was up to resell it as a used vehicle. Why would they be buying them?

Marcus & Millichap is a real estate investment and finance brokerage firm. They operate in a simple to understand business: the biggest stream of revenue comes from collecting commission on real estate sales, mostly from properties in the $1-$10 Million bracket. Because of the nature of the business, it requires very little capital to run. This allows the company to achieve returns on real capital that routinely exceeded 20%, while keeping virtually no debt on its balance sheet.

Despite these factors, they are cheaply priced, at a price of about $1bn on $65m earnings, which seems very low to me because you need very little money to stay in the business to keep it operational.

I'm in charge to find out why a company went bankrupt for the court. I'm calculating the WACC of the company one year before it declared the bankruptcy.  
  
The equity of the company is negative (too many losses acumulated).  
  
The company has $1,319,629 of bank loans and the equity is $-323,349. The participation of third-party capital is 132% and own capital is -32%. So this give me a negative WACC.  
  
How to deal if it? Should I consider the third capitals 100% and private capitals 0%?",12,0.81,1491491000.0
t3_63rdvt,Need some help with a valuation spreadsheet,"Hi, 

I'm using Valuation by McKinsey to polish up on my valuation skills, and I'm trying to wrap my head around how they organize their spreadsheet. The excerpt I'm confused about is posted below: 

>COMPONENTS OF A GOOD MODEL

>If you combine 15 years of financial forecasts with 10 years of historical analysis,
any valuation spreadsheet becomes complex. Therefore, you need to design
and structure your model before starting to forecast. Many designs are possible.
In our example (see Exhibit 11.1), the spreadsheet contains seven worksheets:

>1. Raw historical data: Collect raw data from the company’s financial statements,
footnotes, and external reports in one place. By keeping the datatogether, you can verify information as needed and update data year by
year. Report the raw data in their original form.

>2. Integrated financial statements: Using figures from the raw-data worksheet,
create a set of historical financials that find the right level of
detail. As a general rule, operating and nonoperating items should not
be aggregated within the same line item. The income statement should
be linked with the balance sheet through retained earnings. This worksheet
will contain historical and forecast financial statements.

>3. Historical analysis and forecast ratios: For each line item in the financial
statements, build historical ratios, as well as forecasts of future ratios.
These ratios will generate the forecast financial statements contained on
the previous sheet.

>4. Market data and weighted average cost of capital (WACC): Collect all
financial market data on one worksheet. This worksheet will contain
estimates of beta, the cost of equity, the cost of debt, and the weighted
average cost of capital, as well as historical market values and trading
multiples for the company.

>5. Reorganized financial statements: Once you have built a complete set of
financial statements (both historical and forecast), reorganize the financial
statements to calculate NOPLAT, its reconciliation to net income,
invested capital, and its reconciliation to total funds invested.
>6. ROIC and FCF: Use the reorganized financials to build return on invested
capital, economic profit, and free cash flow. Future free cash flow will be
the basis of your valuation.

>7. Valuation summary: This worksheet presents discounted cash flows, discounted
economic profits, and final results. The valuation summary
includes the value of operations, value of nonoperating assets, value of
nonequity claims, and resulting equity value.  

I'm currently on Step 2. Here's where I'm confused. First, do I reorganize the raw data to separate operating/non-operating items, as well as debt/equity in the second spreadsheet? Then do I have to reorganize the data again to calculate NOPLAT in Step 5? If this is the case, how to I find the right level of detail to reorganize the statements in this step? At this point, should I be making other worksheets to detail operating lease commitments, options, debt schedules, etc? This seems like it would be the most tedious step, so is there anything I should be doing to keep things organized? 

Second question - it says that the worksheet in Step 2 should contain historical and forecast financial statements. But previously it says information should flow down the spreadsheets, not up. And in order to forecast financials, I need to calculate the ratios in Step 3 first. So the information flow would end up going Raw Data --> Integrated Financials --> Historical Analysis and Forecast Ratios --> Integrated Financials. Is this correct? 

Thanks!",4,0.75,1491461880.0

t3_64dlbq,Your input on Beta calculation welcomed,"When analyzing companies and implementing WACC beta is an important variable. But I also find that in every text it is the topic that most causes my brain to go numb. For example, the section in McKinsey or the B/M/A text about beta theory, approaches, and calculations seems to get so verbose and sideways from implementation that I feel myself disengaging while reading. 
My question is: what is your preferred approach to calculating beta? Are there any resources you trust / use to deliver a reliable beta for your models? (I.e. Bloomberg, Morningstar, etc...) Do you prefer / find it useful to take the time to calculate your own or do you find the time saved by using a data resource provided Beta adequate given the time saved?

t3_66593r,need online broker recommendations for $5M+ account,"Hi guys, I'm not really sure where to find this (without just default to using Interactive Brokers), so I was hoping to pick someone's brain on here.

My current employer (a small insurance company) is giving me a small book of my own to manage, starting with $5M and the potential to bump up to $10M and more, depending on my performance (and if the market goes down, they’ll allocate more to me). Basically, this money would be wired into a managed account under one of the subsidiaries of the insurance company, with me managing it directly.

Given that they are an insurance company, most of the $1.5B+ in assets is invested in bonds for regulatory reasons, and they are pretty heavy in trading bonds, primarily high quality corporate, municipal, government, etc.

However, I'm about to be their first equity/special situations/distressed focused guy. They have asked me to decide on which broker I would like to use. This is really out of my wheelhouse, as far who would be best broker to use.

My personal experience from trading my PA for the past 10+ years is TD Ameritrade. I don’t think they would be a good option for an institutional size account like $5M.

The following would be the requirements for the account:

- the account would need to be tied in with the insurance company’s existing accounting/tax people, so that my returns can be tracked (for the purpose of helping me build a track record that I can market to investors in the future)
- should hopefully have an easy online interface. I will have a Bloomberg Terminal for research purposes, but I will likely place trades from my Mac.
- need margin and full options capabilities because I will be shorting, mostly to hedge
- international access preferable, although not a big thing here since I will mostly be US focused, as well as Europe and probably Japan
- focus will be on small and mid cap special situations, mostly equities, followed by debt and sometimes hybrid securities like preferred stock and things like warrants, CVR’s, credit default swaps, etc.

I have experience with the regular hedge fund prime brokers (Jefferies, Wells Fargo, etc.), but this setup is too small for them I believe; I’d never meet their minimum revenue requirements. I doubt any of them will take me on for $5M alone.

I’ve heard Interactive Brokers being throw around, but their website is horrible (I wired in money into a PA there once, and then pulled it all out 1 day later because I couldn’t stand it - I’ve also heard their customer service is bad). I don’t know if I could handle IB for this purpose. I’ve also heard horror stories about their margin policies, as far as raising margin requirements overnight and if you don’t make changes to your portfolio immediately, .

Would some kind of discount broker like Ameritrade or Scotttrade or Fidelity be able to take on an account like this for an insurance company? I’m assuming we should be able to negotiate margin rates, but I doubt anyone can beat a real prime broker or even Interactive Brokers.

Is it worth talking to a mini-prime broker like Weeden or BTIG? would that be the best option? Or should I try contacting one of the online discount brokers like TD Ameritrade and see what they could offer for a $5M+ account?",2,0.58,1492545298.0

t3_66acsw,Berkshire Hathaway is Undervalued,"I posted this on my [blog](http://www.slowappreciation.com/blog/2017/4/16/berkshire-hathaway-brkb), and figure some here might find it worth a discussion.

**INTRODUCTION**

Berkshire Hathaway is a conservatively-run, well-capitalized business, managed by one of the greatest CEOs of all time. It uses minimal leverage, operates across many recession-resilient industries, and has grown earnings 20% per year since 1999. Businesses like this rarely trade for less than 20x earnings. Berkshire Hathaway trades for 7x.

While the company is best known for being a collection of “Warren Buffett’s stock picks”, it now derives a significant—and growing—portion of its value from another source: earnings from the company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. We argue that this latter group—whose earnings exceed those of Amazon, Google, Netflix, Tesla, Twitter, and Uber; combined—is being under-appreciated by the market.

**BUSINESS HISTORY**

In 1964, Warren Buffett took control of a struggling New England textile manufacturer, named Berkshire Hathaway. Its net worth was $22m at the time. Fifty years and $411b later, Berkshire Hathaway is now the fourth largest company in the US, with a reach so wide it makes money nearly every time:

* a plane is flown
* a car is sold
* a house is built 
* goods are transported to/from the West Coast
* an iPhone is purchased
* a lightbulb goes on in Nevada
* someone drinks a Coke
* a french fry is dipped in ketchup
* [and the guy at DQ does this](http://shenzhenphotos.com/images/20101213144523_upside%20down%20blizzard.jpg)

So how did Buffett grow a modest textile company into a sprawling conglomerate—one that now owns dozens of operating companies and a stock portfolio worth $150b?  

In the decades after taking control of Berkshire, Buffett steered the company through three major—and lucrative—shifts. He began in the late 1960s by acquiring insurance companies. Then he started using the insurance premiums generated by their operations to buy shares of publicly traded companies. Finally, in the 1990s, he began buying large businesses outright. 

**Phase I**: Buying Insurance Companies to Generate Float

The first step took place in 1967, when Berkshire purchased a small Nebraskan insurance company called National Indemnity for $8.6m. Buffett was drawn to characteristics unique to the insurance business: cash—in the form of premiums—is collected years before claims are paid out. In the meantime, the insurance company is free to invest it. This money is commonly referred to as “float”. Buffett explains further:

“Float is money we hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the money. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay. That leaves it running an ‘underwriting loss’, which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.”

In other words: for most insurers, the combined cost of running their business and paying out claims usually exceeds the money they receive from premiums. Most insurers make up for these underwriting losses by profitably investing their float. If they just so happen to earn an underwriting profit—that is, if premiums ultimately exceed the cost of running the business plus the cost of claims—it’s simply a bonus. 

Unlike most insurers, Berkshire consistently earns an underwriting profit. So not only does Berkshire get to invest the float, but it’s effectively paid to do so! Buffett says, “That’s like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay you interest.” 

An insurer that consistently generates float and earns an underwriting profit is a great business. Still, Buffett saw more potential. Instead of investing the float in conservative and low-yielding bonds like a traditional insurance company does, Buffett took a new approach: he used the float to buy stock in other companies selling for reasonable prices.

**Phase II**: Using Float to Buy Partial Ownership of Other Companies (i.e., Stocks)

Throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, Buffett used the proceeds from Berkshire’s insurance businesses to buy shares of a number of fantastic companies—such as Coca Cola, American Express, and The Washington Post—which were at the time selling for far less than their intrinsic values. By investing the borrowed money (i.e., float) that Berkshire was in effect being paid to hold, Buffett was able to lever his returns—earning Berkshire and its shareholders 20%+ per year. Even better, this leverage came from owned insurance operations rather than debt—which meant Berkshire reaped all the benefits of leverage without shouldering its traditional downside (such as interest expenses and an increase in risk).

Until the early 1990s, Berkshire Hathaway was in essence a lightly-leveraged, publicly-traded stock portfolio, managed by an unusually prudent investor. But as Berkshire grew in size, it became increasingly difficult to find opportunities in publicly traded companies that were large enough to move the needle. So Buffett changed track for the third time: he began acquiring operating businesses outright.

**Phase III**: Buying Full Ownership of Operating Businesses

hough Buffett did buy a few operating businesses in the 1970s and 1980s, it wasn't until the 1990s that he started doing so in earnest. Present-day Berkshire fully owns dozens of businesses, including: GEICO, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, Dairy Queen, Benjamin Moore Paints, Clayton Homes, and ACME Brick. At first, the collective net worth of these businesses was dwarfed by Berkshire’s investment portfolio. And to this day it is the investment portfolio which remains the focus for most investors. But as Buffett continued to acquire simple, stable businesses that possessed what he deemed favorable long-term competitive advantages, their total value swelled. Today, they make up half of Berkshire’s intrinsic value.

**PRESENT-DAY BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

I. What is the Value of Berkshire’s Investment Portfolio (and Cash & Bonds)?

Included in this half of Berkshire’s value are its cash, bonds, and 5%-15% partial ownership stakes in companies such as American Express, Kraft Heinz, Apple, Coca Cola, IBM, Bank of America, and many others. Valuing Berkshire’s investment portfolio is simple. Since “cash is cash”, and the market prices the stocks and bonds every day, one needs only to look up the price and the number of shares owned by Berkshire to get an approximation of their worth:

[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/ayoXqDS.png)

An investor can then apply a premium or a discount, based on whether current market prices are under or overvalued.  An argument could be made that Berkshire’s stock portfolio warrants a slight premium in light of Buffett’s investing prowess, but for simplicity’s sake we are assigning no premium, and assume the market is pricing each company correctly. 

After summing up available cash, stocks, bonds, and preferred shares, we get $257b worth of investments.

|Book Value|Per B Share
:--:|:--:|:--:                               
Cash|$66.3b|$27
Stocks|$120.5b|$49
Bonds|$23.8b|$10
Preferred/Warrants|$17.3b|$7
Kraft Heinz|$29.6b|$12
**Total**|**$257.5b**|**$105**

On a per share basis, this totals $105, or 64% of Berkshire's current $163/share price. 

II. What is the Value of Berkshire’s Operating Businesses?

The rest of Berkshire’s value comes from its operating businesses. After backing out the $105/share of investments from Berkshire’s current share price ($163), the remainder—or $58/share—is what the market believes the operating businesses are worth. 

[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/KdpdCHX.png)

Since the true value of its investment portfolio is more or less determined by the market, the question of whether or not Berkshire is properly valued at $163/share comes down to this: is $58/share a fair price to pay for Berkshire’s operating businesses? Considering these companies earned $8.56/share (pre-tax) in 2016, we feel that paying $58/share for this group—or 7x earnings—is a bargain.

Let’s break this down. Berkshire’s group of wholly-owned operating businesses has grown20%/yr for nearly two decades, earning $21b ($8.56/share) in 2016. Broadly speaking, its businesses fall into one of five segments: insurance; Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE); Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF); Manufacturing, Services, & Retailing (MSR); and Finance & Financial Products. 

[Berkshire Segment Subsidiaries](http://i.imgur.com/GArlySE.png)

**1. Insurance**

*2016 earnings: $2.1b (10 % of total)
*Companies: GEICO, General Re, National Indemnity, etc. 

Since the purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire’s insurance operations have become the largest and most profitable in the world. They have delivered 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits—a feat unheard of in the industry. 

Aside from unusually consistent earnings, the insurance group provides Berkshire with an even greater benefit discussed earlier: float. At year end 2016, the company’s float—money that Berkshire holds but does not own—stood at over $100b. This free financing is available to Berkshire to acquire more businesses across a range of industries.

**2. Finance and Financial Products**

* 2016 earnings: $2.1b (10% of total)
* Companies: Clayton Homes, XTRA, Marmon, CORT

This is Berkshire’s smallest group, made up of companies that specialize in mobile home manufacturing/financing, furniture rentals, and equipment leasing. 

**3. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE)**

* 2016 earnings: $2.7b (13% of total)
* Companies: NV Energy, MidAmerican Energy, PacifiCorp, etc. 

Berkshire Hathaway Energy is a group of regulated utilities, renewable power sources, and gas pipelines operating in Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Oregon, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Regulators allow these monopolies to exist, in exchange for a limit on how much they can earn. Even with these limits in place, this group of companies provides predictable and recession-proof earnings, with the important added benefit of allowing Berkshire to defer billions of dollars in taxes because of their large capital expenditure needs. 

**4. Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railroad (BNSF)**

* 2016 earnings: $5.7b (27% of total)
* Companies: Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad

Railroads play a vital role within the US economy; they ship goods from point A to point B more efficiently and cheaply than all other forms of transport. And because railroads require massive amounts of capital, land, equipment, and government cooperation, these companies are virtually impossible to duplicate—making disruption by a new competitor extremely unlikely. 

The railroad industry is made up of regional duopolies, with BNSF and Union Pacific controlling the western US. While their earnings are cyclical and highly dependent on the health of the national economy, their long-term returns will almost assuredly be above average. Since acquiring BNSF in 2010 for $30b, the company has already earned a total of $24b, and is now the second largest contributor to Berkshire’s operating profit. Like the BHE group, BNSF requires large amounts of capital investment every year to maintain the infrastructure. And just like BHE, these capital outlays can be used to defer taxes at the parent-level for decades to come. Being able to “pay today’s taxes tomorrow” is another nice little form of float; one that lets Berkshire profitably—and tax-efficiently—reinvest billions of dollars back into both segments. 

Said more simply: owning utilities is not a way to get rich; it’s a way to stay rich. And Berkshire intends on staying rich.

**5. Manufacturing, Services, and Retailing**

* 2016 earnings: $8.5b (40% of total)
* Companies: See’s Candy, Lubrizol, Dairy Queen, Marmon, The Pampered Chef, etc. 

This segment drives the lion’s share of Berkshire’s operating earnings. It is an eclectic collection of businesses, selling everything from Dilly Bars to partial ownership of private jets. As a whole, the group earns very respectable returns on capital—with almost no use of financial leverage. Furniture, ice cream, airplane parts, and underwear may not be the most trendy businesses in the world, but they’re safe, stable, and profitable, with many earning 15%-20%/year. 

Together, these five groups earned $21b last year for Berkshire, or $8.56/share.

|Pre-Tax Earnings|Per B Share
:--:|:--:|:--:                               
Underwriting|$2.1b|$0.86
BHE|$2.7b|$1.10
BNSF|$5.7b|$2.31
MSR|$8.5b|$3.43
Financial Products|$2.1b|$0.85
**Total**|**$21.1b**|**$8.56**

**Are Berkshire’s Operating Businesses Being Fairly Valued by the Market?**

Back to the question: Is $58/share a fair price to pay for Berkshire’s operating businesses? 

For $58/share, investors are getting $8.56 of earnings generated by a group of stable companies that: earn solid returns on capital; have been vetted by an investor widely recognized as the greatest of all time; have grown earnings at 20%/yr since 1999; are unlikely to be disrupted by technological advances; and have long-term competitive advantages. 

A standalone company with similar characteristics would probably trade above $170/share. Yet Berkshire’s operating business group trades for only $58. Perhaps if Berkshire renamed this part of their business Berkshire Hathaway AI Biotech Cloud Data Inc., it would it start trading at a more appropriate level. To put this in perspective, let’s imagine that certain popular tech companies started trading at a similar multiple to Berkshire’s operating businesses. Google’s share price would be $245 (versus actual $823); Netflix’s would be $4.50 (versus actual $142); and Amazon’s would be $64 (versus actual $884).

So how many times earnings should an investor be willing to pay for Berkshire’s operating businesses? Each of the five groups has different economic characteristics, so one could apply specific multiples to each (for example, 10x for insurance, 12x for BHE, 15x for BNSF, 15x for MSR, and 10x for Financial Products are probably appropriate). Doing so may yield a more precise (and probably higher) assessment of Berkshire's worth. But with either approach, the message is clear: the market is undervaluing Berkshire.  

We apply a simple—and rather conservative—10x multiple to Berkshire’s group of operating businesses, which yields $85/share in value. When combined with its $105/share of stocks, bonds, and cash, this puts Berkshire’s intrinsic value at somewhere around $190/share—a 15% premium to today’s price.

**Conclusion**

50 years ago, Berkshire Hathaway was a struggling New England textile manufacturer. The business—which required a lot of capital, was barely profitable, and had no long-term competitive advantages—was not a good one. But Warren Buffett decided to buy it anyway, thinking the company’s assets (e.g., machines, factories, accounts receivable, etc.) were worth more than the price he could could pay for the entire business. After assuming control, business steadily deteriorated, and it became apparent the market had been right—Berkshire was a dud. 

Half a century later, Berkshire Hathaway is far from a dud. In fact, it’s probably one of the best companies in the world. While the textile business is long gone, what remains is an investment portfolio worth $105/share, and a collection steadily growing, well managed, and very profitable businesses, that together earned $8.56/share in 2016. A company like that should trade for 20x earnings. Berkshire is available for 1/3rd that.",93,0.93,1492610432.0

t3_66uuiv,"Kingstone Companies Inc (KINS), a fast growing P&C insurance company","This is my first public post of a security analysis. Any feedback or constructive criticism for improvement on analysis or writing will be highly appreciated. 

Kingstone is an insurance company that has been operating mainly in New York for over 131 years. It has been very profitable in recent years due to the company’s massive restructuring in 2009. The restructuring involved selling most of its underperforming assets and operations as well as acquiring KICO and commencing its operations as a property and casualty insurance company. Earnings have increased almost every year since 2009 and will most likely continue to increase due to Kingstone’s promising future plans for expansion.  

Kingstone plans to expand in two ways:

* Improving A.M. Best rating to A- Excellent
* Expanding sales and operations into neighboring states

**Improving A.M. Best rating to A- Excellent**

**Why focus on a “A” rating?**

With the current B++ rating (one grade below A-), Kingstone cannot be competitive in insuring high valued homes and commercial liability, as the broker agents or client contracts often require an A- rating or better. High valued homes and commercial liability are two lucrative and high-demand markets that will allow Kingstone to continue to grow its sales in existing and future locations. In the event Kingstone’s current clients now require insurance from an A-rated carrier, a higher rating will also ensure higher retention rates.

**How does Kingstone plan to raise their rating?**  

During 2017 Q1, Kingstone issued 2.7M new shares of common stock in a public offering, raising $23M to be used in support of the ratings upgrade plan and anticipated growth (geographic and product expansion). Kingstone relies on quota share reinsurance, an agreement that allows Kingstone to share policy liabilities and premiums with other insurers. The a appropriate level of reliance on reinsurance is one of the factors of A.M. Best’s rating evaluation. As such, Kingstone plans to reduce their reliance on quota share reinsurance, which they believe could lead to a rating upgrade.

On April 12, 2017, A.M. Best announced the upgrade of KICO’s financial strength rating from B++ to A-.  The ratings were “based on the improved risk-adjusted capitalization of KICO, following a $23.0 million capital contribution from KINS on March 1, 2017; improved underwriting results and operating returns in recent years; and increased catastrophe reinsurance coverage.”

**Expanding Sales and Operation into Neighboring States**

Kingstone plans to expand its current New York operation into contiguous states, as the company is licensed to do business in New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Kingstone’s current success is due to providing extraordinary service to small-sized agents who are often disregarded by major insurance companies. In return, the insurance agents place their business with Kingstone as well as provide market and product feedback. Kingstone plans to duplicate its success in neighboring states following the same business approach.

**Analyzing the Numbers**

**P/E**

Kingstone’s current P/E ratio is 13.60, and its 3-year trailing P/E is 17 (current stock price / 3 year average EPS). Because P/E should dictate the desired company’s earnings growth, we would want at least 17% growth for the next few years for the price purchased at today. I am choosing the 3-year trailing, as my margin of safety, as it shows a more consistent view of what the company has been earning and what we are paying for that earning today. Since the 2009 restructuring, Kingstone has had a 7-year average net income growth of 49% and EPS (diluted) growth of 43%, with recent averages still strongly above 17%.

**Diluting Outstanding Shares**

One concern with Kingstone issuing new shares to fund expansion is that it dilutes the EPS, lowering the value of each share for its shareholders. To ensure that Kingstone’s growth plan makes sense, we need to analyze how effective Kingstone has historically been with newly raised capital from issuance of new shares. On December 13, 2013, Kingstone issued 3,450,000 new shares, raising $18,804,000 and increasing their outstanding shares by 90%. The result was that when comparing the averages over the next three years to those of the previous three years, revenue had increased 120%, net income had increased by 301%, and EPS had increased by 137%. Not only had revenue drastically increased, but Kingstone was also able to significantly reduce operating cost to the point where EPS growth exceeded revenue growth.

**How well does Kingstone have to perform?**

In February 2017, Kingstone issued 2.7M new shares, increasing its outstanding shares by 35%. With our required growth rate of 17%, Kingstone will have to increase net income by 142% by the end of the year in order to justify the share dilution from raising new capital.

**Conclusion**

Kingstone is in a prime position to expand and duplicate its success across the Northeast region. Operating in New York, Kingstone was able to obtain its rating upgrade in Q1, which allows the company to enter and become competitive in the high valued homes and commercial liability markets. The main challenge for Kingstone would be to duplicate its success in states outside of New York, which has yet to be proven. The specific focus will be on New Jersey, which according to the U.S. Census Bureau, is the state with the seventh largest property and casualty insurance market in the nation.

I realize that equity risk premiums for individual stocks are generally based upon the market where the revenues are collected, using risk free rate + weighted average risk premium from different revenue areas.  But I am curious, what if I use the implied equity risk premium (IRR) method on a single stock using current price, dividend yield (including any buybacks), forecast growth rate for high growth period, T-bond rate for terminal growth period and find an implied risk premium for a single issue. What info would this IRR illuminate for me?  Basically, I'm curious as to how I should think about the output in context of an analysis.  

My first impression is that this would be an implied hurdle rate, although I know it's not at all the conventional measure to calculate a hurdle rate. But as an investor shouldn't I check this number and compare it to my assumptions about the company if they can really generate this return over a given period?

EDIT: I forgot to mention, should I be looking for a high implied ERP via this method, which would imply that the stock is relatively low priced. If it beats the CAPM expected return [Risk free*(1-Beta)] shouldn't that be a good signal?

Are there any other metrics by which a comparison to this would be useful? For example, a reverse DCF valuation with conventional cost of equity / capital? I feel like I'm seeing a useful bit of information but can't put it into context.

t3_68rqg0,Why would a company borrow money to return a special dividend?,"The company I am currently looking at issued a special dividend half funded by cash on hand and other half through a loan at 2.2%. I understand the giving away cash they had on hand, but I don't get why they went ahead and borrowed a significant amount of LT debt to fund the dividend. Their total debt increased by 2.4x and LT debt increased by 3.5x. 

Management mentions that it made sense because they were not efficiently able to utilize their cash and they had a strong cash flow. I get this feeling that the move is to reward shareholders because they are able to generate strong cash flow to cover the debt (since the debt is at such a low rate as well), but how should one analyze this to make sure the move made sense in terms of metrics? Also (if this isn't the case), what other situations would justify this move?

The company is currently facing earnings growth issue due to federal policies and regulation so I am struggling to see how this is a good move in the eyes of someone who does not own any shares but want to purchases shares now.

t3_68xvlb,All the presidents friends: Political access and firm value,">Using novel data on White House visitors from 2009 through 2015, we find that corporate executives’ meetings with key policymakers are associated with positive abnormal stock returns. We also find evidence suggesting that following meetings with federal government officials, firms receive more government contracts and are more likely to receive regulatory relief (as measured by the tone of regulatory news). The investment of these firms also becomes less affected by political uncertainty after the meetings. Using the 2016 presidential election as a shock to political access, we find that firms with access to the Obama administration experience significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar firms. Overall, our results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value to corporations.

I looked up $GSAT and came up with these queries for the company, based on its January 2017 presentation. I tweeted the same to the co. but never heard back from them:

Slide #18:
1. How many satellites does your company have? Is it 24 (8 planes x 3 each?)
2. How many of these are 2nd generation satellites?

Slide #19:
3. 2nd generation satellites have a build out cost of $1bn. How long does it take for a custom, 2nd gen statellite to get built and delivered by manufacturer? How much does it cost to put the satellite into orbit, or is it already included in the cost?

Slide #3:
4. Globalstar completed a $1bn capex in 2013, yet has annual revenues of about $97mn only. It has ~0.7mn subscribers, and the ARPU average revenue per user comes to ~ $137. Does the company expect significant growth in subscriber numbers and ARPU, both?

Slide #6:
5. ""Company has already initiated proceedings in certain countries and by Q1 2017 will have initiated proceedings in countries representing a combined population of 375 million."" How soon does the company expect to obtain these approvals?

Please let me know if anyone is tracking GSAT, and what you think of my queries. Thanks.",3,0.72,1493922324.0

t3_6a0r3u,Investment industry career advice,"Hi all,

I would like to ask this subreddit for some career advice, for the investment industry. More like ""time allocation"" advice really. I realize perhaps this is not the place for it, but I  value the opinion of the community here. 

Getting more to the point... I would like to eventually work in (or start) a value investment firm. However, I am not sure whether I should focus on doing the CFA exams, or something else, such as just self-education in accounting (or a CPA?), value investing in general, and a lot of researching companies / reading filings. A big problem (in my view) is that I live in Canada and don't intend to move to the US or anywhere else. It seems that there are very very few value investment firms in Canada that follow the Ben Graham approach closely (I can only think of Francis Chou and Tim McElvaine's funds), and I would rather not have to work at a standard fund/bank with a heavy focus on sales as opposed to generating good returns for clients. 

Personally, although I greatly admire Buffett, I really prefer Walter Schloss' approach to investing. Although Schloss eventually obtained a CFA (when he was quite old I think?) , he was told to read Ben Graham's ""Security Analysis"" and that's all he'd need to know. Following a simple line of reasoning, I thought ""Well, maybe I should just work my way through that behemoth of a book. After all, Schloss did pretty well from it, in addition to his experience working with Ben Graham.""

A bit of background about me: I'm 24, econ background, working full time in an industry not related to investments. I've completed a few accounting courses. Tried studying for the CFA but was disappointed that analyzing securities is not really a majority of the material... got pretty bored tbh. 

Plan I'm leaning toward, going forward: work my way through ""Security Analysis"", research/read through a lot of filings and attempt to build up a good track record from investing my own funds. 

Is this a naive approach? Should I hammer through 900 hrs of studying for the CFA, just get CFA level 1, a CPA, or put those hours into investing my own funds? Any and all thoughts, however critical, are much appreciated. :)

t3_6a46td,Is value investing obsolete or are we just in shit times?,"Ok, so obviously value investing is still a great framework, etc. But how many of you guys have actually found good opportunities that fits within its loose definition? I mean really good ideas, not leveraged cases where the business is in an existential crisis?

Good companies with steady earnings are trading at very high multiples and growth stories are trading into the stratosphere.

We're almost a decade into the recovery of the last crisis, and the Fed hasn't moved the interest up much. So we've got pretty darn expensive markets and the eventuality of higher interest rates. Either that or we get another crisis emanating from Europe or China.

Is cash the answer? Maybe. 

So this is undoubtedly a difficult time to be a value investor in the traditional sense.You won't get too many good deals.

You can try to find a good opportunity that somebody else hasn't realized yet, i.e. a growth story, but that's extremely hard. Few of us are lucky to get those or smart enough to recognize them.

This isn't like the times of young Buffett when you found decent companies at a fraction of liquidation value.

Has investing become an unrewarding endeavor at this stage? 

I myself am heavily concentrated in 3 stocks, 2 of which are OTC. I consider them good companies and priced attractively. You don't need a lot of ideas, you only need 1, true. But it just feels like there's not too many great choices out there. Not too much gets me excited at the moment. 

Low rates, low economic growth, expensive market. If nothing happens, career investors suffer. If a crisis happens, new investors can do well, people with all their money in the market will suffer. If we get a sudden booth in growth, people on the fear train, who have suffered, will continue to suffer. That's all fine I guess, but it's not going to be easy for the majority of ""value investors"" to do well in the future is my guess. The game has gotten much harder. I'd say we're just in shit times for enterprising minds. Will value come back in vogue later on? Probably, but probably not in its original Grahamian form. The wait might take a damn long while though. TSLA and AMZN are not value investments. AAPL might have been, but the questions you have to ask are just so damn big. Not a traditional value investment but definitely of a similar vein.

Just a rant on my views. How do you guys all feel?

**Edit:** Also if I may add. Why the hell does anybody here give a damn about what Munger or even Buffett says? They're managing billions so they have a tiny opportunity set. They wouldn't have become the people they are today by following what they're doing today when they were younger. I respect them as well but their advice is irrelevant unless you're managing billions.

**Edit2:** I hope I'm not the only one on this reddit not managing billions.

**Edit3:** Thanks to the open debate on this thread along with some people sharing their recent ideas, I feel much more optimistic than I did when I began writing this post. I still feel discomfort operating in such an expensive market, but it's good to be reminded again that you only need a few good ideas to make money.",21,0.82,1494318911.0
t3_6aevsx,requesting advice for attending first shareholder meeting,"Hi guys,

I wanted to get some advice - I'm attending my first shareholder meeting during the first week of June. My employer (a wealthy family) is sending me on his behalf and would like me to ask some questions at the shareholder meeting. It is a company in liquidation (New York REIT).

I wanted to get some tips on how exactly these go down? I see in the proxy form that they will be voting on keeping the same auditor, as well as the board members, etc. That's pretty standard stuff.

At what point does Q&A come in? And do I need to bring anything with me to show that I'm going as a representative on behalf of my boss? Or can I just walk in, as long as I show them my license? I don't really care about the voting part, moreso about being able to ask questions.

My boss also wants me to try and meet with management team (mostly the new CEO who was just brought in) outside of the meeting. He probably owns a little over $1M of the stock (vs. $1.6B market cap), but based on the results of this meeting, I would have the authorization to buy a lot more. How would I go about setting this up? Is it as easy as just emailing IR and if I'm lucky, they'll agree?

If a company has no debt, then its ROE will be equal to its ROA.   The more leverage a company uses for growth, the more ROE rises above ROA.  If ROE and ROA both tell us something about internal versus sustainable growth rates relative to a company's current capital structure, is it possible that there is something useful about measuring a widening or narrowing spread of a company's ROE against its ROA?

t3_6c2ly7,Recommendation for a company on the basis of which I could do security research for educational / practice purposes,"Dear all,

I want to do a financial analysis on a company in order to determine if it is over/undervalued. I already do have quite some background knowledge given that I passed the first CFA exam and have an university education with a finance background. So while my fundamentals, what theory is regarded should be solid, I also want to test these in practice (also as a means to build up a bit of Excel infrastructure if I would value any other company in the future or in the context of an interview). 

What I would be asking for it you could recommend a publicly traded company, based in Europe, that is not a financial company, with well defined financial statements (so I can test all these ""juicy"" ratios we get to study for the analyst exams in one go), which is preferably already analysed somewhere on the internet (I would want to compare my results with the website) and finally which is preferably well defined in the sense of the industry it is operating in (thus it is not a multinational conglomerate of X different industries).

Thanks for any suggestions!",3,0.8,1495186556.0
t3_6cfxfu,Rights Issues - Why do these almost always elicit an unfavourable share price movement?,"Something I have noticed while studying my local stock market (Bursa Malaysia) is that by and large Rights Issues are viewed negatively by the market. On average, stock prices fall between 20-30% in the lead up to the ex-date, and often continue falling even after that. 

The biggest losers in this scenario are the minority shareholders, especially in the near term. 

It appears to be that based on my study, the only exception seems to occur when the rights issue is small in magnitude (1 rights for every 8 shares held) AND the company in question is in a high-growth phase. In almost every other case, the share price trends 20-30% lower in the build up to the ex-date. Then obviously as we all know on the ex-date the share price gets automatically corrected to reflect the dilatory impact of the enlarged share base.

Large shareholders usually do not get bothered by this price decline due to a number of factors - they can oversubscribe, leading to a much lower average price; they can't sell amidst the negative sentiment and depressed stock valuation; they're the founders and see long term value; they're GLICs wont to prop up GLCs and related companies. 

Is it fair to say that for most cases where a rights issue is concerned, investors are best served at selling out as soon as they hear about it, and then buy in when the valuations are depressed after the ex-date? Is this observation applicable worldwide, or is it something unique to the local Malaysian market? ",11,1.0,1495363436.0

t3_6d1mw1,Help understanding HD's balance sheet - shareholder equity,"Hello to the Security Analysis community! I could use some help understanding what's going on in Home Depot's balance sheet. I'm not a necessary a novice with equity analysis, but I'm certainly not an expert, and I would really appreciate some insight on what I'm describing below!


I was doing a quick research of the company's financials. I typically first like to review some key financial ratios, before diving into the financial statements. I like to see a low debt/equity ratio; I prefer to see 60% or less (although I'll admit that I don't fully understand why it's good for equity to be a good measuring stick against the company's debt...). I was astonished to see that HD has a debt-to-equity of something like 500%!!! So I looked at the balance sheet to better understand why that is, and the debt side of the equation looks OK compared to its assets, and not out of line with what I have seen on balance sheets of many strong companies... but shareholder equity has been tanking the last few years, which is what is driving the high D/E ratio.


Diving into the balance sheet:

-Total debt: 23.6B

-Equity:

    -Common stock: 88M

    -Additional paid-in capital: 9.7B

    -Retained earnings: 35.5B

    -Treasury stock - common: 40.2B

    -Total ""other equity"": 867M

    -Sum of equity: 88+9,700+35,500-40,200-867 = 4.2B


Total debt-to-equity: 561%


So the biggest drivers of equity above are retained earnings and treasury stock. Looking at the 5 year trends for each, treasury stock has grown at a much faster rate than retained earnings, which is what is causing the total equity to decline. My understanding is that treasury stock is essentially the value of the shares the company buys back, so this appears to be an intentional strategy by HD's management. Please correct me if my understanding about this is incorrect :)


I would like to better understand the big picture: Is it a bad thing for shareholder equity to remain low like this, especially since it is largely due to management's decision to buy back stock? If so, why would they choose to do this? I understand the general concept of shareholder equity, and more seems to be better, but I don't understand if it's a bad thing for HD to have low equity compared to its debt, etc, and if so, why. Also, more broadly, why is shareholder equity a good measuring stick against the company's debt?


Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Wondering how people here who manage separately managed accounts (SMAs) deal with allocating positions to new accounts.

Or is it better to maybe allocate less or maybe none if the position is closer to fair value? Having a hard time deciding on how to approach this and what is most fair for the client.

t3_6dbz1e,Financial Models for Spinoffs?,"Hi everyone,

I've been actively investing in special situations over the past year, with a large help from the information out of this subreddit.

My question is related to the utilization of financial models for understanding and evaluating special situation events, in particular, spinoffs. I've spoken to many of my peers who live and die by their Excel models, but it seems to me that a majority of them apply these models within a growth-oriented investment approach.

I've never used extensive Excel analysis when analyzing Greenblatt-esque stocks. Instead, I've tried to read extensively, take copious notes, and synthesize my own reports to guide my decisions.

Perhaps there's a different way to incorporate ""financial modeling"" to improve my process? Am I under-utilizing the modeling aspect?Would love to hear what people think.

t3_6duoyv,Accounting for M&A in DCF models,"Any DCF models I've worked on in the past have all been relatively straightforward, or where M&As were of minor significance to the bottom line, so I never really paid it much thought. When analysing a company having made a recent merger or acquisition, is there any particular way to account for the large differences it can make to the income statement?

For example, $WDC made their merger with SanDisk last year, and because of one time payments due to this, incurred 2 quarters of significant net losses, in a streak of otherwise positive quarters and growing revenue. In building the DCF model for $WDC, the 2 quarters of net loss would greatly impact the model, even though they only represented one time costs.

Is there any particular way these situations are handled in the construction of a model? Relatively new to model building so likely just being stupid. Thanks for any clarifications!",12,0.88,1495989260.0

To help with sub’s increased size, we’ve added /u/knowledgemule and /u/redcards as moderators. I'm sure they'll bring the same thoughtful approach to moderation that they have to their posts, questions, and comments over the years. 

While we hope the trend of subscriber growth continues, we’ll need everyone’s help to ensure the content and comment quality in this sub remains high. Here are some helpful hints on how to help us make that happen and how to get the most out of /r/SecurityAnalysis.

* **1.	Read the Sidebar and Use the Resources there**

Many subreddits don’t put much effort into their Sidebar, but Beren- has aggregated valuable resources that I have come to use regularly. Here are some resources that have been helpful for me:

**[Reading List](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/239qj8/updated_reading_list/)** – There are great books for learning about all aspects of Value Investing. The Reading List is separated by topic for ease of use and was updated in April 2014.

**[Beren’s Quarterly Investor Letter Posts]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=Letters+and+Reports+author%3ABeren%2A&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)** – Investor letters are a great way to get insight into how investors think about the strategy and tactics involved with managing their portfolios as well as the tactics they use to value companies. Beren- has been kind enough to compile a growing list of investment letters and reports from numerous investors. This resources allows you to compare and contrast approaches, investment styles, and investment theses from some of the best value investing portfolio managers.

**Financial Information** – [EDGAR](http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) and [SEDAR](http://www.sedar.com/search/search_en.htm). I read a lot of financial statements and I prefer to get them directly from the source. [SEC Live](http://www.seclive.com/) may be useful for those that find wading through EDGAR difficult. You miss out on information that companies are providing to the financial regulatory authorities if you only read 10-Ks and 10-Qs. In addition to other financial filings, also examine at press releases, earning call replays/transcripts, executive interviews, business articles, and books about companies/industries.

**[MBA Valuation Classes](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqfall15.htm)** – Damodaran’s classes are a great way to improve your Valuation skills. Lessons learned here become very powerful when combined with the unit economics of the businesses you examine. The Sidebar Links will remain updated when the new classes are posted.

**[Macabacus](http://macabacus.com/learn)** – Has many great financial models available to download for free. Examining the structure and formatting of these models will help you improve your financial modelling skills. I recommend that you combine these models with Damodaran's Corporate Finance & Valuation Classes.

**[Ben Graham Centre](http://www.bengrahaminvesting.ca/)** – This is the website for the Ivey Business School in Canada. They have a great value investing tradition and their website has links to Value Investing academic research, Videos of Guest Lecturers, and a host of other resources.

**[Value Investor’s Club](http://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/value2/)** – Contains stock pitches from value investors that tend to have a special situations angle. If you want to see what a good analysis of a stock looks like, sign up for a guest account here and read the highest rated ideas. Additionally, you can steal ideas from where Whitney Tilson and Joel Greenblatt steal ideas from. 

**Stock Exchanges** – Many countries don’t have an entity like EDGAR or SEDAR, but company financial information can be obtained directly from their resident stock exchanges. 

**[Whale Wisdom](http://whalewisdom.com/)** – Cloning is one of the sources for my ideas and every once in awhile I find a new fund that is worth tracking by browsing the posts there.



* **2.	Post interesting articles about Investment Search Strategy, Investment Analysis, Value Investing Philosophy, and Risk Management Techniques**

You'll find plenty of things to post if you read with an active mind. News, especially business news, should be read as events that people make happen rather than things happening randomly. Once you start asking why people are making these things happen, the news will become an examination of how companies respond to their competitors, how products evolve to meet the needs of customers, and how management creates or destroys value for shareholders. Each bit of news about a company or industry can be used as a building block to a case study in valuing companies. You can really see this when you look at [the Caesars situation referenced in point #3 and how it evolved over time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=caesars&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all). 


* **3.	If you’d like to have an open ended discussion of individual securities, your post must contain analysis**

Analysis is not a recitation of P/E ratios or growth rates. Analysis should mention how a company’s business, assets, earnings, industry, or other factors makes the security you’re discussing undervalued or overvalued. You can find examples of what NOT to post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3wxt72/thoughts_on_qualcomm_qcom/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3wybhr/thoughts_on_investing_in_brewdog/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3wydk3/anyone_a_little_nervous_about_under_armour_ua/), or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3wsz1z/starbucks_sbux/). If those examples don’t make it clear, posts probing for “Thoughts” while producing no analysis are actively discouraged.

For excellent examples of what to post, look at what [pershingcubed did here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3unxbv/morgans_hotel_group_mhgc_100_upside_from_current/), what [redcards did here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3s64tg/my_analysis_of_manning_napier_mn/), what [spyflo & team did here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3j2bc1/summer_equity_project/), or what [hedgefundaspirations did here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/30ef7s/heres_a_condensed_summary_of_my_research_on_arlp/). While these posts provide more extensive examples of analysis, posts looking to discuss individual securities need not be this thorough.
We desire to keep the discussion in this sub high level and want to prevent it from devolving into mindless chatter. **Your post will be deleted if it does not contain any analysis as baseless speculation helps no one.** It is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation. Please downvote posts that attempt to discuss individual securities with no analysis and we will remove them as soon as we can.

* **4.	Ask Specific Questions**

Asking specific questions fosters worthwhile discussion and thoughtful answers help people improve their investing skills. There are many knowledgeable people here that can answer questions. However, vague, unbounded questions require a lot of time to answer thoroughly and answers may completely miss the poster’s underlying intent. The “Thoughts” posts actively discouraged in point #2 exemplify this class of vague question.
/u/time2roll has done a pretty good job of [asking specific questions over the past couple years](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=author%3Atime2roll+flair%3Aquestion&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) and these specific questions tend to elicit great responses and discussion.

Keep up the great work.

* **5.	Give Specific Answers**

More people in the sub are asking very specific questions that are great prompts. Giving Specific Answers closes the loop and fosters quality discussion I hope continues to increase. /u/redcards has a great track record of providing [specific answers]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/5xybyh/teladoc_tdoc_short_thesis/deysmsz/?context=3) to question prompts.

**Please don’t attempt to answer questions if you don’t know the answer**. Once again, it is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation. Additionally, please don’t say anything if you don’t have anything helpful to say. There are some very knowledgeable people in this subreddit and I would love for their insights to be on display.

* **6.	Search /r/SecurityAnalysis**

Reddit’s search used to be horrible, but now it’s a lot better. Search is even more powerful when you specify link flair in your query as well. 
For example, if you were looking for all the [David Einhorn theses that were posted in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=einhorn+flair%3Athesis&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) or [all Warren Buffett Interviews posted in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=Buffett+flair%3Ainterview&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) you can find them by searching with link flair using the specified queries. Sometimes I follow situations that take a long time to resolve and I’ll post links here because they are interesting. For instance, I’ve followed Caesars’ recapitalization/spinoffs/bankruptcy for almost 3 years. I can review all of those posts by just searching for [Caesars](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/search?q=caesars&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all).

t3_6e98t7,Simulation: Bond ETFs in different rate environments - Result: below expected returns in inflationary environment.,"I've had some discussions over the past year with a number of users supporting the position that bond fund ETFs will return superior returns to holding to maturity despite the interest rate environment. Users have cited 

https://www.northerntrust.com/documents/commentary/investment-commentary/maturity-bond-funds-vs-individual-bonds.pdf

and

https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/ICRIBI.pdf

as documents supporting the idea that bond etfs will out perform the underlying assets in an inflationary interest rate environment. Given that both of the linked documents are marketing materials created in order to sell bond ETFs, I conducted due diligence in the form of a simulation. I based the ETF performance off of the marketing materials which indicated that the bond funds would sell old bonds on the secondary market and purchase new bonds in Q1 of each calendar year.

I would appreciate feedback on the model, I was surprised that my simulated ETF did not outperform holding to maturity (in terms of IRR) in any situation except a market crash (Scenario 5). (Have I misinterpreted how bond funds are cycling portfolios?, does the math not check out?)
This simulation supports my hypothesis that bond ETFs will be negatively impacted by changing interest rates; however, the result will not be as cataclysmic as I'd anticipated.

The attached excel should contain a drop-down menu to switch between simulations. If that is not present, than hardcoding B5 as {1:5} will allow switching between the simulations.

Because of that, I assume that this phenomenon is very uncommon, and would appear more in smaller, less efficient markets such as private equity.

The only reason I can think of as to why this would occur would be extreme asymmetrical information between the business seller and the buyer, and other qualitative factors which would result in the business owner selling for less than liquidation value. 


I also assume that when these situations occur, it would happen more with businesses in industries that are more heavily invested in their non-current assets. The low market price of their business would most likely be due to a bleak outlook for future profitability & growth, so then they ultimately sell the business for lower than its liquidation value.

I am a recent computing graduate who has gotten through to the second round of an equity analyst role. I have been asked to pitch a particular stock (Vianet plc), an AIM listed company. I have never done this before and did not want to make a fool of myself, so wanted to ask your advice on two main things: - 

1. Structure of presentation (Starting with stating my interest in a long position, industry overview, Company overview, valuation, closing statements)

2. Valuation - this part I am really struggling with. I understand the basic principles but there is just so much detail out there, I am not sure what will be most relevant/striking due to my lack of experience. 

The presentation is meant to be 5 - 10 minutes max, so I am unsure how detailed I have to be. 

I appreciate the confusion of my career choice with my lack of experience, but I would like to think I am quite commercially aware and feel that I can definitely make a good go of this space if I can get my technical abilities up to scratch.

t3_6fery3,Fundamental analysis books + DCF modeling,"Can anyone recommend me a practical fundamental analysis book that teaches actual methods for putting a quantitative valuation on a business? 

I've read many books recently but they all seem tied to teaching about temperament and mindset.

Here's what I've read recently:

The Intelligent Investor - It's one of the more quantitative books I've read but the actual methods are outdated. He mainly looks for good companies with strong balance sheets but i didn't see any part where he's putting target prices on the companies.

The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks

Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman

Beating the Street by Peter Lynch - mostly relative valuations and going to malls for research. I would like to hear his thoughts on that now since the advent of econmerce.

The Little Book that Still Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt - this one has some quantitative analysis in it but it's really too simplified and his ""magic formula"" seems like a ploy so people buying into Gotham's portfolio if you check their 13F

----

I've been looking into Aswath Damadoran since he seems to be one of the few that talks about the actual valuation method (DCF).  Do people recommend any specific books of his? I watched his Google talks and have been looking into The Little Book of Valuation. Are there any others?

Also, I've heard that Buffett says that you shouldn't be calculating it all down to 2+ decimals. He says he does it quickly in his head. It makes sense since he's looking at 1000's of companies and there should be a margin of safety.

Aswath seems to take it down to the deep end looking into WACC's, APV's, and making large excel sheets. 

I can't see Buffett making excel models for all of the companies he's sifting through since he doesn't even use a computer. Do you guess that he filters companies out with relative analysis then does a rough mental DCF model in his head from all his experience? 

Anyways, thanks in advance. I'm attempting to read a lot but I'm having some trouble consolidating everything into an actual practical method. I don't mind number crunching a spreadsheet but it seems unreasonable to do it for every 10K you're reading. I guess I answered my own question.

t3_6figq1,Finding Investment Ideas,"Hey guys,

I was wondering what you all think is the best way to create a list of potential investments, before narrowing down and going through each one (reading the annual report, financial statements, etc.) I've found screeners to often be biased and un-helpful. One approach would just be to create a list of industry stocks (Tech, retail, pharma, etc.) and evaluate each one. That way the research is unbiased and the resulting conclusion can be either long/short.

So far I think that focusing on a sector and sub-sector like semiconductors, enterprise software, etc. following the general industry and looking at the individual companies would be the most effective way. Often times, when I start reading the annual report of a company I find that there is a lot of industry background to catch up on, and focusing on one industry would be a better and more efficient use of time. However, on the flip side, opportunities in a sector may not always exist and being to specific can eliminate potentially valuable investment ideas. 

How do you guys find candidates to do further research on?

I've also been reading a lot of the reports by Citron and was wondering how funds/research groups focused specifically on short selling would look for candidates.

t3_6g79sx,There are 5 or 6 Canadian cannabis companies worth buying right now. Emerald Health trades the farthest below intrinsic value and is the only one that easily has 500-1500% w/ significant margin of safety based on present value of future cash flows.,"I wrote it all on my website with better formatting but here are my thoughts on the most recent joint venture announcement by Emerald Health, a licensed producer of cannabis in Canada. This $120 million market cap cannabis licensed producer now has the ability to net $40 million or more annually by 2019 (legalisation occurs Summer 2018). Emerald is both undervalued relative to intrinsic value and relative to peers. The industry economics are starting to unfold around the cannabis industry and it looks like there is a strong possibility of high FCF, high margins, price regulation (good for commodity), supply lagging demand for years (huge plus for investment merit), low reinvestment requirement and a few other major qualitative and quantitative variables that could lead to above average valuations as well but even at low-end estimates for net income there is still massive profit potential in Emerald.   
  
I have a ton more info about the sector at felkerinvesting.com if you want some good primers on the industry, I keep an updated spreadsheet of the 12 bigger licensed producers as well with all of their current and planned production numbers and some metrics used to show relative value. I currently think there is investment merit in Aurora, Hydropothecary, Organigram, Aphria and Emerald. My allocations are on my site but i think theres a strong argument for Emerald trading significantly below its intrinsic value and the best value of its peer group, id be very surprised if this doesnt 10x over the next 5 years (the small peer group with investment merit, most of those licensed producers are smoke and mirrors and promises).  
  
This is the fastball that Buffett says to swing at. Its being legalised, the industry economics are easy to understand and more importantly, there are a variety of qualitative and quantitative variables that could lead to very positive investment merit and  above average valuations due to some legislative and industry factors. A brand new industry does not pop out of the ground every year, there are still some high quality companies that are significantly underpriced right now because cash flows from legalisation are a year away and because its such a small inefficient market (banks cant own this, its not legal yet and the companies are all 100-200m (minus the big 2) and arnt on anyones radar + there was a downturn).  
  
Please trust me. Just do your own DD and read my primers and other thoughts on the industry, this is the only 300-500% youre going to see in 3-5 years and theres still a few companies that can 10x. Plus its still an extremely infant industry with a ton of room for growth as stigmas fade and the medicinal uses are more commonly known; there are non-psychoactive (dont get you high) ways to use cannabis in 1 drop of tasteless oil every day that will challenge billions in medicinal revenue.

http://www.felkerinvesting.com/2017/06/emerald-health-therapeutics-emc-and.html  

Earlier this week we saw a game-changing move in the cannabis industry with Emerald Health Therapeutics ($EMH) entering into a joint venture with Village Farms ($VFF), a North American produce-growing company with 4.8 million sq ft of greenhouses in British Columbia, 30 years of operational experience and 750 years of combined ""master grower"" experience. In the joint venture, Emerald Health will pay $20 million (in tranches) for a 50% stake in the JV that will lease (with the option to buy) 1.1 million sq ft. of existing greenhouse and the option to lease or purchase an additional 3.7 million sq ft. of existing greenhouses owned by Village Farms (for 4.8 million sq ft total). The 1.1 million sq ft. greenhouse is projected for 75,000,000 grams annually and the 4.8 million sq ft. of total greenhouse space should yield over 300,000,000 grams. This puts Emerald Health at the best relative value in the industry by a large margin and also provides the largest margin of safety relative to intrinsic value.  
  
This joint venture with Village Farms might be the best acquisition/partnership that we have seen in the industry so far. At $20 million for 50% of the JV-owned 1.1 million sq ft. and 75,000,000 grams annually, Emerald paid $36/sq ft. (1.1 mil / 2 = 550,000 sq ft. ; $20,000,000 / 550,000 sq ft) and $0.53/gram of annual production ($20,000,000 / 37,500,000 grams); this is comparable to Aphrias' greenhouse construction cost of $50/sq ft. and $0.66/gram of annual production, or to $250/sq ft. and $2.56/gram of annual production for Auroras' acquisition cost for Peleton Pharma (for acquisitions, there are comparable numbers in my article on the Mettrum acquisition HERE); it is even comparable to Emeralds' cost for their existing greenhouse that was projected to cost $10,000,000 per 10,000,000 grams of production. The cost for the retrofit of the greenhouse could exceed $20 million but it would have to double/triple before it becomes overpriced relative to other industry acquisitions/partnerships. The JV deal is also to be paid in tranches with only $2 million up front and $18 million to be paid out as milestones are reached, this saves Emerald on the back end if the deal falls through or isn't finished according to plan. Most importantly, in my opinion, is that Emerald just paid $20,000,000 for 37,500,000 grams of annual production, which should end up producing $30,000,000-40,000,000 net, annually.  
  
Emerald will still need to retrofit the existing greenhouses for cannabis production, which according to Village Farms most recent investor presentation, should initiate the cultivation license process in June 2017, the greenhouse conversion process in Summer 2017 (completing March 2018), and the growing process in late 2018. It seems that an in-process tomato crop in the current greenhouse is delaying the process (tomato crop completed Nov 2017) but even with growing starting late 2018, I'm still optimistic. We obviously want production as soon as possible but this is an eternal industry with a lot of variables still left to play out, a 6 month delay from legalization does not ruin the investment merit of this company and the point still stands that they are priced at close to 2-3x net income for 2019 (without the addition 3.7 million sq ft from the JV and further expansion on their own facility). Emerald also has 10,000,000 grams planned for production by legalization from their current facility in British Columbia and up to 100,000,000 grams if the full footprint is built out.  
  
A quick look at market caps and production across the sector show relative value for Emerald.  
  
Market values, planned production, and price per gram of production as of June 8, 2017  
Aurora - $680 million - 99.8 million grams - $6.5 per gram of production  
Canopy - $1.25 billion - 92 million grams - $13.5 per gram of production  
Aphria - $720 million - 75 million grams - $9.5 per gram of production  
Organigram - $230 million - 26 million grams - $9 per gram of production  
Hydropothecary - $150 million - 29 million grams - $5.1 per gram of production  
**Emerald - $120 million - 47.5 million grams - $2.5 per gram of production**  
  
Price per gram of production is a metric that I created to show relative value between companies, based on their planned production relative to their market capitalization. Obviously some companies will deserve a better premium over others based on management, ancillary services, location, competitive advantage, etc.   
  
We see here that Emerald is priced at almost 1/2 of Organigram while producing almost 2x more product. Emerald is also 17.5% the size of Aurora but is slated to produce 50% as much product, if Emerald was priced the same as Aurora (in terms of price per gram of planned production) it would be worth $308,750,000, obviously Aurora is going to be worth more per gram of production because they have a different management, different financing, different location, different medicinal patients, etc. but Emerald still has incredible value when looking at relative industry valuations and valuation relative to net income.  
  
For a better relative valuation, Aphria has 75,000,000 grams projected from their 1,000,000 sq ft. greenhouse completing construction in July-August 2018 (growing starting just before or around the same time as Emerald); Emerald is projecting 47,500,000 grams annually (67% of Aphria production) and is priced at 17% of Aphria. Both of these companies use greenhouses and both are low-cost producers.  
  
When looking at future potential production, Emerald has a maximum capacity now of 250,000,000 grams annually (at low-end production estimates, more than any other LP) which could net $250,000,000 annually (2x its current market cap). Aurora maximum production is 150,000,000 (50,000,000 of which is dependent on a facility that hasn't been started and is only in the planning/zoning stage, we also haven't heard about the additional facility in quite a few months), Canopy maximum production is 130,000,000 grams (with construction on a large portion of this incomplete/unstarted), this leaves Emerald with the largest potential production for the industry, by far. This is also extremely beneficial for Emerald because, unlike almost ever other LP, these production numbers are backed by actual completed greenhouses (retrofitting is still required, but doesn't require full bottom-up construction and planning like most other LPs). My biggest issue with this industry (and the reason I created this spreadsheet) is that the majority of the LPs have planned so much but have so little construction actually underway, Emerald benefits here by not having to plan and construct new facilities from the ground up.  
  
Village Farms is located in one of the best climates in Canada for greenhouses, the coldest temperatures during the winter tend to stay above 0 degrees Celsius which should help with heating costs. Aurora, for example, experiences a ""real"" winter that will require higher heating costs that will cut into COGS during the winter months. Village Farms also owns a 7 MW power plant that is fueled by recycling landfill gas, it is unsure if this is going to be used for the JV.  
  
Emerald Health also provides the highest margin of safety relative to intrinsic value out of any LP that I follow. Margin of safety is also most apparent for Emerald in the case of a production limit (something that is very possible in the future once supply overtakes demand); Aurora also provides a strong margin of safety in this case, not because of margin of safety relative to IV but because they own a supply chain in Germany that could take excess product that might not be allowed in Canada.  
  
Risks  
  
Emerald (and Village Farms) will still have to raise additional capital to build out the first facility and to retrofit the additional 3.7 million sq ft., this will lead to dilution. I dont have much of a disdain for necessary dilution (especially dilution that pays for itself 2x over within its first year or two of production).  
  
There is risk of the retrofit being more costly than planned or lagging the proposed timeline. Although extra costs are possible (probable?), lagging the timeline is less possible because the $20 million funding from EMH is in tranches to be paid out based on completing milestones.  
  
I would also like to know the leasing agreement for the facility and whether the power plant will be used to subsidize power costs. I would also like to see the costs for acquiring the additional facilities.  
  
I am interested in how the 50% ownership will work for Village Farms, will they sell the product to Emerald? Will they receive their own cultivation/sales license and sell their 50% of production themselves? What prices will they be charging Emerald, if Emerald buys their product, or will they sell it to competing LPs? Are all profits from EMH sales from the facilities split in 50%? Will the JV sell under their own label, with 50% of profits funneling to each partner? Sell under Emerald, with 50% of profits going to each partner? Village Farms is definitely undervalued now, but there are so many questions when trying to determine just how undervalued they are.  
  
It also seems like these acquired greenhouses are not as automated as the Aphria/Aurora greenhouses (although labeled ""state of the art"" in their investor presentation). Are these facilities going to have a long life? Is there significant capital spending required in the future for upkeep? Are the facilities going to produce significantly less per square foot as the automated facilities (projections are below-average but estimates are said to be conservative)?  
  
Price Targets  
  
Im writing an article on price targets across the industry so I wont go into extreme detail here. This is an extremely simplified price target and in no way represents my analysis on the industry, this company or this JV; this is a quick calculation based on net income for the growth phase on an industry that could very well end up completely different based on how various qualitative/quantitative variables play out.
  
In 2018, Emerald should net $0-10 million depending on how revenues play out from their 10,000,000 gram/100,000 sq ft. facility that is supposed to be finished by legalization. Emerald could net $40-50 million annually from this JV and their facilities combined for 2019 (depending on spending and operations; net incomes should be low for initial phases of legalization due to required spending for expansion). Emerald also has the opportunity to obtain the rest of the 4.8 million sq ft. available, which could push them over $150 million net (47.5 million current + 150 million if all 4.8 million sq ft. is utilized, minus margin of safety; also not including the rest of the 32 acres that Emerald owns that could add another 90 million grams annually if built out).  
  
If this joint venture doesn't hit any major roadblocks, Emerald should be worth well over $800,000,000 by 2019. $800,000,000 represents a 20 PE on $40,000,000 (less than $1/net on 47.5 million grams, a low end projection w/ margin of safety), this disregards any additional expansion on their own 1.4 million sq ft. property or the acquisition of the 3.7 million sq ft. that Village Farms has remaining in the JV contract. I also believe that valuations for this industry could be higher than average because of a variety of reasons that I've listed HERE in my analysis on the industry.  
  
I believe that Emerald now has the best potential to be the largest licensed producer in Canada, based on all current information. It is not crazy to think that Emerald could be worth $1.5-3 billion down the road if there is a market for the 300 million grams that the JV could potentially produce across its 4.8 million sq ft. of greenhouses, plus there is the 1.4 million sq ft. of land that Emerald leases in BC (from the CEO).

while reading 10-k's, i seem to see a lot of companies that talk about their annual intangible impairment tests, and they seem to reduce the discount rate they use in their intangible asset impairment tests year over year. 

i know that goodwill can be manipulated quite easily by management teams, but i'm curious... how do management teams determine the discount rate in their goodwill impairment tests? 

do management teams kind of pull it out of their ass? if assets are being valued by discount rates, and they can change them after acquisitions, are they effectively moving their goal posts to avoid goodwill amortization hits on the income statement? 

i realize that goodwill doesn't often reflect economic realities, but i'm looking at this as an indicator of management teams financially engineering their results.

I'll go first:

His name is Pat Dorsey. He used to be the director of Morning Star and helped implement their moat philosophy. He has a great book for beginners called [""The Little Book That Builds Wealth""](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-That-Builds-Wealth/dp/047022651X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1499448984&sr=8-2&keywords=pat+dorsey) and another one that is a little more advanced and goes into how to value different sectors. That book is called [""The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing""](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Rules-Successful-Stock-Investing/dp/0471686174/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499448984&sr=8-1&keywords=pat+dorsey). I own both and of the 70-odd business / investing books I've read, those are some of the only ones I've read more than once. 

*Note: I don't get a dime from you buying those books off Amazon, I just highly recommend them.*

If reading really isn't your thing, then he has some videos on youtube that I believe are worth watching:

[Here's a quick 5 minute summary of moats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptIGzhgIE3o)

[Google Talk is probably the most beginner friendly of his lectures](https://youtu.be/YFS5JBgz1Xc)

[Texas Lutheran University is the same stack as the Google Talk, but it's about twice as long and a tiny bit more advanced from what I remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbEfjHrwK8c)

[YIS is a more recent interview he gave with some college students.](https://youtu.be/zZ5rgAI-bJQ)

[Then here is his most recent lecture on the internet. It's only 30 min long if youre looking for a condensed version of the above lectures.](https://youtu.be/1f8t3E3WcN4)

Here's his [site](http://dorseyasset.com/publications-commentary/) where you can find his presentation stacks and a couple interviews. He used to have his Berkshire Hathaway investors conference commentary up, but I guess he took it down. 

When I posted one of these videos last week, someone told me that a lot of Dorsey's methodology can be replicated by a computer using Python. So, I've been dusting off my Python skills to see where that leads me.

t3_6m8h3s,Most efficient book to prepare for a high finance career?,"From a purely technical/financial perspective, what book is the most efficient (applicable knowledge/non-applicable knowledge) for preparing for IB, HFs, and PE (and their interviews)? I know a lot of this stuff is learned on the job, but it would be great to at least try to learn this stuff from a book.

I have been looking at Damodaran's *Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset* but it seems to go into more detail than I really want. I have also looked at the Rosenbaum book, but it does not spend as much time on Merger Models as I would like.

If I am concerned with M&A, Merger Models, Treasury Stock Method, FCFF, EV/EBITDA (and other multiples), Operating Models, DCFs, etc., what is the most efficient way to master this stuff? (and to understand it beyond surface level)

Yet in other of his annual letters he discusses intrinsic valuation using discounted cash flows.  There were 50 years of letters and I can't recall precisely if he says that's what he used or if he was just making a general point about coming to your own judgment about value, and citing the technique of his mentor Ben Graham as an example.  If Buffett indeed uses discounted cash flows in stock picking, how would he compute cost of equity if he doesn't believe in beta?  Would he just use 1 because his preferred alternative investment is an index fund?",13,0.81,1499647679.0

t3_6mju4s,MET: Life Insurance valuation a hopeless cause?,"Dipping my toes into MET in advance of BHL's upcoming spin-off and I gotta say, financial companies -- especially life insurance -- seem too intractable to pin down.

My understanding so far is that it all comes down to signing policies, effectively managing the risk borne by those same policies, and receiving moderate returns on the available float. Since the 08-ish crisis, regulatory requirements have become more stringent, further increasing coverage demands. The spin-off of BHL seems like an effort by MET to avoid uncertainty surrounding pending regulatory requirement changes that could be coming down the pike for life insurance (LH). That, and given Property Casualty (PC) insurance has a different set of dynamics, it appears MET would prefer to focus its efforts on a single front rather than chase a second rabbit.

But goodness... Made some charts and lots of notes, but it still seems awfully opaque. It's all one giant theoretical probability orgy complete with ""conditional tail expectations"", asset rating categories, and a bunch of other similarly worthless calculations. I assume peers are roughly the same on this matter, I doubt there's much variance in the sense that competitors each run similar actuarial tables. For example, no executive team in their right mind would willingly assume a ton of tail risk just to be different from the pack, PLUS! the regulatory requirements and looking-over-their-shoulder ratings agencies strongly encourage a sort of conformity.

Practically speaking, insurance can increase/reduce risk through new policy initiatives, and I imagine that takes some time to cycle through to new customers in a material way. So it's a slow moving industry in that sense just by the law of numbers. Which means cost cutting cost cutting cost cutting is the main lever management can pull. Either that or fundamentally altering its in-force policy contracts by restructuring its business in the form of say, you guessed it, a spin-off.

However, I'm tempted to toss this squarely in the ""too difficult"" bin. There seems to be so many nooks and crannies to tuck away poor performance.

Thoughts? Are permanently higher profit margins here to stay? Or as I suspect, will a more normalized interest rate environment drive this down? Since 1980, we have been in a declining interest rate. What does the world look like when the opposite happens? What is the catalyst for this?

t3_6myzyk,Strong moats = monopolies,"Many investors go the ""Buffett"" route and look for companies with large moats - a durable competitive advantage.

I recently read Peter Thiel's book ""Zero to One"" and he talks thoroughly about how he looks for startups with monopolistic-like characteristics. He categorizes businesses in a spectrum from ""perfect competition"" to ""monopolies"". Perfect competition being where there are tons of players in the industry and they essentially compete away all the profits (ie; restaurants, t-shirt shops, groceries, etc.) and monopolies which are self-explanatory.

This got me thinking that companies with strong moats are essentially just monopolies since they do not allow competition from chipping away their profits.

If you are looking at companies with strong moats, those companies will essentially always be the top players in their industry. They will typically have the higher ROE, profit margin, revenues/earnings, etc. than their competitors. This inevitably happens since they have a stranglehold on the market share. Think Google as a search engine, Microsoft as an OS, Apple as a smart phone provider, Coke as the leading soft drink, Amazon as the ecommerce hub, etc.

The cash flows of monopolies are essentially a certainty and calculating a PV on their future cash flows seems like it would be a cinch. Would it not be best to invest in these companies once the price is somewhat reasonable no matter what? It might take years for that opportunity to happen, but why wouldn't this be a simple and profitable methodology to follow?",27,0.88,1499915627.0
t3_6nfyrl,Can you teach investing? - A Thought Experiment.,"Hi everyone

Lately I've been thinking about how to become a better investor. Whether it's teachable and replicable. And so on.  

So I hope you'll try this thought experiment: 

- An investor you have solid respect for (say: Seth Klarman or Joel Greenblatt or whoever) offers to teach you one on one. 
- He will charge you $5000 for a week, but he is busy so you'll have to come up with the curriculum yourself.
- You will have to keep it a secret, so you can't brag about the experience later.

Question 1: Are you a buyer?

Question 2: If yes, what would you ask him to teach?


Thanks for playing  :)

P.S.: I added the money element to get you to not just mindlessly say yes just because you want to hang out with a superstar. Approach it rationally: would a weeks worth of teaching really be WORTH that money to you?

They are facing cash crunch due to lower copper prices and high leverage. There's definitely value there, but I am not sure if the assets will get taken away from equity owners due to restructuring.

The Canadian SEDAR system is similar to US EDGAR system. From SEDAR, I could find the following:

1. The ownership of N Murray Edwards across debt (junior credit facility, senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures) and equity (37%) since he's treated as related party.

2. From proxy statement: Convertible debentures are also held by Fairholme



The question that I haven't been able to figure out:

How much of the senior unsecured notes are owned by Fairholme? More generally, how to find who owns debt securities from the filings? Specifically, for Fairhome and unsecured notes, I don't see any disclosures on this in the annual report or Proxy.

t3_6nmgjb,Calculating portfolio returns - Need help to confirm if I am doing it correctly on Excel,"Generally, I get it that there are two ways to calculate returns. 

1) (End value - Start value)/(End value)

2) Using IRR calculation

The first method is simple enough, but will likely understate returns if you are buying new stocks and adding to your positions throughout the year (especially if this is the first year you're investing). 

The second method (for now) seems bad as well cause it is overstating my portfolio returns, but will likely normalize once I can get a full year to analyze. 

Anyways, for the second IRR method, I use the XIRR Excel formula. I just want to know if I am doing it correctly or not. In particular, with regards to the dividend. None of my stocks are set to auto reinvest. The dividend go back into my bank account, and I use it to buy more stocks in the future.

t3_6oqb1d,"Department store apocalypse investment idea, own their real estate, or buy the firm?","Hi, I'm considering buying real estate tenanted by public companies in the department store sector. I've been drawn to investments in the retail space because there are companies trading well below historical price/book value, the retail apocalypse may price some companies post-bankruptcy, where bankruptcy may not be so certain, potentially revealing opportunities for margin of safety.
Also, in both cases I have an opportunity to invest in real estate with these companies are the tenant.
So, I would like to be able to compare an investment in real estate occupied by these companies, bonds, and common stock.

For Bon-Ton. In 2007 a private equity firm bought the company and loaded it with debt, it has not found much profitability during this history. The stock price peaked at $56 in 2007, on high hopes that the private equity firm will earn money for shareholders.  The recession hit, and in 2008 the stock was trading for $1.19, then reached $18 in 2010, $3 in 2011, $21 in 2013, and now trading as low at $0.73. The high volatility is due to the speculative capital structure (high debt, little equity). 
The gross margins are stable at 37%, but high SG&A have led to its first operating loss in the TTM since 2009. Operating margins have been historically low since 2012 and dramatically dropped below 2% to 0.35% in 2016. The company has a heavy debt burden, as mentioned, about $70m a year in payments, much of their debt from 2007 has been paid off, but due to current operating losses this debt is rising. The company's cash on hand is about $7m, which is flat since 2013, a sign of capable cash management. Capital lease obligations have risen since 2016 from 45m to 127m. Debt is currently approximately equal to the company's assets, leaving a negative equity position. I researched that corporate bonds are currently trading at 40% of par with an 8 coupon rate, yield to maturity of about 37%. Current net losses are $57m (2016) $63m (2017) and $83m (TTM). The company has expanded by purchasing property, plant, equipment of about $50m per year. There is no stock repurchases.
Insider ownership has risen from 15% in 2014 to 25% in 2017. Is that signs of optimism in the common stock?

This company, along with many other retailers have dealt with declining Q4 revenues, current top line revenues have dropped to 2009 revenues (2015 & 2016). While it is likely that we are in a weak spending cycle (approximately once every 7-10 years going back to 1995). It is said that they have a 25% of defaulting on debt over the next 12 months. We need to know whether the company's balance sheet can survive another 2-3 years of negative earnings, or not. Can the company aggressively sell off assets to pay down debt while keeping locations open that are capable of the debt service plus profits? Did their untimely expansion in 2007 cause them to a ultimate bankruptcy, or will this company work out? And, given these unknowns, what is a fair price to pay for the common stock. How cheap is cheap enough? The stock traded as low as a $6m market cap last week, and is currently around $17m in market cap, in 2007 the market cap was over $1 billion, and over $400m in 2013.
Will the debtors force bankrupty, or continue to provide financing.
Is the current down turn a permanent shift due to Amazon, is America in a retail specific recession, are the recent retail closures/bankruptcy affecting the foot traffic of other retailers (yes), or is there a combination of negative factors causing operating (probably).
If the common stock makes sense, at what price, in market cap? $20m, $10m, $5m, $0m?

And then there is the real estate. I have a property under contract, tenanted by BonTon. It pays about $350,000 per year in net income (NNN lease), with a lease until end of 2021 (about 4 years left), guaranteed income of about $1,400,000 in 4 years.
Vacant, the building would be worth maybe $400,000. With a 10-year lease, it could be worth over $4,000,000. I would personally try to acquire the property for about $1,000,000 - $2,000,000, with a mortgage loan on the property.

**Where on the capital structure do I want to be?** Stocks, bonds, real estate.

Do I want to buy the real estate, fee-simple with a lease by a company close to bankruptcy? I should know whether my lease get paid in full despite a bankruptcy proceeding? There is a corporate guarantee on the lease, but how do I know exactly if I the terms will hold up in bankruptcy. 
If I buy the real estate, I think I can assume a 17-20% cash flow return (unleveraged), leveraged with 50% would drop cash flow to $300,000 but increase cash on cash to about 40%/year for 4 years.

For starters, I think we can remove the corporate bond route, because that only has a chance of being redeemed at par, with little speculative advantage afterwards, a nice return, but I can accomplish this the same with the real estate, and bonds are paid after real estate leases, I believe, plus at the end of the lease term I am left with an asset. 
In comparison to common stock, it is not as obvious.
For the price I pay for 1 piece of real estate ($2,000,000 earning 17% return), I could buy 10% of the entire company. That includes operation of over 250 stores.

My mind started to take me in thoughts about how to do both real estate and get exposure to the speculative upside of the company if it were to survive.

For comparable analysis, Gordman's (a bankrupt competing department store retailer) was recently bought for $75,000,000, in cash, by Stage Stores, very low debt in this deal (as well as Stage Stores). Gordman's enterprise value ([according to gurufocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/financials/GMANQ) was $77m as of the 2016 bankruptcy))
Gordman's had higher gross margins than Bonton and Stage Stores (41%) and couldn't keep SG&A costs down during periods of declining revenue. These operating losses were not financed by more debt, although $44m was taken out in 2014

The market cap of Gordman's was about close to par of the Enterprise value, until 2014 where market cap began to decline down to about 50% of Enterprise Value. The liquidation price, already noted, was for approximately the enterprise value. Debt at the time was about $30m.
More successful retailers like Kohls and Dillards are trading for about 60-80% of book value right now, while losers Sears and JCP are selling at about 20-25% of book value. 

What do you think about Bonton, at 1.4% of Book Value! A fair chance of default ~25%, inventories about equal to long term debt.
Or Stage Stores at 21% of Book Value, but with NO chance of default, Current Assets greater than Total Liabilities, plus they are making acquisitions.

And considering I could own the real estate of Bonton for the price of 10% of the entire company, how should I look at this situation in the most profitable, least risky way.  Could I somehow leverage the real estate and make a hedge using the common stock's upside (given its highly speculative pricing, the little equity present will be volatile).

what I don't get is why is the market valuing it so far away from book value/market value? the only thing I can think of is the extremely illiquid nature of the security because of its minute capitalization.

anything else I may be missing? even if the sale goes through slightly less than what management thinks they should get (what they carry the property on the books) there is still so much net assets left over that you have a generous amount of ""room for error""

t3_6qs30p,"The End of Coca Cola, P&G and the traditional business model","Going to be stepping on some holy grounds here so please hold the crucifix for now. 

One of the things I got to thinking over the past several years was about whether the business model we have seen Buffet and other investors invest in continue to make sense or not. I know this sound crazy but hear me out. We all know the story of Coca Cola, the low price, inelastic, semi-addictive product then converted into large global distribution base and brand portfolio. The story of the company for the past 40 years was about building out this massive global distribution footprint to the point where it was easier to find a bottle of coke in some rural Indian village than a bottle of water. But there are some problems to this model, primarily that A) You can't really find another 1-2 billion consumers now B) It is hard to capture consumer surplus (price segregation is impossible and C) it is hard to capture increasing share of the consumer wallet as living standards improve. (people will cap out on how much product to drink a day). 

And I got to think about the problem with mass distribution or infrastructure models, usually the core is highly profitable and end up subsidizing the hinterlands, the last mile country road to a small town is a very unprofitable investment. In my mind, this is also a problems existing CPG companies face, the last customers is hard to reach, expensive to acquire, at some point it is much better to increase wallet share and/or capture the consumer surplus of your core base of customers. This is why targeted ads are changing marketing so much, as it allows companies to price segregate by customers (different tier of a similar product) and big data is so valuable (increasing wallet share). 

I wonder if the time for traditional companies that relies on the formula of building out distribution, acquire/develop a bunch of products and push through your channels is over. The rise of third party infrastructure rails like Amazon and facebook for distribution and customer aggregation also has removed the needs for doing that yourself. I feel the economic laws revolving around specialization will push companies to being more product oriented and focused on capturing consumer surpluses through niche products. The obvious play is that the infrastructure rails will capture a large part of the economics, but who knows if big scaled brands even exist 10-20 years down the line?

i investigate companies full-time, and im hoping that we can get some other individuals that do this full-time too. 

if you are interested, PM me and i will gauge interest and send out invites to the channel.

thanks!

A lower valuation might only be enough to pay the seniors and the subs would receive nothing. If the equity were valued at a lower value then the seniors would receive x amount of new debt + 100% of the equity. If the new debt + equity is less than their prepetition claims, but they are able to sell the new entity for a higher amount than the valuation, they keep the windfall profit. I get it on a broad level but am having difficulty with understanding why the senior debt holders would want a lower valuation, when a higher valuation would price in the windfall profit that they could receive.

t3_6rllin,FL and GME (Foot locker + gamestop) -- Dying or undervalued?,"I've been giving these companies a lot of thought for several weeks now, and both appear to be deep value opportunities on the surface. Foot locker has been steadily increasing YoY earnings, pays a 2.6 div which it fully supports with its cash position, has favorable earnings multiples, etc. but is the fear of its extinction warranted, or pushing the stock to a fantastic buy level? The main fear here is obviously online retail competing away brick and mortar (namely amazon, specifically its deal with Nike), but I am wondering if there is something to be said for shoes as a specialty retailer who actually often requires a brick and mortar visit. Will there always be those who like to try on their shoes, or line up around the block for the biggest release? Or will those trends be eaten up by online consumption in due time. Gamestop similar story. Beautiful picture surrounding the numbers of the stock, 7% dividend supported by balance sheet, fairly flat growth, but selling at a low 6X earnings multiple, and the store itself is very cyclical when you talk to its clientele and staff. Big console releases can make or break earnings, and the current console generation is 5 years in, leaving us ripe for some releases that drive up same store sales. To me this implies that its sunk to a low multiple on disappointing growth, but a rebound remains possible, meanwhile the dividend is attractive enough to adequately compensate for the risk. The 2 encroachers here are Amazon again, and the ease of buying things online -- will we all be doing it in a few years, regardless of release hype, or the easy used game business. More directly, Gamestop is threatened by the increasing prevalence of digital releases, undermining the need to even order a game in the mail, let alone step out to buy it.

t3_6tnrm7,That Four-Letter Word - MOAT,"Recent post I made...feed back welcome

This is a mental post that I have been hesitant to write. Fortunately, reader count is low and the second half of the year ain’t lookin’ much better, contrary to what most public co’s are saying. So, I’m safe.

A fund manager recently asked me how I would assess an investment write-up and analyst in a hiring process. I tend to tread lightly around these topics in an effort to not simplify the complex. But, I said this. Be wary of that four-letter word: MOAT! Of course, the term “moat” is a metaphor/visual coined (?) and made popular by Warren Buffett when describing businesses capable of defending their turf (i.e., market position and profits) against capitalist invaders!



Joking aside, over the past few years, I have tried to scrub the word “moat” from my vocabulary. And, when asked, I try to encourage others to do the same. At my prior buy-side gig, I wrote a lot. I mean a lot. And, it wasn’t easy recaps of earnings, news, and conference calls rather it needed to be my own original thoughts and conclusions. While daunting at first, it quickly became the good kind of pain that precedes growth and strength. Human nature did tempt me to take short cuts though. Instead of the painstaking, tedious, and uncertain task of thinking through something and shaping an opinion supported by that understanding, I could mix in a little moat talk and be done with it. Everyone reading understood and revered moats and knew that’s what we were after.

It goes something like this: These economics are remarkable for a distributor and, I believe sustainable on account of a durable economic moat in an attractive market. Okay, in certain forms and contexts, this is fine and it may well be good and true. But, if what you’re after is an actual fundamental understanding and the conviction that goes along with that, the above is useless.

I’ve heard the concept of moats thrown around as mental model. Whether a proper mental model or just a helpful visual, my concern starting a few years ago was that a “moat” represented something far more complex. Was pulling the word “moat” and the familiar concepts around it (e.g., switching costs, network effects, etc.) simply my lazy mind taking shortcuts and avoiding the extra (Kahneman’s System 2) effort?  Was I susceptible to falsely believing that a treacherous moat exists because everyone inside the castle told me so and we had been safe for so long? Or were we just lucky that no invaders had come knocking? My point is that unless you venture, your mind that is, to the North side of the wall you may never find out.

My lazy mind was working double in late 2013 when analyzing the cable channel owners specifically Discovery Communications. It traded at a reasonable valuation (~19x forward earnings) and exuded all the telltale characteristics of a business with a moat. It printed industry-leading margins and solid returns on invested capital due also in part to the asset-light nature of its operations. I reasoned that a moat was dug on the backs of its content ownership (intangible assets) and distribution mite (economies of scale/intangible asset).

A little over a year later, admittedly with some benefit of hindsight, I revisited Discovery this time consciously avoiding using the traditional moat framework. After much reading, it hit me. Many of those telltale “signs” were simply a byproduct of a cozy mutual back-scratching relationship between cable channel owners and cable companies (e.g., Time Warner Cable) at the cost of consumers. Neither party wanted to break rank because their scale and control of the flow of content depended on it. In some ways, the system was built on phony economics at the cost of consumers and the true value creators (i.e., talented producers, writers, actors, actresses, etc.) Discovery was in large part a deep-pocked curator. Any scale related cost or procurement advantages it had would likely weaken as the importance of the channel-cableco relationship lessened and new entrants took up arms. After much thought, some picture drawing, and more reading, I sat down and wrote. This was around the time I started becoming wary of using the word moat and trying to develop a framework in its place – the topic of a  future blog post I hope!

Today, the idea of a moat and use of the term as a descriptor is becoming more mainstream and more dangerous in my opinion. References are casually dropped when support and context are needed. The term seems to be on the inflection of the S-curve in Silicon Valley especially. On a recent podcast, moat was blurted out seven or eight times in 15 seconds when describing just about every department and business at Amazon. Growing interest and adoption seems apparent when looking at Google search trends.

At the end of the day, I think it’s great that more folks are thinking about business model fundamentals. However, we shouldn’t turn into men and women with only a hammer seeking to reduce the complex into a single word. As I learned, the misuse of cognitive helpers/mental models can quickly turn into cognitive glitches.

I have some ideas for some research that requires a bunch of historical option data - but I have no data access.  

I have a friend who is a PhD candidate and his school subscribes to OptionMetrics.  I'm going to be visiting his campus and hope to pull as much data as possible over the course of a day.

t3_6tu5t6,The future of retail,"I mentioned Big 5 and Hibbett Sports in an earlier post. These are two companies that are profitable now, and have been for over a decade, even during the last recession. 

Many comments mentioned the future of retail and that retail is facing headwinds. What may happen to retail, as happens in some other sectors, is that when certain retailers go bankrupt and move-out, there are some factors that can damage or support other retailers who 'survive':
- downside - less shopping traffic because less stores are out there. Why go to the mall if it is missing 2 anchors? Bad for the other retailers...

- upside - Real estate prices (sale and lease) are nosediving. Profitable companies are then given a chance to expand, with a lower SG&A.

How much these 2 factors counter balance one another, I'm not sure.

I think that it might be time to pick profitable retailer (like Big5 and Hibbett, and Genesco), they will likely outperform the market when the cyclical retail downturn is over.

I do think the current downturn is cyclical, and I think that it is also due to Internet. It's not only due to the Internet. Retail is highly cyclical (on a 5-10 year cycle), and I think that we are experienced selling that doesn't price a return to revenue growth.  ",6,0.87,1502804436.0
t3_6trgom,Why are Big 5 Sports and Hibbett Sports trading as poorly as they are?,"Both are trading below book value.
Both have positive (yet declining) operating income, AND net income.
Book Value (equity) is on the rise steadily, with no 12 month period decline over the last 10 years.
Both are buying back stock, Hibbett much more than Big 5.
Big 5 is trading at 0.96 Book Value.
Hibbett is trading at 0.87 Book Value.
The P/B ratio of these companies is LOWER today than it was in 2008.
Current assets are greater than total liabilities, for both companies.
Shiller PE for Big5 is now 9.66, and Hibbett is at 6.

Personally, I think that good companies are getting punished in the so called retail 'apocalypse' due to investors fleeing anything associated with retail.
 
Do you think there is reason to believe that either of these 2 companies could decline to the point of collapse? Or is there sufficient margin of safety to make entry into these positions to see a market recovery.

Looking for more ideas in retail, but these 2 constantly come back because their gross, operating, and net incomes are always in the black, both during this current down-cycle and the 2008 recession.


Edit: Comparing this to Dick's Sporting Goods (which bought out the Sports Authority assets after Kmart ran them into the ground):
Dick's sporting goods posts good financials as well but they are trading at price-to-tangible-book of 2.5 (vs less than 1 for the other two), has Shiller PE of 17.

I'm asking anyone out there if they are willing to mentor, just for a little bit until I can get on my feet alone. I want to learn how to analyze companies, what's a buy and what's a sell, how to tell a growing company from a failing one, maybe even a fraudulent one. I just want to start because I want to move in the direction of becoming an analyst at a hedge fund. I really just need help starting because I don't see how reading random 10k's helps because firstly I don't know what the heck to look for and secondly I'm very new.

t3_6vkqn7,what is the purpose of an MLP?,"I'm asking this question more from the perspective of the sponsor/general partner.

1. So you have say an oil/gas/coal/ that also happens to have midstream assets like a pipeline.

2. The assets earn consistent cash flow, which makes them appropriate to put into an MLP structure that pays a dividend, as MLP investors who want income are attracted to the consistent nature of the dividend.

3. The sponsor/GP drops down these consistent-cashflow-producing assets into the MLP, receiving either cash from new shares the MLP issues to the public or MLP shares in exchange for those assets. The GP also gets IDRs, where if the MLP pays out more dividends than some threshold, the GP gets a large portion of it vs. the MLP unit holders. So the GP, which manages the MLP, is incentivized to have the MLP grow its cash dividends, which ends up benefitting MLP unit holders overall, but the GP to a bigger extent.

4. MLP unit holders get favorable tax treatment - distributions reduce cost basis and once cost basis is below $0, distributions are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. 

So what is the benefit to the sponsor or GP here as far as dropping the asset into the MLP as opposed to just hanging onto it?

Is it that MLP investors, who are typically very yield hungry, will pay more for the asset when it's put into the MLP as opposed to if the sponsor tried to sell the asset directly to another buyer (like another E&P)?",6,0.8,1503511077.0

I've always been confused about the logic behind the beta portion of CAPM. Beta is only a measure of volatility, and therefore does not reflect the risk of permanent loss. An investor with a reasonably long time horizon can ignore short term volatility. Theoretically, if two equal companies return 10% over a long time period but Company A and B's betas are 1 and 2, respectively, I'm indifferent between the investments on a day prices are equal.

&nbsp;

My questions are as follows:

1. Does anyone have a source showing beta correlates directly with permanent risk of loss?

2. If not, why use beta as a measure of risk?

3. If you think it's inappropriate to use beta to calculate WACC, what better methods exist?

t3_6x8yb7,"""Mania Dislocation""","So I've been thinking about the how this market keeps on chugging and chugging along, and at this point it's almost as if the universe is trying to see what it can get away with (hurricane, missile firings, etc.) and not give the market indigestion. 

This isn't about debating the bulls who say ""this time is different"" (here's looking at you JG) and talk up changes in profit margins, interest rates and other factors for reasons that the market is overvalued. 

This is more to address the agnostics who point to the lack of a mania, ergo no bubble and no drastic overvaluation. 

Enter the ""Theory"" of mania dislocation, which posits that unlike previous manias overvaluation and mania need not appear in the same asset class. 

Say what you want about ETFs, but they do provide a certain stability to the markets, so much so that Seth Klarman mentioned the phenomena that things that fall through the index cracks will be mispriced for a longer period of time then say other things that has indiscriminate selling. 

Be that as it may stability usually doesn't go together with manias. Enter Bitcoin, a mania that's ubiquitous these days.  If you speak to people in other niches of different asset classes you'd find other mini manias- check out cap rates on multi-families in certain parts of the country for example.

The point is that false sense of security makes people think that things will always stay like this and that nothing will go down again. This creates the backdrop where manias can fester, and this atmosphere is what is letting the manias  suddenly spiral out of control.

t3_6xjnd3,The Intelligent Investor:Chapter 20 (beginner needs help),"Hey guys,
I have just started reading about investment and this page is a great help into providing links to great resources. However, I am having a difficulty understanding the concept of Margin of safety and hope that you guys can clear things out a bit. The book version I am referring to is ""The Intelligent Investor: Revised Edition, with new commentary by Jason Sweig"". 


* First paragraph of page 515. It said that ""Over a ten-year period, the typical excess of stock earning power over bond interest may aggregate 50% of the price paid."" I am not sure how Graham arrive at this figure of 50%. If he is referring to the example he give in page 514, wouldn't the calculation be something like this ?


>(1.09)^(10)  -  (1.05)^(10) =  0.74 (74%)



* On last paragraph of page 515 (continue to page 516), Graham mention that a the company with earning return of 8.333% (4% divided yield and 4.33% reinvested in business) would not provide an enough margin of safety over bond over the period of 10 years. 
Referring to question 1, why is the company with earning power of 9% have good margin of safety, but a company with earning power of 8.33% not ? Is it due to the fact that only 4% is paid as dividend ? If possible, can you please show a simple calculations?



* On the foot note of page 515, Jason mention that ""a company with 9% earning power when compared against 4% on bond would give a margin of safety of over 100%.""I thought that the margin of safety in this case would be:

>(0.09 - 0.04)/(0.09) = 55% , as the earning power of the stock can fall 55% to match the bond yield. My thought is that, if it does fall 55%, there would be no margin of safety as you would be better off buying a bond.

I ask because in my country's stock market, the property stocks are selling at a huge discount to their ROEs.

t3_6zry1o,STRI--- A NET NET trading at 10% of tangible assets.,"STRI( STR Holding Inc.) has been a stock beat up on for years. They are a solar encapsulate company that has suffered from negative margins and falling market share. After selling a large stake to a Chinese solar company they were hoping to compete more cheaply with a new cenergy but falling prices and un-credit worthy customers made it clear that an American company in China is unable to compete in this industry. With that realization, they are closing all Chinese operations and moving into India, where we are assured that there is higher profit and more trustworthy customers, but I have my doubts.

So all that being said I think this is one of best stocks on the market. As of 6/30/17 their balance sheet has 14M cash/ 20M current assets/ 35M total assets and 6M total debt. That is 8M net cash/ 14M net current assets and 29M net tangible assets. Oh, silly me, I forgot to mention this is all currently selling for a market cap of 3.5M. They are also in the process of selling a factory for 6M cash. So they selling at around 25% of net cash alone.

For a fire sale like this you would assume, and most of the time be correct, that this is too good to be true. But they are not printing new shares/ going dark/ raising debt/ chinese or going bankrupt any time soon. In fact they are running a burn rate of about 300K a quarter. That would give them almost 12 years to figure out a plan even if they don't sell more assets or turn profitable.

To me this fits all my classic marks for a simple mean reversion. They can become profitable with current business/buy another profitable business with cash/liquidate or slowly burn through assets for years, in which case you will have plenty of time to sell.  The low prices are a function of being OTC and being unprofitable. But because its otc you are mostly dealing individual investors who long on ideas and short on time horizon.

t3_72lq36,Grocery Sector,"Hey everyone,

Im looking at the bombed out grocery Sector (specifically Kroger) for opportunity and I'm finding it hard to see lots of asymmetric upside here.

Groceries are a stable business but highly competitive, low margin, and the industry seems to struggle earning excess returns.

Becuase margins are so slim and there's opps for operating leverage it seems to me a core driver of valuation is sales growth, which is largely driven by inflation dynamics on a macro level. My issue with that is that in inflation, wholesale prices rise faster than retail and I'd imagine grocers try to keep prices low to keep traffic, at the expense of margins. In deflation, everyone is incentivized to cut prices to boost traffic, at the expense of gross margins.

So the way I see it is that no matter what, there is a strong competitive lid on gross margins in either an inflationary or deflationary environment.

Add to that the increased competitive pressures from Amazon (who doesn't care about margins) WMT Aldi and other discount brands, I fail to see the upside case from here for a Kroger, despite the fact they are one of the better operators in the space.

I guess my thought is the macro picture is so bad, and so many of the companies seem to be driven by hard to predict macro variables, that there's not a lot of margin of safety or asymmetry in outcomes in the space.

Am I thinking about this the right way? What am I missing here? ",7,0.89,1506445070.0

It has been around since 1979 and only recently went public (December of last year). What is fascinating is that they did not go public to pay down the debt but for expanding its operations (they already were profitable with sufficient positive free cash flow to fund its operations). The management stated in its recent investor presentation that it seeks to focus primarily on telecomm industry due to its high projected growth for next 5 to 10 years.

It is vertically integrated from manufacturing, sales, and services of these DC power systems and therefore have operated with above industry average margin.

The earnings and FCF has been extremely volatile (along with their stock) due to lumpy cash inflow and delay in revenue recognition with backlogs. This is further complicated with RFPs(Request For Proposal) approach to the international power systems market with greater competition from other foreign incumbents.

t3_72sffc,Valuation question - long term tax rate,"Company has 20% FCF margins and trying to get a sense for what that those will be 10 years from now.

Fortunately company is very predictable however the one big question is tax rate. The company has historically generated significant losses and was only recently profitable so they currently only pay very limited taxes. Assume going forward they will generate sufficient earnings to utilize all the tax benefits. They also have about half a billion in NOLs and a TRA liabilitybfrom an Up-C IPO structure which my understanding is that it reduces future tax burden although they most pay out a majority of that benefit to pre-IPO holders.

Main questions are:
1. How would you think about tax rate 10ish years from now? 
2. How would you think about the NOLs and Up-C payments over time?
3. Looking out very long term as in 20-30+ years once all tax benefits have been utilized, how would you think about a run-rate tax rate? Would it be mainly federal + state taxes + foreign earnings taxes?

t3_734yxn,My understanding of interest rates,"Interest rates control money, which makes interest rates the de facto most influential thing in finance. 

When interest rates decline, valuations go up because you are transferring wealth from the future to the present. You are effectively 'borrowing' wealth from the future and realizing it now.

Low interest rates make money extremely cheap. Cheap money allows business to earn 1-2% returns on 0-1% loans and still come out ahead. Cheap money = greater price competition as businesses can afford lower profits (or sustain losses). Low prices = low inflation


Low interest rates cause a rush into equities as future inflation expectations are greater than yields. As the trend in equities continues upward, more money is stored in equities. The increasing valuation of equities decreases the money supply, temporarily lowering inflation rates.


Once equities reach a peak and money flows out, inflation will start to rise. Once inflation rises, rates will come up. Once rates come up, valuations decrease and more money flows out of equities/bonds. This eventually leads to a credit crash and interest rates finally reset to reflect reality. 


If interest rates continue to decrease. equities/assets may continue to increase in valuation. However, negative interest rates are deflationary. Deflation is the absolute worse thing to happen in a debt fueled economy.


To sum, we are fucked.

t3_73hh5s,Question about ROE.,"Hello, 

I am new to investing and it is mainly a hobbit for now. I invest in equity since 1 year and i try to learn as much as i can! (I work in a totally unrelated field and my experience in finance and business is my own and my reading, that's it.) So here goes my question :

ROE is an important metric for me when assessing a potential investment. The thing is it don't take the asset stock price into account. For this measure to be accurate in the stock market, it requires that the P/B ratio is 1. I know that fundamentally, ROE is a performance metric and it is highly contested but i think it can be useful to factor in the price you pay the assets.

I now simply multiply the shareholders equity by the price-to-book ratio before calculating the the ROE. So i have another version of ROE that factor in price. I usually use both the original ROE and the ''adjusted'' ROE when assessing an investment prospect.

For you, more experienced investor and mathemathician, i can't be the first to have thinked about that? Is there another name that i haven't found yet for this concept? Am i fooling myself with this? Is it totally useless and inacurrate and not the proper way to do it?? What do you think about that??

t3_741o6g,How is what Goldman Sachs did to Long Term Capital Management legal?,"From Sebastian Mallaby's More Money than God

“On September 13 Meriwether appealed to Jon Corzine of Goldman Sachs. He needed help in raising $2 billion, the amount that Long-Term now needed to stave off bankruptcy. Corzine said yes, but at an extraordinary price. In exchange for $1 billion from Goldman plus a promise to raise an additional billion elsewhere, Goldman demanded half of the LTCM management company, full access to the fund’s strategies, and the right to impose limits on the fund’s positions; what’s more, the deal would only go through if Goldman raised the money and Long-Term passed a detailed inspection of its portfolio. These terms meant that Goldman would win either way. Either it would get half of Long-Term at a bargain price or it would get the right to inspect Long-Term’s trading books, paying nothing at all for information that might be worth millions. The predeal due diligence would allow Goldman’s experts to see precisely what Long-Term owned and therefore precisely which trades would crater if Long-Term’s demise forced it to dump holdings.

Long-Term sensed it might be setting itself up for abuse, but it had no alternative. Jim Rickards tried to get Goldman’s inspection team to sign a nondisclosure agreement; he was brusquely informed that Goldman would sign nothing.44 According to Rickards, Goldman’s inspectors plugged an oversized laptop into LTCM’s network and downloaded the details on its positions. Goldman denied that this occurred, but pretty soon the bank’s proprietary trading desk was selling positions that resembled LTCM’s, feeding on Long-Term like a hyena feeding on a trapped but living antelope. The firm made only a qualified effort to defend what it was up to. A Goldman trader in London was quoted as saying: “If you think a gorilla has to sell, then you sure want to sell first. We are very clear on where the line is; that’s not illegal.” Corzine himself conceded the possibility that Goldman “did things in markets that might have ended up hurting LTCM. We had to protect our own positions. That part I’m not apologetic for.” Goldman’s defense was that its selling was not influenced by its privileged knowledge of LTCM’s books and that a Chinese wall separated the inspectors who visited Long-Term from the traders who managed Goldman’s proprietary capital. There was no proof to the contrary, but some Wall Streeters suspected that the Chinese Wall might be porous.

 “Salomon executives reported that Goldman’s Tokyo desk was “banging the shit” out of Long-Term; Goldman executives reported that Salomon was doing the same thing in Europe. Around midday, attacks on Long-Term’s positions in equity options grew so extreme that options prices implied a crash every month. By the end of that Monday, LTCM had lost $550 million, one third of its equity. For the first time its capital had sunk below $1 billion.”

t3_74gu0i,Tips On Networking Into A Value-Oriented HF,"Long time subscriber/fan of this sub.

I'm about three years out of undergrad and hustled my way into a part-time side-hustle at a new, very small equity l/s fund doing mostly investor relations work. It's a super small fund (literally a PM and two sales people who work there part-time), and I've started hitting up the PM to start a gradual back & forth on companies I'm following that I think would make good investments. So I can craft a few equity-research related projects during my time here   

Am hoping to end up with a full-time position at a value-oriented HF. Tips on how to use this side-hustle to my benefit? So far my thoughts are...

1) Now that I have an E-Mail address associated with a HF, apply for SumZero buyside
2) Use said E-Mail address to join HF-industry related mailing lists.
3) Use said E-Mail address to join HF-industry related networking groups.

t3_74rhhy,Graham and Fisher are telling me to buy FOSL (Fossil Group).,"TL;DR: FOSL could double overnight, and could 10x in 3-5 years. Despite being a profitable operating company over decades and recessions, FOSL (Fossil Group) is trading below book value, due partially legitimately due to reduction in operating income, but exacerbated by Restructuring Charges and a Goodwill write off. These apparent declines in operating quality as actually a part of the improvement of the business in the long run. The stock is trading as if it was a dead zombie, but its future is just beginning. 

Hi all,
In an effort to revisit stock market investing in a better way, I've been reading Graham and Fisher, along with Lynch, Greenblatt, and others. 
I'm considering taking a sizable position, so here is my basic analysis, I hope you can improve on it. 

After writing the below report, these are my thoughts:
This is a chance to buy a global brand that is unwavering operating profits over decades including recessions, including now. The stock is being punished for the following reasons:
1. Declining sales, sales have dropped from $3.5b in 2014 to $2.8 in TTM (2012 levels).  We may see unimpressive sales this Christmas due to the retail 'apocalypse' especially in regards to retail sales and store closures. My only hesitation to pounce on the stock is the opportunity to buy it for 1/2 price if the Christmas season is bad. I'll buy in increments.

2. Restructuring right offs. $150m charge over a few years, making an already weak operating margin worse.

3. Good will write off of $400m due to reduced stock price and impaired sales. (Question: how could goodwill be affiliated with stock price?) 
Adding back the restructuring charges and asset write down, the company earned operating incomes of 567m in 2014, 315m in 2015, $155m in 2016, $93m in TTM. Interest is about $35m/year right now leaving $58m, a 7.6 PE ratio (at 433m market cap). If their earnings return to only $100m/year it would be a 4 PE stock, and if they recover only to 2008/2009 levels of $206m income then the stock is trading at a PE of 2.

I'm primarily handicapped because I don't know what I don't know. Can you tell me why this is isn't a magical time to buy the company, and then buy more if the market tanks because of predictably ugly retail numbers. I think this company is being thrown out with the bath water.

Fisher's 15 points
1. Yes, this company can potentially make a sizable increase in sales for at least several years. It can increase its sales by continuing to deliver products to the tastes a growing population, plus it has room to grow in the global market. (They are opening a new Hong Kong office).

2. Yes, the management is determined to continue to develop products that will increase total sales potentials. This is best demonstrated with the multi-year restructuring program that began in 2016 (""New World Fossil""), which targets improvements in operating profit ($150m investment is supposed to bring over $100m/year in savings), and supports sales growth through a leaner infrastructure and an 'enhanced' business model (not sure what that means), but it likely has to do with optimizing for more ecommerce.

3. The company doesn't do research and development, but it does create new products and new partnerships. In new developments, they have a strong horse in the digital watch space (Fossil entered the top 5  for the first time and much of this is credited to the acquisition of Misfit in late 2015. With a large distribution network of fashion stores and multiple brands Fossil managed to attract a previously unaware audience to the wearables market.) Growth in this space has been phenomenal, increasing market share by 217%. Additionally, they are continually on the cutting edge of fashion brands, and would expect them to maintain this edge (branded watches) as new fashion brands arise in the future.

4. Yes, above average sales organization. Grew sales from 105m in 1993 to $3b in 2016 (peaked at $3.4b in 2014).

5. Yes, worthwhile profit margin. Gross margins are steady over 50%, operating margin is typically around 15%, but has averaged about 11% due to the recent restructuring AND the goodwill write off. Based on the sine-wave trend going back to 1993, it looks like every ±8 years they go through a period of low margins (5), followed by a period of high margins (18). Net margin is usually around 8%. The operating income would cover the interest expense would be covered by 5-10 times on a typical year.

6. The company is improving margins by its $150m restructing plan, downsizing retail locations, increasing investments in digital products, structural improvements in their ecommerce business.

7. Based on their corporate marketing, it looks like Fossil is a great and fun place to work. (rated 3.6 out of 5 on Glassdoor)

8. They recently hired Gail Tifford, VP from Unilever overseeing media and digital strategy, so they are attracting good executive talent.

9. Yes, has depth to management, the growth trend has been for decades, and many people have participated in the success.

10. The company likely has sufficient cost analysis and accounting controls given the scale of their mass production. I don't know a way to check that right now.

11. In relation to competition, we have already seen their explosive growth in digital watches, entering the global top 5 and likely to rise. Fossil has an interesting advantage because of their dedication to leveraging other brands to sell their watches across new and different markets. Most people still wear watches, what you wear is guided by a set of principles you have, and Fossil appears to be above average in providing the fashion accessories that the public wants over a long period of time. I never had a Fossil watch myself, and the first watch I ever wore was a Huawei Android watch, but I didn't like it, then wore a Hamilton automatic watch for about 2 years, until I decided to get a Rolex. The path for Fossil watches wasn't relevant for me personally because I never wore a watch growing up, and by the time that I did I jumped to the best android watch at the time, and then since my real estate business was doing well, I decided to splurge on the Rolex. I am not an example of their potential market, although for a moment when I had an android watch I was, and at that time I might have picked Fossil's version, but they did not have the same products then as they do today, nor the sales numbers!

12. I think that Fossil has the potential to increase their long term profits. The trend is to higher profit margin sales thanks to ecommerce, the question is whether dropping retail sales can be totally made up by ecommerce sales, and retail margins made up by ecommerce margins. No question, the restructing the company is doing is designed to increase margins, the company has a good track record of delivering higher margins after periods of lower sales.

13. With over $300m cash in the bank and a fully profitable operating business, Fossil is unlikely to raise equity to expand their business. In fact, despite cutting back stock repurchases in 2016, they started to pay down their long term debt.

14. Management seems transparent and relevant in regards to discussing the current situation of declining revenue and the two one-time charges (restructuring and goodwill), but I have not spoken with management myself nor listened to their calls.

15. Considering the long track record of the company, its global brand, and watching insiders buy millions of $ in stock is a positive for the sake of their integrity.


Substantial insider buying after the recent down turn in price. Short interest is still very high, over 64%, could that be a mistake on their part at this point? Even after the massive goodwill write off, the stock is trading at .79 Tangible Book, almost equal to the 0.72 PB ratio, this is half of where the stock was in the 2008 recession. 
Around 5 insiders bought shares between $6.99-$8.73, signaling a significant bottom in the stock.
Value investor Joel Greenblatt started buying at $16-27, and increased his position at $9-18. 

edit: Sorry I missed one Fisher's 15 about the worthwhile margins. During normal economic conditions the margins are above average in this business.",16,0.9,1507333250.0
t3_74qe9z,"Are automakers trading at low earnings multiples out of fears of recession, oil shocks, rising interest rates? Or something else?","Based on the ""bond bubble,"" and pretty healthy yield curve, it would seem that the market doesn't expect an imminent rise in interest rates leading to defaults and reduced financing. Based on crude futures trading at around $50 for the next several years, it would seem that the market doesn't expect rising oil prices(and makes hedging possible in any case). 

If these are the case, why are the automakers generally trading at such low earnings multiples relative to the S&P 500? Are the analysts that good at their job that they can know that new car sales are going to slump in the future? Fears of emissions regulations, EV adoption? Ride-sharing?

t3_74zw4c,Learning about investing in distressed / opportunistic credit vs equities,"Hello guys,

I am a current student studying finance at a US target with the goal of going into the alternative investing space (HF/PE). I have been practicing, reading, and learning about accounting, finance, and value investing, and I have done several equity pitches in school and on my own. 

Today I want to ask about a question that has been on my mind for quite some time. As US equity market has been getting more and more efficient, many professionals in the alt space has turned to special situations / distressed / more esoteric opportunities in search for alpha.(I can be completely wrong about this but this is not my main point)

Now, in my opinion and limited experience, I found that there is a difference in the mindset and skill set required to be a successful investor in this space (opportunistic credit, distressed debt...etc) comparing to let's say traditional equities. What I mean is the credit space (not talking about vanilla IG FI) requires much more financial/accounting technical knowledge, Bx/Rx legal knowledge, and capital structuring, while traditional equity investing requires more knowledge on industries, sector, and growth forecasting. You can think about this contrast reflected as an analyst's skill sets working in a credit HF vs a top equities AM.

I would like to get industry professionals' take on this topic, and furthermore, do you think it is then necessary for someone to master the skills of traditional equity investing in order to succeed in the opportunistic credit space? Or should an aspiring student go directly to learn and practice for the type of investing he is most interested in?

t3_75hlg0,Let's talk Non-GAAP metrics,"I've been spending some time lately thinking over the concept of Non-GAAP metrics both in terms of practicality of existence as well as the way investors/analysts interpret them. Due to the type of companies I look at, nearly every one has their own Non-GAAP version of adjusted EBITDA/FCF/revenue, etc...

There are certain limits that GAAP imposes on financial reporting. Because businesses and their models change faster than governing bodies can reasonably respond to, sometimes GAAP just doesn't reflect the economic reality of what is going on. 

In light of that, there are times when I think Non-GAAP reporting makes sense and those metrics are useful to look at. For instance, Valeant was known to be a heavy pusher of their Non-GAAP Cash EPS number, but if you go back and look at the add-backs most of them make sense. In fact, the reasons why the Company blew up didn't really have anything to do with their Cash EPS number at all...meaning, it didn't necessarily hide anything insidious that one wouldn't have been able to identify otherwise. 

Of course, I'm a big believer in auditing the add-backs. For example, I recently looked at a Company with reported Adjusted EBITDA of around ~$250.0mn. If I stripped out all of the add-backs, Operational EBITDA was around -$20.0mn. That wouldn't be fair, though, since some add-backs were legitimately non-cash such as impairments and others. So Cash EBITDA comes out at ~$150.0mn. Essentially, ~$100.0mn of the add-backs were sketchy and really recurring cash items. Definitely a curious case where a skeptical mind and vigilant eye towards the reconciliation came in handy, but not necessarily something that I'm going to overly penalize the Company for. 

Where I get frustrated with Non-GAAP metrics isn't really the way which Company's employ them. Sure, they'll highlight them rather than GAAP metrics, maybe have their bonus structured off of Non-GAAP targets, etc but none of that really matters to me because 1) underlying decay in the core business will eventually erode even the most add-backy of Non-GAAP figures since there is only so much one can find to add-back, and 2) you don't get any points in blowing the whistle on Non-GAAP numbers. 

And its the second point where I find myself getting frustrated with the analyst community. For some reason, I find a lot of write-ups and opinions where the analyst crucifies management for trying to ""deceive"" the investing public by adding back certain things to whatever metric. No one is getting deceived. At least, no one who is smart and checks the numbers is. Investing based solely off management's Non-GAAP figures is essentially the same as investing based on an analyst recommendation without doing any work and then blaming the analyst when it goes wrong. 

I have even seen some write-ups where the analyst accuses management of fraud for adding back certain things which is just silly. The add-backs are disclosed, the reconciliation is provided, and the auditor has signed off on it. Besides, as analysts we are all making our own pro-forma adjustments anyway. 

So then how do you look at the figures? 

Refer to my example above (which I affectionately refer to as the add-back queen internally). Cash EBITDA is really -40.0% less than what the Company is reporting and has been flat to LSD declining over the last several years while reported Adjusted EBITDA is flat to LSD increasing over the same period. What I really care about is 1) the underlying performance and trend of the business (my Cash EBITDA #), and 2) whether or not the amount of bad add-backs are shrinking as a % of what is reported as well as if the sequential line-items are recurring or something new. 

In this particular example, underlying performance is deteriorating and the nature of the add-backs is not changing (meaning as a % of Reported as well as recurring nature). My Cash EBITDA number is now supporting a substantial debt load at 7.0x (vs. Reported 4.0x), with near term maturities, low maturity, and the bond slightly off from par. Makes a pretty good short in my opinion. 

Which brings me to final (maybe?) point. Some might say, well the credit agreement allows add-backs of X,Y and Z nature so the Reported figure is what the lenders are looking at and they say it is alright. True, its allowed. But if the business cannot/principal payment and needs to refinance the lenders may say ""sure you have a nice Reported # which we technically allow, but we're not stupid and can see what your real performance is and we're not going to refinance you"". Then, the Company is in serious trouble. 

So I think that wraps up my long winded rant on Non-GAAP figures. I'm not sure if it really ended up in the direction it may have seemed to be going since I just pulled a recent example I could think of, but my main points are that 1) Non-GAAP in itself is not a sin and something a Company should be crucified for, and 2) ultimately, thoughtful analysis of the underlying fundamentals will ultimately get you where you need to go. 

Maybe it would have made more sense if I used an example where everyone hated the Non-GAAP number but it turned out to be right, but oh well. 

Curious to hear any other thoughts on the topic.

I'd like to ask a rather straightforward question. I have a deep interest in investing, especially in so far as public equities are concerned. I graduated not too long ago. I do work in the Asset Management industry at one of the largest firms in my country, but I work in operational/enterprise risk management and exposure to the investment side per se is limited.

I started investing my own capital in the local stock market at the start of this year. I have say, about $40k of capital invested at the moment, $45k by year's end, and about $65k by the end of next year. I intend for the market value of my holdings to top $120k in 3 years. I've invested solely on a cash upfront basis using money I've saved/earned over recent years.

I've read the works of and look up to the investing philosophy of the following people - Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch, Seth Klarman and Walter Schloss. Suffice to say, I am very much attracted to the value investing framework of the aforementioned investors.

Thus far, I've done decently I'd say. On an XIRR basis I've got 21% net returns, with low turnover. I also have a fairly concentrated portfolio of six positions.

Initially I embarked on my portfolio merely as a personal goal to achieve strong absolute returns over the long run. But recently my mind has begun entertaining the idea of taking my portfolio performance and investment philosophy (after a minimum 2 to 3 year period of course) to asset management companies and pitching for the role of a fund manager.

How feasible is this? I have decent mathematics background (have a Bachelor's in Actuarial Science), a decent handle of identifying potentially undervalued companies, and a decent grasp of micro and macro economics.

Before I entertain this thought any further, I would like to know very honestly from the good people on these forums. Would such a career path be possible? Or should I come back down to earth?

Appreciate any and all responses. Thanks!

EDIT: **Thank you everyone! Sobering responses indeed. In no way I think I have it in me just yet, which is why I said it very clearly in the title of this post that the portfolio should be running for 3-5 years before I pitch myself as a fund manager. And yes, I am well aware of two things: that don't mistake a bull market for intelligence, and that I am probably being fooled by randomness (I read the book by Taleb and it's one of my best reads!). Yet I shall not be deterred. Maybe the angle of going into fund management at an institutional firm might be wrong and I should be looking at setting up my own fund...why knows. I am mindful of all your comments regardless and appreciate every one of them!**",6,0.63,1508501527.0

t3_78i7hu,Long KO,"Not the most comprehensive pitch I've ever made on here, but I'd also say this is one of the easiest layups I've come across. 

**Investment Thesis** 

The Coca-Cola Company (“KO”) equity represents a rare opportunity to invest in a misunderstood mega-cap that is set to expand margins, grow free cash flow, and increase returns on invested capital. My variant opinion is that at 23.4x NTM earnings, KO equity currently does not price in the upside offered by the forthcoming completion of their bottling operation restructuring efforts and instead reflects the typical consensus story of whether volumes will either be LSD or MSD. Normalized earnings, through the noise of the restructuring operations, show a business that is set to return capital to shareholders after several years of disappointing returns (~5.0% P.A. excl. dividend 2012 – Present). 

**Business Description** 

KO produces syrup concentrate used in the production of various carbonated and un-carbonated beverages. KO’s syrups are sold to bottler partners on a global basis. These bottler partners control regional/local Coca-Cola franchises. The bottlers make the finished product, distributed in bottles and cans. Bottlers are responsible for selling, distributing KO products to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors. 

60% of the Company’s FY16 revenues were derived from the sale of finished products and 40% were derived from the sale of concentrates. 48% of the Company’s FY16 revenues came from the United States while 52% came from international sales. 

It is worth noting that over the past several years KO has made an effort to diversify their brand portfolio away from traditional soft drinks and in to sports drinks and vitamin water-type offerings. 

KO maintains equity investments in their bottling partners and receive both equity-interest income and dividends. The market value of these investments is about $20bn. 

**Situation Overview**
 
Over the past three years, KO has been restructuring their bottler relationships across Europe, China, Japan, Africa and North America which will result in 100% of the Company’s unit case volume being distributed by third-party bottlers rather than KO itself. Bottler restructuring will be complete by the end of 2017. 

Parent KO is divesting their interest in their bottling rights to various partners because their national scale is too large to adequately invest in the local-level relationships necessary to build high-margin bottling operations. Restructured bottlers enter into Comprehensive Beverage Agreements (CBA) with Parent KO under which they are authorized to purchase trademark beverages from KO, or another authorized supplier, and exclusively distribute/sell to territories under their agreement. Each CBA has an indefinitely renewable 10-year term. 

Cash flow from the restructuring has been slow to materialize which is why I suspect these activities are never more than a brief footnote in consensus research. 2014 and 2015 proceeds from re-franchising was $713mn while 2016 proceeds were $2.3bn plus another $2.4bn from the sale of Keurig to JAB Holding Co. 

Proceeds through the end of 2017 should come in around $4.5mn from the sale of Chinese bottling operations, divestiture of remaining North American operations, plus dividends and income from bottling equity investments. Management has been quiet about their capital allocation intentions for these proceeds, but suffice to say they have some levers to pull. Before serious returns to shareholders can begin there are a few obligations KO needs to meet first. $3.2bn to Anheuseur-Busch InBev for their interest in CCBA which should be paid 4Q17 (KO intends to immediately sell the CCBA bottling franchise after this, so maybe it is fair to say this transaction nets out). $3.3bn debt matures in 2018, $4.5bn in 2019, and $4.4bn in 2020. 

**Valuation**

Under the following assumptions – 0.0% revenue and EBIT growth – KO will earn $4.9bn FCF per year. With an additional $4.5bn from 2017 activities the Company will be able to meet all of their upcoming obligations, including scheduled share repurchases and dividend hike, without raising additional debt. In fact, at 2.5x net debt, KO has room for an additional full turn of leverage (approx. $10bn debt) that could be returned to shareholders while comfortably maintaining interest coverage.

But how do normalized earnings look? KO earns a 4.3% pre-tax margin on LTM bottling revenues of $15.9bn. Backing out bottling, KO earns $14.2bn normalized LTM EBITDA and $11.4bn LTM FCF (EBITDA – capex – cash interest) (5.1% yield). Company bottlers earn an average 7.5% pre-tax margin on bottling revenues. Assuming 0.0% growth from acquisition of bottling operations, equity income to KO should grow ~41.0% to $1.4bn given a potential ~70.0% growth in bottling pre-tax income to $1.2bn from $0.7bn (calculated as pro-rata KO share of margin uplift plus historical growth of legacy equity income). 

On flat revenues and margins, this will result in ~$12-13bn FCF per year for KO. This is also likely understated due to the real volume benefit gained by better performing bottling operations (KO gains revenue uplift from selling more syrup to bottlers as well as a % of income due to equity ownership). Maybe a more likely scenario would be in the range of $15bn FCF (6.7% yield) per year for KO with unheroic, LSD volume growth. After debt repayments and other obligations this leaves at least an extra $3bn FCF per year for shareholders without adding incremental debt.

On top of this, KO ex-bottling operations will have $37.5bn invested capital (down about $5bn pre-restructuring). On normalized LTM EBIT this yields an ROIC of 33.9%. 

Can you find equity ideas at a more compelling valuation than a 6.7% FCF yield? Of course you can. But a 6.7% yield seems like a good deal for a $200bn market cap business with entrenched competitive dynamics that sustains a 30.0%+ return on invested capital. ",12,0.79,1508873741.0

t3_78ptvx,CSV Thoughts,"Does anyone have any opinions on this Company? I am torn. 

For those unfamiliar, CSV is a death-care operator with an EV of about $810mn ($365mn net debt (5.3x), $445mn equity (12.4x). They operate funeral and cemetery businesses as a levered roll-up. Their CEO is super old and has a background in high yield/reorgs. Unsurprisingly, their cap structure has always ridden the edge. 

Over the past 5 years, CSV has grown EBITDA at about 9% annualized. How they achieve this is weird. Consider same-store operating revenues and profit have grown at 3.2% and 5.6% over the same period. Acquired store revenues and profits have grown at 25.2% and 40.3%, respectively. 

About 20% of operating profit is comprised from M&A additions. 

Another 20% is comprised of commissions earned on insurance sales as well as trust earnings. A unique aspect of this business model is that they sell pre-need funeral/cemetery services up-front, which last in a trust for about 3-5 years. This is sort of like an insurance float and the Company can invest it. What concerns me is that their investment style is fairly aggressive for a trust under an RIA - corporate bonds are a large % of the portfolio - again, not shocking given the CEOs background (and a good # of their analysts I could find on LinkedIn have HY backgrounds) a little more than a year ago, their bond portfolio was quoted at 80%. 

But my gut instinct is that these death care operations are not as profitable as they come off due to the interesting composition of their revenue/earnings stream. 

I mean, its almost like you're not really buying a death care operator. You're buying a Public LBO and RIA. So you're really counting on 1) the ability to continue closing accretive M&A  (and the larger you get, the harder this becomes) and 2) the ability of the RIA to continue performing well. 

But where I'm stuck is that LTM FCF is about $22mn - 2x interest coverage. I haven't done enough work to figure out what the cash flow margin on insurance commissions/trust earnings are, but I suspect it is a high % of FCF. If that business faltered they'd be in trouble. Again, also in trouble if M&A dries up. 

Bonds all have maturities out to 2021 and trade at 2-3% yields, and since I can't really think of a good reason why FCF will actually materially decline I have no reason to short them. But I also can't really think of a good reason to short the equity.

In a nutshell:

- Extremely high quality business with long run-way for growth, top-tier and improving competitive dynamics, and attractive asset-light, SaaS, recession resistant business model; huge customer value proposition.

- Assuming 10 year DCF with FCF growing at 5% per year, 3% terminal growth, 10% cost of equity you get a valuation in line with the current share price. This is way too cheap for a high quality business growing FCF at a mid-teens rate.

- Specifically I think it's mispriced because GoDaddy's industry, business model, and competitive dynamics are misunderstood which in turn leads investors into the ""excessive competition"" bear thesis.

I own shares in a couple companies that are fundamentally sound from a financial and business model perspective, but I wanted to get a deeper look into things that might not be reflected in a 10-K. I looked on Glassdoor for reviews and was somewhat concerned:

&nbsp;

Company A - More of a deep value play (a shipping company trading really cheap)

Reviews did not look great. It seemed like a very cutthroat culture and people were upset about low pay and favouritism regarding promotions. Obviously I wasn't particularly happy with this.

&nbsp;

Company B - More of a Warren Buffett than Ben Graham situation (technology research company with a solid moat, 30% average ROE, huge growth potential and trading slightly cheap even when growth is not considered)

Reviews were mostly positive but concerns raised were hierarchy, being too IP driven instead of practical, trimming pay, and a lack of interaction between different teams

2. Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition - For industrial companies current assets should be at least twice current liabilities. Also, longterm debt should not exceed the net current assets (or “working capital”). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the stock equity (at book value).
3. Earnings Stability - Some earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten years.
4. Dividend Record - Uninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years.
5. Earnings Growth - A minimum increase of at least one-third in per-share earnings in the past ten years using three-year averages at the beginning and end. 
6. Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio - Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets - Current price should not be more than 11⁄2 times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. I suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5 (It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)

If I’m thinking about a long position in this company, why is it important for me to have a (positive) variant perspective? Let’s say I believe the stock is worth $8/share ($2/share less than street consensus). Shouldn’t I still buy the stock, even though I am below consensus?

In other words, we learn it’s important to have a contrarian view and see something the market doesn’t. What if your view is the same as the market’s (which is heavily bullish) or just slightly lower than the ultra-bullish projections?

Lastly, what do you do in situations where there is no Wall Street coverage? This is how I think about investing in these situations: I come up with an intrinsic value and if the current stock price is drastically lower, I will invest (no need to worry about consensus estimates).

t3_7bazjq,CNX Spinoff (CEIX) [Long Thesis],"CNX is a gas and coal company that’s spinning off it’s coal business. Management indicated that they wanted out of coal. I think most of the institutional shareholders want out of the coal business as well. Clean energy has been coming down significantly in price, and coal is simply dirty. Right now, all the stock is owned by institutional owners, and I’m willing to bet they all see CNX as a gas company. In addition, CEIX will pay CNX $450 million, and they’ll source these funds by taking on debt. 

CEIX’s coal business is a low-cost producer, and so they are positioned to benefit relative to the rest of the industry as prices are cut. While coal use has been decreasing, conservative estimates have 25% of US energy needs being met by coal by 2025. It’s decreasing, but coal is not going away. As a result of the pessimism, the valuation of this business is depressed.

Greenlight capital did a presentation on CNX that you can find readily online, and part of that presentation includes a DCF valuation for the coal aspect of the business. Their assumptions for the DCF still hold true, as they’ve used conservative estimates for coal use projections, and what that means for prices. They’ve assumed a spot price per tonne of coal at $50/tonne, increasing to $55/tonne by 2025. The current spot price is $57 (much higher than the values used in their DCF), and it’s likely because of a squeezed supply, since a lot of coal companies have gone out of business. Assigning the conservative price to project out revenue, they’ve assigned a value of $3B to the Thermal Coal business, and $0.5B to the Metallurgic Coal business.

The Spin Off

For every 8 shares of CNX you have, you receive 1 share of CEIX (the CoalCo spinoff company). 

The CFO of CNX was apparently deeply involved in the orchestration of this spin off, and he will be the new CFO of CEIX. In addition, CNXC, which holds approximately 10% of CEIX’s mines is currently valued at a market cap of $394.7M. That implies a $3.9B market cap for just the mine assets of CEIX (since they own the rest).

I think CEIX will be oversold by institutional owners who want in on a gas company because gas prices are projected to keep going up, and to take away from oil.

I also believe the structure of giving 1 share of CoalCo for every 8 shares of ParentCo, while keeping the number of shares to around 28 million might be to ensure the intrinsic value of the stock price would be high. If the stock were to be fairly valued right off the bat, it would create a “sticker shock” kind of effect that would initially discourage ownership. This means the stock likely won’t be at fair value initially. A depressed initial valuation would benefit management – they haven’t set compensation plans yet, but would be able to cite a lower stock price for the strike price of any options.

Their compensation plan will probably be similar to the compensation plan set for 2016 by CNX. The Long-Term Incentive Compensation was set to be linked to the Relative Total Return to Shareholders (TRS) vs the S&P 500 (50% of additional compensation), and the Absolute Stock Price (the other 50% of additional compensation). 

Finally, CEIX has reserved 2,600,000 shares for employee compensation. Since the total number of shares available will be 28,000,000, this means that a little over 9% of all shares will be reserved for employee compensation. This seems like quite a bit, and management should be aligned with shareholders in that respect. 

The Idea 

Wait until CEIX starts trading on Nov 29th, 2017, and buy in when it’s experiencing selling pressure. 

Side Note: I'm new to this, so if you can mention things I've missed, or tear me a new one, please do so. 

UPDATE: 

Okay, so the interesting thing here is the WACC ends up actually being lower than the WACC calculated by Greenlight. I made the assumption that their interest payments would decrease over 20 years to a quarter of what they will be initially to account for their changing capital structure as they delever. I realize this isn't perfect because it involves a lot of assumptions, but the alternative view is they maintain the same levered capital structure until the mines shut down. 

In any case, once you subtract out the interest payments, and use the updated WACC that accounts for the riskiness in the leveraged capital structure, I got a PV of $3.05B for the Thermal Coal business… but then I updated the DCF for the price of coal they're currently getting (it's not actually $57 - it's $45. Huge oversight on my part). 

It drops the valuation like a stone, but it still may be undervalued once it starts trading. **My assumption here is coal will still hit 55 and stay there by 2025, so I plugged in a smooth increase until that point. I feel like this is important, because a levered coal company that has interest payments would lose money over time if the price didn't go up.** That being said, I also believe it's a reasonable assumption because CEIX is still a cost-leader, and there's not many companies that can survive these prices for long. Sans interest payments, they're in one of the best positions to weather the storm. 

I got a value of $1.9B for the Thermal Coal. I haven't valued the met coal, or the port, and this value only takes into account the guaranteed 700ish million tons that should last about 25 years (there is potentially more, but I'm trying to be conservative). So we'll find out what happens once it starts trading I guess.

t3_7bis15,BBX Capital (NYSE:BBX) - Long Thesis,"On October 23, 2017, BBX Capital (NYSE:BBX) filed a registration statement with the SEC relating to a possible IPO of Bluegreen, the company's wholly-owned vacation ownership or timeshare subsidiary. This would be a very positive development and help to highlight the undervaluation of BBX Capital. BBX is currently trading at $8.79 per share and we think Bluegreen alone is worth $13-$14 per BBX Capital share. The IPO will help to illustrate this value.  

Management appear to be wisely seeking to take advantage of a favourable window of opportunity to list Bluegreen with the share prices of the major competitors (Marriot Vacations (VAC), Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) and ILG (ILG)) up 55% - 65% YTD. These comps now trade on trailing EBITDA multiples of 15.7x, 12.9x and 14.3x respectively.

The IPO registration document shows total outstanding shares after the IPO of 74.7m which, at the mid-point of $17 per share, gives an equity value for Bluegreen of about $1,270m. This equals $12.45 per BBX Capital share or 42% above today's closing price of $8.79.
There is also roughly $2 .00 per share of various real estate assets offset by $0.40 per share of net debt at the holdco that are unrelated to Bluegreen. There are also some net operating losses that will further add to value. This gives a combined value of roughly $13-14 per share for BBX Capital compared to the current price of $8.79 per share or 50% upside. 
Management appears to be taking advantage of strong current trading at Bluegreen and an equity market that has recently re-rated the industry materially. So, hopefully we now have a very near term catalyst to reveal value if management press ahead with the IPO as soon as possible.

The underlying industry of Bluegreen, vacation ownership interests or timeshares, has gone through substantial change over the past decade. The industry has evolved from a capital-heavy, developer-oriented market plagued by bankruptcies and aggressive sales tactics to a much more capital light model involving generally reputable firms such as Starwood, Hilton, Wyndham and Marriot (although still fairly aggressive sales tactics). These companies have spun off these businesses over the past several years and there has been a lot of consolidation in the industry over recent years. This year has seen a dramatic increase in the market value of vacation ownership companies (+55-65% YTD) as they are growing very strongly and earn extraordinary returns on invested capital.

The education of a value investor never ends, and I don't think I'll ever run out of reading in this respect.

I am looking for value investing education in a formal setting, like MBA programs, professional qualifications, or structured courses by business schools. Are there any programs out there that are geared towards value investing careers?

There are obvious answers like the Value Investing Program in Columbia's GSB. However I am looking for an alternative. For those of us who aren't clever enough to make it to Columbia's highly competitive MBA program. I have also looked into continuing the CFA. My personal experience with the curriculum though, is that it seems more like a memory exercise of various accounting conventions and industry practices than a fulfilling education in investing. Not to say I think the course content is not useful, but the opportunity cost with a 300 hour study commitment could be other books that can teach that just as well, or practical knowledge as I go through reports and filings instead of textbooks.

I would probably pay my analyst and asset management staff out of my performance, is this commonly done? 

My two leading ideas are to offer:
4% guaranteed return, then 50/50. (this is like buffetts structure, but again, what expenses am I able to include as a partnership expense vs coming out of my performance bonus?) (A 15% return would be split  9.5% LP 5.5% GP) 

Or, a 60/40 split, the investor earns a preferred return, then I catch-up until my performance split. (a 15% return would be split 9% LP 6% GP) 

The first model benefits me more if make exceptional returns. 

These are mainly personal preferences, but the big question again is how to handle my management expenses, thoughts? (Office (I work at home), staff, CPA, travel expenses related to due diligence or asset management). 

My proud self would prefer to pay for everything myself, but ask for a maximum profit split. But my conservative colleagues suggest charging everything to the partnership, but then I can't justify the same % split.

Long time lurker here, but a first time poster. Would love to get your (collective) thoughts on my hypothesis above - about Foot Locker still being overvalued. I'm considering shorting it before their earnings call on Friday. 

Here's how I came to that recommendation:

1. They're facing a fairly high level of competition from all sides - their biggest suppliers of products are Adidas, Nike, and Under Armour, all of whom are pushing hard to create their own direct-to-consumer sales channels, thereby cannibalizing FL's sales. Also, as a primarily 'bricks and mortar' retail company, Amazon is also a  threat.

2. Between Q2 and Q3, their top-line revenue decreased by ~15%, but their EBITDA decreased by 73%(!!!). The reason for this is because of increases in both their COGS and their SG&A  expenses (as a % of sales)- so they're spending more, but getting fewer sales.

t3_7cn06r,What does it tell you if insiders who collectively own 19.7% of a listed company end up subscribing for 53.9% of the shares in a rights issue?,"Ok, so Company A did a rights issue. They did it such that for every two shares owned, you get a rights share to subscribe to. 

Insiders here are defined as directors and senior management (two EDs, one MD, one FD, and a few heads of departments, including head of export).

As a matter of fact, this group of insiders owned 19.7% of the company collectively prior to the rights issue. 

The reason given for the rights issue was to pare down debts (although net gearing was decent at 0.35x) and for working capital purposes to expand the business. 

This company is introducing a new product range and are planning to export it to Europe. 

Now, the rights issue data is out, and collectively this same group of insiders subscribed for 53.9% of the rights shares. Every single one of the insiders that did hold shares in the company either bought additional rights shares from the market or applied for excess rights shares (a.k.a. over-subscribed). 

The rights issue itself was oversubscribed by 18.1%. 

In the few months leading up to the rights issue, two insiders bought about 2.5% of the outstanding shares on the open market. For the previous 2-3 years insiders have been fairly inactive in the market (some small trades here and there, that's about it). 

---------------------

Now, given just the above info, what does it tell you? Is there a case here to believe that management is hyper positive on their business expansion and new product range? Are there any warning signs? 

The business itself is doing good. They managed to turn around the company some years back by cutting out a loss-making division, and a few months ago changed the company's name slightly. The valuation is, in a word, undemanding. The balance sheet and cash flows are fine - no red lights there. 

The company is in the consumer product manufacturing sector. They're fairly small in market cap though they do have a product that is instantly recognizable by most of the country's population. There are zero institutional investors invested in the company. 

What am I missing? Or does this seem like a golden opportunity to get in before earnings explode? 

PS: They successfully subscribed to 53.9% of the shares in the rights issue. It's safe to assume that they applied for slightly more than this though given the 18.1% oversubscription to the rights issue. ",3,0.67,1510579073.0

They have never invested in a fund, but are helping me build a track record within the firm with the hope of funding me to go out on my own in the future (hedge fund).

I wanted to pick your brains here, especially those who have been/are PM's, regarding 2 things.

&nbsp;

******************************************************
**First**, how do you structure your day? I am trying to become more process-oriented as opposed to goal-oriented in the sense of building routines and habits, so that I can chip away at all my work on a consistent basis. I've fond that since I've started this new job, my work output/productivity tends to fluctuate with my emotional mood/motivation. When I feel good, I get a lot done. When I don't feel good, I basically drag things out forever. 

I want to eliminate this dependency, at least to a sense where I've developed habits/systems that allow me to get work done on a daily basis.

What I'm curious about is for example - do you do your analysis related work (reading a company's filings, etc.) in the mornings? I am trying to read less news in the middle of the day and put stuff like that off till later in the day or night when I'm already tired. For example, you don't need to be mentally fresh to read WSJ. I'd rather spend those hours doing things that require critical thinking.

As an example, here are the things I'd like to get done on a daily/weekly basis:

&nbsp;

*Investing:*

* watch existing positions

* work on ideas in “pipeline”

* check various sources on daily/weekly basis to add new ideas to pipeline

* keep up with general news (macro)

* read various investment blogs I subscribe to that talk about either ideas or investing in general

&nbsp;

*Mental Development/Skill Sharpening:*

* read business history book / maybe take notes

* read biography book (Rockefeller, JP Morgan, Sam Zell, etc.) / maybe take notes

* read investing-related books that discuss various frameworks

&nbsp;

I'm struggling to find a way to set up a daily routine where I can take a whack at a few of these on a daily basis.

&nbsp;

******************************************************
**Second**, I've also found that since starting this PM job, I am watching my Bloomberg Terminal way more than I would like to and getting sort of mentally distracted by day-to-day price fluctuations. Part of it is the emotional aspect of being a PM (i.e. other people have entrusted their capital to you), but the other part is that I'm being given a big opportunity here, and I don't want to blow it.

&nbsp;

When you started off as a PM or as you look back on your career, how did you learn to not let your portfolio performance affect your mood/self-esteem? I'm finding that I'm taking that self-esteem hit home with me, which isn't as big an issue since I'm in my mid to late 20's and not married. But it's something I would like to overcome as soon as possible. Maybe it's just something that will take time and part of the ""growing pains"" of a PM role? I've only been in it since May, so perhaps it will just take more time.

&nbsp;

I feel like these are both some underrated aspects of a ""money manager"" role that deserve more attention.

Would love to hear any thoughts/advice/feedback you could provide

t3_7de475,Call options vs shares in value investing,"Since a lot of value investors are willing to be patient while their thesis plays out (2-3 years in some cases), why don't they invest in call options instead of straight up shares?  I know some do, but majority just buy the equity.

So suppose the stock price is $100 today, and your analysis tells you that it could be worth $150 in 2 years, or $80 in a downside case.  Instead of buying a share for a $100 and waiting patiently, why don't you instead pay $20 (difference between stock price and downside case) as the premium on a call option with a strike of say $120?  The most you will lose is $20, the premium, which is the same as your downside case anyway.  However, if the stock does indeed rise from current levels, the call option will only get more valuable.

As such, you do get paid for your patience on top of the rise in the value of the stock.

t3_7dlngn,Friday Discussion - 'Flash Point' Investing and Negative Media Situations,"Happy Friday! 

  I wanted to start a discussion on investing during 'flash points' - or when a company's stock price rapidly moves (often negatively) as it is subject to negative or positive media exposure. While this is certainly not a novel approach, in my opinion, the proliferation of near-instantaneous media creates more pricing mismatches as negative information is released immediately, and then stocks are re-priced to reflect economic reality over the coming hours, days, weeks, and months. 

  I've found it's not useful **independently** as a tool for finding undervalued securities (except in rare cases), but rather as an additional consideration for bringing ideas you've already researched within your margin of safety. 

  Again, to some, this may sound like a value trap or an attempt to dress up your dogs, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. Anecdotally, I've been pulling the trigger on ~10% or one out of every dozen-or-so 'flash point' situations. It's been incredibly helpful in rounding out my personal investing skillset to non-traditional or special situations (e.g. estimating legal risk re: settlement sizes). As both a caveat and a bonus, I've also found it to be a good gauge of one's own competencies or lack thereof in analyzing the causes and second-order causes of pricing mismatches (i.e. fundamental vs. ephemeral changes in the business). 

  A few examples of 'flashpoints' that have popped up on my radar over the past 24 months: 
  
  - EA post Star Wars BF2 microtransaction debacle  
  
  - Equifax post data breach 
  
  - Walmart + other retailers post Amazon-Whole Foods acquisition 
  
  - Mid major E&P's in early 2016
  
  - UAL post doctor-beating debacle 
  
  - WFC post unauthorized accounts-gate

  - Valeant ('nuff said) 
  
  - Any industries impacted by Trump tweets 

  - Pricing movements related to public declarations by prominent activist investors or short sellers

t3_7fi2xo,Business models that attract Warren Buffett,"Hi so I've been reading a lot of BRK shareholder letters and have started to identify trends of what Warren Buffett looks for in a company.  From my understanding, most of his investments tend to have one or more factors such as attracting a large amount of advance payment from customers, temporarily getting to hold other peoples money(insurance float), has a loan/finance arm, a beneficial tax deferred liability structure usually from long life assets, franchise structure.  Companies usually report these items on their balance sheets as a liability since the money does not belong to them.  Does anybody have a good book to recommend about how to value companies that encompass such ""liabilities""?  Anybody want to post ideas of other companies that contain a ""berkshire approved"" business model?


Some examples:

See's candy=all cash biz, requires mail order(advance payment)

Coca Cola=franchise out all bottling and distribution.  They only provide syrup.

Dairy Queen=franchise stores

MidAmerican/BNSF=tax deferred benefits from long life assets like railroad tracks and utility pipes/conduit

All his Insurance companies=holding insurance premiums and investing them(float)

his bank/finance holdings=holding customer deposits and giving out loans

Blue stamp=No longer around, but the company was able to hold customers' money by forcing people to pay upfront for stamps that they could not redeem for a long time.  They used the money they were holding to finance the purchase of See's Candy and the Buffalo Newspaper.

Newspapers=monthly subscription or advance payment for a year of deliveries, etc

Costco stock=membership requiring advance payment

Airline holdings=Advance payment of tickets, loyalty reward program

Charter Communication= franchise model, subscription payments, tax deferred liabilities from utilities

XTRA truck=lease/financing of trucks

*Edit: I wanted to add a presentation by Mohnish Pabrai, a hedge fund manager, who focuses on Buffett's obsession of float and how he used it to acquire more companies like Sees Candy, Buffalo news, and Wesco.  The first 20 minutes talks about it enough, but the whole presentation is worth it.

t3_7fkvu1,OPINION: Further Upside for Constellation Brands,"Constellation Brands (STZ) is a Fortune 500® company and a leading international producer and marketer of beer, wine and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, New Zealand and Italy. Constellation is the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the U.S. market. The company’s high-end, iconic imported brands include Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Pacifico. The portfolio also includes Ballast Point, one of the most awarded craft brewers in the U.S. In addition, Constellation is the world’s leader in premium wine, selling great brands including Robert Mondavi, Clos du Bois, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Mark West, Franciscan Estate, Ruffino and The Prisoner. The company’s premium spirits brands include SVEDKA Vodka, Casa Noble Tequila and High West Whiskey.

The company’s fundamentals are strong! As of the most recent quarter, the company’s market cap is $42.57 billion with a forward P/E ratio of 23.57 (A good sign; level P/E ratios common in mature industries like this; Beta of -0.01) compared to an alcoholic beverage sector average of 23.27 and an S&P 500 average of 23.28. Their revenue amount to $7.46 Billion. Organic net sales rose 8% to $2.07 Billion, beer segment sales increase 12.8% to 1.38 Billion, wine and spirits sales fell 11.7% to 705.6 Million, and they improved adjusted earnings guidance to $8.25-$8.40 per share from $7.90-$8.10. This is their 12th straight earnings beat and 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement (40% increase at $2.47 per share). So how does STZ square up to competitors? For this analysis, I will be looking at Constellation Brands (STZ), Diageo (DEO), Brown-Foreman (BF-B), Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), and The Boston Beer Company (SAM). I will also very briefly mention Campari (CPR-MI), Remy Cointreau (RCO-PA), and Pernod Ricard (RI-PA) for further comparison within the industry.

Constellation Brands is most efficient in its operations, effective in management, and consistent in performance. Let’s first look at each company’s revenue per employee (independent variable) and operating margin (dependent variable) …

STZ: Revenue per Employee - $828,418 Feb 28, 2017 (Operating Margin = 33.76% August 31st, 2017)
DEO: Revenue per Employee - $489,858 June 30, 2017 (Operating Margin = 29.50% June 30th, 2017)
BF-B: Revenue per Employee - $630315 April 30, 2017 (Operating Margin = 33.34% July 31st, 2017)
TAP: Revenue per Employee - $368679 December 31, 2016 (Operating Margin = 36.60% September 30, 2017)
BUD: Revenue per Employee - $258,383 December 31, 2016 (Operating Margin = 28.92% September 30, 2017)
SAM: Revenue per Employee - $617,890 December 31, 2016 (Operating Margin = 15.43% September 30, 2017)

Source: Y Charts


Although TAP’s operating margin is superior to the rest of its competitors with data given so far, STZ maintains the lead in terms of superior operating margins in correlation with revenue per employee (BF-B comes close but revenue per employee falls short while SAM’s operating margin is the worst in comparison even though revenue per employee is close to that of BF-B). This illustrates that STZ’s labor and operations efficiency is the highest. It is worth noting that operating margins for Campari, Remy Cointreau, and Pernod Ricard also fall short of STZ and even that of BF-B so these are not in consideration (especially taking into account that they trade on European Stock Exchanges and are subject to currency exchange risk; DEO is subject to these risks as well but the security is traded on US stock exchanges).  

Let’s now look at revenue and earnings of each company…

Constellation Brands (STZ)
2015 - Revenue: 6.03 Billion, Earnings: 839.30 Million
2016 - Revenue: 6.55 Billion, Earnings: 1.05 Billion
2017 - Revenue: 7.33 Billion, Earnings: 1.54 Billion

Diageo (DEO)
2015: Revenue: 17.01 Billion, Earnings: 3.88 Billion
2016: Revenue: 14.02 Billion, Earnings: 3.16 Billion
2017: Revenue: 15.65 Billion, Earnings: 3.60 Billion

Brown-Foreman Corporation (BF-B)
2015: Revenue: 3.13 Billion, Earnings: 684 Million
2016: Revenue: 3.09 Billion, Earnings: 1.07 Billion
2017: Revenue: 2.99 Billion, Earnings: 669 Million

Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP)
2014: Revenue: 4.15 Billion, Earnings: 514 Million
2015: Revenue: 3.57 Billion, Earnings: 359.50 Million
2016: Revenue: 4.89 Billion, Earnings: 1.98 Billion

Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)
2014: Revenue: 47.06 Billion, Earnings: 9.22 Billion
2015: Revenue: 43.60 Billion, Earnings: 8.27 Billion
2016: Revenue: 45.52 Billion, Earnings: 1.24 Billion

The Boston Beer Company (SAM)
2014: Revenue: 903.01 Million, Earnings: 90.74 Million
2015: Revenue: 959.93 Million, Earnings: 98.41 Million
2016: Revenue: 906.45 Million, Earnings: 87.35 Million

Source: Yahoo Finance


The only company to maintain a consecutive uptrend in BOTH revenues and earnings is STZ. In fact, in the past five years, STZ's stock price has failed to increase, per quarter, only three times. TAP is the only company on the list that ends up at a higher revenue and earnings level compared to the first year but considering that it has no consecutive earnings beats compared to STZ whose beat earnings 12 times in a row, consistency comes into question. 

Finally, let’s look at 5-year stock performance…

STZ: 518.39%
DEO: 16.94%
BF-B: 67.68%
BUD: 33.64%
TAP: 92.16%
SAM: 57.30%
RI-PA: 48.92%

Source: Y Charts


Evidently, Constellation continues to outperform all its competitors for the past five years and beyond. Many comparisons between STZ have been made against DEO and BF-B but from the data above, DEO seems to be sluggish and inefficient based on its operating margins and revenue per employee while BF-B, although a close contender, lacks consistency in performance (BF-B's stock price has fallen eight times in a quarter-to-quarter comparison in the past five years). But what could explain STZ’s superior performance and growth?

Looking at the 10-year chart, STZ (excluding SAM) breaks out from the rest of the companies in comparison around 2013 with the pace quickening near the end of the 1st half of the year. Around that time, the company completed its acquisition of Grupo Modelo’s U.S. Beer Business from Anheuser-Busch InBev for approximately $4.75 Billion. The acquisition nearly doubled company sales and significantly increased EBIT alongside free cash flow, helping solidify Constellation's position as the #1 multi-category supplier for beer, wine and spirits in the U.S. at the time of the acquisition. Furthermore, Constellation entered the tequila game early with its acquisition of Casa Noble Tequila in 2014 for only $30 Million. Compare this with DEO’s later acquisition of George Clooney’s Casamigos Tequila brand (respectable brand but not on the level of Casa Noble and a little late not to mention expensive; makes STZ’s tequila play a massive bargain in comparison) for approximately $1 Billion earlier this year and one can see why STZ is where it is now. These are arguably pivotal moments in the company’s history as their blockbuster Corona franchise is America’s best-selling premium import and the company alone was responsible for the 60% of the growth in the high-end beer category last quarter (this segment expanded by 9% over the past six months). Furthermore, Modelo, not Corona, led the beer portfolio higher by posting a 20% spike in consumption for the last quarter.

There is reason for concern when considering their wine and spirits segments, however, and recent acquisitions in the craft beer space. According to the company, wine and spirits sales fell 11.7% to 705.6 Million which is worrying especially considering the company’s recent acquisitions of Charles Smith and Prisoner wine brands. These acquisitions are further put into question with the acquisition of Ballast Point in 2015 for $1 Billion and expansion into craft beers (to make matters worse, the company alongside others making similar moves such as BUD are facing negative sentiment from the craft beer community). For example, after BUD’s purchase of Wicked Weed Brewing, many brewpubs and craft beer festivals cut ties. Furthermore, negative trends in the craft beer space led STZ to take a $86.8 Million impairment charge on the Ballast Point’s trademark value to $136 Million and the need to further write down the value more and more could grow. In other words, it looks like the company overpaid for Ballast Point, especially considering that the acquisition of Grupo Modelo only a few years ago cost approximately $4.75 Billion and the return on that investment has proven life-changing for STZ. However, despite these facts, the fact that Charles Smith alongside other new brand launches including Buddha Funky Brewery, acquired this past August, helped contribute to the most recent earnings beat and raised the bottom line is encouraging. Regarding their acquisitions in the craft beer space, although the price tag for Ballast was a little high, the move marks STZ’s overall strides to expand their presence in the high-end beer market and although their focus should be more on Corona, etc., this seems to have been a necessary move. Acquisitions to fuel strategic growth is a strong characteristic of the company and so far, they have been making the right moves for the most part and will do so going forward. But what is there to prove that they are making the right moves? Their debt-management. 

A major concern for the company is their debt load and just recently, STZ priced in $2 billion in new debt as of Oct 31st, 2017 which closed on November 7th. So evidently, debt-management comes into question. Okay, so at first glance the debt situation looks bad but let's dig a little deeper...

So, although STZ's debt is rising, their debt-to-equity ratio is decreasing. Back in 2015 around the beginning of the second half, it was about 1.224 and now it's resting at about 1.129. In short, their equity is rising faster than their debt can keep pace and instead of focusing on dividends and distributions back to shareholders, they're keeping profits on the balance sheet. And their management under Rob Sands is excellent so these profits are getting reinvested to fuel smart and strategic expansion of potential economic profits. The style of debt they're using is old-fashioned, but it is working for them. The share price is a testament to this superb management and a result of the company putting its profits to work. Take another look below…

2015: Net Margin % - 13.92% | Financial Leverage - 2.62 | Return on Equity 15.61%
2016: Net Margin % - 16.11% | Financial Leverage - 2.59 | Return on Equity 17.11%
2017: Net Margin % - 20.94% | Financial Leverage - 2.70 | Return on Equity 22.83%

Source: Edgar Online Database


The reason for the overwhelming rise in equity is due to improving net income margins. While many companies are achieving this at the expense of increasing leverage and thereby risk, STZ has made improvements in the right areas. According to the data above, financial leverage for STZ increased by just 3% in three years and was not a significant contributor to the increase in return on equity. Compare this with its peers and STZ’s results look even more impressive. For instance, in the case of Anheuser-Busch (BUD), the return on equities has dipped despite an increase in leverage and risk. Therefore, excess returns from higher return on equity with minimal increases in risk (leverage), when peers are failing to do that, should support further expansion in STZ's earnings multiple. So, knowing the story behind this debt alleviates any concern regarding the company’s debt and, in fact, recent news of more debt is encouraging with management intact.

Now that the case for STZ against its competitors is made, let’s evaluate the intrinsic value of the company. For this analysis, a discount rate of 8.49%
5 Year Cash Flow Forecast


Levered FCF (USD, Millions)
2017 - $776.90 (PV $716.08)
2018 - $901.10 (PV $765.53)
2019 - $1,520.55 (PV $1,190.65)
2020 - $1,848.81 (PV $1,334.35)
2021 - $2,145.00 (PV $1,426.92)
Discounted (@ 8.49%)

Present value of next 5 years cash flows: $5,434

Terminal Value

Terminal Value = FCF2021 × (1 + g) ÷ (Discount Rate – g)
Terminal Value = $2,145 × (1 + 2.47%) ÷ (8.49% – 2.47%)
Terminal value based on the Perpetuity Method where growth (g) = 2.47%: $36,487
Present value of terminal value: $24,272

Equity Value

Equity Value (Total value) = Present value of next 5 years cash flows + terminal value
$29,706 = $5,434 + $24,272

Value = Total value / Shares Outstanding ($29,706 / 172)

Discount to Share Price
Value per share: 
$172.71

Estimate of Discount Rate

The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 8.49% = 2.47% + (0.8 * 7.53%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta

The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm). Note the market value of equity is used not the book value ($43,044,787,154).

Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))
0.608 = 0.531 (1 + (1- 30%) (20.79%))
Levered Beta used in calculation = 0.8


It is important to note that any type of DCF calculation is subject to significant variance depending on discount rate and growth rate. The discount rate is based on the cost of equity since the perspective is from the viewpoint of a potential investor so cost of capital (Weighed Average Cost of Capital/WACC), which accounts for debt, is not used. So clearly the intrinsic value is not up to par with my bull thesis of the stock. In fact, for the past two years I’ve been analyzing the stock, the DCF model has concluded STZ is overvalued yet the stock has continued to climb. I believe this is the case because DCF is a highly quantitative technique and therefore does not fully reflect changes in non-financial information. The company is simply making too many moves that the valuation can never keep up and full current potential is not being realized. So, what does the company have going for itself moving forward that is justifying further upside?

First, CEO Rob Sands makes it clear in the most recent earnings call that distribution growth is anything but at its highest potential due to retailors dedicating too much shelf space to low-margin, low-growth brands. Evidently, the velocity on STZ products are much higher than its competitors in terms of the high-end beer market and therefore the point Sands made in the call was that retailers are beginning to assign more shelf space to Constellation’s portfolio as they realize higher margins and growth can be unlocked, benefiting both sides. With that said, the full potential of STZ is yet to be realized implying further growth ahead.

Second, the company is beginning to reap the financial benefits from its multiyear investments aimed toward boosting Mexican brewery capacity and added efficiency to its glass production, spending which peaks over $1 Billion this year, as part of an $4-billion-plus total investment. Capital spending should slow significantly from here, though. Constellation Brands is expecting over $1 billion in annual free cash flow beginning next year, compared to the $775 million it expects to generate in fiscal 2017. That will result in larger amounts of free cash flow that can be directed toward bigger beer and wine brand acquisitions, accelerated share repurchases, and a rising dividend. This increase in growth and repurchasing of shares should point further upside while attracting more equity as the stock brings in more income investors with a higher dividend. 

Third, STZ announced plans to debut its newest additions to the Corona franchise this upcoming February: Corona Premier (domestic markets) and Familiar (all major Hispanic markets). This is an excellent move for two reasons: 1) 66% of net sales consisted of beer segment sales which increased 12.8% to 1.38 Billion with Mexican beers leading the charge behind this massive growth and therefore makes the focus on Mexican beers like Corona paramount, and 2) the company states that 55% to 60% of all beer sales occur during the first half of the year so the fact that the new beers will debut near the beginning of the first half is optimal. With the Corona franchise already exceeding expectations and test markets showing approval so far, expect further growth and dominance in the high-end beer market, arguably their strongest segment.

Fourth, a recent 9.9% stake purchase (~$195 million) in Canopy, a world-leading provider of medical marijuana is another effective and early move reminiscent of STZ’s moves into the high-end beer market through the Grupo Modelo acquisition and tequila through Casa Noble. Both those acquisitions have paid off immensely and no doubt this move into the weed industry will prove successful as well. And although this initial investment may seem small, the company has options to buy more shares at a later time. This move comes at a time when approximately 27% of beer drinkers have already substituted beer with cannabis while BUD and TAP are already trying to secure sole licensing rights in Nevada to distribute cannabis. The move by Constellation therefore is clearly an effort to secure Canadian distribution before legislation is passed requiring cannabis be sold and purchased through a government licensed distributor which would cost significantly more. But legalization is the trend with recreational marijuana already legalized seven states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Washington) alongside Washington, D.C. Increased legalization of recreational marijuana will equate to lower beer and spirits sales, so this is a smart move. The question of legalization is not “If” but “When” and soon, many if not all, of the other states will follow and the cannabis market is expected to hit a lofty $50 billion by 2026, according to Cowen. More importantly, Constellation is going to work with Canopy Growth to develop cannabis-based drinks for its customers who already purchase wine, beer and spirits made by the company. In states like Colorado where recreational use is legal, cannabis-based drinks are booming. By working with Canopy Growth, Constellation goes from a triple threat (beer, wine, spirits) to a quadruple threat. This investment should continue to fuel STZ’s growth as it enters a potentially explosive market in the coming years.

Finally, Senate Republicans are proposing significant excise tax reductions for wine, liquor, and beer. Only downside is it would only last two years, so the Republicans are proposing extensions (Would begin December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2019). This would be the first distilled spirits tax reduction since the Civil War if approved. Some examples of how reductions would work (Potential $130 million generated from this throughout the industry, will be reinvested back into businesses which is good for investors) …

Beer: $16/barrel – First 2,000,000 barrels, $18/barrel - 2,000,000+

Small brewers: $3.50/barrel - First 60,000 barrels, $16/barrel - 60,000+ 

Spirits: $2.70/gallon – First 100,000 gallons, $13.34/gallon – between 100,000 and 22,130,000 gallons, $13.50/gallon - 22,130,000+

Wines: $1.07/gallon -14% alcohol content, stronger wines increase with alcohol content, $13.50/gallon - 24% alcohol content (Sparkling wine at $3.40/gallon)
Increases lowest taxable increment of wine from 14% to 16% (Sparkling wine will be taxed in line with still wines)

Reduce Excise Taxes: $1/gallon – First 30,000 gallons (produced or imported), 90 cents/gallon - next 100,000 gallons, 53.5 cents/gallon - next 620,000 gallons

Source: CNN Money

Although this is more speculative and there is no guarantee that this proposal goes through, if these tax reductions are realized then the potential for additional upside would increase as this is not necessarily priced into the stock itself. To put this into perspective, STZ paid approximately $730.1 Million in excise taxes for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 so any savings that can be realized from excise taxes would be a boon to not only STZ but the alcoholic beverages industry. But under superior management and efficiency in operations, this tax relief should be of more benefit to STZ than its peers. 

I will not provide a price target as such is not in my nature to do so. And statistically, this stock would not count as an undervalued security as the relevant P/E and P/BV are not below 15 and 1.5, respectively. Furthermore, the DCF model shows that STZ is overvalued but considering all points mentioned and that the stock has continued to steadily rise over the years above its peers, I am expecting further upside fueled by its promising future growth prospects.

t3_7fsuzn,"Warren Buffett -- When I Was 25 (Forbes, 2012)","Article:

This article, by Warren Buffett, as told to Randall Lane, appears in the upcoming April issue of ForbesLife magazine, as part of its ""When I Was 25"" series.

By Warren Buffett

Benjamin Graham had been my idol ever since I read his book The Intelligent Investor. I had wanted to go to Columbia Business School because he was a professor there, and after I got out of Columbia, returned to Omaha, and started selling securities, I didn’t forget about him. Between 1951 and 1954, I made a pest of myself, sending him frequent securities ideas. Then I got a letter back: “Next time you’re in New York, come and see me.”

So there I went, and he offered me a job at Graham-Newman Corp., which he ran with Jerry Newman. Everyone says that A.W. Jones started the hedge fund industry, but Graham-Newman’s sister partnership, Newman and Graham, was actually an earlier fund. I moved to White Plains, New York, with my wife, Susie, who was four months pregnant, and my daughter. Every morning, I got on a train to Grand Central and went to work.

It was a short-lived position: The next year, when I was 25, Mr. Graham—that’s what I called him then—gave me a heads-up that he was going to retire. Actually, he did more than that: He offered me the chance to replace him, with Jerry’s son Mickey as the new senior partner and me as the new junior partner. It was a very tiny fund—$6 million or $7 million—but it was a famous fund.

This was a traumatic decision. Here was my chance to step into the shoes of my hero—I even named my first son Howard Graham Buffett. (Howard was for my father.) But I also wanted to come back to Omaha. I probably went to work for a month thinking every morning that I would tell Mr. Graham I was going to leave. But it was hard to do.

The thing is, when I got out of college, I had $9,800, but by the end of 1955, I was up to $127,000. I thought, I’ll go back to Omaha, take some college classes, and read a lot—I was going to retire! I figured we could live on $12,000 a year, and off my $127,000 asset base, I could easily make that. I told my wife, “Compound interest guarantees I’m going to get rich.”

My wife and kids went back to Omaha just ahead of me. I got in the car, and on my way west checked out companies I was interested in investing in. It was due diligence. I stopped in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, to visit the Jeddo-Highland Coal Company. I visited the Kalamazoo Stove & Furnace Company in Michigan, which was being liquidated. I went to see what the building looked like, what they had for sale. I went to Delaware, Ohio, to check out Greif Bros. Cooperage. (Who knows anything about cooperage anymore?) Its chairman met with me. I didn’t have appointments; I would just drop in. I found that people always talked to me. All these people helped me.

In Omaha, I rented a house at 5202 Underwood for $175 a month. I told my wife, “I’d be glad to buy a house, but that’s like a carpenter selling his toolkit.” I didn’t want to use up my capital.

I had no plans to start a partnership, or even have a job. I had no worries as long as I could operate on my own. I certainly did not want to sell securities to other people again. But by pure accident, seven people, including a few of my relatives, said to me, “You used to sell stocks, and we want you to tell us what to do with our money.” I replied, “I’m not going to do that again, but I’ll form a partnership like Ben and Jerry had, and if you want to join me, you can.” My father-in-law, my college roommate, his mother, my aunt Alice, my sister, my brother-in-law, and my lawyer all signed on. I also had my hundred dollars. That was the beginning—totally accidental.

When I formed that partnership, we had dinner, the seven of them plus me—I’m 99 percent sure it was at the Omaha Club. I bought a ledger for 49 cents, and they brought their checks. Before I took their money, I gave them a half sheet of paper that I had made carbons of—something I called the ground rules. I said, “There are two or four pages of partnership legal documents. Don’t worry about that. I’ll tell you what’s in it, and you won’t get any surprises.

“But these ground rules are the philosophy. If you are in tune with me, then let’s go. If you aren’t, I understand. I’m not going to tell you what we own or anything like that. I want to get bouquets when I deserve bouquets, and I want to get soft fruit thrown at me when I deserve it. But I don’t want fruit thrown at me if I’m down 5 percent, and the market’s down 15 percent—I’m going to think I deserve a bouquet for that.” We made everything clear, and they gave me their checks.

I did no solicitation, but more checks began coming from people I didn’t know. Back in New York, Graham-Newman was being liquidated. There was a college president up in Vermont, Homer Dodge, who had been invested with Graham, and he asked, “Ben, what should I do with my money?” Ben said, “Well, there’s this kid who used to work for me.…” So Dodge drove out to Omaha, to this rented house I lived in. I was 25, looked about 17, and acted like 12. He said, “What are you doing?” I said, “Here’s what I’m doing with my family, and I’ll do it with you.”

Although I had no idea, age 25 was a turning point. I was changing my life, setting up something that would turn into a fairly good-size partnership called Berkshire Hathaway. I wasn’t scared. I was doing something I liked, and I’m still doing it.

A prolonged bull market across stocks, bonds and credit has left a measure of average valuation at the highest since 1900, a condition that at some point is going to translate into pain for investors, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

“It has seldom been the case that equities, bonds and credit have been similarly expensive at the same time, only in the Roaring ’20s and the Golden ’50s,” Goldman Sachs International strategists including Christian Mueller-Glissman wrote in a note this week. “All good things must come to an end” and “there will be a bear market, eventually” they said.

As central banks cut back their quantitative easing, pushing up the premiums investors demand to hold longer-dated bonds, returns are “likely to be lower across assets” over the medium term, the analysts said. A second, less likely, scenario would involve “fast pain.” Stock and bond valuations would both get hit, with the mix depending on whether the trigger involved a negative growth shock, or a growth shock alongside an inflation pick-up.

“Elevated valuations increase the risk of draw-downs for the simple reason that there is less buffer to absorb shocks,” the strategists wrote. “The average valuation percentile across equity, bonds and credit in the U.S. is 90 percent, an all-time high.”

A portfolio of 60 percent S&P 500 Index stocks and 40 percent 10-year U.S. Treasuries generated a 7.1 percent inflation-adjusted return since 1985, Goldman calculated -- compared with 4.8 percent over the last century. The tech-bubble implosion and global financial crisis were the two taints to the record.

Low inflation has prevailed in the current period, just as it did alongside economic growth in the 1920s and 1950s, according to the Goldman report. “The worst outcome for 60/40 portfolios is high and rising inflation, which is when both bonds and equities suffer, even outside recessions.” An increase in policy rates triggered by price pressures “remains a key risk for multi-asset portfolios. Duration risk in bond markets is much higher this cycle,” they wrote.

In the Goldman strategists’ main scenario of lower but positive returns, investors should “stay invested and could even be lured to lever up.” They suggested putting more in equities, with their greater risk-adjusted returns, and scaling back duration in fixed income.",28,0.88,1511973046.0

I've just started in this subreddit and have begun with the resources in the sidebar.

One metric I'm interested in is the FCFF for a Canadian company called Fairfax Financial (from their 2016 report). I've calculated the quantity and want my process to be double checked.

 * I calculated their gross revenue:     9,299.60
 * And gross expenses (less interest): 9611.1
 * To arrive at EBIT:                           (311.5)

Added back in

* D&A:                                             191.7
* PP&E Expenditure                           (208.3)

Arriving at FCFF:                             (328.1)

Does this look like I'm moving in roughly the right direction? What I haven't done is added or removed any of their investing expenditures (stocks) which are considerable (on the order of $1.6B). I've also included a line item in gross revenue taking a $1.2B hit on unrealized losses on investments.

Would appreciate any criticisms.

t3_7h9hel,New formula I've found. Please give a comment.,"Hey everyone,

I think I found a new formula that tells me what the price of a stock **HAS TO BE** when the: earning, equity and dividend stays the same in the future. The formula is as follows:

Earnings per share * Equity per share / (earnings per share - dividend) = price.

I've based this formula on the PE ratio and another ratio. The other ratio is:
(Price - Equity per share) / Dividend.

These ratio's should be equal.
Price / earning per share = (Price - Equity per share) / Dividend.
Using algebra I came up with the first formula.

By comparing the calculated price of the first formula with the actual price, you can see if the price is over- or undervalued. When the actual price is bigger than the calculated price, it is overvalued. When the actual price is less than the calculated price, it is undervalued. Whenever you made a conclusion, you can research why it is over- or undervalued.

This method is not about calculating the value of the company. But this formula gives me good insight of the opinion of the market.

Overvalued: The market thinks that future: earnings, equity or dividend will be lower.
Overvalued: The market thinks that future: earnings, equity or dividend will be higher.

If you have any questions, please ask me.

t3_7hkl10,Query regarding page 456 of 'The Intelligent Investor',"Hello,

On page 456 of 'The Intelligent Investor' (Revised 1973 edition) Benjamin Graham is comparing H & R Block to Blue Bell as they were at the end of 1969. He says that Blue Bell was earning 2.5 times as much for its stock and that it had 5.5 times as much in tangible investment. 

I am confused as to how he gets these amounts. I calculated that H & R Block's EPS for the year was $6,380,000/5,426,000 (earnings for the year over the number of shares) = $1.18, whilst Blue Bell's EPS is given as $4.47 in table 18-4, which is 
3.79 times as much rather than 2.5 times (I don't know why H & R Block's EPS is given in the table as only up to October, where it is $0.51).

I assume 'tangible investment' refers to tangible assets rather than total book value. Blue Bell has 18.28 times as much book value per share ($34.54 compared to $1.89), but the tangible assets are not listed in the table so they cannot be compared by the reader.

I would be grateful if anyone would be kind enough to offer some feedback on what I wrote.",7,0.88,1512423124.0

t3_7hznbl,Updated Berkshire Valuation (@ new corp tax rate),"With Berkshire set to benefit a lot from the new corp tax rate, and a run up in the company's stock portfolio, I thought it might be interesting to revisit the valuation I posted a few months back. The stock is ~$198/share, so here's a quick breakdown of both sides of the Berkshire business: the cash and investments, and the wholly-owned operating subsidies. 

**1. Value of Cash & Investments**

* $66/share stocks
* $36/share cash (after taking out $20b for dry powder)
* $12/share KHC (marked to market)
* $11/share fixed income
* $1/share Pfds/Warrants
* *less* $10/share deferred tax (new rate)

= **$117/share book**

**2. Value of Operating Businesses** = $198 (current price) - $117 (cash & investments) = **$81/share**

* 2016 Earnings operating businesses earned $8.50, so implied multiple on the operating businesses is 9.5x. 
* This seems low, and I think it deserves a higher multiple, which in and of itself would give us a ~15% discount to current prices. 
* Then factor in if you think BRK will benefit further from lower taxes not just at their operating businesses, but also with their stock holdings. AAPL, WFC, BAC, AXP in particular will benefit. And then do you think the portfolio has more room to run? Berkshire's stock portfolio trades at 19x earnings, whereas the S&P is at 25. Maybe this says more about the market's valuation than Berkshire's, but I certainly wouldn't say Berkshire's stock portfolio is overvalued. 

**So let's call it $220/share - $240/share.**",39,0.92,1512581964.0

t3_7j6l9h,Why the huge dip in Argan (AGX)?,"Argan Inc. dipped about 25% over the past week after Q3 earnings release. They beat quarterly revenue and earnings expectations, and EBITDA/ EBIT even increased -- EPS decreased compared to the prior year because they had to pay a higher tax rate. Then the stock dropped 25% which I don't really understand.

The only plausible reasons I can think of are 
1) The backlog has dropped by half over the past year and they haven't added any significant projects. However, they still have 500 million$ in contracts left and aren't expected to be done by mid-late 2018. Additionally industry conditions are pretty strong, so this seems like a bit of an overreaction. 

2) Negative FCF for this quarter -- this is because of how the payments work and the fact that they collect cash payments before a job, but only record the earnings in the quarter where they collect. Again, this is plausible but doesn't seem like a reasonable explanation.

Is this giant market overreaction or am I missing something huge? This company now has an EV of ~400 million $ and TTM net income of ~ 80 million $. It's in a solid industry, and market conditions seem ripe. ",2,0.67,1513037242.0

t3_7jldbo,Math/analysis question - How much leverage is counterproductive?,"Let's say I want to invest in options. Assume that i'm investing in something which has a positive average return, like call options; i.e. their expected value at termination is greater than their current price (because they're covariant with the market)
Suppose I have $1000. If I buy only a dollar's worth of call options, I can lose at most 1 dollar. This means my returns distribution is never zero and I can take the log to look at it as a geometric distribution; if I can do that I can fruitfully analyze what happens if I make this bet 100 times in a row. Because for small magnitudes the arithmetic and geometric means are very close i can assume they're both positive.

But if I spend all my money on call options, there's a nonzero chance that it will all go to zero. This means the log is undefined and makes the geometric distribution impossible (which makes sense because if you bet on call options 100 times in a row it's near certain that the bet would be zero at one point, which would wipe you out)

It follows that there's a spectrum of how much of my 1000$ i can devote to options and the expected geometric return is bell shaped like the Laffer curve.

Ignoring for the moment the question of ""risk"" as in standard deviation / volatility, how can I figure out how much of my profile I should devote to options to maximize expected geometric return or log return? Obviously if we were in the pure mathematics world we could solve this analytically if we were given a formula for the return curves etc. But in the real world how would I practically begin to tackle this problem? How would I estimate the expected return on something like call options in order to construct a distribution? (I tried using implied volatility to calculate this but I'm worried that would be circular logic)

The same question applies to something like investing in a leveraged S&P fund. If we just multiply the daily returns by a factor of 5 or 10 at some point we will start to lose more money than we gain because the volatility will eat away all our gains.",6,0.8,1513190951.0

There's no specific risk since as investors, we're supposed to have diversified portfolio which should reduce (or ultimately eliminate) the specific risk factors.

Okay, I get the logic here. But when we do a research on a company for a potential stock investment, what we really trying to do is finding the competitive advantages that separate this particular firm to the rest. These differences, to me, are that specific factor in the CAPM/APT models.
 1. So if we apply the CAPM/APT in the Cost of Equity model to obtain the final Cost of Capital, we're just supposed to ignore totally that crucial aspect of the firm? What's the point of identifying the ""X factors"" in that situation other than to forecast growth/Cash Flows?

I've been watching stock pitches, studying pitch decks, and learning about different statistical ratios as well. Ultimately, I want to develop my own framework for understanding the economic environment and financially evaluating companies.
I want to hear about the lessons you've learned after participating in the market, particularly in choosing stocks to invest in. In addition, I'd love to pitch various companies and hear feedback - I would greatly appreciate such an opportunity. I don't know much right now and I have much to learn, but this is also what excites me so much.

A little about myself: HYP grad, decent Excel background, have done previous coursework in basic economics, intermediate statistics, systems thinking, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra. Closely follow world events and news (favorite one right now is MBS/Saudi Arabia). Going to do consulting for the next 2-4 years while studying for CFA, MBA after that, then hopefully private equity or asset management afterwards. I want to see my parents rest after spending their lives working endless hours to make ends meet. That's the other big motivating factor for me in addition to my genuine interest in business and in the stock market.

I'm currently doing an undergrad degree in Biochemistry at a target uni, however, I've been set for investment management as a career choice for a few years now. The reason why I'm doing Biochemistry is a long story, but I would be more than willing to share it if it is needed.

My question is: is difficult to break into AM with a non-heavily quantitative degree, such as Biochemistry?

If it is, what steps should I take to improve my chances? (I'm currently studying towards an IMC, and do a lot work relevant to modeling, investment research)

t3_7mq6ic,Tix Corporation - a micro cap value play not possible for big investors,"Hey All,

I strumbled upon Tix Corporation in one of my recent screens. For many years pre-crisis they did not earn a net income. Since 2012 that changed for the better - or at least positive territory. This company sells tickets on discount for same-day shows and restaurants in Las Vegas. Current market cap is 6.2 mUSD.

As of 3Q 2017 they had 5,844,000 in current assets, mostly cash. Office equipment, furniture and lease improvements totaled 3,792,000 before depreciation in the 2016 annual report. And they had a Deferred Tax Asset of 10,220,000 hence allowing them to lower future tax payments. On the liability side is mostly current liabilities of 1,701,000 and a Deferred rent obligations of 17,000.

A back of the enveloped a 50 % discount to PP&E, taking cash at face value and liabilities at face value while applying a 15 % discount rate to the tax asset to estimate present value yields a estimated reproduction value-based NAV of 14,925,956 USD. It is hence selling at a discount of around 58 to reproduction value as defined by Calandros wonderful book ""Applied Value Investing"".

In April 2015 they decided to pay regular quarterly dividend, which seemed to have been ""left out"" in the third quarter. MGM Resorts International decided in the third quarter to open their own booth and hence Tix cannot sell tickets for the Cirque du Soleil. They recently launched a online platform to mitigate the decrease in tickets sold. They seem keen on utilizing the NOL and realize the value of it. 

Is it overlooked because bigger investors have difficulties in establishing a meaningful allocation and hence the value not ""corrected""? This is from their annual report ""In general,
an ownership change would occur if the Company’s ""5-percent shareholders,"" as defined under Section 382, collectively increase their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period."".

the mgmt fee of 2% would be easy enough, you take 1/12th and each month deduct it from net assets

Q1

how is the performance fee paid? or rather when? is it taken from net assets and paid to the manager at the end of the year when the books are closed? 

if so, what about clients that may withdraw funds before year end? are they asked to pay retroactively? or is the fund closed for withdrawals until year end to not allow this circumvention? lockups are fairly common but usually they require a minimum of time to pass and then advance notice, say 1 or 2 quarters, so afaik that doesn't clear up the issue of performance fee ""circumvention"". so what am I missing?

Q2 

also, for funds which the managers have invested their own money, do they receive the same 2/20 fees? it would seem to be a case of ""double dipping"" if they do, would it not?

Imagine 5 years from now, inflation becomes the biggest risk to equities (remember, this happened in the 80's). In that circumstance, which businesses would you want to own?

Here are a few examples that come to mind:

1. % attached businesses: Companies that charge a percentage take rate are less at risk because their revenue automatically resets upward with  inflation. Examples: American Express/Visa/MasterCard, OTAs, eBay, etc

2. Companies with core assets bought in yesterday's dollars, paid by customers in today's dollars. Buffett uses the example of a bridge that was built years ago but with a toll price that can be adjusted for inflation.

t3_7ne6vw,How do you value cash holdings?,"Theoretically, you can just add Net Cash to calculated operating value but i think it's insufficient.  
&nbsp;  
For the debt, as long as a firm can earn more than interest. it's okay except excessive amount that might hurt the sustainability of the financial structure. i think it's why we don't deduct Net Debt from operating value unlike Net Cash case.  
&nbsp;  
But for the cash, the logic implied in people do not discounting cash is that cash doesn't have any risk. that's why people simply add it to operating value in all cases whether the firm is great business or not. here's the point that i want to argue.  
&nbsp;  
Let's say you can invest to an equity investor rather than equity directly. and there are three people that has same amount of cash. say $10,000 per person. and your required return is 10%.

- A : has 5% per year track record.  
- B : has 10% per year track record.  
- C : has 20% per year track record the warren buffett.
  
Now, the question is that how would you value their cash? same $10,000 for all as you do when valuing equities? i've struggled last year and my friend earned decent money which made big gap between us though we had same amount of money at the beginning. this made me to realize that cash holding is also could be risky when the holder is poorly employing it. the Capital Allocation what buffett says.    
&nbsp;  
Even if a firm has large amount of cash. we should discount them if they don't employ it efficiently. it can happen even in good business because good business doesn't also mean that have unlimited opportunity to employ capitals. it's my 2cents. what are your thoughts on it?",7,0.71,1514795711.0

I'm am looking for a some help on understanding the implication of the Acceleration Clause of a Loan or Security (In my case an MBS).

My basic understanding of this, is that this (MBS) has an occurance of default, this Acceleration Clause can be triggered, which would ""declare the principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, of all of the Notes to be immediately due and payable."" Holy crap - does this mean all the underlying debtors are required to pay off the entirety of their loan? If my mortgage loan was rolled into this deal, would I need to pay of my house immediately?

t3_7odcrm,Thoughts on $FRAN?,"Francesca's has taken a beating over the past year and dropped an additional ~20% today after lowering Q4 2017 guidance.

* EV/EBIT - 4.53 (industry median is 14.64)

* ROIC - 43.17 (industry median is 13.48)

* No debt

* Price to cash is relatively low (14.2)

They've been crushed because of declining revenue/earnings in 2017. Amazon obviously plays a role in the stock's decline as well as people are assuming brick and mortar retail has no future. Their company headquarters is in Houston, TX and Hurricane Harvey shut them down for a solid 2 weeks in Q3 (including their E-commerce distribution). There has been high turnover in management over the years and they seem to be having difficulty with their product line this year. 

I do like the current CEO though. He seems very honest about the situation and is accepting blame for the company's failures. I really like that he is consolidating the store's product line in order to focus more on their core customer (women in their 20s). I think it's dangerous when companies try to do ""too much"" and I think Francesca's has had that mistake, but they seem to be on a path to fixing that.

The question is how to treat securitized debt associated with the FinCo when valuing a company - should it be treated the same as regular debt, and hence deducted from enterprise value to derive equity value in a DCF? (or added to enterprise value in the case where enterprise value is derived from equity value).

Inevitably there is a fairly high delinquency rate and this is what I am trying to dig into. 

The difficulty I am having, and I believe this is almost entirely an accounting question, is how the bad debt expense and impairment losses are aligned between the income statement and balance sheet. From what I've read so far, the bad debt expense should = the impairments losses recognised (I.E estimated), with the actual (cash) adjustments occurring via the sums being written off. However this doesn't appear to be the case, so can someone please explain why the Bad Debt Expense and the Impairment Recognised figures do not match? All the figures have been taken from ARs. 

And given that bad debt expense has, cumulatively speaking, far exceeded the sums written off, where has the difference gone as it surely would have had to show up in the cash flow statement?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! (Image attached for reference)

t3_7palqy,Should non-professional Value Investors leave stock picking to the pros (or just invest in a low cost broad market fund)?,"I have been reading about Value Investing for over a decade and put some serious money behind my analyses over the past few years.  I've had some success but a side of me wonders if this is just dumb luck and if I should just invest in a low cost index fund.  Thinking about both sides here:

Value investors would claim that there is a misalignment of incentives amongst the professionals.  They would claim that professional investors are more concerned with fees than performance.  Additionally, the clients that the professionals have can be fickle and will not put up with short term losses despite the professional having a sound investing rationale.  As a result, there are opportunities to profit when the market misprices a security and the professionals miss the error.

On the flip side, Wall Street has buildings of people whose full-time job is to evaluate securities.  These people are well trained in performing security analysis and understanding the markets, and have resources that most non-professionals wouldn't have (ex. Bloomberg terminals, large financial data sets, access to management, etc).  While most can agree that the markets are not purely efficient, trying to find and profit from the inefficiencies is difficult because you are competing with professionals who are trying to do the same.

All that said, I would like to pose the following two questions to the group:

Is it reasonable to expect a non-professional value investor to do well (ex. beat the S&P 500) provided the value investor:

* have a sufficient margin of safety
* invest in what they know
* act rationally
* remain disciplined
* have patience
* do a decent amount of research and due diligence


Are there any non-professionals here who have beaten the market over the long haul?  If so, how do you know that it wasn't dumb luck or a rising tide that lifted all boats?

t3_7p8dzh,Why I think Oil producers will outperform in 2018.,"I think these two videos sum up why oil is heading higher over the next 2 years:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67dd6ID2FAk&t=2s

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo7APGJbfF4&t=5s

They're a couple of months old but the thesis is still on track. 

Main points in my own mind being:

1) The market is currently under supplied as shown by rapidly falling global inventories and US inventories.

2) We're approaching normalized inventory levels and are on track to hitting those levels by around Q3 of this year (from when oil was $100 a barrel). Not saying we get to $100 a barrel oil but even $70 would be a big jump with the way oil producers are being valued.

3) Shale oil growth is constrained for a number of reasons. It has a very high decline rate of 70% for the first year of production so you need to drill more wells every year just to make up for declines in previous years. There are capacity constraints in terms of pipelines, fracking sand, well pumps that need to be available to grow production which, will require higher margins for servicing companies who have been squeezed hard. Most importantly, there's a big question around availability of tier 1 acreage and how many spots are available before the economics drastically decline for shale oil. I still think shale grows in a big way next year but I don't think it's capable of increasing production at will as some analyst would imply.

4) OPEC and Russia want higher oil prices. Several OPEC members don't have the capacity to increase production or are rapidly declining (Venezuela, Algeria, Angola). The ones who can increase production are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and UAE but they're in no rush as they already have a huge base and generally benefit the most from oil quotas. Saudi Aramco IPO also plays into this. Same basic premise for Russia which needs to get their economy back on track for 2018 elections. All in all the 1.8 million barrel ""cuts"" is closer to 1 million in reality and unlikely to be rapidly reversed.

https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-01-07/don-t-expect-opec-s-oil-output-deal-to-collapse-in-2018

https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/OPEC-Wont-Compensate-For-Small-Supply-Outages.html

5) The rest of the world outside of OPEC and USA/Canada make up about 40% of global oil production and most of that is offshore or oil sands. These are basically considered the highest cost methods of production and they have the longest lead times to produce once an investment decision is made. This means that when oil prices fell in 2014 new projects kept coming online in a big way. 2018 is the last year for major projects coming online from before oil prices fell. Moving into 2019 and forward you're going to start seeing very large declines at around 5% a year. 2019 still has some smaller projects so total declines will be in the range of 1 million barrels but 2020 and forward you're looking at about 2 million barrels a year in declines that need to be replaced. 

6) Geopolitical risk in order of likelihood:

-Venezuela (imminent hard default or possible coup causes oil production to tank -1.8 million barrels per day)

-Iran (Sanctions are reinstated by the trump administration - 800,000 barrels per day)

-Libya (Upcoming elections causes civil war to resume - 950,000 barrels per day)

-Nigeria (Rebels reinstate bombing of pipelines - 500,000 barrels per day)

-Saudi Arabia (Houthis hit oil facility with missile - Unknown) 

-Middle East (Outside possibility for another regional war - Unknown) 

-Natural disasters, unforeseen events, terrorist attacks, etc. 

That's a lot of potential barrels that could disappear and suddenly we need all of OPECs withheld production just to avoid a massive deficit. I personally think Venezuela is just a matter of time.

http://www.argusmedia.com/news/article/?id=1603657

7) If world oil demand keeps growing at roughly 1-1.8 million barrels a year in demand that's a huge amount of additional oil that needs to be produced when you factor in global declines from 3-4 years of minimal capex and lack of spending on new oil discoveries. I think the tide really starts to turn in April/May when we have minimal builds in Q1 compared to historical averages. by end of Q3 we've drawn a huge amount of oil and people realize shale can't fill the void and look to OPEC. OPEC decides to slowly unwind their cuts in order to keep prices high as people notice that from 2019 onward world needs significantly higher oil production to fill years of low capex. Oil price spikes back to $100 a barrel in 2019 or 2020 assuming there isn't a global recession by that time.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-29/oil-discoveries-at-a-70-year-low-signal-a-supply-shortfall-ahead

The great thing about now is that oil stocks are priced like oil is going to head back down to $50 because that's what investors have come to expect. The main narrative is that shale oil will flood demand over $60 a barrel and most managers will buy into that until it becomes apparent there is a shortage. I like Canadian oil producers because they're the most beaten down due to recent pipeline issues with keystone and a lack of takeaway capacity. However, the differential will shrink because gulf refiners are set for heavy oil (Venezuela and rest of OPEC are primarily heavy and they're declining) and railway operators can soak up excess capacity until new pipelines come on in 2019. Heavy oil is also mostly fixed costs so while it has a higher break-even the variable cost is a lot lower than shale or conventional which provides operating leverage.

My top picks are Whitecap Energy, Gear Energy, and Baytex Energy from least risky to most risky. I think Whitecap and Gear are a reasonably safe bet to double over the next 2 years and Baytex could possibly go up 4X-8X. All of them are cash flow positive and have little near term liquidity issues. Baytex has a lot of debt but nothing due until 2021.

Although this is not about equity analysis it's invented by buffett. if you don't know about this indicator. read buffett's article on fortune (2001). he introduced it first time after the dot com bubble has collapsed. ~~remember he never warns in advance~~ he rarely talks about the whole market as you know. what he said on the article was.  
&nbsp;  
>On a macro basis, quantification doesn't have tobe complicated at all. Below is a chart, starting almost 80 years ago and really quite fundamental in what it says. The chart shows the market value of all publicly traded securities as a percentage of the country's business--that is, as a **percentage of GNP**. The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know. Still, it is probably the **best single measure** of where valuations stand at any given moment. And as you can see, nearly two years ago the ratio rose to an unprecedented level. That should have been a very strong warning signal.

Even though other variables such as interest rates that determines it has drastically changed. it still have some meaning if it's as high as the dot com bubble. so what do you think about it as buffett follower?

t3_7p2zop,Residual Accrued on Structured Products,"Hi, looking for a little help understanding a concept that has come across me.

I am seeing an issuer of structured products (ABS/CDO/ect) - is leaving residual accrued following a coupon payment date. What I mean, is the issuer will have - for example - $50,000 in accrued to pay out to it's investors. However, they will only pay off a portion of this. For this example, say they pay out $30,000 of the accrued, leaving $20,000 residual accrued. This means rather than totally resetting their accrued (going back to zero) they are starting the next accrual period with $20,000 which they then accrue more on top of. In fact, it seems that they have to not only continue to accrue at the current rate, but there is additional accrued being applied just to the residual accrued. 

My question is, why would they do this? I'm not seeing a clear reason as to why they wouldn't want to pay this all outright? Has anyone seen or heard of anything like this? Or know of any resources I could turn to? Any thoughts or follow up questions would be appreciated.

Thank you.",3,0.67,1515456165.0

t3_7qdmkt,Why Mortgage REITs Are Getting Clobbered?,"So I wanted to compile some data to help illustrate what is going on in the market that is resulting in mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts getting clobbered. 

For this particular analysis, I am focusing on [ORC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORC/). They recently announced a cut to the monthly dividend from 14cents a share per month to 11cents a share per month and the book value has gone down to $7.87. 

 That said, they have 44% of their market value in cash ($178.53 million). 

The past year has not been kind to buyers of MBS such as mortgage REITs like ORC. 

[ORC MBS Portfolio Characteristics](https://imgur.com/a/OIjuY)

As you can see from the image above:

Currently, ORC has a MBS portfolio of $4.36billion. The majority (67%) of their portfolio is in 30 year fixed rate MBS at $2.9billion. 

Of their $4.36billion portfolio, 59% of their portfolio is invested in Fannie Mae which is about $2.2billion. The other 39% is invested in Freddie Mac which is about $1.5billion. 

Before I continue, I want to explain how bond prices and yields work - typically bond prices and the yield of interest rates are inverse related. As bond prices drop, the interest rate yield (not the coupon interest rate) goes up and vice-a-versa. 

This information is important to know as next we are going to look at the 30 year mortgage interest rate for the past year. 

[30 year mortgage interest rate (2017)](https://imgur.com/a/mIbeX)

As you can see from this chart, in March 2017 the 30 year interest rate peaked at 4.33% and finished 2017 at 3.99% (it started 2017 at 4.09%). 

Given that the interest rate  virtually ended 2017 where it started, you'd expect the MBS prices to reflect this but they don't. In the following image, [Fannie Mae 30 Year 4.0 coupon](https://imgur.com/a/XvgYW) we can see that the price of the 30 year bond for Fannie Mae actually ended 2017 lower than it started. At the start of 2017, the bond price was at 105.33 but ended 2017 at 103.90. That is a price difference of 1.43. 

We also can see this when we look at the [Freddie Mac 30 year 4.0 coupon](https://imgur.com/a/Xkfv0). Here we can see that at the start of 2017, the price was at 105.19 but ended 2017 at 103.90. That is a price difference of 1.29. 

For the 30 year bond prices to be at 103.90, we would expect the 30 year mortgage interest rate to be at minimum 4.2% to 4.3%. Not 3.99%. 

The other factor that plays into all of this is the [Federal Reserve Funds Rate](https://imgur.com/a/XvgYW), here we can see that the Federal Reserve Funds rate started 2017 at .56% but ended 2017 at 1.3%. 

How does this impact mortgage REITs? 

Mortgage REIT's make money through the spread of borrowing money and the interest rate yield of the MBS they've invested in, when that spread narrows - it makes it harder for them to make money. As the spread grows, it gets easier for them to make money. Mortgage REIT's do engage in hedging via interest rate futures to help protect the downside.

My thoughts on the future: 

Something has to change, either bond prices go back up to reflect the interest rate yield or the interest rate yield goes up to reflect the bond prices. As soon as either one happens, mortgage REITs like ORC will stop being squeezed by the narrowing of the spread and will recover. Of course no one knows how long the current divergence will last.  

Disclosure: I am long ORC, I am a buy and hold investor compounding the dividends.  ",29,0.91,1515954988.0

t3_7qkivm,On the false dichotomy of growth vs value,"Is anyone else annoyed by the growth vs value framework?

All investing is 'value' investing. If you are not value investing you are speculating (nothing wrong with that, mind you).

The most seemingly 'expensive' companies relative to the broader market can still be dramatically underpriced (google, facebook, amazon, etc). 

Conversely, companies which seem 'cheap' relative to the broader market can often still be dramatically overpriced.

All profitable investing comes down to paying up less than NPV.

In order to form a good idea about the NPV you need to be making qualitative assessments about the *future* strength and prospects of the business.

A lot of these so called value investors with poor track records imo spend too much time analyzing past financial statements and looking backward than they do making assessments about where the business is actually going, i.e. skating to where the puck is currently instead of where it is going to land.

In other words, they are making the old mistake of prefering to pay a 'cheap' price for a mediocre (deteriorating) business instead of a 'fair' price for an exceptional (growing) business.

**P/E Ratio = Market price per share / EPS**

- The lower the better typically, means it's potentially undervalued, look for companies under 15

**P/S = market cap / revenue & P/B = market cap / (total assets – total liabilities)**

- Low P/B and P/S indicates a potentially undervalued stock

**Debt to Equity ratio = (long term + short term debt) / total shareholders' equity**

- Look for a ratio below 1?

**Enterprise value = market cap + short term and long debt - cash & equivalents** 

**Free Cash Flow**

- Operating cash flow = Cash flow from operations from CFS
- Free cash flow = operating cash flow - capex
- put it over sales to see the % change over the past ten years

**Return on Invested Capital**

- NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - .4)
- Invested capital = total assets - liabilities excluding debt
- ROIC = NOPAT / Invested capital
- Should consistently be over 15% in the past couple years?

**Return on Tangible Capital**

- Adjusted working capital = Current Assets excl. cash - current liabilities excl. debt
- Net fixed assets = PP&E with depreciation accounted for
- Tangible Capital Employed = adjusted working capital + net fixed assets
- Return on Tangible capital = EBIT / tangible capital employed
- Must consistently be over 20% over the past couple years

I'm just worried why the transaction was conducted at such a discount to the market value and what could the positive/negative explanations for this be.

Today FOSL is trading at 10.78.
At the time, October 7th, it was trading at about $9.00.

I entered my trade November 13, at $6.5952. I'm up 63%.
My basic case for FOSL is that it will not go bankrupt, and so you should keep buying while it is trading below book tangible value. The company is making operating profits and growing tangible book value despite a significant reduction in revenue due to changes in the fashion accessory landscape. Fossil is a dynamic company that has been public since 1993, and has never suffered an operating loss despite multiple recessions. 

The four reasons that the stock is trading below book value are (in no particular order):
1. Retail pessimism (cyclical retail decline compounded by fears of amazon)
2. Intangible write offs
3. New World Fossil initiative (improving operating margins)
4. Decline in revenues

I believe that none of these reasons justify a value below tangible book value.

Why is tangible book value the correct indicator to value FOSL? Because historically the tangible book value has been a solid indicator of a bottom for the company. Perhaps this is because a competitor can acquire the brand and inventory for a great price, so should the market. Tangible book has been rising since 2015. Ironically, when tangible book was dropping starting in 2011, the price didn't adjust accordingly. Price to tangible book has previously hit as high as 9 or 10, VERY high, and leaves no margin of safety.
I am not concerned about their debt position because they have a current ratio of over 2x during this recent down turn.
Current tangible book price is 11.37, today price to tangible book (PTB) is at 0.95. The two previous all time lows are, 1996 when PTB hit 1.56, and in 2009 it hit 1.10.

**I think FOSL is an overweight until it reaches $12.50 (1.10 PTB, 15% upside), even weight at $17.00 (1.56 PTB, 57% upside).**
Now, IF we see that FOSL is getting its groove back with an increase in annual revenues and profits, then this stock should be trading at least a 2x PTB ($22.74 at todays tangible book value), but this is a speculative position and I don't recommend this unless you have deep insight into the relevant retail trends, or you believe that FOSL is a brand that will survive and thrive over the next 5-10 years.
I personally have no idea what will happen to FOSL in the 5-10 year time frame, I will reduce my position at around $12.50, and consider exiting at around $15.00-17.00. I'm primarily looking for deterioration of tangible book value (or lack thereof). If FOSL does get its groove back, then this stock should be a good one to hold for decades.

At todays prices, my two other retail picks are:
FRAN - $6.17 - Current PTB is about 2x, I would be holding this until it reaches PTB of 3.25x ($10 price target, 62% upside.  Not trading below tangible book, but also has zero debt. Tangible book has been stable year after year. This is a profitable retailer in a niche market, net margins have declined to 5% inclusive of the impact of the hurricane which impacted its shops and distribution. 

BGFV - $6.15 - Tangible book per share of $9.27.  Despite all retail issues, tangible book per share has risen consistently every year, therefore I find it illogical that the stock should trade below tangible book value. Currently at 0.67 PTB, certain to return to the recent 0.85 PTB ($7.90), so overweight until $7.90, 28% return, I think the stock remains an overweight until it reaches previous multi-year PTB lows of 0.92 ($8.52). Overweight until 1x PTB, even weight until 1.25x PTB, and not very interested beyond 1.5x PTB. I find it hard to believe that BGFV will be a growth story in terms of revenues or margins, so I am not willing to hold it for more than a very modest PTB.

Other retailers that I have recently taken profits on are:
GNC - $3.31 entry, currently trading at $4.84. Company has a negative book value and has some major questions with its debt. If it passes its debt restructuring hurdle, then this company should return to a price north of $20, and if their China sales start to accelerate through 2018, then it can return to previous highs of $40-$60.
HIBB - $14.165 entry (0.90 PTB), currently trading at $25.50 (1.58 PTB). I've exited this position, but I think it is a buy until 2x PTB. (This is a very interesting stock because their current share buy back schedule implies a 100% return).

t3_7tf06j,Would shorting stocks for the purpose of reducing portfolio's beta/being market neutral be a bad idea?,"There have been a few threads on short selling recently, and overall the responses seem fairly negative on the topic.

I get some of this from forex trading, but the variety of uncorrelated bets I can take on in currencies seems limited in comparison to stock/stock spreads. The idea is similar to what Dalio has called the ""Holy Grail of investing"", 

""People think that the way that you do best is to have the best possible bets,"" Dalio said. ""The way that you do best is to have the best possible diversification. I learned that if I could have 10 or 15 uncorrelated bets, and they're all about the same return, that I could cut my risk by 75% or 85%,"" he added. That would mean that I would increase my return to risk ratio by a factor of five through diversification.""

In another interview, Dalio said that Bridgewater sees the opportunities for uncorrelated bets as virtually unlimited because of spreads. I admittedly don't have the skills for deep equity analysis yet, but I'm working, and I tend to be a fast learner.

t3_7ua5ij,Tool to find undervalued shipping companies,"Shipping is a really interesting industry and there are quite a few bargains (container, liquids, bulk all of it) to be found here. I've helped a developer who wanted to undertake a challenging project to develop a database that should make it very easy to pull up critical information for shipping investors. Not so much financial filing information (as there are many sites that do a great job) but fleet specific information. 

We have a very, very early iteration live right now. It includes:

-fleet value screener (screens 8 shipping companies fleet) 
-the screener then displays a fleet value based on customizable inputs on age and type of vessel. (not every vessel type is represented yet) 
-we've set values by default but all values should ultimately be customizable. This alllows you to set your valuation estimates for certain ship types by age and the screener will spit out the aggregated fleet values based on your inputs. When ultimately all 80+ shipping companies are included this allows a shipping investor to find the best prospects much more quickly and more accurately. 

It already took a lot of time and effort, especially by the developer Coen, but it needs a lot more time, money and effort to build out. 

I know you are all busy but please give it a test spin - it only takes a few minutes - and tell us whether you would pay $5-$10 per month for this sort of tool.

I pulled the Colonial Penn deal details mentioned in the article from some old 10-k’s

From 1991: on August 16, 1991, the Company acquired
     Colonial Penn Group, Inc. (""Colonial Penn"") for cash of approximately    $128,000,000

From 1997: During 1997, the Company sold its Colonial Penn insurance operations in
two separate transactions. In September 1997, the Company sold its life
insurance subsidiaries, Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company (""Colonial Penn
Life"") and Providential Life Insurance Company (""Providential Life"") and certain
related assets, including its health insurance operations (the ""Colonial Penn
Life Group""), to Conseco, Inc. (""Conseco"") for $460,000,000. The price consisted
of $400,000,000 in notes maturing on January 2, 2003 collateralized by
non-cancelable letters of credit and $60,000,000 in cash. As a result of the
sale, the Company reported a pre-tax gain of approximately $272,000,000. For
calendar year 1996, the operations sold, which principally consisted of the sale
of ""graded benefit life"" insurance policies through direct marketing and
agent-sold Medicare supplement insurance, accounted for revenues of
approximately $230,000,000 and pre-tax earnings of approximately $48,000,000.

      In November 1997, the Company sold the property and casualty business of
Colonial Penn Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (the ""Colonial Penn P&C
Group"") to General Electric Capital Corporation (""GECC"") for total cash
consideration of $1,018,100,000, plus $14,300,000 for retention of certain
employee benefit liabilities. As a result of the sale, the Company reported a
pre-tax gain of approximately $590,000,000. For calendar year 1996, the Colonial
Penn P&C Group, the primary business of which is providing private passenger
automobile insurance to the mature adult population through direct response

t3_7whu73,Combining AC-T with WJA-T - Currently own AC-T (Amateur - Please Criticize),"I currently hold Air Canada (AC-TO). The reason I’m looking at WJA is to combine my one Canadian Airline with its biggest competitor. AC has approx 1,500 daily departures, and WJA approximately 400. No other Canadian Airline has even 50 (Based on this list on wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_airlines_in_North_America). Not to mention the fact that whenever you book a flight in Canada Westjet and Air Canada are often the only options. These two positions will essentially give me exposure to the entire Canadian Airline industry. Canada is a growing Country, and that will only mean more people are going to be flying.

AC has a p/e of around 3, but forecasted to increase to a more realistic 8. WJA is at a 9 forcasted to remain about the same. Industry average is around 4 but this is inflated with AC having the majority of the market cap, and a P/E ratio expected to rise from 3 to 8 (Please correct me if that last line is wrong).

AC has a p/b ratio of 2 which is approximately the industry average, while WJA is at a p/b of 1.2.

Fundamentally, ignoring industry averages, WestJet has a great P/E and a great P/B. Furthermore, the industry averages are currently skewed by ACs great performance, and will be much closer to WestJet going forward.

Considering AC is a staple in my portfolio, is buying WJA the right thing to do? All indicators in my mind point to yes, but the analysts aren’t so hot. Is there something I am missing?",4,0.75,1518221428.0

I think practically it's working well for common cases. but i've noticed there's something in  common when my calculated intrinsic value is too low compared to market value. everytime i've encountered those situations were the cases where firms have excessive debt like more than 50% of total capital. the deviation is getting even bigger as firm has more debt. i know it should be the reason that lowers discount rate in perspective of WACC.

So i felt like my discount rate is too high. if my estimation for cash flow is same with the market. their reverse engineered (implied) discount rate is something like 3% or 4% which i feel uncomfortable. my question is that don't you encounter similar situations? and how do you deal with such debt driven company when you don't use WACC?",24,0.87,1518352007.0

t3_7xsj82,Cigar Butts of the Day: SSI and SMRT,"These stocks are on the radar for a dumpster diver looking to make 2x - 10x on their money.
These are 2 companies which I don't think will go bankrupt in 2018, they don't have the same bad marks that other department stores, like Bonton, or Sears, or JCP have had, namely, their losses are limited in time to relative crises (2008/2009, and 2017). And debt is manageable.

Both have positive cash flows from operations, unlike Bonton, Sears, JCP.
They barely have enough to keep up with depreciation, this is not good, so their stores will likely continue to deteriorate, but the in meantime, the companies can stay in business, and the stock price can recover.
I don't think there is true value, in the sense that you can easily liquidate the companies for a profit. But I think there is an opportunistic trade to be made based on overselling due to compounding real and perceived risks.


Using fundamental ratios to get to a price that I think the market will buy these companies in a slightly less distressed situation, I'm going to use the PS ratio, and look at the 2009 time period where we had a recession and both companies had uncharacteristic operating losses.

My data may not be accurate, all that I am using is my Gurufocus.com account, you should use Bloomberg or something more reliable.

SSI - Stage Stores Inc - Department Stores - $51m market cap, $1.81 share price. 
They bought out Gordons in bankruptcy, giving them access to an off-price market, a la Ross or TJMaxx. They have good access to credit lines and are not behind on any debts.

SSI, in 2009 traded at a low of 0.11 PS, had a range of between  0.17 - 0.49. 
It is currently trading at a PS of 0.03. I think there is at least a 3x upside from today's prices, even if the company continues to lose money in 2018, but if the company is not entering bankruptcy.

SMRT, in 2009 traded at a low of 0.04 PS, then had a range of 0.23 - 0.51.
It is currently trading at a PS of 0.02. I think there is a minimum of 100% upside from here assuming they do not go into bankruptcy, which is unlikely because of their positive cash flows from operations, and relatively low interest payments to operating cash flows.

For EITHER of these companies, if they return to profitability, you will see an expansion of the PS ratio back to the previous lows (non-2009 low).
SSI, from 0.03 -> 0.17 = 5x upside
SMRT, from 0.02 -> 0.23 = 11.5x upside

Some of you may hate my method of analysis, and these stocks are not healthy for a long term buy and hold portfolio. But considering the recent reactions to Retailers who show resilience, I think these are 2 stocks that show a substantial risk reward ratio.

t3_7y9xqc,Betting against Nvidia's monopoly on AI (NVDA),"Reposting a comment I made on another subreddit about Nvidia since I'm making a value argument against it.

=========================

Okay, no position in NVDA yet, but I plan on buying 2020 puts on it. They are way overvalued and too much future success has already been priced in. Why?

1.) Nvidia's pillar is AI in all its forms: data center training/inference, autonomous cars etc. Right now they are a monopoly charging monopoly prices. But their monopoly position will be aggressively challenged this year by Graphcore, AMD, Nervana (acquired by Intel), and Google's in-house TPU. Data center providers are still salty about Intel's monopoly on CPUs and will do all they can to avoid the same thing repeating with GPUs. We can already see that with Google's in-house level. I can only assume that AWS/MSFT are either doing something too or scoping out an AI chip startup to acquire (there are lots of those around). I doubt Nvidia will realize monopoly profits of the next two years that are already priced into the stock today.

2.) Look at Nvidia's revenue vs market cap. Now look at Intel's. Intel is actually a very similar company - most revenues come from selling to data centers (top top CPUs), to gamers (top CPUs) with some for personal computing (avg CPUs). Intel has had ZERO competition for years, only now is AMD a threat. For NVDA's revenue to market cap ratio to look like Intel's, its revenues would have to 5x (not an exact number, but you get the point). Highly unlikely to happen, especially due to new competition from point 1 above.

3.) Market will crash, most probably by 2020.

4.) Crypto will crash.

5.) Autonomous cars are decades away. Maybe California will have them within 10 years, MAYBE. The rest of America will take another 10 years with the rest of the world another 50 years after that.

I can elaborate more on the 1st point since I'm part of the deep learning community and that's kind of where I got that insight from, since my friends and I often talk about upcoming products from competitors since Nvidia GPUs are so damn expensive due to crypto.

As I said, I haven't taken a position yet since for the next few months I'll be liquidating my most of my current portfolio. At that time I will look to add Jan 2020 puts to my portfolio.... unless you convince me otherwise ;)

And if you sell, you have to keep disclosing until you go below 5%?

The reason I ask is one of our portfolio companies - we were told one of the larger shareholders has become a “price insensitive seller.” The company has already spoken to all of the 5%+ holders earlier and knows it’s not them. Besides if it was, they’d have to file updated 13G’s, and we’d know by then? So I’m guessing it’s someone under 5% but still significant enough to tank the price the way they have.

t3_7ytkf0,AviaAM Leasing Update,"A couple of months ago I posted a thesis here on a company called ""AviaAM Leasing AB"".  The full post is viewable [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/7j0aqz/long_thesis_aviaam_leasing_ab/).  

The prospects of these shares have changed considerably in the past week or so and definitely not for the better.  I'd just like to provide an update to the current situation, as I think the circumstances are somewhat unusual/interesting.

Last week, the company posted their full year 2017 financial statements, which were rather uneventful in and of themselves.  However, the real news from management was that a controlling group led by Zia Valda had increased their stake in the company to ~78%, and that they were initiating a squeeze-out process to eliminate all minority shareholders and take the company private.  Based on the regulations governing the Warsaw Stock Exchange, any majority holder owning over 90% of a security can compel the remaining 10% to surrender their shares for a set price, and any holder owning over 80% can delist the company from the exchange.  Zia Valda is essentially threatening minority shareholders with a delisting while using a tender offer to attempt to acquire their shares.  The real shot to the gut comes in the form of what Zia Valda is offering minority holders, as the 5.62/share price they have made in their offer is far less than the 6.36 print the stock closed at the day before, making this a complete take-under.  From everything I've read and from my correspondence with other investors, this price is surprisingly just about legal under Polish regulations, and Poland does not provide for the pursuit of appraisal rights.

Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this development.  My attitude towards these situations has always been ""hate the game, not the player"", but one can't help but feel angry at a manager who IPO'd a company at 8 PLN/share to raise capital in 2013, did such an abysmal job of IR that the company eroded to a fraction of its true intrinsic value, and then used their own incompetence as an opportunity to essentially steal the remaining shares they didn't already own at a price far less than they're really worth.  I can't imagine having owned this since the IPO in 2013 (or having bought it above 6 PLN the day before!)

For me, one failure in analysis I had was that I didn't realize that Mesotania Holdings was a Zia Valda affiliate (that paper trail went cold in Cyprus).  However, my main failure was my assumption that securities laws and regulations, despite their quirks, are largely similar across the western world.  Just in the last week, I've learned much about how minority shareholders are treated differently in Europe than in the United States, and I'll certainly be more aware of these nuances in the future.

As for AviaAM, one complication that may work in the favor of the minority holders is that the Company is based in Lithuania, not Poland.  From what I've been reading, Lithuania is far more minority owner-friendly than Poland is, especially regarding appraisal rights and minimum buyout offers.  I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out and how strong Zia Valda's hand may actually be.  My latest understanding is that they will be able to delist the company with 80% ownership, but won't be able to squeeze out at this offered price.  The tender offer doesn't close for a while, so I'm currently planning on waiting to see what announcements/lawsuits shake out from this.",10,0.86,1519104876.0

t3_7z1e2p,Anyone look at RAD?,"Read announcement today of buyout by Albertsons. Potential RAD arbitrage opportunity seemed intriguing on its face. Plus it seems like many burned by prior RAD/WBS merger may be scared away this time (pure speculation).

Two different ways of playing this:

1) play RAD merger spread
2) play ancillary players in this (i.e., Kimko)

I’ve only scratched surface on both these. For 2) I get the following:

Albertsons shares outstanding post-merger: 392,900,000

Implied Albertsons per share price: $23.16 ($1.83 cash divides by 0.079 shares)

Implied Albertsons value: $9,101,354,430
(as a check, this is within ballpark of announced $24B value, less the respective RAD and AB debt as of most recent 10-Q)

Kimko share of AB: 9.74%
Kimko value: $886,471,922
Kimko cost: $140,000,000
Kimko gain: $746,471,922

This looks like a substantial gain for Kimko. Presume it would have to pay tax on it (even though Kimko a REIT). Still that is something like $500M minimum gain.

t3_7zrosc,Compensation Policy and link to private market acquisition,"Hi all,

I know this post is (almost) completely unrelated to this sub, but I greatly admire the amount of brainpower here so maybe I get some leeway from our mods. I am an investor with the same philosophy & methodology as most of the members around here & I think it's fair to say that we spent a considerable amount of our time on researching 10Ks, the footnotes to financials and other intricate details.

One of those details is often management compensation to determine whether management is properly aligned with the business (low base salary, required stock investment, bonus compensation based on per share metrics or ROIC/IRR metrics and so on). 

I was wondering whether any of you ever encountered a compensation policy that you thought was very creative and/or very correct for both management and the company.

The reason I'm asking is because I am in the process of acquiring a small business with around EBITDA +/- 1 mn. I delivered a first indication of interest (with ballpark valuation based on the estimates for 2017) somewhere in December and further talks were on hold until the official 2017 results became available.

The actual results were +/- 20% below the forecasted results, this was mostly due to a lack of sufficient personnel, (it's a project based business), and when I channel check the existing backlog I can see that a higher % of work has been transferred to 2018 (so the projects are still there, they'll just happen later).

Of course, for me as buyer, the 20% lower EBITDA causes a significant penalisation in the company valuation (I am using a typical LBO financial structure for this transaction) and my talks with banks for acquisition financing etc will become slightly more difficult given the lower growth (it's a good thing I did not share any forecasted results with the banks).

For the seller however, it's much more difficult to comprehend that his business has become +/- 750k less worth over the span of a couple of months, especially as he sees the backlog which looks as healthy as ever. I very much understand his point of view and am now looking and thinking about creative ways of how I can structure a payoff for the 750k in ""value disappearance"" that will create some kind of win/win scenario for both parties.

My current offer already consists of him reinvesting around 15% in equity (with a predetermined takeout in 3-5 years), + he will extend a vendor loan as additional financing and receive an earnout after x years given certain targets.

Examples:

Structure an additional earnout on gross profit/EBITDA/realisation of certain projects but cash flow wise this is not very desirable
When taking out his equity, increase multiple paid determined by certain metrics (gross profit, EBITDA, ... ).
Use performance units linked to certain metrics which vest year after metrics are obtained?
...
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!

t3_7zydak,Wharton Restructuring and Distressed notes,"Had to leave before the last couple of sessions but got most of the good stuff. Also, I didn't bother taking notes on stuff one could dig up online or some non-financial stuff that I frankly couldn't pay attention to (like high-level biographical info about when they were kids).

**Jamie Dinan, York Capital** - basically opened with a story of his life, which he said he thought of like an ""option"" where the two most relevant factors are volatility and time. Did IB, then merger arb, then went to law school. Seeded York with $5MM he raised from ex-DLJ colleagues. 

Back then smart college grads went to Goldman and McKinsey, whereas asset management was still a backwater so it was easier to get noticed and climb the ladder if you put your mind to it. Building a reputation as a hard worker that said yes to everything as an analyst is what built his reputation and allowed him to raise money for his fund.

*On markets* - bullish because global economy is doing extraordinarily well. Investor class (pension funds, SWFs) growing richer. There will be a correction but not like before. IG bond market is ""behind the economy"" and yields are going higher. Expect volatility and uncertainty in the market over the next few months.

York runs 0.3-0.5 beta portfolios.

Likes energy because it's inefficient, lots of technological change. Retail is challenging, brick and mortars are here to stay but valuations are richly-priced, and there is excess gross margin in the industry that will get competed away. Malls are overbuilt, but York is long real estate where demographics are growing. Very suspicious of administered care industry (hospitals, nursing homes, etc) because of high capex and reliance on government reimbursements. Orphan drugs are good. Excess supply in the telecom industry that will drive down revenue.

Likes credit because ""machines can't do it,"" you have to be active and there's too much friction and opacity for automation.

Buying the Milwaukee Bucks was the most fun investment, but since buying them three years ago they've only broken even. Giannis is the nicest kid you'll ever meet.

**Dave Miller, Elliott Management** - Volatility that we saw in 2018 is due to the market determining what will happen economically. Late in the cycle, high likelihood of downturn in next couple of years (could be preceded by some false starts like we saw in early Feb). Broker-dealer and bank balance sheets have shrunk since '08, which could help explain why credit has lagged equity this last decade.

**Angelo Rufino, Brookfield Asset Management** - the opportunity is global; international restructurings are more inefficient and thus more profitable. Rule of law is key in this process. Brought up their participation in the restructuring of Brazilian telecom Oi and how it's challenging in that equity has disproportionate influence in a bankruptcy.

**Jon Zinman, Solus Alternative Asset Management** - Also brought up Oi, also mention subordination issues in Brazil where debt isn't necessarily made whole before equity gets something. Regulator coming and taking over would have been the worst outcome. Bought the debt so cheap that any resolution to the bankruptcy would have been profitable. Currently there's an issue because the judge on the case gave the OI CEO a lot of sway, and that's being contested.

Apparently Solus was on the losing end of the Hovnanian CDS trade. Didn't mention the the firm by name (it's BX), but basically said it's not proper that an investor can extend credit conditional upon a voluntary technical default. Solus is challenging this in court.

Largely stayed away from retail but just got involved in Toys R Us. Brick and mortar is in danger as Amazon currently is prioritizing putting competitors out of business vs. making a profit. Brands are important, you can monetize the IP at Toys. Real estate is a complicated issue there because Toys stores are under a master lease.

**Matt Kimble, Avenue Capital** - Energy is a great industry for distresed debt investing as there's lots of cycles. Invest in upstream because that's where the BKs are. Avenue likes the power sector in particular, which is facing difficulty because of oversupply and low nat gas prices. Regulations are a big deal in power.

**Matthew Bonanno, York Capital** - focused on the BKs of Samson and Linn Energy. Linn business model was doomed to failure from the beginning, bought the distressed unsecured bonds at 9 cents, lots of dry powder for energy PE but the big buyers in Dallas are really only experienced in dealing with clean assets where they can just buy and start drilling.

Upstream has a G&A problem, need to reduce administrative overhang through consolidation.

**Marc Lasry, Avenue Capital** - (moderator asked him the same questions as for Dinan) bullish on market because economy doing well globally. Trump is getting all the credit for reforms put in motion by Obama. Real risk is exogenous events, with the example that you'd want 500bps over treasuries for South Korean sovereign debt for geopolitical risk and etc, but you'd only get 10.

Bullish on energy, seeing large restructurings in services and power sectors. Retail is tough, if investing has to be in senior debt. Long healthcare. No opinion on telecom, not enough companies in trouble.

Active investing has underperformed over the last few years because hedging is expensive.

Then Lasry spends half an hour talking about shenanigans he got into with Bill Clinton and Bush. Says Clinton is the smartest person he ever met.

**Bruce Richards, Marathon Asset Management** - never been as much duration related to interest rates as there is today. The three main drivers of rates (Fed, inflation, supply/demand) are all pointing to higher rates.

Low likelihood of global recessions, expect sub 25% downturn in earnings for a future recession. Recessions are hard to predict, and economists have been predicting them happening every year since 2015. One will probably happen in next couple years but nothing says it has to, Australia hasn't had one in 30 years. American economy accelerating because of deregulations, tax cuts, lots of capex, prediciting 3% GDP growth.

$54B in distressed bonds currently vs. $100B in dry powder for distressed assets. Managers who raised funds in the last few years anticipating a recession are running out of time to deploy capital. 

Institutional investors are shifting towards private credit, 2011-2013 fund vintages have had ~13% returns whereas last three year vintages have had ~8% returns.

Banks starting to lend to the upper middle market so there will be more competition for the direct lenders and BDCs. Smaller companies are still too cumbersome for banks - and borrowers don't have to put up with stricter covenants if they can turn to alternative lenders.

BBB debt issues are exploding, currently half the IG market.

PR is going to be a key issue going forward (referenced the heat on Klarman for buying COFINA bonds).

Both his fund and Avenue Capital are raising seperate aircraft leasing funds.

For the first time in a long time, Marathon is favoring southern Europe over northen Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal but staying away from Greece). Mostly corporate loans and CRE loans where they could take over the real estate.

Berkshire was going to get a second tranche of equity but over 80% of shareholders voted against it stating that the company had stabilized and that they did not see the value of issuing more stock to Berkshire.

Since the fraud, the company cleaned house and has a new executive team, has had two quarters of profits, and has the backing of Berkshire Hathaway.  There are some lawsuits pending but most of the fines and regulatory issues are over.  In addition, the lawsuits, while not insignificant, would not make a big dent on the bottom line.

t3_80stu4,$CATO - Value Opportunity or Value Trap?,"Value Investors/Security Analyzers,

tl;dr $CATO is an intriguing value play that looks absurdly cheap on the surface. Would love to hear your thoughts. 

Looking to gauge opinions on Cato Fashions ($CATO). Like many stocks that end up being value plays, this company is clearly ‘diseased’ and out of fashion, but there appears to be no chance that it is terminally ill given lots of cash, zero debt, and positive cash flow (for now at least). Here is pertinent balance sheet and stock info (data from most recent 10Q/10K or recent stock price):

-	Recent Price: $11.50
-	Shares Outstanding (Class A): ~24M
-	Market Capitalization ~ $276M
-	Unrestricted cash and investments - $215M (~$9/share)
-	Interest-bearing debt - $0
-	Enterprise Value ~$60M

So what does $60M get you?:
(To put Enterprise Value in context, if you pay $276K for a house, and then find $215K cash inside the house, how much did you pay for the house? Answer: $61K) In FYE 1/28/17, the company had around $72M in operating cash flow and returned $77M to shareholders via dividends and buybacks (though some goes to ~2M Class B shares). If the company were to repeat this performance in FYE Jan 2018, then you’d be fully paid back in one year. Through 9 months, the company has operating cash flow of $38M and returned $61M to shareholders. If they are otherwise inept, at least management is prioritizing returning money to shareholders over value-destroying growth. 

Ugliness:
To be clear, things are not pretty for this company. I believe the last 24 months have seen negative Y/Y same store sales growth (double digit declines for much of this period). The stock has been hammered as a result. The really good news is that all stores are leased, and lease terms are less than 5 years. A competent management should be able to identify stores with negative contribution margins that don’t support the overall strategy (more on this later) and allow these leases to lapse/close down the store. Sure this will mean more impairment, but again, this doesn’t require cash outflows. 

Strategy, from my perspective: 
Low cost fashion retailer concentrated in the Southeastern US, specializing in plus-sized women’s clothing. Stores are in strip malls (ideally anchored by a Walmart). Stores also offer credit and layaway for purchases. Minimal online presence. 

Strategy, analysis (much of this is my conjecture):
The Southeast is one of the poorest, and thus least healthy regions of the US (forgive the generalizations from someone from the Northeast). The combination of layaway and plus-sized clothing appears to be a pretty solid match for the region. Target customers are also likely underrepresented as Amazon Prime customers, so e-commerce threat is perhaps a bit limited. Historically, high density of stores and geographic concentration has been the winning strategy for retailers (think how Walmart grew from its Midwest base). I can’t say with any confidence that this is a long-term viable retailer (i.e. 10 year horizon), but if management can’t strategically close its non-performing 1,000+ stores, there should be scope for cash flow to improve. 

Other positives:
-	13 year board member Daniel Stowe (North Carolina business owner) bought 9,500 shares in 2017 at ~$14. Insider purchases by long-time, local board members (i.e. not someone who flies in 2x a year to meet) are generally best positive predictors. 

Risks:
-	For some odd reason, this company bought an airplane in FYE Jan 2017 (long trips between Mississippi and Alabama?). This is scary, because it could be indicative that founder/CEO John Cato is a crook. He only owns 5% of Class A stock, but in total has 43% of voting power (I’m sure his cronies get his voting power over 50%). The saving grace here is Class A stock gets dividends first, so Cato will need to pay us if he’s going to pay himself. 
-	It seems like there is some financial engineering going on (credit https://seekingalpha.com/article/4139384-cato-corporation-remains-dangerous-value-trap). Somehow, this North Carolina, US retailer has $24M of unrepatriated cash outside the US. There was also a positive adjustment to gift card estimates which helped net income this year. Not hugely concerned, given that cash can’t lie, however, and the company has a clean audit opinion from PwC. 
-	This company is a real mess, and could be a value trap with inept management. 24 months of declining same store sales is brutal. If things don’t turn around, the company could start bleeding cash. 
-	While the credit/layaway business seems complementary to the strategy (and really helps profits), it could pose some risks, especially given geographic concentration.

Overall:
I am willing to take a flyer on the company, given very limited downside. In my view, you are paying $11.50 for a $9 bill, which also generates cash every year. I think somewhere in the $15-17 range is fair for this stock, which gives a pretty decent margin of safety. Please disagree and/or offer alternative perspectives. Forgive the long post.

Edit: In the interests of full disclosure, I've recently entered into a long position in CATO. Additionally, I'm taking Bruce Greenwald's 'Value Investing' class this semester, and am hoping to crowdsource some ideas on this stock, since my group will likely be using it as our case for the final project.

t3_80s7d2,GME has a few puffs left,"GameStop is very cheap on an earnings multiple basis and also a dying business that nobody wants to invest in. 

With their most recent 8-K, GameStop reaffirmed their guidance for 2018 EPS hitting around the middle of $3.10-$3.40, *without factoring in the tax bill*. GME pays an effective tax rate of 32%, and lowering this to a conservative estimate of 20% we can estimate EPS of $3.67-$4.03 with a midpoint of $3.85. I can't predict earnings, but the positive tailwinds of the continued shortage for Nintendo Switch and the success of newer Xbox One models make me optimistic, especially considering that GME gave this exact guidance range last year and cruised comfortably over the top.

GME has an AT&T-store business which I'm not too excited about, and I'm a bit worried that their guidance of $80-$95M operating contribution, about $10-$25M lower than 2016, is optimistic solely based on the fact that they have missed their estimates badly in the past. It makes some amount of sense that GME wants to leverage their SG&A by growing their footprint; good luck to them(it also makes their numbers look better, but they go into enough detail that you can figure out exactly what the impact is).

When you look at the core business, things amazingly don't look so bad. The used disc business represents the largest segment of gross profit contribution to the business, about 30% of gross profit. In 2016, GME managed to sell about $2.2B worth of used games, earning a $1B gross profit. Over the past 10 years, the most they ever sold was $2.6B of used games(in 2012), earning a $1.2B gross profit. In other words, over the past 6 years, GME has lost about $200M in gross profit and seen this segment decline less than 3% per annum while gross margins slid .3%. Over that same time frame, total gross profit in the core business has slid by about $174M, even after margin contribution of $200M or so from an entirely new segment, ""collectibles."" 

It's important to think about where we are in the console cycle, with the Nintendo Switch shortage driving foot traffic into the stores, and likely with it, sales of collectibles, accessories, exclusive offers, and new discs. Reduced console sales pushing down sales of their higher-margin goods like collectibles and accessories may be the greatest threat on the downside.

Factors on the upside include Xbox expanding backwards-compatibility for old games, which potentially increases the value of GME's inventory and drives resurgence in their used game business. In addition, collectibles are a bright spot and growing quickly, although still a small contributor to bottom line.

If you just chart net income for GME by year over the past 10 years, there's no major deterioration in earning power that's apparent; it looks pretty flat(it's helped by debt-financed acquisitions). EPS, on the other hand, is not far from all-time highs for the business, with the difference due to buybacks. GME has their dividend and interest payments fully covered by cash flow, and I'm not too worried. 

In summary, you have a stock trading at 4x forward earnings and 5x forward EV/EBIT, where it seems that the market is pricing in an imminent collapse of the business that I do not believe will materialize. And fundamentally, I think AMZN is a threat to every retailer; but when you're trading at a 5x forward multiple you have less far to fall, and infinite upside. ",17,0.82,1519782476.0

If we start from the FCFF figure, we’ll have $1 bn / year stashed away after interest payment. That builds up to $3 bn by 2020, so that maturity is sorted, but what about the $22.8 bn that’s afterwards?

&nbsp;

Given that their revenues are unlikely to grow at a rate to cover the debt, it seems to me that they’d have to sell either Salix (which was actually on the table for $10bn late 2016), or B&L. I’d guess Salix would be the more palatable option.

&nbsp;

If they sell Salix for $10 bn, they lose $1.6bn of revenues. Say after the sale their FCFF is $2.1 bn (just going by the same ratio of FCFF/revenues as now), their new interest payment would be $1 bn, so between now and 2025 they could put aside $8bn for debt repayments. Still not completely out of the woods, but at least it’s a much more manageable scenario.

&nbsp;

Alternatively they could sell equity, but not sure if there would be any demand for that.

I've heard that some institutions use 200 moving average to make investment decisions, or rules regarding market capitalization, dividends, the list probably goes on forever.

Many of the rules that institutions use are designed to prevent catastrophic losses (successful or not) , so a smaller  investor might profit when an institution changes a position for reasons other than what small value investors might.

One insight that I've learned is that in a spin off, the institutional shareholders may not be able to hold the spin off due to some technicality (small market cap, or something else), and so the spin off might be sold off irrationally, giving an opportunity for a value investor to buy shares more cheaply.

This assumes everyone maintains a net margin above 20% despite increasing competition.

Disney, Time Warner, Comcast, Amazon all generate more cash, generate more revenue. There must be a reason why Disney prefers to publish 10-20 movies annually instead of >80(?) for example. Netflix is earning less than 4 times interest, interest is more likely to go up than down in the future based on historic levels.

t3_82cpfs,Help calculating PLNT total net leverage ratio,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for a little understanding on how Planet Fitness is calculating their total net leverage ratio. In their most recent 10-K (page 58) they stated:

> As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our senior secured credit facility financial covenant with a leverage ratio of 3.4 to 1.0 which was calculated
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 based upon certain adjustments to EBITDA, as provided for under the terms of our senior secured credit facility.

Per the terms of their credit agreement (page 35), here is their definition of total net leverage ratio:

> “Total Net Leverage Ratio” means, on any date, the ratio of (a) the difference between (i) Total Indebtedness on such date less (ii) the amount of Unrestricted Cash and Unrestricted Cash Equivalents of the Loan Parties not at any time to exceed $30,000,000 on such date to (b) EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on or most recently prior to such date.

Just above that there's a definition for total indebtedness which is the sum of 5-6 things which are not immediately clear to me. For brevity in this post I'm not copying it here but the link to the agreement is at the bottom.

I'd like to see if someone here can come up with the same 3.4 to 1 leverage ratio that they have in their 10K, and show the calculation used to get there based on the numbers in their most recent statements. I've tried a bunch of different calculations but I keep coming up with higher ratios, like 4.69:1 and 4.05:1.

Any takers?

That includes combing exhaustively through the notes even the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity in order to see how the accounting works (to the point where I can more or less reconstruct journal entries) and what exactly is in every line item. Figuring out what is in every line item is fairly easy with research but it's much harder trying to reconstruct the journal entry that most likely resulted, which I feel gives a much broader and interconnected view of line items. The difficulty is partially a result of numbers often not matching up between the notes and the financial statements and I can't figure out if it's due to rounding error, foreign currency effects, or something other than that such as a loss on a accelerated share repurchase agreement. This is tedious and time consuming work, for instance, it took me like 2 days to figure out how Restricted Stock Awards and Units were differentiated and their tax implications for accounting etc. and that was a single note so I'm just trying to make sure I'm going about this in the correct way and not wasting my time.

(Please note I'm not complaining about this task as I find it enjoyable and I've read the two famous posts here about starting the research process.

>My attraction to fundamental analysis weakened further as practical difficulties appeared. It is almost impossible to estimate earnings for more than a year or two in the future.

Many “undervalued” stocks remain bargains for years, frustrating an owner who may have made a correct and ingenious calculation of the future prospects.  

Excerpted from the famous book <Beat The Market> by Edward Thorp.  

I believe you all know him. but for who don't know about him. i'll leave little bit of praising for him. He's a Ph.D of math and been worked as math professor for more than 20 years in several US universities such as MIT. and he invented the card counting for blackjack. he has beaten the casinos by using that technique. and it's the story of famous book <Beat The Dealer> in the 60s. after he got fame, casinos blocked him to enter. so he has moved to stock market.  

He's beaten the stock market as well by finding arbitrage opportunities especially for convertible bonds, warrants, options. he has achieved 20% annual returns over 30 years. thus he's a pioneer of Quants and Hedge Funds. he's also famous as first verifier of Kelly Criterion.  

There's an even more interesting story. a university student has read Thorp's first book <Beat the Dealer> and he went to Las Vegas to verify Thorp's technique. then earned substantial money. furthermore this lad read Thorp's second book <Beat the Market> as well and ultimately this young man has built bond company called PIMCO. he's Bill Gross.

NL Industries (fka National Lead Company) is essentially a holding company of three stocks (KRO, CIX, and VHI) with a significant amount of environmental liabilities on its balance sheet. NL holds $1.14B  in cash and stock but is only valued at $407M.


The biggest drag on the stock is an adverse court decision in CA under which NL and two other companies (Sherwin Williams and ConAgra) were held joint and severally liable for creating a “public nuisance” from its legacy lead paint businesses. While the settlement amount is still TBD and will undoubtedly be material, I believe the current discount overastates NL’s exposure by a huge margin..


I value NL at **$770M, or $15.81/share, for an upside of 89%** from its current price. The math on this is pretty simple, though I admit my analysis on the potential legal exposure is speculative. Nonetheless, the current discount leaves plenty of room to be wrong. 


**KRO – 35.2M shares at $23.53 - $828M**

Really all the value of NL is via its 30% stake in Kronos Worldwide. KRO produces titanium oxide which used by paint manufacturers to make paint white. The business is extremely cyclical and the product is essentially a commodity. While the business is on the up cycle, I believe the company is conservatively valued at 8.4x EBIT versus its peer average of ~18x (CC, TROX, VNTR).  


**CIX – 10.8M shares at $13.25 - $145M**

NL owns over 80% of CompX International which manufactures mechanical locks and boat parts. It’s admittedly a shit but stable business andI think the current valuation (P/E 13x, EV/EBITDA 7.2x) adequately captures this. 


**VHI – 14.4M shares at $6.91 - $100M**

VHI is the parent company of NL, KRO, and CIX (actually more like a “sub”-parent as VHI is owned by privately-owned Contran Corporation) . Why NL holds shares in its parent co. is beyond me.

I have yet to do any DD on VHI but it’s pretty immaterial relative its other holdings. If you want to be conservative go ahead and slash the value in half and call it $50M.


**Cash - $69M**

Now on to the liabilities….


**Total Liabilities – ($184M)**

NL really has no debt but is on the hook for environmental remediation costs and a nominal amount of accrued pension costs. For the sake of being conservative I’m subtracting total liabilities in their whole.

If you feel like fine-tuning this number note that while the balance sheet reports $107M in EROs, there's a footnote in the latest 10-K that notes this figure could increase to $154M.  If you do a DCF analysis on the $154M I expect you’ll get a similar amount. 


**Lead Abatement Settlement – Base Case:  ($188M),  Worst Case: ($283M), Best Case: ($0M)**

The original decision came in December 2013, where the judge ruled NL, SHW, and CAG (defendants) were joint and severally liable for $1.15M to fund an abatement program to remediate lead exposure in CA homes built pre-1980.

The defendants unsuccessfully appealed but the court did narrow the scope of homes to those built prior to 1950, which will significantly reduce the total settlement amount. The amount is pending re-review but NL’s attorney was quoted saying the will come in at ~$400M, while plaintiff’s attorneys say $700M. Call it confirmation bias, but I believe the math sides with the defense counsel. Here’s why:

The original ruling covered homes built prior to 1980, approximately 4.70M homes. When the appeals court narrowed the scope to pre-1950 homes, it reduced this to 1.55M homes, or 33% of the original amount. 33% of $1.15M is ~$378M.

While I peg the settlement amount at $378M, the ruling only covered 9 counties and other CA jurisdictions will undoubtedly pursue similar relief with ease. Fortunately these 9 counties covered 67% of the CA population per census data. As such I am using $565M as my total settlement projection ($387M divided by 0.67). 

Also worth noting: the average square footage of new homes increased significantly between 1950-1980, from under 1000 sqft. to 1600 sqft. which could further bring this number down. 

Here’s where it gets tricky: CAG, SHW, and NL will undoubtedly sue the hell out of each other to minimize their respective contributions. The three defendants are held joint and severally liable, meaning they are each liable for the full settlement amount. The plaintiffs can colllect this from any of the defendants, and I expect they will go after the most liquid company to get the full amount. This definitely won't be NL. It will then be up to the defendants to fight over who pays what.

For my base case I’m assuming each party equally splits the $565 amount, or $188M each. For my worst case I’m assuming NL pays half, or $283M which I believe is extremely unlikely – in reviewing the facts discussed in the court’s decision they each appear to be equally culpable.

Also, NL, CAG, and SHW will have the opportunity to drag other tortfeasors into this. 


 I see four ways NL gets out of paying all together:

1 – SCOTUS overturns the CA ruling. While something like 1% of cases get accepted for SCOTUS review, this one has a higher likelihood IMO given the policy implications. NL is basically being retroactively charged with creating a public nuisance through its promotion of a legal product. This sets a dangerous precedent – think gun manufactures, oil and gas, alcohol and tobacco, opiates, etc. Either way, probably shouldn't count on this outcome. 

2 – CA Voters pass the Health Homes and Schools Act in November 2018. The defendants are cleverly funding a ballot initiative to create a $2B fund for lead paint remediation which would nullify the court’s ruling all together. Take a guess on how I’ll be voting.

3 – Sherwin Williams pays NL’s share. I have no real basis for this, but NL sold its leading paint brand to SHW in 1980. I could see NL arguing that SHW is the successor in this liability. 

4 – NL’s GL insurance covers its contribution. NL has insurance but frustratingly doesn’t disclose how much. Either way, NL will fight tooth and nail to have its insurers pay all/some of this. However, I have no doubt the insurance companies will argue NL’s mandatory contribution to the abatement fund doesn’t qualify as covered “damages”, and the argument will be decided in court.


Final Value - $770M or $15.81/share


Biggest risks

1 – downturn in TiO2 cycle leading to KRO price decrease
2 – attorney’s in other states will try to replicate the same legal approach. I’m less concerned on this as California is uniquely retarded, and similar suits have failed in other states. Still, this is the biggest bear thesis.
3 – NL’s contribution to the abatement fund is larger than expected


I should note that NL does have recurring corporate costs (~11-12M a year which should wind down as legal issues get resolved). I should DCF this and subtract from my valuation, but fine without as I think I'm already conservative on valuing the liabilities.

t3_84vozr,How many stocks do you own? What is your level of concentration?,"There are pros and cons to both diversification and concentration. But I think there is a middle ground. Graham and Schloss would own 100+ stocks at a time. I have an analyst friend who was taught that lack of diversification is a sign of laziness, and therefor a diversified investor is not lazy. I argue the opposite, the more stocks that you have, the less research and news you can monitor on each security, and so the diversification is a replacement for the laziness of intensive research. 

It could be that both are correct, a diligent securities analyst may choose to have a portfolio of 20, or a portfolio of 100.

For now, I am spreading my bets relatively thin, primarily because I still have not developed a mechanism to judge the relative upside for each security, and partly because there are no securities that I am tracking that are absolute no-brainers.

From what I've learned, I will continue buying cheap stocks, and not fear reaching up to 100 positions (the thought raises my blood pressure already). But importantly, when a once in a lifetime opportunity comes about, I am ready to concentrate into that position.

t3_85945g,"Need help understanding ""elimination of anti-dilution ratchet""","Hi folks, I was reading the ""Moelis plan"" regarding Fannie and Freddie and came across something that I'm not sure I understand correctly (link to the plan can be found [here](http://gsesafetyandsoundness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Safety-and-Soundness-Blueprint.pdf)). Please let me know if my interpretation is correct.

**Background**

Page 6 of the plan provides some precedents for private capital to recapitalize the GSEs. In the case of Ally Financial (aka GMAC) I came across this paragraph:

> In November 2013, as a precursor to its IPO, Ally paid Treasury a total of approximately $5.9 billion for the repurchase of preferred stock simultaneous with a private placement of approximately $1.3 billion of common stock, diluting Treasury's common stock ownership stake from 73.8% to 63.5%. **In order to attract new private capital, as part of the November 2013 transaction Treasury eliminated the anti-dilution ratchet on its warrants.** 

Again on page 36 I ran across this in the footnote where Moelis is providing an illustrative recapitalization timeline for Fannie and Freddie:

> Illustrative transaction analysis assumes Treasury exercises it's warrants for 79.9% ownership and immediately prior to an IPO and receives 8.2 billion shares in the Enterprises (on a consolidated basis). **This could also be executed by removing Treasury's anti-dilution ratchet to attract new private capital.** 

**My interpretation**:

* In the case of Ally, Treasury had an anti-dilution clause on their warrants, meaning that if they were exercised, their common stake ownership would have remained at 73.8% regardless of any additional capital brought on
* Treasury removed this anti-dilution clause in order to allow the current common stock holders to maintain their ownership without dilution. This would demonstrate to the private capital markets that if they provided capital to Ally that Treasury would also act in such a manner without diluting their stakes. If Treasury had not removed the ratchet then it would have been much more difficult to raise private capital
* I assume Treasury currently has similar warrants in Fannie and Freddie. The Moelis plan suggests Treasury analogously eliminates its anti-dilution ratchet from these warrants in order to allow the current common stakeholders to maintain their ownership and thus provide confidence to other investors that it's ""safe"" to invest in the GSEs",4,0.84,1521346324.0

My brief and short valuation of Photronics. PLAB is a semiconductor photomask manufacture trading in the mid cap range. Numbers in the following is partly from 10-K and partly from 10-Q.

Net assets calculation:
Current assets @ 50 % discount: 492,357 * 50 % = 246,178.5
Total liabilities @ 100 %: 163,009
 
Net assets = 83,169.5

Human capital calculation:
SG&A @ 1x: 43,585

Human capital = 43.585

Property, Equipment and Land calculation:
PP&E @ 50 %: 1,862,163 * 50 %

Property, Equipment and Land = 931,081.5

Commitments calculation:
Operating leases: 3,925

Net Aseet Value: 83,169,5 + 43,585 + 931,081.5 - 3,925 = 1,053,911 USD

All numbers are in 1.000 so that’s roughly a NAV of 1 Billion. This number is about the same as its earnings price value ([operating income + depreciations - taxes]/discount rate + cash). I used 10 %. 

The NAV equals a share price of ~15,2 USD and at a margin of safety on 2/3 it’s a buy at anything less then ~10,1 USD. It currently trades at 9,05 USD. 

Any takes on this one? I own a small allocation while I’m getting comfortable that I bought at a little less then 8 USD. Do your own research, don’t consider this a buy recommendation.

Any thoughts on why the banks have been taking such a shellacking when they are probably the least impacted by trade treaties and while interest rates have unsurprisingly continued their upward trend?



Is it the manifestation of larger macroeconomic factors and uncertainties (e.g., GDP growth)? if so, I can't seem to tell what those would be..

Tesla's FCF for FY 2017 is equal to CFOA + CapEx + Principal Payments on Capital Leases = (3,579M), which is pretty straightforward.  However, Tesla includes the cash cost of purchasing operating leases in the changes in NWC section of CFOA.  This line item lowered CFOA by $1,523M in FY 2017.  I was wondering whether it would make sense to add back this line item to Tesla's FCF, as it is essentially cash used for an investing activity.

Other automotive OEMs include purchases of leased vehicles under CFIA (i.e. GM, F), so it would be more in line with industry standard to adjust Tesla's SCF in a similar way.  I believe the resale value guarantee offered with Tesla's leased vehicles may be the reason it is included in CFOA instead of CFIA.

t3_89c3cn,Facebook valuation - doubt about stock options and RSUs treatment,"Dear folks,
As I am trying to value Facebook as we all know what happend to the company and possible impact on its future. I come against a problem that is common to most of tech companies nowadays aka the treatment of stock options and RSUs and how to account them in the projection of future Cash Flows. Now from Facebook latest 10K of FY2017 we have following data provided:

From Income Statement:

Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (in million):
- Cost of revenue     178
- Research and development   2820
- Marketing and sales   436
- General and administrative    289
For a Total share-based compensation expense   3723

Now from the footnotes I read:
The aggregate intrinsic value of the options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $359 million, $309 million, and $403 million, respectively. 
The first question is: are these numbers already counted in the Income statements to calculate the net income (my gut guess is yes). So for options we don't have problems, the outstanding ones we can just use Black Scholes to calculate the value and subtract it from value of operating assets to come up with the equity value.

Now comes the complicated issue of RSUs:
From footnotes we have:

Unvested RSUs
- Unvested at December 31, 2016    98.586m shares
- Granted  36.741m
- Vested   -43.176m
- Forfeited - 10.937m
- Unvested at December 31, 2017  81.214m
Now you have more than 80millions RSUs, you can add them to the total outstanding no. of shares (which is a little rude and maybe underestimate the value a little bit)

The biggest question is however this: 
In the footnotes you have also this:

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $6.76 billion, $4.92 billion, and $4.23 billion, respectively.

As of December 31, 2017, there was $7.72 billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, substantially all of which was related to RSUs. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years.

Now clearly in the Income statements the total amount of share-based compensation of 3.723billion does not include all these RSUs, since the vested amount of RSUs in 2017 is 6.760 billion, and you have also unrecognized compensation expense of over 7b to be allocated in the next 3 years. My questions is how can we calculated correctly the existing impact of RSUs on the income statements for the present and most of all for the future. Do I need to revise my 2018-2020 numbers to subtract a 7b divided by 3?? if I have already a target average operating margin based on historical numbers, in that case do I still need to worry about RSUs?? 

Thanks for anyone who can help me to clarify on these issues or point to me any standard practice to account RSUs in valuation.

Cheers

t3_89l1d6,Questions regarding Buffett's 2010 Geico Valuation,"I apologize in advance for the elementary questions.

In the 2010 Berkshire annual letter, Buffett explained his 1996 estimate of Geico's intrinsic value to be $4.6 Billion:

$1.9 B Tangible Equity + $2.7 B Economic Value of Policyholders = $4.6 B valuation

Annual premium volume at the time was $2.8 billion, so Buffett was valuing customers at 97% of what they paid annually. 

My question is why is this 97% figure appropriate to determine policyholder's value?

 I assume that this hinges on estimates of how long policyholders remain with the Geico, future policy pricing and operational expenses? If this is the case, why does Buffett present policyholder's value as a percentage of annual premiums instead of a standalone figure?

Also, this valuation seems to disregard Geico's potential in 1996 to gain market share. What am I missing?

From the letter:
""Let me quantify Tony’s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn’t already
own, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangible
net worth of $1.9 billion.
The excess over tangible net worth of the implied value – $2.7 billion – was what we estimated
GEICO’s “goodwill” to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholders
who were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in
premiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO’s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were
annually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary
insurer: Because of the company’s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.
Today, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our
books at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICO
increases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic value
decreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick we
applied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO’s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And this
value is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO – off to a strong start in 2011 – is the
gift that keeps giving.""",14,0.78,1522805856.0

Kinda an odd question but I Thought you smart people can help me figure out something.

Im dating a girl whos father has died recently and left no will. She is the sole heir and has the step mom who her father married. In our state the heir and stepmom will split all assets 50/50. 

The assets included are a brick and mortar specialty food store selling oils and spices. My gf is wondering how she should value this business . Her step mom has low balled(we think) her and is pressuring her to sign over her part of the business.  MY gf's dilemma is she doesn't know if its a fair value offer for her portion or just a low ball ,like i think it is. 


I can type up the P/L for 3 fiscal years but just for example...in 2016 Revenue was  in the low 1,000,000 and they netted 50k.

To contrast she is being offered only 30k for 50% of her equity in the business. This to me seems kinda low basically a PE of 1. 

Can anyone shine any light on this situation. I know it isnt a normal run of the mill post on this sub so any help would be appreciated!

I'd like to start by saying, I'm in no way an expert on equity analysis yet. I've only recently finished the Mckinsey valuation book and begun to value companies on my own. I mention this to say that I'm willing to dedicate a lot of time to this as long as there is participation, but if more experienced members were willing to put some time it would add a lot of value. At any time, anyone that feels motivated can help take the reigns as well. Also, everything mentioned here is changeable if the community thinks there is a better way for it to be done.

**Discord Chat:** Unless mods have an issue with this, I think we should use the discord channel that is already available to communicate. https://discord.gg/gFu7Q3d

If possible, it'd be nice if a ""valuation projects"" channel could be added to discuss on-going projects. We can direct novice questions to the ""questions"" channel as to not dilute the project conversations to the same basic questions. 

**Bi-Weekly Polls for next company to value:** The bi-weekly part is negotiable, but I'd think a good way to do it is to post the poll for the next company valuation here on the r/securityanalysis sub-reddit, and then push all traffic to the discord channel for discussion. That's if the mods don't have an issue with that, if mods prefer for it to be posted somewhere else maybe we could start r/valuationprojects. 

**The ability to edit Google Drive:** I think we should grant permission by email to edit, instead of allowing anyone with a link to edit files. If you don't want your personal email connected to this it may be wise to create a separate email just for this. If there's a better way to go about doing this please let me know. We could also limit who gets the ability to edit files by asking them to submit self-generated valuations, or by asking if they have at least finished the Mckinsey Valuation book.

**Pooling resources:** Some of us have access to things like BamSEC, Bloomberg, Capital IQ, HOLT Lens, and etc. We could pool resources to help the ""valuation club"" as a whole.

If anyone is interested in talking about this more maybe we can chat in the comment section of this post or discuss it in the general discord chat here: https://discord.gg/xGavy5 

There was a lot of interest in the last post so hopefully, there is a good amount of participation.

Hi everyone - thank you for reading this. I appreciate any feedback I can get from those who've gone through the fundraising process or know someone who has.

Here's my situation: 

I was an investor at a top-performing, multi-billion dollar hedge fund for over five years (L/S equity). I probably sound like some jackass bragging on the internet, but I built a reasonably good initial track record during my time there.

Around 6 months ago, I decided to go out on my own and raise a small public equity fund. My goal was to raise $4m to $5m, so I can invest my way. My plan was to deliver some good results with a small asset base and raise more capital in a couple years.

I guess my plan was pretty naive - over the first 3-4 months it was a grueling process just to get the first $1.5m - $2.0m of commitments. Over the last 2 months I've pretty much plateaued, and it feels like I've tapped out my entire network of friends/family/fools (FFF) just to get to that ~$2m mark.

I've started to reach out to high-net worth individuals / family offices, but I've gotten radio silence from the 15-20 people I've emailed. It just feels like no one is interested in public equities these days. Almost everyone seems more interested in private equity or blockchain investments (I kid you not).

To date - the only people who have backed me are those that worked alongside me at the hedge fund and know my track record. I've really struggled to break through outside my network. 

I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how they got started or if they can share any potential pathways I should explore?

$1.5 - $2.0m doesn't feel like enough scale for a fund given all the fund level expenses these days (tax, audit, admin, etc). I've saved enough to be able to self-fund myself for a few years without a salary, but I care more about not ripping off my investors with high fund expenses (there's roughly $50-$75k of fund level costs that I can't control). 

I've toyed with the idea of SMAs to avoid these fund costs, but I don't know if it pays to start with such a small capital base regardless.

Thanks in advance to all. For those considering it, it's a very difficult public equity fundraising environment these days. The pendulum has really swung against public equity funds lately. However, given how hard it is to launch today, there's so much opportunity in the small/mid-cap space.",52,0.87,1523717332.0
t3_8c6dwm,Is having large long-term debt due to a property transaction better than other forms of debt?,"I'm looking at a niche company. It's small but specialized in what they do with a solid track record going back decades. 

They have a pretty good balance sheet all things considered and a current ratio of 1.77x. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is at 1:1. There is a large 30-year loan undertaken to finance the purchase of a piece of land. Basically, they were leasing the land on which their factories were built for the past few decades, and now they have bought over this plot of land. 

So their non-current assets have significantly gone up on the books, match by a significant increase in non-current liabilities. 

When using the decidedly simplistic NCAV valuation methodology this company does not appear to be cheap/undervalued.

1. It must be small.   ( Sheer size mitigates growth )
2. It must be relatively unknown.  ( Popular growth stocks are very likely to perform, but one has to pay for expected growth too much in advance )
3. It must be a unique product that does an essential job better, cheaper and/or faster than before or provide a new service with great and long continued sale increases.
4. It must have a strong, progressive, research minded management.

Excerpt from this [blog](https://biginvestorblog.com/2014/12/11/100-to-1-by-thomas-phelps-in-95-points/)  
and there's another newer book called [100 Baggers](https://www.amazon.com/100-Baggers-Stocks-100-1/dp/1621291650) that is inspired by this book. the author extended the original research to the period of 1970s to 2000s. seems the original classic book is very fascinating. if there was an ebook version i would have bought it immediately. i'm hesitating to buy it. i'd love to hear any  thoughts on it from value investors. does anyone have read it?

t3_8co5bg,Help explaining Ben Graham's words on price adjustment,"Just getting a little tripped up on Graham's wording in Chapter 1 of Security Analysis. He talks briefly about the hazard of shares that can stay over/undervalued for an inconveniently long time to the point that new facts might supervene your original analysis (events occur that change the whole story before the price adjustment you planned on is ever realized). What's confusing me a bit is his prescription for the problem:

""the analyst must seek to guard himself against this danger in part by favoring securities in which the popular interest is keen enough to promise a fairly swift response to value elements which he is the first to recognize; in part by tempering his activities to the general financial situation - laying more emphasis on the discovery of undervalued securities when business and market conditions are on a fairly even keel, and proceeding with greater caution in times of abnormal stress and uncertainty."" 

Is it just me or does that sound contradictory? I may be getting caught up on the language or maybe this kind of approach was more practical in the 1930's. Would really appreciate some help or a little different explanation! Thanks in advance  ",5,0.77,1523890862.0

t3_8ddv54,Stuck in Penman's Financial Statement Analysis & Security Valuation,"First time poster. I'm hoping (but doubtful) that someone on this forum is familiar with Stephen Penman's Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation. I'm stuck on Chapter 7, pg. 220, bottom paragraph (5th edition). 

The issue at hand is finding a value using (among other things) a fade-rate for earnings reverting to GDP. Finding a fade-rate is simple enough; you just make one up! (x is your fade rate number) 

Growth rate for t+1 = (x * GrowthRateT) + ((1-x) * GDP). 

He just picks .9 and .8, applies the formula recursively, and graphs them (he even says ""The numbers are arbitrary; we're just using this to get an idea of what the market's idea is). 

However, he then says the price implied by these (using Google 2010A and 2011E, 2012E data) is 570.32 and 657.84. And that, for Google's $535 price at the time, x = .684.

I have no idea what formula he used to arrive at those numbers. 

The immediately preceding example shows the market's speculative valuation of a long-term growth rate (it comes out to 4.7%, forever) by subtracting book and a discount of the next 2 year's earnings from the market price. Book = $143.92 Discount rate = .10. Solving for g gives you 4.7%

$535 = $143.92 + (19.548/1.10) + (21.754/(1.1*(0.1 - g)).

This certainly isn't the formula to use when calculating value with a given fade-rate. 

So, any guidance here?",2,0.67,1524136536.0

t3_8dwh05,'Weird' investments and thinking differently,"I have been thinking a lot about investing today vs investing years ago. Today, everyone has the same information and it is becoming harder and harder to make money in markets like managers did years ago. So I have been exploring 'investments' that were strange to give me inspiration to help me think differently from the herd. 

I think it would be useful for all of use to try to compile a list of 'strange' or out of the ordinary investments and approaches.

For example:

* Warren Buffett's Cocoa bean trade:
""The obvious solution was to buy Rockwood & Co. shares for $34, sell them back to the company for $36 in cocoa beans, and then sell the cocoa beans for $36. The process netted an instantaneous return of about 6%. Considering the transaction could be done in less than a week, it worked out to a sky-high annualized return.""

* Kovner and Throp buying an oil tanker for a little bit above scrap value when there was an excess of oil tankers. Once oil production increased--they waited for the next cycle--they were able to use the ship for years to make a fortune.

* Some of these distressed debt situations that Elliot does. They sue a country to repay the debt. I don't if I just think this is strange because it sounds crazy to sue a country.

I am sure there are many more, but I have been having trouble finding more. I would say most equity trades probably would not fall into the 'strange' category, but I may be wrong.

In addition, who are some authors--who write on investing or not--who get you to think differently?  I like Nassim Taleb's ideas because they are pretty contrarian.

t3_8fp4io,Discussion on Netflix from a security analysis perspective,"Hi all,

I’m a long time lurker of this sub and have seen a whole bunch of very useful info on security analysis here, so I thought I’d come here to ask some questions about Netflix. Note: I understand the general sentiment on this stock, and I know this isn’t a value play or anything, I’m just more interested in gaining some outside perspective on analysis of the stock.

1) Amortisation of content is a significant cost for Netflix, and they are quite aggressive in how they schedule it (relative to Disney etc.). My thoughts going forward is that amortisation as a % of revenue should decline, as the cost is spread against a greater user (hence revenue) base, and as new subscribers watch old content, current amortisation is overstating the true expense. Basically, there seems to be a fair degree of operating leverage in this model (but this is sort of dependent on how content scales across geographical regions – so far it has proved to scale fairly well). Is this reasonable?

2) In terms of capital structure (both horizon and terminal), I’m having difficulty forecasting given Netflix’s operating structure is unique and disruptive (hence I can’t see any real mature comparables). I’m essentially assuming refinancing of their current outstanding obligations (and have factored in the announcement of 1.9bn raising – which I have assumed will be raised at the current 10Y B+ spread of 389bps over Rf), and from a covenant perspective, there isn’t a whole lot stopping them from increasing their debt load (which seems rather mad to me given their cash flow position). Does anyone have any insight into how to approach the capital structure question?

3) Following on from 2, Netflix has an implied cost of debt which exceeds the weighted yield on their outstanding obligations. By my understanding, their implied cost of debt (given their status as B+) should be ~ 7.5%, but their weighted yield sits around 5% (factoring in their further junk raise). Is this an error made by me? Or is this the debt market essentially riding the equity train? Given the serious risks inherent in the Netflix model, and debts inability to share upside, why would there be such a deviation? I’m sceptical (and fairly ignorant) of the liquidation value of Netflix’s assets in a liquidation event.  

4) Tax. Although this is a fairly minor point, I’m fairly unfamiliar with the US tax code, and it differs a lot from Australian corporate tax (where I’m from). I’ve fairly simplistically assumed 25% into perpetuity. My rationale is 21% + a premium for state taxes, and im also considering that going forward, the vast majority of revenue will be taxed overseas, which has a higher marginal tax rate compared to US (I think global average is somewhere around ~28%). 

4) Capital expenditure is a huge driver of the model for Netflix. Management have indicated their spending intentions this year, (approx. 7-8bn on a P&L basis – equating to approx. 12.5bn in cash flow). Their current intention seems to be: spend lots on content (and gradually shift to a greater focus on original content to bypass the complicated/costly fee structures of outsourcing content) to attract a customer base. I think one really intriguing element underscoring Netflix is its wealth of user data; it essentially has an amazing insight into the tastes of its consumers and can tailor content to suit these desires – this to me seems like a serious advantage going forward. Does anyone have any insight into how we might expect capex/sales to moderate? 

Keen to have a good discussion on this security. Thanks guys!

""In terms of investing I would say that there is no exact formula for what we do. We try to use all the value investing principles we know. The world is imperfect. The world doesn’t just dish up net, nets all the time. The world doesn’t dish up stocks trading below cash all the time. Doesn’t deliver fine businesses at eight times earning. All the time.

So we look very hard for mis-pricing, for information asymmetries. for supply / demand imbalance, and we find ourselves at various times heavily in distress debt or no position in distress debt, significantly involved in equities and uninvolved in equities, very focused on private markets or uninvolved because you can create the same assets cheaper in the public market.

So in a nutshell that’s our approach. Very opportunistic. We try to be not siloed the way many people are. We don’t have industry analysts we have generalists who can move quickly from working one day on a drug stock, to another day on the distress debt of a bank, and another day even potentially on a mortgage security  or real estate investment. That’s not easy but it does provide constant stimulation, a lot of cross training, which people enjoy, and it also means that our resources will always be deployed in the most interesting areas all the time.""

I have had experience with L/S equity pitches and also understand the basics of fundamental credit (price/yield, seniority, covenant..).

As I am starting out with some analysis, I realized that certain things like long-term growth initiatives might mean different things for equity vs debt holders (cash outlay). Also, what is kind of throwing me off is the capped upside on a HY bond (10-15%), and I guess just how to go about to justify/evaluate that in a thesis. The only credit pitch that I have ever worked on (with someone else) was one already in default (trading at 10c on the dollar), so any advice in general would be tremendously helpful.

t3_8jjnoa,Question about cheap unpopular company,"Hi,

I have a problem with one company, computer software/hardware  retailer. Not sure what to think about it.

The company is cheap (even using Graham's criteria): selling much below book value, very low P/E, profitable for many years, very low debt etc. So the numbers scream ""BUY"".

But there are three problems:
1) the capitalization is relatively small so no big investor would be considering engagement
2) the stock is very, very illiquid (it strenghten even further the importance of problem above)
3) 55% of the stock is owned by the CEO whose ethics related to communication with other shareholders is quite low (but probably is a good operational manager) and he doesn't want to pay dividends.

Now, the stock price is very low and have been very low for 2 years. I believe the CEO do everything to bring the price down so that he could bought back all the shares for himself and take the company out of stock market. But in the same time shareholders aren't stupid and they want good price for cheap stock (the price that CEO is not willing to pay). In the result the price is fluctuating in very narrow range at very low price levels.

What do you think are the prospects? Would you buy and let say wait 1-2 years?

thanks for any suggestions

- ""I don't pay any attention to what economists say, frankly,"" he said.

Warren Buffett believes economists do not add value for investors.
In a 2016 interview video clip found using CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive, the billionaire investor explained why he does not give much credence to financial market predictions from economists.
""I don't pay any attention to what economists say, frankly,"" Buffett said two years ago. ""Well, think about it. You have all these economists with 160 IQs that spend their life studying it, can you name me one super-wealthy economist that's ever made money out of securities? No.""

The Oracle of Omaha cited the example of the economist John Maynard Keynes, who went through periods of heavy losses trading currencies in the 1920s and 1930s and stumbled while speculating on stocks. Buffett said Keynes faltered using top-down economic forecasts such as credit cycle predictions.
But when Keynes switched to a value philosophy focused on owning stocks of a few well-run companies over the long term, his investment performance improved, Buffett noted.
""If you look at the whole history of [economists], they don't make a lot of money buying and selling stocks, but people who buy and sell stocks listen to them. I have a little trouble with that,"" the investor added.

I'm coming to you today because I've been learning a lot of value investing recently, but it's hard to know if I'm on the right track. 


So what I do is I compare myself to other analysts of the same company, see how far am I. Their number is of course not an absolute truth, but I guess it's closer to it than one calculated by a beginner.


So, let's take Michelin, which is a French big cap.

http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xpar/ml/quote.html


Why did I pick this ? Well, furthmore than being French myself, this is a pure stable/non-growth company. So... I guess it's supposed to be easier to estimate.


* The company has almost no debt and no financial health issue (0,2 debt/equity, current ratio 1,83, Baa1 Moodys)
* Its rentablity is very good (ROE/ROIC >10% for many years)
* BV per share is at 58,03€ and with a growth average of 8,8%/year (10 years)
* Dividends were 3,25€ in 2017 and with a growth average of 13,8%/year (10 years)


So I have everything I want to compute a intrisic value calculation. This gives me an average of around 100-110€ for a return of 6-9% per year during 10 years, which seem fair to me regarding averages return of placements today + risk.


Current share value is at 116€ so for me, it's a bit overpriced. As I begin I tend to put a big margin of safety even afterwards, so here if I compute 100€ I wouldn't buy above 80€.


However, when I look at analysts who publish in the press, I see they analyze the fair value around 140€. Some even state 150€ or 170€ !!!  With my model, 170€ is equivalent to a annual return of 1% ! How can I be so far off ? Is there a big parameter I am missing here ?

t3_8mxgcx,Altice USA - long thesis with catalysts,"Some of my initial thoughts on Altice USA – which is potentially a 'special situation' in the cable sector. The company is currently undergoing some structural changes as they are being spun off from their struggling European parent, Altice \(referred below as Altice EU\) went through a reckless buying spree over the last few years.

I thought it could be interesting, as Altice USA is further along in the capex journey in terms of upgrading to digital, than Charter \(being that they have a smaller footprint to upgrade\) and they have suffered from being an arbitrage target over the last few months \(IPO lockup period ended in Dec 2017, and a 27&#37; short on the float due to spin dynamics\).

**Altice USA:**

* **Current price**: $18.50; **Market Cap**: $13.6bn, **Net Debt**: $22bn \(5.4x\)
* **Fourth largest cable provider in the US** – with 4.5m customers and passes through 8.6m homes
   * 45&#37; of the $9.3bn in revenue is made up of TV and 55&#37; broadband
      * Broadband is accelerating growth with 4Q17 rev up 13.1&#37; driven by ARPU growing 10.6&#37; y/y.
      * Similar to Charter, I expect **EBITDA margins for broadband are approximately \+60\%** versus 40&#37; for the whole business \(company does not break this out\)  due to high programming costs/carriage fees \(approx 70&#37; of tv revenue\)
* Strong fundamentals with attractive valuation **\(8.0x 2018E EBITDA** versus Charter at 9.4x\)
* Background: In 2015 Altice EU, a European telecom company, purchased US cable systems Suddenlink and Cablevision – \(will do MR on what they paid for these businesses\)
   * Altice EU IPO’d 10&#37; of the Altice USA shares on the NYSE for $30 in June 2017, the shares currently trade around $18.50
   * **Altice EU has decided to spinoff Altice USA on June 8th**  which will increase the float by 4x
* Altice EU shareholders will receive 0.4163 of a US share for each share in the spinoff. As a part of the spin, **Altice USA has committed to a $2bn repurchase** over the next 3 years \(15&#37; of the MC\)
* Altice EU went on a massive M&A spree over the last few years, and now find themselves highly geared \(6.5x\) and with little to show for it – hence why they are slowly divesting assets
* Due to the decision to spin, arbitragers have been heavily shorting Altice USA \(currently short sales account for 27&#37; of the float\)
* Further to the arbitrage dynamic, the lockup period for the IPO has also served as an overhang which expired in Dec 2017. The number locked up was more than 233m and only 51.7m were trading at the time
* **Tax loss carry\-forwards** will shield Altice USA’s rising cash flow and the US business has committed to buying back stock with that cash

t3_8nlrzy,GNC -,"Currently GNC is trading at only 1.16X operating cash flows. Can the distressed experts please chime in?

Operating income is robust, debt is being paid down, and there is plenty of free cash flow.

Maybe someone has spent some more time on this already and can explain what the risk factors are to be aware of. The Harbin financing deal was supposed to be instrumental to keep the company alive, but the public hasn't taken the bait. Is the market correct?

If February, they announced: China’s state\-controlled drugmaker Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co \(600664.SS\) will buy an about 40 percent stake in U.S. nutritional supplements retailer GNC Holdings Inc \(GNC.N\) for $300 million and are in talks for a joint venture in China, the companies said.

$300m at 40&#37; is a market cap of $750m, that is a stock price of about $9, currently trading at $3.25.

Newly issued convertible perpetual preferred shares with a conversion price of $5.35 and a 6.5&#37; annual coupon payable in cash or in kind.  The investment is expected to be used by GNC to, among other things, repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes, further enhancing GNC's capital position

This paragraph states a $5.35 conversion price.

Some more notes from the 10Q. They extend a 2019 note to 2021, conditional on repayment of at least $50m. The existing $150m is due 2019 \(but that is what Harbin came in for, right\). They also took on $375m of debt due 2022. Rates are not great, between 4.3\-10.6&#37;. The term loan requires payment of 75&#37; of excess cash flow until it is further paid down.The reported fair value of their outstanding Notes has appreciated nearly 50&#37; since 3 months earlier. I don't know how to check the secondary markets for their debt, can anyone confirm the valuation of their debt?

Even after the Harbin deal there will be a little over $1b of debt on their books. The company peaked at $355m of operating cashflows, down to $199m in TTM,  If operating cash flows continue to deteriorate then it will be harder to service the $1b of debt.

And there does happen to be a growth story here, GNC is entering China, India, and Australia. Their China partner, Harbin, is currently doing $1.8b USD per year in revenues \(and declining\).

GNC is a trustworthy brand on the one hand, on the other hand as a commodity seller they compete poorly with Amazon. If the public trusts the brand and the in\-house products of GNC, and chooses to keep buying it from other places \(like Amazon, China, etc\), then the company can successfully shed off more and more physical real estate, while increasing net margins overtime. They have more than 5000 stores, and are closing 200 this year.

Do you think GNC is in a death spiral, why, why not?",5,0.62,1527798403.0

with my limited understanding, i regard BVPS growth rate as **Velocity** of fundamental growth. and EPS growth rate as **Acceleration** of fundamental growth. so even if EPS decreases i can say the firm is still growing unless it's non negative. i'm not sure but i guess the market assumes that the firm grows at certain growth rate \(BVPS growth rate\) and reacts sensitively to the change of EPS growth rate. because change of **Acceleration** would change th**e Veloci**ty ultimately. it seems the market give higher P/E when expecting EPS growth rate \> BVPS growth rate state. because it'**s Veloci**ty would become higher. and pays 1/r of P/E when expecting EPS growth rate = BVPS growth rate state. it's my basic understanding of stock. am i getting anything wrong? thanks for reading.",2,0.67,1527875090.0
t3_8nob9m,Feedback on Investing Analogy write-up ?,"Sorry if this doesn't 100% fit the sub and I can remove if it breaks the rules, but I'm looking for feedback on my write-up on comparing cricket and investing. I want to be able to show my mum (Lame I know but she takes an interest in what I do with my time and I want her to understand how I think/feel on investing), whilst also selfishly improving my own writing skills. Any feedback if it does/doesn't make sense or what can be improved is greatly appreciated! As per below:




Like the baseball analogy used by Buffett, I often find myself comparing investing to cricket in certain ways as well. Whilst my comparison might not make as much sense as Buffett’s, nor will it be objectively as good as his, I originally wrote this in order to express my ideas more clearly whilst also being able to show my Aussie mother who has more of an understanding of cricket compared to baseball.

Now imagine you get to be a batsman. The goal is obviously to score runs (make money) and there will be no stumps to hit, so you can only get out by taking a swing and getting caught out.

In investing and in cricket, you are given a multitude of opportunities and how to react to these opportunities is completely up to you. You may decide to be a player who is aggressive, looking to score off every ball, but this comes with increased risk of getting yourself out of the game.

Play more defensively however, by choosing not to swing at balls that don’t provide a good chance to provide runs (risk vs reward) and simply waiting for a bad ball (a good investment opportunity) to come up, and you reduce your chances of getting out of the game. This is the way I want to play.

We are given a number of balls to face yet we don’t have to swing at any of them. We can leave all we want to wait for the half tracker to punched along the ground to the boundary. 

I imagine batting against the opening fast bowler as investing in a frothy or at least fairly valued market. Whilst opportunities are there of course, they’re are hard to come by, require great consideration and run the larger risk of getting yourself out.

Whereas investing in the bottom of a market cycle would be the equivalent of waiting for that medium pacer to slow things down a bit and to provide more opportunities for runs and returns.

While I consider myself as a defensive minded player, I don’t keep the same mindset 100% of the time, I patiently bide my time, effectively wait for the 2nd and 3rd string bowlers to come on and pick them off.

If you run and range of outcomes with a number of players, playing purely aggressive only, some might hit it out of the park and score insanely high, but at a higher risk of blowing up that which is a risk I’m not prepared to take.

And sure a defensive player might cop a few balls that don't turn out anywhere near expected, but our aim is to at least be aware of these black swan events as Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls them, in order to mitigate any potential damage.

Whilst we might not know what bowlers are next to come (and what returns to expect in the future), as Howard Marks says:


> ""We might not know where we’re going , but we ought to have a fair idea of where we are” – Howard Marks

I don’t think I’ve nailed this analogy 100%, but hopefully it makes at least some sense to you and the people I want to know what I’m doing and how I invest.

*Either way, I’m just trying not to get out*

One thing that i can come up with is the buying cycle. i regularly visit grocery once per week. but i bought my current PC in 2011 and i'm still okay with it. before that i had to buy newest PC every 2 or 3 years. but it has been lengthened due to slowed advance speed of technology. so i could predict the stagnation of PC industry even without considering the advent of mobile age. in same perspective, i can say that auto industry is more volatile than food industry due to it's buying cycle difference.

So i'd like to ask that do you have any other factors, approaches that could be helpful to distinguish earnings cyclicality? how do you know that your firm's earnings would not suddenly plunge? where's your conviction come from that the firm at least can keep current level of earnings? i'm asking very general question. not industry specific. thank you.",14,0.9,1527929982.0

I’m eagerly scanning all the 8-K (and other filings) my spare time can muster in the pursuit if learning how to uncover special situations that might be good value investments.

Today I stumbled upon Schulman A’s latest 8-K (yup a couple days behind), and saw that LyondellBasell Industries plans to merge with Schulman A.

The offer: 42 $ per shares (currently around 44.35 $) and contingent value right currently judged to be worth 2.35 $ given that “the market is correct”. The rights gives the holders 85 % of the proceeds regarding some litigation less customer claims and expenses of the first 38.5 m$ and splits the proceeds 85/15 between CVR right holders and LyondellBasell of amount above that. 

My question is not whether this is a good value trade, but rather if anybody have examples of previous mergers with CVR’s gave good returns and bad returns so I can study them a bit?

And does anybody have good experience with value investing in this area? If the merger goes through and it’s possible to buy the share (have not been so yet) for less then 42 $ it seems like a nobrainer. Of course mergers does not always go according to plan.

How can I gauge a companies ability to successfully integrate vertically? Horizontally? 

What other questions should I be asking?

t3_8s81fp,'Back of the envelope' Calculations,"Hi all,

I hear this thrown around a fair bit: ""it should only require a back of the envelope calculation"". As a novice value investor, this seems very enticing to me... synthesizing the immense amount of inputs that go into any valuation into a few key value drivers, and using these to arrive at a price, without labouring through the process of creating a functioning model. And its not that i disregard the importance of DCF models, but I often find the assumptions (especially as the forecast-horizon increases) egregious. With so much value stored in the terminal value, and with how sensitive it is to your inputs, it intrigues me that successful market participants can translate current operating characteristics into a clear idea of underlying value. Can anyone provide any insight into this? Can you give me examples of investments you may have made where value was so clear, and what the characteristics of the operations/financials were that made it so? 

This question essentially stems from my recent examination of an Australian growth firm which looks extremely attractive to me in terms of its underlying economics and attractive capital structure (essentially allowing for an annualised ROCE of 35-40%). But, as i laboured through the DCF, making assumptions about future capital raising, growth rates etc., it felt dismal trying to make any meaningful attempts at forecasting revenue/operating margins etc. 5+ years out.

My intuition is that these back of the envelope calculations may revolve around cash flow yields, i.e. a 20% FCFE yield is clearly attractive. But i'd love to hear from all you knowledgeable people and your thoughts.

t3_8sgirg,technicolor,"Technicolor is value filth of the highest order. Below is a quick and dirty look at it.

Interested in hearing any feedback from people with good knowledge of connected home and production businesses.

Technicolor (TCH) is a deeply unloved amalgamation of 4 entertainment businesses, 2 which matter and 2 which provide free options in the future, but all 4 have caused the problems in the stock. 

Set top box and router business – Almost doubled the size of this business in 2015 by buying Cisco’s business in cash and stock for $580m. Paying 0.3x sales and 6x EBITDA, this acquisition was meant to take them to scale and improve margins. However due to rising DRAM and NAND prices margins fell to 5.7% last year instead of the 10%+ they would have been without the higher chip prices.  At 10% margins and 6x EBITDA this business is worth €3.40 per share. 

Production – They produce and animate movies, adverts and games. They are one of the top 2 players in the visual effects (VFX) industry alongside Disney. The movies they worked on have won 4 Oscars and 3 BAFTA’s in the past year. Revenues were flat in this business last year after a big 2016 in the ad business. On a similar multiple to an ad agency at 8x EBITDA it is worth €2.20 a share.  

DVD – Historically they owned IP related to DVD production and printing but have since outsourced the majority of this to Sony. Nonetheless having anything related to DVD’s creates negative sentiment. With over a billion of revenues and 10% EBITDA margins the business has some value but we value it at €0.  

Licensing business – Involves licencing and enforcing its 40k patents in areas ranging from video coding to display technology. They sold this business for $150m earlier this year to IDCC. This was the final straw for most investors as they had valued it at considerably higher price. However TCH will get 42.5% of any future revenues from this without the management distraction of fighting lawsuits etc. IDCC have a very good track record monetising patents and if they were to achieve their average ROIC then it would translate to $28m (8c a share) a year of cash flow to TCH. We value the business at €0.  

Why is our view different?

We believe the stock is washed out and that most investors have given up on it after an 80% collapse since the beginning of 2016. The capitulation is clear as over 100% of the shares have traded since February this year. The change in the shareholder register is also interesting and appears to have gone unnoticed. Cisco have been a price insensitive seller as they dump the shares they got as part of the transaction, whilst the CEO and Chairman have recently bought shares. There has also been increased murmurings from quasi activists, RWC, JO Hambro and Lansdowne between them they own at least 15% of the shares. Unlike the rest of the market we do not believe memory prices will increase forever and with new supply coming on in the second half of ’18 pricing should normalise, meaning margins at TCH mean revert. 

Valuation  - no idea what goes on with table, looks fine when i try to edit it.

t3_8sev8k,Question on asset turnover,"Read this from Fisher's Common Stock and Uncommon Profits book:

""A company that has a high rate of sales in relation to assets may be a more profitable company than one with a higher profit margin to sales but a slower rate of assets turnover. For example, a company that has annual sales 3 times its assets can have a lower profit margin but make a lot more money than one that needs to employ a dollar of assets in order to obtain each dollar of annual sales.""

t3_8sduow,Aurora Cannabis and Medreleaf Risk Arb,"This is pretty short since there isn't much too it.

Aurora (""ACB"") is acquiring Medreleaf (""LEAF"") for 3.575 shares per share of LEAF. This currently equates to 22.6&#37; premium to LEAF's current trading price. 

First, ACB has a ridiculous borrow cost, so I'd suggest using a synthetic short on it as opposed to shorting it. I've structured my position to have a bit of upside to ACB's price, but there's no reason to if you want it to be strictly risk arb. 

The deal is expected to close August (with the special shareholder vote on July 18), so there isn't really any time risk. The annualized return is nearly unbeatable assuming it closes on this timeline.

The deal is going to go through because:

\- No real legislative hurdles. This makes Aurora the largest LP in Canada, but there are a substantial number of players still in the market.

\- LEAF requires 66.66&#37; of shareholders to vote in favor of the transaction. 56&#37; of the shareholders are already locked into voting in favor.

\- ACB requires a simple majority. This is likely the only real maybe as to a sticking point. ACB is widely held with no significant institutional investors. Institutions hold 4.4&#37; of shares, insiders hold 6.5&#37; of shares. I still don't see a world in which ACB votes this down. It's fully supported by both LEAF and ACB's boards. There are some concerns around ACB diluting further, but in the current market it's nothing but expected.

\- Hefty breakup fee of $80mn up to $95mn. 

\- Canadian senate passed the marijuana legalization bill an hour or so ago. I could've seen this as a possible issue (even though it not being passed was so minute), but it's no longer an issue unless you think the Crown won't give royal assent to the bill.

\- The little analyst coverage there is says the the transaction is highly likely to go through.

t3_8toue2,Special situation - Chapter 11 with liquidation incentived management,"Hey All,

Still on my quest to learning about different special investments. This weekend I stumbled upon Orexigen Therapeutics 8-K from the 22th of June. I have not heard about this company before, but they got me excited when I saw that the management was incentived to actually sell the assets of the company.

Basically Orexigen filed for ch. 11 on the 12th of march and got a bid the 23th of aprilk for its assets from Nalpropion Pharmaceutiicals of 75mUSD. 4 days before Bankruptcy Court approved a Key Employee Incentive Plan (KEIP), which basically means that management will score 350.000 USD if this sales go through. Bankruptcy Court wanted a ""Stalking horse"" bidder, and on the 22th of June, the company said they did not receive any other bids. A little side note, two days after the KEIP was approved, a little investor called Baupost was mentioned in a SC 13D report owning 37,5 &#37; of the company (Up significantly according to my Bloomberg right now). Not a lot of shares are changing hands (from an institutional perspective) which might keep some away because its difficult to build a significant position.  


My question is, if the company gets sold, what about the DIP financing they got, dont they have a claim on the proceeds before equity holder? (Seems like its ""only"" 35m). And what about all of the other debt, can that just go with the assets in a sale like this? And lastly, is this a common situation during chapter 11 cases where a reorganisation is not possible and do you have examples going good and going bad?

t3_8wy23m,Debenhams- undervalued or am I missing something?,"The below is a summary of why I think Debenhams (a UK clothing retailer) is currently undervalued significantly. This is the first company I have seriously researched since starting to look into value investing over the last couple of months so there's a very real chance I've made mistakes in the process or have numbers wrong etc, and all of the below is just my view on things but I'm interested in getting a second opinion.

----------
Despite significant drops in earnings over the last 5 years, I believe that at the current share price of 15p, 3.8x  PE* and <5x price to cash(2), the company is undervalued.

Looking at book value, with a market cap at 0.2 x equity(2) the business still seems undervalued. However, intangible assets are around £1bn, of which £820m is goodwill- so with equity of £890m, if the business were to go bankrupt the shareholder would likely be left with nothing.

The organisation has issued three profit warnings this financial year which it attributed to difficult trading circumstances surrounding the post-Brexit consumer confidence slump and extreme weather causing temporary store closures in early 2018. The CFO departed at the time of the third profit warning which could have also reduced confidence in the business.

I don't believe the business will go into administration due to the short-term nature of the trading issues and the fact that they still have around £200m available in revolving credit on top of current debt, so I'm valuing them under the assumption they will continue trading.

I have chosen to use PE as the basis for my valuation as earnings are the only metric we currently have a degree of certainty of prior to the end of year results (EOY = September 2018); however, price to cash using the half year report was <5x which is significantly lower than the 13.6x 5 year median value which I think provides a very large margin of safety. I would feel comfortable buying at around 15p per share with the confidence that the share price will reach at least 27p (based on lowest earnings estimates), either gradually over time or with the end of year results acting as a catalyst. Depending on the cash/equity situation at that time it could have an intrinsic value of around 40p (assuming same cash as half year point).

At the point of the annual report, a decision would need to be made on the long-term longevity of the company as this analysis is based purely on the company being significantly undervalued today and not on its future growth potential (although I appreciated those two things are intrinsically linked). They have shown strong .com growth and the CEO, coming from Amazon, will approach decision making with a data mindset could ensure they succeed in the long-run, as could their 'social shopping' strategy of giving up store space to restaurants/gyms etc.

(1) lowest end of the range from most recent trading update in June.
(2) half year report.

edit: *the 3.8 PE is based on last year's earnings, not (1) as previously stated, (1) would give a PE of 6.4.",5,0.64,1531013222.0

t3_8x6xop,[How To] Security Analysis in Python,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm no investment guru. I just learn by trial and error, and by reading a lot. So if this sounds like a big pile of manure, my apologies in advance for the doo-doo.

I'm starting a youtube series on security analysis using Python / data science. It's completely free and doing it purely from the perspective of teaching. Maybe python is overkill but heck, i find it useful so maybe other people do too.

I used to be big into algorithmic trading, until one day, I looked at my algos returns and realized even though they did pretty decent, all the trading fees basically ate up big chunk of the returns to the point that there was no point in trading, and instead buying an index fund made a whole lot more sense. ;/

Since then I've been more active in the 3 fund portfolio (VTSAX, VTBLX, and the VTIAX). But started moving slowly into my own portfolio of equities.  This is some of the automation I've been working on as personal project.

If you don't like excel, or don't like doing manual data entry.. you're the person i'm talking to.

What I plan to cover:

* downloading / cleansing / aligning data
* using python / jupyter notebook to read in, comment, and visualize data
* analyzing financial statements - and how to connect the dots with charts / graphs
* how to automate the whole thing so you don't have to do this every time 10q/10k comes out
* how to templatize so you can screen stocks much faster

I don't know if this is interesting or useful, but I thought I would put it out there.

Oh yeah, and i'm doing this completely feed-driven - your feedback / ideas / suggestions will determine what I make.

t3_8y3uwo,Understanding Amazon,"Hey everyone, I just started looking at Amazon and I have a few questions.

Firstly, the investment thesis that I hear thrown around a lot is that Amazon has a weak bottom-line due to their continued re-investments, which is why their earnings are so low. On their balance sheets most of the revenue goes toward cost of sales, however, and it seems depreciation is another monster that ate up 12.2 billion from earnings this quarter alone. Hence, where in the world is this supposed ""re-investments"" as the reason for Amazon's meager earnings?

Secondly, I am struggling to understand if Amazon does have so little earnings, where in the world does it cough up its cash position that's currently sitting at 16.7 billion? So far, it seems to be almost entirely adding back depreciation. And if lease expenses are counted, the free cash flow of Amazon is significantly lower, and right now ""free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases decreased to an outflow of $3.0 billion for the trailing twelve months""so how is Amazon the FCF machine that people tout?

Some questions from a beginner. If you have any response I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",3,0.71,1531346167.0
t3_8ymw76,"Post-Wyndham spinoff thoughts: short WYND, long WH, any thoughts?","Did a whole write-up somewhere else, but I am just gonna talk about the basics here...seems to be that the spinoff has created a blatant arbitrage opportunity and mispricing in values for the two new Wyndham businesses, any thoughts here?

WH (Wyndham Hotels & Resorts): shit hotels, 52&#37; daily occupancy rate for its rooms, a third of the revenue per available room as Hilton and Intercontinental…yet now at almost a trailing PE of 20 it’s trading close to Hilton and Intercontinental, which trump WH in both occupancy (75&#37; daily occupancy rate on average for their different segments) and RevPAR. Moreover, as a mid-scale and economy hotel provider, it faces far much uncertainty in its occupancy and ability to attract customers in economic cycles. With the American economy more robust than ever in the past few years, its occupancy rate has actually be dropping (from 54.5&#37; in 2015 to 52.0&#37; in 2017). How could this business even justify having a PE ratio that approaches strong, high-end, high occupancy hotels like Hilton and Intercontinental? 

WYND (Wyndham Destinations): solid business, stable cash flow, long-term predictability. Not a fantastic business, but currently trades at close to 7 PE ratio. Marriott’s timeshare/vacation rental business is at 14, Hilton’s is at 22. 

Most importantly, WYND brings in triple the revenue of WH ($907M vs $302M), while WYND’s adjusted earnings is at $85M and WH at $58M from Q1 2018 (adjusted WH’s $64M in earnings by subtracting a $6M one-time hurricane insurance recovery revenue). And yet, WYND has the smaller market cap at $4.5B vs WH’s $5.84B. 

I haven’t been able to find that much information on either companies yet, just because the spinoff happened relatively recently and they haven’t filed independent financial statements and MD&As afterward. But anyone who has been following these companies have any thoughts?",4,0.83,1531509435.0
t3_8yfxnv,[Long thesis] Pershing Square Holdings (Bill Ackman's hedge fund) - Thoughts?,"Ackman’s stellar long-term record has been overshadowed by 3 years of underperformance and PSH shares now seems to offer significant value. Curious to get everyone's thoughts on this.  
**Summary**

* Pershing Square Holdings (PSH) is a hedge fund run by legendary value/activist investor Bill Ackman.
* Over the last 3 years, PSH’s concentrated fund has drastically underperformed the market by 70.1&#37;.
* As a result, PSH is currently trading at a [\~23&#37; discount to Net Asset Value (NAV).](https://www.pershingsquareholdings.com/company-reports/weekly-navs/)
* However, despite recent results, I argue that: (1) PSH’s long-term track record and performance is excellent, outperforming the market by over 272.8&#37; over the last 13 years. (2) PSH is extremely undervalued compared to its peers. (3) Significant catalysts exist that are expected to narrow the discount to NAV.

**Performance worries**

The major reason for the large discount to NAV is the underperformance over the last few years. Indeed, PSH has returned an abysmal -20.5&#37; in 2015, -13.5&#37; in 2016 and -2.1&#37; in 2017, compared to +1.4&#37;, +11.9&#37; and +21&#37; respectively by the S&P 500 for a total underperformance of 70.1&#37;.  


https://preview.redd.it/pue02mm3fj911.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee11e4f0205a6cc5aea24dd7f0a433a60d7c4c67

While the past few years have undoubtedly been disappointing, even accounting for these terrible years Ackman and PSH’s track record since inception is still stellar. Indeed, in the 13 years since 2004, PSH has generated 493.6&#37; compared to 220.8&#37; by the S&P 500, beating it by 272.8&#37;. Put another way, from 2004–2017, PSH has generated compounded annual returns of 13.6&#37; compared to 8.7&#37; by the S&P 500. This is an incredible long-term performance and 2018 results (8.8&#37; vs 0.97&#37; S&P) suggest mean reversion is underway and his 3 year losing streak may be over.  


https://preview.redd.it/zwt9n066fj911.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ef39205b007f82e83f3ca9b6ebf2314ed3b2ee

The gross results (i.e. actual investment results without accounting for hedge fund fees) are even more impressive, showing Ackman beating both the S&P 500 and Berkshire Hathaway by over 770&#37;, with gross compounded annual returns of 18.2&#37;.  


[Source: Slide 9 of this presentation \(https:\/\/assets.pershingsquareholdings.com\/media\/2017\/01\/26165616\/2016-PSH-Annual-Update-Presentation-FOR-DISTRIBUTION-1.pdf\)](https://preview.redd.it/9qiuyt3bfj911.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=63eda1eb095399046d85cfdd64c95374684b0c59)

It’s worth noting that PSH runs a notoriously concentrated portfolio with generally less than 10 positions and thus suffers from much higher volatility than most funds. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as many of the great value investors believe in concentration as it allows you to get to know a few companies very well. Greenblatt’s Gotham Capital achieved 40&#37; annualized returns from 1995–2006 while having 6–8 positions make up 80&#37; of the portfolio.

The downside of this is that afew big losers/winners can heavily skew the results. While in the past this benefitted Ackman with big winners such as General Growth Properties ([GGP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GGP)), Wendy’s ([WEN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WEN)) and Canadian Pacific ([CP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CP)), he’s made his fair share of mistakes over the last few years, the biggest of which being Valeant (VLX) on which [he reportedly lost $4.6B](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-14/bill-ackman-is-done-losing-money-on-valeant) and the Herbalife (HLF) short on which he lost $1B. Together, these two companies account for over 80&#37; of the underperformance over the last three years.

[He’s stated he has learned from these mistakes and will be going “back to basics” as an activist investor and avoiding the limelight going forward (i.e. no more public shorts and CNBC live-broadcast arguments with Carl Icahn)](https://www.reteurs.com/article/us-hedgefunds-ackman-exclusive/exclusive-ackman-cuts-staff-shuns-limelight-as-he-seeks-to-turn-around-fund-idUSKBN1FB32Y). His current portfolio seems to demonstrate this, consisting largely of solid, cashflow-generating businesses. While the quality of his current portfolio doesn’t pertain to this investment thesis, it is worth noting that PSH is extremely transparent regarding their investments and the research behind them, with much of their analysis being [found in annual letters here](https://www.pershingsquareholdings.com/company-reports/financial-statements/) or individual company reports. PSH’s portfolio is up 8.8&#37; this year versus 0.97&#37; by the S&P500.

**Comparables**

[In the US, the average closed-end fund trades at a 4.5&#37; discount to NAV.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4065639-closed-end-fund-discounts-continue-fall-cef-weekly-update) In fact, there is only one fund in the US trading at a similar discount to PSH and that’s Foxby (FXBY), a fund with a track record that doesn’t even come close to PSH’s with only about $5M AUM and [\-5.12&#37; annual returns since inception](https://www.cefconect.com/fund/FXBY).

Indeed, the most similar firms can be seen as Carl Icahn’s investment fund IEP and Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, both of which have similar long-term track records to Ackman. Indeed, IEP has yielded an annualized rate of return of approximately 7.5&#37; since 2004 ([source: page 15 of this presentation](https://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/IEP_nov_2016_-_Investor_Presentation_FINAL.pdf)) and Berkshire Hathaway 9&#37; return since 2004. In the same time period, PSH provided annualized returns of 13.7&#37; and yet it trades at a 23&#37; discount to NAV while IEP and BRK trade at 30&#37; and 40&#37; premiums to their respective NAV's.

**Catalysts**

1. Stock buyback — $300M stock buyback offer has been completed at a strike price of $13.47/share, reflecting a 20.5&#37; discount to NAV. While this had very little effect on the discount to NAV, it decreased free float and is likely to have a positive effect if demand for PSH shares go up following other catalysts. Also, it further increased insider ownership and commitment to improving PSH’s performance.
2. Insider ownership limit removed — PSH shareholders have voted to remove the 4.99&#37; insider ownership limit, thus allowing insiders to purchase more PSH stock and further narrowing the discount to NAV. [In the first 2 weeks of May alone, Ackman purchased 10,804,142 public shares at an average price of $14.79/share ($160M total) while Mr Botta (CFO of PSH) purchased 18,648 shares at an average price of $14 ($261,072 total)](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/media/2018/06/07105025/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-Announces-Purchases-of-PSH-Public-Shares-by-Bill-Ackman-and-Nick-Botta-and-the-Listing-of-Additional-Public-Shares-Due-to-Conversion-of-Management-Shares.pdf).
3. Personal investments by Ackman — Ackman himself has stated in the latest shareholder letter that he plans to invest significant personal funds (“several hundred million dollars”) into purchasing PSH stock over the next year. There are reports [he is selling luxury apartments from his successful real-estate venture in Philadelphia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/ackman-to-plow-luxury-apartment-gains-into-hedge-fund-buyback) in order to reinvest the money into repurchasing PSH stock.
4. No fees — While closed-end funds normally trade at a small discount to NAV due to fees charged (US closed-end funds trade at an average of \~4.5&#37; discount to NAV), PSH’s management agreement has a “high water mark” features such that investors only pay performance fees on increases in NAV above the highest NAV at a which a performance fee has recently been charged. As a result, investors will not be charged any performance fees until the NAV reaches the “high water mark” value of $26.37 per share. For reference, NAV is currently $18.75 and thus the next \~40&#37; of NAV appreciation will be fee-free.
5. Possibility of liquidation- As a result of the above “high water mark” feature, [some analysts have speculated that PSH management may eventually be incentivised to liquidate the fund in order to start a new one where they could immediately earn performance fees.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4127867-pershing-square-holdings-hedge-fund-available-23-percent-discount) If this is the case, investors would realise an immediate gain equivalent to the discount to NAV (currently 23.5&#37;). It is worth noting that, unlike many hedge funds, PSH’s portfolio doesn’t include any venture investments or other illiquid investments and in fact consists only of highly liquid securities.
6. Improved performance — Performance is improving as PSH is up 19&#37; this quarter and 8.8&#37; this year, compared to the S&P500 which is up 0.37&#37;.
7. Lawsuits settled — Alergan/Valeant insider trading lawsuits have now been settled, eliminating one of the major sources of uncertainty regarding PSH stock price and allowing Ackman to focus solely on delivering alpha.
8. Size of fund — Ackman currently manages around $8B in assets (down from nearly $20B at his peak), making the set of available investment opportunities much larger and potential returns far greater. As Buffett says, “size is the enemy of performance” in investment.
9. Personal factors — Ackman is clearly fiercely competitive and is unsatisfied with recent results. Many factors seem to point to the fact that Ackman is now back focussed and devoting himself fully to PSH. He has divested other investments in order to pour significant personal funds into PSH. He has delegated all marketing and PR duties to Ben Hakim in order to stay in the office focussing on financial analysis. In addition, the insider trading law-suits have now been settled and his divorce proceedings, initiated in 2017, are now concluded as well ([the financial ripping he reportedly took here may provide additional motivation to improve PSH’s results](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/bill-ackman-divorce)). Overall, many factors look to be lined up for Ackman to return to his winning ways and narrow the discount to NAV.

**Conclusion**

At this point, PSH and more specifically Bill Ackman are effectively distressed assets. The last 3 years of underperformance h[ave put Ackman hate at an all-time high, ](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/is-bill-ackman-toast)[new negative news pieces are written about him everyday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-pulling-bill-ackman-hedge-175352357.html) and [many in the industry are completely dismissing him as an investor](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4048464-ackman-investment-performance-still-horrible-pershing-square-risk). Indeed, this sentiment is perfectly encapsulated by One WallStreetOasis member who refers to him as Bill “destroyer of capital” Ackman.

As with most distressed assets, the rampant negativity prevents most people from looking deeper and analysing the situation objectively. In this case, I have argued analysis reveals an interesting investment opportunity; paying 77 cents on the dollar to gain access to an investor with one of the stronger long term track records (and who only a few years ago was called “Baby Buffett”) and who also seems to have learned from his recent mistakes as his portfolio is up 8.8&#37; this year. Add to this all the catalysts which should act to close the discount to NAV and I believe Ackman’s fall from grace provides savvy investors with a solid investment possessing a clear margin of safety.

t3_8zxujj,Changes at Himalaya Capital?,"Li Lu is a favorite investor of mine, and I've been curious about some of the big changes he's made in his operation lately.

**1. Huge inflow of capital from new investors**

Himalaya managed $2-3 billion for a number of years (their fund was closed for many years), but it now appears their asset base ballooned to over $9B in a very short period (according to their latest[ form ADV 2A](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/Common/crd_iapd_Brochure.aspx?BRCHR_VRSN_ID=487072)).

I view Li Lu as very deliberate, so this makes me wonder what he sees in China and his other relevant geographies. This capital was raised around March this year. 

Scaling an investment operation 3x is a huge endeavor, and it's very hard to build out a quality long book in a short period.

Li Lu even said himself in a Graham and Doddsville interview that any capital he takes in starts compounding at 6% per year (the preferred return for the fund before he earns any incentive fees, and his management fee is budget based, not % based), so he takes accepting capital very seriously.

**2. Himalaya office moved from Pasadena to Seattle.**

This is notable because Li Lu's mentor Charlie Munger lives in Pasadena, which is why he set up shop there.

t3_90e8o9,"Thoughts on Clearwater Paper (CLW), a leading private label tissue paper and paperboard","This company is down about 50% this year.

The reason may be due to a couple of factors:

1. The company is investing in a new factory to create ultra premium tissue paper. They are currently sold out of their current inventory, and so the new factory should help increase revenues. Problem is, this investment used up more cash than their annual operating income, so they had to tap their credit line for the outlay. I think
2. This led analysts to understand that the company may not be able to abide by all of their debt covenants. The company runs tight margins, but they do a good job with inventory turnover, and have increased revenues during previous recessions.

The company is trading below 2.5x Operating Cash Flows, 7x EV to EBITDA, and I think revenues and margins will improve in the subsequent years. I guess I don't know what will happen to commodity prices, which is an important factor for this business. Only 6x PE of the 8 year average earnings. Also, they are trading below book value for the first time, and about 1.27x tangible book.

I've learned only a little bit about this sector so far, does anyone hold an opinion about this company, or its competitors? The company claims that it is hard to make ultra premium tissue paper, and this gives them a durable competitive advantage. The company's assets could be taken over by a competitor, so I would give some credit to the book value of their assets.

The company is very shareholder friendly, when they have the cash available, with a tendency to do share buybacks when they don't have new capital investments to make. In other words, if they didn't choose to build the new factory in NC, they could have bought back about 30% of the current market cap this year.",6,0.68,1532075219.0

Company's debt recently got downgraded to BBB- (July 20 2018), prompted by downgrades to Turkey's own debt. More perceived risk for investors.

The company also announced that they will be terminating GDR and ADR programs. Less demand for shares.

There is a massive runway for them to continue growing in Pakistan (helps top line and margins). Shares seem reasonably priced relative to operating cash flows, the company is reinvesting in accretive growth throughout their markets. 

This looks like an interesting opportunity, especially considering the ADR delisting and the debt downgrade. That may or may not be priced in, but I would keep watching this stock on the Turkey exchange. It may continue to decline, in the face of improving fundamentals, which makes this an even smarter as a less liquid security.

I'm working on an investment thesis for work (sell-side). Once published my case will go to most of the street.  

There's a retail shareholder owning 3% of the company I'm looking at. I have found some information on him through his network of companies, doing some googling, and connecting the dots. I think I have a nice handle on who he is and his intentions. I have not found the means to reach out to this person yet. 

I respect other people's privacy; and this person seems to care a lot about it. He's a high net worth individual with ties to a media company and has avoided the public eye for most of his life. But now he is also an important part of the thesis. The note needs to be published soon (1-2 days) as it needs to be timely. 

I am thorn between disclosing what I know (for a better research piece) and writing a more ""vanilla"" piece. Alternatively I could try to reach out to that person, but I doubt he will be talkative. 

I'm not sure of the best course of action: 

* Do-my-work option: Publish what I've found out (and put this person's privacy on the line), 
* The ""high road""-option: Reach out to him, tell him what I have found and ask him to indicate his intentions, or
* Do nothing about it but keep the data for my own reference, and publish the vanilla piece

Any insights appreciated. 

I think it's quite a conundrum and I was wondering if any of you have been in a similar situation before.

t3_94ehcl,MTY Food Groups (MTY CN) Long Thesis,"First things first: this is my first time posting to this subreddit and would love any sort of criticism/feedback from you all. I've been lurking this sub (commenting occasionally) for quite some time but would love to be more involved in the future. I recently joined the Discord channel so hit me up there too.

#The Company
MTY Food Group is a small-mid market (~$1.4B CAD market cap at the time of writing this) Canadian quick service restaurant (QSR) company with operations in both the US and Canada. The company is centred around buying smaller, fragmented brands and licensing locations of said brands to franchisees. Among these brands are: 

-	Canada: Baton Rouge, Extreme Pita, ManchuWok, Mr. Sub
-	USA: Baja Fresh, Cold Stone Creamery, Planet Smoothie

*As well as many others.*

MTY currently earns the majority of its revenues from its franchisees via royalties and fees. Approximately 55% of revenues come from Canada, with 45% of revenues coming from USA locations. This capital-light revenue model allows the company to reinvest the cash from thriving restaurants into further acquisitions. Historically, the company has been able to operate this model with huge amounts of success while maintaining a Debt/Equity ratio of ~50% as of Q2 2018. 

#Thesis
MTY Food Group acquires companies with a very strong ROIC, typically in the mid-high teens, allowing the company to earn higher rates of return than same-store sales growth (SSSG) alone would typically provide. Further, MTY typically focuses on smaller acquisitions, and benefits from the overall fragmentation of the North American fast-food and QSR industry. The company has a history using invested capital efficiently to compound growth for shareholders and will continue to do so over time.

The company is currently facing a discount in the market due to recent closing of stores and below-estimate SSSG. I believe that this discount is unwarranted:

-	Closing unprofitable locations creates a better path for growth in the long term.
-	SSSG is less important for MTY due to its highly acquisitive business model and overall brand diversification.

#Valuation
From FY2016 to FY2017, MTY experienced YoY revenue growth of 44%, primarily stemming from $248M cashflow to acquisitions in FY2016. My modelling assumed that the company will continue to make acquisitions at a consistent level over time during its growth phase, beginning with the LTM value as of Q118 and growing at a rate of 15% per year. This is a crucial figure for the company, as it is the main driver of growth and makes up the majority of CapEx. 

With high levels of investment, I modelled strong revenue growth to continue, ramping down from 30% in the projected FY2018 to 5% in FY2023 with a maturity growth rate at the current Canadian risk-free rate of 2.15%. This leads to suppressed FCFF in the growth phase of the company due to the high net CapEx, but high long-term FCFF once investment and growth both begin to taper. I believe that this projection is consistent with both management's strategy (the President & CEO owns 20% of the shares outstanding, motivating him towards long-term growth) and the company's past performance. 

My discount rate was the WACC of the firm, which I found to be 6.14%. This includes a 3% company risk premium assigned to the Cost of Debt due to the nature of the business model. 

Here are the numbers that my model returned, as well as some ration analysis compared to the Restaurants industry averages in the USA:

####Valuation

Price/Book | 2.37 | 77.39
5Y Avg. Rev Gr | 24.22% | 14.11%
Operating Margin | 36.60% | 14.55%

#Risks and Conclusion
My investment thesis for MTY hinges on its ability to deploy capital into exceptional companies into the future. To support this thesis, management (CFO) has been quoted as saying they are unlikely to run out of companies to acquire, specifically in the USA, because of the fragmented nature of the industry and low barriers to entry. I would agree with that statement, and see it as probable that the company will be able to thrive from this growth. 

However, things can go wrong - if MTY is not able to continue to make value-creating acquisitions, this investment thesis will not hold up. With the compelling margin of safety provided by the fulfillment of this thesis, as well as the low valuation ratios relative to other firms in the industry, I am comfortable making that bet on the company and its management.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the quality of this idea and my report.

t3_947vmk,Value Investing In Biotech,"Like the rest of you here, I am a firm believer in value investing.  However, I am also a scientist, so unsurprisingly the most interesting companies that I find myself analyzing are biotechnology/pharma (at this point, all pharma companies are heavily focused on biotechnology). Looking for ""value"" in biotech, , mainly those on the smaller cap side, faces a number of challenges- so I figured that I'd ask those of you here for your thoughts on the subject (the biotech sector did not exist when the last edition of The Intelligent Investor was written).  

Some of the challenges facing investors are analogous to those presented by traditional tech companies (how do you project growth, dealing with negative cash flow, etc).  However, I think there are a number of unique and more daunting challenges.

The main question that I have is the following:
Is it possible to invest in small cap biotech as a value investor?  
I think that the answer to this question has to be yes, in part because one of the more notable value investors (Michael Burry) had a number of early stage biotech companies in his portfolio. The corollary to this question is of course how one can do so. 

Because of the limited duration for exclusivity of drugs once they reach the market (~8 years), projecting the future value of a company is heavily dependent on the pipeline in clinical trials and under preclinical investigation.  For larger companies, preclinical studies are highly secretive and especially difficult to analyze. 

The first approach to consider is to try to predict clinical trials. 
I find this to largely be a fool's errand, not because it is impossible to do so, but more because I think the chances of beating the market/identifying value here are slim. 

The second approach that I have considered is to focus on early biotech startups.  I think that identifying companies focusing on unique/interesting scientific areas, mainly with technology that can serve as a platform for multiple avenues of target investigation-while ignoring the biotech IPOs that are rehashing old strategies or focused on a single drug/target- can serve as a means to provide value.  I also now only buy if the price of the company is below the IPO price or near the 52 week low.

My main qualm with this second strategy is pricing-what makes a company with only preclinical or phase 1 data worth 300 million vs 200 million vs 1 billion?  

I am happy to list specific examples of companies for further discussion if anyone here is interested. Thank you for your thoughts.  ",23,0.84,1533285376.0

The company disposed 100% of its shares in X for total cash consideration of $10 million. Net assets disposed of where $9 million and fees were like $0.5 million resulting in a small gain on sale.


The kicker is a footnote on the net assets disposed that states:

**""net assets disposed of included cash and cash equivalents of $32.1 million and current liabilities of $23.3 million.""**


So the company received $10 million in cash but also gave up $32 million in cash that was offset by some obscure liabilities. 


Any ideas why a company would do this transaction? The acquired company was a captive insurance vehicle that insured discontinued operations.

Has anyone been following party city? Stock is down 5% today. 

I think people think that their business is dying and that their announcement to start selling on Amazon is a bad sign.

However, I think selling on Amazon will result in increase revenue. I  have sold items on Amazon and the fees will not be that bad at all. In addition, I highly doubt Amazon will start selling costumes  anytime soon.

Yes people have little brand loyalty when it comes to costumes, but Amazon has many more year-round sellinv items to start making on their list before costumes.

Also, if costumes have such low barriers to entry, why does party city have so few competetiors. Walmart and Target are well aware of the opportunity and always have been.

I also think the Toy City is a very good idea that will help increase revenue. There still is something about buying a toy from a store and a costume.

Costumes only make up a portion of their revenue. I believe plasticware is more...but that's a whole other topic...

I also did a reverse DCF. The market does not think party city will grow much.i am not sure I did it correctly. For net assets I subtracted all liabilities with assets (not including intangible assets, patents, etc.)
To that I added the value from NPV function in Excel with a 2.93% discount rate. I think the net income growth rate I obtained for ~10 years into the future was ~15%

Does anyone have any reports on this company?
What else should I look at? 


Does it have too much debt.

Also, why do they have so much inventory? 600 Mill seems like a lot and I am worried some of it is old stuff that no one will buy anymore like Mitt Romney costumes or something like that.

Of these, nearly 60% were subscribed by insiders (I.e. directors and senior ranking staff) even though prior to the rights issue they collectively owned some 20% of the company. Prior to and following the rights issue insiders bought nearly 4% of stock outstanding on the open market as well and another 5% via off market transactions.

The two reasons given for the rights issue was to pare down debt and for larger working capital as they wanted to increase export sales to Europe. Rights issue occurred in early Q4. The Q4 financial reports show debt has been pared down as outlined in the rights issue proposal.

In Q1, there was actually weaker financial results YoY. I guess whatever plans they had to increase export sales needed time to materialise. But the most interesting thing is that their inventory numbers had jumped up over 20% QoQ and was at the highest level ever.

Now Q2 results should be out in the next 2 weeks. I’ve been thinking about it all...are the higher inventories in Q1 a sign that management increased production in anticipation of greater sales in Q2 as they had buyers to sell to, or is it a sign that they failed to find these buyers in Q1 and as such their expansion in export plans may have failed?

t3_97329a,My first investment (finally!),"The stock?


Debenhams (LSE:DEB). Of the many people I have spoken to both online and IRL about this, only one person also agreed that it offered potential. Everyone else said that retail was dead, Debenhams was a terrible pick within a terrible market and that I was stupid. I think therefore it's safe to say I've fully taken on-board Mohnish Pabrai's advice in Dhandho Investor to 'buy distressed businesses in distressed industries'.


The investment merits as far as I am concerned are:

•	Other UK bricks & mortar retailers going into administration is creating worry and depressing the stock prices of other retailers.

•	I believe that their business strategy to drive more footfall and cut excess footage by utilising space for gyms and restaurants is a very good idea.

•	There is a focus on Beauty within the business, an industry segment that is growing rapidly.

•	Strong e-com growth, and the CEO, Sergio Bucher, being ex-Amazon gives me confidence they'll continue to do well here.

•	The recent, heavy discounting by other retailers, including House of Fraser hurting profit is likely to reduce now that House of Fraser has found a buyer in Mike Ashley, a 29% owner of Debenhams. The two chains are now less likely to commit mutually destructive acts. Additionally, Mike Ashley is regarded as a great trader so having him as a prominent stakeholder is a plus.

•	Low profit margin, which can be useful in a turnaround business as a small increase in profit margin will have big a big impact on earnings.

o	This is also a big risk if profit margin decreases further, which is a real possibility if the pound continues to fall.


The downsides:

•	Earnings and cash flow have been decreasing for the last 10 years and this negative growth has accelerated in recent years.

o	I believe that the new strategy of the business will begin to turn it around and that if earnings do not grow, the stock is still so undervalued that the investment should still not lose money.

•	There is no discernible durable competitive advantage that stands them out from other big UK retailers.

o	Debenhams has good physical locations across the country and a growing online presence. Due to the relatively straight-forward nature of retail, they will be able to copy the strategy of other retailers if the concept is proved. Bucher’s strategy however is time-consuming to implement and as they will be the first retailers to get a sense of whether or not it worked, they will be in a good place to fully implement this before the arbitrage opportunity of having restaurants/gyms in-store disappears.

•	The overall UK bricks and mortar retail sector is performing poorly and with the ever-growing e-commerce industry posing a huge threat, there is a chance that a snowball effect takes place with high streets emptying resulting in lower footfall and causing more shops to go out of business.

o	The strong e-com growth Debenhams has shown means that if more and more consumers choose to buy their fashion online, it should be able to grow sales further through this channel.


The value:

Share price at purchase = 11.7p (Mkt Cap = £144m)

Estimated earnings for year-end September 2018 = £28m (=£35m PBT * 80%).

LY basic EPS = 4p

At a PE of 5 using estimated earnings (3 using LY earnings) compared with a 5-year median PE of 9.8, the stock is undervalued compared to its historic self and very undervalued compared to its peers.

Mike Ashley paying £90m for a private company with a similar, albeit a bit more high-end, offer to Debenhams that is currently unprofitable and requiring a CVA to continue trading suggests to me he would value Debenhams at a lot more than £144m. In fact, he did value Debenhams at significantly more than £144m when he built up his 30% stake.

The analysts’ consensus of £28m earnings would give a profit margin of 1.2% (assuming revenue stays constant with LY). A 0.1% increase of profit margin would result in an 8% earnings growth, whilst a return to the 5-year median profit margin of 3.7% would yield 208% earnings growth.

I currently believe the stock could easily climb to at least 40p if the company’s strategy allows it to return to revenue growth. Even if this is not the case, the astute trading mentality of Mike Ashley could hopefully provide similar results by increasing profit margin from its current all-time low.

t3_970cdh,Clothing/shoe trends and future revenue,"I am a novice and I am just trying to learn.

I am pretty young and think I pay attention to what brands are trending among people my age...I think people my age are called ""Millennials."" 

I recently read about Vans spinoff plans which I think **may** be a good company to invest in. I say ""may"" because it seems that clothing brands rise to popularity and then fall and then rise. 

 I remember about ten years ago they were a bit of a thing--when all those Tony Hawk games came out. 

I see this with many brands...they become popular *again* or become popular *all of a sudden*  and then lose popularity.

Stan Smith shoes are an example of this: they became much more popular in the past few years, after being popular many years ago. Also, Nike airforce shoes became very popular about 10 years ago and died out agian.

We also all saw what happened to Abercrombie & Fitch: when I was younger literally everyone wore A&F. Gap,  Aéropostale, etc. 

Of course, these are global brands so what I saw in my section of the USA, may mean nothing.

It seems that clothing companies are on some sort of popularity cycle which increase revenue and elevate the stock price. Of course trends don't die out all of a sudden, so it is not like a stock would crash. 

I would think when investing in clothing companies it is best to invest in companies that you think will be strong for ever. I would say Levi's jeans is a classic company that will probably be around for a while. 

I think another good strategy may be to spot the growing trends, but this could be considered speculation. Clothing forum data, Website visit data, credit card data, social media data, etc. could probably spot these trends. 

**So my question**: does anyone know of any research where I can learn more about clothing trends and investing in clothing companies when they may just be ""hot"" for a short while. What mindset should you have when estimating future revenue for clothing companies? How do make sure something is not just a short trend?

I am curious about the brand loyalty of millennials. I feel like with older people, you see they have been buying the same brand their whole life. Some of this may just be a habit or fear of changing. For example, Calvin Klein underwear is not the cheapest or the most comfortable, but people stick to it, Gold Toe socks, etc. Any readings on this would also be helpful.

(Tangent: I wish I was not afraid to invest in Fast Retailing Co. because it was foreign.  I feel like Uniqlo may be a brand people stick to forever: well priced, basic products that are comfortable and work well.)

t3_97x27i,Value investing & microcap stocks,"The protagonist of The China Hustle, Dan David co-founded a microcap investment research firm called GeoInvesting with a man named Maj Soueidan.

Maj's main argument for investing in microcaps seems to be 'information arbitrage'; there are far too many microcaps and not enough analysts covering them to provide investors a better chance of discovering a price mis-match.

The extent of the inefficiency of a market directly correlates with the opportunities available for value investors looking for mis-priced equities. So, perhaps US or UK microcaps actually offer a safer opportunity than Mohnish Pabrai's current strategy of looking for overseas inefficient markets in India, Japan, Korea where there is a greater chance that you don't fully understand the macroeconomics or day-to-day culture of the host nation.

Clearly there is an issue that these companies won't have a long-track record of financial performance that you can analyse, but that aside, what are the main drawbacks of this strategy?

My initial reaction was just 'oh, penny stocks are risky and they're for chumps', but that's a pretty poor answer.

Does it automatically make a company more risky just because they have a low market cap? Intuitively I would think that the pace at which a competitor could take market share from your target company is probably a lot higher and thus from one earnings report to the next you could experience huge changes in intrinsic value, but provided you're well-read on the industry and it's in your circle of competence then you could conceivably get ahead of this in enough of your investments to still on balance make decent returns.

t3_985nss,End Of Brand As A Competitive Advantage,"Currently writing a report on decline of ad industry, it’s impact on consumer brands and the rise of its largest competitor - Amazon

I don’t want to just dump my post in here, so I’ll go through some of my ideas in shorthand. Would love to hear counter-arguments!

Can’t claim all ideas are my own. I’ve taken some from Scott Holloway, but put them in context of ad industry and consumer goods.

Advertising Is A Tax

-on poor people (not paying for Spotify)
-it’s becoming less and less effective 
-regular advertising ‘artificial stories’ can’t compete with digitally native vertical brands (DNVBs - brands which own their supply chain and run tight social media operations (e.g. Dollar Shave Club-esque companies) 
-DNVBs have an advantage, because story-telling costs nothing if done well on instagram, Snapchat or through publicity stunts
-there’s a reason Kylie Jenner’s on track to be liming billionaire - she has more intimidate relationship with audience 

Amazon Own Brand Could Swallow Unilever, P&G etc

-they can produce their stuff at a far lower cost:
1. They cut people out of the supply chain 
2. They don’t need to pay 6-8 bill on kn marketing like big guys, they can advertise on their platform for nothing
3. Their own-brand products are high quality 
4. They will make big companies paying an advertising tax, a supply chain tax and an AWS web tax to use their services. The net result is their products will be cheaper but equally as good 

Spirit Of Innovation 

Consumer goods companies spend almost nothing on innovation. They assume that their brands will keep selling that’s the way it’s always been. Amazon is innovation essentially.

Supply Chain Infrastructure 

-Amazons SCI is dramatically better than the one currently used by consumer goods companies. 
-As Prime grows in popularity, brands will be forced onto Amazon’s platform. 
-Amazon is a false friend, because it will eventually want to promote its own products

I’m not saying Unilever, P&G are instant sells. But I struggle to see how their are 20 year ‘sure-things’. Even look at buffett talking about kraft Heinz recently, I listened to his analysis and honestly struggled to understand anything he was saying. Kraft Heinz looks like an absolute disaster, even with the 3G Midas touch it’s a shambles.

**Annual Letter - Permanent Losov Capital - Ivan Losov**

Dear investors,

You may have noticed that the value of your investment has fallen by roughly 50% this year (49.5% to be precise).

In this letter, I will explore my successes over the past year and give investors an insight into the Permament Losov Capital forumula. I do not ask for praise, nor do I reject it.

2017 was a tough year. We expect 2018 to be on the same level of toughness, possibly tougher - but not that tough. Lets take a look.

**Theme One - Surge In Global Manufacturing**

We were disappointed by the performance of our US manufacturing theme. US manufacturing has experienced a century long decline. According to our research, the industry was gradually declined 122 years YoY and it has been in recession since 1972.

For this reason, we believe the industry is positioned for a turnaround and we are going to capitalise on it. We are shorting almost every stock that isn’t US manfucturing and we are willing to suffer significant drawdowns until we are proven corrent.

We accept drawdowns are a core element to our strategy and are perfectly willing to accept the loss of your capital.

**Theme Two -** **Incinerated Funds**

Our second theme is a little obscure, however we believe the returns could be promising in the long-term

During an investment conference this year, we heard a hedge fund manager speak about the rise of cryptocurrency. To quote him directly, he said:

“I will never invest in Bitcoin. I would much prefer to set my money on fire”.

I must admit that our firm has never considered the incineration of funds to be an appropriate use of client capital, neverthless we are always on the lookout for avenues of growth in this space.

This may prove to be a growth opportunity in this space – of growth.

**Theme Three - Global Shorts**

We believe the most exciting investment theme is our global shorts theme. We live in an increasingly unpredictable world, however there are a few things we can accept as universal truths:

1. The planet is getting warmer
2. Climate change is generating hotter days
3. People wear shorts on hot days.

Using a 500 year quantification of global heat-measured interfaces, we have estimated that this summer will be 2 degrees colder as a result of *lots of things* happening in the climate. We plan to capitalise on this opportunity and our idea is very simple. We are going to short shorts. Before we analyse our position, lets turn to our current shorts macro model.

**What do we know about shorts?** Shorts are a [garment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garment) worn over the [pelvic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pelvis) area, circling the [waist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist) and splitting to cover the upper part of the legs, sometimes extending down to the knees but not covering the entire length of the [leg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg).

They do not cover the leg entirely and that is key to remember for this trade – *they do not cover the leg entirely.*

If global temperatures are on track to decrease by 2 degrees this year, we have every reason to believe that the purchase of shorts will be in decline this year. In this event, shorts companies will default on their loans triggering a shorts crisis. We list below the companies which we intend to shortsell:

• Shorts International

• UR Shorts

• Shorts N’ UR Phat G-Strings

We believe there are opportunities in this space – we don’t intend to waist them (pun).

**Theme Four - Snapchat**

Investors may remember an incident when the board placed a veto on my decision to invest almost 90% of the fund in a snapchat investment product.

I remember joking with the executive team that I would fire them as a result of this incident!

And I did - they leave tomorrow.

Investors were concerned that I was investing in a business that was earning no money and I knew nothing about. Investors also pointed to snapchat’s continuous decline in value since their IPO, telling me that snapchat would almost certainly lose money in every quarter ahead until the business was physically shutdown.

This insight proved to be absolutely correct - our fund lost a third of its value in the last three days.

Our overall performance in Q1 was -30%. This was a 15% increase from Q1 the previous year (-45%). This means we have recorded 15% growth year-on-year.

But we won’t be patting ourselves on the back just yet. Our fund prides itself on long term performance. As Mr Buffett said himself:

“Be greedy when others are thankful and thankful when others are greedy”.

**Housekeeping**

Investors have raised their concerns about the lack of female representation at board level. The dominance of males may be explained by the fact that I am now the only person on the board and I do not plan on hiring anyone else. Still, these figures are not good enough – there is still work to be done.

I thank you all for taking the time.

Yours in growth,

t3_994qun,Personal experiences of spin-offs?,"Just finished the Spin-off portion of Joel Greenblatt's Stock Market Genius and as the examples are all very old I'm keen to hear some more recent anecdotal evidence.

What are some spin-offs over the last five years that you have invested in (parent or spin-off) or simply followed closely and what did you learn?

For those that haven't read it, Greenblatt suggests that Spin-offs as a whole offer around 10% better annualised returns than the general stock market and that well-chosen spin-offs will outdo that, meaning that you could nip at the heels of Warren Buffett after reading around 100 pages of his book and keeping up-to-date with business newspapers.

Specifically, he says to look out for three opportunities:

1) Investors don't want the spun-off company and it has nothing to do with the investment merits. This will be mainly due to institutional investors having their hands tied by their investment strategy (e.g. only S&P500 companies or the spin-off sitting in a different industry/sub-category).

2) Insiders want it. This can be discovered from the various documents around the spin-off. Companies have to give a reason for the spin-off and if it is to give key employees more equity-based incentives then you should be very interested.

3) An underpriced asset or business is revealed due to the spin-off. He gives Sears as an example of this. Supposedly the spin-off they undertook revealed that you could buy the US domestic arm of Sears for tiny multiples of earnings/sales.",9,0.74,1534869720.0

Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) is a holding company that derives its revenue from a growing and diverse portfolio of high-quality, high-active share, investment managers they call affiliates.  These affiliates generate revenue, represented by an expense ratio (fees/AUM). AMG runs 836 billion in AUM. This is just about 3x their 2007 size and 9.3x their 2000 size. 

The management team is shareholder friendly and the business will be able to reinvest its earnings for a very long time. The stock has not participated in the general market multiple expansion of the last 5 years and has not yet recovered to previous high's despite record earnings. 

**Business Overview:**

AMG owns non-controlling equity or full ownership of boutique actively managed investment firms, known as affiliates. A boutique is defined as 10% or more owned by employees, less than 100 billion in AUM, high active share, and at least a 5 year track record. Active share is a measure of the percentage of stock holdings in a manager's portfolio that differs from the benchmark index. 

This is further broken into 550 unique investment products. 75% of AUM is derived from institutions and high-net worth individuals. About 50% of AUM is domiciled outside the U.S, which surpasses many peers by orders of magnitude. Crucially, most of this AUM is in separately managed accounts ""SMA's"". SMA's have the advantage of being more difficult to withdraw from, but they also demand less fees - it focuses on maintaining the longevity of investor capital rather than trying to squeeze out as much fees as possible.

AMG offers an appealing platform for independent firms: Unlike Legg Mason or Federated, AMG does not re-brand or interfere with the investment culture of any affiliate. In fact, AMG has emphasized a desire to maintain each affiliate's culture and retain investment and management teams. AMG will try to help it grow by providing access to their international distribution channel and outsourcing marketing, reporting, and other administrative functions as a supplementary service.

Execution of this mandate is best illustrated by the length of time affiliates have been in AMG's portfolio, which often spans more than 10 years, the accompanying track records, and AMG's continued ability to attract high-caliber investment firms to partner with (the last 2 years provides numerous examples). Acquisition success likely attracts more talent, creating contagious network effects. Employment contracts with newly acquired affiliates can require up to 10 years of commitment from incumbent management, ensuring acquired affiliates are aligned with a long-term outlook. Often times AMG will optionally provide a seed investment in the fund itself to sweeten the deal.

AMG reportedly has 1500 existing relationships with potential acquisition targets that over the course of many years have been developed.

AMG's investment injects affiliate owners with liquidity but also leaves them with significant rights to future cash flows, an attractive deal for owners looking to potentially move on or think about succession. The latter is not a unique quality per se, but AMG has a significant edge in consummating deals given their decades long practice doing it vs peers who’ve only recently started.

AMG may also be one of only a few asset managers with capacity or wherewithal to acquire sophisticated investment firms looking for a permanent lot to park their businesses. I was surprised to see that Legg Mason and Federated Investors are the only other players who’ve been active in M&A over the last 5 years. Larger players like BlackRock are letting their active divisions go and focusing on passive, quantitative, and in-house development, so is Invesco and State Street, but T. Rowe, Gamco, Eaton Vance, and some of the smaller competitors have yet to prove themselves formdiable. I suspect there’s some form of potential cannibalization with existing funds that would occur if those kinds of firms were to acquire affiliates.

Finally, the CEO, Sean Healey, has been with the company since 1995, was promoted in 2005 to CEO, became Chairman in 2011. He has a Harvard Law background and considered going into academia. He possesses 117,000 shares and has a large portion of his compensation made out in equity. He’s still only 55 and has over 20 million of his wealth locked up in AMG’s stock. Since current management took over, the team has demonstrated prudent decision making and resilience in the face of crises; they are time weathered. Recent conference calls indicate they are scaling back acquisitions, especially in private equity as they see valuation multiples stretching out.

**Absolute Valuation:**

AQR:

Around 15% of AMG’s EPS and 25% of AUM is due to AQR. Acquired in 2004, this firm has grown AUM 23.6% annually since and currently employs 815 people and runs about 195 billion. Industry forecasts suggest AQR will grow AUM 15-20% annually for the next 5-10 years. The result: 3-5% boost to AMG’s earnings annually so by 2023 AQR would have about 600 billion in AUM and 6$ of contributing EPS. Quantitative firms are one of the very few sectors in the active investment industry that is growing rapidly. AMG is obviously aware of this, management has discussed it on conference calls. Quant firms have grown AUM from around 7% in 2014, to around 14% in 2017.

Core Affiliates:

Firms include: Tweedy Browne, ValueAct, Winton Capital, Harding Loevner, Blue Moutnain Group, and various non-controlled and controlled affiliates. 

85% of EPS and 75% of AUM is comprised of this group. I assume a below trend, 1-1.5% AUM organic growth rate for the next 6 years. Some of these funds have tripled or quadrupled since partnering with AMG over their life, indicating that either AMG is able to identify promising affiliates, or indicating that they have a network and resources that significantly benefit affiliates. 

In virtually all affiliate relationships, AMG has optionality to increase ownership and or the owners may “put” their equity to AMG at certain time intervals if certain performance criteria are met. 

This is important because it enables AMG to reinvest earnings into and throughout a deep and growing pool of existing investment manager relationships. Additionally, non-controlled affiliates, represented by equity method income, seem to be providing much higher expense ratios than AMG’s consolidated affiliates - perhaps because the consolidated affiliates are weighted down by mutual fund expense ratios, whereas the new investments are directed toward higher charging funds. 

The bottom line is that current expense ratios have defensible characteristics, (see risk section). AMG has optionality to stabilize them in the near-term via reinvestments into higher fee managers.

While my estimated growth rate for core affiliates is significantly below historical trend, it could easily be lower if passive index funds somehow begin compounding faster than the last few years of 12% annually. However, AMG has levers to avoid competing with passive as a growing 39% of AMG’s core is in alternative funds. 

Acquisitions: 

If an average of 650 million is spent each year for the next 6 years, EPS would increase roughly $4.50 by 2023. AMG has historically compounded AUM at roughly 15%, but a large part of that was acquisitions related. AMG has averaged 667 million in capital expenditures annually since 2010, adding on average 3-4 new affiliates per year. Management guides that for every $100 million spent on growth, there should be $.1 to $0.14 of EPS accretion. Financially able, AMG has generated over 1 billion in FCF before acquisitions each year since 2014, and reduced leverage, essentially leaving the business with $468 million in cash and declining interest expenses.

Shareholder friendly initiatives: 

In the first 6 months of 2017, AMG repurchased around 1.33 million shares for $200 million, repaid $85 million in debt, and initiated a $44 million annual dividend that could easily be 1-2%, but is currently a .5% yield and far below peers. Shareholder initiatives should add at least $1 in EPS cumulatively by 2023.

Summing up:

By 2023, I expect around $19.5 in GAAP TTM EPS plus at least a 1% dividend yield. On a 16x 2023 TTM earnings multiple I am getting a price of around $300. I did not calculate the more aggressive “economic earnings per share”, which in some cases is 5$ more than GAAP, but still trades on 14x valuation multiples.

Base case - 2023 outlook (5-year)

1. AQR AUM 190 → 600, EPS $1.9 → $6
2. Core AUM 575 → 620 billion, EPS $7.6 → $8
3. Acquisitions → $4.2 billion capex, EPS --> $5.25 

If you add it all up, by 2023: AUM 765 → 1,187 ex acquisitions, GAAP EPS $9.5 → GAAP EPS $19.25

**Relative Valuation:**

According to FactSet, AMG historically trades at an 8% discount NTM PE relative to the S&P 500. Today it trades at a 38% discount NTM PE relative to the S&P 500 and 23.5% discount to it’s historical “economic earnings” multiple of 14.23x. The last time valuation compressed like this was in 2008 and 2003. They trade roughly in line with “peers” on an absolute basis. 

On a relative valuation, the market is trading at a 61% premium while growing 20% slower! Factset reports a market 3-year forward pe of 14.5x and 11.6% EPS growth rate vs AMG’s 8.65x EPS and 13.3% growth rate. AMG also trades well below its historical average.

**Risks:**

They have historically incurred a lot of debt to grow: 6.2 billion issued since 2012. But they’ve also generated 5.3 billion over the same period in operating cash flow. They don’t issue debt every year however and they don't to given their low fixed costs capital structure - they only rasie debt when they expect to make acquisitions, which has been the situation over the last 5 years and will likely repeat itself over the next 5 years if there's consolidation in response to industry difficulties.

Consolidation will be catalyzed from active management outflows and increased regulation. There’s been a notable uptick in consolidation within the broad sector already. Peers like Legg Mason, Federated Investors, BlackRock or even major bank holding companies like Goldman Sachs’ asset management division have gone through significant M&A activity. To sum up, especially for active managers, there’s a necessity to consolidate in anticipation of losing AUM to passive products and to gain some scale or safety from expected increased regulation like the DOL fiduciary rule or brokerage commissions transparency.

A stock market shock isn't life-threatening. AMG has proven to be highly stable over long-periods of time. In 01 and 09 AMG's business temporarily collapsed via outflows, cash flow returns on total capital fell by 50%, and 30% respectively, from the prior year. That said, pre-tax margins never fell below 15% and AMG has historically added the majority of their AUM in the aftermath of recessions. Despite two of the possibly worst market bubbles in US history, they’ve compounded FCF at 15% annualized since 1999.

There should be concern about the longevity of active managed funds but investors should also carefully consider the stickiness of client interests in AMG’s existing portfolio and the quality of affiliates themselves. The constituent base is growing in institutional and in alternative allocations, but even the retail base is in mutual funds have outperformed the market over the life of those funds.

Expense Ratios:

Expense ratios will likely deteriorate over the long-term. For every basis point of expense ratio deterioration, AMG will lose more revenue for basis point lower. But, the extent of damage to AMG should be muted by the alternative portfolio, AQR, and the high-quality core affiliates. Furthermore, expense ratio deterioration, while it has been trending down, is not that bad. 

ICI indicates that expense ratios have deteriorated at about 1.67% per year for equity mutual funds since 1996, translating to an average of 2.1 basis points per year. The caveat here is that AMG is diversifying into active alternatives which generally provide both uncorrelated performance, command higher fees, and have longer lock-up periods. The result of their strategic foray into alternatives in recent years has set them up for better long-term durability and an improved expense ratio complex.

AMG’s aggregate expense ratio (Aggregate Revenue/ Average AUM) charged to clients was .66% in 2016, but will likely remain stable to slightly increase in 2017 due to a transformative 2016 acquisition spree and positive hedge fund performance YTD. This compares to a .71% expense ratio in 2012, or a decrease of roughly 1.25 basis points per year. A closer look reveals that the expense ratio from consolidated affiliates has decreased from .47% to .33% or 3.5 basis points over the same period and expense ratios from equity method affiliates has decreased from .87% to .74% or 3.25% per year.

Why haven’t expense ratios decreased 3.3 basis points per year since 2012?

The reason overall expense ratios aren’t going down as quickly is because AMG has been acquiring equity method affiliates much faster than consolidated affiliates effectively stabilizing the expense ratio. Furthermore, 69.5% of Net Income available to common was derived from equity method affiliates, and roughly 60 billion in equity method affiliate AUM was acquired, which will show up in H2 17/H1 18 according to management.

Why are equity method affiliate expense ratios 40 basis points higher? How stable are they?

Equity method affiliates are largely composed of alternative strategies such as private equity and quantitative hedge fund firms, and thus can generally command higher premiums for performance than mutual funds, which comprise consolidated affiliate AUM. Equity method affiliate acquisitions have been a strategic focus for AMG’s management team because of the higher expense ratios achieved. All of 2016’s acquisitions were alternatives and I believe management will continue diversifying their portfolio into these kinds of strategies until they don’t need to.

**Other Notes (in no particular order, some are repetitive)**

● They generate predictable cash streams because of significant exposure to sticky separately managed accounts (SMA’s), which is approximately 75% of AUM. SMA’s are generally less liquid than an ETF, so in a sense slightly more stable than an index fund.

● During the first 15 years of existence AMG accumulated 381 billion in AUM, but another 390 billion has arrived over the last 5 years. In other words, they’re growing AUM at 3x the historical rate. It would be unjust to speculate why specifically, but I suspect AMG’s long track record of success and reputation was a catalyst.

● In 2016 AMG had a gross expense ratio of 65.5 basis points. This compares to a typical expense ratio of over 1% for the average mutual fund, a 60% premium to AMG’s, and a likely competitive factor against ETF’s.

● Returns on invested capital (acquisition expenditures primarily) are enhanced by management's’ ability to prudently acquire affiliates at good prices, return capital to shareholders when M&A is too hot, and score a few home runs along the way, i.e AQR.

● AMG is particularly attractive to international funds seeking a distribution channel into US capital, and likewise US investors can use international funds to access emerging markets expertise. Close to 50% of AUM is already domiciled out of the US and as of recently acquisitions seem to be more and more frequently sourced from abroad.

● Since AMG does not rebrand or interfere with the investment culture of their affiliates, often times when auctions occur prospective affiliates simply choose AMG at whatever price is offered

t3_9af9lg,Mulberry Short Thesis,"**Company Overview**

Mulberry is a UK based luxury fashion company that makes leather goods (90% of revenue), mainly handbags (70%). The company was founded in 1971, employs 1,400 FTE (mostly in the UK) and makes approx. 50% of handbags at two Somerset factories, employing 650 FTE. The rest of production is outsourced overseas. The business strategy is to continue growing handbag sales and in the long-term expanding into other categories including footwear, accessories and men’s leather goods.

**Financials**

Share Price = 434p

Market Cap = £257.8m

Revenue = £170m (5yr CAGR = 1%, 10yr = 13%)

Earnings = £4.9m (5yr CAGR = -23%, 10yr = 4%)

Equity = £88m (5yr CAGR = 2%, 10yr = 15%)

Profit margin = 2.9% (gross profit margin = 63.5%)

Charts: https://imgur.com/a/i1v2xm9

**The investment merits:**

•	Mulberry is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 52.5, despite an Earnings 5-year CAGR of -23%.

•	Revenue has only grown by 0.6% CAGR since 2013. This is driven by a steady drop in Wholesale revenue and little growth in total UK retail sales (as this composes digital and in-store sales, in-store sales revenue must be falling).

•	2018 Earnings of £4.9m are likely to be substantially lower in 2019 due to a number of reasons:

1) £3m cost associated with House of Fraser’s administration.

2) If as expected up to half of House of Fraser’s stores close, Mulberry’s wholesale revenue will also be significantly affected as House of Fraser concessions (21) represent 47% of Mulberry’s total concessions.

3) The company is launching into a partnership in South Korea that will entail c. £3m in costs in 2018/19. Whilst in the long-run this may be a strong revenue growth area for the company, in the short term it will have a negative impact on the bottom line.

4) Mulberry has stated that in the short term it plans to strategically refine and enhance its store network. This is likely to result in significant costs incurred over the coming financial years.

5) Mulberry has also stated that if the UK market continues as it is, the company’s full-year profit for 2019 will be materially reduced.

•	Compared to Burberry, probably the closest UK publicly traded company to Mulberry, the fundamentals look very poor, aside from Price to Sales and Price to Equity.

o	Price to Earnings: Mulberry = 52.5 | Burberry = 33.7

o	ROIC: M = 4.1% | B = 12.9%

o	Profit margin: M = 2.9% | B = 10.5%

o	Price to Operating Cash Flow: M = 22.6 | B = 14.3

o	Price to Sales: M = 1.5 | B = 3.6

o	Price to Equity: M = 2.9 | B = 6.8


**The downsides:**

•	International and digital revenue are both growing steadily, both growing at an 11% CAGR since 2013, which may partially offset the increased costs over the coming years.

•	The company has no debt, either short or long-term which will be helpful in weathering rough years.

•	The 5-year CAGR in earnings to 2012 was 46% (revenue = 28%). If the business returns to these rates, its current valuation is likely warranted.


**Summary:**

At a PE of 52.5 (PEG ratio = 98.9) using 2017/18 earnings, the business seems to me to be valued using the growth rates it experienced leading up to 2012. Additionally, the Return on Invested Capital of 4% shows that the business has not been successful in turning its capital into earnings over the last 4 years. I believe it is highly probable that 2018/19 earnings will be lower than 17/18 and as such investors will re-value the stock using recent years’ performance as opposed to the optimistic valuation based on previous years. Even a PE ratio of 30 and assuming no earnings decrease next year, the share price would still drop by 43%. (PE of 20 = 62%).

-----------------------------

Very keen to hear people's thoughts on this. **I do not actually plan on shorting the company** as I don't have the facilities to do this and generally don't want to engage in any gamble with a theoretically unlimited upside but will be following the story over the next year to see how this plays out.


One question I do have for more learned investors than myself on this forum is: the top 3 shareholders of Mulberry account for 92% of outstanding shares. After that and the Chairman's 1.2%, there are 4 million shares outstanding. Is this reduced liquidity likely a key factor in the company's high valuation? If so, should one of these stakeholders decide they want to invest elsewhere, would the stock price suffer a severe drop?

Reasons I'm currently not positive on the deal for Coke (subject to further work):

\- £3.9bn equates to 16.4x LTM March-18 EBITDA, well above research analysts' (generally optimistic) consensus valuation of the business of £2.3bn. How much of the distribution and other synergies did Coke ""pay away""? Having dealt with the notorious lead consumer banker at Rothschild before ([Akeel Sachak](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/akeel-sachak-6620a859)), likely all. He is known for many ""great"" UK consumer deals including Lindt's acquisition of Thornton's and the Premier Food roll-up before the rights issues and  recapitalizations. His involvement alongside the multiple is a red flag for me.

\-  The CEO pointed to 2 reasons why they decided to bring Costa into the Coca Cola family: ""(1) coffee is one of the strongest growing categories in the world; (2) Coca Cola needs to expand into coffee and hot drinks"". You can watch the strange video announcement [here](https://youtu.be/yTk1XzLYM9w). It seems like a British CEO that knows they need to diversify into hot drinks picked Whitbread's publicly announced ""for sale or for spinoff"" business as the most actionable target, rather than having any significant draw to the brand or unique value proposition of the business.

\- The Costa brand is confused in its positioning. It's quite basic in the UK; it's the largest mass market coffee house - supported in large part by it's image as ""decent coffee at decent prices"", ""home-grown"" and paying its taxes, unlike Starbucks (whether that's a fair assessment or not is debatable, but that's the consumer perception). It's even moving further down-market to vending machines in the UK. And in China, it tries to position itself as a premium option, with limited success. What Coca Cola plans for the brand is yet to be announced.

\- The coffee market, although fragmented, particularly in foodservice, is extremely competitive. Joh. A Benckiser (JAB), superb consumer sector operators from the Reckitt Benckiser family, are consolidating the premium end of the market, buying up niche coffee chain brands in the US, Scandanavia and internationally. They retain the brand and feel of the outlets, purely optimising the supply chain and back-office functions of each store, and providing necessary capital for aggressive roll-outs where necessary. Starbucks have also cornered key markets globally. Nestlé have been involved in recent M&A in the space, and dominate coffee sold through retail channels. Competing with these giants with such a small, UK-focused, mixed brand platform is questionable.",8,0.78,1535746979.0

t3_9coa4l,"GNC: Cheap Stock, Innovative Company. (Fisher/Graham Analysis)","Research never really ends. I'm starting to dive into GNC's financials going back to 2012 to get a more clear picture of their operating history. I'm not a professional, I'm barely experienced, so don't take this as investment advice. I am long GNC, and I do plan on buying more.

&#x200B;

TL;DR, GNC is a retailer, producer, and innovator of health related consumables. The stock is very cheap on a free cash flow basis. The company has an above average chance at maintaining market share in a rapidly growing sector.  I hope to learn more from you all.

I would categorize GNC as having a speculative capital structure, and with the current Market Cap, it has an outsized potential for gain in share price. The bulk of it's EV is about $1b of debt. The company has generated over $150m of free cash flow over the last few years, and predicts $100m free cash flow for 2018.  The market is awaiting a $300m equity investment to be approved by regulators, this will be used to pay down debt, leaving them with less than $700m of debt (which has been recently extended from 2019 to 2021). 

**Why is the market wrong?** I think there are non-investment factors affecting demand for the stock. 1. Retail apocalypse has pummeled nearly all physical retailers. 2. Negative EBIDTA and Earnings for 2 years in a row, due to non-cash write downs of intangibles & goodwill. 3. Operating margins are down about 50%, although this is a great reason to sell a stock, it's in oversold territory, if you believe operating margins can stabilize around here, cherry on top if they improve. 

&#x200B;

If the company passes a significant number of Fisher's 15 points, then this stock has a great likelihood of very significant appreciation. 

1. Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years? 

**Yes. GNC is one of the market leaders in the dietary supplements market, expected to be worth $278.02 Billion By 2024, a 9%+ expected CAGR from today. They participate in this market as a physical and online retailer, private label seller, and a contract manufacturer.**

2. Does the management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will still further increase total sales potentials when the growth potentials of currently attractive product lines have largely been exploited?

**Yes. GNC actively pursues new products by internal innovation as well as sourcing from other distributors. They may copy new products under proprietary brands to increase margins, but they also innovate new products internally that are not available in other places (such as the recent launch of Slimvance (although it only has sub-par ratings online).**

3. How effective are the company's research-and-development efforts in relation to its size?

**The company spends about $6-$8m per year in R&D expenses, compared to over $2b per year in revenues. They aren’t an R&D powerhouse, but have shown time and again that they are able to invent new products that the public consumes.**

4. Does the company have an above-average sales organization? 

**Definitely. Their physical retail presence is relatively ubiquitous in the US, and their eCommerce is growing very well. They have restarted their loyalty program and now have over 1m subscribers paying $40/year for extra benefits, this grew by 8% QOQ. Retail staff are motivated by sales goals that benefit the organization. There is competition from Amazon, but GNC has a robust presence on Amazon, and with their private label products, they are able to better control margins.**

5. Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin? 

**With gross margins compressed down to 33.6%, they have operating margins of about 8%. This is compared to higher margins over the last decade of about 36% gross and 15% operating. Interest expenses shave approximately 7% from the operating margins. So current earnings are not a highlight, but on an historical average basis the company is able to produce worthwhile margins.**

6. What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins? 

**The primary driver of higher margins is innovation in new products such as Slimvance, as well as catering to secular growth and new trends in the health goods marketplace. They are also optimizing their retail portfolio, with less than 2.5 years average lease term per location.**

7. Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations? 

**Glassdoor.com gives them a ⅗ star rating. Filtering for Current Full Time Employees, this increases to 3.2/5 and the CEO gets a 53% approval rating. Not excellent, and this could be a potential challenge in the company’s success.**

8. Does the company have outstanding executive relations? 

**The company changed CEO in 2016, and got the former RiteAid CEO. Considering where RiteAid’s operating history, it’s hard for me to get excited about their executive leadership, some of whom are only with the company since 2015-2017, while others are around since 2009.**

9. Does the company have depth to its management? 

**Not loving that the CEO came from outside the company. Historically, the company has looked to outsiders for making strategic changes in the business, including when it was a family owned business.**

10. How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting controls? 

**I think they are handling accounting controls well, I don’t see any reason for doubt here. GNC Holdings Inc has a Beneish M-score of -2.35 suggests that the company is not a manipulator. At the same time, GNC has a Z-score of 1.79, indicating it is in Distress Zones. This implies bankruptcy possibility in the next two years. (source: Gurufocus.com).** 

11. Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding the company may be in relation to its competition? 

**GNC is a respected brand name in the supplement industry, they have more unique branded products than competitors like Vitamin Shoppe.**

12. Does the company have a short-range or long-range outlook in regard to profits? 

**GNC certainly has a long range view of profits. They are undergoing changes to their business to modernize it for omnichannel sustainability, plus the new paying subscriber base is growing rapidly, which was started at the cost of closing down an older loyalty program.**

13. In the foreseeable future will the growth of the company require sufficient equity financing so that the larger number of shares then outstanding will largely cancel the existing stockholders' benefit from this anticipated growth? 

**The company has sufficient free cash flows to fund either business expansion or a return to shareholders.**

14. Does management talk freely to investors about its affairs when things are going well but ""clam up"" when troubles and disappointments occur? 

**I am satisfied with the company’s conference calls, no extra comments here.**

15. Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity? 

**GNC has been in business for 80 years, their recent performance, while less than stellar, appears to be honest. Insiders had been buying substantial amounts of the stock through the end of 2017, I would like to have seen these continue through 2018.

t3_9f7esg,Special Sits: Thoughts on CFIUS risk in merger arbitrage?,"Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone had thoughts on how they evaluate CFIUS risk when the buyer in a merger arb situation is a foreign buyer?  I am looking at the Radisys Corp situation. Basically they are at risk of going bust, but one of their major customers (Reliance Industries, based in Mumbai, India) made an offer to purchase them. The merger arb spread is close to 10% mostly because there is skepticism that CFIUS will approve the deal.  

It seems to me the main argument *for* CFIUS approval is that the company will likely be unable to raise equity and therefore will likely file for bankruptcy if it isn't bought. The assets have already been used as collateral against a previous loan, so purchasing the company is really the only way someone like Reliance can get their hands on the technology. That will definitely cause a loss of American jobs.  Selling won't cause a loss of American jobs for at least 1 year (the merger agreement stipulates unchanged salaries and wages for at least 1 year).

I am just curious if anyone has thought about how to evaluate this risk. In this case I am having a hard time determining if their technology is important for national security (I don't think so because they say they implement open source solutions) or if their is an ""India"" risk (similar to the ""China"" risk a CFIUS is basically poo pooing all deals from Chinese buyers).",7,0.89,1536756259.0

This is the first time I'm posting on this subreddit (or any part of reddit for that matter) - so forgive me if this is against the rules. (do let me know in comments if I should have posted this elsewhere/done it differently).

I generally work alone when it comes to stock picking, so I thought it might be interesting, to post some of my recent investment decisions (over last 6 months) to challenge some of my assumptions, learn new concepts form this community, and most importantly ensure I'm not ignoring obvious issues due to cognitive bias. I'm not going to post my returns on each investment, because I don't want that influencing thought in anyway. I'm going to go ahead and post my thesis (briefly) and have the community criticize/support/dissect/challenge. Appreciate the help!

Hawaiian Airlines (HA): Key reason - good company, trading cheaply. Investment caught my eye because of cheap valuations. Airline is rated most 'punctual airline' in the country, niche player that has 80% market share of interisland market. Beaten down due to news Southwest might enter the westcoast-hawaii market and the interisland market. Consistent growth (top and bottom line) over the last 10 years, with Roe of 40%+ and ROIC of 26%+ (on the higher side for industry). Is one of the few survivors of a very competitive market that has seen a lot of bankruptcies. FCF can be inconsistent in years when they are investing in new airlines, but on a steady state, typically generates 1x FCF/Net Income. My valuations: DCF put fair value 40-50% above current value. on a P/E basis, trading at 1.4x cheaper than competitors.

Standard Chartered Bank (Stan.L): Key reason - deep value.  An incredibly strong brand in emerging markets and a stalwart in ASEAN/China region. In 2014 bank went through turmoil that slammed top and bottom line. They were bending over backwards to do business with whoever would have them, and this led to several unprofitable business and severe fines and investigations from several countries (including the United States - Iran sanctions).  Mgmnt was reshuffled, and Bill Winters (ex JPM and seen at one time as potential successor to Jaime Dimon) is appointed in 2015 as CEO. He took an axe to the business, reshaping/selling/slashing. Top and bottom line have started to recover, but at time of investment P/B was trading at a 40-80% discount to comparative banks (depending if you compared them to Global, Asian, European, or American banks). Key catalyst for recovery from deep value: They need to bring their costs down.

Lear Corp (LEA): Key reason - Great company, trading at a healthy discount to fair value. Makes seating and electrical systems/parts for auto companies like Ford, GM, FCA. Consistent trajectory, growing 7-9% per year (top and bottom), FCF of $1.2bn, ROIC at 24%+ , last quarter was a record breaking quarter in terms of results. Second largest market share in industry. Moat is driven by stickiness of customers (Auto companies spend a long time on Due diligence, preproduction validation, etc before choosing a supplier), extensive R&D in 'smart' systems for cars (preparing for increase of electric or SDV), and efficient scale (production spread across the world to service clients globally). A high proportion of facilities located in low-cost countries which also gives it a cost advantage. My DCF valuation put it at 20-30% discount to FV, and P/E trading around 30% discount to competitor.

I have invested is some well known tech stocks, but theres enough info out there to challenge my assumptions if required. Thus have posted only on the lesser talked about ones. Looking forward to reading your thoughts.",12,0.87,1536807655.0
t3_9fdyzu,FNJN: A cheap patent troll - Long thesis,"**Background**

Finjan Holdings Inc. (FNJN) is a micro-cap, cyber security intellectual property licensing and enforcement firm. If you not familiar with IP licensing firms, think “patent troll.” Finjan currently owns 53 US patents and 38 international patents. Of these patents, 24 were recently acquired (Aug. 2017) from IBM to form a new partnership, and have yet to be monetized. The company has a few wholly owned subsidiaries, one of which sales a mobile VPN product to consumers and enterprises, another of which offers cyber security consulting services. Neither of which have ever earned any income. Finjan earns all its profits from licensing and enforcement. The company IPOed in 2014.

&#x200B;

**Financials/Valuation**

As of September 12, FNJN is trading around $4.05 per share with a market cap near $112 million and $65 million cash on hand. At 27.5 million of float, that is around $2.36 cash per share. Over the last 4 quarters they have generated $105.5 million in revenue and $60.5 million in EBITDA. It is a trading on an EV/EBITDA multiple is less than 1. By nearly every standard measure this is a cheap stock.

&#x200B;

**Why is FNJN cheap?**

The primary reason is the fact that Finjan’s income and expenses are highly uncertain and can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Many think that Finjan will have little success in winning new settlements and will spend all of its cash of long drawn out jury trials (a jury trial costs the company between $1 and $2 million per quarter). Additionally, as is, the firm’s theoretical earning potential is time-bound, as each patent has a lifespan. Altogether this makes Finjan a difficult company to value. However, for the reasons below, I think FNJN is an excellent buy.

&#x200B;

**Why Long?**
FNJN is cheap. While I don’t think too much consideration should be given to valuation metrics, FNJN is so cheap that it doesn’t have to perform all that well for the stock to outperform. The company is priced as if it will only win 1 or 2 medium sized settlement awards and will not increase any licensing deals in the next 2-3 years. If this is true, then you shouldn’t buy. On the other hand, if Finjan can win several settlements/awards in the next few years or increase licensing or secure new patents to extend the company’s time horizon, then the stock will appreciate considerably and you should buy. Below I present some evidence why I think Finjan will do better than most think as well as some additional considerations.

&#x200B;

**Increasing licensing and court awards**

· Finjan has aggressively pursued licensing and should increase revenue to $200-$400 million in the next 3-4 years from existing patents (based on the company’s projection). The company has increased annual revenues each of the last 4 years

· Most of the existing licensing contracts have “pricing protection” which could increase payouts based on the licensees’ use (some of this is included in the above figure)

· The FinjanBlue program with IBM has 24 patents that are untapped

· The company has a strong track record of defending patents and favorable court rulings. As this continues it could make competitors more willing to settle

· The company has proved many times that it can secure new patents and looks for well priced opportunities

&#x200B;

**Cash And Valuation**

· The board authorized a $10 million buyback program in FY18 Q2, $2 million of stock have already been purchased

· The company recognizes awards in the quarter when it was awarded, not when it was paid - meaning that cash on the balance sheet doesn’t reflect the full amount of earnings

· Finjan's management has shown a strong interest in returning capital to shareholders, including the possibility of one time distributions

**Other Considerations**

· There is a possibility of an acquirer or other partnership – the company's financials and portfolio make it attractive to competitors and the company has retained Atlas Technology (a Silicon Valley investment bank). As explained on the most recent earnings call “strategic options have presented themselves.” There are many larger IP firms or technology companies who could potentially seek a partnership or acquisition

· The business model should be minimally effected by market conditions as Finjan’s revenue is generated by “captive” payers (don’t like the term recession-proof)

· Finjan has the possibility to generate additional revenue from its subsidiaries. While I don’t place much faith in Finjan Mobile’s VPN product, it is currently undergoing a re-brand as “Invincibull” and the company is pursuing enterprise customers

· More promising is Finjan’s $5 million VC investment with JVP. Not only might this produce a solid return but also gives Finjan access to cutting edge cyber security tech

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

To sum it up, if Finjan can generate earnings anywhere close to what they have done recently then the stock should increase significantly. I am confident in management ability to aggressively license, enforce, and grow its IP portfolio. ",9,0.84,1536804193.0

t3_9i8njo,Tracking subtle changes in revenue recognition policies,"Sharing with this reddit community, the subtle changes in revenue recognition policy from a company I have been following.  Curious fellow redditors think of this change 

**2016** **Revenue Recognition**

We recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met:

1.   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

2.   delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;

3.   our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and

4.   collectibility is reasonably assured.

We record revenue when customers take delivery of products.  Customers may pick up products at any sales center location, or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers.  Products shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the shipping terms, which are generally FOB shipping point.  We include shipping and handling fees billed to customers as freight out income within net sales.

We offer volume incentives to some of our customers and we account for these incentives as an adjustment to sales.  We estimate the amount of volume incentives earned based on our estimate of cumulative sales for the fiscal year relative to our customers’ progress toward achieving minimum purchase requirements.  We record customer returns, including those associated with early buy programs, as an adjustment to sales.  Based on available information related to our customers’ returns, we record an allowance for estimated returns, which historically has not been material.  Other items that we record as adjustments to sales include cash discounts, pricing adjustments and credit card fees related to customer payments.

We also report sales net of tax amounts that we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities.  These tax amounts may include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value added and some excise taxes.

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09, *Revenue from Contracts with Customers* (ASU 2014-09) and subsequent amendments issued to provide clarifications on the new guidance.  We expect to apply the guidance using the cumulative-effect transition method.  Based on our analysis performed to date, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations but will result in additional disclosures regarding our revenue recognition policies.  ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which for us will be in the period beginning January 1, 2018.   

&#x200B;

**2017** **Revenue Recognition** 

We recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met:

1.   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

2.   delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;

3.   our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and

4.   collectability is reasonably assured.

Customers may take delivery of products in a variety of ways. Customers may pick up products at any sales center location, or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks; in these instances, we record revenue upon delivery to the customers. **We also deliver products through third party carriers, and  the product to the third party carriers**. Products shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the shipping terms, which are generally FOB shipping point. We include shipping and handling fees billed to customers as freight out income within net sales.

We offer volume incentives to some of our customers and we account for these incentives as an adjustment to sales. We estimate the amount of volume incentives earned based on our estimate of cumulative sales for the fiscal year relative to our customers’ progress toward achieving minimum purchase requirements. We record customer returns, including those associated with early buy programs, as an adjustment to sales. Based on available information related to our customers’ returns, we record an allowance for estimated returns, which historically has not been material. Other items that we record as adjustments to sales include cash discounts, pricing adjustments and credit card fees related to customer payments.

We also report sales net of tax amounts that we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities. These tax amounts may include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value added and some excise taxes.

Effective January 1, 2018, we will adopt ASU 2014-09, *Revenue from Contracts with Customers,* and subsequent amendments. Under the new standard, revenue will be recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation by transferring promised products to our customer. We expect to recognize revenue when control of the product has been transferred to the customer upon delivery to the customer or the freight carrier, if delivered by a third party, as we believe our performance obligation is satisfied at such point in time. This treatment is consistent with our current revenue recognition policies. **We evaluated our bill and hold sales under the new guidance and determined that revenue may be recognized earlier under ASU 2014-09**. However, at December 31, 2017, a cumulative catch-up adjustment related to bill and hold transactions would not be material due to the seasonal nature of our business. 

We reviewed our terms and conditions, marketing programs, coupons and customary business practices to determine if any variable consideration exists in our revenue transactions. We did not identify any arrangements that would cause different accounting treatment under the new guidance. The majority of our sales transactions do not require any additional performance obligation after delivery; therefore, we do not have multiple performance obligations for which we will have to allocate the transaction price. We will continue our accounting policy election to exclude from revenue all amounts we collect and remit to governmental authorities.

As allowed under ASU 2014-09, we will apply the guidance using the modified retrospective transition method, whereby we will recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings (deficit). Based on our analysis, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Our adoption will result in balance sheet reclassifications for recording our estimate for customer returns. Historically, our deferred revenue liability for customer returns has not been material. ASU 2014-09 requires the recognition of a current liability for the gross amount of the estimated returns and a current asset for the cost of the related products (each less than $1.0 million at December 31, 2017). We will also provide enhanced disclosures regarding our revenue recognition policies    ��

&#x200B;

To me, the company is introducing a subtle change going forward which will allow them to recognize revenue just by presenting the product to the third party carriers- which is certainly aggressive in my opinion.

t3_9ipl0b,Diamond Hill Capital (DHIL) Thesis and Valuation Draft,"Hello. I’m looking for some guidance on my investment thesis and valuation of Diamond Hill Capital.

**Overview**

Diamond Hill (NASDAQ: DHIL) is a Columbus, Ohio-based asset manager with $22 billion AUM as of September 5th, 2018. They have a market cap of around 570M and are currently trading at $162.70, down 20% YTD. The equity is trading at a 4.9x EV/EBIT multiple and a 10x P/E multiple. 

The firm is an investment advisor employing a research team of 48 individuals that publicly manage 11 public equity funds, 4 public fixed income funds, and 2 private hedge funds. Their CEO since 2000, Ric Dillon, stepped down at the end of 2017 in a planned exit from the firm. Their most recent fund was the Diamond Hill Global Fund, which was introduced at the end of 2017. Most of the AUM is invested into their Large Cap strategy, with 11.56B dedicated to that particular function. Their second greatest weight is in their Long-Short strategy, at 4.30B. 

Though they sit at the oft-maligned intersection of active management and value investing, the great majority of their funds have managed to outperform their respective benchmarks on a lifetime basis, although recent performance has been comparatively poor. This has not prevented their total AUM from growing. From 2007 to 2017, their total ending AUM CAGR has been 12.11%. 

The firm has annually distributed a special dividend for the past 10 years, returning a nominal amount of $211M back to shareholders. Buybacks are rarely implemented—the last was in 2011. 

**Safety**

The business is very capital light and generates high free cash flow. 

Management is diversifying their holdings, explaining the launch of a global equity fund. Along similar lines, the fixed income portfolios are doing well, possibly prompting more marketing efforts in that area.

Employees have their interests aligned with the firm. Compensation is tied to performance after 5 years and involve options as well as cash incentives. 

**Risks**

The investment portfolio of $205M is subject to market volatility.

Market downturn would affect their cash flow generation as well as their investment portfolio.

Key personnel may leave, leading to poor performance, leading to more departures.

Secular headwinds in the asset management industry as a whole.

**Valuation**

DCF File: https://www.dropbox.com/s/55jfby7zbcrzanb/DHIL_Financials.xlsx?dl=0

Given a general lack of guidance in valuing an asset manager, I tried to fit the firm’s operations into a more traditional DCF valuation. Given that my numbers are indicating a 37% upside with a terminal FCF growth rate of -6.6%, my valuation is deeply flawed. 

My projections tied revenues to a percentage of total ending AUM, as this relationship has remained fairly consistent, hovering around .60%. Compensation and Sales and Marketing expenses were both tied to revenue, while G&A and Mutual Fund Administration expenses were tied to AUM. I looked at the covariance in those relationships and aimed to project the relationships that fluctuated the least for each.

* *Base Case Assumptions*

My base case assumes 1% CAGR in Ending AUM for the next 10 years. 

Investment advisory fees decline from .60% to .58% over the next 10 years. 

* *Upside Case Assumptions*

1% growth in ending AUM in year 1.

The following numbers come from the 2017 PwC report on Asset Management, specifically the North American AUM growth projections. 

5.7% growth in years 2 and 3. 

4% growth til year 8 and 2% growth after. 

Fees stabilize at .60% over the next 10 years.

* *Downside Case Assumptions*

1% growth in year 1. 25% decline in AUM year 2. 2% growth til year 10.

Fees decline from .60% to .51% over 10 years. 

**Peer Comparisons**

There were constraints on the peer group: these were some of the only companies that I could find the forward earnings projections for. I chose Manning and Napier (MN), Pzena Investment Management (PZN), Virtus Investment Partners (VRTS), and Victory Capital Holdings (VCTR) for the peer comparisons. They have AUM ranging from 23B to 63B, which I thought was a decent range, and market cap ranging from 600M to 1B with the exception of Manning, which has a market cap of 40M due to the common stock only having a 17.8% claim on the actual investing business. 
I looked at the companies primarily through EV/EBIT multiples. The median LTM multiple was 8.6x, but the projections saw a decrease after two years to 7.6x. On the other hand, DHIL’s LTM EV/EBIT multiple was 4.9x, decreasing to 4.8x over the same period. 

**Conclusion**

Given their ability to attract capital inflows, Diamond Hill’s low multiple seems unjustified. While the numbers on the DCF do not seem trustworthy by any means, I think they definitely are pointing in the right direction. 

**Next Steps**

I am unsure what quantitative or qualitative factors I should take a deeper look at. I am comfortable reaching out to IR but am looking for feedback on where to go with my analysis. General advice on how to form an investment thesis would be appreciated, as well as ideas on how to troubleshoot a DCF.

Some discuss the macro trends and some are more about the companies adding or detracting from the portfolio results.  I am trying to find ways to aggregate the content into something higher level that can given a sense of whats going on.. Perhaps even why a company that is in favor at one fund would be out of favor at another. Love to hear about how people leverage these letters to make investment decisions.,7,0.77,1538063389.0
t3_9jiyco,Red Flags That Signal Fraud,"Has anyone here actively looked for potentially fraudulent companies? What are red flags you look for when you are screening? I feel like there are usually signals or 'cockaroaches' that flag companies that may not be properly valued by the market. Examples I've found useful are rising DSOs, growing gap between EPS and FCF, management turnover, material weakness' in controls over financial reporting, cookie jar reserves and non-GAAP sales adjustments to name a few. Anyone else got any signals they look for??

t3_9jzupj,"What technique do you think Buffett used ""which gives promise of very substantially reducing the risk from an overall change in valuation standards""? (from 1964 partnership letter)","I'm reading through Buffett's partnership letters, he usually has 3 categories of investments: Generals, Workouts, and Controls. In 1964, he split the Generals category into two: Generals - Private Owner Basis, and Generals - Relatively Undervalued.

&#x200B;

Here is the excerpt about the new category:

>""Generals -Relatively Undervalued"" - this category consists of securities selling at prices relatively cheap compared to securities of the same general quality. We demand substantial discrepancies from current valuation standards, but (usually because of large size) do not feel value to a private owner to be a meaningful concept. It is important in this category, of course, that apples be compared to apples - and not to oranges, and we work hard at achieving that end. In the great majority of cases we simply do not know enough about the industry or company to come to sensible judgments -in that situation we pass.   
>  
>As mentioned earlier, this new category has been growing and has produced very satisfactory results. **We have recently begun to implement a technique, which gives promise of very substantially reducing the risk from an overall change in valuation standards; e.g. I we buy something at 12 times earnings when comparable or poorer quality companies sell at 20 times earnings, but then a major revaluation takes place so the latter only sell at 10 times.**   
>  
>This risk has always bothered us enormously because of the helpless position in which we could be left compared to the ""Generals -Private Owner"" or ""Workouts"" types. With this risk diminished, we think this category has a promising future.""

Is there anything known about what technique Buffett is referring to? Is he talking about a hedge of sorts, or some analytical method to avoid an upcoming devaluation of the equities of other companies in a given sector.

t3_9lwfg2,Journey Energy (TSE:JOY),"Hi there, was just hoping for some feedback on my report on Journey Energy Inc. (TSE: JOY)

It appears to be a ""mis-priced security"" with an upcoming catalyst, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Thank you!

&#x200B;

**Journey Energy (TSE: JOY) September 28, 2018**

Journey Energy (TSE: JOY) is a Canadian junior oil and gas producer that provides a wide margin of safety (i.e. paying 50 cents for a dollar) between its current share price and its intrinsic or, net asset value per share. This disconnect is due to the 2014 oil price collapse and continued disinterest by investors in the Canadian energy sector. The expiration of Journey’s 2018 hedging program will nearly double cash flow, and likely provide a catalyst for an upward valuation in its share price to reflect this underlying value.

In addition, Journey’s land holdings (\~150,000 hectares) are located in central Alberta are producing \~10,000 bbls (49% liquids) per day (\~16% decline), and contain ownership rights in the prospective Duvernay formation adding a speculative possibility for further increase in share value.

**Net Asset Value and Catalyst**

Journey IPO’d in June of 2014, trading at \~$12 per share. Since that time, the share price has steadily decreased to a low of \~$1 (December of 2015) as oil prices collapsed in late 2014. In 2016, Journey was forced to cancel its dividend program in order to protect its balance sheet further disappointing investors.

In the last two years, the company has survived the Canadian oil and gas downturn and has managed to avoid bankruptcy. However, the stock price has not recovered and at the time of writing, is currently trading around $2.00 per share. This has created an opportunity to invest in a company that is being ignored by the market and is trading at a discount to net asset value.

Proven Developed Producing (PDP) Reserves are the closest thing an oil company has to tangible ‘inventory’ and contain a 90% chance of recovery. PDP reserves are outlined by producing wells and are the most accurate measurement of an oil company’s ‘inventory’. Subtracting company debt from this PDP value gives a close approximation of net asset value (assets - liabilities).

While other factors can be added into calculating the net asset value per share such as land, and more speculative reserve estimates, PDP (less debt) offers the most reliable measurement of what value or ‘price’ one should receive for selling the business today.

The market Is currently discounting Journey when compared to its industry peers (see corporate slide below) on this PDP or net asset value per share basis. With oil prices stabilizing (and perhaps rising further), it is only a matter of time before the current gap between net asset value per share (\~$3.40) and the market price (\~$2.00) per share starts to narrow. This is especially true as Journey’s 2018 hedging program is set to expire.

(SLIDE 19)

[https://www.journeyenergy.ca/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-Corporate-Presentation-Sep-2018.pdf](https://www.journeyenergy.ca/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-Corporate-Presentation-Sep-2018.pdf)

The expiration of the hedging plan will nearly double current cash flow from \~$27 (MM) to $44 MM (see slide below) and with \~38.5 MM shares outstanding, will take cash flow per share from \~$0.70 to \~$1.13. The end result will be a catalyst for an upwards valuation in the market. The previous hedging program was set in place to protect Journey during a period of lower oil prices ($30-50 per barrel), but is no longer needed as reflected in the 2019 hedging program. 2019’s program has \~80% of its oil production hedged at $70-80 barrel CDN.

(SLIDE 14)

[https://www.journeyenergy.ca/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-Corporate-Presentation-Sep-2018.pdf](https://www.journeyenergy.ca/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-Corporate-Presentation-Sep-2018.pdf)

While Journey carries a significant amount of debt (\~$120MM), a majority of its equity base is institutionally owned. AIMCO for example, owns 17% of Journey’s outstanding shares. As long as the company is able to maintain current debt levels (which should be attainable given improving oil prices), Journey’s real value lies not so much in the company’s future (albeit speculative) plans and expectations, but more simply as a “mark to market” valuation of its shares.

With expiring hedges nearly doubling cash flow, and a discounted share price (compared to market peers), investors are presented with a margin of safety allowing for a capital gain of roughly 40-50% to reflect net asset value per share.

Journey is led by Alex Verge (former CEO of NuVista) who was brought in by a pension fund and is supported by an experienced management team in engineering and geology. But again, the risk-adjusted opportunity to investors exists not so much in optimistic plans for the company, but rather in a rational market correction of its current share price.

Furthermore, Journey bought back approximately 20% of its stock this year with Mr. Verge and other executives participating. All told, Journey has inside ownership of \~15%. This gives investors even more assurance as to management’s confidence in the company’s long-term prospects.

**Duvernay**

Along with undervalued PDP reserves and increased cash flow, Journey sits on a quality Duvernay land position. While not all Duvernay acreage is created equal, and means close to nothing until drilled/proved, there are some large names in the area (Baytex Energy, Crescent Point) that have been buying acreage up at fairly sizeable rates ($400-$1000 hectare).

[https://www.journeyenergy.ca/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-Corporate-Presentation-Sep-2018.pdf](https://www.journeyenergy.ca/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-Corporate-Presentation-Sep-2018.pdf)

The company also recently entered into a Joint Venture deal with Pat Carlson (former CEO & Founder of Seven Generations Energy) to explore and develop these Duvernay lands. This arrangement should help Journey understand what possibilities exist in the area and potentially increase the value of its land holdings.

If the Duvernay hype does turn out to be profitable, Journey may turn out to be a sensible acquisition candidate for larger companies in the area such as Baytex or Crescent Point. This is very speculative, but at the very least could add a cherry to the cake in the form of increased oil production.

**Summary**

Duvernay land holdings aside, the main argument for Journey is that an out of favor Canadian energy market is currently undervaluing the company on a net asset value per share basis compared to its peers. An upwards evaluation should be aided by a near doubling of cash flow in 2019 as its current hedging program expires at the end of 2018. This undervalued position presents a significant margin of safety without consideration for future plans of the company.

**Margin of Safety (50 cents on the dollar)**

Market Value: \~$85-90MM Enterprise Value: \~$200MM

PDP 10 Reserve Value: $251 MM Debt: \~$120MM

Current share price: \~$2.30

Net Asset Value = PDP 10 Reserve Value – Debt= $251 MM - $120 MM= $131 MM

Net Asset Value: \~$130MM / \~38.5MM(shares outstanding)

**NAV Per Share (Target Price) = \~$3.40 which at minimum, provides \~40-50% return to investors 2) Catalyst**

Higher oil prices combined with an old hedging program set to expire at the end of 2018 which will almost double cash flow. This combined with a market realization that the PDP reserve value and net asset value are below market value (on a per share basis).

**3) Duvernay Land Holding**

Entered into large JV with Pat Carlson for its Duvernay rights which doesn’t mean much at this point but could provide value in future in the form of proprietary drilling information, increased oil production, or the chance being acquired by a larger company.",4,0.65,1538836897.0

t3_9ov2hx,Are bond ETFs doomed in a rising interest rate environment?,"This is just a thought experiment for me, as I have no exposure to these products. But bear with me:

- Most bond ETFs target a particular duration
- Over time, the manager would be forced to sell bonds with a shorter duration than the target, and buy new bonds with a longer duration than the target
- If interest rates are rising, this means buying new and highly interest rate sensitive bonds at par, and selling older bonds at presumably well below par
- Even if the manager held the bonds to maturity, the ETF’s price would continuously be marking the bond portfolio to market, so you wouldn’t be able to just collect your principal at maturity like you could if you owned bonds outright. The portfolio would be continuously trading down anyways

I’m by no means a professional fixed income investor and happy to hear if I’m overlooking something. But I just can’t see how these products can perform in a secular bear market for bonds? It seems like no matter what, the ETF’s principal value will erode. It’s not the same for outright bond ownership, where at least your principal is protected if you hold to maturity.

Question for the community - how do you think about great companies in very competitive industries. Lets take the airline industry. On the surface of it, very tough. Subject to oil prices, regulations, stiff competition, capital intensive, demand can vary sharply depending on where you are in the economic cycle, and not to mention lots of random forces like weather/plane crashes.  That said, there are some very well run companies within the industry. For example, Southwest. Some 39 years of profit, excellent return of capital, good business strategy.

Would you avoid the industry all together? Would you try to find deep value here to take advantage of some sort of revision to the mean? Or stick to the best run companies? Also curious if anyone has data/analogies from other sectors/industries.

**Vistra Energy Corp (VST) – $22.45 on Oct. 23, 2018**

A recently spun-off entity of Energy Future Holdings, the largest LBO and bankruptcy in history, VST is an integrated power producer with the lowest cost of operations in the nation, lowest levered company in the industry, and either the #1 or #2 player in the retail and wholesale power market in Texas. 

When the company IPO’d in 2016, a majority of its stock was owned by its creditors coming out of the bankruptcy. (Brookfield, Apollo, and Oaktree) Management has stated in earnings calls that the creditors are urging the company to diversify its shareholder base so that the creditors can rotate out their stock. Despite the creditors trying to rotate \~7B in stock, the stock has doubled since 2016.

Management has tried their best to attract new investors whom they might have lost from the bankruptcy. VST returned 1B in capital to shareholders in 2016 and the board has approved 500m in buybacks for 2018. Management has hinted at a recurring growing dividend starting at 3-4% coming soon.

With the recent merger with Dynegy (all stock with value of around $1.7B or 60,000/MW of capacity, majority CCGT plants, compared to 895,000/MW to build a new CCGT plant), the company has $10.387B in debt. VST plans on paying off $3.6B of debt by YE2019 with its free cash flow to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5x. The company hopes to achieve investment grade status to lower its cost of debt, attract more institutional investors, and lower its cost to hedge.

The clarity in VST’s earnings and cash flow come from their ability to hedge natural gas prices and heat rates well before they are required to deliver. Having one of the lowest cost of operations in industry provides ample margin of safety, as well as having the retail business. One of the great things about the integrated power model is that one is not coupled to either the wholesale or the retail market’s prices. If retail customers see their cost of electricity increase, they will flock to the wholesale markets, and vice versa. Because VST is the biggest player in both, they see stable earnings regardless of price fluctuations.

In addition, VST has the advantage in the retail markets due to its size and integrated model. Because retail customers hate seeing their power prices increase, especially in the summer during peak demand, VST is able to smooth out prices for their retail customers. Other retail players in the market cannot do this because they are too small and do not have the capital or extra capacity required. It is not unreasonable to expect VST’s retail business to grow in the future. 

A quick summary of management, the CEO has 35 years experience in all of the power markets. He emphasizes VST’s rigorous investment discipline of a hurdle rate 600 basis points above cost of capital and commitment to being the lowest cost and leveraged operator.

**What’s the upside?**

The company is currently valued according to management’s guidance for 2018-2019, with EBITDA growing at 1% thereafter. There is a lot of room for potential actions that will be accretive to the stock , such as buybacks or acquisitions, that are not priced in. With 1B in 2019 and 6B in 2022 of cash available for allocation, the probability of something good happening is fairly high.

**What’s the downside?**

The plants are valued at 20% of overnight capital cost, or the cost of a new plant if it were to appear overnight. Guidance is close to certain, as the company hedges out earnings 2 years ahead.

Management expects the markets to tighten as there are not many new CCGT plants being planned for the next 2-3 years. That means that power prices should increase in the next few years during peak demand.

The newbuild of wind in ERCOT is unlikely to effect VST because wind is not generated during peak demand hours. For wind to be competitive with VST’s CCGT plants, batteries must also be installed along side the renewables, yet there is no forecast for future battery storage in ERCOT.

Solar is still a non-player in Texas, and wind is starting to reach its potential in the best locations for generation. 

Other risks include plant outages, management going against their word to accrue large amount of debt, and regulatory risk.

**Why does this opportunity exist?**

With a daily volume of 5 - 6 million shares, I believe the shareholder base is diversifying and the creditors are selling. This is why the price wiggles around 23. Management still needs to earn investors’ trust back after the bankruptcy, so it will take some time and results to see sentiment around VST change. There are also biases against VST with the current atmosphere around renewables and clean energy. The utilities industry is also not known for high growth and may still have a bad taste in investors’ mouths.

t3_9vcgla,The Fun of Investing - Do you ever feel like you're wasting your time?,"Do you ever feel like you've wasted your time and energy after hours of thorough analysis that concludes with discarding your initial thesis? 

&#x200B;

Let me point out that I'm new to the markets and security analysis. I'm not employed in the financial industry, nor am I looking to be. I spend around 15-20 hours per week on investing my personal funds, doing analyses and educating myself on the topic. I have an investment and screening process, although maybe not sophisticated enough, I'm not just analyzing random companies.  

&#x200B;

Since I'm not actually getting paid for my analyses, I sometimes feel like I'm wasting my time spending several hours on digging into 10-K's and -Q's, investor presentations and industry reports, only to conclude that the security at hand is not worth an investment in the vast majority of cases.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the process of analysing and investing by itself for the most part, otherwise I wouldn't be doing it, but at times it feels like I'm doing a lot of work for nothing.

t3_9y9gng,Thoughts on American Axle & Manufacturing (NYSE:AXL),"Hey, I wrote my thoughts down on AAM after its Q3 earnings, let me know where I can improve, thoughts on what I wrote, or anything I got wrong/missed.  

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 

American Axle & Manufacturing (NYSE: AXL) is an OEM parts distributor for auto companies across the United States.  They currently supply parts for General Motors (GM), Jaguar, Nissan, and are OEMs for various other supply companies.  Due to the nature of automotive manufacturing, it is important to note that this company is a long-term hold.  In the automotive industry, it is common for the time between shipment and receiving money to be longer than 6 months.  As a result, companies can have a large accounts receivable at any given time.  With that in mind, let’s dive into why AXL will be a good hold.

1. Book price per share of $16.445

First thing off the bat is a book per share higher than the stock price as of writing (currently at $11.66).  Normally, book per share is the minimum a company should be valued at, by calculating its assets and subtracting the liabilities.  This, divided by outstanding shares, is the value of all assets the company holds.  This means that if the company sold all its assets to pay to its investors, each investor would receive the book per share price.  As such, the price should eventually rise to this price, as it has been hovering around that price for a while.

2.   Decreased dependence on General Motors

Normally, a company that supplies only to one company will move in step with the company it is supplying for.  And for a while, GM was 66% of AXL’s business.  This means that if GM were to move on, they would lose the lion’s share of its revenues.  While unlikely, this move would completely shut down the company.  However, in 2017, GM only accounted for 47% of AXL’s revenue, a 19% decrease.  This was not due to GM; rather, it was due to AXL’s acquirement of MPG, another OEM like AXL.  This move will help them in the long run by diversifying its customer base, allowing it both more market share as well as hedges against uncertainty in the supply chain.

3.  Position as OEM to big brands creates a high wall of entry for competitors

AXL’s nature as an OEM helps them greatly in retaining customers.  Generally, when an automotive company picks an OEM, it becomes difficult to switch up partners, simply due to how intensive the production of these cars is.  Unlike markets such as electronics, there aren’t as many producers of specific parts for cars due to the cost of it.  So picking an OEM is basically a proposal for most companies.  This shows with AXL’s track record, winning GM’s 2016 Supplier of the Year award and maintaining the lion’s share of GM’s business.  With their acquisition of MPG bringing them new large customers, AXL has a clear path for additional revenue in the future.

4.  The company’s own people are buying it

When the company’s own people sip their Kool-Aid, the company is either drunk of their own power, or they believe that they still have a solid company.  With AXL, I believe it is the latter.  Due to lackluster Q3 results, the stock dropped from its ranging $15-17 dollar range to around $11 dollars.  Despite this setback, many of the company’s leaders bought shares after the dip, including the CEO purchasing a million dollars worth of stock.  The company and its people believe in the long-term growth of the company, and they are more incentivized now to produce as well as they have been for the last few years.

5.  Sales for end of 2018 are looking on track

The third quarter for AXL is looking to shape up to how it was for Q4 of 2017.  Their driveline segment is on par for last year, with roughly 3.2 billion dollars in sales so far, only 800 million short of Q4 last year.  Meanwhile, its metal forming unit has produced sales by Q3 this year that almost outstrip Q4 for AXL last year(1.176b vs 1.242).  Its other segments, powertrain, and casting, have both beaten Q4 results from last year already.  This shows that the diversification of AXL is paying off already, increasing sales in multiple segments for the company.

Sophisticated investors know that hedge funds aim to provide good risk-adjusted returns and may not necessarily aim to beat the market or popular market benchmarks like the S&P 500, so the comparisons that are made between hedge funds returns and market returns are somewhat misleading.

t3_9zylyp,Learning about valuation and wanting to cross-check my current understanding,"New investor here and as the title suggest, I would like to cross-check some of the knowledge I recently acquired to identify gaps as I move forward learning about security analysis.

My understanding is that when it comes to valuation there are 2 main approaches: Intrinsic and Relative valuation.

**Intrinsic Valuation**

The value of the asset is estimated by its cash flow, growth and risk. The EIL5 version is that the asset value is relative to how well we project the company will do in the future. This requires a few assumptions like ROE, Growth Rate and FCF. DCF is the common approach to find a stock's intrinsic value to which there are many variations: DDM, FCFE and FCFF.

**Relative Valuation**

The value of the asset is estimated relative to its peers group market value. The EIL5 version would be to compare it to paying for a house. One would pay for a house after scouting what the next door houses sell for and adjust price expectations accordingly. The same applies for stocks.

To do relative valuation we need a standardized price to be used to compare assets since the market value of the stock is in some ways a function of the number of outstanding shares. So to normalize the price for comparison, it is divided by some value that directly relates to the company valuation such as earnings for example (i.e: a multiple). The reason to use company valuation is because relative valuation assumes that assets within the same peer group shares similar cash flows, growth and risks.

Some examples of relative valuations are: P/E, P/B, EV/EBIT etc. Those can be used to compare assets directly within the same peer group or compare the multiple of the asset against the multiple of the entire peer group average.

That being said, since not every company is made equal such a company can have a higher growth than the average expected growth of its peer, we need another multiple to account for growth differences which otherwise would make companies with unusual high growth have high price to earnings compared to the average. One way to do this is the PEG ratio which is basically taking the PE divided by the expected growth. The ELI5 version is that such as we normalize the market value relative to valuation criteria, we account for growth difference by normalizing the multiples to the growth to have an adjusted metric for comparison across a set of assets.

t3_a10c88,Great company at fair price vs. bad company at discount,"In other words:

Warren Buffet: ""I'd rather buy a great business at a reasonable price than a reasonable business at a great price.""

vs.

Howard Marks: ""It's not what you buy, it's the price you pay that makes a good investment.""

&#x200B;

Although these notions aren't mutually exclusive, it makes me wonder, if it's better to focus on price or quality for high returns.

&#x200B;

I'm usually looking for undervalued securities that trade at a discount to their intrinsic value, particularly in small caps and spin-offs. However, recently I've been spending more time thinking about the qualitiy of businesses, esecially in terms of the qualitative factors that promote and sustain high levels of ROIC and growth - the key metrics driving high cash flow generation and shareholder returns.

&#x200B;

Could you possibly be better off investing in a handful of amazing companies at a fair price and prticipate in their long term value generation? Or is it maybe that both approaches can yield equally high returns depending on the specific strengths of the investor? Maybe one is better at assassing businesses competitive advantage and their long term prospects and the others strength lies in finding inefficiencies and undiscovered value.",25,0.94,1543361284.0

&#x200B;

The arguments about disruption, the glasses, Apple's reliance on increasing their prices - these things don't bother me.

&#x200B;

There are two issues that are troubling me though  


The first is Apple's $66 billion in corporate bonds. But that is for another day...  


The second is Apple's reliance on China for low-cost labour.   


The trade war with the US means that Apple are going to make changes to their supply chain and reduce their reliance on China. Manufacturers are also investing heavily in automation. Foxconn is investing $4 billion in automation via robotics and is also ""bringing manufacturing back"" to the US through smart factories. Obviously, this will reduce reliance on Chinese labour and this is happening already:  


[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36376966](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36376966)  


I have yet to go through other  Chinese suppliers, however I imagine they are doing something similar.

  
My question:

Even if these suppliers reduce their reliance on Chinese workers via automation...  would Apple still need workers in China to assemble the iPhone?  Can iPhone assembly itself be automated?

&#x200B;

I didn't mention Apple's reliance on China for actual revenue - I'm skeptical of that too. I don't buy the idea that China is on the verge of world domination, I think its more likely to be a credit Ponzi Scheme as per Crescat Capital's research.

t3_a0tz7a,Assets Under Management vs Market Cap of invested companies.,"I have a few disparate thoughts on the subject that I'd like to throw out, which lead me to believe that the appropriate approach to early investment success is to focus on investments whose valuations are in the ballpark of your assets under management, roughly. 
So if your managing less than $1m, it might make sense to focus on companies valued below $50m. 

Some thoughts:
Warren Buffett has said over and again that if he had less money to manage he would focus only on small companies. 
Successful investors tend to rise to the top rapidly, with more assets under management, investing in micro caps does not move the needle. 
Likewise, companies that provide research focus on clients that pay the most, clients that make the most money are looking at earning billions, not hundreds of thousands of dollars, so again you are in a less charted territory. 
The only investor whose name I see in the smallest of microcaps (sub $1m even) is Jim Simons. Obviously Jim's hedge fund is pure programmatic trading, and so it makes sense that the marginal effort for his computers to buy micro caps outweighs the cost. 
Small investors have less experience, and often these micro caps are the easiest to understand and analyze the value on the private market. 
Its hard to know what will drive a price correction in an undervalued small security, the general advice of buying a basket of them, continously buying them if they go down, be willing to hold for several years, and if possible, owning a significant enough portion of the company to influence management, are apparently some of the keys to succeeding in this environment.

t3_a1iuh4,Increase in inventory following a rights issue (non-distressed company),"I'm looking at this rather smallish manufacturing company. There was a rights issue in Sept 2017. Basically, their inventories hovered around the $30mil region for the past few years leading to the rights issue. Their quarterly revenue was also around the $30mil region.

Now, one of the reasons for the rights issue was for cash to be used to purchase additional raw materials etc. For the quarter ending Dec 2017, the inventories were still normal at $30mil (the injection from the rights issue would have come in somewhere in Oct 2017). By Mar 2018, this was at $44mil, and by June 2018 it was at $59mil. For the quarter ended Sept 2018, the inventory stood at $60mil. 

Thing is, amid all this, revenue hasn't really grown. Heck, in the quarter ended Mar 2018, revenue dipped. But since then it has picked up to the same level as last year.

t3_a2cs95,Buffett and EBITDA: Chairman's Letter-1989,"As a copy-paste from his 1989 shareholder's letter:  


&#x200B;

""But as happens in Wall Street all too often, what the wise 

do in the beginning, fools do in the end. In the last few years 

zero-coupon bonds (and their functional equivalent, pay-in-kind 

bonds, which distribute additional PIK bonds semi-annually as 

interest instead of paying cash) have been issued in enormous 

quantities by ever-junkier credits. To these issuers, zero (or 

PIK) bonds offer one overwhelming advantage:  It is impossible to 

default on a promise to pay nothing. Indeed, if LDC governments 

had issued no debt in the 1970's other than long-term zero-coupon 

obligations, they would now have a spotless record as debtors.

&#x200B;

This principle at work - that you need not default for a 

long time if you solemnly promise to pay nothing for a long time 

\- has not been lost on promoters and investment bankers seeking 

to finance ever-shakier deals. But its acceptance by lenders took 

a while: When the leveraged buy-out craze began some years back, 

purchasers could borrow only on a reasonably sound basis, in 

which conservatively-estimated free cash flow - that is, 

operating earnings plus depreciation and amortization less 

normalized capital expenditures - was adequate to cover both 

interest and modest reductions in debt.

&#x200B;

Later, as the adrenalin of deal-makers surged, businesses 

began to be purchased at prices so high that all free cash flow 

necessarily had to be allocated to the payment of interest. That 

left nothing for the paydown of debt. In effect, a Scarlett 

O'Hara ""I'll think about it tomorrow"" position in respect to 

principal payments was taken by borrowers and accepted by a new 

breed of lender, the buyer of original-issue junk bonds. Debt now 

became something to be refinanced rather than repaid. The change 

brings to mind a New Yorker cartoon in which the grateful 

borrower rises to shake the hand of the bank's lending officer 

and gushes: ""I don't know how I'll ever repay you.""

&#x200B;

Soon borrowers found even the new, lax standards intolerably 

binding. To induce lenders to finance even sillier transactions, 

they introduced an abomination, EBDIT - Earnings Before 

Depreciation, Interest and Taxes - as the test of a company's 

ability to pay interest. Using this sawed-off yardstick, the 

borrower ignored depreciation as an expense on the theory that it 

did not require a current cash outlay. 

&#x200B;

Such an attitude is clearly delusional. At 95% of American 

businesses, capital expenditures that over time roughly 

approximate depreciation are a necessity and are every bit as 

real an expense as labor or utility costs. Even a high school 

dropout knows that to finance a car he must have income that 

covers not only interest and operating expenses, but also 

realistically-calculated depreciation. He would be laughed out of 

the bank if he started talking about EBDIT. 

&#x200B;

Capital outlays at a business can be skipped, of course, in 

any given month, just as a human can skip a day or even a week of 

eating. But if the skipping becomes routine and is not made up, 

the body weakens and eventually dies. Furthermore, a start-and-

stop feeding policy will over time produce a less healthy 

organism, human or corporate, than that produced by a steady 

diet. As businessmen, Charlie and I relish having competitors who 

are unable to fund capital expenditures.

...

 The blue ribbon for mischief-making should go to the zero-

coupon issuer unable to make its interest payments on a current 

basis. Our advice: Whenever an investment banker starts talking 

about EBDIT - or whenever someone creates a capital structure

Maybe I'm naive and just don't understand the role of EBITDA based measures when it comes to analyzing cash flow. He gives his conservatively-stated FCF formula, he never said he didn't account for cash flow, but he didn't (at least back then) concern himself with new measures that allow you to get away with so much accounting and financial mess. If his point stands to scrutiny and those sorts of features erase depreciation and amortization as measures to account for when investing in a business, then why are EBITDA based measures so prominent? Why does your ability to just pay interest (which I imagine is the equivalent of you paying for the frosting on someone else's cake) matter when the debt itself isn't being extinguished?",25,0.81,1543753126.0

In this particular case, JD for me is a long-term play as in I expected it to be a 5x in the next 5 years, but clearly things are going as planned.  When do we draw the line and say this stock was never worth $40+?

t3_a3ftr7,A case for pro-active management,"* As we approach the end of the economic expansion, thoughtful risk-management is quite important, is your investment portfolio best positioned to withstand a bear market drawdown?
* During the last 10 years the narrative has strongly favored passive, index following investment as excess liquidity from central bank drove interest rates to historical lows giving multiple shoots of adrenaline to risk-assets. We have seen one of the strongest performances in equities and bonds in the last several decades.
* Investors have gotten comfortable with multi-year double digit returns driven in part by strong growth and high valuations in technology coupled with financial engineering — share-buybacks funded with cheap debt financing.
* The near 3X increase in the S&P500 has increased the prominence of Exchange Traded Funds (vehicles that give you exposure to different segments of the market) growing to nearly $6 trillion and the popularity of robo-advisors (computer driven portfolio optimization) now managing over 225 billion.
* It appears most investors have gotten comfortable during many years of historically low market volatility and strong returns. Memories of economic cycles and large market corrections are somewhat lost with time while newer generation of investors have not experienced this in their adult lifetimes.
* The passive vs. active debate is a heated one. The passive investment has multiple merits for the non-professional investor like low cost, little to no time commitment but it also give caps your returns with those of the overall market and exposes to inevitable material losses. The timing and length of these wealth drawdowns can be punitive for clients counting of capital accumulation for an important financial decision like a large purchase, investment, or retirement.
* As the economy slows, fiscal and monetary stimulus phases out, and new political players come into place escalating geo-political risks, cross-asset class performance synchronize with little to no place to hide. This causes risk-appetite to wane impact asset returns driven by the economic cycle and investor psychology — growth, credit and easy money is inherently cyclical and does not last forever. This is when pro-active risk management, thoughtful security and sector allocation begins to shine, right before the strong tide of positive returns goes out. 
* Turbulent times offer great opportunities for those who commit full time to the challenge of hard work studying the macro (top-down) and micro (bottom-up) environment to act decisively when the time is right.
* Irrespective of active vs. passive, we believe that everyone should have access to the best investment strategies that only affluent investors can afford. 
* We are doing meaningful work for clients to compound wealth and achieve long term financial goals through our managed account investment management solution launched in September, 2018. We are grateful to have the trust of anchor investors with their initial capital commitments.
* We use our prior experience in pro-active risk and portfolio management to limit downside risk during difficult times and position the portfolio to benefit from attractive asymmetric opportunities across bonds, equities, and derivatives.
* We are off to a great start with encouraging results during the first three months despite strong market volatility. 
* We look forward to sharing, in a transparent and open manner, our approach to investment management, progress to date, and forward looking views on strategy over the coming weeks.",2,0.67,1544039310.0

Feel free to comment/discuss pros and cons of this.

The question was asked by my friend and reasoning is my thought process.

&#x200B;

\>How often is an inversion a clear indicator of recession?

&#x200B;

**In theory, it should create recession 100%.** The simple reason/justification how it works:

&#x200B;

Normally, banks find a borrower, lend them ARM, fixed or commercial term loans normally ranges 3 to 30 years.

During this process, bank as a service provider, borrows from underwriters and lend it to borrower.

Or

Borrow from another bank (Temporary) - inter bank transaction (FED fund rate) - and lend it to borrower.

&#x200B;

When short term rates (3-month) are higher than long term rates, they can not find any underwriter for longer term loans, neither profitable to borrow from another bank using inter bank transaction.

&#x200B;

**When someone is able to get 4% return on 3 months low risk loan, why would someone lend for 10 year 3.75% return?**

&#x200B;

When this situation prevails for six months, The banking lending operations reduced or stand still for six months, companies won’t get financing, people won’t get financing.

&#x200B;

Since our US economy runs in credit based, most of the purchasing power is diminished, resulting revenue and profit reduction (or loss) for companies…etc

* You pay a lower multiple of 10.7x relative to the 15.3x on the SP for higher growth rate next year of 9.2% in EPS and 7.2% in revenues — note these multiples are lower than the lows of Feb 2016
* You can arbitrage shorting 10yr treasury @ 2.9% (now that short squeeze have been cleared out) / long the regional banks for a total cost of \~15bps
* The 10 year yield will come under pressure as fiscal deficit increases (1.2 trillion in 2019 plus fed shrinking balance sheet by 500-600bn a year); crowing out effects from fiscal spending, Chineses no longer buying as much treasury
* Obvious concerns / risks here are the flattening yield curve, and slowing decelerating economy from 3.5% to 2.5% in '19 but public companies earnings are still projected to increase by 8%, loan books should expand accordingly with increasing profits while rates remain very low and attractive to corporates to underwrite projects with very low cost of capital
* Potential pockets of upside for the sector are: high yield issuance, which has been slow in recent quarters, spreads have expanded somewhat this quarter; residential housing decelerating but sector is overall healthy and prices still increasing; mortgage rates are trending up nicely, a positive for banks; lending standards are still somewhat tight with room for lending without meaningfully hurting underwriting standards

t3_a45t0r,Underwriting risky bets,"During fundraising a common discussion topics has been how do you think about underwriting risk? A fair question indeed, there are many ways to think about managing risk in a portfolio but we tend to follow a simply probabilistic framework, see table below. We aim to prioritize positions in terms of reward / risk proposition. The higher the payoff per investment relative to a max defined loss the greater the probability weighted attribution to annual portfolio, the higher the likelihood we would hit our annual return target. Finding opportunities that meet this minimum payoff profile is hard so when we do finding them we want to bet with conviction. In our view it is better to invest with conviction than follow a lottery approach. The small frequent and small betting approach is harder because even if you are right, small positions don’t move the overall portfolio return needle. To partially mitigate synchronization we aim to beat of areas with little cross-correlation. Ultimately the bulk of the returns will come from a few good ideas with outsized returns so avoiding large losers that eat into the cumulative year to date returns is by far the best wining strategy. An additional challenge is to manage timing, given we could be right at the wrong time which in investment manage is not different than being totally wrong. Given a probability of success, we will manage our an accumulation strategy over time to avoid hitting our max loss too soon. We do this by ensuring we get the widest margin of safety using conservative valuation assumptions, measuring sentiment and capping realized losses using derivatives when the cost is reasonable.

Trying to do some basic analysis of a merger situation.  Steps are:

* (1) *Run through the evaluation criteria*. 
   * I am not asking questions on this part for now, just included for completeness.d
* (2) *Estimate the return*.  
   * My question is whether my analysis is the right way to think about / structure a potential arbitrage trade.  
   * I lack experience in this realm and writing it out helps me make sense of it.

***Facts***

**Pan American Silver Corp.** (NASDAQ: PAAS) (TSX: PAAS) (""Pan American"") or the ""Company"") and Tahoe Resources Inc. (NYSE:TAHO) (TSX:THO) (""Tahoe"") today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Pan American to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Tahoe pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the ""Transaction""), creating the world's premier silver mining company. Shareholders of Tahoe will be entitled to elect to receive common shares of Pan American and/or cash in exchange for their shares of Tahoe. Additional consideration will be in the form of the right to a contingent payment in common shares of Pan American tied to the restart of the Escobal mine in Guatemala.

...

Pursuant to the Arrangement, Tahoe shareholders may elect to receive US$3.40 in cash or 0.2403 Pan American shares for each Tahoe share, subject in each case to pro-ration based on a maximum cash consideration of US$275 million and a maximum number of Pan American shares issued of 56.0 million, totaling US$1,067 million (the ""Base Purchase Price""). The Base Purchase Price represents a premium of 34.9% to Tahoe's volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") for the 20-day period ending on November 13, 2018.

In addition, Tahoe shareholders will receive contingent consideration in the form of contingent value rights (""CVRs""), that will be exchanged for 0.0497 Pan American shares for each Tahoe share, currently valued at US$221 million, and payable upon first commercial shipment of concentrate following restart of operations at the Escobal mine (the ""Contingent Purchase Price""). The CVRs will be transferable and have a term of 10 years. The total consideration, including the Base Purchase Price and the Contingent Purchase Price, is US$4.10 per share representing a premium of 62.8% to Tahoe's VWAP for the 20-day period ending on November 13, 2018.

t3_a4t636,Looking for Feedback on a thesis - Short AOS AO Smith,"The pitch is pretty undeveloped - most of the work has been trying to figure out if all of the legs of the thesis work in general so far. If I get encouraging feedback on this front, I'll work on formalizing the pitch and bringing exact measurements into the picture, especially around the valuation part.

&#x200B;

Thesis: Short AO Smith, degree of bearishness is contingent on Chinese view. Valuation on LTM EV/EBITDA is 12.5x is egregious compared with similar home product manufacturers in light of US difficulties and Chinese risks. The company has previously performed like a growth stock and has traded like one, but the company should trade at 7-9x EBITDA similar to comps like Generac.

&#x200B;

Key issues: Larger china exposure than the market is expecting. Market has extrapolated recent explosion in US commercial revenues as secular, but the increase was due to a regulatory change, and should revert to trend line revenues. US Residential revenues should also either stagnate or decline due to lapping replacement cycle from 2005-2007 era. 

&#x200B;

Overview: AO Smith makes water heaters, boilers and water treatment filters. Water heaters make up 90% of revenue. 64% of revenue comes from the US, 34% from China, and 2% from RoW. They’ve built a large Chinese business over the past 2 decades, growing from $50M in revenue in 2003, to $1.05B in FY 2017. The US market is a profitable oligopoly with AO Smith at roughly 50% mkt share, the rest split between 3 other players, and AO Smith has 27% market share in China in a highly competitive market.

&#x200B;

Key Thesis Points:

1.	China exposure

AO Smith has grown their Chinese revenue at a 21% CAGR from 2003-present. However, given the structure of the replacement cycle of water heaters, AO Smith’s Chinese revenues are very vulnerable to a Chinese real estate turnaround. 

&#x200B;

Water heater sales are split between newbuild and replacement water heaters. Replacement heaters are sold when an old one breaks down, so this volume is tied in effect to the number of heaters in operation. Newbuild heaters are sold when new buildings need a water heater. Water heaters are replaced on average every 14 years according to AO Smith (interestingly enough, because of improvements in technology, heaters are now lasting longer, decreasing AO Smith’s available revenue). 

&#x200B;

AO Smith’s Chinese business grew from $50M in 2003 to \~$1B TTM and I think that most of this growth is tied to newbuild residential construction growth in China. Given that AO Smith had \~7.5% Chinese mkt. share in 2003, and their revenues were $50M, overall China-wide revenues from water heaters was \~$650M. In 2017, AO Smith had 27% mkt. share and $1.05B in revenues, for \~$4B in total Chinese revenues. Given the fact that replacement volumes are driven solely by water heaters in operation, I believe that maximum water heater revenues are roughly $650M, at most say $1B.

&#x200B;

The rest of that $4B, $3B+ is extremely vulnerable to a slowdown in construction. In the US from 2007-2009, in a much less bubbly housing market, newbuild sales fell 66% (house price/income ratios of 3-4x, not the 10-30x of China). I think that in a Chinese real estate slowdown that newbuild sales would fall more than that 66% number. In addition, AO Smith owns the high end portion of this market, so I believe their sales are more vulnerable.

&#x200B;

2.	US growth will disappoint

US water heaters are split roughly evenly between commercial and residential sales. Residential sales are driven by the same replacement cycle, 12-14 years. I believe that both residential and commercial segments are lapping large increases in sales that have set expectations too high and will mean revert

&#x200B;

There are two parts to this point – first, US residential replacement volumes are beginning to lap the high newbuild volumes from 2005-2007. While newbuild revenues are a smaller portion of US revenues, the lap is significant. In 2006, 9.5M units were sold, with roughly 2M of those newbuild. In 2009, 7.9M were sold, with only \~600,000 newbuild units. That decrease should start lapping over the next couple of years, and replacement sales should start decreasing slightly.

&#x200B;

Second, AO Smith is losing market share in their commercial segment, in addition to lapping a 2015 regulation change that heavily boosted sales growth. Because AO Smith doesn’t break out revenues by gas or electric, I assume that they roughly mirror the industry mix of gas vs. electric. Modeling out the respective breakdowns, I find that almost all of AO Smith’s revenue increase since 2014 was due to higher volumes in the commercial electric storage water heaters in the US.  

&#x200B;

Please check the trade industry web site:[http://www.ahrinet.org/statistics](http://www.ahrinet.org/statistics) under monthly shipments and historical data for more charts. Here's the most pertinent one, of commerical water heater volumes :[http://www.ahrinet.org/Resources/Statistics/Historical-Data/Commercial-Storage-Water-Heaters-Historical-Data](http://www.ahrinet.org/Resources/Statistics/Historical-Data/Commercial-Storage-Water-Heaters-Historical-Data)

  

This is clearly unsustainable – with all water heater purchases, there needs to be a reason for the water heater to exist – you need to build a new school that needs one or replace an old gas water heater in an existing school. All this recent increase in revenue did was pull forward sales, but management has made no comment about this. I believe there is no reason for sales to not to dip back into 100,000 units a year territory. If you look at AO Smith’s 2017 10-K MD&A, they even admit that a lot of the recent strength has been due to pre-buys, or pulling revenue forward. Over the next 2-3 years I predict a 25-35% decline in commercial electric revenues over the next year or two, a decline of roughly $200M in revenues. 

&#x200B;

Valuation: I believe AO Smith should be trading at roughly 9x 2020 EBITDA. There are two scenarios – the US part of the thesis will execute regardless, but I have no real ability to predict Chinese macro conditions, and I’m just stating that if China falls into a recession, the consequences for AO Smith will be worse than the market predicts. 

&#x200B;

China: I believe this segment will turn deeply unprofitable and will be lossmaking or EBITDA breakeven, removing the roughly $140M it currently contributes to EBITDA.

&#x200B;

US: I believe the incremental $200M in commercial sales generated roughly $50M in incremental EBITDA.

There will be roughly 33% drop in total EBITDA to $400M, and at 9x EBITDA, AO Smith should be worth around $3.5B for roughly 45% downside.

	

Risks: 

&#x200B;

Price increases - highly unlikely, in my opinion. They already raised prices a lot in 2015, which accounted for most of their OM% from 14% to 21%. I don't believe that they'll try raising prices into a declining market. I've also found info that some of their competitors will be ramping investments in the US.

&#x200B;

China - I think the biggest risk here is that China will keep performing, which is entirely possible. Too many people much smarter than me have more insight on this issue. What I'm saying specifically about AO Smith is that from a long perspective, AO Smith is as levered as you'd expect to Chinese housing stability+growth, but that leverage is magnified on the downside. Caveat Emptor on this part.

&#x200B;

Commercial electric revenues continue ramping - Unlikely. The cracks already started to show 3 months prior, as you can see in July's data at the AHRI site. Volumes are now regularly comping 10-20% down YoY vs. 2017, and this was the source of the company's recent weak guidance.

&#x200B;

Thoughts? Criticisms? I don't know how to feel about the China angle, as I think it's very important and something I think the rest of the market isn't seeing, but the timeline for that is unknown and I could just be wrong that China is risky anyways. The US stuff alone is nice, but I'm worried it's not a big enough factor to contribute to real downside.

Sentiment is changing, and a lot of talking heads on CNBC and economists are predicting a recession or a further market pullback.

Mckinsey has a decent formula too but it is sort of vague as I have a hard time telling between Operating and Non-Operating Assets across industries.

I was wondering what you guys use for NOPAT and Invested Capital Calculation as I feel this is probably the most important formula for DCF.

t3_a691u5,How Much Wood Would a Kangaroo Chuck if a Kangaroo Could Chuck Wood? $KPT," 

Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers, $KPT, is an undiscovered company whose assets are accounted for at 1/3 of their market value on the books, their potential strong future earnings are not in the price and it comes with a built in margin of safety.

It is currently trading at 0.7x P/B even though its inventory, which makes up the majority of its book value, is carried on the books at a third of what it would get in the market and its future earnings, which I think will be strong and consistent, are not reflected at all in the share price. I estimate an 80%+ return over 2-3 years subject to approval to build a wharf which is imminent and their success in beginning operations.

t3_a68f44,Argan (AGX) Long Thesis,"This popped up on one of the Joel Greenblatt Magic Formula screeners. Anyone done any research on this stock? Currently trading at about $40 with about $28 per share in cash on the balance sheet. I think it has a very attractive upside potential with very little downside, but am looking for risks/counterpoints to this thesis?

&#x200B;

My catalyst here is that the contract backlog gets back up to the $1.5bnish range, and it could easily pop 50% (last time the backlog was in that range it was in the $60s). It's flush with cash, has no debt, trading at an EV/EBITDA around 2.5x... seems like a pretty low hanging fruit. I put together a DCF with a base base valuation of about $70-75 with significant upside above that.

In that time they’ve accumulated some 3% of shares outstanding. Also last year October there was a rights issue which was fully subscribed and in fact over subscribed by the substantial shareholders and management.

My question is, is it worth reading too much into the action of these two people? The business was growing fast from 2014 to 2017, but over the last one year performance has stagnated for both the top line and bottom line. The balance sheet is clean and healthy. 

In terms of their market actions, these two people only ever queue on the buy side, and never buy from the sell queue. The price a year ago was 50.5, it is now 44.0. In that period two dividends of 1.5 each have been declared. The price has been rangebound at between 44.5 and 50.5.

RFG is the only decent farmland REIT globally, all farm REITs  listed in the US aren’t great - although I won’t name names...

The company is perfect, except I am concerned about operations risk...


The group has recently sold a part of their operations to JBS Australia- a sub of the Brazilian beef giant JBS


My issue is that the Brazilian JBS is a zombie. The company has debts of 16bn on net income last year of 160m... this year it was minus figures


Once rates rise, things look pretty bad for JBS...

My question: would some form of debt defaults for JBS affect operations or the company and by extension the Australian arm, or can a company like this keep the show on the road while restructuring debt?

t3_a77i9z,Using insider activities to build an investment thesis,"Lately I have been following a company that I am building a liquidation thesis on, as I believe it is strongly undervalued to NAV, can liquidate at a significant upside to current share price, and can't really see an operational improvement from where they are currently (can't really use the cash & assets for good so why not liquidate?). I basically am backing my thesis with the insider behaviour of the management & major shareholders, who have been accumulating their personal stakes within the business extremely rapidly within the last few months. I thought that with no incoming catalysts to performance, the most likely explanation is that they themselves are trying to profit from a liquidation that they are planning. It really is amazing how the CEO has sank 40% of his personal net wealth into buying shares over the last few months alone, and I thought that really shows a very high level of conviction to back my thesis.

The issue is, I am uncertain how this would play out in terms of the legal ramifications. Since they haven't disclosed any public intention for liquidation, would it be considered insider trading for them to be buying shares? I feel like if this is the case, then there is no way they wouldn't have seen it coming and hence, the insider purchases are probably not based on my thesis.",7,0.78,1545105804.0
t3_a77grd,Opposite of Indexing: Private Equity BX KKR APO CG,"The whole sector has taken an absolute beating lately, although justified if we're heading into a recession in the near term, I believe these are fantastic buys at these levels if you can hold for the next 5 years. 

1. Private Equity  has gone through a fund raising boom, growing their AUM several multiples of what it was when they Came public.  There is over a trillion dollars of dry capital waiting to be deployed as opportunities arise.  The market is valuing the names below their ipo prices despite the fact that they are all much larger companies now than when they came public. 

     One of the biggest criticisms of owning these stocks was the lumpiness of their earnings , there could be wild fluctuations from quarter to quarter. In order to address this issue they have forced more LP's (investors) to tie up capital for longer periods which guarantees them a certain amount of fees per quarter which contribute a stable earnings stream to the parent company. 

3.  Another positive catalyst could be the conversion of most of the sector from a pass through entity with k-1 statements every year and complicated structures which many funds are not allowed to own. In addition to the complexity of this arrangement, being a pass through doesn't entitle them to be a member of any of the large indexes which keeps the shares from being owned by many institutions. 

4.  Dividend yields are juicy with some names yielding Near 10%

5.  These are the opposIte of indexing. If you feel passive investing had its day and active management is going to outperform these guys will do great. They thrive on market turmoil and actually welcome it as it gives them a chance to buy companies in distress and attempt to turn them around. 

6.  Possible change in laws to allow the public access to these funds. Blackstones Schwartzman has stated that there could be a time where the public could have their 401k invested in one of the PE funds. This would be a huge boost to the industry and allow AUM to get even larger and thus fee related earnings increase as well

The recent market movements are enticing me to move my portfolio more aggressively.  I've been looking at Bed, Bath, and Beyond stock for a couple of months now and at $10 it looks pretty cheap.  I'm concerned about a value trap though because it has an old fashioned business model and unlikely to compete with online retailers; in the very long term (10 to 15+ years) I'm not sure I see the business as a going concern.  Their margins are tightening drastically, the top line is stagnate but at ~7X normalized earnings and about 4X trailing, a history of distributions to shareholders and book value below market makes this look attractive.  They are still very FCF positve, the debt isn't out of control and recently has had ~5X interest coverage ratio.  I wold be concerned about an inventory write down but to be honest I've never stepped foot inside one of their stores so I don't know about that.  If you give them a conservative $2 EPS and below average sentiment ~5-10X P/E the stock looks pretty attractive.  What are your opinions on this?  What am I missing?

I personally disagree with this thesis because: 

* The alpha test of Battlefield V did not receive good feedback counter to their claim it did. I heard directly from the alpha test community that air combat game play was a disaster, weapons werent balanced, other problems with the netcode, etc. 
* EA claims they delayed BF V because they did not want to compete with COD 4 and RDR2 releases during the same window. But, because of the point above, DICE completely re-hauled the BF V code just two weeks prior to EA's announcement of the delay. Due to this, there was no way they could complete a satisfactory alpha / beta test session and meet the original deadline. 
* Fortnite impact on industry is a larger discussion, but has nothing to do with ""battle royale"" mode. 
* I disagree that video games are ""annuity like"" just because a new version comes out every year. Maybe MMOs since you purchase a subscription in some cases, but the examples he uses are definitely not annuities.
* No commentary on increased micro-transaction regulation risk or what % of EA's earnings come from that (its a lot). Surprising because EA's SW BF II micro-transaction debacle was huge news at the time.
* Digital purchases having higher margins and growing as a % of revenue share isn't a new thesis point.  
* Actually, the digital purchase gross margin benefit is likely over-earning at the moment because up-front sticker pricing will probably need to decline in order to get consumers to purchase games when the back-end, digital / DLC content component is beginning to out weight the content available in the original game build. 
* I don't really think the valuation is that compelling unless it was low enough to where you were getting the micro-transaction component of FCF for ""free"".

t3_a9r63y,Short Seller Citron Research turns from skeptic to a major bull on Facebook," (Reuters) - Short-seller Citron Research on Wednesday backed Facebook Inc, saying the stock could hit $160 in 2019 as the company's revenue and user base have seen little impact from the reported data scandals and privacy issues this year.

Shares of the social network rose as much as 4.4 percent to $129.57 after Citron's report. They are down 28 percent this year.

""We believe investors will be rewarded by the shift of user behavior to Instagram shopping and the personalization of the commerce process,"" according to Citron's research note [https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Citron-Research-Backing-Up-the-Sleigh-on-Facebook.pdf.](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Citron-Research-Backing-Up-the-Sleigh-on-Facebook.pdf.)

I recently had a conversation with an institutional investor about his investment process and I was struck by its simplicity. He explained that his primary focus is on EPS and whether consensus numbers are too high or low. Obviously share count is readily available so it translates to a focus on net income. The CFA candidate in me was skeptical. What about valuation? Isn't what you pay for a stock just as important as its earnings? If stock A is trading at a two turn discount to the industry, its a good buy right? It very well could be, but that relies on the assumption that all of the other stocks in said industry are correctly priced and that the market is somehow missing something about stock A.

t3_ac7w3h,Magnora Investment Case - Thoughts Appreciated,"Hi all,

I have been posting on and off on this sub and I wanted to post an investment idea I've been playing around lately. Would really appreciate any feedback. Let me know your thoughts !

Sovereign

========

&#x200B;

Magnora (MGN NO) is a legacy company based in Norway. It has no direct operations, following a divestment of its core business in 2017 and a return of capital (8.5 NOK per share) earlier this quarter. However, Magnora earns licensing revenues from two agreements: the Western Isles Agreement (where the underlying asset is operated in the UK North Sea) and the Penguins Agreement (where the underlying asset is being built in APAC). Magnora has a market cap of 342m NOK or 40m$, and 81.6m NOK in cash pro-forma for the return of capital.

&#x200B;

A. Western Isles Agreement

The Western Isles development consists of production and water injection wells tied back to a new build FPSO with oil export using shuttle tankers. The Western Isles Agreement gives Magnora the right to $0.5/boe produced and offloaded from the Western Isles FPSO during the lifetime of the FPSO (estimated to be 15 years, however Magnora has guided for a potential life of 20-25 years).

The FPSO is owned and operated by Dana Petroleum, which used to be listed but is now fully owned by Korea’s National Oil Corporation (“KNOC”). The Western Isles Agreement is KNOC’s largest project. First oil was achieved in Q4 2017, and the project has a daily production capacity of 44,000 boe.

Magnora does not have any operations but essentially just earns licensing revenues. The revenue from the Western Isles Agreement so far has been 6.8m NOK in Q1, 15.2 in Q3 and 13.8 in Q3. I estimate the run-rate revenue to be \~54m NOK per year (assuming 85% capacity on the 44k boe/d (vs 97% implied in Q2 and 88% in Q3 from the revenue numbers) and a 7.9 USD to NOK hedged exchange rate). At a 10% discount rate the 15 years revenue stream is worth NOK 7.8 per share.

&#x200B;

B. Penguins Agreement

The outstanding milestone payments for the Penguins Agreement are conditional on: completion of the unit (an FPSO), start up and successful production. The party the FPSO is set to be delivered to is a JV between Shell and ExonMobil so I would say there’s not a lot of counterparty risk here. The total nominal value for the total payment is 16m$ over 3 to 5 years. I’m not too sure what value to put on this – after all Magnora is not directly involved and the related parties may just fail to deliver, things could go wrong. Assuming a 50% probability and a payment of the 16m$ only in five years + a 10% discount rate, I find a PV of 43.2m NOK or 0.8 NOK per share. Assuming a 100% probability of success would push this up to 1.6 NOK obviously.

The co said it estimates office costs of 10m NOK which I value at a 10% discount rate, implying a value of NOK -1.9 per share.

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

SOTP, NOK per share

\+ 7.8 -- Western Isles

\+ 0.8 -- Penguins

\+ 1.6 -- PF cash

\- 1.9 -- Head office costs

**= 8.3 -- Equity per share**

Now the full value assuming the Penguins Agreement will be successful is closer to 9 NOK, while if you add an increase in estimated FPSO life to 20 years for the Western Isles FPSO instead of the current 15, you get to NOK 10. For a downside valuation, there’s really not much to say here beyond assuming the Penguins Agreement will never yield anything for Magnora and using a higher discount rate on the Western Isles Agreement of 15%, which would result in a 6.1 valuation per share for Magnora.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I think there is a bit of a value disconnect here, since my valuation gets me to \~30% upside. The implied dividend yield for next year is \~13% based on my 54m NOK revenues and 10m head office cost divided by the most recent share count. Magnora said it would look to return all cash to shareholders unless it found other opportunities. Management also has the possibility to buy back shares, which was granted at a recent EGM. I’m not too afraid of management re-investing in bad ideas. In fact I don’t expect them to reinvest much of the cash unless they find great opportunities. The team seems to have good background and reputations in the North Sea E&P space.

Overall, this is mostly a dividend yield play.

However, I would caveat that

a) this is a fairly illiquid stock, and some banks got stuck on the shareholder register in a reverse offering. As a result Sparebank is the top shareholder with 15%, I’m not sure whether they really intend to be a long term holder of this and they may dump the shares. I note that in the reverse offering (organized to get rid of a large annoying shareholder (Teekay)), almost all holders doubled their holding;

b) there’s no catalyst and no reason for the stock to appreciate beyond future dividend payments, and/or value recognition. There’s of course the small chance that management finds a great opportunity but I wouldn’t count on this.

t3_abzyx6,Share Buybacks are...,"I've seen it mentioned in this sub a dozen times that share buybacks are always a good way to gauge an investment in a company. Although this is true it should be noted that other metrics need to be viewed as well. 

A good example is Apple. In Q3 they purchased 20Billion worth of stock at 210ish a share. But in Q4 they have basically purchased nothing when the stick is at all time lows. Apple failed to see the decline in China sales as well as US. I just find it pretty notable that a big ""untouchable"" company like Apple would miss something like that. And I'm sure there are other factors. It's just a general observation. 

Long story short, buybacks aren't always accurate with ""company x feels their stock is the best investment."" This shows how insider bias can have big negative impacts for outsiders looking in if they choose to follow blindly.

t3_acyh0t,High margin cloud business soon a commodity? [Discussion],"In a recent interview Stan Druckenmiller stated that he's betting big on cloud companies like Salesforce, Workday and Service Now. He likens the current cloud expansion with the growth of mobile in the last decade.

&#x200B;

Currently Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are the leaders in this business. Meanwhile many other competitors like Oracle, Salesforce, Workday and ServiceNow are all battling for market share.

&#x200B;

With all these players (and more) will the margins inevitably come down over time? Do any of the above mentioned companies have any moats as cloud providers?

&#x200B;

I was thinking about it when I was taking a closer look at Microsoft. Their cloud business currently makes up a significant part of their revenue growth and delivers high margins. While I can see how their software business (Microsoft OS and Office Software) can sustain high ROIC over time, due to high market share, network effects and high switching cost for enterprises, I don't see how the cloud business will be able to sustain the high margins in view of all the competitors in the field.

Gurufocus uses the following approximation

>The following shows how to get maintenance capital expenditure.  
>  
>First, calculate the revenue change regarding to the previous year. If  the revenue decreased from the previous year, then the Maintenance  Capital Expenditure = [Capital Expenditure](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Cash+Flow_CPEX/AAPL/Capital-Expenditure/Apple-Inc) (positive).  
 Second, if the revenue increased from the previous year, then calculate the percentage of Net PPE as of corresponding Revenue.   
 Growth Capital Expenditure = Percentage of [Property, Plant and Equipment](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Net+PPE/AAPL/Property-Plant-and-Equipment/Apple-Inc) as of corresponding [Revenue](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/Revenue/AAPL/Revenue/Apple-Inc) \* Revenue Increase  
 Third, calculate Capital Expenditure (positive) - Growth Capital Expenditure.  
 If \[Capital Expenditure (positive) - Growth Capital Expenditure\] was  negative, then the Maintenance Capital Expenditure = Capital Expenditure  (positive).  
 If \[Capital Expenditure (positive) - Growth Capital Expenditure\] was  positive, then the Maintenance Capital Expenditure = Capital Expenditure  (positive) - Growth Capital Expenditure.  
 Fourth, get the average of the 5 years maintenance capital expenditure.

t3_ad3yeh,Stop obsessing over WACC!,"No one in the industry bothers to use wacc. DCFs are foundational, but so many people on this sub think wacc is a crucial component. Not true.

This is wrong. So many investors conflate volatility with risk. The idea behind wacc stems from the theory behind Capm where everything is couched in terms of expected return and random walk variance. Companies do not work this way! Risk is not volatility. Risk is permanent capital loss— the probability and the magnitude. When you discount, you consider the risk to the cash flows and ask yourself, what is the rate of return I would require to own this company? 

So if it’s a stable industrial company with a deep moat  and cash flows that probably won’t change, try 10-15%. If it’s a fallen angel, try 25%. Underwrite your thesis with a required IRR; THAT should be your discount rate.

Use some common sense. If a company is 10x D/Ebitda and a moonshot venture, don’t use 10%! No matter what your bs wacc inputs say! 

Be value investors. Gives Graham another read and focus on what’s important!

Edit: There is a condescending guy in the comments who misunderstood my point. Why might you look for 10-15% on a stable company? It makes you prove that there is a margin of safety. And yes; with such rigorous requirements, you are passing way more than you’re accepting. Use some common sense. If you’re going to deviate from the market 7% average, why would you require 9%? That’s such a stupidly low bar and leaves no room for error in equities (FI is a different issue).

Here's an article about their new capital raise: https://seekingalpha.com/news/3421399-annaly-capital-slips-capital-raise

This has been going on for a few years - you can see they did the same thing 4 other times since 2017 for a total of $3.5B raised. Look at their annual report here on page 12: https://www.annaly.com/~/media/Files/A/Annaly-V2/Annual%20Reports/2017%20Annual%20Report.pdf

Simultaneously, amidst these stock sales, they've been paying dividends of 10-13% the market cap, higher than almost any other company in the U.S. They don't lower the dividends. These dividends, which total about $1.5B per year, coincidentally add up to slightly less than the total amount raised over the same duration.

What I'm seeing is money coming in from new investors, and money being paid to old investors, simultaneously, while at the same time both of these values being *significant* portions of the company's total value.

t3_aggc60,Free Cash Flow vs. Payout Ratio,"I’m curious to know if anyone has any idea of what the historical tendency is w/r/t the evolution of valuation multiples for stocks that had consistently generated, or had sustainably raised as a result of operations, measures of Free Cash Flow to Shareholder Distributions. 


A bit a long, but this is how I would clarify:

For example, suppose a firm operates in what might not be considered a “high” growth industry, but due to its niche the operations generate a relatively high and sustainable level of FCF, and for whatever reason management is stubborn on raising distributions (e.g., closely held business with controlling shareholders that might not want cash distributions due to personal tax reasons). 

Eventually, something has to give, and since the level of reinvestment needed to sustain FCF becomes a lower and lower portion of FCF, it would (in my mind) make sense to expect an eventual higher payout ratio on FCF, as this is a more effective use of the cash that’s getting hoarded. 

Taking it a step further, suppose the payout ratio IS raised and there isn’t much, if anything sacrificed in the way of both maintenance and growth CapEx. It’s reasonable to expect increased demand from buyers like pensions/income oriented investors, as well as opportunists sniffing a fat PE target to bid up the float without an offsetting flow of sell orders (i.e., the bidding pressure raises the market cap and therefore the multiple). 

So back to the original question - what has been the result on multiples over time for shares with fundamentals that fit this broad description? 

More specifically, what has been the precedent for the magnitude of change in multiples relative to the market? It’d be interesting to know if this dynamic has a similar contribution to total return as the combination of building equity via sustainable FCF and dividends over the life of the investment.

First time posting here. I am a long term focused value investor (fine with 5-10+ year positions). I've been diligencing an online e-commerce business for the past year now I find compelling. As I've gotten further into this though I have noticed there really are not too many publicly listed online E-Commerce retailers. I'm wondering if anyone has seen any helpful fund write-ups or analysis to help think through a proper valuation. 

Rather than marketplace E-Commerce businesses such as Amazon or Ebay, I'm more thinking the speciality online retail businesses such as ASOS Plc (AIM:ASC), Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W), AO World plc (LSE:AO.), Zalando SE (XTRA:ZAL), Zooplus AG (DB:ZO1), boohoo group plc (AIM:BOO),  Ocado Group plc (LSE:OCDO), etc.

I know there is no one size fits all but I'm really looking for examples of different ways investors have approached valuation for these types of businesses. I'm not interested in the offline retailer that has an impressive online growth catalyst, but really these pure online retailers. These are often companies growing quickly and maintaining low margins that, assuming they can maintain strong customer economics and reach scale, should be able to demonstrate sizable dollar profitability down the road. Often some of the most interesting are committed to operating at near break even, allocating 100% of the spread between gross profit and non-S&M Opex entirely to marketing to acquire customers and lock expected long term profitable cohorts down the road.

I've seen people just look at TEV/Sales multiples, some attempts at an NPV on the customer base given disclosed customer economics (e.g. - LTV/CAC and retention, etc.), a terminal market share and EBIT margins x mature EBIT multiple, and several other approaches.

 If any of you have seen any interesting analysis or fund letters on these types of businesses I'd greatly appreciate it.

Although rating agencies directly contributed to the systemic risks w/ the housing market and AAA ratings on subprime MBS, they are the one of the biggest beneficiaries of the consequences. The lowering of interest rates to near zero (free) led to an explosion in corporate debt, and guess what? These bonds needed to be rated by MCO and SP.

MCO's market size grew 300% in about 10 years or about 12%/yr. This growth cannot continue into perpetuity.

t3_aj5tjh,Automated Strategy: Beating the Index [cross-post from r/algotrading],"Hi SecurityAnalysis, I'd like to share an automated strategy I came up with that shows some promising results. I'd like to quickly just share a broad overview of the mechanics of the strategy, followed by a look at the risk and return characteristics of the strategy. I am by no means a math whiz or investing expert, so all manner of critique is more than welcome.

# Mechanics

The strategy is pretty brain dead simple: at the end of every year, take an index (the S&P 500 in this example), filter out a basket of high quality stocks, equal weight those stocks, and hold for one year; rinse and repeat every year. The filter is an equity screen I made that I believe crystalizes a group of companies with best-in-class management, economic moat, and financial stability while also trading at an attractive valuation. This is *not* a predictive model, I cannot tell you which of these stocks will shine, nor by how much; but I *can* say that the underlying qualities these stocks were selected for will perform strongly. The final list of stocks is equal weighted to gain equal exposure to these qualities.

# ***Edit: Details missed and caught in comments***

* The portfolio holds between 25-40 stocks year over year with annual turnover of about 85% (remember though that it only trades once per year).
* The portfolio is sector neutral.
* Sortino for the total period is 1.89.

# Performance

To evaluate performance, I backtested this strategy using a Bloomberg Terminal for the longest time period allowed, which is December 1999 to present. In breaking down performance, I'll be showing the total return, as well as rolling five and ten year returns compared to the S&P 500.

&#x200B;

**Total Performance**

https://preview.redd.it/zp4dthgg79c21.jpg?width=670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5da3c032c9ae1eccfacda5d4ceef6d4851d74034

Over the 19-year period, the Strategy showed a total return of 866.3% versus 161.9% for the index with a market beta of 0.95. On a compounded annual return basis, the strategy returned about 12% per year versus 5.1% for the S&P 500. Regarding risk, the strategy showed a standard deviation of 16.3% versus 15.0% for the index. Maximum drawdown was also slightly higher for the strategy at -53.8% versus the benchmark of -47.8%.

&#x200B;

**Five Year Performance**

https://preview.redd.it/y9vpz68k79c21.jpg?width=694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1de7d74e09a2188e335a0ca388b43000834cc72

Regarding performance over five year holding periods, the strategy has outperformed the index during every single five-year period from inception to December 2018. The degree of outperformance was most dramatic during the first five-year period, while subsequent periods cluster around an average cumulative outperformance of 39.1%, or about 7.8% per year.

&#x200B;

**Ten Year Performance**

https://preview.redd.it/v2g7hmxk79c21.jpg?width=694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86a349fbaa66cddb9301db8ca20ae689a17e88d8

Regarding performance over ten year holding periods, the strategy has outperformed the index during every single ten-year period from inception to December 2018 .The degree of outperformance was again most dramatic during the first ten-year period, while subsequent periods cluster around an average cumulative outperformance of 86.6%, or about 8.7% per year.

This idea was covered back in late October and has since declined \~50%; though recently had a huge rally and is a potentially attractive short once more!

Short interest sucks though I believe the company has shown its hand on the massive dilution and insider selling to come in the near-term. Vol and lack of strike prices, liquidity make options likely a no go.

Notes:

Q: How do you make capital allocation decisions?

A: The base dividend is set at .20 per year. The board considers a supplemental divided in Q4, depending on how the business performs.

\- This year, TECK asked shareholders how they wanted capital returned.  Shareholders overwhelmingly requested buybacks.

\- Shareholders wanted buybacks over dividends.

\- On close of the QB2 investment, the board will consider more dividends or buybacks, balanced against business needs.

\- Management believes that the current share price represents a good value, so buybacks make sense in this case.  They pointed out that TECK trades at a low EBITDA multiple and a low multiple of analysts estimates of NAV.

\- Most of TECK's capital allocation for growth over the next few years is going to copper via QB2 and possibly QB3.

\- Management considers buying external assets, but in recent times haven't seen anything that meets their quality standards at a price that they can justify paying.

\- QB2 is in the works, we know.  But QB3 has the potential to share a lot of infra with QB2, making QB3 incredibly capital efficient.  QB3 decisions could come in the late 2020's.

\- Moody's upgraded TECK to investment grade last week.

\- The two other ratings agencies are waiting for the QB2 deal to close before making any ratings adjustments.  Expect more upgrades.

\- Investment grade ratings from 2 of the 3 agencies will save the company more than 50 million per year.

\- Teck is very positive about copper over the medium to long term.

\- Teck has considered expanding into battery metals to take advantage of the electric vehicle boom. Nickel may hold some interest.",3,0.81,1548450357.0

t3_alhi76,"Breaking down Alibaba's 2019 Q3 - Observations, Questions, and Estimates","BABA declared \~42% revenue growth and $1.84 GAAP EPS today and the markets responded positively. 

&#x200B;

Looks good on the surface, but my quick review shows some really interesting points:

1. Of total revenue growth (34B RMB) YoY, the main source of revenue growth in the core commerce, Tmall and Taobao and related advertising fees, grew \~27% or 14B RMB. Other growth Alibaba included was mainly owing to the new supermarket chain Freshippo, new sales from the search engine/retailer Kubei. In the same period, fixed costs went up 33B RMB (26B from cost of revenue). Gross margin dropped from 58% to 48% owing to slim supermarket margins and 11/11 discounts aimed at spurring more purchases to continue growing that day's sales. Meanwhile, you have little to no organic growth in international (apart from companies they bought) and money-burning initiatives in direct sales and what they call ""new retail"" that continue to increase losses while growth is fairly slow. 
2. I'm confused on how when revenue for sales goes up 27%, Cainiao delivery revenue went up only 15%? wouldn't it be a 1 for 1?
3. Operating income remained **unchanged** between 2017 and 2018. In 2017, Alibaba revalued Cainiao to generate 23B RMB in investment income. In the same period, they wrote down the amount they previously revalued for Alibaba Pictures (18B RMB in 2015 and wrote down 18B in 2017... suspicious), which offset this somewhat. In 2018 December, Alibaba revalued Kubei to generate 10B RMB in investment income. This grants them the ability to continue showing a net income YoY growth number, when it was actually flat.
4. Alibaba continues to bloat to its balance sheet from investing in subsidiaries, goodwill, and borrowing. There are no equivalents in large US tech companies where goodwill and subsidiary ""value"" account for more than 50% of assets. 
5. Net income was 33B RMB and Amortization was 3B, but cash from operations was \~65B RMB. Where did the other 29B RMB come from? 
6. Related to this point, FCF was 25B RMB, but for their 25B increase in short-term assets they also have an additional 40B in short-term liabilities. **They also spent 31B in investment while marking up their investments by about 60B in the same period.** So cash should have decreased, not increased here.

My eyes hurt from trying to adjust everything by the right amounts, but what it seems to me is that Alibaba revenue is actually slowing considerably for its main companies (maybe 15-20% growth fueled by lowering prices and deteriorating margins), offset by buying companies and continuing to revalue them. At some point it will mark down these big investments, but as long as there's another company to devour and revalue by 2-3x just by virtue of being bought by Alibaba then they can mask these deteriorating margins. 

&#x200B;

The cycle continues and their ""assets"" and liabilities grow. Strip away these ""revaluations"" and you get a messy conglomerate trading at almost 60x earnings with halted revenue growth in its core businesses and widening losses in others, without profitability in sight. The one bright spot is the cloud, but it's not a significant source of revenue yet. Offsetting that, Alibaba is hit by the China slowdown, hard, and this trend should continue. 

&#x200B;

**With real earnings flattening, the company is worth closer to $250B than $400B, so around $100 a share; if I'm generous at $300B here it looks like a 25% downside or around 133 a share.**",23,0.9,1548882476.0
t3_algvoe,Teck Resources Investor Conference Presentation Part 2,"Teck is perhaps the best run miner in the world.  It is a hidden gem, too.  Professional analysts seem to misunderstand what is going on at Teck.

Speaking with other investors about Teck, you hear lots of bologna.  This is my attempt to show people what I see: one of the best run miners in the world.  Value investing is a cyclical business and so is mining.  If I could design the perfect miner, it would look pretty close to Teck - buying during maximum pessimism, minimizing risks, and operating efficiently.  Teck doesn't do exactly that, but 2.25 out of 3 ain't bad.

We value investors make fortunes in years like 2009, 2004, and 1993.  And we go long stretches when we could make investments, but shouldn't.

Q: Where do you see the prices of Met Coal going?

A: Met coal analysts are too bearish, and too anchored to the low prices of 2015 and 2016.  Teck sees significantly higher long term prices.  (OP: Don't ask your barber if you need a haircut.)  Teck has not seen lots of new capacity come online in Met coal.

&#x200B;

\- Met coal for Teck generates ""enormous"" cash right now and they go on putting that cash away in the bank.  (OP: And reinvesting it into copper and shareholder buybacks.)

1. Using EPS instead of FCF in a DCF. The main motivation as I understand it is that stock price follow more Earnings than  FCF (this was outlined as well in this study: [https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejaecon/v\_3a18\_3ay\_3a1994\_3ai\_3a1\_3ap\_3a3-42.htm](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejaecon/v_3a18_3ay_3a1994_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a3-42.htm)). My concern here is that earnings as far as I can tell are easily more manipulated than FCF (i.e: buybacks?) - what are some concerns with this and do you advocate using EPS or FCF?
2. Using Equity Growth as a proxy for EPS Growth. This one I am still scratching my head. Could someone point me to a resource or provide a quick explanation why Equity Growth will be in many case a good proxy for EPS Growth? especially when the company wouldn't do any buybacks?

t3_ao6b2a,Valuing an Oil and Gas Company,"Hi all, 

&#x200B;

Wanted to ask some help in trying to value an Oil and Gas Company. 

I'm trying to value a small oil and gas E&P in Australia. I'm trying to do a Net Asset Valuation and have looked up the average Oil price and average gas price and used production to deplete the reserves year by year to get the revenues. 

I tried to use the cost of sales from the annual report as the cost of production. And used a decline rate of 5% for gas and 10% for oil, though it's shale and I'm not sure if that's too low. 

I have tried to minus the capital expenditure while adding back the depreciation and amortization. As would be done for a normal company. Hope that's correct? 

After using a discount rate of 10% to get the cash flows, I've managed to get a valuation. 

I had a few questions, I wanted to ask

&#x200B;

1. Are those decline rates okays? Are there any good sources to find decline rates? 
2. Is the method I used above to get the Free Cash Flows to discount by okays? The oil and gas accounting is a bit different so I've been trying to figure it out. 
3. The valuation I did based on 1P is very low and on 2P it's also a fraction of the market price. I am guessing this may be because the company has added reserves every year for the past few years and the market may also be pricing in higher future oil and gas prices. Is NAV usually a good valuation tool? Using relative valuations (P/E multiples, P/Reserves multiples don't seem to make as much sense for a value investor). 
4. Would it make more sense to try to factor in the number of reserves they'll keep adding in the next few years? 
5. I googled and found that some companies supposedly list PV10 estimates? but when I looked up a few annual reports, I couldn't find any of these? 
6. I had to make rough estimates of the cost of producing oil vs producing gas, let along selling them. Any guidance on this would be great

Sorry for the long list of questions, but any info would really help! 

Please do guide me to any resources, books or otherwise

t3_aopmz7,Equity Size Premium - Thoughts?,"Hi!

Just curious what's your opinion on including an equity size premium on companies with micro/small market capitalization, specifically the size premium indicated by Duff and Phelps' Decile Size Premia Study.

I noted that there are some opinion among academe and profession discouraging the use of size premium, e.g.:
- http://quickreadbuzz.com/2017/02/15/shouldnt-add-size-premium-capm-cost-equity/
- http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-small-cap-premium-fact-fiction-and.html

One of the things that I noted is that methodology of Duff and Phelps' size premium is relative to the whole market (NYSE), and that isolating micro/small-cap company returns to a small-cap index will eliminate/minimize the size premium (since required returns for small companies are naturally larger versus big companies).

Now after considering the foregoing, let's tie it up with the one of the methods of determining the cost of equity (which is determining comparable companies that will help us in deriving subject company's beta), and with Duff and Phelps' Size Premia Table.

If we put all these three together, do you think it is reasonable that if the comparable companies are also small-cap, we won't need to use a size premium? Or basically, should we use the size premium only relative to the comparable companies we are using? (i.e. not strictly using a specific rate for a specific market capitalization decile).",13,0.82,1549692029.0

I than started to research a little bit more and noticed that CSS had come down a whopping 75% in the last 2 years sitting at 6,88$ a share compared to 24.24$ book value per share giving it a P/B of 0.28 (i did not specfically search for low P/B ratios). There are around 8.8mio shares and around 75% is owned by institutions. Insiders have been buying lately (not massivly but there where no sales recently)


So i wondered if that massive drop and misprice ratio was justified and here is what i found (please correct me if i got something wrong):

The company took a big net loss getting a EPS of -7,57. They also have some debt at medium high levels. Both comes from 

1: acquisition of 2 companys (simplicity and Mccall)

2: Some heavy non-cash tax costs (actually i did not fully understand whats the meaning of this but that it should not repeat this heavily in the next year)

3: Moving parts of production from China to the US

I think this alone dropped the stock quite alot.


Next negative i found was that their sales in Brick and Mortar stores is going down on most products and they lost some major retailers selling the products. On the contrary Simplicity did good sales. On the earnings call they said that sales will probalby continue to drop year over year but they are looking on selling more online and have a consumer subsription service and a online sales app in the pipeline for 2020.

The stock is paying 0,8$ dividend wich is 11.6% on the stock price of Friday.


There is also some more mixed in because of the seasonal character of the bussines wich i think made the drop even stonger.


The EPS in the recent history was around 1.5-2$ and the market was willing to pay an average P/E of 14. The P/E dropped last year to 7,5. The analyst forward EPS is 0.96 and the EPS 2011 after negative EPS 2010 (-2.45) was 0.58.
The P/B ratio the last few years was around 1


So my conclusion:
This is not a ""wonderfull bussines"" i want to own for 10 years but it might be ""a cigar butt with 1 smoke left inside"". CSS will probably become profitable again somewhere end of this year or start of next year. 

I think the P/B will not come back fully to 1 but maybe around 0.7ish because the sales are declining.

I also don´t see a P/E of 14 anymore but rather somewhere around 10. With the forward EPS that would justify a stock price of 9.6$ if looking at P/E and around 17$ looking at P/B.


So my final thought is a goal of around 10$ per share by end of this year with a possible higher price somewhere mid 2020.


I don´t see a reason for the price to drop another 50% or so to somewhere 4$ ish but i see the danger of an general economic downturn dragging CSS further down. 


So, what did i miss? Does anybody see a trap? Am i too positive in the outlook? What other numbers should i look at for valuition (i looked at FCF and the other numbers but im still juggeling with to many numbers)

t3_aqg9xg,Dividends and share buybacks.,"Dividends should be paid when the company’s stock price reflects overvaluation (but not the opposite) and cash generated in the business is not put to better use in capital projects or expenditures (e.g. upgrading a factory, increasing R&D, meeting pay demands, engaging in a merger/acquisition, expanding ad/marketing efforts, etc). The principle being that the shareholder (=owner) may have better allocation opportunity for that cash (perhaps to invest in an  undervalued company) and should have a right to it if the company cannot allocate it as best.

On the contrary, it can be worthwhile to engage in stock buybacks when the company’s allocation options do not present a worthwhile return and the stock price is undervaluing the business. A buyback reduces the number of shares in a company held by the public. As a result, the fraction of that company that each remaining shareholder owns increases which also grants you more ownership of the revenue and profits. EPS goes up per share.

Purchasing your own shares (or that of another undervalued company, I might add) at a discount to intrinsic value is a coup of an investment. You may say that you already made your money, although not realized, on the instant of the transaction!

You may even suggest it is value destructive to do the opposite.

The tricky part if this all is having certainty of intrinsic value, and that is the secret sauce dripping off the best investors out there. The wonders you can reach by having this skill is limitless, however rest assured is impossible to determine true 100% intrinsic value.

Obligatory disclaimer: Of course, different taxation liabilities from these actions should be considered since they vary for different investors and jurisdictions. I am assuming all other things are equal.",25,0.86,1550121393.0

Olin Graduate School of Business

[https://youtu.be/IOXP-3STuzM](https://youtu.be/IOXP-3STuzM)

&#x200B;

The assignment for the class was:

Please read Part 1 of *Security Analysis* and answer the questions below.   
The goal of reading these works is to understand the investing philosophies and processes of successful value investors and furthermore to identify why their approaches have worked. Keep asking yourself:   


\- What about each approach appeals to you and what does not?  
\- How much of each approach was influenced by the investor's personality and how much by the external environment during which they were investing?  
\- How successful would each of these approaches be in the current investment environment?  
\- Where is their approach on the various 'dimensions' of an investment style (e.g. concentration vs. diversification, depth of research into each security, etc)  


You will get the most out of it if you take careful notes, note quotes/passages you found interesting, and questions that you have along the way.  
1. What's Graham's investment philosophy? Why does he think that's best?  
2. Which parts of his approach would you want to imitate? Which ones do you think you would rather not? Why?  
3. What's the difference between an investment and a speculation?

Seems like a long or short position, unless you are keeping up with the legal proceedings, is a straight up gamble, with little to no edge for you. It's a no-go either way.

*Originally published on November 14, 2018 behind a paywall then updated on January 1, 2019* [here](https://sites.google.com/kidkapital.com/kidkapital/blog/zg?authuser=0)*.*

**Context & Acknowledgements**

* [Zillow accounts for a significant percentage of my portfolio](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0cK-Ck461SYD1Uu6ZnfeLNDZjLq-mUbPFWsn-1o534/edit#gid=0) and it represents my largest individual investment.
* I started building my position back when Zillow [expanded its iBuyer program](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2018%2F04%2F13%2Fzillow-shares-plunge-on-plan-to-start-flipping-homes-rival-opendoor.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFmaFuhw2-Aq2NJzd1KfEEY3TA35A) in late-April 2018.
* Of all my investments I get by far the most hate for having Zillow in my portfolio and it is easily my most contrarian thesis. I’m even [betting against Steven Eisman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO73ksGQyqQ).
* While I would love to, I cannot claim credit for all of this work. My investment thesis was conceived using Ben Thompson's [Aggregation Theory](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fstratechery.com%2F2015%2Faggregation-theory%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFibyHmlNWcBnp8L2n7jyA99nE-fQ), which you can and should read about on Stratechery.com.

**Background on Zillow**

* When the company had its IPO in 2011, Zillow was crowned as the tech startup that would bring innovation to the North American real estate market, a notoriously inefficient and fragmented industry.
* Fast-forward to 2018 and despite growing its market cap from $539 million to \~$12 billion (at the height of its valuation), Zillow has fallen short of those lofty ambitions.
* Instead Zillow is a tax on the industry, an annoying but necessary toll that realtors must pay as a cost of doing business. The company operates as a glorified lead generation tool for real estate agents, who earn billions of dollars in commission on the Zillow platform.
* Since most of its revenue is driven by getting agents to advertise their listings on its platform, Zillow is excluded from the most valuable aspect of the real estate market (the home sale).

**Zillow's iBuyer Business**

* In May of 2017 Zillow [announced it would become a market maker](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.housingwire.com%2Farticles%2F40191-gamechanger-zillow-getting-into-home-selling-business-with-instant-offers&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEMEdjOMhA9rSgpHIXGQZ0CbD6NnQ), providing liquidity to the real estate market by buying and selling homes.
* The iBuyer business, called Zillow Offers, was initially tested in Phoenix but is currently available in Las Vegas, Atlanta, Denver and Charlotte. The company announced plans to expand the program to Dallas, Raleigh, Houston and Riverside in 2019.
* Zillow is not entering the ""home-flipping business"" as many critics mistakingly point out. Instead it is taking the approach of a market maker and thus, assumes a margin profile of 1-2% when the iBuyer business reaches maturity.

**The Opportunity**

* Home transactions are frequent in the aggregate, but most people only go through the experience a handful of times.
* A house is usually the single largest transaction most buyers and sellers take part in, which makes people understandably risk averse and willingly to endure a horrible user experience.
* The United States alone has $31.8 trillion worth of housing, of which over $1.8 trillion changes hands every year. That means well over $180 billion in real estate fees, the majority of which is pocketed by brokers and agents skimming 6% off of every transaction.
* There is a massive reward for disrupting the status quo and becoming a market maker for the broken real estate market. To do this any company would need to (1) fix the user experience and (2) bring costs down. That is Zillow's opportunity.

**The Price of Speed, Convenience & Certainty**

* All else being equal, using an iBuyer, like Zillow or Opendoor, is the superior method of selling a home. But all else is not equal as both Zillow and Opendoor charge for their iBuyer services.
* In 2016 [Opendoor charged a 9% fee for its iBuyer service](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mikedp.com%2Farticles%2F2016%2F12%2F13%2Finside-opendoor-what-two-years-of-transactions-say-about-their-prospects&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGVoieypEhQTwRFIN-N4kzy-z34aw). On its website Opendoor notes that fees can range from 6-13%.
* Zillow disclosed in its last two 10-Qs that the price appreciation (difference between what it paid and what it sold a house for) was 3.3%. Zillow doesn’t disclose what it charges the seller in fees but we can assume it's in the same \~9% range as Opendoor. Working off that assumption, the home seller pays 12% all-in to use an iBuyer service.
* The average purchase price for the 62 homes Zillow purchased in Q3 was $324,000 and the average home seller paid $38,880 in fees. Compare that to selling the traditional way, with an old school realtor, and the home seller pays 6%, or $19,440 in fees, before repairs and staging.
* At that kind of a cost (an extra 6% in fees), most critics are right that iBuyer is a niche service for a niche market: people who value speed, convenience and certainty.
* As its iBuyer business reaches maturity, though, Zillow has stated it expects to net 1-2% in fees, a price drop which increases the total addressable market significantly.

**Zillow Mortgages & Vertical Integration**

* In November of 2018 Zillow announced that it had completed its [acquisition of Mortgage Lenders of America](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.housingwire.com%2Farticles%2F47288-zillow-is-now-officially-in-the-mortgage-business&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHrWjHuLAOxcYwM9J1gXfZoc67GLQ).
* [On the Zillows Q2, 2018 earnings call](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Farticle%2F4195568-zillow-group-inc-z-ceo-spencer-rascoff-q2-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript%3Fpage%3D4&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF_lD74RFPeNzoz7-KQB3Xz2kmG_g) CEO Spencer Rascoff shared the company's plans. *""The mortgage business provides an opportunity to monetize the Zillow Offers business even further. So just what we intend to do here is, on a Zillow-owned home, when we’re reselling that to a consumer, we will provide mortgage origination for a homebuyer of a Zillow-owned home through MLOA, which we’ll rebrand post-closing the Zillow Mortgages.""*
* Homebuilders typically have a 75% attach rate on their in-house mortgage of homes, yielding between 0.5-1% of the loan in fees for every mortgage origination in addition to ongoing interest payments for a \~3% gross profit, or about $9k on $300k home purchase.
* Assume Zillow's iBuyer service reaches the point where it is only 2% more expensive than using a traditional real estate agent (the company's stated expectation) and on a house that ultimately sells for $300k, selling with an old school realtor would cost the homeowner 6%, or $18k. Selling it to Zillow, with the fees and opportunity cost, the homeowner is charged 8%, or $24k— a difference of $6k.
* But if the seller uses Zillow Mortgages to buy her next home (which could be a Zillow-owned home, or could be some other home), Zillow stands to make \~$9k from the mortgage business. Knowing this, Zillow offers to charge only 4% as a fee to buy the home, if the homeowner would use Zillow Mortgages for her next house.
* The homeowner sells to Zillow for $300k, pays 4% in fees ($12k). Selling to Zillow costs the homeowner less than using an old school realtor. But Zillow ends up making an additional $9k on the mortgage, for a total of $21k in income from the complete transaction. The consumer doesn’t care, because she has to get a mortgage from somebody to buy her new home. Might as well be Zillow and make $6k more on the sale of the old home.
* From the seller's perspective, the back-of-the-envelope math looks like this:
   * Sell with old school realtor: $300k – 6% ($18k) = **$282k to the seller**
   * Sell to Zillow: $300k – 8% ($24k) = **$276k to the seller**
   * Sell to Zillow then use Zillow Mortgages: $300k – 4% ($12k) = **$288k to the seller**
* Using Zillow Offers + Zillow Mortgages, the once disadvantaged home seller now gets the speed, convenience and certainty of an iBuyer while also yielding an extra $6k on the home sales. What percentage of consumers would use a service like this?

**Which Company Will Win the iBuyer Market?**

* Zillow, Redfin, Opendoor and many more startups + real estate agencies are now offering iBuyer services to home sellers. With so much competition, why is Zillow poised to capture the greatest market share? The answer is Aggregation Theory.
* Aggregation Theory describes how platforms (i.e. Aggregators) come to dominate the industries in which they compete in a systematic and predictable way. Aggregators have all three of the following characteristics:

1. Direct relationship with users
2. Zero marginal costs for serving users
3. Demand-driven multi-sided networks with decreasing acquisition costs

* Of all the companies competing in the iBuyer market, Zillow is the only Aggregator.

1. Users go to Zillow directly to look for homes as the company ~~captures 49.37% of all global real estate portal web traffic (compared to <5% for Redfin, its closest competitor)~~ captured 175.5M total visits in January of 2019 via [SimilarWeb.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/zillow.com) compared to 76.98M for [Realtor.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/realtor.com#overview), 37.11M for [Redfin](https://www.similarweb.com/website/redfin.com#overview), and 746.33K for [Opendoor](https://www.similarweb.com/website/opendoor.com).
2. Zillow incurs zero marginal costs to serve those users (i.e. it doesn't cost Zillow any more or less if 100 or 100 million people are browsing for a new home).
3. Zillow has created a two-sided market where its suppliers (home sellers, and the agents who represent them) are incentivized to come onto the platform on Zillow’s terms in order to reach Zillow’s end users, thus making the platform more attractive to those end users.

**Conclusion**

* This post is full of assumptions, many of which will turn out to be completely wrong. It is impossible to project what Zillow will look when it is firing on all cylinders but it's a relatively futile discussion in my opinion.
* The stated goal is to cover every part of the housing transaction and the total addressable market is so huge that you get silly numbers at almost any margin.
* Given Zillow’s current valuation and the size of the bounty at stake, I feel I only have to be directionally correct to see an attractive ROI. That's my margin of safety.",77,0.94,1550609234.0

t3_asw93r,Berry Global Corp $BERY Thesis,"**Background:**

Berry Global Corporation ($BERY) is a global company that sells plastic and rigid containers through their three components, Engineered, Health, Hygiene & Specialties, and Consumer Packaging. Blue chip costumers include Starbucks, McDonalds, Home Depot, and Walmart. In the past 10 years, they have expanded their corporation through the acquisitions of 19 companies, and 44 in the past 30 years.

**Thesis:**

Berry ($BERY) should return upwards of 30% given that:

1) Acquisition strategy has been strong

· Maintained high Net Income despite carrying more debt than their comparable companies

2) Shown consistent growth in current operations

· They have hovered around 3% organic growth

**Fundamentals:**

· $6.90bln MC; $12,304 EV, 24.8 EV/E

· $601m FCF in 2017, $630m FCF 2018, EST $670 FCF 2019

· $2.51 EPS in 2017, $3.71 EPS in 2018, 

· COGS makes up 82% of revenue, SG&A makes up 6%

· Gross margins of 18%

**Model**

· Maturity -3%

· Discount 5.5%

**Competition:**

· Sonoco Products ($SON) - $6.11bln MC, $7.17 EV, 40.9 EV/E

· Bemis ($BMS)- $4.82bln MC, $6.09 EV, 53.0 EV/E

**Risks**

· Having too much debt if they decide to bid for RPC and get accepted.

· Currency fluctuation as the company continues to expand internationally

· Consumer Packaging segment operating income went down 13%, EBITDA went down 7% from Q1 2018.  

· Wall Street predicts $0.97 EPS for Q2, I model it at roughly $0.85-0.94. Might be better to wait until after Q2 to get a better price.

· Continuously beats their own expectations, and highlight that in their investor relations packet. Always makes me question how honest the management is (under promising and over delivering). Small problem, not major as I realize many firms do this.

  

**RPC Merger**

· This is not built into my model, but I think that if it occurs, would be good for the company.

· £3.2bln MC, £4.4bln EV, 17.3 EV/E 

· Current bid is £3.3, not sure what it would have to be to get accepted.

I was wondering what your thoughts on Deep Value (typical high yielders like a lot of brick-and-mortar retailers) prospects during loftier periods of valuation are like versus companies growing sales/fcf at fast rates (>20% CAGR).

&#x200B;

After playing around with a few screeners for a while over various time periods, I'm getting that firms with high revenue yields on enterprise value / high free cash flow yield on enterprise value are performing very well in 2008-2012, whereas the prospects have sort of tapered off as index-buying has pushed up the market in general. For example, i'm only finding low-margin retailers and small oil/gas refiners as ""high-yield"" prospects right now - but we've all seen margins flip.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, it seems like companies that grow fcf or revenues quickly (usually the software / tech firms with no dividend and high ROIC ) sort of outpace the index buying and remain solid long opportunities into late-stage markets.

t3_aupxsr,How to play IMO 2020?,"The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN agency with regulatory powers, decided in 2008 that the sulphur content of ships’ fuel should be reduced from 3.5% to 0.5% from 01 January 2020.

A few figures to contextualize the regulation:

• The shipping industry accounts for \~ 7% of transport oil demand.

• The shipping industry accounts for 90% of Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions.

• 15 of the biggest ships emit more SO2 and NOx than all the world’s cars combined.

• One million cars emit as much particulate as one cruise ship produces in one day.

&#x200B;

I've heard a few fund managers talk about this but its not my area of expertise. Any thoughts on the best way to play it? One pitch i heard was higher tanker rates benefiting low cost shipping companies (in bulk and oil). Or buy refiners who can handle the switch (I have no idea who). Scrubber makers like Alfa laval will get more order but that is probably already in the price. Also I think it will be a nice demand boost for oil as ships wont be able to use their current feedstock and will have to use some other oil product. ",7,1.0,1551126674.0
t3_aupqij,Necessary Arrogance,"> At the root of value investing is the belief, first espoused by Benjamin Graham, that the market is a voting machine and not a weighing machine. Thus an investor must have more confidence in his or her own opinion than in the combined weight of all other opinions. This borders on arrogance, the necessary arrogance that is required to make investment decisions. This arrogance must be tempered with extreme caution, giving due respect to the opinions of others, many of whom are very intelligent and hard working. Their sale of shares to you at a seeming bargain price may be the result of ignorance, emotion or various institutional constraints, or it may be that the apparent bargain is in fact flawed, that it is actually fairly priced or even overvalued and that the sellers know more than you do. This is a serious risk, but one that can be mitigated first by extensive fundamental analysis and second by knowing not only that something is bargain-priced but, as best you can, also why it is so. (You never know for certain why sellers are getting out but you may be able to reasonably surmise a rationale.) This is the position in which investors should, over and over, want to put themselves (and an astonishingly different type of consideration than the great majority of today's investors are bothering to make).

Let's say I owned Wal-mart outright (took it private and owned 100% of the company).  I'm not paying off all its debts so we'll leave interest expense, etc. the same.  For this discussion, ignore any minority interest.  I believe I would earn:

- all of the net earnings.  That's after taxes, after interest, after capex - the Net Income on the income statement.  For 2018, that was $10,523 billion.

- all of the dividends.  From 2018's Cash Flow Statement, that puts another $6,124 billion in my pocket.

- all of the share buyback money.  Again from the 2018 CFS, that's another $8,296 billion I get.

Adding these three, Wal-mart throws off about $24,943 billion per year.  I say ""throws off"" in the accounting sense, not the free cash flow sense.

If I spent $100bn to buy Wal-mart, I'd earn about 25% annual return.  If I spent $400bn, it'd be only a 6% return.  I'd want my return to at least equal an index fund, and perhaps a bit more since it's riskier, so 10-15% return would mean I'd value Wal-mart at maybe $150-250bn.

Obviously, I'm ignoring future growth prospects, which greatly complicates the math, but let's pretend for a moment that Wal-mart is going to perform exactly as it did in 2018 for the foreseeable future.  With that assumption, am I thinking about these numbers correctly?",18,0.96,1551556258.0
t3_awr7e3,Discussion on risk expressed as beta,"Hello value investors,

I have been pondering on the topic of beta, or investment risk. I have been trying to use Discounted Cash Flow as a sensible way to evaluate a company but something about beta in the CAPM model doesn't seem very logical to me.

So beta is basically how the market reacts to news about a company. I understand that it would represent a risk to someone who would be willing to sell the shares he owns in the company but for someone who doesn't care about market fluctuations do you think using beta makes sense? To me it looks like my evaluation would be distorted by something that is not relevant.

 If you think like me do you have any other proposals or ideas how risk can be evaluated and perhaps incorporated into the DCF model? Or do you perhaps have any resources on the topic that I can check-up?

If you don't think like me would you care to try an convince me why beta makes sense?

Health insurers make a fucking killing on rebates, especially under Medicare Part D. In fact, an insurer may actually make money by 'paying' for a drug since a rebate can be larger than the cost. The incentivized arn't lined up since the gov covers 80% of the price under Part D.

* The company is publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker NASDAQ:ATVI.

**Industry Overview**

* Activision Blizzard is considered a major player in the video gaming industry

* Most recently, they signed a multi-year agreement with ESPN and Disney XD to provide live coverage of their Overwatch league which enables Activision Blizzard to tap into the huge potential of the rapidly-rising mainstream popularity of eSports.
* • Activision Blizzard also needs to be proactive and counter the rising mobile gaming industry which is projected to generate $180.1 billion by 2021, which steps have been taken with the purchase of King

**Strategy**

* Their current strategic priorities include welcoming new team owners to their *Overwatch League* and expanding *Call of Duty* to mobile in China16.
* In the past quarter, the corporation has released a variety of highly anticipated games including *Call of Duty: Black Ops 4* (the highest grossing game in the franchise), *World of Warcraft: Battle of Azeroth* and *Candy Crush Friends Saga*.
* Another growth driver, live operations, is one of Activision Blizzard’s larger growth opportunities as they surpass $4B+ in net bookings from in-game content per year.

* These trends show a sharp decline in stock price and at the time of this report, the stock price is still declining. Past trends reveal that Activision Blizzard has had a positive growth in their stock price for around 10 years.
* This recent decline in stock price is rare considering that the gaming market is evolving and expanding at a large rate.
* Activision Blizzard is a safer and low risk/low default company that has been successful in managing the interests of shareholders and giving

**Catalysts:**

* Rise of eSports which Activision Blizzard is nicely setting itself up for

Frost has a really low-cost deposit base. Banks normalized earnings potential have been masked by the low interest rate environment that reduces yields on loans and securities whilst operating costs remain the same. So banks margins are compressed. A bank makes money on the difference between the yield on loans and securities and the cost of funding and operating costs. There are some very good banks out there selling for very fair prices. 

My estimate is that Frost can return more than 15% on equity in the next few years. It’s very likely the return of the S&P500 over the next few years will be much lower than in the last 10 years. Not only that but with low interest rates a bank that can return 15% on equity is a great investment.

t3_b13piw,How did Joel Greenblatt earn great returns during the 87' crash?,"Currently, I have been analyzing Joel Greenblatt's investing strategy and his valuation methods. On the last few pages of the book, ""You Can Be A Stock Market Genius"", he reveals Gotham Capital's returns from 1985 to 1994. In 1987, when the stock market crashed occurred, Gotham Capital returned 29.4%. Which is spectacular, considering there was a big stock market crash. In addition, during the dot com crash, he also noted that Gotham Capital was down less than 5% during the crash. Looking at Joel Greenblatt, he is a value investor and leverages his returns using options. So, I am wondering if anyone knows how rarely ever lost money during these periods, especially during 1987 and 2001, during these stock market crashes? Also, 80%+ of his portfolio was in stocks and he was very concentrated, owning about 3-10 stocks.

t3_b1himc,Issues with YELP (Cut and Pasted from AIDVP site),"# Case Study: Do you really know what is going on at YELP?

&#x200B;

Leave marks where bodies are buried. That is exactly my feeling after I read YELP 10-K MD&A cliff notes. Let me explain.

**Troubling Text 1: (Pg 57 in 2018 10-K)**

>**Specifically, we agreed to indemnify GrubHub and certain related parties against certain losses arising out of Grubhub’s purchase of Eat24, including, but not limited to, any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by us or Eat24 in the purchase agreement. While Grubhub’s right to recover for many claims is limited to the funds being held in escrow, certain claims are capped only at the total purchase price. The date and amount of final release of escrow funds are subject to the resolution of any such claims. The escrow balance is presented on our consolidated balance sheets as another non-current asset.**

The issue here is not the escrow account, which is only 10% of the total price, but the highlighted line. That purchase price is $287.5 million. Why the hell would they tell us this now? Especially, why would they put it under liquidity and capital resources? A point that would keep me up if I am invested in Yelp.

**Troubling Text 2:**

**From 2018 10-K -**

>**In 2018, we recognized an income tax benefit of $15.3 million primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance previously recorded against certain deferred tax assets, offset by foreign income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased $46.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the gain on the disposal of Eat24 in 2017, offset by the release of valuation allowance in 2018. Income tax expense increased $30.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016primarily due to the gain on disposal of Eat24 recorded in 2017**

**From 2017 10-K -**

>**It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months there may be sufficient positive evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance. A release of this valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.**

**Why is this troubling?**

Because it is a great way to temporarily pump up net income. Note that valuation allowance is something management can have great control over. It is what an accountant call ""best judgment"". Right... It is like deferred revenue when management can't make the revenue number, they ask their accountant - ""how much deferred do I still have?"". The fact that no mentioning of what -""sufficient positive evidence"" leading to releasing a significant portion of the valuation allowance - makes me think ""really? Given people complaining about bad customer experience, fake reviews, low morale. "" Most importantly, they have done similar things for 3 years in a row - 2016, 2017, and 2018. Why would a growing business do that?

**Troubling Text 3 -**

From 2018 10-K

>**We expect provision for doubtful accounts to increase as advertising revenue generated from newer customers continues to become a larger percentage of our overall advertising revenue.**

These were added in 2018 10-K (page 54). Just for the record, it is a whopping 20% increase from 2017. If the number wasn't the biggest issue, then the underlying message is. As we all know, YELP has recently changed its contractual process with new customers. No more long term contracts. If no more long term contracts, why would existing clients not make up the bulk of the advertising revenue as Yelp has been around for years? Why would doubtful accounts increase so much when no long term contracts are required?

t3_b1mkjf,Case Study: ALARM.COM: Why are CXOs selling? A look via the lens of MD&A,"# Below are cut and pasted from aidvp site.

&#x200B;

# Since Sep 2018, more than $25 million worth of stocks were sold by ALRM executives and we continue to see them selling. What do they know that we don't? Let's take a look into ALRM's recent 10-K filing and look at MD&A cliff notes section, compiled by our AI. The quoted lines are the direct extracts from their 10-K.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""They are in trouble...""**

You probably won't be able to tell just by reading their 10-K. Let me share some of the findings with you.

Below is the link to the pdf. We use it ourselves to dig up dirt and avoid pitfalls. We hope it can help you also. It covers the past three years 10-K major and possibly material changes that our AI detected.

&#x200B;

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/dzgzbqhph728ms0/ALRM\_s\_Item7\_10-K\_Cliffnotes.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dzgzbqhph728ms0/ALRM_s_Item7_10-K_Cliffnotes.pdf?dl=0)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The ""tell good"" cash figure**

&#x200B;

On paper, ALRM shows 60.71M in CFO. However, The $3.5 million increase in cash from operating was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 but not yet paid as of December 31, 2018. If it was paid, CFO would have decreased YOY. EBITDA would be negative.

Do you know that the working capital figure reported in 10-K exclude deferred revenue, even though that they should have at least included the current years deferred since it is a current liability?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Our software license revenue growth 30% but...**

>**Additionally, the increase in the software license revenue was due to the timing of the acquisition of certain assets and** **assumed certain liabilities** **of the Connect line of business and** **all of the outstanding equity interests** **of the two subsidiaries through which Icontrol conducted its Piper line of business in June 2016 or the Acquisition.**

But I (ALRM mangement) made some assumptions on liabilities and all of the outstanding equity interests of the two subsidiaries...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Our contacts with customers (Adoption of topic 606)**

>**The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition policies, however, as a result of adopting the new standard, we changed our treatment of commissions paid to employees, which we** **previously expensed as incurred.**

&#x200B;

Let me speak in another manner - We still pay our staff the same way. It just in order to not affect our revenue figure, we capitalize their commissions and amortize its costs over a period of three years to not affect our bottom line that analysts look at...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The disconnect between Debt and Equity**

>**""On November 30, 2018, we amended the 2017 Facility to incorporate the parameters that** **must be met** **for us to repurchase our outstanding common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on November 29, 2018.""**

If you are a momentum trader, ALRM looks great. Up 50% and show strong support at 40. If you are a fundamental number guy, you love it. It has solid quality numbers - FCF/S at 12%, CROIC TTM at 14.4%. Five years annualize growth rate at 26.4% and GPA at 0.62. Looking great. However, why would the lenders restrain them from purchasing equity if the company that is so promising? because everyone else does it... But, cov lite is every where and terms are so loose these days. Maybe, they are not that promising. By the way, look at the date. Board prove the buy back on 29 and immediately, one day later, debt holder ask them to add the new parameter to restrict them from repurchasing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**We can lose it all if we default**

>**The 2017 Facility contains various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our capacity to incur other indebtedness, liens, make certain payments including dividends, and enter into other transactions without the approval of the lenders. The 2017 Facility is** **secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property.** 

The last part of the disclosure is very scary - The 2017 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. Why would any firm bet with everything if not desperate?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ongoing Intellectual Property Litigation**

>**The $40.4 million increase in general and administrative expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was due in part to a $39.9 million increase in legal expenses primarily resulting from a $28.0 million expense for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA by one of our service providers as well as this service provider’s sub-dealer agents within our Alarm.com segment.**

Litigation expense has increased 3 fold since 2016. In the most recent 10-K filing, there are 92 mentioning of litigation. Most importantly, its litigation expense is now 2 fold of net income for 2018. **Do you know that ALRM's executives are paid based on adjusted EBITDA, which exclude litigation costs?**

&#x200B;

**Executive Compensation**

ALRM uses Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under their executive bonus plan. Their Adjusted Ebitda excludes acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses. In 2018 Alarm faced a G&A increase of $39.9 million in legal expenses, which likely to continue with other lawsuits. Their non-adjusted EBITDA is 34.93. Because of their exclusion of legal expense (which is ""normal"" if not getting sued), their adjusted EBITDA is 93.1M for 2018. However, their NOPAT is around 14M if not account the tax benefit which is not even half of what it was in 2017 (NOPAT around 34M)

&#x200B;

Having built my fair bit of models before and on the job, and expectedly proficient in Excel, I still find myself spending hours on gathering and structuring data, forecasting and valuation. Thesis research aside, building the model from scratch takes a full working day at best. I find that most fundamental data accessible via Reuters or Bloomberg is poorly structured and difficult to manipulate, and often misses important segment information. Gathering other Non-GAAP info from publicly available materials is also a hassle. It's a shame because you're always trying to build your forecast off said data. Then the model itself - even without a mouse, linking various cells in Excel, switching between tabs, breaking down items to make projections etc. takes perhaps an hour (if you have a plan laid out), or longer (if you think about how to forecast EBIT on the go e.g. based off the revenue and cost drivers data you got and not just the margin).

&#x200B;

Valuation part is perhaps the quickest of these steps, yet still working out different inputs (say, WACC) takes extra time that seems better spent on thesis research. Is this a common experience, or am I just painfully slow? Could you guys share your methods for making this process quicker? Do you have any recommendations or shortcuts?

*(1) How likely is it that the promised event will  indeed occur?*  
*(2) How long will your money be tied up?*

t3_b575zg,Mulpha International Bhd (KLSE:Mulpha),"Overview - Mulpha is an investment holding company listed on the Bursa Malaysia selling at 50% discount to its net assets while earning profits and increasing the NTA. The primary activities of its subsidiaries are property development, resort owner/operation, commercial property and investment holdings. In fact, one of its investment holdings (ASX:AOG) is worth Mulpha's entire market cap (800MM MYR).

Mispricing - This is a discount to net asset play (Cigar Butt) on an illiquid, overlooked business where the chairman is a 45% owner. The source of misjudgement/price discrepancy comes from the fact that it is listed in Malaysia with the majority of its investments in Australia. Due to domestic bias combined with the illiquidity, locals from Malaysia/Australia are hesitant to invest. 

Valuation - It is currently trading at 800M MYR and has a reported NTA of 3315m MYR. The reported Net Assets is a look through NTA (since, ASX:AOG itself is also discounted to NTA).
The constituents are as follows: 
1) ASX:AOG is listed in Australia and is an owner-operator of retirement villages and Mulpha owns 22% (they also share the same chairman). Mulpha's ownership of AOG is 800 MYR. Once adjusted for the discount to NTA of ASX:AOG, Mulpha's ownership is 1500 MYR (almost double Mulpha's market cap). 
2)The other major part of its value is properties (mostly hotels/resorts and development sites). I valued those at 2100m MYR . 
The sum of the above is 3600M MYR. Less 2500M MYR total debt plus 480M cash/equivalents = 1580MYR Enterprise Value. This is a conservative valuation and although less than half of the reported NTA, it still provides at least a margin of safety of 50%. 

Management - The same management/directors used the Aveo brand in China without disclosure in the ASX:AOG business. Doesn't show great integrity. No dividends have been paid in the past 10 years but a special dividend was paid recently when one of the investment holdings (another cigar butt) was distributed to shareholders. A search for another related business Sun Hung Kai & Co. Limited (0086:HKG), that again shares the same management/directors, did not show any major red flags. 85M MYR (5.5% of NTA) of ""Provision of Financial Assistance"" to Mulpha Ventures with a 60% default rate in loans is a concern. The above are not ideal, however, the large discount is quite compelling. 

Catalyst/Potential Takeover - AOG has announced a number of offers for purchases of parts/whole business. Mulpha being a major stakeholder is in agreeance with the sale. While a sale to other parties would help Mulpha realise gains in the form of liquid cash (turning this into a net-net), Mulpha's takeover of AOG would be undesirable for Mulpha shareholders as it would require debt raising, share issues and the lockup of more assets into illiquidity.",3,0.81,1553495575.0
t3_b568zo,Why is Levered FCF / EV a flawed multiple?," 

Hey guys, just wanted to post a bit of discussion on  FCFF (Free cash to the firm) and its impacts on EV/FCF, FCF yield on EV, Free Cash ROA. I’m not in line with traditional finance methodology so I might be entirely wrong.

In terms of measuring profitability to shareholders, I believe Levered FCF / EV is the superior metric. FCF / Price is flawed in that impacts from payments of principal on net debt are excluded from the calculation. Although these do technically “clean” or de-leverage the book of a company, payments to principal on net debt just decrease interest and increase book value– but this does not increase future FCF (other than the interest impacts) since no assets are added. For example, a company with 100 B in debt and 1 B in equity might be mainly oriented towards creditors, and free cash flow might not be in shareholders eyes for a long time since the company might be stuck dealing with paying creditors principal or even just paying preferred share dividends. Even if “mandatory debt repayments” may be factored into FCF as short-term impacts, they are not provided over a period and so might temporarily depress FCF in a short period when the company has to pay back its debt. These sorts of firms have insane FCF / Price ratios since only interest payments are factored into FCF, but the impacts from net debt are ignored entirely (like Windstream holdings, and other extremely levered firms). I do understand that “cleaning” the book can result in allowing for additional debt offerings which can provide a company with fresh cash, but this is mitigated with the risks present in taking on debt (covenants). On the other hand, FCF / EV factors in the impact of debt principal in the denominator, since EV can represent impacts from preferred shares, debt (which can be refinanced), or other impacts like minority stakes.  If a company has a large amount of debt financing, then payments to principal on net debt might suck up a lot of FCF. These might not be represented sufficiently by a FCF / Price multiple as debt due in, say, 3 years won't show up in the current multiple. Nevertheless, FCF / Price is great for unlevered firms / firms without minority stakes or preferred shares. 

Also, UFCF / EV doesn’t factor in interest payments, only the impacts from debt principal in the denominator. This results in important miscalculations, since whether a firm pays 3% or 27% interest on its debt makes zero impact whatsoever to UFCF / EV. This means that its role as profitability of an entire business is entirely flawed. You cannot just factor out interest and use debt in the denominator – this results in excluding extremely valuable information on what interest rate is paid. Therefore, this metric seems flawed for its purpose. For example, Kohl's showed up on my screener - although they have to pay 16.6% of fcf annually just to pay interest. This excludes the impact of the principal they will also have to pay.

 Another way to think about why FCFF / EV might be misleading is a firm that takes out 100 B (exaggerated figure for clarity) in loans and receives 100 B in cash. EV will consider the new debt and cash to effectively nullify each other, and FCFF will ignore the interest payments. Therefore, the FCFF / EV would be the same, but interest would squander all of real free cash flow available for equity holders. Interest could even be so great that the firm might go insolvent. Therefore, FCFF / EV would represent the entire firm.. but would be a relatively useless metric for any shareholders. 

I understand this is not in line with conventional finance teachings, but I have no inclination as to what is wrong about using these updated metrics. The same logic applies for UFCF/EV as EBIT/EV.. EBIT does not reflect interest payments at all and EV just reflects the net debt principal.",7,0.74,1553488761.0

t3_b6544g,"SMTA, speculation play on small-cap REIT","**Preface:** I am not long or short SMTA I am awaiting more analysis, I want to hash through potential holes in my thesis. Criticism and scrutiny welcome and encouraged.

**The** **business**: 

SMTA (SPIRIT MTA REIT) is  an externally managed REIT formed in Maryland that invests in and manages a portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the U.S. that is generally leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to tenants operating within retail, office, and industrial property types. 

Spirit MTA was spun off from Spirit Realty Capital for risk mitigation purposes for latter's real estate portfolio.

**Basic Info:**

Price: $6.87 as of previous close (3/26/19)

Market Cap: $295M

Current Yield: 19.4%

Beta: 0.59 (Nasdaq)

**Dividend** **history**: 

Q3 18: $0.33

Q4 18: 1.33

Q1 19: 0.33

**Analysis:**

*The bad:*

SMTA has been absolutely hammered over the last six months, trading just below $12 in November to under $7 currently.  Red flags for investors include SMTA carrying a negative book value of equity due to accumulating a deficit, despite slight increases in the debt structure in the company. The Company issued $150M in preferred equity in 2018. There is a legitimate concern that the company may go into liquidation. They have already written off a sizable portion of their debt.

This is key:  As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was an allowance for loan losses on loans receivable of $35.1 million. $33.8 million of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2018 relate to an allowance on the B-1 Term Loan due from Shopko as a result of Shopko's bankruptcy. I am under the impression that this Shopko loss will be a one-off, but it is not the end of the road. From 2019-2023, Shopko owes SMTA $209M of $1,072M of operating leases (19.5% of  total op leases over that period). SMTA has sold off a small amount of their owned properties portfolio, which has contributed to less revenue. Revenue over the past few hears has been stable, but not showing any signs of growth.  

&#x200B;

*The good:*

SMTA paid a special dividens of $1 on top of their regular dividend of $0.33 in Q4. Let's adjust this to assume a $0.33 dividend for for quarters for a $1.32 annual dividend. If the stock stays in the $7 range, this will yield 18.8%.

Even when being conservative and assuming no special dividends, and no growth. And lets assume also assume since this company is not a going concern, so lets make the cost of capital higher than what they are currently raising.

They issued Prefered shares paying 10% dividends, they have raised debt at effective rates of just below 6% interest. 

&#x200B;

**Assumptions**:

WACC. Using Duff and Phelps CAPM plus High Financial Risk Size Premium here. I would like some feedback on this part, if nothing else.

Rf = 3.5% normalized Rf rate

Beta= 0.54 SIC 6798 Median Beta

ERP= 5.5%

HFR Size Premium= 16.37%

Total KoE= 22.8%

 Cost of raising further Preferred shares or debt will be more than in previous capital raises. I think using a weighted average of the cost of debt and preferred shares would inappropriately bring down the WACC. 

Reminder that the Dividend Growth Model is P0= D1/(r-g)

Case 1:

Let's assume no growth in the dividend over the next year for a divided of $1.32 over our cost of equity of 22.8%. This gives us a price of $5.79, indicating it is overvalued by about 17%.

Case 2: 

Let's assume small growth in the dividend over the next year, continuing with their special dividend giving us $2.32 annualized, but no further growth in the future with the same cost of equity. This would give us a price of $10.18, indicating about a 40% upside. 

Case 3: 

The company cuts dividends to $1 annualized, and indicates no future growth, with the same cost of equity. This would give us a prive of $4.39, a 37% downside.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

This stock seems to have a lot of question marks, especially with recent capital raises and high financial risk. If you are willing to speculate and are optimistic of the company's performance and a similar year. I am somewhere between all three of these cases, and from the relatively small time I've put into this analysis, I would not be surprised in either direction. 

&#x200B;

This is my first time posting a stock analysis on this sub. I would love your feedback.

t3_b5zg5t,Corridor Resources - Trades near net cash with positive cash flow and possible catalyst,"Corridor Resources is one of the more interesting, straight forward net-nets with reasonable upside that I've seen in awhile.

As at today's writing:

Corridor's Market Cap: $63.1MM

Management's forecast March 31, 2019 NWC: $63.4MM (99.9% of this will be cash)

Decommissioning Liabilities at Sept 30, 2018: $8.7MM

Net cash: $54.7MM

Corridor is a natural gas producer in New Brunswick, Canada who shuts in ALL of its production when natural gas sells at lower prices during the warmer months. The thing that benefits Corridor is New Brunswick recently had its main gas supply turned around and Corridor is approaching monopoly status as a natural gas supplier (although I wouldn't expect it to last). This results in the company achieving astounding prices for its natural gas >$8 CAD/mmbtu meaning it ends up cash flow positive (or will for the next five years if nothing changes, see below).

Now here's the fun part. New Brunswick has a moratorium on fracking, and Corridor has been in talks to lift the ban, at least for a few of its wells. This was driven by the New Brunswick provincial election where the new premier of New Brunswick happens to have been executive at the local oil refinery was elected in late 2018. You have some pretty strong tailwinds as well as the high natural gas prices result in Canada's highest gas bills which makes the population more interested in allowing fracking to bring  down those bills. Additional reading about the situation is here:

[https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/the-highest-gas-bills-in-canada-about-to-get-higher-as-east-coast-production-dries-up](https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/the-highest-gas-bills-in-canada-about-to-get-higher-as-east-coast-production-dries-up)

Other catalysts:

Generally, the issue with Canadian reserve reports is they have...very optimistic pricing assumptions as compared to what the market is expecting. Canadian companies use the forecasts of their reservoir engineers which have been recently predicting oil prices to increase steadily to >$90 a barrel in the medium term.

This is not true of what is in Corridor's reserve report. It assumes commodity prices which are much lower than what Corridor has been realizing. For example, the 2017 reserve report assumed $6.25/mscf for 2018 when they actually realized $10.58 through 9 months ended Sept 30, 2018.

So, with that said, the downside looks limited (presumably your floor is the current net cash balance with some adjustment for liquidation if it came down to it), and realistic upside is >50% and possibly more. The reality is allowing fracking might end up actually hurting Corridor if prices were eventually pushed down to what we're seeing in other Canadian markets which is a factor that's harder to handicap.

According to the book, these mutual funds had four attributes that set the group apart from the majority of active equity mutual fund managers: 

1. Portfolio turnover
2. Portfolio concentration
3. Investment style
4. Geographic location

Based on the process advantages as described in the book, many of these should continue beating the S&P 500 or at least as a group - revert to mean. How did they actually fare?

Out of the 20 mutual funds:

* 3 were closed, possibly due to bad performance (I did not validate this)
* 13 lagged the S&P 500
* 4 beat the S&P 500

The average performance of the 17 survivors was 13.66% (with possible survivorship bias) , lagging the S&P 500 15.58% by almost two percent. 

This raises questions:

* Good managers no longer  working in mutual funds?
* Good managers not working for the public?
* No good managers?
* US market efficient?
* Depending on cap size?

t3_b7fqs5,Biotech IPO,"I recently made an investment in Alector(ALEC) several weeks back at $15.99 a share.  Like many biotech startups they have no revenue, only the potential which is based on if the drug can get approved and actually works.  This company in particular has several drugs in the pipeline that is for Alzheimer's.

&#x200B;

The reasons for this investment were as follows:

\-Super CEO/founder= He has almost 400 patents and has a track record of building companies and selling them to big pharma($500 million deal with Pfizer for a previous company he founded)

\-Pretty lucrative partnership with Abbvie.  Where they negotiated that Abbvie pays them out $205 million dollars upfront now for a license deal.  Once the drugs are ready for commercialization they can either take a royalty or split 50/50 the costs to make and market the drug.  There's also milestone payments as well that add up to $900 million.

&#x200B;

Is a company like this pretty common in the biotech industry?  I rarely find biotech startups that already have a licensing deal/partnership lined up before they finish their drug phase testing.  Let alone one where big pharma is willing to pay out $205 million dollars upfront when the drug is not approved and is several years away from commercialization.

&#x200B;

To sort of backup my claim, I managed to find this company called BeiGene(BGNE) and they received a licensing deal with Celgene where Celgene pays them out $263 million upfront and then a royalty license deal with milestone payments.  That deal went public July 5 2017 and the stock went from approximately $44 dollars a share to a peak of $220 about 11 months after.

Even if it IPOs at an inflated value, assuming the price stabelizes is anyone interested in also owning this company? Its hard to look into the fundamentals of a private company any tips? 

BYND seems to have a major market share and frankly produces a product which is unrivaled at the consumer level other than impossible foods which only sells to resturantes. They also hold a sizable cash position which they intend to deploy to aquire other brands and from what I've read have low debt. This market share plus their aquisition potential lead me to believe they can be the biggest player in the growing vegan foods industry in the future. They currently run the vegan beef market and their new vegan sausage line is gaining market share fast. With the addition of possibly a vegan dairy line (beyond milk?) Which is currently 11B+ in sales worldwide they can be a juggernaut. With the aquisition or partnership with a company like miyokos creamery (small vegan creamery that makes dairy alternitive which is clearly the best from a quality perspective but lacks in supply chain and resources compared to larger companies like daiay) that would be a dangerous combo to the market.

Edit: also a good amount of people are dogmatically opposed to veganism and the average investor who has these oppositions to veganism might also allow these biases to have a unreasonably negative outlook when deciding to invest in a company like BYND leading to deflated pricing? Is this possible?

t3_b8cxjx,Sportsman Warehouse- SPWH,"**Industry**

The outdoor activities and sporting goods market is highly fragmented and competitive. There are four distinct types of stores; independent locally owned stores often known as “mom and pop”, specialty retailers such as Bass Pro Shops, sporting goods stores such as Dicks Sporting Goods, and mass merchandisers such as Amazon and Walmart.

U.S. outdoor activities and sporting goods retail sales in our related product categories totaled over $70 billion in 2017. The size of the pie is increasing as wildlife recreation has increased across all categories that Sportsman operates in. This increased participation is evidenced by numerous surveys involving recreation participation.

Over the past decade, specialty retailers, such as Sportsman Warehouse, have gained market share of equipment sales at the expense of mass merchants, discount stores and independent retailers, or “mom & pop” shops, which Sportsman believes comprise approximately 65% of the market.

In addition, while there are over 55,000 federal firearms licenses, or FFLs, in the United States today, only 4,000 are currently held by national or regional specialty stores. Since FFLs are issued at the store level, these statistics imply that the remaining 93% of the market is fragmented among mom & pop stores.

This fragmentation the market presents an attractive opportunity for Sportsman to continue to expand its market share, as customers increasingly prefer a broad and appealing selection of merchandise, competitive prices, high levels of service and one-stop shopping convenience.

**Company Profile**

Sportsman Warehouse was founded in 1986 as a single store in Midvale, Utah and has grown to 87 stores in 22 states. The company is the largest outdoor specialty store base in the Western United States and Alaska. The stores range from 15,000 to 65,000 gross square feet, with an average size of approximately 40,000 gross square feet. The company currently has plans to grow to 100 stores. The company sells hunting, shooting, fishing and camping gear.

The company believes it is less capital-intensive for it to open new stores compared to its principal competitors because of its no frills store layout. Stores generally require less square footage than the stores of its competitors and a smaller initial cash investment. In small- to medium-sized markets, Sportsman Warehouse is often able to establish itself as a standalone destination for customers. In larger markets, the company has successfully leveraged existing infrastructure to open stores in shopping plazas near complementary retailers. In 2018, the company expects to grow its square footage by approximately 3% as it shifts some cash toward reducing its debt balance. Over the long term, Sportsman’s target remains to grow its square footage at a rate of greater than 10% annually.

Sportsman effectively serves markets of multiple sizes, from Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or MSAs, with populations of less than 75,000 to major metropolitan areas with populations in excess of 1,000,000. It generates consistent four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales volumes.

Sportsman’s stores typically reach a mature sales growth rate within three to four years after opening, with net sales increasing approximately 25% in the aggregate during this time period. For the 40 stores opened since 2010 that have been open for a full twelve months (excluding our 10 acquired stores), Sportsman achieved an average four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.1% and an average ROIC of 74.1% excluding initial inventory cost (and 27.9% including initial inventory cost) during the first twelve months of operations. In addition, Sportsman’s achieved an average pre-tax payback period of less than one year (excluding initial inventory cost) and expect to achieve an average pre-tax payback period of approximately 2.5 years (including initial inventory cost).

**Moat**

Sportsman holds against the online stores as regulatory restrictions create certain structural barriers to the online sale of approximately 33% of Sportsman’s revenue, such as firearms, ammunition, certain cutlery, propane and reloading powder. As a result, this portion of its business is currently more protected from online only retailers, such as Amazon.

**Management**

Sportsman appointed a new CEO from the role of COO. Prior to joining the company in 2017 Jon Barker was VP Global Officer for Wal-Mart Stores. The current CFO has announced that he is leaving the company and the company is currently searching for a replacement.

**Valuation**

The company earned $.55 per share and trades at $4.8 per share. It trades at roughly 9 times earnings. Due Sportsman’s moat, expanding market share, and less capital-intensive requirements I believe Sportsman is a buy at current prices.

t3_b93al3,Help understanding truck leasing company accounting,"Hi all,

I am currently looking at valuing a truck leasing company, but am having trouble with some of the accounting related to the debt financing of the vehicles. 

The business uses leverage to acquire the truck fleet, part of which is collateralized by the vehicles, part of which is unsecured. However, when thinking about the cash flows generated by the business, I am having trouble understanding how this flows through.

Lets say they earn $3B in EBITDA, and have depreciation expense of $2B (no amortization). The EBIT would be $1B (lets assume no taxes), and therefore NOPAT is $1B. If you add back the $2B in depreciation, you have $3B in gross cash flows. Their CapEx on fixed assets is quite small, lets assume $300M, and the change in working capital (defined as current assets-cash-current liabilities, which does NOT include the additions to vehicles) is $30M. The math for FCF here works out to $3B-$300M-$30M=$2,670M. That seems like an insane number for 1 year's worth of FCF on $3B of EBITDA with a business with huge fleet expenses. However, the fleet expenses are in cash flows from investing, and are classified as non-current assets.

My question is, where in the FCF calculation would you factor in the fleet spending, and how would you forecast the accounting for that (i.e. do you forecast additions to debt to offset that on the balance sheet)? Would i include it as part of CapEx in the FCF calculation?

Thanks in advance.

t3_b91it5,Thoughts on how this applies in low interest rate environments...,"Hi all, I was reading Klarman's intro to Security Analysis and came across this nugget:

>Another standard is to invest when a security offers an acceptably attractive return to a long-term holder, such as a low-risk bond priced to yield 10% or more, or a stock with an 8% to 10% or higher free cash flow yield at a time when “risk-free” U.S. government bonds deliver 4% to 5% nominal and 2% to 3% real returns. Such demanding standards virtually ensure that absolute value will be quite scarce.

This seems to coincide with Graham's mechanical recommendation that stocks should have an earnings yield twice that of AAA bonds (although he specified the yield never be less than 10%).

Anyway, I'm wondering if, in such low interest rate environments, a FCF yield that is twice the risk free rate really offers an  ""acceptably attractive return to a long-term holder"".

In Canada, the risk free rate seems to be 1.96%--using Klarman's logic, would a FCF yield of 3.9% really be an attractive yield (assuming the stock's fundamentals were strong)?

Apologies if this is a silly question--many thanks for your time!

P.S. I'm thinking of using a required yield as a screen, then performing DCFs to reach an estimate of each security's intrinsic value.",14,0.87,1554315260.0

t3_b8sh0p,Consolidated Water Co. (CWCO) Long Thesis,"**Background:**

Consolidated Water Corporation (CWCO) is a seawater desalination and water distribution company. They operate in four main segments, Retail, Bulk, Services, and Manufacturing. Retail segment supplies water to end-users in Cayman Islands inn 2/3 highly populated areas given by government. Also has a desalination plant in Bali, Indonesia. The Bulk segment supplies water to gov owned distributors in Cayman Islands and Bahamas. The Services segment does desalination plant management and operating services and the Manufacturing segment manufactures & services water products from 51% equity in Aerex Industries in US.

**Thesis:**

My price target on Consolidated Water (CWCO) is **$19.12**, based on the following reasons:

· 13.5% growth in the next 5 years and decreasing to 9.32% in the terminal year. This growth is organic and driven by their increase in operations in Mexico and in the United States

· Market is expected to double by 2026

· No debt, $31m in cash which gives the company flexibility

· Long term contracts that are not set to end in the next 10 years

**Concerns**

· Their EBIT margins are around 15%, which is half of the industry standard.

· Bad acquisition strategy that turn a strong balance sheet into a poor one. However, given that their past acquisitions have gone well (Aerex Industries) so it is not a huge concern.

**Key Ratios/Statistics**

· $191m MC, $161 EV

· ROIC = 5%, Cost of Capital = 7.38%

· $31m cash, $1m in debt

· 2.67% dividend

&#x200B;

Current Price: $12.75

My Price: $19.12

Upside: 49.95%

&#x200B;

Hopefully you found this thesis interesting. The last one I did generate a lot of good questions, so I hope this does the same as I feel that I have gotten a lot better at modeling. I welcome all questions/comments, I personally do not have much experience in this industry so if there’s any red flags please point them out in the comments. Also, if anyone is interested in my model, I can send it to you. Thanks",18,0.86,1554258975.0

I’m Going to start looking into this market because it seems surprisingly under-appreciated and yet fairly profitable. The demand is expected to rise along with the entire airline Industry. Almost 50% of global aircrafts are already leased. China India Indonesia and the us are leading the passenger growth in the industry. 

Leasing companies relieve airlines of the financial burden of buying and owning the airlines themselves. They provide insurance and maintenance crews for them as well but I believe the airline is actually liable for costs associated with repairs. 

DCF method won’t be applicable because it’s such a capital intensive industry.

Peter Lynch also used log charts to help him manage his successful mutual fund.

&#x200B;

What do you extrapolate from this statement that can be made useful for investing success?

&#x200B;

A hypothesis that I would submit is that an investor should wait for extremes in logarithmic data, the greater the extreme in standard deviation, the greater the potential mispricing. The data that should be viewed in a log perspective should be not only price, but also other relevant and reliable valuation ratios that can be charted. The analysis would be made more reliable for stocks where decades of data is available, and where the fundamental story (past present and future) of the company is well understood by the analyst.

t3_bannoz,Airplane Leasing Industry,"The airplane leasing industry was a complete unknown for me until just recently. Because a couple of value oriented funds that I follow have bought both Aercap and AirLease, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at both. After just a couple of hours studying them, I became fascinated.

The business works more less like this: The company buys an airplane for 100M, it borrows those 100M at a 4% interest rate and then leases that same plane for a 12% interest rate (on the original price). If we take out the depreciation & amortization charges that are usually 4% (the plane’s lifetime is about 25 years), the operating expenses, and the taxes, there are 3% left, and that’s the profit the company makes (the spread). It’s a simple business model, and although at first sight one might think that there are no real barriers to entry, it's not quite like that.

Fortunately Aercap has an amazing capital allocator as the CEO. One that is constantly thinking about how to maximize shareholders returns and one who has bought back 35% of the company's shares outstanding in the last 5 years and still thinks the best investment the company can make is buying its own shares at a PE of 6.6 and a P/B of 0.75.

In case you're interested in knowing more about the business, here's my write-up.  [https://allinstocks.com/aercap/](https://allinstocks.com/aercap/)",37,0.83,1554686343.0

t3_be1c42,AudioEye & Aqua Metals - A Few Thoughts,"
Have been doing some digging into two deep value plays that I believe have a significant upside from their current valuations. 

The first is AudioEye, the premier player within the website accessibility space. Website accessibility lawsuits have entered into the thousands, with the majority of cases having been ruled in the plaintiff’s favor in Florida, New York, and California (I would encourage you to look into the Winn Dixie and Domino’s Pizza cases). Insider ownership is high at over 30% (one shareholder owns 50%, thus there is a very low public float) and the business is run by Dr. Carr Bettis who continues to purchase shares. The company uplisted to the NASDAQ from OTC during the summer of 2018 and remains cheaply priced for a SaaS based business growing at 100% YoY at 5.7x forward price to sales, 97-98% retention, and a TAM of what seems like $1bn. The company boasts over 1,000 clients including Uber (app+website), the Social Security Administration, ADP, Olive Garden, SoFi, WebMD, and my favorite, Crow Wing County’s website. 

The second play is Aqua Metals. This one is a bit more risky and should be sized accordingly. The company has developed a patented system for recycling lead acid batteries that outputs higher quality lead at favorable economics in comparison to smelting. The environmentally sound nature of aqua-refining has the eyes of major players like Johnson Controls (who has provided formal vendor approval for Aqua Metals) and Interstate Batteries (who has a 7% stake in Aqua Metals and is 49% owned by Johnson Controls, now Power Solutions). Johnson Controls has a stake in Aqua Metals as well. The thesis that has to be bought prior to buying shares is management’s (and now Veolia’s) capabilities of ramping aqua refining modules at favorable electrolyte recovery rates. The company announced that it has achieved 75% of the target recycle rate of its proprietary electrolyte solution (75% goal provides the company with break even contribution margins) and plans to achieve the 100% recycle rate are currently in motion and have been guided to be achieved by 2H2019. Testing has been extensive in smaller settings and I believe that the company will reach this milestone. The company recently inked a 2 year deal with environmental-health-behemoth Veolia to help with plant operations in Mccarren, Nevada. The terms of the agreement are such that Veolia will station 6 engineers at Aqua Metals HQ and in return will provide a critical ally in achieving an asset-lite operating model of licensing out modules upon achieving previously stated targets. Aqua Metals is issuing 2MM shares to be paid out quarterly to Veolia and Veolia essentially has call options to purchase 2MM shares after year one at $5/share and another 2MM shares after year two at $7.50/share. 

I wrote this rather quickly and can go into more depth into both equities if anyone is interested or has follow up questions.",33,0.91,1555460695.0

t3_bempha,FISV & FDC Merger,"I have been intersted in FISV for years. Curious to hear any opnions, especially about the technology at First Data, which seems to be ahead of FISV. here is a good summary from a hedge fund I like

FISV is a leading provider of bank technology, which encompasses account processing systems and ancillary solutions such as bill payment, card processing, debit payment and online/ mobile banking. One in three US banks employ its systems, on which run 140mn deposit accounts, while in 2018 it moved over $75tn and processed more than 30bn digital payment transactions. It supplies mission-critical services for which demand is non-discretionary and as a result, over 85% of its revenues are recurring. The company’s long-term track record has been exemplary, and EPS has grown at double digit rates for 33 consecutive years, but its revenue growth has been limited to c. 4% recently, because of a failure to execute effectively on some new initiatives and the continued consolidation of its core client base of small and medium-sized banks and credit institutions.

FDC is the world’s largest provider of both card issuer processing and merchant acquiring solutions.

The issuer processing business has more than 4,000 financial institution customers, 1.2bn cards on file, and deals with 25bn transactions annually. It can route debit transactions from 121mn cards over its “STAR” debit network/ rails. The merchant acquiring business provides payment acceptance solutions for both physical and eCommerce transactions and offers payment technology embedded within a wide range of software solutions. The company captures 40% of all US point-of-sale (“POS”) transactions, at more than 6mn locations, and >$2.4trn of annual volumes globally. The POS market has moved away from relatively standard legacy terminals to smarter variants, which offer a simpler on-boarding process and ERP-type software to small businesses, and FDC’s “Clover” product has gained significant traction with over 1mn of these terminals in use and payment volumes processed are growing by an estimated 40% YoY, off a 2018 base of $70bn.

FDC traded on 9x 24 month forward earnings before the deal, because of its high financial leverage (4.7x net debt/ EBITDA), its history of ceding market share to more nimble, technologically advantaged competitors, the market’s unwillingness (so management believes) to recognise substantial recent improvements and reinvestment in the business, and, finally a significant share overhang from its private equity owners (KKR).

We like this deal for several reasons.

It is highly accretive for FISV. The combination of $500mn of revenue synergies, $900mn of cost synergies and the re-financing and pay-down of FDC debt will result in over 50% accretion to FISV’s EPS at the full synergy run-rate. We believe the visibility of these synergies is high and that the company could achieve more because management does not account for significant platform consolidations. Furthermore, the accretion forecast is net of an incremental $500mn of technology spend, which we hope would have some pay-off.

We see the value of integrating FDC’s merchant acquiring solutions (particularly Clover) with FISV’s account processing distribution network. The vast majority of FISV’s banks lack a merchant acquiring offer, and the cross-sale of FDC’s products into their SME customer base will yield incremental revenues, add further stickiness to their customer relationships and improve their ability to compete with disruptors such as PayPal and Square. Merchants will likely want to use a solution from their bank because of the overall benefits of buying from one provider and their ability to manage their banking relationships through Clover (they will, for example, be able to obtain working capital finance from their point of sale terminals).

We also think this deal is more strategic in nature than the market realises. Scale matters in payments, and the deal will make the combined debit businesses of the two companies stronger, while the combination of FISV’s directory of 140mn accounts and FDC’s large merchant acquiring business could provide strategic optionality in this fast-changing industry.

We do not feel that FISV’s CEO would have risked his excellent reputation and the company’s track record to do a deal whose rationale hinged on cost-cutting alone and it is interesting that, since the announcement of this deal, FIS has merged with WorldPay, a higher growth, better positioned, but far more expensive peer of FDC.

The pay-off from this transaction should yield durable EPS growth over the next 4-5 years.",13,0.8,1555600382.0
t3_betorh,Linamar Corporation (LNR.TO),"Linamar Corporation is a global auto parts company (based in Canada) that manufactures powertrains and drivetrains for vehicle and power generation markets. It is the second largest auto parts manufacturer in Canada, behind Magna, with a market capitalization of $3.5 billion. The company is split into two segments: a transportation segment, which makes vehicle engines, transmissions, drivetrains, and bodies; and an industrial segment, which makes mobile-industrial and agriculture equipment. The transportation segment accounts for four fifths of Linamar's revenue.

At the moment, Linamar shares trade for $53.09. My intrinsic value estimate ranges between $66.5 to $73.5, with a rough target price of $70. If my price target is correct, Linamar has a potential Margin of Safety of 25%. While not quite a bargain, such a discount may be attractive to some given current low returns.

Linamar has a seven year average NOPAT/EV yield of 7.6%, and a current NOPAT/EV yield of 11.3%. The current ROIC is 11.9%. Over the past seven years, the highest ROIC has been 18.6%; the lowest, 8.9%; and the average, 14%. The capital structure seems fairly optimal, with debt representing roughly 30% of the total capital structure. Average seven year EBIT covers current interest payments 7.7 times.

Linamar has consistently paid a quarterly dividend since 1995. The current dividend yield stands at just 0.92%, however, compared with a 3.3% yield on the S&P/TSX index. While the company does not appear to have repurchased shares within the past decade, they have announced plans to repurchase up to 10% of their stock over the next year, in order to correct (as per the CEO) [""a significant level of under valuation of Linamar stock.""](https://www.fool.ca/2019/01/29/this-industrial-stock-is-buying-10-of-its-stock-should-you/)

While the company appears to not face any significant financial risks, it does face business risks materializing in the form of auto tariffs of 25%. How substantial these risks are to Linamar's long term prospects is hard to say (their 2018 annual report provides little insight into the matter). Linamar has only been minimally impacted by the previously enacted steel and aluminum tariffs. [For the time being, Trump has backed off the threat of auto tariffs, citing the threats as a ""negotiating point.""](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/10/02/trump-abandons-threat-of-auto-tariffs-on-canada-saying-it-was-just-a-negotiating-point.html) Personal politics will likely affect one's opinion on whether such affirmations can be taken at face value--I reserve comment. NAFTA negotiations may have scored a boost today, with a new congressional report finding that [free trade would likely increase U.S. GDP and jobs](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-impact-study-1.5104030). Ratification of NAFTA would be a plus factor going in the favor of Linamar's future.

The case for Linamar's undervaluation relies largely on the outcomes of trade policy negotiations. In my opinion, the likelihood and severity of auto tariffs on Linamar's general long term prospects do not warrant too much pessimism on that score. Linamar is globally diversified, and has room to grow abroad. Should decent conditions prevail, Linamar trades at an attractive entry price. Linamar has the size and financial strength to weather any reasonable vicissitudes that the future holds, and should create satisfactory shareholder value--barring significantly adverse conditions.

t3_bgk0gs,Is full ownership of businesses an underappreciated source of alpha?,"There are thousands of prominent investors who claim to be their disciples of the Buffet/ Munger approach. However as far as I'm aware (and I could be very wrong on this), most of these supposed value investing disciples only invest in publicly listed stocks /bonds. There are very few investor letters I've seen or public talks I've listened to, that discuss buying and holding businesses like Berkshire does. IMO full ownership has several distinct advantages over investing in publicly traded stocks. 1) Decreases volatility in the results of your overall portfolio 2) A good business will continuously provide you with new cash to invest, especially in market downturns where most mutual funds / hedge funds etc will experience capital outflows exactly when the opportunities to invest are the most ripe. 3) For the same reason, one can be comfortable in holding the underlying business through market downturns, since you keep receiving cash even though the market price of the business has gone down. Contrast this with an investment in a publicly traded stock. When the market tanks 25% no matter how good the underlying business might be your notional value has visibly gone down by 25% so it makes it harder to hold on. At the same time, your cash return is typically only the 2-3% dividend you  receive from that investment.

Given these advantages I wanted to know why so few investors focus on buying and holding entire businesses. Also, if I'm wrong and there indeed are many such investors out there, I would love to follow a few of them. So enlighten me either way.",10,0.92,1556044899.0
t3_bgazzf,Accounting for Uber's hybrid and equity investments made possible by divestiture,"The following questions I intuit can be answered by those who have an understanding of accounting common to companies with complex balance sheets, discontinued operations, and a history of divestitures and don't require a few hours venture into Uber's S-1.

&#x200B;

I am starting to dig into Uber's notes to consolidated statements which include details on extraordinary additions to the IS, BS, and CF.

&#x200B;

Essentially Uber records their equity investments in a joint venture with Yandex (MLU B.V.) by noting the net consideration (valued equity holding in MLU B.V. minus cash and equity contributed to MLU B.V. and other Uber assets within the geographical region of Russia) of their investment which saw them divest their wholly-owned subsidiary Uber Russia in exchange for 38% ownership of MLU B.V. and a board seat. This figure (net consideration) when added with the carrying value of assets transferred represents the gain on disposition. And the difference between the cost of Uber's investment in MLU B.V. and Uber's pro rated share of MLU B.V.'s assets is recognized as the basis difference which is largely comprised of equity method investment goodwill. Therefore, it happens that the carrying value of the investment is less than the fair value of consideration received by the 38% stake in MLU B.V. and greater than the basis difference or even net consideration.

&#x200B;

**Therefore, how do I reconcile carrying value if it is different from (in order from largest amount to least) fair value of received consideration, net consideration, gain on disposition, basis difference, equity investment method goodwill.** In addition, gain on unrealized investments impacted the IS greatly for FY 2018 based on the first quarter divestiture of Uber Russia and stake in MLU B.V., **how could one forecast the impairment account to equity method investments such that the carrying value is increased/reduced and added/subtracted to other income (expense)?**

&#x200B;

Secondly, Uber's divestiture of its Southeast Asian operations were made in exchange for Grab' Series G preferred stock which include a redemption right that requires payments of 6% interest on a compounded basis from the original amount of preferred outstanding. Due to this redemption feature the investment is classified as an available-for-sale debt instrument whose change in fair value is reflected in other comprehensive income (expense) on the IS.

&#x200B;

It seems to be a stretch to calculate preferred stock as a debt instrument when the only feature that would qualify it as a hybrid instrument is contingent on the lack of existence of a Grab IPO before 2023. **What possible reason would Uber have for classifying the investment as a debt instrument, so reporting any possible impairment could be avoided (that preferred is inherently riskier and the accounting may reflect as such)?**

&#x200B;

**More broadly, how should these investments be treated in the BS on a forward looking basis? How do they factor into Uber's value in a discounted cash flow framework?**

 On November 1, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Illumina, Inc. (“Illumina”) and FC Ops Corp., a whollyowned subsidiary of Illumina (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which Illumina will acquire us for $8.00 per share of our common stock in an all-cash transaction and FC Ops Corp. will be merged with and into us (the “Merger”), with us surviving the Merger and becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of Illumina. Completion of the transaction is subject to terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including expiration or termination of any waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and clearance under the antitrust laws of certain non-United States jurisdictions. At a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on January 24, 2019, our stockholders, among other things, approved the adoption of the Merger Agreement. We and Illumina have each received a request for additional information and documentary material, commonly referred to as a “second request,” from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) in connection with the Merger. The FTC’s “second request” has the effect of extending the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger until the 30th day after substantial compliance by us and Illumina with the “second request,” unless the waiting period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the FTC. The parties have entered into a timing agreement with the FTC that extends the waiting period of the “second request” to mid-2019. **We and Illumina continue to expect the Merger to be completed in mid-2019,** at which time we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Illumina and will cease to be a publicly-traded company. No assurance can be given that the required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, even if all such approvals are obtained and the conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals.

These are a capitalized intangible asset that gets amortized down through retained earnings, and replenished when new insurance policies are written.

&#x200B;

You net out reinsurance recoverables and premium receivables against the liabilities in the float calculation, which makes sense since that is money a company doesn't have and can't invest, but will get in the future.

&#x200B;

With deferred policy acquisition costs, that same logic doesn't apply.  That isn't a receivable that a company will get at some point.  I think it might be related to the fact that unearned premium is part of float, but can't fully wrap my head around it.

In my attempt to value Canfor, I computed an estimate of the company's owner's earnings to the firm. After carefully reviewing depreciation rates employed by the company, I decided that the depreciation figure provided was acceptable, and charged it against cash flows. Canfor's average five year owner's earnings yield to enterprise value is 14%, and its current earning's yield to enterprise value is 20.3%. The company has reported two owner's earnings deficits over the past decade, and an operating cash flow deficit in 2009.

The ROIC has been spotty, however on average it has been satisfactory. Over the past decade, the average has been 8.48%, and over the past five years, 11.45%.

Canfor's seven year average EBIT cover its current interest charges 11.7 times. Its bonds, $408 million worth, are backed 62% by cash, and backed fully by working capital. Its bonds account for 23% of the company's capital structure. Its current ratio is 2.63, and its quick ratio is 1.01.

The company has achieved satisfactory growth over the past decade--it is, however, facing headwinds due to oversupply in the lumber industry.

t3_bjh8np,FTR High Yield Bonds,"&#x200B;

From a fund, sorry about the formatting:

&#x200B;

By way of some background, Frontier is the fourth largest Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier

(“ILEC”) in the U.S. and provides telecommunications services to 4.5 million residential and

business customers in 29 states. The Company is an active high yield issuer with $18 billion of

total debt. The Company generates revenue primarily from the provision of voice and data

services over its own network to businesses and consumers within its operating footprint. The

Company traces its history back to its incorporation in 1935 as Citizens Utilities Company and

changed its name to Frontier in 2008.

Over time, the Company has grown through acquisition as the industry consolidated. In April

2016, Frontier acquired Verizon’s assets in California, Texas and Florida (“CTF”) for $10.5

billion. Unlike prior transactions, the integration process for the CTF assets proved unusually

difficult resulting in significant integration expenses, elevated customer churn and

underperformance on earnings that resulted in higher than expected leverage. Debt prices across

the Company’s numerous issues declined driven by moderating earnings expectations, credit

ratings downgrades and erosion in equity cushion.

While we maintained a conservative outlook on future earnings, we believed the market was not

making important distinctions among various issues of the Company’s debt. Specifically, we

focused on bonds issued by the Company’s operating subsidiaries. These bonds comprised only

$850 million of the $18 billion debt structure. Moreover, certain of these bonds traded down in

concert with the rest of the capital structure despite their structural superiority and more

attractive covenant protections (the “Subsidiary Bonds”). In fact, the Subsidiary Bonds were

trading at similar yields to the general unsecured bonds of the Company (the “Unsecured

Bonds”).

By way of a specific example, the CTF assets acquired from Verizon included $500 million of

Subsidiary Bonds. These were structurally senior bonds in entities with high quality fiber rich

assets that had been purchased for a total of $10.5 billion. We started buying these bonds in

August of 2017 in the mid-to-high 70 cents on the dollar range with corresponding yields in the

low double digits. At the time, a number of the Company’s unsecured bonds were trading at

comparable prices.

Over time, the Subsidiary Bonds continued to trade well and increased in price despite ongoing

concerns about Frontier’s operating performance. Certain of the Unsecured Bonds, however,

suffered significant price declines. These declines were particularly acute in some of the longerdated

maturities. Frontier has approximately 17 issues of Unsecured Bonds ranging in maturity

from April 2020 all the way to October 2046. For the most part, the nearer term maturities

(through 2021) traded well, generally in the mid-80 cents on the dollar range and above. For our

part, we focused our attention on the longer-dated maturities that reached prices in the 40 and 50

cent range.

As the Company’s operational metrics stabilized, we have taken advantage of these price

declines to create investments in the Unsecured Bonds at what we believe are attractive levels,

again, focusing on the longer-dated maturities. Based on a price of roughly 50 cents on the

dollar, these issues have current yields of approximately 15% (15-20% on a YTM basis).

Moreover, the leverage through the Unsecured Bonds is 3.4 times at market value (well below

the trading levels of comparable companies and the 6.2 times the Company paid to acquire the

Verizon assets). If the Company were in fact to file, we would be “creating” it at what we believe

is an extremely attractive level as all the Unsecured Bonds are pari passu irrespective of the

timing of the maturity. Said another way, we either continue to receive what we believe is an

extremely attractive yield or, in the case of a filing, become owners of the business at what we

believe would be a compelling valuation.

At present, our position in Frontier is approximately 3.2% of the portfolio split roughly equally

between the Subsidiary Bonds and other secured debt, on the one hand, and the Unsecured

Bonds, on the other. Our investment in Frontier has several of the characteristics we favor:

Small underfollowed opportunity within a large entity: While Frontier has significant sellside

debt and equity research coverage, the Subsidiary Bonds, with tranches in the $200 to $300

million range, were not well followed. Moreover, larger funds did not have the ability to execute

in these issues in a sufficiently meaningful size to support their interest.

Price moves unrelated to credit fundamentals: The Subsidiary Bonds benefit from strong asset

coverage, negative pledge language and structural seniority. This insulated them from credit

impairment during the period when the overall earnings outlook for the Company appeared to be

deteriorating.

Misunderstood risks: We believe the overall risks of the Verizon transactions were not well

understood at the outset by the high yield market. Our cautiousness derived in no small part from

the struggles other telecommunication companies, such as Fairpoint and Hawaiian Telecom, had

digesting Verizon assets. The market responded dramatically, perhaps as an (over-)correction to

its initial complacency, when the Company eliminated its dividend. While the market appeared

to view the dividend cut as a sign of weakness, we viewed it as an appropriate recognition of the

situation and an overdue correction in the capital allocation strategy to focus on debt reduction.

As a result, we were becoming more constructive on the credit as the market was trending

towards an excessively negative view of the company.

Further opportunities: Incremental investment opportunities in the Company’s capital structure

arose over time. As operational metrics stabilized and bond prices declined to levels we found

attractive, we invested in the Unsecured Bonds and also participated in new issuances of Frontier

secured debt.

Attractive valuation and upside potential: We believe our investments in Frontier are priced

below recovery values even if the company were to restructure or reorganize imminently. That

said, the Company has liquidity runway and is paying a significant current yield. Moreover,

modest improvements in reported metrics could significantly impact sentiment and trading

prices. Based on current trading levels, we are essentially “creating” the Company at less than 4

times trailing twelve months EBITDA. This is a healthy discount relative to cable companies

which trade in the range of 7.5 to 10.0 times EBITDA, while other telecom companies trade

closer to 6.0 times EBITDA. Lastly, Frontier is not a top heavy/high secured leverage company

so the recovery on unsecured debt is not as variable to small changes in enterprise value.

In summary, we believe our position in Frontier is structured as a “win-win”. While the

Company has stabilized its operations and is focused on cost cuts and debt reduction, it does face

significant maturities, particularly after 2021. As noted above, if the Company does file, we

believe (1) our holdings in the Subsidiary Bonds are well secured due to their structural seniority

and (2) our position in the Unsecured Bonds would allow us to “create” the Company at a

compelling valuation. In the meanwhile, Frontier has sufficient liquidity to continue to pay what

we believe is an attractive current yield on our positions. If the Company continues its operating

improvement and does not need to restructure, we will simply continue to receive those yields

and our bonds will likely appreciate in price.",2,0.67,1556718317.0

Fits a multimodal distribution, consider playing momentum come offering price even if it gaps significantly above opening. I'm going to be watching the range between the previously rumored IPO implied price per share at $120 bill EV (\~$65) and the next highest frequency of relative value price targets at $77-80 whilst playing momentum once clearing the $92 mark where there is a valley in frequency of price targets. **Note: This is not a long-run analysis, of which I'm still working on a DCF (revised PT @ $55 a share). This is if one is aligned with the heretofore zesty IPO runs.**

&#x200B;

By dissecting Uber into its constituent parts \[Ridesharing (Core Platform), Uber Eats (Core Platform), Uber Freight (freight trucking brokerage), Uber Elevate (Jump) (dockless e-bikes), Advanced Technologies Group (AV, Vertical-Take-Off-Landing)\] and using comparable companies that operate in each of those segments, Uber valued at $80-90 billion appears to be relatively undervalued on the basis of LTM revenues and gross bookings from each of its segments. It’s ridesharing business alone merits the valuation it will receive in the public markets.

That is, if you can appreciate the already frothy valuations of a narrative driven high growth comp set, Uber’s ridesharing business on an average/median implied TEV/LTM Rev/Gross Bookings foundation fetches between $88.2 billion and $108.8 billion of enterprise value.

Uber Eats (Uber’s online restaurant marketplace and food delivery segment) contains a lot more discrepancy in a sum-of-the-parts comp valuation with estimates between $12.7 billion and $61 billion in enterprise value.

These disparate figures are due to a comp set including businesses which happen to be either whole or majorly invested in the online food marketplace with limited percentages of their business dedicated to delivery (Grubhub, Takeaway.com) or of which outsource delivery to third-party logistics firms altogether (Just Eats). Therefore, when using implied TEV/GMV) averages or medians (which less information is available on then LTM Rev), it is harder to reconcile Uber Eat’s segment gross bookings (total dollar value of restaurant earnings, Uber Eats driver earnings, and Uber’s take) with peer gross merchandise value such as Grubhub’s cited total food sales which exclude a calculation of delivery fees either fulfilled on behalf of the restaurant or Grubhub. It is likely that TEV/LTM rev is a more accurate multiple on a comparable basis.

Uber’s freight trucking Brokerage business faced similar discrepancies on a percent difference basis of implied enterprise value. This is due to the fact that the comp set included both pure domestic ground freight companies solely involved in brokering shipments between shippers and carriers (Convoy) as well as larger logistics conglomerates which offer trucking transportation, warehousing services for shippers, and who fulfill a variety of different methods of transport including air freight, intermodal, and ocean bound transportation (C.H. Robinson). Therefore valuations were not only varied based on the scale of the comp set and differing maturities of the businesses (third/fourth private stage rounds vs. public 20 years+ companies) but also because of the differences in comparing TEV to LTM gross revenue and LTM net revenue which represents revenue less the cost of transportation and services. The cost subtracted from gross revenue to arrive at net revenue wouldn’t exist for a pure freight brokerage unexposed to the physical infrastructure required to move goods and therefore provides a valuation of Uber’s less capital intensive freight brokerage segment between $228 million and $1 billion with the more likely valuation range between $715 million and $1 billion.

Uber’s wholly owned dockless e-bike subsidiary is described alongside its ridesharing business and consequently fit into a category Uber calls “New Mobility”, owing to Uber consumers’ range of transportation options which are transforming the way travel within 30 mile distances is conducted. Due to the inability to back out JUMP’s revenues and gross bookings beyond that of only 2018 in addition to its peers, a valuation is harder to come by. However, Uber did purchase JUMP in May 2018 for $139 million with $100 million recorded in goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired’s net assets.

Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) which is largely purposed to developing autonomous vehicle technology was established in 2015 with 40 researchers from Carnegie Robotics. The AV wing of Uber has manufactured 250 AV units and has embarked on a trident partnership strategy with OEMs such as Toyota, Volvo, and Damier. Their partnerships are diversified in scope. For example, they have partnered with Toyota in 2018 to retrofit Toyota cars with their developed AV technology (a partnership with DENSO has also been added to the general agreement between Uber and Toyota). They are partnered with Volvo to develop their own fleet of AVs. And they expect to integrate Damier’s fleet of owned-and-operated AVs into their transportation network. Therefore, it appears that they may be targeting multiple approaches to enabling AV technology within their platform given the high degree of uncertainty that exists in AV with respect to regulatory environments related to TNCs, OEMs, and the pace of AV adoption itself. Recently, Uber has raised $1 billion from SoftBank for its ATG which has implied a post-money value of $7.25 billion for the group. The AV comp set includes the following: Waymo, Cruise, Tesla, Apple, Zoox, Aptiv, May Mobility, Prontoai, Aurora, Nuro, Damier.

A sum of the parts analysis with the most appropriate multiples (net rev vs. gross rev, gross bookings vs. GMV) when averaged places a value on Uber Technologies Inc. at approximately $141 billion. And on a median basis $119 billion. It seems apt that Uber is pricing at a little bit above their latest post-money valuation of $76 billion in light of Lyft’s oft decreasing valuation. It also happens that this pricing is on par with a relative valuation of their ridesharing business alone which seems appropriate given the company’s distance from profitability, the unexpected nature of AV, and the still nascent status of their “other bets” such as Uber Freight. However, what may be overlooked by those who forecast little to no upside for Uber at this valuation is the supplementary driver liquidity that arrives with the value proposition to drivers when both Uber Eats and Uber proper are opportunities for sustainable income making with one’s vehicle, in the case of Uber Eats even for those who have a bike or scooter. Ultimately, the Uber Eats business as both a marketplace and delivery operation is proven and gaining market share in their served geographies. This portion of TEV is what makes me confident in determining that Uber’s sustainable value is above what the IPO price implies.

Therefore, when taking into account how recent tech IPOs have been perceived by investors, especially concerning the fact that most of the segmented comps used to calculate TEV are private companies with less fervent private valuations, investing in Uber seems to have an asymmetric risk profile that would result in short term positive returns and which would only appreciate further insofar as execution begins to ramp up in the various bets that Uber has already invested a significant amount in and in the industries they intend to disrupt. Post-IPO they’ll be sitting on approximately $15 billion in cash which is nearly double the amount Lyft has on their balance sheet.

* Q1 Contribution margin (Lyft's KPI Gross Profit metric,rev-cost of rev ex cost of rev items amortization, sbc, and change in insurance reserves) increased to 49.6% from 35.4% in Q12018

&#x200B;

**Guidance**  


* Q2 Revenue guide $800-$810 million, $809 million mean street estimate, $803 million our model estimates
* Q2 Adjusted EBITDA loss guide $270-$280 million, $277.4 million mean of estimates

   * Q2 non-GAAP R&D (exclusion of SBC) will increase 2 pps from Q1 to Q2 and up 2 pps from Q2 to Q3 and Q4
   * S&M to decline to 28% of revenue in Q2 and remain at such a level for the rest of 2019
   * Non-GAAP G&A as a percent of revenue will increase 4 pps in Q2 from Q1 and peak at 26% of revenue in Q3 and Q4

&#x200B;

**Observations/Scrutiny**  


* It is moderately troubling that gross bookings isn't being reported especially when the counter intuitive explanation for not doing so were to avoid ""investor confusion"" as other segments of the business which have a negligible impact on the top line are areas where revenue equals gross bookings, i.e. Lyft owns their own capital in their e-scooter business. Gross bookings is a metric useful in deriving an understanding of the scale of a given TNC and calculating the implied take rate which is one component in forecasting driver liquidity and utilization rates. Reporting of ride milestones ""from time to time"" is a step down in the level of disclosure from the S-1 too. However, less disclosure on rides may be justifiable given that there are bike subscriptions that Lyft offers where an unlimited amount of bike rides are accessible for a fixed dollar amount. 
* Brian Roberts (CFO) cites reduction of S&M as a percent of revenue from 127% to 54% to 37% by 2018. This statistic isn't impressive as revenue has increased by 141% to 75% to 48% and is a testament to the benefits of businesses reliant on network effects anyway. 
* Brian Roberts also mentions that Lyft's ""strategy is to win on experience, not price"" while competitive pressure has ""recently receded"". However, it seems highly unlikely that either of these statements are true given that excess driver incentives and customer discounts have been more aggressively put forth by both Uber and Lyft. Additionally, smaller TNCs are able to gain market share or more aptly reworded in the case of ridesharing a shared market, given competitive pricing (see Via). 
* Logan Green (CEO) responded to a question inquiring about the performance of specific initiatives toward attracting riders and increasing the number of active riders, especially having done so in Q1 2019 to achieve a new record of active riders which increases each quarter anyway. Logan responded by mentioning the Shared Saver feature which is only live in 3 markets and the first rollouts of the bike and scooter in-app integration, both of which are new and currently limited features that don't relate to the increase in the record number of active riders vaunted on the call.
* Lyft is increasing the number of ESG snippets to contribute to their brand's goodwill in what they think will allow them to differentiate themselves from Uber and maintain loyal riders. Some of these actions have been voluntarily buying carbon offsets to make every ride on the Lyft platform carbon neutral and launching a program where riders who opt in will pay their fares in rounded amounts with the excess being donated to a ""handful of nonprofit\[s\]"". I remain unconvinced that this would curry brand loyalty. 

&#x200B;

**Notes**  


* Release of new product feature ""Shared Saver"" which decreases the price for shared Lyft riders by pairing nearby riders to the same pick-up location
* High-value mode ""Lux"" has grown twice as fast as the rest of the ridesharing modes such as Lyft, Shared, Lyft XL
* Introduction of Lyft Direct which provides a no-fee bank account and debit card where Drivers can instantly access their earnings after each ride and Lyft Driver Centers which offers discount on maintenance, repairs and car washes for Lyft drivers' vehicles

t3_bneixx,Contrarianism and Value Investing Philosophy,"There has been a lot of discussion surrounding value investing lately; what it is and whether it still works. 

Personally, I’ve always loved and agreed with Buffett’s definition in his 1992 Chairman’s Letter (midway from page 11 to page 13).

This thread is not about the financial aspect of value investing (i.e. purchasing companies for less than they are worth) but about the psychology (even philosophy) of value investing.

It seems to me that an inherent aspect within the value investing philosophy has always been to invest in things that aren’t loved by the market. A certain contrarianism has always existed. A bet against the crowd so to speak. A willingness to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Obviously, sometimes this gets us into trouble where we get drawn to “falling knives” and start being contrarians for contrarianism sake. We also sometimes get attracted to complicated scenarios or situations. Finally, value investors have historically tended to shy away from anything called “Tech”.

I’ve tried hard to fights against and correct these errors. I have been a successful value investor for a long time and credit the influence of Graham/Buffett/Munger for my financial independence. Having said that, the last 7 years have been completely flat and I’m struggling with the contrarianism aspect. 

When I speak with individuals and tell them I’m an investor, they immediately tell me they are also investors (including my barber and, more recently, a taxi driver). When I ask them what they invest in they usually mention either all or one of the FAANG stocks. Some of the FAANGs were even mentioned at the recent Berkshire Hathaway meeting.

In addition, when I ask people what they think of interest rates and inflation, a similar thread emerges: they say that inflation is under control, that interest rates are now staying put and that, in case the market ever crashes, the Fed is likely to immediately reduce interest rates to zero again (Greenspan put) to protect investors. That Amazon rules the world. That Retailers are dying.

Within the philosophy of investing, I’ve always found Mark Twain’s quote very helpful: “It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.”

This is the first time in my investment life where I’m not clear on “what ain’t so”. It is difficult to accept that the world has changed, that rational analysis no longer matters in investing. That one should just buy the FAANGs and be done with it.

t3_bo9ven,Status of the automotive industry,"In the last period, for some reason, I seem to find companies somewhere in the automotive value chain with good financial figures, decent management teams and relatively attractive prices (with respect to the current inflated asset prices all over the spectrum). 
Now, the problem is that I know little about the automotive industry, and investing in companies that deal with products that I do not understand very well makes me uncomfortable. 

If anybody could help me figure out a few things, I would be very grateful. These are the issues with which I am battling the most right now: 

-	I have the impression that the industry is going towards lower final customer demand in the short and medium term, and that prices are incorporating this. Do you believe this trend will keep going *ad libitum* in the long term? I live in a country where living without a car is almost impossible due to the extremely poor state of public transport, so I get a somehow skewed vision of the industry from here. If you believe demand will not pick up sometime in the future (medium or long term), how do you factor this in your assessment of potential investments? Do you skip the industry completely or do you just look for extremely low prices?
-	I thought that the downward trend was limited to developed countries, where the lower interest rate of the last decade helped finance car purchases and leases, but it seems like emerging markets are showing weakening demand and industry fundamentals as well (e.g. India).  What do you think the worldwide softening is due to?
-	Any additional thoughts you have on the industry as a whole are welcome. I am really just starting to look into it, so I am probably missing a lot of key information. 

Hopefully this will be helpful not only to me, but to the whole community as well. Safe investing to you all!

t3_boc9ye,Quantitative Impact of China Trade War on US Equity Values,"I posted this elsewhere without any response.  I figure this is a more appropriate place to come for critiques on analysis.  I know this is simple, and I’ve never done any macroeconomic analysis before.  I was hoping someone with more experience might give me some feedback.

——————-

So I did some quick math to see how the China trade war might actually effect the value of US companies.  Albeit with quite a few assumptions and simplifications in order to arrive at a reasonable ballpark estimate.

Assume a constant discount rate of 8% for the S&P 500.  Then a PE ratio of 21.5 would mean a projected 3.2% annual growth rate in earnings.  This comes from the infinite series:

Value ~= (Earnings)*[(Growth Rate1)/(Discount Rate1) + (Growth Rate2)/(Discount Rate2)+....] = (Growth Rate)/(Discount Rate - Growth Rate)

Where Rate = 1 + %,  i.e Discount Rate = 1.08

If Market Cap = Value, then PE Ratio = Value / Earnings.  So DR = 8% and GR = 3.2% implies PE = 21.5.  These seem to be reasonable results based on historical trends.

Next let’s assume that earnings growth is proportional to GDP growth, and that GDP is projected to be at a trend 2%.

Now assume that the trade war reduces the GDP growth rate by 0.5% (based on the worst case being reported), then earnings growth should be reduced by 0.8%.

Finally assume that this impact lasts 4 years, then an updated PE for the S&P can be calculated by separating the first four years into a finite geometric series, and adding the remaining infinite series:

PE = (1.024/1.08-(1.024/1.08)^6 )/(1-1.024/1.08) + (1.024/1.08)^5 *(1.032/1.08)/(1-1.032/1.08)  ~= 20.75

This translates into a value loss of 3.5%.  Even if some of these numbers are off a bit, the estimated change in value for the S&P 500 should be reasonably accurate.

Summary:
Going from no chance of a trade impact to a guaranteed 0.5% reduction in GDP growth for 4 years should lower the value of the S&P 500 by 3.5%, or so I recon.",9,0.72,1557797205.0

t3_bsmsmn,"Security Analysis - Implenia, 1.8 x EV/EBITDA","  

**1 Introduction/ Summary**

Implenia is a swiss construction and construction services company that is involved in infrastructure development, as well as building construction and civil engineering. The company had some short term operational problems in 2018, causing the stock price to decline over 60% from its peak in mid 2018. 

&#x200B;

According to SIX Swiss Exchange, insiders bought CHF 1 m worth of shares in December of 2018. 

&#x200B;

If the company can realize their guidance for 2019 and return to an average historical valuation multiple, there’s 78% potential upside from the current stock price in the short term (<= 1 year) and more than 150% in the mid term (<= 3 years).

&#x200B;

All of the investor information and annual reports are available in english on the companies website.

&#x200B;

**2 Strong growth in the last 10 years**

The company has grown substantially in the past 10 years. Revenues have increased by 7% annually to CHF 4,4 bn for FY 2018. The order book is worth another CHF 6,2 bn. 

&#x200B;

While the top line growth has been impressive, the margins are very slim. The company has been earning a 5% EBITDA margin on average, with FY 2018 coming in at just 2,1%. 

&#x200B;

Free cash flows have been positive over the past 10 years, with a conversion of EBITDA to FCF at around 50% on average.

&#x200B;

At the same time the dividend was steadily increased from CHF 0,70 in 2009 to CHF 2,00 in 2018, before being cut back to CHF 0,50 this year.

&#x200B;

With the current market capitalization of CHF 560 m and a net cash position of CHF 397 m, the EV is just CHF 163 m. With an EBITDA of CHF 89,7 m for FY 2018, the company currently trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 1,82.

&#x200B;

**3 What happened to the stock price**

In July of 2018, the company anounced, that long term CEO, Anton Affentranger, steps down from his position. Appointed as new CEO, Andre Wyss, a former Novartis manager with no prior experience in the construction business. 

&#x200B;

With the release of the Q2 results in August, the company had to revise its guidance, stating that „the \[record EBIT\] target \[of CHF 140 m\] will probably not be achieved this year“.

&#x200B;

In December, the company adjusts its outlook for 2018 yet again: „As of today, management expects to make value adjustments totalling CHF 70 to 90 million for the 2018 financial year as a result of one-time write-downs and lower earnings from ongoing business in parts of the International Segment.“

&#x200B;

Finally, the company confirms its December outlook in February of 2019: „The profitability has suffered significantly due to the value adjustments announced in December. The EBITDA amounts to CHF 89.7 million (2017: CHF 173.8 million).“ Furthermore: „The dividend payout to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting is CHF 0.50 per share (2017: CHF 2 per share).“

&#x200B;

**4 Why I think the company is cheap**

I valued the company against its own historical value, as well as based on an intrinsic value calculation with a standard DCF model. 

&#x200B;

Both methods show a potential upside of over 78% from today’s stock price.

&#x200B;

4.1 Multiple valuation, relative to itself

The company is currently trading at an EV/EBITDA of 1,82. The average valuation over the past 10 years was 4x EV/EBITDA. That’s including the depressed valuations at the hight of the european souveraign dept crises in 2011 and 2012.

&#x200B;

If the company can realize the EBITDA outlook for 2019 of CHF 150 m and return to historical average valuation multiple of 4x EV/EBITDA, the stock would trade at CHF 54,00. That’s 78% upside from the current price.

&#x200B;

If the company can achieve its mid term guidance (which it still confirms after lackluster 2018), i.e. CHF 5 bn in revenues, 5,25% EBITDA margin at the low end and 5,75% at the high end, the share price could go up to CHF 78,35 and CHF 83,76 respectively, assuming a 4x EV/EBITDA multiple. That‘s 158% to 173% upside from today‘s price.

&#x200B;

4.2 DCF valuation

The DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of CHF 68,06 per share, assuming a low annual revenue growth rate of 2%, returning back to 5% EBITDA margin and a 10% discount rate.

&#x200B;

**5 Macro tailwinds**

5.1 Interest rates; short to mid term

Low interest rates facilitate higher spending in infrastructur. The ECB interest rate is currently at 0% and not expected to increase any time soon. In Switzerland interest rates are actually negative.

&#x200B;

5.2 Increased government spending; short to mid term

At 0% interest rate, monetary policy is exhausted as a means to facilitate growth in Europe. With decelarating growth or even a recession, governments will have to increase their spending in infrastructure in order to help the economy. 

&#x200B;

5.3 Mobility and infrastructure investments; long term

By 2035, CHF 2,4 trillion will be invested in economic infrastructure in Western Europe (vs. CHF 1,9 trillion in 2017).

&#x200B;

5.4 Urbanisation; long term

By 2050, 87% of the population of Western Europe is expected to live in urban areas (vs. 79% in 2018). 

&#x200B;

**6 What could go wrong**

6.1 The new CEO

Wyss might not be able to follow in the foot steps of Affentranger and continue the trajectory his predecessor had put the company on. 

&#x200B;

Although Affentranger should get a lot of credit for the growth of the last 10 years, many shareholders have critized him for being solely focused on top line growth to the detriment of the bottom line. The new CEO has the opportunity to get the company on a path of more moderate, but profitable growth, which he has already communicated as one of his priorities.

&#x200B;

Besides, current chairman of the supervisory board, Hans Ulrich-Meister, a former high ranking Credit Suisse manager, is not known to be a passive bystander. If things should go south with the new CEO, he will step in.

&#x200B;

6.2 Deeper issues with the international business 

Admittedly, it‘s hard to asses the extent of the operational issues with the international business from the outside. The company has said that the problem is contained and no further depreciation of the project in question is expected. They‘ve already put measures in place to prevent similar incidents in the future. 

&#x200B;

6.3 Macro headwinds

Implenia has already proven to be fundamentally robust to adverse macro environments. They were able to increase revenues and earn constant margins during the great financial crisis and the european souveraign debt crisis.

t3_bsfqdj,Is RLGY a steal or a value trap?,"I need to read earlier annual reports to get a better picture of the company's operating history, but from the numbers, it looks like they did a capital restructuring in 2012, reducing debt in exchange for a lot of share dilution.

In 2013, with free cash flow of $492 they had a market cap of $7.2b. Through the restructuring process the company always maintained EBIDTA of $500m+, an EBITDA margin on sales of about 12.5%. EBITDA margin in 2018 has declined to about 11%.

Free cash flows for 2018 were $394m.

I understand there are some competitive pressures from Berkshire Hathaway and Zillow. BH has had some very positive numbers and has the greatest ability to expand by acquisition. Zillow is extremely disruptive and potentially more so in the future, but so far they are playing with the realtor community, probably because most buyers/sellers prefer to work with a human being for this type transaction.  On March 27, BH ranked Number 1 in US residential real estate, BH HomeServices [surpassed](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/real-trends-500-report-ranks-nations-largest-real-estate-firms-300819128.html) Realogy's ([RLGY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RLGY) \-0.5%) NRT unit this year, which logged in 337,235 transaction sides closed. Sounds very intimidating, but its not like HomeServices got bigger the same way Geico did, via organic growth, it's via acquisitions, so its less intimidating. I'd imagine Berkshire continue to pile money into this business if it can make them a satisfactory return on capital.

But the brands under RLGY are not to be sneezed at, Better Homes, Century 21, Coldwell Banker, ERA, and Sotheby's are each individual brands that any reasonable buyer or seller would not blink to do business with. I haven't had time yet to look at the other brands that I know less about.

Recent quarter results were worse than last year and for the first time in a decade they reported a quarterly EBITDA loss. Q1 always has negative net income, although this year was much larger than usual: Since 2014, net income for Q1 has been: -$46, -$32, -$42, -$28, -$67, -$99 (2019). Due to 9% decline in quarterly revenue.

Q1 2019 operating EBITDA was negative $4M vs. positive $34M a year ago.

An executive recently bought $1,000,000 of shares  @ $8.38 on May 8, stock currently trades @ $7.13.

Most of the above summary should set off red lights.

EBITDA to Interest Expense ratio is currently 2.82 (2.49 in 2013, 2.68 in 2014, 3.26 in 2015, 4.37 in 2016, 4.52 in 2017, 4.38 in 2018).

Management claims to pursue up to $70m in annual cost savings. This will no doubt further compress margins in the meanwhile.

Current market cap is $814m, EV is: $4.5b.

They earned $394m in free cash flow last year, bought back $402m of stock, while adding $250m of debt.

Dividend is about $40m per year, or about 5%.

Bonds are trading at $91, $94, $99, and $100 for 7.4%, 10.4%, 5.68%, and $3.125, respectively, With maturities of 2023, 2027, 2021, and 2019, respectively. Total long term debt stands at about $3.33 billion.

Is RLGY heading to wind down, or is the stock price actually cheap right now due to an over-reaction to recent operating fluctuation? 

How do you guys think about this company, and the stock?

More questions that come to mind. Is there something broken about the company that is not obvious, or is there something obvious that I'm missing? Are gross margins as a % susceptible to shrinkage, if so, to how much? Are brokers eager to leave RLGY for competition due to some cultural reason? What is the minimum maintenance operating expense needed to support the RLGY agent network? What can we learn about the real estate market when reading RLGY financials, and vice versa? At what price would a private buyer take over the company, or an activist investor buy its stock?

t3_bujuvn,Some ideas on valuation and the flaws of relying on it,"Hey everyone,

I just joined this sub after I was looking for a place I could get some feedback on some thoughts I've been developing about equity valuation.  This likely is all a bit jumbled, so I apologize in advance.  As a disclaimer, I'm likely wrong about some (if not all) of this, but I've been thinking about it for some time and can't find where I might be wrong.

Basically, I've been thinking lately about how analysts spend so much time building hyper-complex three-statement models, complete with revenue builds and an absurd number of line-items.  Now, these are absolutely useful in understanding a company's financial condition, margins, growth, etc, but are extremely unreliable when trying to determine what price to purchase a stock at.  There is far too much ambiguity.  If you, me, and ten others all built a model and DCF valuation for P&G, we would likely all come up with a different price target.

Plus, even if an analyst can perfectly project a company's financials and link it all into a FCF DCF, there is no guarantee the company's stock price will align with its calculated intrinsic value.  A stock price represents the consensus view of millions of individuals at a given point in time, and if they are all determining their opinion using different models and valuation methods, the stock's price won't line up precisely with the target of the one analyst who did it correctly.

So, since projecting a precise target is not an effective way to generate alpha, what is?  Well, many analysts rely on sell-side price targets for the trajectory of a stock, believing that, over time, a stock's price will roughly follow the trajectory of its earnings.  They think if a stock is trading at $50 and the Wall Street consensus target is $60, the stock will trend upwards.  In some sense this may be true if enough investors take action on the Wall Street recommendation. EDIT: I know investors seldom if ever take sell-side targets at face-value.  But, many cross-check their valuations against the sell-side ones, and there is a bias towards some degree of alignment with them.  Many amateur investors also take sell-side recommendations, as do many financial advisors.

I could go on longer in another post about why I think Wall Street recommendations should be taken with a New York-sized grain of salt, but I'll just give the executive summary of my current opinion: analysts have rarely been accurate with their price targets in the past.  Most use comp multiples in their valuations, which are a) extremely subjective to manipulation, which is problematic since analysts are incentivized to put out ""buy"" recommendations, and b) inherently ignore the state of the broader market (if the entire market or sector is overvalued, the comp multiple will be unjustifiably higher).  Plus, sell-side analysts do not have (to use Nassim Taleb's phrase) skin in the game with their recommendations - aka they do not have to put their money where their mouth is.

Many investors end up going deep into the weeds in building monster financial models for their valuations.  I'll admit it can be fun doing this as a sort of puzzle.  But, I believe that after a certain point the more complex the model, the less accurate.  There's a fascinating study about professional odds-makers for horse racing.  A group of them were asked to place odds on a race between 10 horses, and were told they could have any 4 pieces of data for comparing them (i.e. jockey weight, age, breed, etc).  They forecasted with 19% accuracy, which is not half bad.  They reported they felt about 10% confident (I may have the numbers slightly off) in their conclusions.  Then, they were asked to project another race, and this time were given more pieces of information.  After several iterations of this (up to something like 30 pieces of data), their accuracy had remained about constant, but their confidence had risen significantly despite the stagnation in accuracy.  So, complexity and extra information is not always as beneficial as one may intuitively think.

The main conclusion I've come to is that there must be a more simple way to value a stock that accounts for reality - meaning the actual behavior of the market - along with some degree of fundamentals instead of all one or the other.

For example, I've been considering this valuation technique:

* The historical harmonic average P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is 14.25 (monthly since 1928).  The average annual EPS growth over that time was 6.32%.  Both appear to revert to the mean over time.
   * Hence, this seems to be a better way to capture the average perception of the market: 6.32% earnings growth warrants a 14.25 P/E multiple
* So, a company with >6.32% growth should trade at a higher multiple, and one with lower growth at a lower multiple
* Then, you add an adjustment for risk.  A company with 6.32% growth but less risk (narrower distribution of possible outcomes) than the average company should trade at a higher multiple, and vice-versa.
* Finally, you add on a margin of safety (i.e. 5-10%) to compensate for unexpected events and forecasting error.

This method would only require calculating a growth rate.  This could be done with a simplified income P&L forecast sheet, and would be easy to run a sensitivity analysis on.

&#x200B;

The qualitative factors are, therefore, the most important piece of your analysis.  There have also been studies showing that people making decisions who have lots of quantitative data will overweight their decisions towards quantifiable indications while missing qualitative ones.  Buffet and Munger do not spend their time modeling out depreciation and CAPEX or equity issuances.  This is not to say these factors should be ignored, but there is an opportunity cost in spending too much time on them, and, according to what I've seen, decreasing marginal returns the deeper into the weeds you get.

I remember a speech where Munger was asked, ""What is the best investment advice you could give someone starting in the industry?""  He responded, ""Most people seem to think we use some magic formulas and complicated ideas to make decisions.  Back a few decades we just saw most cities had only one major newspaper, and some had two with one slowly dying.  So we bought all the good ones.  Does that seem like a complicated idea?""

t3_buczwr,JD.com accounting,"Dear all,
I am an investor in the company JD.com. One issue has bothered me for some time related to the company, and I would like if you could clear it up for me since I am not that proficient when it comes to accounting:
Each quarterly earnings report since JD Digits (what was previously JD Finance) was reconsolidated (starting with Q4, 2017) has noted that the receivables of JD Digits have an impact on JD's operating cash flow (CFO). These reports then present FCF and remove this impact on the CFO from the FCF. 

I don’t fully understand how, mechanically how this works. On the one hand, it makes sense to me that, since JD still absorbs the credit risk for the receivables of JD Digits, these should be removed from its cash flow. After all, if JD Digits was still consolidated, then the loans it made to people for purchasing JD products would be counted as cash outflow, while the cash that JD then received from these customers would be cash inflow. These would cancel each other out. So subtracting the positive effect these receivables have on CFO (as has been the case the last few quarters) allows us to see the true cash flow situation now that JD Digits is deconsolidated. 

However, once these receivables are actually received by JD Digits (i.e., paid off by the borrowers), then JD no longer absorbs the credit risk for them. So if these were subtracted from JD’s CFO (in calculating FCF), should they be added back to CFO once they are received?

I also have essentially the same question for what happens once the receivables are securitized and sold off to third parties (which JD describes in its most recent quarterly earnings 6K). Once this is done successfully, shouldn’t the amount sold off be added back?

Thanks for your help.

t3_bu99sc,Forecasting Working Capital Expenditures,"Hi - looking for input here. In a DCF it seems to be the norm for an analyst to slap a fixed % of sales in the WC line and call it a day. 

I know using % of sales makes the model more standardized, saves time, etc. but I'm doing a deep dive so don't care about that for sake of this example.


Thinking about what we're trying to solve for - I understand the line as our assumption of the absolute bare-bones expenses (inventory stocking, AP's, etc.) that a firm would need to keep the lights on. 

To come up with a projection I went through (example) company's history. If I take a simple delta of WC* year over year, I get a mix of positive and negative numbers as the accruals even out.

For the purposes of a DCF, the positive and negative fluctuations throw off this idea of an expense estimate. Does anyone have a better way to project WC? For example I thought about just taking the absolute values of past year/year changes. Thanks",21,0.9,1559098047.0

Due to the economic conditions they've wound down their DaBai Autos lending sector. Having said this, they've now dedicated 100% of their focus to growing their micro-lending business - in Q1 of 2019, the majority of their revenue growth came from off-balance sheet transactions, reflecting them shifting their business model from direct lending to lending intermediary (which addresses the regulatory crackdown concerns). They've forecasted revenue for FY 2019 to be at least RMB 3.5B; if we have some favourable exchange rates this should see their PE per ADS down to \~3!

&#x200B;

QD does not come without its risks though - if we dig carefully into their 20-F, we'll see that even though they're growing off-balance sheet transactions aggressively, they have guaranteed their institutional lending partners any defaults - this means they will pay the shortfall of defaulted loans that haven't been repaid (in-part or in-full), to their finance partners. Having said this, it looks like they're sensibly managing their delinquency rates at \~3-4% (and slightly decreasing).

&#x200B;

Should QD continue to exercise prudent management of delinquents, I believe they will soon mean revert back to a fair valuation, once the fears of regulation, trade war, China slow down, and etc. have blown over. As always though, DYOR, because this is definitely a higher risk but higher reward investment!",21,0.88,1559423949.0
t3_bvesdy,Chinese internet selloff and Weibo (Chinese Twitter)," There is an absolute slaughter-fest in China's stock market at the moment!   


A stock that has been hit extra hard is Weibo (WB:NASDAQ). Not only has it been sold off because of fears of the entire Chinese market slowing down, but after Baidu (BIDU) reported disappointing numbers, all internet stocks in China got immediately sold off the day following.  


Having said this, Weibo is a strong and healthy company growing at a \~20% clip. They have >500 million MAUs and >200 million DAUs. Popularly known as the Twitter of China, if we dig deeper, we'll realize that it's much much more; furthermore, >93% of their user base are mobile users - mobile digital ad spending in China is forecasted to grow exponentially - it'll also become the dominant form of digital advertising by 2020.

t3_c0i66t,Reading between the lines: What Slack didn’t disclose in its IPO filing," Slack Technologies, the developer of the popular namesake team collaboration messaging app, recently [applied](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8) for a public offering on the stock market. This is not a classic IPO, but a “direct listing,” also known a “direct public offering.” This means Slack is not raising money by directly selling shares and instead allows early investors and employees to sell their shares in the public offering. Music streaming service Spotify held a successful direct listing last year.

This story caught my attention for a simple reason. In August 2016, I joined the team developing a still-undercover product called Workplace by Facebook—a direct competitor to Slack. I worked on the product for 2.5 years. Back then, I dreamed of having an opportunity to look inside Slack’s business metrics.

It may seem that Slack has revealed a lot of data about the business in their [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8), a document that is almost 200 pages in length.

The reality is, they haven’t. The company had already disclosed in various ways much of the information compiled in their report.

But if we combine the data disclosed in S-1 filing and the experience I gained while working on Slack’s competitor, we’ll be able to uncover interesting details that will paint a more holistic picture.

I must say that this article contains my personal thoughts on the matter, jotted down while going through their S-1 filing, and should not be considered as investment advice.

## Slack’s top-level business metrics

* Slack doubles its revenue every year: $105.1M, $220.5M, $400.5M (respectively from 2016, 2017, 2019).
* Gross margin remains at the level of 87-88%. This doesn’t sound bad at all, although it isn’t unexpected from a fully digital product that costs several times more than its direct competitors.
* There is a lot of talk in the press about Slack’s unprofitability; the company shows a net loss of about $140M per year. But if we take a look at the cost structure and growth drivers (we’ll get to this later), then the losses won’t look like a problem. You can read more about this [here](https://tomtunguz.com/slack-s-1-analysis/).
* Slack estimates the market opportunity of workplace business technology software communication platforms at $28B per year. My own evaluation of the market stands at about the same number.
* Slack’s S-1 reminds us of the true costs of venture capital. The founders are left with 8.6% and 3.4% of the company. Meanwhile, the biggest shareholders are VC firms Accel Partners (24%), Andreessen Horowitz (13.3%), and Softbank (7.3%).

## Number of free and paid Slack customers

* Approximately 588,000 organizations use Slack.
* However, the concept of “organization” is rather vague in the report: “We define an organization on Slack as a separate entity, such as a company, educational or government institution, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a subscription plan, whether free or paid. Once an organization has three or more users on a paid subscription plan, we count them as a Paid Customer.” So, if there are 15 IBM teams using Slack, does it count as one organization or 15? It’s not clear.
* 88,000 of these organizations are paid customers, and over 500,000 organizations use Slack’s free subscription plan.
* Therefore, 15% of the active organizations are paying for the service. But this doesn’t give us a lot of information. Imagine 100 new companies register with Slack, but 99 of them stop using it after a while, and one remaining company purchases one of Slack’s paid plans. In this case we can say 100% of active companies are paid customers. But looking at it from a different perspective, only 1% of new companies become paid customers.
* My assessment of a long-term retention rate from a new organization into an active one for Slack is 5–10%. This is a very rough estimate. Moreover, long-term retention rates differ greatly depending on industry and acquisition channel.
* This estimation is based on my personal experience and the following quote from an old [interview](https://firstround.com/review/From-0-to-1B-Slacks-Founder-Shares-Their-Epic-Launch-Strategy/) with Slack’s founder: “Most people who fill out the form and hit submit — more than 90% — never invite anyone or start using the software.”
* If this estimation is correct, then 588,000 active organizations indicate that 5.5–11 million new organizations joined Slack over the service’s entire lifetime. This means that Slack gets about 115-230k new leads per month.
* If the estimate of the total number of organizations is correct, then the conversion rate from a new organization into a long-term paying customer stands at around 0.8-1.6%. If we factor in the average churn for SaaS (approx. 50%), then the conversion rate from a new organization signing up with Slack into the one that pays at least once will stand at around 1.5-3.5%.
* In many ways, Slack’s cleverness is hidden behind its strong brand and a huge flow of new organic leads. We will talk about it further on.

## Slack’s user engagement

* Slack’s DAU stays at around 10 million users (these are the users who either created or consumed content in the service at least once in 24 hours). The dynamics of DAU looks impressive.
* Slack had previously revealed its overall DAU and DAU of its paying users. But in the S-1 filing, it only mentions the overall DAU. This might signal that the growth of paying users has slowed down. Overall revenue growth is being pulled out by raising prices through the introduction of new tariffs and Slack for Enterprise taking a greater share of the revenue of the service.
* More than 1 billion messages are sent via Slack every week. This means that the average active user sends 14 messages per day. This is a good level of user engagement, but it’s not extraordinary or impressive.
* An average active user spends 42 minutes per day in the service. In comparison, active paid users spend an average 90 minutes in Slack per working day. These numbers don’t look bad. But when compared to the average 14 messages sent per user, they look dubious.
* The big question is, how does Slack calculate time spent in the product? A few years ago, they simply looked at the time the service was active on users’ devices. That has changed, but the company mentions no specific methodology in their filing, which makes it difficult to interpret the numbers.

## Slack’s business model

Even without a report, Slack’s business model seems obvious, but the company laid it out eloquently in the filing:

“We offer a self-service approach, for both free and paid subscriptions to Slack, which capitalizes on strong word-of-mouth adoption and customer love for our brand. Since 2016, we have augmented our approach with a direct sales force and customer success professionals who are focused on driving successful adoption and expansion within organizations, whether on a free or paid subscription plan.”

Here are the key points:

* Slack gets most new customers organically through word-of-mouth(self-serve model).
* Some of the new organizations convert into paying customers.
* The sales team works with leads that qualify as large organizations.
* The goal of the sales team is to increase Slack’s penetration within large organizations.

Let us now reflect on some of these points in more detail.

## The top of Slack’s funnel is driven by organic signups from word-of-mouth

“We offer a self-service approach, for both free and paid subscriptions to Slack, which capitalizes on strong word-of-mouth adoption and customer love for our brand.”

The first question that occurs after reading this sentence is, why doesn’t Slack accelerate growth by investing in acquisition through paid ad channels? It isn’t hard to verify that Slack almost doesn’t invest in Google Ads or Facebook Ads (there are some paid ads, but they’re mostly focused on branded search).

Here’s the short answer: The SMB (small and medium-sized business) segment’s economics doesn’t justify paying for ads because the return on investment is negative (ROI < 0). Meanwhile, direct advertising channels don’t work for the enterprise segment. 

Now here’s a more detailed answer:

* The average cheque for Slack’s paying customers is $380 per month.
* If we ignore companies that Slack considers as enterprise customers (with more than $100k ARR), then the average cheque per month will be $230, and the average organization’s size will be 40 people.
* Thus, a self-serve client brings \~$2,760 in revenue in the first year and \~$2,400 in gross profit in the first year.
* If the goal is to get a positive return on investment (ROI) within 12 months, then, then a long-term paying client should cost $2,400 in the self-serve segment.
* With a 0.8-1.6% conversion rate into a long-term paying customer, a new organization should cost $20-40.
* But in B2B, leads from organic channels usually demonstrate 2-4 times better metrics than the leads from paid advertising channels. Let’s assume that in the case of Slack, the difference is 2x. This means in order to get ROI > 0, Slack needs to acquire new organizations at a cost of $10-20.
* This looks unrealistic if we consider the economics of paid advertising channels in developed markets, where the average cost of a new organization from Google Ads or Facebook Ads will be around $100-200.
* That’s why Slack invests nearly nothing in paid acquisition. It grows mainly through strong brand, word-of-mouth, integrations with other services and the subsequent cross-promos, the professional communities in Slack and tools for communication between companies.

On the one hand, Slack is shielded from competitors because it has a huge number of organic leads and due to the fact that paid acquisition doesn’t work in the market, it is nearly impossible to get close to Slack in the self-serve segment.

On the other hand, as you will soon see, the self-serve segment acts as a gateway to reach enterprise customers. But Slack’s competitors have other ways to reach these companies.

## Net Dollar Retention Rate is the most interesting piece of data Slack revealed

The following chart shows the growth of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) by cohorts based on the year when organizations first paid for using Slack.

ARR from organizations that first paid for Slack in 2015 continues to grow steadily in the following years.

For most products, cohorts shrink as they age. But in Slack’s case, we’re witnessing the opposite (this is also called Negative Revenue Churn). This is one of the main reasons why Slack is worth so much ($7B valuation at the latest funding round, $10B proposed valuation for the public offering).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvfzpl7vla431.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=3634cf8ede9a4f8fb1f0eb974752f5d10088d96e

However, it is worth noting that such growth patterns are typical for products in this kind of market. Zoom, which recently went public, has a Net Dollar Retention of 140%. Twilio and Atlassian showed even more impressive figures at the time of their IPO ([source](https://tomtunguz.com/slack-s-1-analysis/)).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gix4fovvla431.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f44393afabbccdbb49adf609015cc63f114f42d

The following are the main growth drivers:

* Expansion of the user base within companies that are already using the service: Slack is building up their sales team, which reaches out to companies that have already started using Slack, and does everything to get the remaining employees to switch to the service.
* The organic growth of customers: Companies that have started using Slack are hiring new employees and growing in size. More employees -> more Slack users -> Slack gets more money.
* Price changes: Slack raises prices directly or by introducing new tariff plans.

An interesting consequence here is that Slack’s growth depends more on how the team is developing the product and the growth of its current customers than on attracting new users and converting them into paying ones.

Acquisition, of course, is just as much important, but it has a rather delayed impact on the overall revenue growth.

Another consequence is that such growth mechanism depends greatly on having enough enterprise customers with many employees who have not yet started using Slack (it will be difficult to grow revenue from of old cohorts if all of them are SMBs with 40 employees).

If you look at the growth of new paying customers, it doesn’t look promising. Slack added 22,000 paying customers in 2017 and 29,000 in 2018. This is a 30% increase in new paying clients, but still not the kind of dynamics Slack would like to see.

Therefore, the main driver of Slack’s exponential revenue growth is the expansion of cash flow from its old customers.

Slack measures this process using the Net Dollar Retention Rate metric: They take all the customers who were already paying 12 months ago. They then divide the current MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) by the MRR for the previous 12 months.

Net Dollar Retention Rate for the last three years looks like this: 171%, 152%, 143%. That is, customers who paid a year ago pay much more in the following year. Which is fantastic. Net Dollar Retention Rate is gradually decreasing, but this is expectable due to the slowdown of growth in old cohorts.

Here’s what Slack’s report says about this:

“We disclose Net Dollar Retention Rate as a supplemental measure of our organic revenue growth. We believe Net Dollar Retention Rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain, and grow revenue from, our Paid Customers.

We calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the MRR from all Paid Customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or Prior Period MRR. We then calculate the MRR from these same Paid Customers as of the current period end, or Current Period MRR. Current Period MRR includes expansion within Paid Customers and is net of contraction or attrition over the trailing twelve months, but excludes revenue from new Paid Customers in the current period, including those organizations that were only on Free subscription plans in the prior period and converted to paid subscription plans during the current period. We then divide the total Current Period MRR by the total Prior Period MRR to arrive at our Net Dollar Retention Rate.”

## Enterprise is a problematic segment for Slack

If you have enough patience to go through the entire 200-page report, you will notice Slack repeatedly showcasing its success in the enterprise segment. This segment accounts for a significant part of the market ($28 billion spent on communication tools each year), and this is what Slack is striving for. This is the where their long-term growth lies and where they are getting Net dollar retention rate > 100%.

Here’s what the report says about this segment:

* Customers should have ARR > 100k to be considered enterprise customers.
* The number of enterprise clients in the past three years: 135, 298, 575
* The revenue share of the Enterprise segment in the past three years: 22%, 32%, 40%
* Revenue from enterprise customers over the past three years: $23M, $70.5M, $160.2M
* Average monthly spending by enterprise customers in the past three years: $14,200, $19,700, $23,200
* The largest customers have “tens of thousands of employees” or tens of thousands of active users per day—quite an ambiguous wording (“our largest Paid Customers have tens of thousands of employees using Slack on a daily basis”).
* For the last two years, almost all of the Slack product releases have been aimed at adapting the product to large organizations. Take for example Slack Enterprise Grid, adding Threads, Unread section.

At first glance, it does look impressive. But let’s take a closer look.

* Customers should have ARR > 100k to be considered enterprise customers. This means that organizations with over 1,000 employees using Slack fall into the enterprise segment. This is a rather low threshold. I assume it was chosen to get a larger absolute value of enterprise customers.
* Even with such a low threshold, Slack only has 575 enterprise clients. It is not much. Even Facebook Workplace, which entered the market much later (and doesn’t have such a phenomenal influx of organic leads), announced three months ago that it has 150 companies with more than 10,000 employees on the platform ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/facebook-says-that-workplace-now-has-2m-paying-users/)). And Teams, Microsoft’s Slack competitor, which launched even later than Workplace, has also achieved similar figures ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/teams-microsofts-slack-competitor-says-its-signed-up-over-500k-organizations-adds-whiteboard-and-live-events-support/)).
* Another way to look at 575 Enterprise customers is to compare it to the total number of organizations that have created a Slack workspace (5.5 – 11 million). Only 0.01% of them achieve enterprise status. Slack is very skewed towards the SMB segment, which suffers from a high churn rate and has very little potential for expanding revenue from its old customers.
* Major customers have tens of thousands of employees. It sounds impressive, but those who have worked with products focused on the enterprise segment know that there are many companies in the world with hundreds of thousands—and even millions—of employees (and usually they are outside the technology sector). A few examples of Facebook Workplace’s customers are Walmart, with 2.2 million employees, Starbucks with 250,000 employees, and Telenor with 37,000 employees ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/workplace-facebooks-enterprise-edition-snaps-up-walmart-as-a-customer/)). In terms of revenue, onboarding Walmart equates to signing up thousands of companies with 1,000 employees. This is not an attempt to say that Workplace rocks, but rather to mention that Slack finds it difficult to strike big deals.
* For the last two years, almost all of Slack’s product releases have been aimed at adapting the service to large organizations. This is true, but Slack doesn’t do it for fun. Slack loses most of its deals to competitors when trying to sign up enterprise clients, because the service works poorly for companies with over 500 employees, and even worse for companies scattered across different time zones. Synchronous communication, which is Slack’s forte, starts to falter under such conditions.
* And now regarding the blind spots that Slack was silent about in the report. The report has no clear breakdown of Slack’s customers by industry. This is an important question, since Slack initially grew in the IT and media segments. And it is unclear whether they managed to step beyond these limits, and how the product performs in more classical verticals (e.g. banking, retail, insurance, etc.). If Slack experiences problems there (as it previously has), then the market of $28B will be dramatically narrowed down to the niche of the technology business, which isn’t very impressive.

And here’s where things get really problematic for Slack:

* Microsoft already has access to a lot of large enterprise clients from all verticals and has been selling them products bundled in a single package for a long time. They recently added Microsoft Teams to the Office Suite, which is just as good as Slack in terms of functionality. Does Slack offer enough incentive to convince enterprise customers to forgo the benefits of their long-term relationship with Microsoft?
* Workplace by Facebook was originally designed for large organizations and outperforms Slack product-wise in this market segment. Moreover, Workplace works great outside the technology sector too because the product’s interface is very familiar to the masses, which means companies save a lot of money and time since they don’t need to do any employee training.

In the next 5-7 years (indeed, B2B and especially the enterprise sector are slow-paced markets with one of the longest transaction cycles) it will be thrilling to see how Slack responds to these threats and challenges.

## Summing it up

* Well done for Slack. They won over the self-serve market segment and no one even comes close to them.
* Just as much as Slack enjoys its growth in the self-serve segment, they make the best out of it using it as a source of enterprise leads for the sales team, which then spreads Slack inside large corporations.
* Slack is growing rapidly and will continue to do so in the next few years (mostly due to the expansion of revenue coming from the old cohorts). However, what happens next is still a big question.
* Slack’s long-term growth depends on how much of the enterprise segment they’ll be able to conquer, and whether they’ll be able (or perhaps they already have – this is not clear from the report) to expand beyond the segment of tech companies.

t3_c0i0jw,Graftech Follow Up Analysis - In Response to MarketPlunger,"This video is my follow up analysis and response to MarketPlunger's initial analysis (with his permission). The original analysis is below:

&#x200B;

[https://themarketplunger.com/2019/02/27/graftech-eaf-a-fallen-ipo-generating-hefty-fcf-through-long-term-contracted-revenues-thats-spewing-cash-to-shareholders/](https://themarketplunger.com/2019/02/27/graftech-eaf-a-fallen-ipo-generating-hefty-fcf-through-long-term-contracted-revenues-thats-spewing-cash-to-shareholders/) 

&#x200B;

In his thesis, he thoroughly details the bullish case, and why Graftech is in a far better position compared to any of their competitors e.g.: HEG India, Graphite India, Showa Danko, and Tokai Carbon.  I agree with his bull case.

&#x200B;

In the comments, he mentioned he'd like a further deep dive into the bear case, hence the majority of my video analysis will be based on the bear case: the first \~1/3 of my video will be recapping the bull case, and the latter 2/3 will focus on the bear case. **The bear thesis starts around 10:35 of my video:**

&#x200B;

[https://youtu.be/I8S0qPEYaU0](https://youtu.be/I8S0qPEYaU0)

&#x200B;

**In summation, I'm not too concerned by the bear case because:**

&#x200B;

\- based on my analysis, Chinese undercutting is technologically behind - by at least 3 - 4 years - the quality disparity between Graftech's electrodes (and other established producers) and Chinese imitations is large

\- petcoke quality directly influences electrode quality

\- high powered UHP electrodes are <600mm - China only just made a breakthrough for 700mm electrodes in 2018, and have just started heavily investing into capabilities to manufacture 600 - 650mm 

\- Petcoke is used for more than just electrodes e.g.: cement and the production of anodes for electric vehicles

\- China's EV industry is growing faster than the steel industry - I think this will further exacerbate petcoke undersupply vs. oversupply

&#x200B;

**Final notes:**

&#x200B;

Based on my research, it looks like Brookfield has completed the sell down of their parcel of around \~3-5% of their holdings. They still currently hold around 70 - 75% of the outstanding shares, but I was unable to find any evidence stating they're looking to further sell down - this could change, but I suspect because of EAF's current depressed valuation, this is unlikely.

  
My research shows the purpose of Brookfield taking Graftech back public was because of the massive spike in spot Electrode prices, as they were the ones who acquired Graftech and took them private back in 2015.

&#x200B;

**Investment strategy:**

&#x200B;

Whilst there is overwhelming evidence that Graftech is undervalued, I'm not a petrochemical engineer, hence could be completely wrong about debunking the bear case, hence will limit portfolio exposure to about 2% in EAF.",7,1.0,1560504056.0

3. Don't you pay the creditor the full $50, so how is there a tax benefit?

t3_c5uuct,"Cost of capital - specifically cost of equity : vital, but impossible to calculate?","Hey all,

&#x200B;

I've been thinking lately about how so much of finance is predicated on the discounting of cash flows at a discount rate to determine the value of something (a security/project/etc) in today's dollars.  This is fairly do-able with fixed income instruments, but equities is a completely different story.

Every finance program I've seen teaches CAPM as one of the fundamental building blocks of stock valuation, along with WACC.  We all know the formulas: Er = rf + B ( Erm - rf) ; WACC = We(Ke) + Wd(Kd)(1-t)

&#x200B;

Given tiny fluctuations in the discount rate can significantly alter the result of a DCF calculation, effectively estimating Ke is very important.  The method we are given (and which until recently I took for granted) is CAPM, which takes the risk free rate, adds an equity risk premium to adjust the required return for the added risk of investing in equities instead of government debt, and then adjusts that term for firm-specific risk, quantified by beta.

&#x200B;

While building a valuation a couple months ago, I realized how much I could alter the output by simply calculating my Beta differently.  Regressing daily prices against the S&P 500 over a three year time horizon and monthly prices over the same horizon yielded significantly different results, as did changing the time horizon to five or one year.  Enough of a difference to shift the output from indicating 10% downside to 10% upside.

This got me thinking - why does Beta make any sense as a measurement of risk?  All it calculates is the covariance of the stock's returns and the market's, which is a measurement of volatility.  But, volatility shouldn't measure risk.  If I buy a stock today for $10 and sell it in five years for $30, it doesn't matter if the price was highly volatile or extremely stable over that time-frame.  Investment returns are vector, not scalar, meaning they are not path dependent.  Risk should be measured by the probabilities of realizing different possible returns over different time frames.  Beta does not measure this.

Calculating the expected return on the market is also difficult, and can be done in many different methods that yield results different enough to swing the output of a model.

&#x200B;

So, what I'd be curios to hear from you all is if anyone can think of a better way to estimate Ke.  Or, if I'm missing something here with CAPM (which is very possible, especially if there is a mathematical nuance of covariances I'm not understanding), I'd love to hear what it is.  I've seen enough credible people (Nassim Taleb in particular) criticize the use of CAPM, so I am semi-confident I'm not crazy.

I'm thinking there could be a way to use a Monte-Carlo simulation to develop a sense of what the cost of equity should be.  Maybe there is a way to quantify firm-specific risk based on capital intensity, operational/margin sensitivity, ROIC, etc.  Or, maybe the best way is to use a constant number and then use a sensitivity analysis to get a feel for the valuation range of a DCF at different Ke's.

Looking forward to hearing all your thoughts!

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm also aware that many (if not most) professionals do not use CAPM in practice, but I have yet to see a highly concrete calculation method.  I more am trying to stimulate a conversation about what Ke represents and how to translate the theory into an actual calculation.",61,0.94,1561578822.0

t3_c6ovln,Let's have a conversation about HealthEquity(HQY),"**Edit/Follow-up to comments:**


&nbsp;


Thanks for the thoughts everyone. Two main criticisms:

 
&nbsp;


*1) Lack of Competitive Advantage*

So this is probably the biggest hangup with this stock. I get people's anecdotal complaints about customer service, but realize all of these HSA providers have anecdotal experiences like these... all of them... The facts are that HQY has sustained HSA additions faster than their second and third largest competitor combined, and that HSA customers have proven to be exceptionally sticky. Another factor that was unmentioned RE: growth concerns is their revenue is tied to AuM, which not only grows from # of accounts under administration, but cash balances within the accounts, which only continue to grow year after year. It's also tied to prevailing interest rates, which not only serves somewhat as a hedge, but is arguably a secular boon given what 50-year historical rate curves look like. In addition, net income growth % will meaningfully outpace revenue/HSA additions as cash margins skyrocket and $ is plowed back into the business. From my perspective, it's hard to argue that customer complaints will hinder a 5-year compound 50%+ net income growth sufficiently to drop <25% given the overwhelming positives. To own this stock, you don't need any sort of catalyst or re-rating, you're actually betting on anything better than a de-rating and fairly pessimistic status-quo.

 

&nbsp;


/u/galt325 made very important comments regarding competitive dynamic as well (enterprise decision, complicated nature of business, bigger institutions exiting biz) that argue against the importance of customer experience/fee (although these are important and I do believe HQY mgmt is privy to these factors!). RE: betting on other, cheaper competitors to ride the HSA trend, I would much rather go with the pure-play dominating the landscape. As mentioned, the magnitude of potential FCF generation is disconnected with the current price of the stock.

 

&nbsp;


*2) Regulatory Risk*

Regulatory risk needs to be taken into account, but in my opinion there's not much more to be said. As far as healthcare legislation goes, bi-partisan support is a big deal and HSAs have that.

 
&nbsp;


Again thanks for the thoughts. Maybe I'll post another thesis soon.


&nbsp;


**Original post:**


&nbsp;



I personally would like to see more original discussion on individual stocks/businesses so let’s have a conversation about HealthEquity (HQY)!

&nbsp;


**Why?**

To my knowledge, there have been no adequately articulated bull theses anywhere on the internet (save seeking alpha BS), one short thesis on VIC, and one short for a competitor WAGE (which somewhat translates into a bull thesis for HQY) on VIC. Over the last year I have become very bullish on this stock and business and it is one of my top holdings. Their latest announcement to acquire WAGE re-affirms my confidence in the management team/future growth/capital allocation of the business and I can’t help but pound the table on this stock. This will be very verbose so feel free to jump around but I’d like to get a discussion going regardless.


&nbsp;


TLDR: HQY is the early-mid innings of what will be one of the best, most stable, highest-ROIC businesses in the world. At a 4B market capitalization it’s trading at a fraction of intrinsic value. I estimate a 5-year 20%+ IRR from purchasing the stock at its current ($65) price.


&nbsp;


**The Industry**

&nbsp;


*The Problem with US Healthcare and need for HSAs*

News flash: there’s a healthcare spending crisis in the US. From ~6% of GDP in 1965, national healthcare expenditures total ~18% of GDP today and are projected to continue to eat more of the GDP pie. Healthcare quality has not improved proportionally. You could point to a multitude of causes but many congressmen/healthcare experts highlight the arcane, esoteric cost structure of the industry. Now there are 1,000 page volumes on why this is/how it works but long story short a major flaw is **lack of agency on the part of Healthcare consumers** (see [Consumer-driven healthcare]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer-driven_healthcare)). I’ll give an abridged version of this phenomenon. Identical healthcare procedures can fluctuate in cost 100-600%, with the same level of quality. I.e. if I’m getting a colonoscopy you can quote it out to 5 different places and receive prices **for virtually the same operation** for $800-$5000 (these are real numbers, svc charges include differing prep kits, diagnoses, sedation techniques, pathology, facility etc). The way many insurance policies are structured disincentivize consumers from shopping healthcare costs and actually making a price/quality decision, causing costs to balloon and providers/insurance co’s to make out like bandits (just look at ROIC of *those* businesses). So, there has been a big push to put cost/healthcare decisions back in the hands of consumers and make them more responsible for their healthcare choices.


&nbsp;


*How does an HSA help?*

Enter Health Savings Accounts (HSA). An HSA is a savings account offering triple tax-deductibility (tax-free contribution, growth, and withdrawal) for qualified medical expenses. HSAs and similar devices enable consumers to pay routine medical expenses/save for future costs while falling back on a High-Deductible Health Plan for large expenses. So now when I go and shop around for that operation, I’m going to have costs in mind (as the balance will fall into my pocket) and the idea is this should help control costs in the long-run for the country. HSAs were created in 2003 and grew rapidly to 4.5m accounts in 2007, 9m in 2013, and 25m in 2018. The rise in popularity of HSA/HDHP and similar plans demonstrate the efficacy/potential of this model. Arguably there is a secular shift which will increase the portion of ~190M under-age 65 consumers to adopt the HSA/HDHP or similar model.


&nbsp;


**The Business**


&nbsp;


*Overview*

HQY is a mission-driven first-mover and innovator/pioneer of the industry itself, with founder/CEO dynamics, offering HSAs coupled with health plans since 2005. Stephen Neeleman (VP/Founder, prior CEO) is an HSA expert and aggressively lobbies for HQY/HSAs in congress. Jon Kessler (CEO) previously founded WageWorks (NYSE: WAGE) a $2B company which offers competing products. It’s interesting that Kessler left WAGE (which focuses on inferior FSAs, being cannibalized by HSAs) to lead HQY and now is essentially pulling a Steve Jobs and acquiring his old company (more on that later). To say HQY is dominating this industry is an understatement. They have sustained growth for years higher than their second and third largest competitors combined. It’s a combination of astute management, industry know-how, aggressive marketing/sales/account tactics, strong company culture, and exceptional customer service. 


&nbsp;


*Competitive Advantage / “Moat”*

Other HSA Plan Providers: HSA Authority; Fifth Third, Optum, UMB Bank, BenefitWallet, HSA Bank, Further, HealthSavings Administrators, Bank of America


&nbsp;


As already stated HQY is dominating the competition. The fact that their fees charged are more-or-less in the middle of the pack demonstrate that **lower fee is not what drives the competitive dynamic**. Administrators can differentiate based on investment options offered, quality of those investment options, transparency of service/options, customer-service, robustness of technological platform, eligibility/compatibility with investment managers/health plans, ability of the admin to sell into company plans, etc. Long-story short… it’s not simply a race to the bottom on fees (ala retirement/trading accounts, which bears have pointed to). It’s much more complicated and based on a multitude of complex dynamics/relationships that lie at the center of the byzantine American healthcare system. HQY’s business provides: 

&nbsp;


1)	A liaison between consumers, healthcare plans (employers, etc), healthcare providers, investment managers, us govt (to continue to lobby new plans/savings vehicles)


2)	A robust technological platform integrating saving/spending decisions, healthcare bills, cost comparison, investment comparison, benefit information, wellness incentives


3)	Education and transparency to all parties, especially consumers


&nbsp;


Additionally, HQY is one of the few (and only major) competitors that made the business decision to solely focus on HSAs. In addition, as much of this business is network-based, there are inherent scale/network-effect benefits. It’s not an industry with a low barrier to entry and speaks to the large gap between HQY and the competition.


&nbsp;


*Revenue*

HQY had 3.5M accounts on their platform as of FY ’18, adding ~700K accounts each year since 2016. HQY generates revenue via

1)	Custodial: cash assets deposited with custodial bank partners/annuities with insurance partners (48%)

2)	Service: fees charged for monthly account services (31%)


3)	Interchange: fees charged on physical/virtual payment cards (21%)

Note the vast majority of revenue growth is coming from Custodial segment – tied to what is basically the “AuM” of the business/prevailing rates, and the long-term business strategy is to reduce other fees as a benefit to the consumer. As these three revenue sources are virtually disconnected from any consumer supply/demand dynamics, management has highlighted the unusual amount of stability/foreseeability (“90% visibility”) in all three sources. 


&nbsp;


*WAGE acquisition*

So as I’ll highlight in the next section HQY is a cash machine. They have sustained 100%+ ROIC and have just stockpiled cash/investments on the B/S with virtually no liabilities. So a huge question is capital allocation… and the newly announced WAGE acquisition reaffirms my confidence in that department. The acquisition will consist of total cash outlays of ~2.3B, funded by ~600M of cash and ~1.7B of new debt. They plan to rapidly deleverage with the high, stable, cash flow of the combined businesses. I’m not going to go into the details on WAGE’s business model, please see VIC short idea post for that, it’s a great writeup. Long-story short their margins are inferior, their products are inferior, and HQY is cannibalizing their business. The general idea is to convert a large portion of WAGE’s customers to the better-serving, fiscally constructive HSA/HDHP model. 


&nbsp;


**The Numbers**


&nbsp;


*Metric Definitions*

Cash Flow: OCF – Special Items – Maintenance Capex/Dev Costs

Net Liquid Assets: Short-Term/Long-Term Liquid Assets(Cash/Investments) – All Liabilities [included to show how HQY just stockpiles cash]

ROIC: Cash Flow / Operating Assets (Assets less mainly intangibles and cash)


&nbsp;


*HQY Financials ($mn)*

Year|Revenue|Cash Flow|Cash Margin|Net Liquid Assets|Operating Assets|ROIC
:--|:-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:
2013|46|11|24%|NA|NA|NA
2014|62|13|21%|-7|12|108%
2015|88|15|17%|96|17|88%
2016|127|26|20%|107|25|104%
2017|178|45|25%|163|29|155%
2018|230|81|35%|218|41|198%

2019 HQY cash flow (40% growth assumed, vs 80% last year) = (FY2018 CF) 81 * 1.4 = 113

2019 WAGE cash flow (15% contraction assumed) = (FY2018 CF) 127 * .85 = 108

2019 PF Combined cash flow = 221

2019 PF Combined Net Income =  67*1.4 (HQY) + 26*.85 (WAGE) = 116

(Tentative) Interest Expense = 3.5% (Libor + 120 bps) * 1.7B = 60

&nbsp;


The cash margins speak to the scalability here… their incremental margins is in the range of 70%+. They’ve compounded net income growth at 50%+ since their IPO. Anyone who has studied ROIC of businesses will immediately recognize how ridiculously lucrative this franchise is. You can argue against those adjustments (intangibles/cash) but it’s perfectly sound practice on the street/many shops. It’s a cash machine. Also realize there’s a thousand ways to calculate all these metrics but don’t get bogged down to lose the big picture here…


&nbsp;


**Risks/Bears**

The way I see it risk could be bucketed into three major categories which I will briefly address (and maybe leave some to you guys!) Note there is **a lot** I did not cover about this stock, leaving the nitty-gritty for Q&A:


&nbsp;


*1) Regulatory Risk*

It goes without saying, one stroke of a pen in congress can destroy most US healthcare businesses. It’s always a risk in this industry. HSAs have always had bi-partisan support and I personally believe cooler heads will prevail. Spiraling healthcare costs are one of the hottest issues the US faces and I think responsible decision-makers know CDHP is a solution not a cause of the problems.


&nbsp;


*2) Competition*


I have touched on this briefly in the writeup above.


&nbsp;


*3) Valuation*

Many investors get scared off by a 40x+ P/E valuation but you miss a lot of great investment opportunities with this mindset. I also go back to this quote from Buffett:

&nbsp;


> “The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to. Because then you feel so strongly about the product”


&nbsp;


**The Bottom Line**

So you’re looking at a business with a strong “moat”, high ROIC, reinvestment opportunity, recurring revenue, low churn, strong mgmt., industry-leader, that has sustained net income/cash flow growth of 50%+ trading at ~20x cash flow and ~40x net income. **Those multiples assume no synergies whatsoever on revenue/cost from the acquisition, which really are inevitable**. I predict HQY will manage to sustain net income growth of 25%+ over the next five years, and pay down a significant portion of the debt resulting in a net income figure of ~350mn, a ~10B market capitalization with a 30x P/E multiple, justifiable given the robustness of the business. At the current share price of $65, a 5-year holding period would generate an IRR of 20%.",25,0.93,1561751948.0

t3_c8eonj,Afterpay Will Continue To Outperform (Updated),"Hey guys, this is a re-post as Beren wanted me to do a longer write up (full video analysis at end of post):

&#x200B;

For those of you who aren't familiar with Afterpay (APT:ASX), they are an Australian founded BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) provider.

&#x200B;

Since their inception 3 years ago, they've captured over 16% of Australia's addressable retail market, and have recently launched in the USA and UK. In their short time there, they've already captured the attention of some major retail brands, and are signing up approximately 10,000 new users per week (on their app).

&#x200B;

A week ago, VISA came out with an announcement that it intends to partner with its network to provide BNPL, and the APT share price fell off a cliff. However, the market has overreacted because Mastercard tried to do this in:

&#x200B;

2016 - failed

2018 (AMEX tried it too) - failed yet again

&#x200B;

The problem these companies face is that 2/3 of millennials don't own or want to own a credit card. Furthermore, APT works like a recruitment company, whereby the user e.g.: candidate gets a premium experience for free. As long as their users don't default, they are charged no fees or interest for being able to split their purchase into several installments - often, this is enough to tip a potential buy over the line, to make a purchase decision. Should they default, their accounts are suspended permanently - APT do not offer evergreen BNPL.

In my video, I deep dive into stats detailing why millennials are more likely to purchase (online and offline) if there are some ""instant gratification"" incentives - 40 - 45% (buy and buy more), and 75% when it comes to e-commerce. I also deep dive into conclusive stats based on web traffic interest, backlinks, mobile and desktop user trends, and etc.

t3_ca8kme,SMSI: An under covered microcap software company,"Writeup on Smith Micro Software. Feedback/input is welcome.

# Description

SMSI is a mobile application developer who sells to  carriers, which in turn sells to their subscribers. Similar to how Sprint bundles Hulu with their phone plans to end customers. I believe  SMSI is worth significantly more than it’s current valuation and the market have not priced in the following key developments:

**Main thesis:**

1. SMSI shifting revenue from low margin graphics business to high margin  mobile app business. Company grew gross margins from mid-70s in 2017 to  91% in 1Q19
2. Revenue and profit expected to increase QoQ over the  next 2 years. Revenue expected to grow from 23M in 2017 to 38M  (estimated) in FY19
3. Expected new partnerships with other carriers  in 2019, as guided by management across several major product lines.  Stock tripled when SMSI signed Sprint in late 2017.

SMSI  recently turned the corner and became profitable in FY18. I expect they  will continue to grow meaningfully while generating positive cash flow  QoQ.

It’s hard to run into an opportunity as compelling as SMSI.  Below I’ll provide a very brief background on SMSI and cover their  margins, growth and upcoming opportunities for the company and  shareholders. I believe the business will grow to be x3 – x5 it’s  current market cap of $100M over the next two years.

# SMSI: A brief overview

**SMSI Financial Profile:**

&#x200B;

The company is currently valuated at 100M, has zero debt, and $7.5M in cash at time of this writing.

https://preview.redd.it/rj8ibiu5ow831.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=858c66390a9b88a5f24109ffc039c5e8d290d8c2

&#x200B;

\*GAAP EPS. Non-GAAP EPS is generally 2c higher which excludes amortization and stock based compensation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Smith Micro Software is a mobile application developer with three main applications product lines:

&#x200B;

* \-SafePath: Essentially a location, family and parental control app.  Although they are growing the product line to expend into smart homes  (SafePath Home), and IoT devices (SafePath IoT).
* CommSuite: A  visual voice message app with integrations to Alexa and other smart  home devices. This product line up is also extending, although I’ll skip  the intro due the fact that the expansions are still being launched  with minimal revenue at this point.
* ViewSpot: An application  installed on a device in retail stores (think BestBuy, AT&T stores)  to provide guided tours for retail customers. These ‘guided tours’  control what shoppers see and how they interact with a device. AT&T  and Verizon are SMSI’s biggest customers for this product.

*The  company also has a legacy graphics business. This is a profitable  business but has negligible revenue contributions so I’ll skip the  intro. It contributes roughly $1M/year in revenue.*

&#x200B;

For more information, I recommend going to smithmicro.com to read more each of SMSI’s 3 main software products.

&#x200B;

For the purpose of this write-up I’ll focus on the business itself.

# Overview of Smith Micro’s Sales Process:

SMSI’s  has a deep sales relationship with all the Tier 1 and many Tier 2/3  carriers & MSOs in the US. Unlike most application developers who  releases their apps directly to consumers, SMSI white labels their  products to carriers and MSOs. Carriers & MSOs then rebrand SMSI’s  products as their own, and sells these apps their own retail customers.  Here’s a brief overview on how SMSI release their products to consumers:

&#x200B;

1. SMSI sign a revenue share agreement with a carrier, which has historically been around a 50/50 revenue split
2. Carrier pre-installs SMSI’s apps on their phones to be sold to retail customers
3. When retail customers purchase a phone from a carrier, the carrier have  the opportunity to upsell SMSI app subscriptions to these retail  customers, similar to how BestBuy upsell customers on insurance when you  buy a dishwasher
4. If retail customers purchases the subscription,  they are billed an extra few dollars per month, resulting in 100%  margins for carriers, and 91% gross margins for SMSI
5. If retail  customers declines the subscription, they have the opportunity to use  SMSI’s free-tier apps and subscribe to the premium version at a later  time

&#x200B;

This is a beautiful business model because:

\-	 Carriers receive 100% margins of these sales, while offering their  retail customers additional value provided by SMSI’s apps. Customers are  less likely to leave a carrier when they have multiple service  offerings with a single carrier (stickiness)-	SMSI receives high margin revenue with zero to no marketing expense

&#x200B;

For SMSI to grow, they need to:

1. Sign more carriers / MSOs, or
2. Grow their existing partnerships

&#x200B;

As we’ll discuss below, SMSI is currently growing on both fronts.

# Catalysts - why now

SMSI’s recently turned the  corner and became Non-GAAP profitable in FY18 (adjusting for outstanding  warrants), with positive cash flow expected in the next 2-3 years.  SMSI’s key growth areas is detailed below as well as their recent growth  rates and forecasted 2019, 2020 growth rates. Most of this is fairly  simple to model out given the recurring nature of their revenue.

**1. Growing existing partnerships**

&#x200B;

SMSI signed and begun ramping up Sprint for their SafePath application in 2018. This single relationship has grown from $200k in 1Q18 to $2,100k in 1Q19 revenue. Management has also guided towards continued growth in 2019.

Below we show SMSI’s 3 key applications and their current and expected growth for 2019, and 2020.

I’ve included 2018 and 1Q19 (actuals) revenue for reference.

https://preview.redd.it/dpjuqsldow831.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1ea07413084a9f636660cc7ac41903e63b8339b

&#x200B;

A few assumptions:

1. I assume conservative growth of 100k/Q for CommSuite, based on CC guidance and 1 on 1 calls with management
2. I assume a growth rate of 30% for Q2 for Safepath, an 400k/Q thereafter. The 30% growth comes from guidance from conversations CFO Tim Huffmyer (who has historically been fairly conservative with his guidance). And the $400k/Q thereafter uses a historical average. This does not take into account the expected Sunset of Sprint’s legacy subscriber base to SafePath, which will bring an additional 3M/Q in revenue to SMSI. You can read more about this in SMSI’s 2Q18 or 3Q18 CC transcripts.
3. Viewspot is a new purchase in late 2018. I assume growth to be conservative at 100k/Q for 2019, although speaking with management, they’ve told me they expects growth to be \~20-30%.
4. I assume no revenue for SafePath IoT and SafePath Home. Speaking with CFO Tim Huffmyer, he stated that it’s ‘too soon to tell’ on how much revenue these two new expansions will drive in 2019.

My forecast last year and Q1 has been fairly accurate to actual earnings releases (I expected 8.4M in revenue, they came in at 8.43M in 1Q19). I have fairly high confidence that actuals will come in line with these forecasts. If SMSI signs a new carrier, my ’19 and ’20 models will be revised accordingly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2.	Signing more carriers**

Last  year prior to SMSI acquiring ViewSpot, CEO Bill Smith had guided  towards signing a new Tier 1 carrier by 1H19 (all evidence points to  T-Mobile). This would a meaningful win for the company since T-Mobile is  50% larger than Sprint, and SMSI's stock tripled on the Sprint signing.

However  when asked about this guidance on 1Q19’s CC, Bill revised his guidance  in saying he expect the signing would go past his initial guidance of  1H19, but he now expects to sign a new customer for each of Safepath,  CommSuite, and Viewspot.

While I’m not as bullish as Bill, all  data points to T-Mobile has the next SMSI customer. I expect T-Mobile’s  delay may be tied to their impending merger with Sprint, which is  expected to close in the short term.

# So what’s SMSI worth?

&#x200B;

Below I share my revenue guidance for the company. A few granular points to note:

1. The company has higher expenses in Q1 due to higher sales variable cash compensation (bonuses), and trade shows at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), and Mobile World Congress (MWC).
2. The company is ramping up their engineering team for deployments at additional carrier wins this year. CFO Tim Huffmyer told he they currently have 20 open reqs. I have modeled towards increased R&D expense per Tim’s guidance.
3. For expenses, Tim has guided towards a $500k decrease in expenses for Q2, and fairly consistent run rate for 2019, with slight increases in 2H19 due to R&D
4. While management does not provide overall guidance, Tim did say he expects SafePath revenue to increase 30-40% QoQ.

&#x200B;

**SMSI Model**

&#x200B;

A few key takeaways:

1. The company is expected to generate 0.21 in cash EPS next year. Shares currently rate at only $3.30/share.
2. The company has no significant cash obligations and is expected to generate cash every quarter

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

&#x200B;

As a microcap value investor, it’s easy to fall into value traps or invest in cigar butts. However when a true value opportunity arises, it’s hard not to get excited.

SMSI is a profitable software developer with high operating leverage, clean balance sheet, and growing 40%/year without even accounting for the expected large customer wins in the next 7 month.

I won’t dive to deeply on valuation as every investor has their own valuation methods and discount rates. Here’s my simple DCF model:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ax1oqw5sow831.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb4cea7bae13b8d623ba5b7294ffa3c65e24a0b

&#x200B;

A simple DCF valuates the company at **$13/share**. This assumes a 15% discount rate and did not include any future customer wins.

For terminal year, I valued the company at a simple PE of 10. Software application companies traditionally trade at PE of 25+.

If this opportunity looks compelling, I recommend doing your own due diligence and arriving at your own conclusions and value for the company. Please reach out if you find any mistakes or oversight on my part.

t3_caoy1j,Wix.com (WIX) Analysis: Future Growth Potential and Understanding Their Business Model,"Website builders like Squarespace, Weebly and Wix have become a popular way of designing websites. Its easy to use website building tools allow users to easily create a professional looking website with little to no experience.


But why are website builders like Wix.com becoming such a popular choice even among expert website developers?


For beginners, Wix Editor is an easy to use tool that allows you to design your website exactly how you want it using drag and drop tools. There's also Wix ADI which is an artificial intelligence that designs the site for you based on knowledge it gathers of what you like.


For developers, Wix offers a product called Wix Code which gives you full control over your website's functionality with Javascript and Wix Code APIs.


**Important Terms**

Registered User: Created an account, for free

User Cohort: Aggregation of users added in given time period

Premium Subscription: A package purchased by a user; a single user can purchase more than one subscription


**Cohorts**

Cohorts are referred to as a subset of users, categorized by acquisition date. It allows companies to analyze important subscriber metrics like churn, which is when a subscriber ends their paid subscription with a company.

**TROI (Time to Return On (Marketing) Investment)**

TROI can be found by this formula: Revenue gained per Subscriber / Cost to acquire each Subscriber

**How does TROI tie into Cohorts?**

Say your first month of business you gain 100 registered users with 10 of these users paying for a premium subscription. Next month you gain 200 more registered users with 20 of these users paying for premium as well as 10 more of the users from last month converting to premium. Each month your goal is to:

1. Get more users to register
2. Get existing ones to convert to premium
3. And reduce churn


Now say you invest $100 in marketing and in return gain $10 in revenue from subscribers. Overtime your revenue from subscribers will continue to increase as more people continue to pay their subscription or convert to premium. So that initial marketing investment will continuously increase revenue overtime.


So cohorts are important because they are a driving source of future revenue growth. You want last month's registered users to convert to premium and premium users to continue paying for their subscription.


**Wix Subscriber Growth**

- The company’s registered users increased to 142 million as on Dec 31, 2018, up 19% year over year.

- Total subscriptions were 4 million, up 24% year over year.

- Existing cohorts expected to generate future collections of $4.3 Billion

- Every new 100K Net Subscriptions = $165 Million in Collections over 8 years at an 80% Gross Margin

- TROI remained stable over the last 3 years while marketing investment and collections grew 2.3x


**What makes Wix stand out**


**New Products:** Improving and creating new products like Wix Ascend and Turbo create opportunity to expand their user base and convert users to premium subscriptions.

**Global Penetration:** Continued penetration into the company’s geographic area of operations will drive revenue growth into the future. 

**Brand:** Wix.com is the strongest brand in the industry with over 4 million average monthly searches from Jan-Mar 2018

**Partnerships:** Partnerships with the NY Yankees and Manchester City FC are a great way to reach new audiences in an engaging way

**Acquisitions:** DeviantArt, the largest online art gallery and community, was acquired by Wix in February of 2017

**E-Commerce:** Massive growth in e-commerce and transition to mobile sales will give Wix significant long term opportunities with global e-commerce expecting $5T by 2021, according to eMarketer",9,0.91,1562610875.0
t3_caxwld,Am I missing something or do IPOs seem like a really bad deal?,"I'm talking about your standard book build not the new direct stuff that slack and spotify did recently.

Anyway, thinking about it, as an investor, the way these deals are structured, it seems to me your upside is severely limited while your downside is not. 

You apply for your allocation through your broker. If its a popular IPO, it will be oversubscribed and your upside is scaled back as you get less shares than you applied for. Since high demand tends to equal high prices, when you make a good pick you're not rewarded as well as you should be. If on the other hand the IPO is a dud you'll get your full allocation and you'll get to experience the lovely likely subsequent shareprice drop in full. 

Unless you're absolutely certain the IPO price is way undervalued, I don't see why you'd want to participate. And lets face it if we could be certain about things we'd all just go to vegas and forget about this whole investing thing anyway. 

It's a game of risk vs reward and unless I'm missing something IPOs don't seem to add up very well for us pleb individual investors.",27,0.83,1562659590.0

t3_cc5rkg,SRCI - SRC Energy - Valuing An Oil & Gas Company," 

Whilst I’m not a huge fan of investing in commodities like Oil & Gas, base metals, and etc., I thought it’d still be interesting to make today’s article and video about this topic, and will be using SRC Energy as an example company on how you may want to approach valuing Oil & Gas equities.

**Reasons why I dislike commodity equities:**

* Not only do you need to know your company, you also need to be fully across macro economics and socio-political factors - this will mean you’ll be at a significant disadvantage if you’re not an industry insider;
* Oil & Gas reserves are based on technical reports and analysis by “competent persons” - nobody can ever be 100% sure how much Oil & Gas is underneath the ground, hence the inherent nature of these equities are higher risk;

**What are reserves?**

There are 3 types of reserves:

* Proven - 90% of commercial feasibility to extract
* Probable - 50% of commercial feasibility to extract
* Possible (inferred/indicated) - 10% feasibility to extract

As mentioned above, this is measured by “competent persons” and is their best educated guess, based on various techniques and methods - it’s uneconomical to dig up an entire patch of ground or a seabed to make 100% certain, hence there is always room for human error.

There are also “resources”, which happens to be measured by the same group of “competent persons” - these are not classified as reserves because they’re less confident about these, hence why they’re classed as “resources” - all of this seems highly anecdotal to me, which is why as an average retail investor, I think it’s safer to discount the potential value of these “resources” (unless you’re well versed in reading 150+ page technical reports, drilling, fracking, engineering, geology, etc.)...

**What are SRCI’s reserves worth?**

Based on the tables below, I've used SRCI's proven reserves as per their FY 18 report. As you can see on fig 1, they have 88mm Bbl's of oil, 771.9 bn c/f of gas, and 89.1mm Bbl's of NGLs (proven).

On fig 2, I've plotted their operating and net margins - these are inclusive of cash costs, and all expenses such as royalties, sustaining CAPEX, OPEX, project CAPEX, and even derivative gains or losses (because commodity companies sell into the spot market, but they always have a portion of their book hedged).

What's important to pay attention to is that they will always achieve a sales price less than the spot price, for this very reason. Therefore, it's also important to discount the net value of SCRI's reserves by the average percentage difference in realized vs. spot price, in addition to a 10 - 15% margin of safety discount one would normally apply.

[Fig 1](https://preview.redd.it/2zl80eazms931.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d5c8a776f7018231b129be77b7c517b7fb7d50e)

**Other factors to consider:**

* The next oil bear and bull market - how long these will last for;
* What are the geo-political uncertainties e.g.: Libya, Iran, overproduction, undersupply, manipulation by OPEC, etc.;
* How American Oil & Gas companies can remain competitive, if they need to ship their exports across an entire ocean vs. Gazprom being able to deliver it directly via it’s pipeline network

**If you prefer a video analysis, please see below:**

[**https://youtu.be/It-1r3npH\_g**](https://youtu.be/It-1r3npH_g)

In summation, I believe SRC Energy is trading at or slightly above fair value, when comparing their Enterprise Value to net value of reserves (at the average price). If we see another oil bear market, then SRC Energy will become loss-making (like back in 2015-2016), therefore there is not enough of a margin of safety to consider this stock just now.",9,1.0,1562903360.0

The main allegation of the report is that Anta secretly controls a few dozen of their main distributors (which accounted for about 1/3 of revenues), while claiming that all their distributors are independent parties. The purpose is to control the finance departments of these distributors, in order to inflate the profits of the Listco.

The report discloses the financials of these distributors, which show mostly break even to slight profits. Assuming that these distributors are not independent parties, it follows that we should consolidate their results. But, if we do that, it will not change the reported profits. So, I don't see much of a case here.

t3_cdqj8t,Long Thesis on Unity Biotech,"**Overview:** This post seeks to articulate an investment thesis for [Unity Biotechnolog](http://ir.unitybiotechnology.com/)y (UBX). *I welcome any perspectives that challenge this thesis.* In light of Unity’s strong team, promising science, risk mitigation strategy, large market potential, loosely defined category, and recent pullback in valuation I believe this is an opportune time to begin building exposure to the company. Unity is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing drugs to extend human health span (defined as how long we live free of chronic diseases of ageing). Unity works across the spectrum of mechanisms that drive aging with a near term priority to remove senescence cells for patients with osteoarthritis (the main reason it hurts to be old). Senescence cells (SC) are cells that no longer divide and tend to poison around nearby tissue (cause inflammation). Beyond osteoarthritis, Unity will also work to rollout similar therapies for eye, pulmonary, and cognitive diseases which affects millions of aging individuals. Unity’s current market cap is 360MM, the company went public in May 2018 at a valuation of 700MM valuation.

**What difficult problem is the company solving (better than others)?** Key questions include: Why do people get sicker as we age? Are there drugs to halt, slow, or potentially reverse the mechanisms of aging? What is the most impactful disease to demonstrate the drug’s efficacy and safety? As context, quality of life decreases as we age due to a number of factors including stem cells (loss of mitochondrial function), nutrient sensing (caloric restriction as we age), circulating youth factors (loss of protein production) and cellular senescence (cells that no longer split and cause multiple issues in nearby micro tissue). Unity focuses on cellular senescence, not because it is the only or even most important aging mechanism, but because of all the mechanisms identified to date, it is the most “druggable” approach (i.e. easiest to make drugs and molecules to combat against). During the last 7 years, Unity has proven their thesis in mice allocating several rounds of venture capital to mitigate the main scientific questions and company killer risks. The scientific breakthrough leading to company’s creation occurred in 2008, when Judy Campisy (one of Unity’s co-founders) effectively showed that accumulation of SC poisons local tissue and contributes to diseases of aging, based on this and subsequent scientific research, the team at Unity proved that removing SC in mice (genetically engineered to age faster), not only increased lifespan by \~35% but improved bone density, mobility, hair growth, and decreased cognitive decline, materially improving overall health span. Unity recently completed Phase 1 clinical trials to prove safety and tolerability in humans with osteoarthritis of the knee. Over the next few quarters the company will work to replicate the technical success seen from removing SC in mice on humans and will continue to expand its pipeline. Next areas of focus will include ophthalmology, pulmonary, and cognitive diseases of age affecting millions of aging Americans.

**Is this the right/best team to solve this problem?** Unity features a solid team  (presumably the best) to succeed in this nascent but promising field. Nathaniel (Ned) David (President and co-Founder) co-founding four biotech companies (two exits large exists, one for $270mm another for $2.1bn) and gotten two drugs approved. Ned is also a tenured partner at ARCH Ventures (credible biotech VC firm with strong realizations). Sapphire Energy (genetically engineered algae to produce liquid transportation fuels) was a well documented failure executed proved leading bio-engineering and built production at scale, the company was backed with Bill Gates. Technical co-founders include two pioneers in the field of aging research: Judith Campisi (Buck Institute) and Jan Van Deursen (Mayo Clinic). Keith Leonard (former CEO at Kythera) acts as Unity’s CEO and has worked with Ned for 15 years and was a former senior executive at Amgen. The board features prominent VCs and scientists (Bob Nelsen and Kristine Burow from ARCH Ventures, Camille Samuels from Venrock, Margo Roberts former CSO of Kite Pharma). Financial backers include top-tier VCs and Family Offices featuring Jeff Bezos, Peter Theil, and Paul Allen among other prominent financial and strategic institutions that further legitimize the investment opportunity and caliber of the team.

**How will Unity capture, distribute, and realize value? Is their position sustainable and defensible?** Unity is a clinical stage/pre-revenue company focused on R&D. There is little visibility as to timeline of commercializing any of its drugs yet, let alone go-to-market strategy. This is common of early stage biotechnology companies. Guidance on pricing, go-to-market, and distribution will likely be provided as closer to Phase 3 and commercial viability. As customary, we expect the company’s position to be defensible though the use of patents, intellectual property rights, as well as exclusive licensing and/or royalty structure with leading larger pharma partners.

**What is the market opportunity and state of competition?** The market for health span drugs is large given the tens of millions of aging baby boomers in America and other developed markets suffering from arthritis, pulmonary, eye and cognitive diseases related to aging with estimates of potential royalty payments between 2-5 billion. There are multiple smaller players in the field pursuing multiple other mechanisms but generally lack both credible talent and financial backing. Competition from large pharmaceutical companies is not evident at this stage but expected to increase as technical and commercial feasibility becomes more evident. A potential acquisition is a probable scenario but Unity also has the potential to become a durable and standalone commercial aging platform (releasing new drugs with little incremental cost) to generate large future cash flows streams.

**Why is now the right time to invest?** Biotech is a risky endeavor, it takes time and capital with significant binary risk. Due to the slow nature of clinical trials it could be 2-3 years before their thesis fully plays out -- by such time it may be too late to fully participate in the upside. Given this uncertainty, young and smaller capitalization companies fluctuate widely in value, making an investment highly speculative and prone to failure. As of July 2019, Unity has lost nearly 50% of its IPO valuation and trades at a small premium to all capital raised to date (market value to total paid-in capital of \~15%). Due to high R&D and overhead, a dilutive follow-on transaction is likely within the next 12-18 months. This investment represents an  opportunity to gain exposure to VC like risk/reward through a public vehicle. Unity looks like an option to get exposure to an emerging and large vertical of healthcare. Although highly speculative this seems like an opportune time to build a position in the company. Consider building exposure a 4-5% exposure at \~$8.5/share leaving reserves to accumulate more with more evidence of technical success. I welcome your views on this thesis\*!\*

t3_cenxkw,Qudian Update Analysis (QD:NYSE) - Potential 3 - 4 Bagger?,"Hey guys,

I've decided to make a follow up analysis (on QD) to my previous one back in May. Previous reddit post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/bvppb0/high\_risk\_high\_reward\_qudian\_qdnyse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/bvppb0/high_risk_high_reward_qudian_qdnyse/)

My initial analysis saw an 80% upside, which I believe was too conservative. Let's explore a few things below, to see why...

**QD is the top performer amongst its industry peers**

[Fig 1](https://preview.redd.it/ign2p50cmza31.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b406368e6baf1041ed421f27b55716ff79d44074)

As you can see in Fig 1, QD has the lowest default rates amongst its peers - the lower the default the better, because any default when it comes to lending means write-offs and charge-offs, which lead to impairments that hurt EPS.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, XRF is 7 months late on its 20-F, Q418, and Q119 reports - red flag. Moreover, JT's sales & marketing expense is >60% of its revenue, resulting in net margins of \~2%. YRD is not bad, but it still has a large portion of its funding coming from P2P sources. PPDF is also not bad, but what separates QD apart is how high the repeat borrowing rate is, and how low the default rate is.

&#x200B;

This is important because the cost of acquiring a new customers is 3 -5x that of maintaining your existing customers (source: Forbes).

&#x200B;

**QD has an issue of too much demand (this is a great problem to have)!**

&#x200B;

[http://ir.qudian.com/financials/quarterly-earnings](http://ir.qudian.com/financials/quarterly-earnings)

&#x200B;

Having reviewed all of their earnings call transcripts, the prevailing theme is that they have too much demand, and are playing catch up to secure funding, to service this demand. Despite growing their loan book to >35 billion RMB, they are still only able to service a fraction of their user base and approved borrowers...

[Fig 2](https://preview.redd.it/gcwyg0eqnza31.jpg?width=1166&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8833226eb38e03b0121678d72c2606cf23a1dcb)

As you can see on Fig 2, QD only serves \~5.5 million of their 29.1 million credit approved borrowers. This means they have the analytics and data for the other \~23 million not being served - a valuable asset - it's no surprise they launched their open platform to refer these to funding partners who can exceed their max lending limit of 6000 RMB; QD's CFO has stated on many occasions that they do not wish to exceed this sweet spot, as their target market is Chinese young people making 3000 - 5000 RMB per month (the under-served with no credit history).

&#x200B;

Since the inception of their open platform only 2 quarters ago, QD has referred 160,000 transactions for a total borrowing value of 1.8 billion RMB, with average borrowings of 8000 RMB per person (Q1 FY19 earnings call transcript notes).

&#x200B;

Based on this, I've used Fig 2 to project what could realistically be their revenue stream from the open platform alone, in the future quarters (serving a similar sized user base). Their take rates for their organic business is 13 - 15%, vs. 5 - 10% for referral business, but the referral business carries no risk and is effectively pure profit.

&#x200B;

**QD is misunderstood**

&#x200B;

For the purposes of my intrinsic value calculation, I will only use their current updated Net Profit FY 19 guidance, and leave all profits from the referral business as upside. Please refer to Fig 3 below:

[Fig 3](https://preview.redd.it/ie307uj3pza31.jpg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32aa9c88f5245f05a652283cecc3e9cf2fdf5fe7)

Based on current EPS and EPS growth, I've assigned a re-rate to a PE multiple of 10 - 12, and a 30 - 50% EPS growth for FY20. You may think this is too bullish, but my reasons are below:

* QD is still being lumped into the same group as P2P lending peers, despite them no longer conducting any P2P lending whatsoever;
* This is a young industry, hence I have limited data, but assessing the oldest of the group (YRD) and QD's previous PE historical trend, I believe 10 - 12 is a logical earnings multiple (see Fig 4 and Fig 5 below)

[Fig 4](https://preview.redd.it/1ts5ahenpza31.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7566ec0e0c89bb382030357b6eff01c8b3ace12d)

[Fig 5](https://preview.redd.it/k915hii8qza31.jpg?width=732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bc8a121b7af6177f487a4f0c3d236e3bc049dd3)

**Fig 6 - why I'm confident in another 30 - 50% EPS growth in FY 20**

Below are some relevant comments from QD's CFO, which highlights why I don't believe a 30 - 50% EPS increase for FY20 is too bullish. These comments are from their earnings call transcripts:

[Fig 6](https://preview.redd.it/9qji7dmgqza31.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=769e6faec331797f55812705fd116691ddf324d3)

**In Summation**

Based on the above, I believe there is sufficient evidence QD will be trading at the \~$25 - $30 range in the next 18 - 24 months.

&#x200B;

t3_chp9r4,"SNC-Lavalin Group (TSX:SNC, SNCAF)","This is my latest research piece of SNC-Lavalin that I recently just published on Seeking Alpha. You can read it here: [SNC-Lavalin: Buy A Highway, Get The E&C For Cheap](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275981-snc-lavalin-buy-highway-get-e-and-c-cheap).

 

Unfortunately the publication of my [article ](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275981-snc-lavalin-buy-highway-get-e-and-c-cheap)corresponded with a significant press release from SNC and a public statement from the CDPQ . On the news the stock went from $25 to $21 per share. That’s my timing for you.

Of course nobody wants to see bad news but I believe this is the news that we were looking for. I see the recent announcements as positives.  It’s like a doctor telling you that you are getting brain surgery to remove a tumor. It’s not good news but that’s what needed. Short-term pain for a better future.

In the article I said that I wouldn’t be surprised that the new CEO takes the quarter as an opportunity to ditch guidance and dump more bad news and that’s exactly what happened. SNC took a $1.9b impairment charge link to its oil and gas division, Kentz. They already took a $1.2b impairment charge back in February. SNC bought Kentz for $2.1b back in 2014. The CDPQ, the largest shareholder with 19.9%, publicly came out against the deterioration of SNC performance. Back in the spring the CDPQ said they will “be a rock” for SNC, I guess they are losing patience like everyone else.

SNC is facing many headwinds, operationally, financially, politically, reputationally…let’s quickly address them:

* SNC has been having operational issues. SNC some good assets and bad assets. The recent restructure announced will have SNC focus on its strong points. SNC is still in business. They are still winning contracts. SNC is walking away from Turnkey lump sump projects, the key source of its problems. Exit: O&G, mining, and construction which are its least profitable activities.They will focus on design, nuclear, engineering services “EDPM”.  They will be less risky and more cash-flow predictable. More details on the new strategy is expected in the fall. The future SNC might look like more of a WSP Global or Stantec.
* Finance: SNC took on a lot of debt for its WS Atkins acquisition of $3.6b in 2017. Despite paying a big price for Atkins, it’s one of the strong points of SNC today. To deal with the debt SNC is selling part of their private highway, cut the dividend, and is engaged on a cost cutting program. Once the sale is completed SNC debt’s level should be back to their historical norm of low debt. SNC also has $13.87 (post-H407 sale) of net assets in their Capital Investment Portfolio.
* Politics: Unfortunately SNC was in the middle of a political scandal for the Trudeau’s Liberal government. SNC was also a victim of a diplomatic spat between Saudi Arabia and Canada. There’s not much in SNC’s control at the moment. Hopefully after the election the government will finally find a solution to SNC’s legal problems.
* Reputation: SNC didn’t murder anybody but you would think they did. Their reputation is not good. It’s affecting employee morale and departures. The public perception of the company is toxic. SNC is managing a PR crisis. SNC, a 100+ year old company, has its brand; a once valued intangible asset is now in the garbage bin. You can change a reputation. Merck’s Vioxx is responsible for the death of 38,000 people and the company is still around. With SNC it will take time. I don’t expect anything before the Canadian Federal election in October. Plus they have to Libya bribery court case they have to deal with. It will take a lot of time, a string of good news/quarters, and communications to deal its reputation.

With the recent announcements, SNC has a market cap of $3.6 billion, the same price they bought WS Atkins in 2017. Atkins is one of the most respected planning and project management firm in the world. The stock is cheap and very attractive for a competitor looking to expand. The CDPQ has \~20% and RBC recently built a 16.6%. I understand this is a difficult stock to hold or even buy. It’s not supposed to be easy. I believe SNC will eventually emerged a better company.

t3_cikm7j,Gym Group Long Thesis,"The Gym Group (LSE:GYM) operate 166 (158 at the end of 2018) low cost gyms in the UK with 89 sites at maturity at the end of 2018 with 74 at the end of 2017. They have around 750,000 members.

The only other major player in the low cost gym industry in the UK to note is PureGym, who operate 222 gyms with 1,000,000+ members. PureGym are a private company funded by borrowing, with negative equity. Whilst they are the bigger operator, both companies (and a PwC industry report) believe there is significant headroom in the market. They should both be able to grow for the next several years without having to compete with each other too directly.

Their 2018 earnings of £7.2m compared to their market cap of £365m yields a PE ratio of 50, making them look significantly overpriced.

However, as only 56% of their sites are at maturity, this doesn’t tell the full picture.

Alternative valuation calculations

EBITDA per mature site is £440k. The previous year was £461k (in 79 sites), suggesting that the 15 new mature sites are operating at £336k EBITDA, assuming the original 79 stayed constant. The smaller EBITDA number for 2018 was to be expected due to a number of smaller gyms being opened. The £336k prediction for future gyms will therefore be towards the lower end assuming all non-mature gyms are of the smaller format.

Depreciation for the year was £19.7m. Assuming this is split evenly across all 158 sites gives £125k per site. Splitting it just across the mature gyms yields £221k.

Assuming the new gyms are similar in nature to the last 15 reaching maturity, we can project earnings for two years’ time if TGC stop all expansionary activity.

EBITDA for 158 sites = £62.3m (89 * £440k + 69 * £336k)
Depreciation of £19.7m to £34.9m
2018 Amortisation = £2.05m

EBIT = £25.4m to £40.6m
2018 Interest = £1.75m
Assumed effective tax rate = 22%

Profit after tax = £18.4m - £30.3m
True PE ratio = 12.0 - 19.8

Given the historic, and hopefully future, growth rate of the business, this PE ratio range suggests to me that the business is undervalued, particularly towards the lower end which seems more reasonable based on the depreciation range being used (as straight line depreciation is being used then it should already be affecting the non-mature gyms as it would the mature ones).

In addition to calculating the true PE ratio of the company, using Buffett’s owners’ earnings calculation will provide us with the cash we should expect to receive if we were running the business, after subtracting the maintenance capex costs for upkeep (but not expansionary capex costs).

Reported earnings = £7.2m
Dep &amp;amp;amp; am = 19.7+2.1 = £21.8m
Maintenance capex = - £8.3m
Working capital changes = -£8m
Owner earnings = £12.7m
Price to owner earnings = 29

Re-calculating owners’ earnings with the fully matured estimate above yields:

Reported earnings = £18.4m
Dep &amp;amp;amp; am = 34.9 + 2.1 = £37.0m
Maintenance capex = -£14.7m (assuming £8.3m today is related to mature sites and future mature sites have the same cost)
Working capital changes = -£8m
Owner earnings = £32.7m
Price to owner earnings = 11

Although marginally over the 10 times owners’ earnings figure Buffett would want to see in an investment opportunity, the growth rate of the business makes up for this in my opinion.

For me, it’s right on the edge of what I’d consider whilst still having a large margin of safety and I’m trying to develop my understanding of the business somewhat before investing, so I’m keen to hear any thoughts in case there’s something I’ve missed!",31,0.9,1564250074.0

I personally hold tremendous respect and to this day still get butterflies whenever I get to read about investing (literally) and it makes me the happiest man alive and was wondering what drives to like investing ? Personally, at first, I just got caught by the “bug”, I wanted to live and breathe investing and the idea of making money out of money was genius (I was 12 at the time) and then it just stuck by me. Over the years I’ve discovered that investing has more to do with the fact that it reflects my natural attributes. Such as:

* Have tremendous skin in the game, I’m a personal believer that equity investors hold the ultimate risk in any business they hold capital in. 
* Can learn about the world as I learn about business. Throughout history, business and economics have been one of the main factors that have shaped who we are and through business I can continue to see the current and upcoming human trends and psyches. 
* Investors are looking for the truth and there’s a clear scoreboard. 
* I love digging for information but I get bored quickly because I am good at exhausting everything there is to read on a certain topic, but with finance there’s always something new to analyze, read, learn. You’re never 100% right in investing, you just became less likely to be wrong. 
* Learn valuable skills that can be transferrable. It appears to be that the truly great investors (the Buffett’s, munger’s, dalio’s), have learned tremendously about the world and how it works and are kinda showing us young guns how to do it. The analytical research skills in investment are hardly found anywhere else and the reading that comes with the career holds tremendous compound interest potential on your knowledge!
* reading a lot
* Make $ 
* I originally come from a MENA (raised in Canada) background where I saw the disastrous effects of having no free market and no capital to start anything at all. Seen a lot of bright and ambitious people being stopped by the lack capital to kickstart themselves.
* Can understand life through business such as fundamental social reactions to events and forming trends in the marketplace.

t3_clqet4,Question - Valuation of a Bank - impact of interest rates,"So, I am in the midst of doing a valuation of some regional banks and insurance companies (general insurance and some title insurance) for a Fund Management class I am taking this summer.

I have noticed that a key profitability ratio for banks is the Net Interest Margin.  This being the differential between the interest rate banks get charged for a loan (FED & Inter-bank rate) versus what they can charge their customers (on average).

I realized that the costs of borrowing (for the bank) is a linear relationship, where as the income generated is an exponential. This exponential relationship being based on the fact that the banks can loan each dollar borrowed multiple times. 

So the impact the impact of lowering interest rates will be linear on the cost side while exponential on the income side. Assuming that competitive forces impose downward pressure on the upper end of the net interest margin, those who utilize higher Net Interest Margins feeling the worst of the effects due to the exponential relationship.

This isn't too big of a deal if the bank is lending each dollar a moderate amount of times. 1-5x isn't too painful, but 10-12x starts to look ugly, and 16x...well it's just funny at that point.

t3_cn57i5,Long Thesis. CARE Ratings Ltd NSE:CARERATINGS,"Note: 1 lakh = 10\^5 and 1 crores = 10\^7. FY17 = 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017

*This was written on Tuesday so the PE multiple might be a bit off.*

CARE Ratings is India's second largest credit ratings agency. It is the second player in an oligopolistic market, with high barriers to entry. At 11x trailing EPS this seems like the perfect place to buy a great business at a decent price.

THE BUSINESS

CARE's core business is exactly the same as credit rating agencies across the world. They rate corporate bonds and bank debt of companies that are borrowing money. CARE gets paid a % of the bank loans/ bonds by the company that wants to borrow money. After the company borrows money, the rating process is not over. CARE has to rate the debt of the company as long as it has debt outstanding (which the company has to pay for). This process is required by SEBI and so CARE gets a steady recurring revenue stream as long as the company has debt outstanding.

WHY THE STOCK IS CHEAP

In September of 2018 India's largest transport finance company's subsidiaries defaulted on its bank loans (IL&FS default). This triggered a review in 2018 by SEBI (India's market regulator) about the processes of credit rating agencies. CARE and ICRA (Moody's subsidiary in India) had both rated IL&FS AAA till it defaulted on its debt. CARE stock has fallen \~62% from its 52 wk high of 1395. To add to the problems of the company an anonymous complaint was received by SEBI that the senior management took bribes to give better ratings to IL&FS. The CFO resigned recently with no explanation given. This has had investors spooked about the future of the company. The company reported weak Q1 numbers, and the price fell 36% (as of  6 Aug). The Q1 numbers are

The company is currently facing short term headwinds (weak corporate borrowing, regulatory scrutiny leading to CEO fired, CFO resigning) and so Mr. Market has marked down the price of the company. There is unwarranted negative sentiment about the company.

THE THESIS

1.You don't need smart management to run the business.

CARE's business is a toll booth into the debt markets and for borrowing from banks. All management has to do is: A. Rate companies B. Return cash to shareholders. CARE's management has understood B very well and has had a payout ratio of 65%. On the point of A, I feel that after the IL&FS scandal, the increased regulatory scrutiny has led the ratings agencies to be more conservative in their ratings, and this is a plus in the long term. Even if SEBI bans Rajesh Mokashi from ever running a ratings agency, they have enough depth to get new management. And in the end management doesn't matter that much in this business. (Proverbial idiot being able to run a business)

2.The impact of regulatory scrutiny is over-emphasized

The main concern of the bears is that: SEBI will ban CARE from rating companies like they did with Deloitte for auditing. This seems unlikely. The main complaint SEBI has with CARE seems to be that they revised their ratings extremely quickly just before the default. From a recent new article: “Despite four changes to ratings rules in the last three years for improving transparency and processes, agencies still make abrupt, multi-level downgrades from top ratings to junk, rattling the market. A case in point is the sudden downgrade of bonds sold by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) and related entities after they defaulted on payment obligations in September.” source: [https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/sebi-rbi-examining-business-models-of-rating-agencies-1558030782374.html](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/sebi-rbi-examining-business-models-of-rating-agencies-1558030782374.html)

The most likely things seem to be: 1. SEBI requires that the ratings agencies keep the ratings committee separate from management. 2. They have a probability of default on the rating.

Neither of these damage the earnings/cashflows of the company. In the long run in my opinion, these rules should improve the quality of ratings, and so reduce future regulatory scrutiny is reduced.

3.The business is still a high return on capital business

Excluding cash and ST investments, PreTax ROC (EBIT/ (Assets- NIBCL)) has been between 42% and 30%. Even if you assume that they cut prices (after all they will get stares from regulators for increasing prices just after the crisis), and if they have lower margins as a result of this, EBIT margins  could go down to 30% if the price per rupee of debt rated goes down even 10%. This business has high operating leverage and this means that if in the future, they are able to increase the price per rupee of debt rated by 10%, then margins will go up very quickly. Either way RoC should remain in the downside 20%, and in the upside 40%. The company will sustainably earn in excess of its cost of capital even in the most poor environment,

4. The market is forgetting that the business has an extremely long runway to grow

The corporate bond market in India is expected to double by 2023. This means that if and when the economy picks up then CARE should see revenue growth in the mid-teens and the operating leverage along with it. This increases the top possible margin to 60% EBIT like it was in FY16 and FY17. High ROC + Long growth = Great Business to own for the long term

5. The company has a target on its back and is stuffing the income statement with every expense they can find.

Employee expenses are up 16% YoY and “Other expenses” are up 24% YoY. My (unproven) hypothesis is that the company is trying to send a message to regulators that they aren't making too much money and so shouldn't be fined as harshly.

IS THE COMPANY A FRAUD?

I don't think the company is a fraud despite the CFO resignation. It does sound suspicious and does warrant further investigation. My personal hypothesis is that the CFO knew that the company would come under investigation and didn't want his name tarnished. But as I showed earlier, you don't need a Jack Welch-like person to run this business. You just need someone who rates bonds and pays out dividends.

VALUATION

Comps trade at 25x ttm EPS and CARE trades at 11x ttm EPS. The market should recognize this discount when the cloud over the business from SEBI scrutiny and the slowing economy goes away. Another way of approaching this is that the company needs close to zero capex in excess of depreciation. From FY15 to FY19 Net PPE increased by only 1722 lakhs (1 lakh = 10\^5 rupees) while EBIT increased by 1686 lakh rupees. Almost all of the net income can be treated as FCF. This means that (although we haven't got the FY19 CF statement), FCF for FY2019 will be in the range of net income. If FCF is 10767 lakhs, market cap is 147400 lakhs, the company trades in the range of 13x FCF. This implies a 7.6% FCF yield + a growing stream of cashflows. This is clearly cheap and has a long way to go.

Bear Case

Net Income stays constant forever and regulators fine the company 10% of revenues. This leads to a 1 time drop in earnings. The company is valued without growth at a 14x FCF multiple. This implies an upside of 7%.

Base Case

Revenues grow at 6% (GDP level)

Net Margin stabilizes to 30% so FY 21 Net income is 10143 lakhs. This should be valued at a multiple of 25x (as a net margin of 30% implies a RoC in the high teens/low twenties which warrants such a high multiple). This means that a market cap of 25 billion rupees in 2021. That means that investors today will get a 33% annualized return. The regulators don't fine the company

Bull Case

The economy picks up and grows at 8% (The RBI target). The RBI reduces regulation on corporate bond markets and they go to developed market levels. CARE would have 15% revenue growth and extremely high margins implying a 50% upside when operating leverage kicks in. If valued at 30x earnings (justified due to the 30%+ ROC that the company will have in the case), investors should see a 50%+ annualized return for the next few years",9,0.85,1565181256.0

Then they provided a table showing future minimum annual rentals over the next 5+ years. Are these projections of the percentage rentals to be paid over the next 5+ years based on future sales or are they recognizing the percentage rental payments for current and prior year sales over the 5+ year window?

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eqt-corp-rice-proxy/rice-group-wins-board-control-at-gas-producer-eqt-new-ceo-to-be-named-idUSKCN1U51Q5

And they think a lot of costs can be taken out of EQT, so that seems like good news for EQM, as that means probably more production growth. 

Debt is managable at 3.5-4x EBITDA and they are forecast to earn $900 to $950 million on a market cap of $6.2 billion.

They are building a new pipeline which is 85% complete (and they get some income from it already) which had issues with environmentalists and cost overruns. This is expected to be finished somewhere in 2020 and add about 30% to EBITDA.

But overall with the deep level of gas inventory and likely modest production growth in the area, this is a very cheap stock. Meanwhile you get over 14% of your money back within a year.

There is the risk of lower rates, but that is mitigated IMO, as EQT owns almost 20% of EQM and pipelines are hard to build due to environmentalists. They are not exactly a commodity in most areas, which gives pipeline companies generally a decent amount of leverage.

And CEO of ETRN (which owns 54% of EQM) bought $8m of shares recently at higher prices:

IMO I think that the the first group offers a better chance at higher returns over the long run. Owning a company whose value is increasing over time as you can get valuation slightly off, and still do well. Also companies with moats require much less maintenance research than a company which you plan to sell just at/below value.  The second camp means that you might be holding a melting ice cube. Hold it for too long and its all gone.

t3_csmlyq,Cyclerion Therapeutics: Application to Value Investors Club,"I applied to the Value Investors Club with the below please let me know your thoughts.

# Why it’s interesting

The three reasons I think this is an interesting idea are that Cyclerion comes from a spinoff which **initially looks ugly to the parent company’s investor base** leading to a sell off, that **most of the top executives and founders of Ironwood chose to work at the smaller no revenue producing Cyclerion** with some even buying shares of the company in the open market making it appear to be an attractive place to build equity and that **there is a potentially very near term catalyst resulting between September and December**.

# The spinoff

In the 10-12B, Ironwood states:

*The strategic objectives of the separation are to unlock value, enhance operational performance and strategic flexibility and tailor the capital structures to best serve these distinct businesses.*

* *Going forward,* ***Ironwood intends to focus primarily on programs targeting treatments for GI diseases and abdominal pain****. Ironwood's assets are expected to continue to include its flagship product linaclotide, which is available in the United States and over 30 countries worldwide for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, or chronic idiopathic constipation under the brand names LINZESS® and CONSTELLA® (linaclotide). In addition to commercializing linaclotide, the company also intends to develop and commercialize (if approved) its core pipeline candidates, IW-3718, a Phase 3 program being developed for the potential treatment of persistent gastroesophageal disease, and MD-7246 (formerly linaclotide delayed release), which is being evaluated for the treatment of abdominal pain associated with all forms of IBS. All of Ironwood's current linaclotide collaborations will remain with Ironwood.*
* *The new company, which has been named Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc., or* ***Cyclerion****,* ***expects to leverage its pioneering work in cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or cGMP, and sGC pharmacology*** ***to advance an innovative pipeline of five distinct programs*** *focused on the treatment of serious and orphan diseases.*

*At launch, Cyclerion's portfolio will comprise five differentiated sGC stimulator programs:*

* *olinciguat, currently in a Phase 2 trial as an oral, once-daily vascular sGC stimulator for patients suffering from sickle cell disease;*
* *praliciguat, in two separate Phase 2 trials as an oral, once-daily systemic sGC stimulator for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, and for diabetic nephropathy, respectively;* 
* *IW-6463, a central nervous system-penetrant oral sGC stimulator, is currently in a Phase 1 first-in-human study and is designed to treat serious and orphan neurodegenerative diseases; and* 
* *two organ-targeted programs to address serious and orphan diseases of the liver and lung, respectively.*

The spinoff Cyclerion is initially ugly looking because it comprises of 5 products that are only in clinical trials or discovery phases and seems extremely difficult to value. I originally almost stopped looking when I learned that Cyclerion is a company with products only in a testing phase. I believe if you had bought Ironwood prior to the spinoff your thesis was about the LINZESS® product and the Gastrointestinal Disease market. The separation of Cyclerion looks like a lottery ticket about sGC stimulators which as an investor you likely have no idea about and not enough time to become an expert. **Why risk your capital on the results of trials?** You may as well sell now with the guarantee of value and only keep the shares of profitable Ironwood.

On April 2nd Cylerion officially started trading as CYCN opening at around $20 a share with a market cap of around 550 million and closed at $14.50. CYCN never got to $20 again. Today CYCN is at $8.85. Ironwood at that time had a market cap of around $2 billion. I believe the drop in price occurred because of how ugly and different it appeared to Ironwood investors and encouraged them to get cash today.

# So actually though why risk your capital on this?

At this point it seems to make sense as an Ironwood investor why you would sell this. I almost gave up on this ugly duckling that appears as a lottery ticket, but then I asked what do insiders think? My discovery was that they clearly think this is a very attractive opportunity. Almost all top executives and founders have left Ironwood for Cyclerion. They left a company with a profitable product for one that will be defined by testing results. They must feel pretty good about what the outcomes will be. 

# The team that left Ironwood

1. **Mark Currie, PhD - President and Chief Scientific Officer**   
Mark is the primary inventor of LINZESS®, a market‑leading treatment for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. Mark led R&D at Ironwood and was the Chief Scientific Officer. Prior to Ironwood, Mark led the discovery group at Sepracor and discovery pharmacology at Monsanto/Searle, which produced several important medicines, including LUNESTA® and CELEBREX®.
2. **Peter Hecht, PhD - Chief Executive Officer**  
Peter served as co-founder, chief executive officer and director of Ironwood from 1998 to 2019. During his tenure, Ironwood grew from nine PhD scientists to a commercial biotechnology company that discovered, developed and is now commercializing LINZESS® – the branded prescription market leader in its class.
3. **William Huyett - Chief Financial Officer**  
William served as Chief Operating Officer of Ironwood. William Huyett, has extensive experience in pharmaceutical and medical device corporate strategy, capital allocation, finance, product development and commercialization, and corporate leadership gained during his 30‑year career at McKinsey and Company, Inc. 
4. **Brian Cali, PhD - Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications**  
Brian co‑founded Ironwood Pharmaceuticals in 1998. From then until joining Cyclerion in 2019, he served in various enterprise leadership roles, including responsibility for discovery and early development activities, program leadership and portfolio management, R&D strategy, assessment and in-licensing of external innovations, and corporate communications and investor relations.
5. **Christopher Wright, MD, PhD - Chief Medical Officer**  
Christopher led the global development organization at Ironwood, including responsibility for advancing the late‑stage and life‑cycle gastrointestinal programs. He has two decades of medical research and drug development experience in orphan and specialty diseases, including cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy and dementia. While at Vertex, Chris oversaw the development of ORKAMBI® through Phase 3, and the successful development and rapid approval of KALYDECO®, a life‑changing cystic fibrosis therapy, by the FDA, EMA and other health authorities. He also played an important role in the global development and approval of INCIVEK® for hepatitis C.

# What's at stake for the team?

We have established that this past successful team has left a company with guaranteed revenues for one in trial phases. What other ways can we quantify how valuable this team thinks the equity will be? Let’s see how they get paid first.

Any unvested stock options and restricted stock units in Ironwood will be substituted to Cyclerion options or Cyclerion restricted stock options. According to the 10-12B this was the salaries of some of the executives in 2018:

Peter M. Hecht, Ph.D $100,000 salary with option awards of $3,842,268  
Mark G. Currie, Ph.D. $485,000 salary with option awards of $1,424,289  
William Huyett $465,000 salary with option awards of $2,346,469

As we can see most of their salaries at Ironwood were in options which they decided to convert to Cyclerion options. There is another item in executive compensation stating:

*“Since co-founding Ironwood in 1998, Dr. Hecht has declined cash bonuses each year. Recognizing that Dr. Hecht's cash compensation is well below his market peers, the Ironwood Compensation and HR Committee granted Dr. Hecht stock options, in lieu of an increase to base salary and cash bonus, to keep his overall compensation competitive with that of his peers.”*

Clearly Dr. Hecht’s net worth is heavily tied to the equity and has opted for it to be related to equity. He has decided that a lot of his net worth should be in Cyclerion over Ironwood. He must be fairly confident. 

At this point the team seems convinced, but one of them goes even further to show his conviction in addition certain board members also show conviction. Chief Scientific Officer Mark Currie on April 2nd buys 270,107 shares at $14.81 on the open market totaling around a $4 million purchase of his own money. He was the inventor of LINZESS® the revenue producing product at Ironwood. He is the Chief Scientific Officer his team created the sGC platform that Cyclerion is based on. He must be incredibly confident by the prospect of the sGC platform as compared to his prior invention at Ironwood. Two board members who are partners at Polaris Partners bought in total 626,117 shares at $16 on April 8th for around $10 million on behalf of Polaris. It does say this purchase was acquired from unaffiliated stockholders in a negotiated, private transaction.

# How do we value this

I could do a lot of guesswork at what the likelihood of passing phase 2 or what revenue they will derive from each product, but whatever I come up with it will be a lot of guesswork that I think is meaningless to try and derive a price per share through that analysis. I am in this because the team has decided their future time and net worth is better placed in a company that from an outsider perspective seems much riskier than the parent. They must feel very confident that this has an attractive future. 

I do have a price where I feel the stock could go based on the teams actions. Most of the options exercise prices are in the teens. Additionally, Mark bought around $15 and the board members at $16. Given that its a biotech company, I feel they must expect their returns to at least double. So I will give a range of $26 - $32 a share expected this year or 2020. It is currently at $8.85.

# Client Opportunity Size

Diseases they are targeting:

1. **Sickle Cell Disease** \- is a destructive disease with lifelong complications and debilitating symptoms.  
**Market Size:** Affects approximately 100,000 patients in the US. Globally, affects an average of 300,000 children born annually.
2. **Diabetic nephropathy** \- is a serious and progressive complication of diabetes that leads to chronic loss of kidney function.  
**Market size:** 160 million patients with diabetes have Diabetic Nephropathy.
3. **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction** \- Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing global epidemic with no approved therapies. HFpEF often leads to impaired daily functioning, low exercise tolerance and frequent hospitalizations.

**Market size:** Heart failure remains a rising global epidemic with an estimated prevalence of approximately 38 million individuals globally. HFpEF comprises 44% to 72% of new heart failure diagnoses. Heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in Medicare patients and represents approximately one million discharges per year.

Between 1987 and 2001, the average prevalence of HFpEF hospitalizations increased from 38% to 54%. Admitted patients with HFpEF have a 50% chance of re-hospitalization for heart failure within six months. Mortality rates over five years for patients diagnosed with HFpEF have been reported to range from 55% to 74%.

# The Catalysts

The exciting part about this is some catalysts will come very soon. Here they are:

1. Two praliciguat Phase 2 studies for diabetic nephropathy and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) on track for data readouts in Q4 2019 
2. Phase 2 study of olinciguat in sickle cell disease on track for data readout in mid-2020
3. Webcast investor event focused on praliciguat cardiometabolic programs to be held on September 17 in New York City ahead of anticipated clinical results.

I think this stock will run up on September 17th and after from the investor presentation and then will go up significantly on the phase 2 results. I will sell a good portion of my stake then if that happens, but hold some for the sickle cell results since the Cyclerion website seems to market that segment the most as if that's the most valuable part of this company. If phase 2 for Pracliguat does not go well, I will still hold for the Sickle Cell results as I feel there must be a reason management feels so good about Cyclerion’s prospects.",5,0.78,1566245448.0
t3_ctvk0i,A brief look at the Cloudflare S-1,"**So Cloudflare recently filed their S-1 and are expected to go public before the end of the year. I thought I'd take a quick look at the company and the S-1 together.**

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is a web infrastructure and security company, providing content delivery network services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security and distributed domain name server services. **These are the guys that keep websites online.**

**From the S-1:**

* Revenues of $87.1 million in the first half of 2018 to $129.2 million in the first half of 2019 (growth of 48.3 percent, year over year.) With net net loss rose from $32.5 million in the same period
* Net loss grew from $32.5 million in the first half of 2018 to $36.8 million to the same period in 2019.
* [Dollar-based net retention rate](https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/net-dollar-retention/) of 115%

I also particularly liked this from the S-1:

>Today, our network spans 193 cities in over 90 countries and interconnects with over 8,000 networks globally, including major ISPs, public cloud providers, SaaS services, and enterprises. We estimate that we operate within 100 milliseconds of 98% of the Internet-connected population in the developed world, and 93% of the Internet-connected population globally (for context, the blink of an eye is 300-400 milliseconds). We intend to continue expanding our network to better serve our customers globally and enable new types of applications, while relentlessly driving down our unit costs.

This proves Cloudflare has a strong portfolio behind it with a viable business model too and with an impact that affects millions of websites.

**A cautionary stat:**

They went from growing at 60% YoY in 2017 with an 8% Operating Loss, to growing 43% YoY with an Operating Loss of 44% in 2018. Possibly suggesting that they're going from a “scrappy startup” to “bloated unicorn” status. This may have been done to inflate stats before IPO.

To sum everything up, I really like this company, despite revenue net loss of \~$37M. They aren't bleeding money like Uber or WeWork. I can imagine many ways they could close that gap, and in fact, the ratio has improved over the last few years.

It is like not buying internet stocks in the late 1990s. All around you, you have these people who have high IQs, and they are doing it and they are being successful. So everybody from your spouse, to your employer, to the press says: ""How come you think you are so smart in avoiding this when everybody else is doing it and they are making a lot of money?"" 


And of course it creates this social proof where it works for a while. That's the great danger period in all of these bubbles.

That sort of thing, the bandwagon effect, is very hard to resist.

t3_cyj0f4,Ferrari : Stock racing ahead of value or growth ahead?,"See it also at: [https://value.finance.blog/2019/09/01/ferrari-stock-racing-ahead-of-value-or-growth-ahead/](https://value.finance.blog/2019/09/01/ferrari-stock-racing-ahead-of-value-or-growth-ahead/)

*Edit 1: I messed up by not including the subscription revenue. That makes this analysis flawed, and keep this in mind while reading this.*

*All financials are in EUR unless otherwise stated*

**Ferrari not only sells cars; but an experience – a power rush to those who want the feeling of wealth and exclusivity**. The company is at an inflection point where it scales up growth in Asia and investors have to decide whether this will come at the expense of exclusivity. Investors buying/holding today will have mediocre returns going on.

Ferrari is an Italian luxury car manufacturer which is one of the most iconic brands in the world. The company was founded in 1929 by Enzo Ferrari, to race Alpha Romeos . The company started to make its own cars in 1947, and Fiat bought 50% of of in 1969 which was increased to 90% in 1988. In 2014 Fiat Chrysler decided to demerge it from the parent and the stock has had a great run since then.

**The Business**

Ferrari’s business model is to manufacture extremely high quality cars and sell them for a premium price to the super rich. This business model allows Ferrari to have high margins, (52% gross vs industry average of 18.5%)\* and returns on capital (18% vs industry average of 5%)\*. Ferrari spends less than .5% of sales on net capex (which is far lower than the industry average of 3.3%.)\* It is safe to say that Ferrari, is an outlier in a value-destroying industry.

\*Source: Damodaran Online

The company’s large profitability can be attributed to the fact that it sells cars to an extremely exclusive club of people, and charges them an extremely high price for being part of it. The company has been helped by the tailwinds of the growth of the Chinese super-rich and a strong global economy. Buying a Ferrari is not just buying a car, but gaining entry to an exclusive club of the super-rich. **Ferrari not only sells cars; but an experience – a power rush to those who want the feeling of wealth and exclusivity.** This exclusivity allows it to exploit the envy tendency of humans, and charge a price far beyond your average car manufacturer. The company sold cars for €278,000 in 2010, and prices per car have increased every year since then. The CAGR in price per car has been 3.6% a year indicating the strong pricing power of Ferrari.

In all of 2018, the company sold just 9251 cars for an (unshockingly high) average selling price of €370,000 (US$ 411,000). The company did \~€3.42 billion in sales and made \~€826 million in EBIT which implies an EBIT margin of 24%. They sold 2671 cars in Q2 2019, at an average selling price of €362,000. 10 years after the financial crisis, with asset prices at all time highs, the super-rich seem to have had enough money to buy Ferrari cars for the past 10 years. If you have a billion dollars, and your investments go up to 3 billion, then you get a psychological boost from the increase in wealth and spend even more. This wealth effect along with the rise of the Chinese super-rich has led to a massive increase in the number of buyers who want a Ferrari. But all dreams don’t come true. According to[ carbuyer ](https://www.carbuyer.com.sg/pay-s1-216-million-and-wait-two-years-for-ferraris-ultimate-v8-coupe/)the average waiting time in Singapore (the same city where Crazy Rich Asians was set) was 6 months for old models and 2 years for new models. Ferrari does this to maintain its exclusivity.

Now where does all this get us? Ferrari is a luxury goods company with strong pricing power, low reinvestment needs and an exclusive client base. The exclusive client base implies that Ferrari is unlikely to (or even impossible to) have large increases in revenues in the developed countries, leaving us to value it as a company whose past was in the US but whose future is in Asia.

Given this discussion, we can agree on one thing: **The defining question is whether Ferrari can maintain exclusivity and grow?**

In Europe and Africa there were 4970000 HNW\*\* individuals. 3901 Ferrari’s were sold there in 2018. So 0.078% of HNW\*\* individuals in Europe and Africa bought a Ferrari. (This is imperfect, I know. But still it will do fine for estimating the Asia TAM). In the same way 0.04% of HNWs\*\* in Middle East bought a Ferrari. In Asia that number was 0.033% for 2018 and 0.029% in 2017\*\*. In other words **Ferrari is less than half as penetrated in Asia than Europe. It is far more exclusive in Asia than Europe.** The bear case for the stock is that they will dilute the brand while scaling up in Asia. This is far from true. **Ferrari can increase Asian sales by 80% and still not reach the penetration level seen in Europe**. We have answered the question in the previous question, and so will move on to the next one: **How much can they grow**?

\*\**Source : World Wealth Report*, *Ferrari 20-Fs and author’s calculations*

The answer is obvious. Given the discussion in the previous paragraphs, the answer is to sell more cars in Asia and have the penetration levels move to that of Europe/North America. This will mean an 800 to 1000 car jump depending on how much penetration goes to. If 0.05% (which is the global average of HNWs who purchased a Ferrari in 2018) of Asian HNWs (keeping HNW numbers constant) buy a Ferrari in 2020, then the company will have a 800 car boost. If it goes to European style penetration levels (0.07%) then 2700 more cars will be sold. Ferrari is obviously taking time to do this. They need time to find the right dealers and supply the cars to China and APAC. This will take some moderate capital investment, but the efforts will be worth it.

Most investors aren’t thinking of the TAM in this way. All the Seeking Alpha posts and the one Value Investor’s Club post have no estimate of the TAM in Asia. Several investors on SA and VIC have expressed skepticism that the company can go beyond the 9k unit or 10k unit mark. But as I showed before, **that wouldn’t eliminate the exclusivity by any means because the company sells comparatively very little in Asia.** Moreover the 10k unit mark is just a psychological barrier.

The next question is:**How much should you pay for this ?**

TTM 9560 units were sold. Lets assume that they grow 4% annually. The average selling price increases in our model at historical norms at 3.6%. Revenues are €5.13 bn in 2022 (in line with management’s estimate of \~€5bn in 2022.) Assuming at 25% EBIT estimate and a 23% tax rate, then NOPAT will be €.98bn or roughly €1 bn. This company deserves a premium multiple. (The standard I use for assigning multiples to companies is from Askeladden Capital’s website. See the “How do you approach valuation” section of: [this](http://www.askeladdencapital.com/about-contact/). In case you are too lazy to click I’ll paste the relevant part on Appendix 1.)

Given that they will have strong barriers to entry and meaningful potential for earnings growth, I think it should get a 20x EV/NOPAT multiple.

This translates to €19.77 billion to €20 bn in EV in 2022. Today’s EV is €27.94b. **If you bought the stock and held it till 2022, you will have got a -6.7% (read: minus 6.7%) annualized rate of return. Who wants that?**

Even with aggressive growth assumptions and a multiple at the high end of the spectrum, RACE will deliver negative returns to investors.

**Conclusion**

I agree with the bulls on every aspect except valuation. Ferrari is a great company with a great brand name, strong growth potential and pricing power. But at current prices, you will face mediocre returns.

**Appendix 1** (taken from Askeladden Capital’s website at [http://www.askeladdencapital.com/about-contact/](http://www.askeladdencapital.com/about-contact/)):

Assuming a debt-free company, this then equates to the following valuation rules of thumb: 

Undifferentiated company (GDP-like 2% growth): \~12- 13x EV/NOPAT

Company with modest growth prospects. (somewhat GDP-plus growth, say 3%): \~14 – 15x EV/NOPAT. (KFY was in this bucket.)

High-quality company with solid growth prospects. (meaningfully GDP-plus growth in earnings, say 4%): \~16 – 18x EV/NOPAT.

Very high-quality company with strong growth prospects. (5%+ growth): \~20x EV/NOPAT, or potentially even higher. (FC and ANSS are in this bucket.)

t3_czcknd,IAG Long,"International Airlines Group is the sixth-largest airline company in the world when measured by revenue. It transports ~113 million passengers annually through its five passenger airline brands (including British Airways and Iberia) and also makes additional cargo revenue (5% of total revenue). Total group revenue was £22.2bn for year-end 31st Decemeber 2018 (+6.7% YoY), whereas profits after tax were £2.6bn (+44% on an actual basis or +11% on a pre-exceptional items basis).


The business had a decent ROIC of 17.4% last year (16% in 2017), much lower than the ROE figure of 37% due to high long-term borrowings of £6.8bn (yielding a D:E ratio of 1.1), although it’s worth calling out that the majority, £5.4bn, of the borrowings is in the form of leases on aircraft.


*Where am I going with this?*


This came up on a screen I made of UK companies with high ROIC and low PE ratios. It seems on the face of it like a decent business. Plus, given its size, there should be enough analysts following this for it to be priced vaguely correctly. However, of the top 10 airline companies globally- IAG has a price to earnings ratio (2.6) of roughly half the next lowest, Lufthansa (4.91). Admittedly, it comes 7th when ranking on price to sales ratio, maybe suggesting the market expects future profits to dip much more severely than other companies.


Margin of Safety price: If the business were to grow profits at 10% per year for 10 years, with a 15% cost of capital, and assuming a future PE ratio of the median of the 10 companies, at 9.2, the business is 46% undervalued today.


Owner Earnings: starting with the £2.62bn of reported earnings and adding back on £1.11bn of depreciation & amortisation, then subtracting my £2.55bn estimate for maintenance Capex (this year’s aircraft lease agreements + the line billed as ‘engineering and other aircraft costs) and reducing working capital by £58 million as per the financial statement. This gives me owner earnings of £1.16bn and a ten-cap price of £11.6bn, 40% above today’s price of £8.29bn.

Clearly the above is a quick, initial valuation and doesn't look into the attitude from managers to shareholders, insider buying, or any comment on whether IAG can maintain its current market position, all of which I'd want to include in a more detailed analysis, but I thought I'd share to get thoughts from others and start a discussion.",5,1.0,1567552770.0
t3_czauen,Being the only active investor in a passive world,"I recently read something Howard Marks wrote about the move towards passive investing:

>""How much of the investing that takes place has to be passive for price discovery to be insufficient to keep prices aligned with fair values? No one knows the answer to that. Right now about 40% of all equity mutual fund capital is invested passively, and the figure may be moving in that direction among institutions. That's probably not enough; most money is still managed actively, meaning a lot of price discovery is still taking place. Certainly 100% passive investing would suffice: can you picture a world in which nobody's studying companies or assessing their stocks' fair value? **I'd gladly be the only investor working in that world.** But where between 40% and 100% will prices begin to diverge enough from intrinsic values for active investing to be worthwhile? That's the question. I don't know, but we may find out...to the benefit of active investing.""

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this. Even if you're able to identify market inefficiencies, how would you most effectively take advantage of them if you're literately the only active manager in the world?

I'm thinking about a valuation for a private business. I did the DCF, but I also want to apply the exit multiple method to ensure things are lining up. There is a more relevant comp set, mainly of public companies that have been taken private, that I can use after applying a private company discount factor. As the exit valuation is based on Year 6 numbers, I see two approaches:

\- Option 1: Take the exit multiple of that year's results and discount it back to PV at the discount rate, or

\- Option 2: Use a lower (but somewhat less appropriate) exit multiple to reflect the additional duration risk, and discount that back to PV at the discount rate

I think that there is a more theoretical question here is: **does the discount rate reflect the economic, industry, and company-specific risks only, or does it also reflect long-term risks of multiple compression/pricing?**",17,0.92,1567512186.0
t3_cyzlf1,"The intelligent investor by Ben Graham: 3 basic criticisms on chapter 12, per share earnings","Finished reading the intelligent investor and first of all, wow - what a powerful read by BG! Wish I had read it way earlier!

I am a CPA by trade and work in M&A for a F500. I found the content in chapter 12 on per share earnings  highly interesting. However, I was wondering if there were some limitations to his arguments in the book

Edit number 1: thanks for feedback folks. I understand this book is about value investing and my examples are mainly focused on growth. I’ve edited and bolded my post to make it more clear that intended this to be a discussion of the metrics used to determine intrinsic value from future cash flow, not growth vs value. For instance: 

**1) BG advocates for using EPS as a measure**

> while I agree EPS is a good starting point, many companies are not EPS positive and more importantly **EPS is often a poor proxy for future cash-flow**. I wonder if this limits investments in growth companies, and those which are **value cash cows** but require a lot of upfront capital (REITs, telecoms, utilities). Should the enterprising investor use additional metrics to  value companies depending on the industry or stock? Such as FFO for REITs, EBITDA - capex for telecom, etc. 

**2) BG advocates for using GAAP earnings over “adjusted” or non-GAAP earnings on the basis that it avoids excessive add-backs of “one-time” (but truly recurring) adjustments.**

> while I agree that adjustments can often be “recurring” my basic criticism with solely relying on GAAP earnings is that an investor may undervalue an opportunity because of a clearly non-routine or non-cash charge, such as tax reform in the US that lead to many corporations writing of GAAP deferred tax assets, despite the fact that taxes would decrease going forwards. Additionally, using GAAP EPS May include non-recurring and non-cash gains for a company that is selling off or carving out entities or businesses, which is hardly a sustainable business and **using this measure on a value stock could result in overvaluation.** I would suggest a better approach for an enterprising investor would be to judge the individual adjustments and determine himself if appropriate. 

**3) instead of using adjusted earnings, BG advocates using an average of several years earnings, on the basis that the non-routine charges should level out (a precursor to CAPE if you will)**

> while I agree this can be useful for cyclical stocks or stable stocks, I wonder if taking an average of historical results undervalues growth, which may be demonstrated year over year, and growth can be better vetted by using adjusted earnings. For example, it would be more appropriate to use the LTM earnings when looking at FB than the average of the last 5 years, due to the growth of the company and online advertising.

t3_czsqa4,CBL Preferred E,"On Monday, August 26th before the market opens CBL Properties a REIT owning malls files a 13D. The 13D is filed by Michael Ashner who recently acquired around 6% of CBL common shares.

Ashner has been on Pershing's board with Ackman and has affiliations with many big-name activists. 

From what I found every public REIT he has been involved with he liquidates. 

He liquidated:

1. Burnham Pacific Properties Inc.

2. Shelbourne Properties II Inc

3. Winthrop REIT

4. New York REIT

In the reason for purchase he states:

“The Reporting Persons anticipate having discussions with management and the Board of the Issuer on a constructive basis relating to the Issuer’s underperformance, overall business strategy, board composition (which include reconstitution of the Board), corporate governance, management accountability, capital allocation, capital structure and the evaluation of strategic alternatives.”

I believe Ashner will get on the board with the strategic alternative to liquidate. In order for CBL to give a cash distribution to the common shareholders in liquidation, CBL has to redeem preferred shares first. 

CBL.PD and CBL.PE are redeemable at $25. They are both attractive and don't have many differences in the prospectus. The yield is currently a little bit higher in the D, but the price is higher than the E which is why I chose the E with how soon these issues could get redeemed. 

The common is currently at $0.91. Ashner's cost is $0.94.

CBL's Total NOI for the 1st half of 2019 is $293,953,000 annualized that is $587,906,000. 

As of June 30th, CBL has a total share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt of $4,416,058,000 and preferred with a redeemable worth of $626,250,000 so a total of $5,042,308,000 to cover.

According to CBRE, the mean power retail cap rate is 8.45% with the C class segment (or worst class malls) having a mean at 9.86% for the 1st half of 2019. (A power center is a large 250,000 to 750,000 square ft. outdoor shopping mall that usually includes three or more ""big box"" stores).

CBRE has neighborhood/community retail at a mean of 7.48% with the C class having a mean of 9.19%. 

CBL has both property types of power and neighborhood/community

The common shares outstanding as of June is 173,473,000.

The common shares are around zero in value at an 11.65% cap. $587,906,000/0.1165 = $5,046,403.43 minus the amount to cover $5,042,308,000 = $3,901,433.48/173,473,000 shares is around $.02

At the C class mean of 9.86%, the common shares are worth almost $5.3 a share. Valuing them at the C class level is likely unfair because as per the financial supplement for June 30th 41% of the mall NOI or 36% of total NOI (total includes office, self-storage, or smaller retail) comes from Tier 1 malls that have increased sales per square foot as compared to a year ago.

At the power retail mean of 8.45%, it's $11.04 a share.

This leaves a decent amount of breathing room for the preferred in liquidation. They would have to deviate around 320 basis points from the retail mean and 179 basis points from the C class mean.

The preferreds even have more breathing room than that though because mortgage debt is on the asset level. This means that as long as the best assets cover the credit line plus senior notes which have a total balance of $2,230,244,000 as of June 30th and the best properties individuals mortgages then the preferred will be paid. The others they can default on and the balance will not have to be paid by preferred or common holders. Many properties have no mortgage debt. 

One strange thing in Ashner's 13D is that from the moment he initiates his position he buys shares every day the market is open beside for two days. July 10th and July 11th he pauses buying and that is where the stock reaches its highest point in his time frame of buying of around $1.20. If he thinks he can liquidate this thing at those supposed cap rates why should he care about saving around 10 - 20 cents? I don't know the answer, but the pattern makes me scared of the common because he may believe its more likely to liquidate at something like $4 or lower. 

The reason why the stock is so low is not only the sentiment on retail but the fear of CBL breaking the covenants on their very sizable debt. 

Their credit line and senior note covenants that investors are worried about are: 

1. Total debt to total assets: < 60%; 

2. Secured debt to total assets: < 40%

3. Total unencumbered assets to unsecured debt: >150% 

With the NOI declining quarter after quarter, some believe the asset values lowering will cause them to be in default soon.

I believe Ashner has done his homework and feels he either has a replacement for the credit line or CBL has enough time to sell enough properties to pay the line off.

The preferred has much less risk for the possible scenarios where he exists his position, where he is wrong on timing, where he loses a proxy fight for control and where he cannot sell at high enough prices all while having a potential return of around 260% when redeemed at $25. With the preferred E, we get paid $0.415 a quarter to wait vs the common at this moment has zero dividends.

#### Catalyst

Ashner issues a proposal to shareholders saying his estimated liquidated value on the common. The higher the better.

Ashner gains control and redeems preferred by selling properties.",14,0.95,1567640160.0
t3_czl81l,The Big Short’s Michael Burry Explains Why Index Funds Are Like Subprime CDOs,"I'm a passive investor, with a 30 year retirement horizon and regardless of the answers to this question, will likely keep investing in the typical SP500/total bond index funds using dollar cost averaging because I buy the Graham/Buffet argument of the US growing in the long run and don't have time to be picking stocks all day with real money.

t3_d5frlr,Best of the Best plc,"BOTB

Best of the Best plc is an online gaming company with essentially one game- players pay around £1 for entry to guess where a football (that has been photoshopped out) should appear in a photo. A panel then also guess where the ball should be and whoever guesses closest to the judges wins the prize- mostly luxury cars, but they've expanded into some other luxury items. The shares are currently at 285p, giving a market cap of £26.7 million.


Historically, the business has operated mostly out of airports and shopping centres, however, realising that focusing on their online business provided higher margins, over the last few years they have shut all physical locations.


I believe that BOTB is significantly undervalued based on earnings potential without having to forecast more than 3 years ahead. I believe this potential is a side-effect of top-line and earnings growth being hampered by the steady closure of physical locations, combined with the lack of institutional following of the business. The average growth rate of online revenue for the past 4 years has been 30%, whereas the total business revenue rate was only 14%.


There are a handful of tailwinds and a few downsides I would call out:


Pros:


•50% of revenues, and 80% of visits come from mobile. Despite this, BOTB doesn’t have an app. They plan on introducing one, which should provide a substantial uptick in engagement of their returning customers.


•Management owns 72% of the outstanding shares. I have faith that our interests would be aligned.


•One of my worries that the business would go overboard on digital marketing given their newfound online-only business structure. Undisciplined expenditure on digital marketing would more than offset the benefits of the higher-margin online activity. In the strategic report however, cost per acquisition vs. lifetime value is called out as a key business metric.


•The margin used to forecast future earnings assumes that margins stay the same as the average of the last few years. Given that the switch to online-only was done due to this segment of the business being higher margin, there is significant upside here.


•The company did a tender and bought back £3.5m of shares at 485p. Given the high management ownership of the shares, I suspect the board would have only taken this action if they felt the share price was fair value. Given only positive results since then, it's unlikely they have reduced their internal valuation for large-scale buybacks.


Cons:


•The skilled game element of the customer interaction means the business is not regulated. Regulation changes could eat into profit/revenue.


•The undiversified product mix is particularly susceptible to competitors.


Assumptions used:

•Cost of capital = 15%.

•Share buyback rate of 1% per year (in line with previous years).

•PE and PEG range calculated using share price 52 week high & low for each FY 15-19.
•After tax profit margin (vs revenue) of 10.8% used (average of 2015-19).

•3-year weighted average revenue growth rate used for PEG calculation to smooth out the denominator.


Using 2015-19 FY, the median low PE (FY earnings / 52 week low) was 9.6, compared to the median high PE of 27.4. Similarly, for PEG ratios the medians were low = 0.7, high = 1.7.



Valuation

•2019 Actuals: £14.3m online rev., earnings = £1.76m, margin = 11.9%

•2020 Projection (+30% rev): £18.59m, earnings = £2.01m, margin = 10.8%

•2021 Projection (+30% rev): £24.17m, earnings = £2.61m, margin = 10.8%

•2022 Projection (+30% rev): £31.42m, earnings = £3.39m, margin = 10.8%


Assuming a PE of 27.4, the median of the last 5 years 52 week highs and a cost of capital of 15%, the present value of the future 961p stock price would be 632p, giving more than 50% discount on today’s 285p price.


Using the 52 week lows median for the future PE prediction gives a future price of 337p or a present value of 221p.


It seems unlikely that the PE ratio would trade at the lowest end of the recent historic range, given the earnings growth rate is likely to double from 15% to 30%.",5,0.86,1568720623.0

Are there some major derivatives being played in the equities market tied to index fund that could hypothetically cause an index fund bubble?

There’s a famous note by Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett called the “Dumb Pipe Paradox” that states that the best outcome for shareholders might be for cable companies to become disintermediated by internet-based media, and to give up trying to play the content game and just provide connectivity. Implications, in cable, at least:
- Revenues fall significantly
- Operating expenses fall even more
- OCF falls modestly but OCF margins improve
- CapEx falls dramatically
- FCF grows
- Capital employed also falls dramatically, yielding better ROI and ROE

# SGH: Two Stories – One Truth

SMART Global Holdings, Inc. (SGH:US, “**SGH**”) relied on its subsidiary SMART Brazil for 62% of its 2018 revenue. This revenue was only possible because of a tax incentive for which SMART Brazil no longer qualifies. We show that management was not clear with investors about the grave risk Brazil posed to continued SGH profits before it happened and, even more appalling, did not adequately update investors after it happened on July 1, 2019.

SGH management still has not been clear about the severity of the adverse events in Brazil. Our extensive analysis and on-the-ground due diligence in Brazil and India reveal that SGH’s new strategy and recent acquisitions won’t replace that lost profit margin.

One recent SGH acquisition, InForce, had been owned by two SGH directors and Chairman/CEO Ajay Shah, who personally profited $5 million from the deal. Moreover, according to Indian filings that we pulled, SGH paid $12 million, or over 13x sales for this de minimis business that appears to be only accretive to insiders rather than shareholders. This related-party transaction puts a spotlight on Shah’s complete control over SGH. He is Founding Managing Partner of SGH’s controlling shareholder, Silver Lake Sumeru, which with Silver Lake owns over 40% of SGH shares. Shah also sits on one of the two boards that oversee Silver Lake Sumeru’s investment.

SGH’s short life post-IPO can be characterized by aggressive leverage, asset stripping, and cash sweeping, dumping the husk onto public markets. Crippled by the loss of the subsidy in Brazil, SGH is no longer smart money.

* SGH built its SMART Brazil business on a Brazilian subsidy for local tech, providing SGH customers tax benefits up to 28% of gross sales, allowing SGH memory to sell at a premium to international prices. Without the subsidy and with no other advantages, SGH cannot compete head-to-head in the global commodity memory market.
* In June 2019, Brazil released details of its new subsidy program. Under it, SMART Brazil can’t earn its OEM customers enough points to qualify. We have uncovered meetings and statements demonstrating that SGH knew the dire impact of this change but has not been clear about the gravity of it with shareholders.
* As a strategy re-direct, in 2018 SGH acquired Penguin Computing; it has high fixed costs and low operating margin of 6% (1Q18). This raised SGH costs and diluted its margins. In July 2019 SGH acquired Artesyn Embedded Computing and Inforce Computing. This was a step backwards, as in 2010 SGH had shut down its embedded computing subsidiary.
* The related-party Inforce acquisition turned a $12 million profit for SGH executives, with $5 million for Ajay Shah himself. SGH disclosed little about the deal. Shah is CEO/Chairman of SGH, founding partner of Silver Lake Sumeru and a member of the board that oversees Silver Lake’s investment in SGH. Silver Lake and its affiliates own 40% of SGH shares.
* SGH is practiced at murky disclosure. SGH shows KiWan Kim in California as President of SMART Brazil. But in Brazil and according to filings there, Rogério Nunes is its CEO/President. SGH doesn’t mention him in SEC filings, but we discovered Nunes has held full control over SMART Brazil since before SGH bought it 17 years ago. Omitting to disclose key-man Nunes allows SGH to conceal his compensation and any SGH share ownership/sales, or potential conflicts of interest. Nunes is director of two trade associations that lobby the Brazilian government, and he founded another that seems laser-focused on SGH interests in Brazil, sometimes against Brazilian interests.
* The failure of SGH to immediately disclose the impact on revenue of the lost subsidy, its failure to provide details of the InForce related-party deal, its concealment of key-man risk in Brazil and his failed lobbying to save the subsidy, all starkly reveal management’s indifference to good governance through their lack of clarity to shareholders.
* Silver Lake and its affiliates have already extracted much more from SGH than they invested to buy it. Since the IPO, 2017, they have sold over $270 million of stock. Meanwhile, executives have been doing the same: their $26 million of sales since the IPO compares to just one open market purchase.

t3_de7p7i,Focused Research on Value-Investing: Best Information from Greenwald,"I see many people trying to find information and resources on the subject of value investing. It is interesting that everyone mentions the titles of books and websites. However, I have decided to lend you all the easiest method of discovering how to value these companies. Everyone says ""read this book"" but nobody mentions exactly where this insightful material is inside of each book or website. What is the point of this post? Focus. The most insightful part of Greenwald's material is inside of the lecture below.

**Focus:    Search on YouTube,    ""*****Greenwald 2010 Lectures: Lecture 4*****""**

Replay it until you absolutely understand the adjustments without having to look at the lecture. This lecture makes it feel like you are literally sitting in his class. Moreover, he goes over the reasoning behind each action. I see many people claiming to be value investors but they never explain their method of adjustments. A lot of the same buying businesses that are undervalued crap. They never tell people why. The reasoning behind each adjustment is important because it will adjust your value immensely. You can go from thinking you have an undervalued business to buying an overvalued business. One little mistake can obliterate your capital.

Lecture 4 is where I got most of my knowledge on this subject. Much of the other material that people give out are reiterations of the ""Value investing methodology"". It is the same thing over and over again about buying undervalued businesses at a low price. However, Greenwald's lectures are phenomenal. Unless you go into a value-investing class, you will not understand the full method. That is, until now. We have the lectures online for free and it is up to you to do the extra work. Regardless of the visuals on Greenwald's lectures, the commentary is astonishing.

I believe our community should shift into finding the reason why for their adjustments instead of the whole ""I buy undervalued businesses"" lingo. I am not a guru by any means, but I do understand that a portion of the community is in search of valuable information. Valuable information that dives into the reasoning for adjustments and industry knowledge is where we should focus. Overall, the lectures inside of those classes are great but I think Lecture 4 gives the best reasoning.

&#x200B;

If anyone has additional specific information on adjusting metrics in value-investing, focused industry knowledge, or videos that are helpful for understanding certain businesses, please add them to the discussion.

Best of luck to you all,

t3_deyuyg,Long KHC Pitch,"I've included the crux of my pitch on KHC  below. You can find the detailed report in this [LINK](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mqjru2elfnur5ns/KHC%20Investment%20Thesis.pdf?dl=0). 

I'm using this pitch for interviews so welcome all constructive criticism. 

**Recommendation: KHC has never been about topline growth given meaningful underperformance vs. peers. Rather, we believe the company has room to support core EBITDA margins of \~27% vs. consensus at 22-23%. We see favorable risk reward in KHC (up 45% /down 20%) driven by supply chain deflation, manageable leverage, positive earnings revisions and a sizable valuation discount vs. peers.**

**Investment Thesis**

§ **Supply Chain Deflation.** KHC has seen \~$700m of EBITDA pressure over the last 18-months from supply chain inflation. These issues should start to reverse over the next 6-12 months, given freight, overtime labor, and packaging costs are deflating Y/Y.

**Relative Valuation.** KHC trades at a \~25% discount to Diversified Food peers on the back of legitimate, albeit addressable concerns. At current level, KHC trades at 10.5x consensus 2020 EBITDA vs. our implied 9.9x estimate, largely driven by the potential for positive earnings revisions. There is also scope for this story to re-rate higher (not our base case), but will be predicated on executing on the margin front. 

**Visible Path Towards Delevering.** Net leverage remains relatively high at 4.9x vs. the peer group at 3.5x. We believe leverage targets of 2.5-3x are likely not achievable in the near-term, but do see a credible path towards leverage of 3.9x by 2021, driven by \~$4.5bn of disposals (Maxwell/Ore Ida), 50% dividend cut, and cumulative FCF of $7.6bn (consensus). 

**Incremental EBITDA From Mondelez:** The 10Y license held by Mondelez for Kraft and Lunchables branded products outside of the US is expiring in 2022. We see the potential for an incremental \~$170m of EBITDA to flow to Kraft in 2022-23, which consensus estimates exclude. 

**Key Risks**

**Margin Weakness Continues.** Further deterioration of EBITDA margins given \~500bps of erosion over the last 3-years. Management has spoken of further investments (marketing/media) to ignite topline momentum. We think continued supply chain misstep and ag inflation could lead to further margin weakness in the near-term.

**Dividend Cut.** KHC cut the dividend by 40% during 4Q18 earnings to support FCF. The dividend yield stands at a whopping \~5.5% vs. peers at 3.2% and 200-300bps over its bonds. We view the possibility of a dividend cut as a credit positive and supportive of de-levering actions, given management has repeatedly noted its commitment to IG credit rating. 

**High Yield Downgrade.** Net leverage stands at an industry high of 4.9x, while plans for asset disposals are temporarily on hold. Credit rating agencies have stood behind IG ratings, although stable/negative outlooks could deteriorate into HY category. CDS spreads and term structure spreads are pricing in a downgrade to HY, but we think this is premature given a visible path to 3.8x net leverage. 

**More Goodwill Impairment.** Goodwill/intangible (\~$85bn) is still 2.3x KHC’s market cap, despite taking $16bn of impairment YTD. While it’s difficult to estimate when another impairment charge could materialize, we think another $11bn of charges is possible. However, this would be a non-cash charge, excluded from core EBITDA/EPS, and not affect credit metrics. 

**Catalysts**

**SEC Investigation.** The SEC launched an investigation into KHC citing accounting issues. The investigation is ongoing, despite voluntarily restatement of historical numbers, given supply rebate irregularities. Any resolution will likely be well received. 

**Additional Asset Sales.** Although on hold for now, KHC was considering divesting some underperforming assets. We think additional asset sales would temper credit rating downgrade expectations. 

**Unveiling Strategic Initiative.** New management is formulating a plan to drive better execution on growth, margin expansion, and strategic initiatives. As such, this announcement could come as early as February 2020 and could clear up a lot uncertainty.",12,0.72,1570535452.0

t3_dftqhl,Aging population problem,"So I was watching this video https://youtu.be/ErUQnd-YFGg about how japan's economy is fading because of the aging population, and it got me thinking about how this affects the value investor.

At the moment there are multiple countries in the west facing this problem. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age)

All over the west the natality rates are falling and with those the ability of all companies to grow is becoming increasingly hard, atleast by my logic.

Fewer people to work and buy these products mean less money are being circulated into the economy, while the shifting median age means the priorities of your average man are changing.

Following this line of reasoning, and because an investor should never buy into a company that might force him to sell out of necessity, I think many markets that are considered extremely safe now might infact have some serious underlying problems that are really going to be shown in the next 20-50 years. Housing markets and everything being consumed by the young adults such as Netflix and Facebook.

My question is, do you think this is a real concern facing an investor? And if so what bussinesses do you think are more robust to these upcoming changes?",22,0.78,1570687398.0
t3_dgh0o4,United Natural Foods,"This is a curious name I've been kicking around lately...I'm not quite sure what to do with it yet, but thought it'd make for an interesting discussion. I'm new to this industry and this is just about a days worth, so excuse any errors. 

UNFI is a leading distributor of organic / natural foods. They are the exclusive supplier to Whole Foods under a contract expiring in 2025. Whole Foods historically was about 1/3rd of the Company's revenue prior to the 2018 leveraged acquisition of Supervalu which diversified the Whole Foods exposure down to \~15%. Pro-forma for Supervalu, about 23% of sales are to independent markets, 17% to Whole Foods and Whole Foods-type retailers, 60% to conventional retailers, and the small balance to other vendors. 

Distributing organic foods used to be a pretty good business because 1) the organic foods industry has strong secular tailwinds and 2) organic foods did not fit the conventional food distribution logistics model for a variety of reasons that can somewhat be summarized as a combination of shelf life and de-centralized sourcing (farmers, local producers, etc., not traditional CPG suppliers) and as a result commanded a slight pricing premium over conventional distributors. 

The secular shift towards natural foods has been strong enough for conventional distributors to revamp their logistics and start to make inroads into the specialty market, and their large scale (Sysco, U.S. Foods, etc.) allows them to offer competitive pricing. So a race to the bottom is currently taking place. Gross margins on the organic side typically range around \~12% while more conventional is \~9%. Operating costs are mostly fixed - salaries, transportation, fuel, etc. - which is problematic particularly in low unemployment environments like today. This all comes together and gives you razor thin EBITDA margins in the LSD range.  

UNFI completed the acquisition of Supervalu in late 2018 and levered their balance sheet with $2.8 billion secured bank debt, plus another $1.3 billion operating leases capitalized at 7x. LTM EBITDA is $563 million against revenues of $21.4 billion for the same period. Net of interest, taxes, capital expenditures, and uses of working capital the Company burns free cash flow. 

Consensus estimates for the Company over the next several years call for modest cash generation, but this implies gross margin to only deteriorate by \~33bps driven by minor penetration of conventional retailers into the revenue base. 

I guess if I am starting to form a thesis in my head...that seems a little aggressive and it feels like these margins are going to continue contracting more to the \~9% I mentioned earlier. In fact, gross margins of \~10.5% will put the Company into negative EBITDA territory (!). Maybe \~11.5% is a more realistic goal post? That will get us $215 million EBITDA although the Company will still burn close to $200 million a year on that. 

Another interesting data point is the lean cash balance the Company runs with...around $40 million which is very small relative to their revenue base. Liquidity here primarily comes from availability on an asset based revolver secured by most of their inventory. If margins keep contracting, this may lead to a write-down of their inventory which makes me wonder how that may affect the ABL borrowing base calculation - it could squeeze liquidity real quick. 

As of the most recent 10-K they currently operating 63 distribution centers, and from what I understand there is a fair amount of overlap between legacy UNFI DCs and Supervalu DCs which will be consolidated. Since they own a lot of these the proceeds from consolidation will go towards debt pay down. The Company says they may get about $1 billion after they've completed selling assets...I just don't know if I believe that. I probably need to do more work on the total distribution foot print of all food distributors in the country to see if there is an overcapacity issue. If there is, they certainly won't get values high enough to total $1 billion. 

Given this context, it probably wouldn't surprise anyone to learn that their stock is trading at \~$7, down from $13 in September which is down from \~$50 in summer 2018. Their $1.8 billion term loan due 2025 trades at \~72 for a \~13.5% yield. 

I'm just not really sure what to do with this. These issues look pretty structural to me which I don't think they can reverse, so the stock is probably a short, yet I don't really see a good catalyst. 

For the same reason, I don't really want to buy the loan right now unless there is a way to force bankruptcy and preserve value. The debt is cov-lite so there aren't any maintenance covenants that can get the ball rolling here. 

One might suggest shorting the stock and going long the loan, which is a trade that doesn't necessarily disgust me, its just the catalyst issue. Asset sale cadence is probably the key here? Another issue with the loan relates to collateral, but that is a separate issue. 

I really don't know, but these are my thoughts. It'd be great to discuss if anyone else has thoughts on this or could point me in the direction of any good industry white papers on how food distribution works.",18,0.88,1570808769.0

t3_dieqdf,I'm a total amateur and need some second opinions am I looking at a potential fraud?,"**Background:**

A friend of mine knows I'm interested in fundamental research of companies I started doing this on my own a few years ago and he mentioned that one of his good friends had told him about a Canadian mining company called CRUZ COBALT CO. it's a penny stock mining company purportedly with 7 Cobalt projects 5 in Ontario, 1 in Montana and 1 in Idaho. So I wanted to look into it as he bought it on the advice of a friend and it's headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, which from what I’ve heard is the mecca for securities fraud because in Canada, there is no federal securities regulator and the BC provincial regulator is the weakest of them all.


**Management Team**

The management team per the company's [website](https://cruzcobaltcorp.com/about/management/) consists of three men [James Nelson](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/James-Nelson-09V9WZ-E/biography/), [Seth Kay](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Seth-Kay-0B0N8D-E/biography/) and [Gregory Thomson](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Gregory-Thomson-06Z62C-E/biography/). They also list a woman named [Cindy Cai](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Cindy-Cai-094W62-E/biography/) as their CFO. Digging around I found out she is the CFO of two other small mining companies and has been the CFO for at least 11 companies since 2010 all of them in the energy or resource exploration business what a busy woman! Here are all three mining companies websites, anything look familiar? 
[Cruz Cobalt Co.](https://cruzcobaltcorp.com/) l
 [Sienna Resources Inc.](https://siennaresources.com/)
l [Spearmint Resources Inc.](https://www.spearmintresources.ca/).
 

From the shields in the top left corner to the page layout they look to be nearly copies of each other. In addition Gregory Thomson is a Director for all three and James Nelson is President, CEO, Secretary and Director for Cruz and Spearmint. 

**Company Offices**

If that isn't at all interesting click the contact us tab on each of the websites and notice they all have the exact same head office at Suite 1470, 701 West Georgia
Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V7Y 1C6. They also share a PO. Box 10112 Pacific Centre and in their annual reports it states that both Spearmint and Cruz's registered and records office are at 900 – 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 3H1. Meanwhile Sienna's registered and records office is far away at 800 – 885 West Georgia Street. All three share the same auditor Davidson and Company LLP.

**Auditor's Going Concerns**

In each of the latest annual reports the auditor expresses “material uncertainty related to going concern” essentially saying they are not sure whether each company can stay in business because “(Cruz) had a working capital of $3,063,030, had not yet achieved profitable operations and has an accumulated deficit of $15,875,374 since its inception”. Spearmint on the other hand “At January 31, 2019, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, incurred a net loss of $768,576 during the year ended January 31, 2019 and has an accumulated deficit of $3,551,251 since its inception”. Finally Sienna “had a working capital deficiency of $401,206, had not yet achieved profitable operations and has an accumulated deficit of $22,122,639 since its inception”. 

**Share Issuance**

In the past 2 years alone Cruz has issued $7,351,159 in shares, Spearmint has issued $1,671,200 and Sienna has issued $2,405,000 in shares. None of these companies seem to be doing anything other than raising more money.

**Another Red Flag**

Looking at the other companies the main players have been involved with I found out Gregory Thomson was a director of a company called Copper Road Inc. which last filed an annual report with the SEC in 2007. One of the directors who was his peer was a man named Kelly Fielder, when looking up Kelly I found this delightful [article](https://biv.com/article/2015/01/convicted-stock-promoter-still-hasnt-paid-fraud-vi)
 
**Conclusion**

I see a lot of weird relationships and questionable actions but I’m a complete noobie so I was wondering if y’all who are more experienced and sophisticated could tell me. Did I just stumble onto a potential fraud? Or is this unusual behaviour just how small companies in the mining sector behave? I would love to be wrong about this and tell my friend he did not buy a scam. All criticism or corrections are welcomed. Thanks for reading.

t3_dielti,Some realities of the distressed debt market to be very aware of,"Some realities of distressed debt market and how the participants can engage in legal theft from widows. I will speak in general terms.  I would also love to hear from people in the distressed business about what goes on.

I think the reality of investing in distressed debt is that there are many parties who seem to be out there to fleece minority bondholders of their money and do it in bankruptcy court. Let’s look at each of the parties and what often happens.

&#x200B;

1. Distressed debt funds – In my opinion, many are super sleazy parasites (even ones with good public reputations). They  will fleece minority bondholders left, right and center often in the following ways:

&#x200B;

1. The  addition of new capital at favorable prices (often discounts to already low valuations) that may only be available to select investors or because of the purposeful murkiness of the disclosures only select investors take       it up.
2. Big fees for backstopping new capital (rights offerings, new share issuances, etc.) again often only available to large creditors in the club.
3. Other.

The Distressed debt funds could easily end up extracting 10% or more of a company’s value through these tactics above the capital they put in.  The plan of reorganization valuations should be fair value – not low balled. The backstop fees should be compared to market put prices of other public companies because companies needing capital are essentially buying puts from capital suppliers. And the NUMBER of shares distributed to various claimants should be clearly disclosed (often they are not which is nuts.)

&#x200B;

1. “Professionals”      – Lawyers, Financial advisors, etc. Perhaps thousands of documents filed and millions of fees from the      corporation – and for what – to overcomplicate something that when it comes down to it can often be summed up in a very simple manner that take existing claims that are restructured to new claims. Even that is not laid out in a simple      manner in 1 page with the essence of the business transaction clearly laid out at the end. The fees are super      high and they may not even be hired if they will not structure a transaction to fleece minority bondholders that would benefit the big distressed funds. The big  distressed funds are likely hiring the creditor committee lawyers and financial advisors anyway.

&#x200B;

1. Management: Often takes a big stake in the company      in the form of equity in Key Employee Retention Plans. You can imagine how “key” they are if      they were the same management team for many years whose decisions led the      company to be some variation of badly run, over leveraged and      inefficient. They will likely get a big stake worth many millions for essentially getting the company through bankruptcy and not for stellar performance. I think there may be a quid pro quo with the large stakeholders to both take as much as they can and ignore the rights of minority bondholders.

You can’t always count on bankruptcy judges to be fair as they might miss something in the purposely convoluted and overly complex, unclear and murky plans and disclosure statements. I would recommend the judges use the power of equitable subordination much more aggressively when these distressed debt funds are engaged in bad behavior trying to fleece minority shareholders.

So watch you butt if you invest in distressed debt and expect the big funds to do highly unethical things. If these types of things happened in equities investing there would be an uproar regarding minority shareholders rights but because this area is so murky it is difficult and complex to figure out (intentional is my guess).

Solutions:

Perhaps there is room for a disruptive legal firm that could take market share by short cutting and simplify the process and documents filed that is 25% of the cost and significantly less time for everyone to read, etc. The number and size of filings could be reduced significantly while keeping the business and legal substance. This would be a huge savings for everyone.

And about them taking from widows – very often widows will own some of these bonds either directly or indirectly through a bond fund and the distressed debt funds, “professionals” and management, in my opinion, are engaged in legal theft from them. Imagine many years from now and you are lying on your death bed, as a participant in this sector did you make the world a better place from your actions?

t3_djh70c,Sensitivity Analysis // Statistics Perspective vs. Finance Perspective,"I always believed that in finance sensitivity analysis was, at it’s core, about optimization, you generally had a range of two values (like different sale prices and different units sold) and you tried to find what combination of those two values would yield the best result (most profit).

In statistical references though, I've concluded that they seem to be referring to something slightly different. They are concerned about which of multiple independent variables seems to have the strongest effect on the dependent variable, holding all things equal.

In short, they are more concerned about isolating a variable to test it’s importance on the dependent variable, relative to the other independent variables in the model, rather than about how independent variable interaction led to a specific outcome in the dependent variable.

Is this correct? Can anyone confirm on the statistics side? Or am I overlooking a concept?",26,0.9,1571367187.0

Other opinions, argue that, yes, it bears some resemblance to the past, but that 2019 is very different from 1999 and 2000, and that banks and investors have matured enough to dismiss the type of ludicrous deals that took place two decades ago.

What is your opinion? What do the numbers say?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: My opinion is that it's a different era, and that there is much more skepticism over companies who can't produce results and profit. There are some that are still in limbo, and so that's why we haven't seen them fold. I also think they've been around for longer, and still show ""potential"" promise, as opposed to some of the mad ideas that were supposedly ""business"" concepts in the past, but really only lined the pockets of the wannabe moguls who peddled them as soon to be lucrative and successful ventures.

t3_dnjgkm,Is this insane or am I just behind the times re enterprise saas valuation?,"Please read this excerpt from a pitch of an enterprise saas company. Is it just me who thinks these valuations are insane, or are we really in a saas bubble but pretending not to know it?

*""Our 5-year DCF produces a $34 PV utilizing a 26x EV / EBITDA or 7.5x EV / Revenue LTM terminal multiple on our forecast and a 10% discount rate.  Also, the DCF factors in the $120m+ worth of acquisitions conducted in 2019 YTD.  But otherwise, the Company is FCF positive given the SaaS nature of deferred revenue inflows.* 

*We utilize a public enterprise SaaS comp set of over 60 names.  Those growing topline mid-20s and above are currently trading at 10-20x 2020E EV / Revenue.  Utilizing 10x on our 2020E revenue estimate yields a $30 stock price (we are forecasting 29% y/y growth in 2020E).*

*Lastly, one could value the non-enterprise self-serve business and enterprise segment separately.  For a low growth yet highly profitable and stable self-serve business, 7-8x EV / Revenue feels appropriate (given the higher than average profitability).  For the hypergrowth enterprise segment that’s currently doubling y/y, we could utilize a 16x EV / Revenue in line with the median of high growth self-serve comparable peers (TEAM, WORK, ZM, TWLO, SMAR, DBX, ADBE).  Over time as growth decelerates, the forward multiple should be taken down.  On a consolidated basis, this implies \~10-11x consolidated EV / Revenue ($30 PV), which again is at the low end of the peer range.* 

*Lastly, the FCF support is what really attracts us as value investors.  Theoretically, if the Company were to “turn off” its S&M spend, it could produce 40% FCF margins immediately.  At normalized profitability levels for what would still be a \~10-15% topline grower, you are paying close to \~20x EV / FCF for a very high-quality asset that’s growing nearly 3x faster than the market yet at a similar, normalized valuation multiple.  At the very least, this asset deserves a premium to the market, which is what makes this a great value play too. ""*",2,0.76,1572122526.0

I'm a long time real estate investor and financial products professional who began investing in a few areas across the litigation funding space.

t3_dn72ej,Scrounging the Canadian oil microcap world to find a 50+% FCF yield stock," I’ll be honest, I don’t know if there’s another catalyst for this stock except value, but at this point it’s so ridiculously cheap it’s hard to imagine it doesn’t go up in the near term. Full disclosure, I can’t buy it because I’m restricted due to my job. Also means I haven’t done enough diligence to make a decision if I were to buy it.

Hemisphere Energy is a microcap Canadian producer with waterflood assets in the middle of nowhere and it is not remotely a hot asset. However, they’ve recently tripled production with near zero declines (declines have actually been negative in the past few months). Insiders have slowly been buying, and the stock hasn’t moved in three years (admittedly outperforming the rest of Canadian energy). The company is currently messaging excess cash will be allocated to repurchases, but given the nature of management teams in the industries I will never hold my breath on that. They repurchased a pretty immaterial amount of shares in August thus far. 

FCF yields assuming $18 Canadian diffs and a 1.33x exchange rate are (FCF yield on Mkt cap, EV):

$55 – 77%, 23%

$50 – 38%, 11%

$45 – -1%, -1%

$60 – 116%, 34%

$65 – 155%, 46%

This assumes a $10 million capital program to keep production flat, although that’s very conservative considering low declines (sub 15%) and a $15 million capital program has thus far added 700bbls a day consistently. $18 WCS diffs is also pretty conservative in my mind given that WCS diffs have been much tighter with curtailments in Alberta, and Maya trading at a premium or par to WTI. I expect these to stay once pipe capacity is online in Canada with enough pipe capacity expected in mid 2020 to sustain current Canadian production with no new pipelines needed (though I do anticipate pipelines will be built in the near-mid term). 

Closest example of a transaction I know of is Cardinal Energy’s 3,000 bbl/d acquisition of waterflood assets in Midale in SE SK. The purchased them for a valuation of $400 million. They were widely criticized, but even if you take a 75% haircut to that given where stocks trade today vs 2017, and assume the actual value is $100 million, that would represent a 4 bagger.

Production expansion is low risk. Each production well only costs $800k CAD meaning you’re not spending $10 million to find out the NPV doesn’t work. There’s some risk they try to drill a ton of step out wells and it’s a disaster. I haven’t talked to management, but it would be a question for me for them.

**Risks**

\- Management’s cash flow plans. I have literally no insight into this currently. The biggest risk to me is they decide to expand somewhere else in Canada unproven (Montney or Duvernay) or try a waterflood that fails miserably elsewhere. Their assets are likely too small to be bought. 

\- Recession – the company is pretty levered. $30-$40 WTI means it’s probably a BK, but that’s true of pretty much every oil company.

\- Operational issues – The waterflood could stop working. I don’t see why it would, but it’s a possibility.",20,0.89,1572052880.0

t3_duaz9i,Uber employees vs independent contractors," Hi from Portugal,

I've been following the Uber political situation, regarding independent contractors vs. employees, and I'm thinking that it might not be that bad of a situation for the company.

If Uber is forced to treat the drivers as employees, wouldn't it have some kind of power to demand exclusivity from them (in Portugal that is the standard in any contract, but I'm not sure how it'd work in the US and the ROW)? If they can demand exclusivity through contracts, I'm thinking that that's where their network effects become exclusive.

Up until now they have more drivers and users, but since the drivers can also drive for other companies, that network has little effect for Uber. But if the drivers have to become exclusive (with all the added costs that brings), won't Uber be in a excellent competitive position in the markets where it has a dominant position, through lower waiting times and some economies of scale?

Thanks.",18,0.78,1573389773.0
t3_du93gc,I can't get the flow of this logic by Michael Burry,"Hi. I am reading Michael Burry's security analysis on a firm called ""Senior Housing"" but I don't think I am capable of interpreting this reference in the paragraph below: 

In fact, if we assume that **rents approximate mortgage payments** – which is not true but is ultra-conservative, then during the first quarter of 2000, the bankrupt operators generated $80 million in accessible cash flow before interest expense, depreciation and amortization. This is significantly more than the **rents paid to Senior Housing**. So while the general perception is that Senior Housing just took over money-losing operations, this is not so. It is true that while the bankruptcy proceedings go through approvals, Senior Housing will be lacking it usual level of cash flow. But this is temporary. Once resolved, cash flows will bounce back, possibly to new highs. The bankruptcy agreements provided for operating cash flows to replace rents starting July 1, 2000.

&#x200B;

The part I can't really understand is the sentence in bold italic. 

1. **rents approximate mortgage payments** 

Doe it mean rents this firm is earning is ordinarily lower than mortgage payments?

But why does he pick mortgage payments to estimate rents in the first place?(sorry I think it might sound like a dumb question)

I tried to read the quarterly report of this firm, but it didn't really mention ""mortgage payments item""

Anyway he says this sentence right after that:

2. **rents paid to Senior Housing**

But I don't know how the two facts are connected logically. (rents- mortgage payments - rents paid to senior housing)

With my poor knowledge I think that he tries to say rents are estimated through mortgage payments and if he deduct expenses from this number, then it's bigger than the rent???(that's where my brain stops.. :( )

t3_du6tgm,Long GME (Gamestop) - Feedback Appreciated :),"I’ll try to express my core points about GME – feel free to critique any of my conclusions / statements. Hopefully my analysis has provided some evidence that the mean value is around  $10-$20 per share. I'll start by explaining the progression to the mispricing of $6.09 today from a more reasonable $12-$15 earlier this year.

Gamestop hired Perella Weinburg to explore sale w/ Apollo and Sycamore as two main suitors in early 2019. Talks fell through as a vague statement - “GameStop’s Board has now terminated efforts to pursue a sale of the company due to the lack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquiror”. This implies that Gamestop got into the final talks with Sycamore or Apollo, and one of them wasn't able to perform a leveraged buyout to the degree they expected - a small misstep which resulted to where we are at today. Note this would have been anywhere from \~$15-$20 earlier this year.

A subsequent removal of their ""high yield"" dividend by the new management team (expected given their method of compensation - long-vesting options and other equity that is negatively affected by a dividend) resulted in a sharp share price drop, from $5 to a bottom of $3.21 after a tender offer with >40% proration factor. Given that Gamestop's institutional holders were full of dividend related ETF/index funds/mutual funds, this constituted a massive forced selling process, not to mention the 75% of the market cap short we have gotten to today pushing the price down (highest in the market as of October 2019).

Next, we will discuss the multitude of misconceptions that have pushed the price down and balooned the short interest

Misperception - Gamestop has a big sales problem - who shops there anymore?

Gamestop’s SG&A has been allowed to saturate above gross profit levels consistently for a full 7 year console cycle - causing operating profit compression. Since the last console release (end of 2013), Gamestop's SG&A has been allowed to bloat with corporate overhead / non-incremental expenses. Excluding double digit gross profit declines in 2017 and 2019, gamestop's gross profit has actually been flat (-1% to 5% annually).

Misperception: SSS / Preowned Declines Will Flip Margins

Gamestop’s New Management is aggressively cutting unprofitable (\~5-10%) stores, and taking advantage of the short term lease profile discussed later. SG&A & Operational Efficiencies of 200m by the end of 2020 exploited widen the operating profit margin from 12.8% to 24.3%. This is very achievable by mgmt considering they have completed 40m out of 100m guided in their first quarter (Q3) and guided up this level to 200m by the end of 2020. Late Stage in 10 year console cycle & confirmation of disk drive in both big console releases next year will stave off gross profit declines temporarily.

Misperception: Gamestop is the next Blockbuster

BlockBuster was saddled with high interest debt, maturing in 2009/2010 (900m), and were unable to refinance during the financial crisis. BlockBuster also had razor thin margins and high interest payments well before their bankruptcy in 2010. Despite aggressively cutting SG&A, store count only fell from \~9000 to \~6500, suggesting long operating lease durations prevented a more rapid scale-down.

As stated by the former Blockbuster CEO - ""With $350 million in debt that was due in the first quarter of 2009. It was something Keyes wasn’t worried about because he was planning to refinance the debt at a later date. But now, with banks unwilling to lend, and nervous movie studios changing their credit terms from 90 days to cash, Blockbuster had only one option."" Note: Gamestop instead has a net cash position!

Misperception: Radioshack is the next Blockbuster

Radioshack did not close stores with \~4300 stores in the U.S. in 2015 and in some instances 25 in a 25 mile radius (Sacramento, CA). This is due to a poor loan with strict covenants on closing stores. Extreme management issues, considering 7 CEO changes from 2005-2014 with aggressive marketing & reinventing spend for each new charlatan. 6.8 m in executive comp in 2009. SG&A stayed flat to up despite rapidly declining gross profit, no cyclical aspect of their business decline (like the console cycle with Gamestop).Indemnification Contracts removed accountability from the new management teams, and made them poor stewards of Radioshack investors' capital.

Misperception: Xbox Live / Playstation Store (Streaming) Risk

Digital Games are already a well-baked in trend, but there are structural discounts to buying physical -> resale value / unique offerings. Furthermore, multiple studies show that >60% of console gamers prefer buying physical. For example, FIFA 20 retails at $60, and FIFA 19 has a $9 value on Gamestop trade-in or $12 on eBay (structurally higher due to the time/cost requirement of packaging and shipping on the part of the seller). Since next years FIFA 21 should yield a similar trade-in value for FIFA 20, this presents a 15-20% structural discount in buying physical, and redeeming the game upon the next release.

Gamestop is wisely praying on exclusive digital items with their new management team, like the ""Fornite Merry Mint Pickaxe"" with epic rarity, requiring consumers to go to a Gamestop location and purchase a collectible (driving same store sales). This move presents a large opportunity, and has been also repeated with a ""Free Legendary Shiny Pokemon"" for Pokemon Sun and Moon and 3 free Cowboys Madden Ultimate Team players in Madden 20.

Another common statement by short investors - ""I haven't been to Gamestop in forever - they must have fallen into irrelevancy"". Nevertheless, Gamestop still holds 36.3% of console sales in the U.S. with 2.725 B out of a 7.5 B market. Although this market share is not suggestive of a moat - it is interesting to see how consumer's have still chosen Gamestop despite the long-ingested trend of Amazon & rival retailers such as Best Buy entering this near-commodity space.

Additionally, weak numbers such as a 40% drop in hardware sales seem to only lend fault to Gamestop vs. their competitors. A quick look at statistica's useful charts on PS4 and Xbox One sales show a severe freeze-up in these console sales since Dec 2018 - a similar effect to what we saw in 2013 before these consoles were released. Consumers tend to stop buying consoles once they hear a new console release is within a year in horizon - in this case Xbox Scarlett 5 - both confirmed in Holiday 2020 (also both have disc drives!!!). We've seen this rapid cyclicality before, but the market thinks it's all secular this time around.

Gamestop's management has hinted at an almost complete closure of their international stores (>1200), with direct rumors of closings in the entire Greater-Nordic region this year (\~300 stores) and further evidence in their most recent conference call. Digging into their Milan, Italy and Brisbane, Australia distribution facilities, both could fetch \~97.8 per square foot (the price Blackstone is paying on average), indicating that the sale of these facilities could provide Gamestop with another 30m in cash.

Management also seems very promising - sticking to their word in cutting SG&A aggressively as many activists have urged. They are already about 20% completed (as per conference call) of a 200m sg&a overhead cut, a seemingly routine operation for George Sherman. Digging into conference calls at his time in Advanced Auto Parts, the stock rallied almost 142% during his tenure due to a laser-focus on operating profit goals - stating that he will ""chop"" intently to meet targets.

New operating lease standards force Gamestop to put >700 m of new ""debt"" onto their balance sheet, forcing EV numbers up and causing retail / systematic selling from investors using formulas/multiples blindly. Confusion around EV seems to permeate through VIC / seeking alpha. Nevertheless, the average operating lease duration is only 2 years, and mandatory lease payments following an almost exponential distribution. The real question is should this ""debt"" with zero incremental interest payments (already included on the income statement) and a 2 year duration be treated as debt? I would disagree, especially considering the store closures we will see from management and the fact that these ""operating lease debts"" resemble accounts payable rather than long-term debt.

Additionally, most of the big/popular console games are very demanding in download size - try 92 GB for read dead redemption 2. Many consumers either don't want to wait for that mega-download on their console or simply don't have the bandwidth.

Gamestop also has a massive short squeeze opportunity. With >400 m in cash at the bottom of their working capital cycle, 75% short interest (short shares / shares outstanding), and a volatile >30% cost to borrow which peaked over 100% on interactive brokers for some periods. An existing 237m auth may be being employed as we speak, but with a meager 550m market cap, this presents a massive opportunity for management if they play their cards right. I have faith, given they already employed a dutch-auction tender offer and it aligns with their incentives to employ their buyback plan aggressively, and have already stated and acted as they will not blow away their cash.

Finally, the recent offers for Vitamin Shoppe and Chico's (two low-margin retailers with similar store profiles) both resulted in 10, 11% FCF yields per store respectively. Note: this is eerily similar to a $20 per share for GME offer that could have been fulfilled earlier this year by Sycamore / Apollo at a 11% FCF yield per store. Although the Chico's offer was turned down by management, a $20 offer today would make the stock a 3.3x today - even so the news has been relatively good this year - for example consoles were confirmed to have disk drives and come out in Holiday 2020.

I hope this provides more clarity on GME - even very conservative DCFs yield around a $7.5 per share outcome without the short-squeeze hypothesis (10% discount rate, small improvement in FCF due to console release, then 20% gross profit declines thereafer). I'm not trying to say Gamestop will make a great comeback, but a measured decline (unlike the behaviors of Radioshack's management) will be extremely accretive to the equity holders today.

Catalysts:

Share Repurchases (237 m authorization, 63 m of which was already used in a dutch-auction tender offer)

Short Squeeze (highest short interest in the market, high cost of borrowing emerging)

Buyout (Revisited by Apollo / Sycamore or some megafund alternative)

Rebound in 2020 due to the new console releases driving not only hardware but software sales

Forterra: An Unloved (Small Cap) Name Embarking on a Structural Growth Story

49.0% blended upside

I explore the story of a fundamentally sound UK pureplay masonry product producer who boasts a high ROE, a solid balance sheet and demonstrable fiscal discipline (with an ESG angle).

The well-founded company continues to generate healthy free cash flow and generate superior dividend yield versus peers, whilst maintaining strong earnings growth and expansionary initiatives.

The name has built a moat through a series of strategic M&A (its heritage London brick constituting 25% of all UK brick stock) and stands to benefit from secular headwinds (namely, top-down government addressing of the housing deficit, benign demographics and an easy credit 'lower for longer' environment).

Domestic politics and economics have embedded a gloomy discount into the sector (as consensus' negative thought-linearity calcifies), and unfortunate floating conditions sits Forterra at the bottom end of peer valuations (despite pack-leading performance). This has created a compelling contrarian value opportunity.

t3_dx8rdj,CCLP (Natural Gas Compression) Long (Bonds/Equity) Thesis - Feedback Appreciated :)," CCLP presents an opportunity to receive a >30% unitholder yield in mid/late 2020 onwards, whereas similar competitors USAC and AROC pay 12.4% and 6.8% distributions respectively (Although USAC is paying a distribution beyond their distributable cash flow). Once debt is paid down slightly in order to refinance, LPs should see a 2x to 3x in price per unit once a dividend is resumed / a buyback plan takes advantage of the underpriced shares in 2020.  


Market's Wonky Valuation of Compression Sector  


The demand driver for compression leasing firms is the volume of natural gas being transported through their compression infrastructure, yet the market values them according to the price of natural gas / oil. After the 2015 oil crash, the compression industry took a hit partially due to fears of counter party risk and outflows from the general U.S. energy industry. These declines in stock prices created a reflexive effect - many of these firms such as Archrock (NYSE:AROC), CSI Compressco (NYSE: CCLP), and USA Compression (NYSE:USAC) relied on the MLP model of distributing LP units in order to fund growth capital expenditures tied to acquiring more compression equipment. These firms had the incentive to try to maintain high dividends in order to support their share prices, using almost all (or even more in some cases through debt funding) of free cash flow for distributions. When share prices fell, managements took to cutting distributions - which caused the share price flywheel to spin further. Cuts in distributions immediately alienated yield-hogs chasing after MLP dividends, since Mr. Market (blind ETFs, mutual funds) like consistent, high dividend payers in this sector, which further pushed the price down.  


A quick peek highlights the affect of indexing on these compression companies - they trade in line with the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF (XES) although their cash flows do not. Since XES is tied directly to the price of oil and oil / energy sentiment, this can push the companies whose cash flows are not affected by these factors out of line (like we are seeing with the compression industry).  


The four primary compression leasing firms - AROC, USAC, Kodiak, and CCLP -- have formed an oligopoly as customers do not shop around for price on compression equipment, and customers prefer to be consistent with their leases throughout a natural gas extraction site. This results in high returns on invested capital (20% annual ROIC) tailored with a rebound in the natural gas industry, especially in CCLP's prime market in the Permian Basin.  


Compressors from AROC, USAC, and CCLP are generally leased on one year fixed fee, cash based contract, where the compressors have a meaningful delivery, setup and breakdown cost typically born by the lessor. Average compression placement time in any one location tends to be about 3-4 years, so the contracts are typically renegotiated year after year, with the compression company having the flexibility to hike the leasing fee. Thus the cash flows involved resemble medium-term infrastructure assets, rather than the more volatile cash flows of your typical oil service firm.  


Opportunity in CCLP  


CCLP currently pays the minimum distribution of a penny per unit, equating to a meager 1.74% forward dividend yield. This almost entirely alienated CCLP's shareholder base that previously enjoyed the companies yield hovering \~10% per annum. Also, Debt / Equity and other similar ratios have painted a fictitious picture of the companies financial situation, since as share price fell these ratios skyrocketed - although the equity drop was overblown.  


Previous management of the company also pushed for a non-stop, unsustainable dividend which forced them to rely solely on LP unit sales for all growth capital expenditures, and a small pull-back in natural gas volumes in 2015 and other effects above led to the flywheel explained earlier which has brought their market capitalization to almost 100m today.  


CCLP, obeying GAAP rules currently depreciates their compression infrastructure over about 12-15 years on average (Section 179 deductions bring that down into the 7 - 10 year average range). Thus, we can see that their depreciation expense is greatly overstated on their P&L, reporting 74m in depreciation LTM but with management commentary citing maintenance capex around the 20m mark. This creates a stark contrast from competitors USAC and AROC, with typical depreciation periods hovering around 20-25 years. Additionally, the over-depreciation of CCLP's equipment has led to a reduction in tax expenses, but has falsely represented the tangible book value of the company.  


Additionally, earlier this year a variable-weighted average price (VWAP) preferred share debacle was rightsized, which gave the GP (Tetra) far too much to gain and led to the firing of CCLP's CFO. These preferred shares were promptly closed out, but the >50% drop in LP unit price was preserved. The firm had also unwisely on a significant amount of leverage since 2015 to try to maintain their falling distribution, with a current EV / EBITDA ratio of 5.2x.  


""During the midpoint of our full year, adjusted EBITDA guidance of $127.5 million and after accounting for approximately $40 million of cash interest expense, $20 million of maintenance capital expenditures and $3 million of taxes. We expect to generate approximately $57 million of distributable cash flow""  
\-CFO Q3 Earnings Call  


Currently, in terms of capital allocation the management spent $30m earlier this year to redeem their preferred shares, and is guiding for <50% of that pool towards growth capital expenditures that produce a >20% ROIC. These capital expenditures and a slight rebound in natural gas volumes have been extremely accretive, with only around 26 M in distributable cash flow in 2017 to 57 M today led by a >50% increase in gross profit since 2017.  


This leaves the company with around $30m annualized net of growth capital expenditures which it currently is planning to use to pay down debt to their target 4.5x ratio. This is meaningful, as they plan to refinance their 2022 long-term debt at a lower rate, reducing interest payments. Additionally, the debt trades below par, at around 88.75 with an offering price of 98.5 presenting a large opportunity for the company to repurchase debt at an advantageous price. Thus, since debt trades significantly below par, and EBITDA is rising quickly due to increases across the sector for compression equipment, they should be able to reach their target ratio some time between Q2 2020 and Q4 2020.  


After refinancing their debt, management explained how they plan to resume distributions and possibly repurchase shares if shares stay at such a low level. We can find evidence supporting this statement due to management / GP (Tetra) having the most to gain from a dividend, since they own >30% of the common units themselves, and have been following through on their recent statements.  


If management were to redirect 30m of their distributable cash flow (not including any increases in EBITDA, which are very likely given growth capex) after refinancing to dividends at the current share price, this would effectively produce a 30% dividend yield at the current market capitalization around 100m. This is why we believe that CCLP is a 2x or 3x as Mr. Market, loving high-dividend payers, should prop the LP unit price at least to a 10-15% effective yield.

t3_dyovtl,Who would Bluerock's Total Income+ Real Estate Fund be suitable for?,"Here is the Schwab report - [Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund](http://www.schwab.wallst.com/cgi-bin/upload.dll/file.pdf?zac877c0az822e4991db7e46f39b19cf6252b3723a) \- underlying investment details all date back to March 31, 2018, but fund performance (as of Oct. 31, 2019) shows straight-line growth of $10k at roughly 7%. Consistent yield of 5.25% for at least 5 years. Morningstar provides the same info, and gives the top underlying holdings.

I work on a team and am challenging this choice.

This is a closed-end fund-of-hedge-funds, and all underlying holdings are opaque. Normally, there would be accredited investor eligibility requirements, but this fund skirts that issue. I have been in frequent contact with the sales team asking for details on how the fund's value is calculated - since it has no correlation with anything - their short positions, and a breakdown of their high fees of >2%. They are not providing me with any answers.

In general, US commercial real estate seems to have a recognizable downside correlation and a weak upside correlation with the S&P 500. While absorbing the multiple perspectives of economists and analysts, US real estate has remarkably high valuations with relatively low rents resulting in a low cap rate (the yield on commercial real estate investments). US real estate valuations grew in a similar trajectory as the FRB's balance sheet grew during the periods of QE between 2009-2015 before growth stagnated, and then it stalled in 2017, possibly coincidental with the FRB's shrinking of the balance sheet.

Meanwhile, this fund shows a straight line trajectory of growth that I expect would be impossible to maintain with changes in the CRE market.

As for the fund company itself: the CEO of Bluerock, Jeff Schwaber, was Executive VP of Behringer Harvard (REIT) until he was replaced after the REIT was buried in scrutiny and lawsuits after dropping in value by nearly 97%. When my team met with him, it was exactly like speaking with the typical ""product specialist"" from any other fund company. It was wholly uninspiring.

I'm looking for more ammo to challenge this with, but I am open to being persuaded otherwise if this is a sound investment that I just don't understand. I am also interested in having more questions to come back at them with.

\- ***Amartya Sen***

In the [previous part](https://pradyuprasad.wordpress.com/2019/11/25/the-bear-case-on-india-part-1/) I had shown that the demographic dividend is actually a demographic dud. We will have no “dividend” if half the country does not participate in the workforce. But what happens to those enter the workforce? Are they skilled enough? And will they get jobs? I’ll answer these questions in this post. I am going to argue that the Indian workforce has a large skill problem with university degrees being close to worthless, and a rapidly growing share of the educated unemployed.

Such is the state of education in India today. We have two distinct phenomena: a group of you Indians, who will grow up know know how to do basic arithmetic, along with an educated group who cannot find jobs.

See image here: [https://imgur.com/a/Db6cUQu](https://imgur.com/a/Db6cUQu)

This graph shows unemployment rates by education level in India. The striking part of this graph is that graduates has an unemployment rate of around 15% right now, while those with no education have unemployment rates of close to zero. This shows the main challenge in India: we have low quality graduates and this will make the demographic dividend ([which isn’t all that great as shown in the previous post](https://pradyuprasad.wordpress.com/2019/11/25/the-bear-case-on-india-part-1/)), less effective and unlikely to drive economic growth at all. In fact we will be seeing the exact opposite of the conventional prediction that India’s demographic dividend is its greatest benefit.

The exact opposite is happening. Millions of “educated” Indians (though fewer than expected by the UN) will enter the workforce with degrees of poor quality, face unemployment or at best underemployment.

**How we got here- The abysmal state of primary education**

See image: [https://imgur.com/cQp9EMf](https://imgur.com/cQp9EMf)

ASER reports that only 43% of 14 year olds in India could divide in 2018. This was 44% in 2017, similar in 2016 and has been declining since the peak of 75% in 2006. What is happening is India is facing the results of decades of underinvestment in education. The World Bank estimates that the average Indian gets only 5 years of education adjusted for learning. In comparison the average Chinese gets 9.7, Brazilian gets 7.6, Russian gets 11.9, American gets 11.1, British gets 11.5 and South Africa is lower at 5.1. Clearly if we want to be in likes of China, the US or the UK, we have to get the primary education system in order. India has the highest ambition to education ratio in that list.

For a country that is supposed to be the next economic superpower, India is doing an extremely poor job at educating its young minds. This isn’t a one off that happens at one level. The rot in the education system is reducing GDP growth in the long run.

**Secondary education has its problems too**

Just like their younger siblings in the primary education system, secondary students have poor learning outcomes. In the latest National Achievement Survey the NCERT found that in only 6 educational boards (out of 36) more than 20% of students could pass a basic mathematics test. Those 6 were the CBSE a central government curriculum, the ICSE a curriculum made by the Council for Secondary Education in India, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, and Odisha. Let that sink in for a moment. In only 6 education boards out of 36, more than 20% of students could pass a mathematics test for their age level (class 10/15 years old). How can India become an economic superpower when its human capital formation is so poor? **How can a country where the majority of students cannot do basic math become a developed country?**

See image: [https://imgur.com/5qzKaAr](https://imgur.com/5qzKaAr)

**The rot spreads to the tertiary level**

The thesis of most India Growth Story enthusiasts is that there are many smart people who will get jobs, and contribute to society. It is evident that few of the people who will enter the job market are skilled given that \~56% of 14 years olds in India could not divide in 2018, and the majority of 15 year olds (87%) could not pass a math test for their grade level. India do not have a skilled workforce. To make things far far worse, tertiary institutions are doing a poor job of moving the workforce from unskilled to skilled. The blame does not fall on them though. Given the input quality they can be cut some slack.

But even with what they have, they are doing very poorly. A [survey](https://www.aspiringminds.com/thankyou/?url=2602) by the consulting firm AspiringMinds revealed that only 3.84% of engineers can write compilable code, only 36% of them do an internship and only 7% of them do more than one internship. Even for jobs that require low skills compared to the others like a BPO associate 60% of students are unqualified. For a country that has a mission of Digital India, these are pathetic statistics. Colleges emphasize theoretical skills over practical ones, are not incentivized on quantifiable learning outcomes like jobs and incomes and therefore are close to useless in skilling the country

**Conclusion**

The India Growth Story is falling apart job by job, step by step. While economists predict a rebound in FY20, don’t let that fool you that long term GDP growth in the country is severely constrained by these factors.

You can see this on my blog at: [https://pradyuprasad.wordpress.com/2019/11/25/the-bear-case-on-india-part-1/](https://pradyuprasad.wordpress.com/2019/11/25/the-bear-case-on-india-part-1/)

Here's why (same text):

Some famous international investors like Prem Watsa and Mohnish Pabrai have bought into the India Growth Story (IGS). I feel that the IGS is overhyped, and projections of India becoming an economic superpower are unlikely to happen unless major policy and cultural changes are in place.

When Prime Minister Modi was elected in 2014, there were projections that he would be India’s Thatcher or Deng Xiaoping. These projections have been untrue. Economic growth in the country has slowed down with Q1 real GDP growth being at 5%, compared to 7.1% in 2018, and 8.2% in 2017. Unemployment according to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy a private sector company is 7.5% compared to 5.9% in 2018 and 5% in 2017. Worst of all, real consumption appeared to have declined by 3.7%, for the first time in 40 years according to a [leaked report](https://thewire.in/economy/consumer-sending-fall-rural-demand-nso-report) from the government.

India optimists like [Bill Gates](https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-has-potential-for-very-rapid-economic-growth-says-bill-gates/articleshow/72094025.cms) have said that the country has significant potential and can get millions out of poverty in the next few years. I disagree. I think that India is headed for stagnation of growth in the long run and the current slowdown is just the first step in it.

**The contents of the IGS:**

The history of the IGS can be traced back to a [2003 paper by Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/archive/archive-pdfs/brics-dream.pdf) and a [2000 analysis by the Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/india-rising/). It said that with the right policies, India would be a country with \~$3500 GDP per capita in 2030 and $8124/capita in 2040.

Most proponents of the IGS believe that in the next 30 years or so India will have high (>8% real economic growth), will be an economic superpower with a billion and more consumers. This amazing country will benefit from a demographic dividend, from the [10 million Indians](https://cse.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mehrotra_Parida_India_Employment_Crisis.pdf) entering the job market every year who will find jobs, spend, save and invest. Another part of this story is that there will be massive fixed investment in roads, bridges, and others which will lead to more economic growth. I will now take down the first part of the IGS: the labour myth.

**The labour myth: Jobs, people (and the lack thereof)**

It is no secret that India is having trouble creating jobs now. Over the last year unemployment has shot up to 7.5% from 5.9% a year ago. The government attempted to hide this by stopping the release of the NSSO labour survey before the elections, which was leaked to the media.

A big part of the IGS is this:

1. Indians will enter the work force
2. Get jobs
3. Spend that money.

**People? What people? It’s only men here**

Indians are not entering the workforce. In most developing countries, labour participation rates are between 60 and 80%. The 75th percentile is 67% LPR, and the median is 62%. But India is at at a low 51% (the 13th percentile) with its neighbors being Gabon and Suriname. None of the GS papers or the Brookings piece anticipated this. In a country full of young bright educated (or so they claim) youngsters over half of them stay at home and chose not to go to work.

See this photo: [https://imgur.com/a/vYPOJdS](https://imgur.com/a/vYPOJdS)

The standard objection to this is that India’s young are educating themselves.They are building human capital for their future and so this should be excused. This shall be shown to be untrue later in this post series. The lack of participation of Indians from the workforce is not equal across the genders.

**Almost 79% of males in the working age in India chose to look for a job, but only 21% of females do so.** The male participation rate is within global norms but the female labour participation rate falls laughably short. In fact the only countries which do worse than India in this are Egypt, Morocco, Somalia, Iran, Algeria, Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. It is worth noting that 3 of those countries are undergoing wars -Yemen, Syria and Iraq, 2 of them have mass protests against the government – Iran and Egypt and Somalia has a joke of a government. India is among the **worst** globally here. But why does this indicator matter? After all who cares about this number?\*

I think you should, if you care about the health of the Indian economy. If India were to have normal (\~40%) labour participation rates with average incomes ($1900) each then there would be at least an approximate 156 billion USD\*\* (6%) boost to the economy. Moreover around 80 million women are sitting at home when if we had better education, and social norms that allowed for it. You don’t have to be a radical feminist to see what a waste this is to the economy. There are 80 million women at home, not working. They would if they were born in the US, Germany or Taiwan.

**You should care because the demographic dividend may not even happen if half the country isn’t participating in it. The projected ‘dividend’ isn’t happening** **if half the country doesn’t work.**

\*If that doesn’t piss you off enough, here’s this: Pakistan beats India by 1 percent. It has a female labour participation rate of 22%.

\*\*\*\*My analysis is an ESTIMATE. This is a back of the envelope calculation. I’m not an economist.\*\*67% of India is in the working age (15-64). That is 897 million people. 48% of these are women. That is 430 million women. Only 21% of these chose to participate in the labour market. That means that there are 90 million women in the labour market today. I’m going to assume they ged paid the per capita GDP rate which is 1900 USD. Which means if these women earn the average income, they earn 171 billion USD. If more (\~40%) of women participated then we’d have 170 million women in the workforce. If they too get paid at the same pay they’d get make 327 billion USD. This is 156 billion USD more than what they are earning now. The India economy is 2.59 trillion USD. 156 billion is 6% of that. And this doesn’t count for the multiplier effect from the spending, the fact that women usually spend more on their children (when given cash transfers) which means a higher long run growth rate, and the social effects of this (lower family violence, lower birth rates).",41,0.82,1574855024.0

The interpretation of Trump’s “better to wait until after the election” for a China trade deal comments is that the Hong Kong human rights bill sponsorship by POTUS has clearly caused agitated the Chinese side (plus this morning’s Reuters report stating that the White House is considering kicking Huawei out of the US banking system), and in conjunction with the narrowing window to act on the Dec 15th tariff “fill or kill,” **is likely incentivizing monetization of of the +9% gain made in S&P since early October via profit-taking in recently Options- ($Delta still 94th %ile since 2013 even after yday’s selloff) and Futures- (Asset Manager S&P Futures $notional position currently 99.6th %Ile since 2006 at $141.7B) positioning “extremes.”**

*This “extreme positioning” into a dynamic where traders are incentivized to monetize into year-end—especially ahead of the Dec 15th “tariff risk”—has been at the core of my view over the past few weeks that there was a local / tactical “window for a pullback” into late November (start Dec ain’t bad though).*

As such, this risk-off dynamic is driving the bid in Rates / USTs (*Reds and Greens +6 to +8 ticks, while we’ve seen Real Money and Central Bank buying flows in the front-end—thus the “bull steepening”),* which too then will almost certainly result in a reversal later today of the US Equities factor dynamic experienced on Monday (Momentum down, Value up); instead, **today’s UST rally will then dictate a resumption of the “Momentum” bounce-back experienced over the past 3 weeks, as longs in “Duration” Equities (“Min Vol” Defensives and “Secular Growth”) are set to rally, with “Cyclicals” are likely to again fall.**

Touching on my constant refrain over the past two years—that being where a “macro shock” then acts as catalyst for Dealer Gamma “flip” and / or in conjunction with a Systematic Trend deleveraging impulse—we see a mixed-bag, as our **Nomura QIS CTA model shows the majority of Equities futures positions remain “in trend” and ABOVE estimated deleveraging / “sell” levels.**

What does it tell us?

The Gamma of an option measures the rate of change of the option delta. Its' number is denoted relative to a one point move in the underlying asset. For example, if the gamma for an option shows 0.015 with a delta of 0.45 then a full point move in the stock (i.e. 35 to 36) means the delta will move to 0.465.

Gamma is calculated via an option model such as Black and Scholes or Binomial. The value is the same for both call and put options.

The Gamma of an option is important to know because the delta of an option is not constant; the delta increases and decreases as the underlying moves. Because delta is essentially our position value in the underlying, the gamma therefore tells traders how fast their position will increase or decrease in value vs movements in the underlying asset. 

In other words, Gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset. So, watching your gamma will let you know how large your delta (position risk) changes. 

**Since the chart above shows us high gamma for strike prices between 3095 and 3155 it tells us that the SP500 can get very volatile around these trading ranges. Its like playing with dynamite throwing it back and forth until it explodes.**",60,0.98,1575399498.0

t3_eb25ry,Is timing the market really that bad in times of high PE ratios?,"The phrase ‘it’s about time in the market, not timing the market’ gets thrown at novice investors a lot.


I completely agree with the sentiment- the stock market trends upwards and with dollar-cost averaging, you don’t need to worry too much about getting in at the wrong time. That being said, after seeing a chart in Tony Robbins’ book Unshakeable which showed that putting in your capital as soon as you had it available had greater historic returns than dollar-cost averaging, I decided to do a quick bit of analysis myself. I’ve used the S&P 500 and the Shiller PE ratio to measure returns and PE ratios and have looked at the following hypothesis:


In times of high PE ratios, waiting for the market to revert closer to the average ratio results in high returns than investing right away.



I’ve considered the strategy that if the Shiller PE ratio were to reach 25, the potential investor holds off from purchasing until the ratio drops back below 20.


There have been three periods since 1928 when the Shiller PE reached 25: between 1928-1930, 1995-2007 and 2013-2019. The time period for which the ratio was above 25 represents 18% of all trading days from 1928 onwards.


To measure the difference in returns when waiting for lower PE ratios, I’ve assumed the investors would have withdrawn their money on the same day whether they had invested when first planning on doing so, or waiting for lower PE ratios. This means we can measure the difference in returns by just looking at the percentage difference in the buy price.


On average across the days when the PE ratio was above 25, following this strategy provided a mean return 23% above just buying on the day. The strategy outperformed buying straight away on 71% of the days.

Whether or not we think this strategy is one to employ today I suppose depends on whether you think the market will crash to a more normal Shiller PE range (dropping below 20 today would mean buying stocks at a 34% discount), earnings will increase such that you end up paying more than today to achieve a lower PE ratio, or something in between.

Even if earnings stay steady, they're well above the 10 year average and the Shiller PE would slowly adjust downwards of stay steady as the stock price climbs.

I’m keen to hear the thoughts of others here and whether you are currently buying the S&P 500, looking for cheaper stocks internationally or just waiting for a rainy day.",8,0.76,1576432832.0

t3_edt0zo,Trying to ferret out a Ponzi scheme- I have a couple of questions,"I was recently offered the “opportunity” to invest in a “hedge fund” that I am 99% certain is a Ponzi scheme.  It is a fund that purportedly has been averaging a 15% return MONTHLY for the past 18 months.  They claim that they have a proprietary algorithm for trading cryptocurrency that allows them to do this.  I am fairly familiar with crypto, and the information I was sent was just a wall of technical gibberish that I think was meant to either intimidate or impress the reader.

I’m certain enough that I am thinking about filing an SEC whistleblower complaint.  My questions are thus:

1) is there a way I can definitively look up this fund to see if it is even actually registered as a fund?  I’ve found a few sites that have search functions for hedge funds, and the name of this fund didn’t come up on any of them, but I have no way of knowing whether all funds would be included in those databases.

Searching for information about the fund is complicated by the fact that they cleverly named it in a way that google results are nearly impossible to sift through- I’m not going to name the fund, but for example imagine if they named it “Quarterly Earnings”- searching for “quarterly earnings hedge fund” is going to give 99.9% noise in the search results.  I would appreciate any info anyone has about how to search for a fund and see if it even actually exists.

2) Regarding filing an SEC complaint- is there any reason I would need to use a lawyer rather than just filing it myself? It’s an online process and looks straightforward.",58,0.9,1576951176.0
t3_ef2duh,Analyzing Life Insurance companies in growth markets like India and China,"Hi All, I am looking to analyse Life Insurance Companies in growth economies (India, China etc.) and facing with the following challenges

1. Since the products are long-tenor, accounting is completely opaque as high acquisition costs are expended right away instead of amortizing over life. How should one see P&L profits here?
2. Sell-side is valuing this business by projecting value of new business (VNB) and giving a multiple to it - However, the VNB calculation is rather strange as it calculated as PV of cash flows of new business written that year discounted at risk free rate. It seems to me that cash flows should be discounted at cost of equity (and not risk free rate) to come to VNB. What is the right framework?
3. Life Insurance companies don't talk about ROCE, ROA - how does one say if this business is good or bad without knowing its capital efficiency?
4. Various types of products have different capital requirements - how does understand which is the most lucrative product?
5. Would be great if someone could share material on evaluating life insurance business (books, papers, primers)

t3_efwu7j,How are security analysises in IBs incentivised?,"In my understanding, security coverage is often a paid service from a company. Why are companies interested in paying for this coverage? Does it happen that the company and investment bank is splitting the commission for trades going through the given bank? Or is it just because the company want to see their company trade at a higher volume? I honestly can't tell what is contributing to the analysts monthly salary as they are not part of the corporate finance department.

Also, it looks like banks having corporate business going on with a company have security coverage in addition. Is security coverage often part of the ""investment bank package"" when companies come to IBs to receive capital?

t3_egef40,"SMSI: An under covered microcap software company, part 2.","Hi folks,

I wanted to do a very quick review of SMSI as it’s share price have dropped meaningfully since my last write-up with no fundamental change for it’s business, and I believe it now offers an extremely attractive price for a growing software business.

I covered SMSI in a recent [blog post](http://willowdalepartners.com/index.php/smith-micro-software/) prior to their Q2 earnings. At the time SMSI was trading at $3.20/share (May 25, 2019). Shortly after Q2, their stock doubled on strong earnings report but have since pulled back after Q3's earning report on no great reasons. I believe this is a once in a blue moon opportunity to buy into a robust recurring revenue generator growing at FAANG speeds (40%/yr) while at an extremely attractive price.

This will be a quick update note as a couple things have changed in favor of investors over the last few months.

**A brief Intro of SMSI:**

SMSI has 3 primary products (apps):

SafePath: an app that comes in 3 different set of functionalities. SafePath Family is a set of features that allow it to control, connect and track other phones with the app installed, primarily marketed as a family safety app, very similar to Apple’s “Where’s my phone” app, but with more features which I won’t cover here. The second and 3rd set of functionalities (SafePath IoT & SafePath Home) allows this app to control and connect to other devices like trackers, smart watches, security cams, etc. If you’ve used the Google Home app, SafePath works in a similar way (although with a different UX and more features). Between SafePath Family, Home, and IoT (all 1 app, just marketed as 3 separate feature sets) SMSI positions this app as a single device management app that allows users to connect and control smart devices they have around them (phones, trackers, cameras, TVs, etc). SMSI sells this app via partnerships with major MSO and carriers, who then resells this app as a rebranded white-label product to their own phone subscribers. I.e., SMSI partners with Sprint, who then sells this app to Sprint’s customers. Sprint charges 7/month, they split the revenue.

Commsuite: a voice to text app, but with more features but again I won’t cover those here, basically work similarly to Google Voice. Also sold via carrier & MSO partnerships to these carrier’s end customers, just like SafePath. Both Commsuite and SafePath obtains MRR as they’re subscription services like Netflix.

ViewSpot: a new app SMSI acquired last year. It allows you to configure a phone to only show specific content (a sandbox). If you’ve ever had the unfortunate experience of turning on your Windows laptop in “safe mode”, this is similar to it. This app is sold to retailers and carriers and used by these retailers and carriers as a sales agent. Carriers install this sandbox app on their display phones and tablets with pre-configured content (like the display phone’s key features, pricing, etc) primarily to help sell the display phone. SMSI receives recurring subscription revenue from their carrier customers based on the number of stores with this app installed. SMSI also receives additional ‘campaign’ revenue whenever carriers launch a new phone (i.e., IPhone 11) in their stores (think of ‘campaign’ revenue as a form of professional services).

This is a brief overview and I would encourage those interested in SMSI to understand their products in more detail. The short version is SMSI is application developer (industry: pre-packaged software) that sells it’s products to carriers to form marketing channels, these carrier partners then help them market and sell these products and they split the revenue. SMSI’s products are white-labeled for the carrier and acts as a revenue center for the carriers, while SMSI focuses on updating and building out the feature set of these products.

As I mentioned this is meant to be a quick update so I’ll skip to the more relevant things. SMSI had a blow out quarter In Q2 of 2019, finally turning massively profitable as I had anticipated and the share price doubled in the subsequent weeks.

After Q3 however, SMSI’s prices dropped by 40%. Nothing fundamentally changed for the company, but I believe this selloff was primarily due to the pending merger between Sprint and T-Mobile (more on this below). The TMUS & S merger has been in the works over the last 2 years so this shouldn’t be news, but given the state attorney’s trials it’s understandable that investors view this as a risk factor.

**Sprint & T-Mobile Merger**

This story impacts SMSI primarily because Sprint accounts for 77% of SMSI’s revenues, and following the “merger” (acquisition) T-Mobile will become the operating entity. If this looks worrisome, don’t be, much like my late grandmother’s pies, it looks much worse than it actually is.

Around the summer of 2018 SMSI’s management team begun guiding towards a pending Tier 1 carrier signing. At the same time, T-Mobile and Sprint announced their merger plans. SMSI’s management continued to guide toward this T1 carrier partner in the subsequent quarterly conference calls. It was widely expected that the T1 carrier would be T-Mobile. Our channel checks had also confirmed this would be the case.

However in Q3 2019 (prior to the stock price drop), SMSI’s management weakened their guidance to:

“It remains true that there is always risk with M&A activities, due to a variety of unknowns and things out of our control. However, we also see an equally great opportunity for growth and expansion of our business case as well.“

This was weakened from the previously guided T1 pending customer. The stock dropped in the following 3 months, worsened by end of year tax loss harvesting. I believe this drop is overblown. The weakening of SMSI’s guidance was immediately following the same time frame as the 2019 State attorney general lawsuit to block the TMUS & Sprint merger.

I believe while they’ve had to tone down their guidance on conference calls publicly, nothing fundamentally changed and they are still ramping up in anticipation of the T-Mobile signing. In fact, SMSI’s management has been on a significant hiring ramp the entire year, increasing their headcount from \~160 to \~200 as of Dec 2019. Actions speak louder than public guidance.

Separately, SMSI’s management have said that nothing have changed in regards to the T1 signing and their teams have been working with the merger teams at T-Mobile and Sprint directly. You can’t ask for much more ‘color’ than that.

**Operating Model**

The Q3 selloff is overblown and the subsequent tax loss harvesting have worsened the share price decline. I believe this is a once in a blue moon opportunity to buy extremely cheap shares of SMSI ahead of the upcoming TMUS and S merger trial conclusion. Numerous channel checks at TMUS and Sprint’s other vendors have point to a Feb – March timeline on new deal signings following the Jan 15 trial conclusion date.

SMSI is a 150M market cap business with 24M in cash, generating 5M and growing per quarter with no debt. We’re basically buying the business for 125M that generated 11M in cash this year and will generate 25M in 2020 and 41M in 2021. 2020 and 2021 earnings based on CFO guidance and assumes zero new carrier wins (not pricing in T-Mobile).

My updated model for SMSI reflects the guidance CFO Tim Huffmyer provided, which was recently reaffirmed:

[SMSI operating model as of Dec 2019.](https://preview.redd.it/gzv2jchct7741.png?width=2234&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cdaa907fa6dc63d9ea37ac6252c552f73fa8da4)

**Valuation**

I think SMSI is cheap on a FCF basis (2020 P/FCF of under 6), but some prefers to relative valuations, here is SMSI against its industry peers:

**Conclusion**

I believe the recent selloff is due to the softening of TMUS & Sprint merger guidance management provided on Q3, worsened by end of year tax loss harvesting. However, management actions and channel checks reaffirm T1 signing by early next year. SMSI is extremely cheap even assuming no T1 signing with TMUS. With the likely Russell 2000 inclusion, and T1 signing in early to mid 2020, SMSI shares will likely be a multi bagger in within 12 months.

t3_ehyz0q,Q2Earth ($QPWR) - confusing and/or incomplete filing data?,"Hi, I'm hoping someone can help explain some of the confusing items in filings from Q2Earth Inc.

&#x200B;

From what I see, this started with the acquisition of GBWA in 2018. Q2Earth acquired GBWA via a Stock Purchase Agreement signed in July 2018. Earlier that year in February, Earth Property Holdings LLC (""EPH"") was filed for creation, and the company went into effect on November 9, 2018. That's the same day that Q2Earth transferred the agreement to its ""unconsolidated variable interest entity"", EPH.

&#x200B;

What does EPH do? Here's the ""Purposes of the Company"" from its initial LLC filing:

The purposes of the Company are to (i) **operate the Company and utilize its assets,** (ii) exercise all other powers necessary to or reasonably connected with the Company’s business which may be legally exercised by limited liability companies under the Act and (iii) engage in all activities necessary, customary, convenient, or incident to any of the foregoing.

That's close to the most BS I've ever heard in one sentence, but then again I haven't read nearly as many SEC filings as y'all probably have. The only reference to Q2Earth in the LLC filing is this line: ""The Company is hereby authorized to engage Q2Earth Inc. as manager""

EPH was created by an ""initial member"", and two members. The initial member is Kevin Bolin, the Chairman and CEO of Q2Earth. The two members are: one institutional investor (Foxcroft Lands, LLC), and Q2Earth. Q2Earth purchased $50K of class B ""Units"", and Foxcroft Lands LLC purchased $4.4M of class A ""Units"". I haven't been able to find shit about Foxcroft Lands LLC. Searching for the exact phrase ""Foxcroft Lands, LLC"" yields just 4 results on Google, and none of them are actually relevant.

The operating address of EPH is listed as 400 Plasters Ave NE, Atlanta. The problem with that address is that it's an office building, which other businesses operate in, and there's no Suite # listed there.

Currently, Bolin is the Chairman and CEO of Q2Earth and the President of EPH and a Class B Director of EPH. The President of Q2Earth, Christopher Nelson, is now also the secretary of EPH.

&#x200B;

Who/What is Foxcroft Lands LLC? Why did ""Foxcroft Lands LLC"" invest $4.4 million? How can that name get by on an SEC filing if the LLC doesn't exist?

&#x200B;

\-----

&#x200B;

Linking this back to Q2Earth, the Company signed an eight-year management agreement with EPH ""to oversee all of the operations of EPH and its acquired subsidiaries"" for an annual fee of $700K.

Unfortunately that won't be nearly enough to keep Q2Earth afloat, as ""$2,829,488 of our convertible bridge notes, plus accrued and capitalized interest will mature beginning in March 2020 through September 2020"". As of September 30, 2019, the Company currently has a working capital deficit of $3.94 million and has lost $878K in 2019. Their latest 10Q states my feelings pretty well: ""These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.""

&#x200B;

Another curiosity I found is that the address for Q2Earth is listed as ""420 Royal Palm Way, Suite 100"". The Bloomberg profile of Q2Earth's president (Christopher Nelson)  shows that Nelson is also a current director of GreenBlock Capital LLC. The [website](https://www.greenblockcapital.com/) for GreenBlock Capital has just one page which shows the name of the company and nothing else at all. The listed address of GreenBlock Capital LLC? 420 Royal Palm Way, Suite 100.

On top of that, [this real estate website](https://miamifl.homes/idx/mls-rx-10580222-420_royal_palm_way_100_palm_beach_fl_33480) lists the property as being available and listed on the market for 39 days.

&#x200B;

It feels like something fishy is going on here. Does that seem possible or likely? Thanks for your help and time.",9,0.81,1577772876.0
t3_eiu2pl,From gambling to investing,"The post title might bring to mind quotes by Buffett where he makes a dichotomy between gambling and investing on the basis of a proper valuation.  He's right of course and the lesson is a good one, but I always chuckle to myself when I hear that contrast from him or others.  Having spent over a decade gambling professionally and successfully, I draw the line differently: Any time you make a decision about what to do with capital, you're gambling.  The question is whether you are gambling with an edge.

I'm guessing many of you are familiar with advantage play, but for those who are skeptical, here's a really mundane example: Many casinos offer video poker that, when played with correct strategy, carries only a 0.5% house edge.  If you join their player's club, you'll earn points as you play, and those points can be cashed out.  Those points might be worth 0.25%.  So on net the house still has the best of it by 0.25%, but if you only come to the casino on the days when they're offering a 6x points multiplier promotion, then you have a well-defined 1% edge on each bet you place.

So now I'm considering gradually transitioning from casinos to markets and I'm trying to get a handle on the prospects for investing or trading from home (with no intention of ever going to work in the financial industry).  I mean for someone with my background specifically, not for people in general.  The word from those who have done both is that advantage gambling is an exceptional background for markets.  It certainly looks that way to me.  Basically I suspect some of the key pieces of the puzzle for successful investing (or trading) are simply ingrained in me at this point.  I want to mention a few, for one thing to find out if you guys see carryover that could be a beneficial foundation for markets, and also in hopes that the perspective from the pro gambling world might be useful for you in your investing and trading.

1. I hear a lot about not letting emotions get the best of you as an investor or trader.  I heard the same caution when I began gambling.  Could just be survivorship bias, but I rarely encounter pros with this issue and I never had to ""struggle"" with it.  I don't think it's a matter of self-control but rather an almost automatic consequence of the advantage gambling mindset.  Simply: When we don't have an advantage, we don't bet.
2. On a related note, we spend a lot of time scouting for opportunities.  Just because we show up at a casino doesn't mean we're going to play.  There have been times when I literally scouted through casinos for a month without playing a single round because I just couldn't find a ""game,"" to use the vernacular.  That sucked but again, I don't chalk it up to exceptional self-discipline that I didn't break down and start playing keno or something.  Going hungry is no fun but it doesn't make shit suddenly sound appetizing.  I believe there is overlap here with security analysis and Buffett's ""Don't swing at every pitch.""  Again, the kind of advantage gambling I've gone after doesn't require the depth of discipline needed to be a great batter.  You simply need a template for approaching casinos that makes money in the long run and that is very different from the approach used by casual gamblers.  As one friend-turned-coworker of mine said, ""You've ruined casinos for me forever.""
3. I do some kind of valuation or risk assessment almost daily.  Some I can do in my head, others on a napkin at the (complimentary) buffet, some via spreadsheet, and once in a while I have to code it up to get the answers I'm looking for. Obviously very different from the kind of valuation you do, but it's valuation work nonetheless.
4. With that comes a ton of decision-making under uncertainty type work.  Along with various rapid judgment calls during play, I also do a lot of sizing up potential opportunities.  Like your work, these involve finding answers and synthesizing disparate sources of information.  Lots and lots of practice deciding what to do with a given opportunity: dismiss outright, place on back burner, gather more info, pursue in-depth analysis, or simply head straight there and throw as much money at it as I can.  Lots of errors along the way too, ie learning the hard way what it means to be operating outside your circle of competence.
5. I'm accustomed to committing lots of money in situations where I know the edge is strong.   Betting small when you have a monster edge is the wrong play, because monster edges are few and far between.  The actual session by session wins and losses almost generally don't even register with me any more, I only pay attention to them insofar as ex post analyses are required for further confirmation of the thesis of the play or some other reason.  The win or loss doesn't tell you anything, they're almost statistically meaningless as single data points.  What registers to me is the expected return for the session.  Repeating my broken record theme for this post, I don't ascribe my willingness to bet big to courage, nor my indifference to variance to an iron stomach.  Rather, they happen as naturally as riding a bike once you have a proper mindset. 

That's probably enough.  As I write, it sure seems to me like the habits and skills and experience would carry over nicely to investing and trading, but having never done it myself, I'd like to hear what you guys think.  How good of a foundation does it seem like to you?  What types of investing and/or trading are best suited for at-home investing as a long term side hustle, and what kind of prospects do you see for seriously pursuing it compared to passive indexing?  What types of investing/trading aren't even worth bothering with unless you're looking to work on Wall Street?",14,0.94,1577943556.0

t3_ejkt8c,The recession we’re all waiting for and the year ahead,"It’s finally 2020. Over the holidays I recalled a conversion I had  with a colleague where in early 2019 we spoke about the results of the [Q1 2019 CFO Survey](https://www.cfosurvey.org/press-release/recession-expected-by-late-2020/),  which had the headline “Recession Expected by Late 2020” and stated  that “Sixty-seven percent of U.S. CFOs believe that the U.S. will be in   recession by the third quarter of 2020, and 84 percent believe that a   recession will have begun by the first quarter of 2021.” I felt this was  meaningful as the CFO Survey results are aggregate of around 500 CFOs  based in North America, so it had some representation of what CFOs  think.

As it’s now Q1 2020, I felt it’s only fitting to go back to check up  on the results of the survey over the course of the year and see how  their predictions changed over time, here they are:

**Q1 2019 results**: 67% predict recession by Q3 2020, 84% predict Q1 2021

**Q2 2019  results** : 49% predict recession by Q2 2020, 69% predict Q4 2020

**Q3 2019  results** : 53% predict recession by Q3 2020, 67% predict Q4 2020

**Q4 2019  results** : 52% predict recession by Q4 2020, 76% predict Q2 2021

There’s a few interesting observations. First, at least half of CFOs  believe a recession is just around the corner (6-9 months out), while  the significant majority (70-80%) believe a recession will happen within  12 – 24 months. Second, it seems these timelines gets postponed a  little quarter. Most like the dangling a carrot in front of the horse.

One thing to note however, and this seems evident in the fund manager  circle as well, is that a good number of people seem to think there’s  some market risks around the mid-2020 election time frame, and to an  extent, increased market volatility. The CFO survey results is also  consistent in this regard, having a recession expectation around this  time frame in each of their last 4 survey results.

The other thing that’s been going around is that it seems most firms  predicts 2020 to enjoy some modest stock growth based on what ever  reason they choose to use this time. So to summarize, it seems census  believes:

1. Market risk around US elections
2. Increased market volatility
3. Modest market growth

For the most part I think these predictions are pretty reasonable. I  think the folks who are buying utilities to be more defensive are taking  it a tad too extreme (I also believe utilities are over priced at the  moment, but that’s a separate post). I don’t think 2020 will be too bad,  but it may be painful for some. I don’t think 2020 will be too great,  but we’ll likely see modest gains across the market.

In terms of portfolio strategy for 2020, we are likely to raise cash  while reduce holdings in stocks with the lowest expected returns (the  least favourite of our favourites), as well as stocks that require the  longest timelines to play out. We are also likely to sell into highs and  buy lows, consistent with our belief that we’ll see some volatility  (opportunity) and overall market gain for 2020.

Also, if volatility increases meaningfully, we’re likely to write options around our favourite names.

t3_eleyp5,What upside to downside ratio is compelling enough for you?,"I'm a fan of pitches that layout an upside and downside case (sometimes base case too), and increasingly we see value investors lay out these scenarios in their pitches.  After all, no matter how much homework you've done, there's always a probability for things not going your way.

I'm curious to know at what rough ratio of upside to downside people feel comfortable to go for it and invest?  So for instance, if your analysis shows that in the upside case the stock could go up 50%, but in a downside case could fall 15%, that's an up/down ratio of over 3.  Is that sufficient for you to pull the trigger, or do you need a larger ratio to feel comfortable?  Or are you comfortable with even 2-to-1 odds?

t3_el5k67,DARE Bioscience (NASDAQ: DARE) Long Equity Pitch (0.83 per share as of 1/6/20),"Overview

Dare is a micro-cap with a market cap of only about 14 M, and is thus suitable mainly for retail investors and other small funds – the volume is also around 100-200k shares each day (and thus we believe the equity is currently treated as a penny stock trading sardine). We believe that the common equity has an attractive risk reward, with three promising late stage women’s health drugs in their pipeline along with other rights which are too early stage to dive into here. Insiders seem well-aligned to form a partnership with ownership of 14% of the company, and we believe that such a deal in 2020 will be a major catalyst for the shareholders involved. We think that the company makes a great new years resolution position (1-5% position) given a decent probability for far right-tail outcomes - based on our analysis and the 4 analysts setting price targets on average modeling out at least worth $4 a share.

DARE-BV1 (Clindamycin Phosphate 2%) -

This gel targets bacterial vaginosis (BV), a bacterial vaginal infection with about 21M cases reported annually in the US. Common symptoms include discharge that often smells like fish, and can cause serious adverse health issues if left untreated. Currently approved products have significantly lower clinical cure rates (Metrogel, 1.3% 17-37%, Clindesse 30-64%, Solosec 35-68%) compared to DARE-BV1 (88% after single dose in proof of concept study n=30 patients). We have not identified any issues with the proof of concept study endpoints or design. Patents have been granted out to 2028, with more pending into 2035.

Due to the lack of efficient therapies, many patients are simply treated with poor efficacy profile antibiotics or leave the infection to go away on its own. Its worth noting that in May 2018 Lupin (350B market cap Indian Pharmaceutical Company) launched Solosec - an oral pill for BV that only requires a single dose. Lupin estimates peak sales of $100M to $150M over the next 3-4 years, and seems like an achievable / realistic estimate given that the drug is already doing 1,700 prescriptions a week ($200-$300 price range) with a strong growth pattern.

The active ingredient in the gel had been previously approved and so the 505(b)2 regulatory pathway is in use. The drug also has a QIDP Tag. The company estimates development costs to get this product to FDA approval at less than $10M. Due to the high potential efficacy, the company is targeting the drug as first line therapy. Due to the more favorable efficacy profile of DARE-BV1 as a one time use gel, a conservative assumption would be 100 M in peak sales in line with Solosec (although the share of patients receiving treatment should grow as well). Patents covering the licensed technology have terms through 2028 with pending patents expanding this through 2035.

Daré recently got clearance to commence the Phase 3 study of DARE-BV1 in \~220 women in 2020 to support the final submission. Thus, the FDA review should be finalized in 2021 without a CRL. We put the approval odds >80% given the history and well-studied efficacy profile of Clindamycin Phosphate, QIDP designation, lack of safety concerns, and strong efficacy profile with a small number of patients in the proof of concept study.

Thus, if we estimate the valuation solely on DARE-BV1 with some napkin math, and say the drug fetches around 1x sales, this puts the valuation of an approved DARE-BV1 around 100m or so after complete approval.

Thus, even with 100% dilution to get the drug fully approved (though the company has >2.4 m in cash and will likely sign a partnership deal to get cash beforehand) the market is implying a mere 30% approval chance ignoring the company's other drugs ( based on a market cap around 30 M after dilution).

This also means if approved, Dare could be a 3x return just on the basis of DARE-BV1 without dilution, and a 6x return with negligible dilution.

Ovaprene -

Ovaprene is a first-in-category contraceptive. This is a non-hormonal vaginal ring which is inserted by the woman on a monthly basis. The drug meets a few key preferences - Not used during intercourse, Woman controlled – placed by the woman and not by a physician, No fertility issue – immediate return to fertility with removal, and Hormone free.

A pivotal phase 3 should be launched in the second half 2020 with an FDA filing also expected later in 2020 or early 2021. The company recently announced the results of its Postcoital Study of Ovaprene, which were extremely positive. In our view, Ovaprene is fairly likely to be a new category of non-hormone, once a month contraceptive. Nuva Ring (owned by Merck), which is a hormone base ring used in a similar manner has sales of about $902M in 2018. Ovaprene is used very similarly, has no hormones and also seems to have a very strong efficacy profile.

Ovaprene prevented the requisite number of sperm from reaching the cervix across all women and all cycles evaluated. Specifically, in 100% of women and cycles, an average of less than five (< 5) progressively motile sperm (PMS) per high power field (HPF) were present in the midcycle cervical mucus collected two to three hours after intercourse with Ovaprene in place. The study presented strong statistical significance with N=26 women.

The licensing agreement includes up to $14.6M in product development milestone payments, up to additional $20M milestone payments related to commercialization, and 1-10% royalties. Patents covering the licensed technology have been granted with terms through 2028, with an opportunity for patent term extension and potential new patents.

This is where the valuation could get pretty crazy – we won’t go through the dilution scenario since a partnership deal is more likely in the cards before approval for 2020.

When the CEO was asked about BD interest regarding the 3 key programs on Nov 14th Q3 Call –

“I can't stress enough, and I'll put in all bolds if I could how incredibly fortunate to see the level of interest that we continue to see across the programs... We're super excited about that level of interest, and we're having that level of interest because we have 3 programs each of which is at an interesting value inflection point. Ovaprene having reported the kind of data we just reported given the field of PCT studies and how robust our PCT study is and how predictive these kinds of studies are of highly effective contraceptive methods. Clearly being the first potential monthly hormone-free contraceptive, lots of interest in Ovaprene obviously.”

What would Ovaprene be worth to a potential suitor? Considering the comparable Nuva Ring, with over $900 M in annual sales, and the lack of hormone involvement with Ovaprene, we don’t think it would be unachievable for Ovaprene to be worth at least in the ballpark of 150-900 M with just a final phase 3 study in 2H 2020 before the FDA Regulatory Review.

Therefore, if the company were to receive \~$150 M in compensation today for some sort of partnership regarding Ovaprene the stock would very likely be a 10-bagger on this catalyst. The mere market cap of 14 M seems to suggest that either Ovaprene will not be approved, or the company will not be able to sign a partnership deal even if approved.

Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% -

We won’t dive too deep into Sildenafil, especially given that the approval timeline is likely post 2023 without any delays in Ovaprene or DARE-BV1. The valuation is already extremely compelling after our research into these two key products.

Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% is a potential candidate for treating Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) which is characterized primarily by an inability to attain or maintain sufficient physical sexual arousal. The Cream is the female analog to Viagra, and actually has the same active ingredient. For this reason, the company will seek to leverage the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for the product. The phase 2b “At Home Study” is anticipated to initiate soon with topline data in late 2020. We think the approval odds are fairly high given the same active ingredient as Viagra and no currently approved treatment.

Recent studies indicate that 33% of women in the US experience symptoms of low / no sexual arousal, with give or take 16% of this population (\~10M women) actively seeking treatment.

FSAD has no approved treatment and it is reasonable to assume 10% of those actively seeking treatment use the product, and we will add some margin of safety / padding for the valuation given that the studies may be off in saying only 2.5M women are seeking treatment. Viagra used to be around \~$60/pill back in 2017, and a conservative annual cost of give or take $400 per patient puts us around 250,000 women with annual sales of $100M. In our view, this seems a little obscene juxtaposed with the market cap of 14 M and negligible debt, especially with the other two opportunities outlined above.

In summary, Dare's goal is to advance these programs until enough value was created to sign a partnership deal. The nano-cap will not take any product to market by itself, as this will force too way too much dilution onto existing shareholders. Since inception no partnership deals were signed since most programs were too early stage and recently acquired by the company. We believe that such a deal will be a major catalyst for the share price, and is likely next year given management’s sentiment and the recent news regarding Ovaprene and DARE-BV1. Announcements regarding positive outcomes from studies have surprisingly not moved the company’s stock price, but partnerships should force some value realization here.

I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

t3_emy35d,Why are people so bearish on MAC?,"I can't claim to be an expert on the stock market, especially not REITS (real estate investment trusts) but I find the way the market is punishing MAC really irrational. 

1. I see the argument for the retail apocalypse and the rise in e-commerce, and how that would take out department stores leading to bankruptcies that would ultimately affect the landlords (malls), but wouldn‘t AAA malls be able to avoid that? These premium buildings are about the experience (entertainment, restaurants, etc). Also, who buys luxury goods over the internet? (I know I don‘t buy jewelry over the internet but perhaps the general population is vastly different). So, in my opinion, although the premium malls that MAC manages may be affected by the retail apocalypse, I see the effects as small scale.

2. Another problem has come to my attention, namely low FFO (a sort of a measure of earnings for REITS). However, MAC have been concentrating their portfolio; disposing of subprime malls in favor of their best performers (leading to investment expenses). A project in Philadelphia is expected to start generating income in 2020 which may improve the FFO. Also the sales numbers from the stores and the occupancy rates are solid.

t3_emvp68,"Being long the VIX with a low entry point seems like one of the easiest ways to make money, what am I missing here","This seems very simple so I assume I am missing something, here is the premise: 

The VIX has started trading in 1993, the lowest point its ever had was 9.14 and the highest was 79. Most of the time it trades in a range of 11-13. However it's had numerous spikes throughout time that brought its price up 30/40% very quickly. 

So it seems to me a reasonable hedge to a long position is to buy the VIX when it trades to about 12, and simply wait for an inevitable spike and then sell into it as gets over 16/17+. Your downside in this 27 year history is at 10ish, and upside is much higher. 



The only negative is that its dead money for long periods of time (this is where your long positions should do well), however when those spikes come you get exponential increase in value very quickly.

t3_eomqf9,Berjaya Food Berhad (5196.KL),"Berjaya Food Berhad (BJFOOD) is, as the name suggests, an F&B restaurant company. What you may not know is that it is the master franchisor (i.e. regional operator) of the Starbucks brand of companies in Malaysia. That’s right, BJFOOD owns Starbucks in Malaysia! Hence, if you want some exposure to this amazing global brand for a reasonably affordable outlay, you can consider investing in this stock. 

**Pricing Power**

What’s to like about this stock? Basically, it’s the fact that it is Starbucks. I previously talked about the importance of pricing power in my last article. Starbucks too clearly has pricing power in its products. A casual observer would notice that the company hikes the prices of its products by about 5% about once every 3 years to keep up with inflation. That is, in my opinion, an extraordinary feat – a recurring, perpetual ability to increase prices without affecting demand. This has been apparent in its rising revenue over time, from RM 376M in 2015 to RM 788M in 2019.

**Sales**

Of course, the increase in revenue hasn’t come from simply hiking prices. BJFOOD has another miraculous capacity – the ability to guarantee demand and print cash from its stores simply by virtue of existing. That’s the power of the Starbucks brand. Practically none of its stores are non-performing, with only 4 or 5 stores having been closed down due to performance issues since its debut on the stock market. BJFOOD has been increasing its store count by roughly 10% per year like clockwork ever since it began, reaching nearly 300 stores for the financial year ending 2019. In other words, you can approximately bet that it will increase revenue by at least 10% a year. That is, in my opinion, another astounding feat.

None of this would be considerable, of course, without considering the same-store sales growth (SSSG) metric. SSSG is basically the growth in sales which the company experiences from its existing stores y-o-y, without accounting for growth in sales from new stores. This basically measures performance of the stores on an apples-to-apples basis from one year to the next. SSSG from Starbucks stores has been approximately 5-6% per year for each of the last five years, which if you’re not familiar with the retail industry, is a really good milestone to achieve. 

**Cash Flow**

So far, there’s much to like about the company – but we’ve only talked about one thing, Sales! There’s another thing to like about this company, and that is Cash Flow! Put simply, the cash flow profile of this company is excellent. Putting aside the fact that the company prints money like clockwork every year – as evident from its steady, recurrent Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow – the working capital position is out of this world. Firstly, it has very low inventory and receivable days simply because it deals with perishable goods and because its customers tend to transact in cash terms. However, what one might miss is the fact that it also has high Payable days because Starbucks has strong bargaining power over its suppliers. 

Aside from that, it has a special line item on its balance sheet known as Deferred Income. This is basically mostly the prepaid value stored on its Starbucks cards, which totalled nearly RM 70M as at FY2019 (compared to annual profits of RM 24M). In other words, Starbucks utilizes the cash value stored on its Starbucks cards to pay suppliers before it even makes a sale! Think about it, normally, a company needs to come up with cash upfront from investors to pay suppliers for inventory before it can start selling products and earning revenue. In Starbucks’ case, it uses the prepaid value of its cards to pay suppliers in order to buy inventory, then sells the products without a single cent being contributed by investors! This is called negative working capital, a cash profile in a company as rare and desirable as a true real-life unicorn. As a result, putting together receivable days, inventory days, payable days and deferred income, you get an obscenely low Cash Conversion Ratio. In other words, this is a company which will never go bankrupt due to cash issues. 

**Growth**

With all the above considered, you can expect steady annual revenue growth of 15% (10% from new stores + 5% from existing stores) into perpetuity, do a margin analysis to arrive at earnings growth, and attach a multiple to arrive at a reasonable valuation. It is the simplest type of business to value, almost utility-like in characteristic. Cash flow is a non-issue since the Starbucks brand simply prints money like clockwork. This is the mother of business models to fall in love with. No wonder the Starbucks stock in the US has performed so well over the years!

**Risks & Opportunities**

So what are the risks? Well, for one the company has shored up a lot of debt in order to wholly acquire the Starbucks franchise in 2014. As of FY2019, it had long-term debt of RM 127M and short-term debt of RM 161M – and the figure keeps rolling over ever higher and higher year-over-year. This is in comparison to Operating Cash Flow of RM 131M and Free Cash Flow of about RM 50M in FY19. Not the worst of positions to be in, all things considered, but it could be better. Ideally, I’d love if the company would focus on paring down its debt instead of paying dividends (which amounted to RM 15M for FY19).

Another risk, which I haven’t talked about yet, is the fact that the company also has other food franchises under its hood. That’s right, BJFOOD does not only own the Starbucks franchise, it also owns two other restaurant franchises. These are the Kenny Rogers brand and the Jollibean brand. Unfortunately for BJFOOD, both of these franchises are non-performing, with the former roughly breaking even over the years while the latter is loss-making. However, they are roughly self-sufficient when considering the scale of the company, and not too much of a headache if history is anything to go by. 

From a capital perspective, it pays to mention that the company hasn’t issued significant amounts of equity over its lifetime. It has a lot of debt, but it pays a roughly 1% dividend yield and it is quite active in stock buybacks (owning 4% of outstanding shares in treasury stock as of FY19). This is ideal as the business is utility-like in its cash flow structure (i.e. Starbucks basically prints money), and it earns enough cash flow to both pay back coupons and return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. 

Another risk that one may naturally consider is the fluctuating price of raw materials, specifically coffee beans. However, it should be noted that coffee beans only make up 10% of costs of raw materials because Starbucks’ main money maker is its frappuccinos and flavoured drinks, not its coffees. Hence, a rise in prices of coffee beans does not hugely impact its bottom line. You may even be surprised to find out that its biggest cost component (from a gross margin perspective) is actually milk!

What are the opportunities for Starbucks, or BJFOOD in particular? Well, not much to be honest. If you like this stock, it’s because you’re comfortable with approximately 15% revenue growth year-over-year. This isn’t going to be a multi-bagger for the same reasons it isn’t going to go bankrupt – because it’s a stable, boring business. And that’s okay, in fact, that’s more than okay. But just know what you’re getting into.

**Valuation**

Okay, we’ve gone over the business and its financials, let’s come to the last topic, Valuation. At 22x PE with mediocre earnings growth of about 10%, its not a particular attractive valuation. But keep in mind that you’re also paying a premium for the steady brand that is Starbucks and all its salient attributes. At this price of RM 1.33, I don’t think it’s a particularly attractive stock. But you definitely should keep it on your watchlist in case the stock craters to approximately RM 1.

**Summary**

To conclude, this is a reasonably attractive stock that you should keep on your watchlist because of its excellent business and cash flow characteristics. If the share price ever falls to RM 1, scoop it up by the truckload.

Lollapalooza building up in certain retail stocks. The negative sentiment towards certain retail stocks has sufficiently compounded to be an opportune asymmetrical upside for certain retail common stocks.

The addition of accounting rules whereby lease liabilities are added to the balance sheet does not alter the projected free cash flows, yet has influenced the valuation of companies in the retail industry. As much as I understand why an investor would perceive this as increased risk or decreased valuation due to a sharp rise in Enterprise Value, I also believe this is an ignorant approach to investing because this information was always available to investors who did no more than open an annual report, or simply understood real estate leases have always been financial obligations, regardless of their treatment on the balance sheet.

Zero likelihood of bankruptcy over next 12-24 months given momentum of cashflows in relation to available liquidity including outstanding lines of credit. 

Market cap pricing which is approximately 1x historical free cashflow average.

Price to Sales ratio are currently multiple standards of deviation below all time historical lows.

Significant potential momentum once maximum pessimism subsides, since these are widely held stocks, unlike two other 'cheap' stocks like SUMR and SCOO, which also fit the criteria, yet have extremely limited trading volume in relation.

To see two examples of companies in the middle of retail turnarounds with an uncertain futures, which were/are priced similarly at liquidation: ±1x average FCF, but underwent 5x runs within months, look at SSI, and CBKC.

I believe that these are two examples of cigar butts, as their future is perhaps uncertain, but the price is so low, that if you owned 100% of the shares right now, you could extract the more value in physical cash dollar bills that are owned by the company. The challenge with a minority position is that you are betting that other investors will price in this potentiality, or betting that the company will actually turnaround and pay you back much more but much later. The reality is  that management or the board will not distribute cash back to investors as this time, and their 3-5 year futures are uncertain, and so this method of valuation does not appear to have teeth, but it is apparent that the investment community traditionally does price in this as a potential event nonetheless.

Based on experience, these stocks could STILL go down around 50% from here, but have the upside potential of 2x - 10x within a 12-24 month period.

# Investment Thesis

*Attis Industries* is currently undergoing a transition from a waste management company to a multi-oriented conglomerate. They are delinquent on multiple SEC filings and this has turned into a major catalyst for the company's share price. While delinquent financials usually spell trouble for a company, Attis Industries has become a special situation whereupon the completion and submission of their financial reports, the market will hopefully realize the true value of the company’s assets. From what I’ve gathered, Attis’ current book value of $13,700,000 does not represent the fair value of the company's assets. Upon completion and submission of their financial reports, true book value will be closer to $50,000,000 due to financing and recent acquisitions not stated in Attis' most recent filing. Not only are Attis' asset values extremely understated, but revenues are grossly understated aswell. The company's latest filing states a revenue figure of only $1,070,000. Attis' full-year 2020 revenue projections are stated at roughly $160,000,000. While the timeline for the posting of Attis' financials is still unclear, they have taken many positive steps in the right direction over the last year and made this statement upon delisting on 11/19/19:

>“Attis is continuing to work tirelessly with its independent accounting firm to bring all of its delinquent filings current. Once all of the filings have been completed and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and all other listing requirements have been met, the Company plans to immediately begin the reapplication process with the Exchange to elevate Attis’ publicly available securities back to the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.”

In Attis’ case, I would say actions speak louder than words and the crux of this thesis is dependent on them following through on this promise. The notable actions they have taken over the last year include the recent hiring of an SEC Financial Reporting Director, the transition to BDO as their independent auditor, and the implementation of strict accounting procedures across all business segments. While these changes don't point to an exact filing date, they have significantly increased the odds of Attis coming through on their promise to update their filings and will bring forth much-needed clarity and transparency from the company to the public markets when financials are finally posted.

# Financial Projections

As stated before, Attis' operations can be split into three operating segments; Attis Innovations, Attis Healthcare, and Flux Carbon LLC.

*Attis Innovations* is expected to have generated $150,000,000 in ""guaranteed"" revenues by the end of full-year 2020. These revenues are guaranteed through a 10-year off-take agreement with Sunoco at Attis' Fulton Ethanol Plant.  Attis purchased the Fulton Ethanol facility from Sunoco in June of 2019 at a price of $20,000,000 and the facility was recently appraised at a value of $57,000,000. If you compare Attis' Fulton operations to a competitor like Valero, you'll find that Fulton's operating profit could be in the range of $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 by the end full-year 2020. Attis has plans to take Fulton from an 85,000,000 gallon ethanol facility to a 100,000,000 gallon facility adding an additional $20,000,000 to revenues upon completion of the upgrades.

*Attis Healthcare* has stated that upon full rollout of their operations, they expect revenues to be close to $100,000,000. Robert Dunn, president of Attis Healthcare, has projected full-year 2019 healthcare revenues to have been between $10,000,000 and $12,000,000. He made this statement in late 2018 (press release dated 10/22/18):

>""Deep market analysis has led Attis Healthcare to design and build its current lab infrastructure to handle samples that would produce revenue of $10-$12 million and margins between 20-25%. With further lab and infrastructure build-out and a concentrated effort by our contracted sales force, I believe we can double our expected revenue in the next 12 to 18 months.”

With revenues of approximately $10,000,000 and a gross margin of between 20 to 25%, operating profits for the segment should be somewhere around $1,000,000. The total acquisition costs attached to Attis' healthcare segment since inception is roughly $7,000,000.

*Flux Carbon LLC* is said to be producing roughly $14,000,000 in annualized revenues as of 06/21/18, with gross margins close to 70% and an operating profit at least $4,000,000. The total cost of Attis' 80% ownership of Flux Carbon LLC is estimated to be around $30,000,000. As a side note, Attis, along with its JVCo partner Greenshift Corporation, launched an appeal in September of 2018 to overturn a summary judgment in a patent infringement case, where, if won, Flux Carbon LLC) could see over 90% of the corn ethanol industry paying royalties to them for patents they own. While chances of a favorable ruling appear slim, if won, this would be a huge added bonus to what Attis has already accomplished. If lost, I see the end result being a short-term, temporary set back that may provide an even better buy-in opportunity for future shareholders and signal the end of a company quiet period.

Financing for the company’s ambitions does not appear to be an issue as Attis has, within the last year, received non-dilutive financing for the purchase of their Fulton ethanol facility, received financing for their planned upgrades to their Fulton facility, and received financing for both their commercial and federal labs. Attis is also in the process of restructuring debt in an attempt to eliminate future dilution.

In conclusion, by the end of full-year 2020, Attis is projecting to have produced $150,000,000 in guaranteed revenues, $24,000,000 in non-guaranteed revenues, and an estimated $8,000,000 in operating profit across all segments. Today, Attis Industries currently trades on the OTC markets at a market capitalization of less than $2,500,000. Upon completion and filing of their financials, I can easily see Attis' market capitalization being no less than a conservative $20,000,000, a possible 10x return.

# The Formation of Attis

On 02/20/18, Meridian Waste Solutions sold their waste management service operations to Warren Equity Partners for $90,000,000 and the remaining operations were rebranded as Attis Industries. The transaction eliminated $87,000,000 of debt and allowed the newly formed entity, Attis Industries, to pursue new business opportunities in higher-margin industries. The remaining assets, not sold in the deal, were expected to generate $3,000,000 in pre-tax earnings and cut the company’s debt burden by 90%, according to Jeff Cosman, Attis Industries CEO.

Since the formation of Attis in 2018, the company has made multiple acquisitions, formed multiple partnerships, and launched an appeal to overturn a summary judgment in a patent infringement case tied to their subsidiary, Flux Carbon LLC. First, we will tackle the acquisitions and partnerships they have made since inception. For the sake of structure, I have organized the partnerships and acquisitions under four banners; Attis Innovations, Attis Healthcare, Flux Carbon LLC, and Other. The “other” category pertains to acquisitions and partnerships that have not been finalized but are still “in the works.”

**Flux Carbon LLC Acquisitions**

Advanced Lignin Biocomposites LLC & UT Battelle LLC Partnership

* Acquisition Date: 11/30/17
* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/11/meridian-waste-solutions-completes-acquisition-for](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/11/meridian-waste-solutions-completes-acquisition-for)
* Advanced Lignin owns and develops lignin recovery, production and application technology. Advanced Lignin uses its methods to more cost-effectively produce many different materials, including adhesives, renewable fuels, carbon fiber, and plastics. Advanced Lignin’s main operations generated revenues of approximately $7,000,000 to $10,000,000 and $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 of cash flows the year prior. Along with this acquisition came Advanced Lignin’s partnership with UT-Battelle LLC, the management and operating contractor for the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. On 05/29/18 Attis restructured this acquisition to reduce the associated expense and liabilities of the deal by about $1,350,000.

Genarex FD LCC 49% Interest

* Acquisition Date: 05/29/18
* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/attis-industries-acquires-49-stake-in-genarex](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/attis-industries-acquires-49-stake-in-genarex)
* Attis purchased a 49% stake in Genarex FD LLC. Genarex is a technology development company focused on refining low-cost renewable feedstocks into functional biofillers. Genarex is capable of recovering about 1.1 pounds of biobased plastics additive per gallon of ethanol produced, which equates to an expected $11 million in new EBITDA from each 100 million gallon per year ethanol facility. Under applicable agreements, the Company agreed, in pertinent part, to pay an aggregate purchase price of $2,266,667, plus 8% of the EBITDA and certain material transaction proceeds of the Company’s Innovations group.

FLUX Carbon LLC 80% Interest(JVCo)

* Acquisition Date: 05/31/19
* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/attis-industries-acquires-clean-technology-licensing](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/attis-industries-acquires-clean-technology-licensing)
* JVCo is a new joint venture company between Attis Industries and Greenshift Corporation that holds the rights to an expansive portfolio of clean technologies and manages an existing engineering and licensing business. This new joint venture can be expected to initially contribute between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 to Attis’ earnings. The existing business generated approximately $7,000,000 per year in sales with gross margins of about 70% for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017. The Company agreed to pay an earn-out based purchase price with a floor of $18 million. An initial payment was paid at closing in the form of restricted shares of the Company’s stock, including 180,000 shares of the Company’s Series G preferred stock. GreenShift is required to use the first proceeds received upon sale of the shares to pay or refinance its senior secured debt.
* The opportunity with Greenshift and JVCo could be huge for Attis. Greenshift is currently in legal battles over patent infringement, claiming that multiple ethanol producers have infringed on their patents. According to Attis, “CleanTech and its inventors developed and commercialized a process that intercepts the flow of that final third in the plant, extracts corn oil, and returns the stream back to the host for completion of drying. The extracted oil is then most commonly sold as a feedstock for refining into biodiesel for about $0.25 per pound. CleanTech has licensed its portfolio of corn oil extraction patents to producers of about 12% of the 15 billion gallons of ethanol produced annually in the U.S. However, CleanTech estimates that upwards of 90% of the corn ethanol industry practices methods covered by CleanTech’s patents, and some of those patents are the subject of litigation which CleanTech has asserted against about 10% of the industry alleging infringing use since 2010.”
* On 09/05/18, Attis and Greenshift filed an appeal to overturn a summary judgment deeming GreenShift’s patents unenforceable. Oral arguments recently took place on December 3rd and the final verdict is still under deliberation. Audio of the oral arguments can be found here: [https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=152592091](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=152592091).

* The laboratory has already received COLA accreditation for laboratory quality assurance, expects CLIA certification in the coming weeks, and is now in the application process for Medicare coverage for all states and Medicaid coverage in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Colorado and New Mexico.

CLIA License

* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/44/attis-industries-obtains-clia-certification-for-its-first](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/44/attis-industries-obtains-clia-certification-for-its-first)
* Attis obtained its CLIA Certification for its first internally developed lab. The Company expects that this federal laboratory will be testing a baseline of 3,000 toxicology samples per month by the end of 2018, which trends to approximately $600,000 per month of revenue and over $7,000,0000 for 2018. The Company also expects to add blood testing to its federal laboratory by the end of the year, which will drive additional revenue growth for the Company moving forward. By the second quarter of 2019, they expect the combined number of blood and toxicology samples in the federal lab to be between 5,000 and 8,000 per month. This means the federal lab is expected to be generating over $1,000,000 in revenue per month by mid-2019.

CMS License

* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/58/attis-industries-secures-medicare-license-for-tulsa](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/58/attis-industries-secures-medicare-license-for-tulsa)
* Attis announced that it has received the Medicare license for its toxicology laboratory in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The laboratory, which received its CLIA license in August, is dedicated to running samples reimbursed by Medicare and individual state Medicaid programs only (“federal lab”). Now that Attis has received its CMS license, which provides Medicare coverage for all states, Attis will begin taking samples and billing under its new Medicare number while at the same time begin applying for Medicaid coverage for the states of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Colorado and New Mexico. Deep market analysis has led Attis Healthcare to design and build its current lab infrastructure to handle samples that would produce revenue of $10-$12 million and margins between 20-25%. “With further lab and infrastructure build-out and a concentrated effort by our contracted sales force, I believe we can double our expected revenue in the next 12 to 18 months.”

t3_eubk2k,A quick take of AutoWeb (AUTO),"This is a brief overview of AUTO. I was introduced to AUTO late last year and recently got around to taking a look at this business recently. I was attracted to it primarily because this is a lead gen business which has many of the same qualities as SaaS businesses on their rev gen side (marketing metrics/conversion rates).

AUTO acquire website traffic via their portfolio of sites, convert this traffic into leads, and sells it to local dealerships. A capital light business that have some similarities to SaaS and tech businesses we’re normally invested in.

Ultimately I decided against taking any positions, but I thought I’d share my quick analysis of AUTO with those who are interested.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

AUTO is a lead gen business that owns a portfolio of automobile related websites, namely: [autobytel.com](https://autobytel.com), [car.com](https://car.com), [usedcars.com](https://usedcars.com), and [usedtrucks.com](https://usedtrucks.com).

This is a an asset and capex light business in that they generate traffic from different sources (which I’ll cover briefly below), convert these traffic into leads of customers who are interested in used cars, and then sell these leads to local dealerships who has the inventory of the cars customers want.

&#x200B;

In a general sense, AUTO’s business makes sense and provides value for both their partners (car buyers and car sellers).

 

I’ll spare everyone the history of the business, but the short version is the old management team was shown the door due to poor management and declining revenues. New CEO was brought in and brought in his own executive team in 2019.

&#x200B;

When the old guards leave and new ones come into a declining business, investors want to see the following:

1	Transparency, and honesty on how the business is actually performing (PAR’s new CEO is a great example of how a new CEO should act)

2	A plan to get the business back on track

3	Signs that the business is stabilizing

 

Unfortunately I would rate management’s #1 & #2 as a 5/10 at best, and as for #3, there’s been no signs the business decline is stabilizing.

 

\#1 & #2: After joining, the new management’s plan is essentially optimizing on revenue per lead as opposed to driving new leads. This is very disappointing as it shows management has no plan to solve the root cause of their problem to begin with, which was the decline in traffic (i.e., revenue).

 

I’m equally disappointed in the constant frugality talk instead of solving their root problem. “What you’ll find is that we are doing more with what we have” (19Q3 CC)

 

Most of the company’s trouble have to do with a decline in traffic and unfortunate timing in the slowdown of the US auto market. AUTO lost many of their paying car dealerships in the last 2 years in the market wide slowdown. However this is conflicting, as when car sales drop, you would think car dealerships would be more inclined to buy qualifying leads.

 

This leads me to believe car dealerships do not find AUTO’s leads meaningful in providing a ROI, and dealerships are cutting cost around ineffective marketing (AUTO’s leads) and increasing spend elsewhere (Google Ads).

&#x200B;

Indeed, management have also signaled in conference calls that they have been revamping their internal tracking systems to better show ROI for dealerships.

&#x200B;

I believe until this problem is solved and dealerships are persuaded that they should be spending their marketing dollars with AUTO, AUTO will continue to experience difficulties keeping old clients and signing new ones.

 

\#3: As mentioned earlier, I was initially attracted to AUTO’s business model frankly because the same rev gen models that are used to calculate conversion rates from SaaS or growth tech companies can also be used with AUTO.

&#x200B;

At it’s root, AUTO can sell more leads if it can generate more leads, and if it can generate more leads if it gets more traffic. However the decline of their traffic have resulted in a decline in revenue, and new management is currently optimizing this remaining traffic instead of growing their traffic base.

 

While optimizing their conversion rates is a understandable thing to do, you’ll never grow if you’re forced to make more with the same amount. You don’t get rich by trying to make the most of a minimum wage job, you get rich by making more money (while also optimizing your monthly spend).

 

It’s admirable that the new management is looking to stabilize the business by increasing conversion rates and optimizing lead revenue, but this doesn’t fundamentally change their situation until they can find a way to renew their lost traffic. The current optimization plans will at best get them to a rough breakeven point. Their current market cap is 30M, with a 1.1M balance sheet while losing 2M per quarter. While they can likely bring in some AR, this will likely only buy them a longer runway until they can solve the real problem.

 

Importantly, we noticed AUTO’s primary website [Autobytel.com](https://Autobytel.com)’s traffic halved in late August 2019, dropping from an average of 1.2M visitors per month, to 600k per month:

&#x200B;

With Q4 2019 earnings coming up, AUTO will likely be reporting more bad news before any good ones come in.

 

For now, I’ll be waiting on the sidelines until they can prove they have a plan to increase traffic and revenue, show stabilization in quarterly losses, and importantly show some honesty in their performance metrics.

&#x200B;

Feedback is welcome if I missed anything, I may take another look at it in the future.

&nbsp; 

*In 1987, Buffett famously stated, ""I'll tell you why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It's addictive. And there's fantastic brand loyalty.""*

*“The best business to own is one that over an extended period of time can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return.” – Warren Buffett*

*“Invest at the point of maximum pessimism.” – John Templeton*

&nbsp;

Warren Buffett’s best winners have always been stocks which were bought during times of maximum pessimism. GEICO was bought on the brink of bankruptcy. AMEX was bought during the Salad Oil Scandal. Goldman Sachs was also bought with bankruptcy looming. Wells Fargo was a bank with a largely residential loan book bought during a housing crisis. Coca-Cola was bought at a time of massive overdiversification. And so on and so forth.   

It’s not often that one has the opportunity to put into practice the all-encompassing philosophy of buy low, sell high. But even when that opportunity rears its ugly head, it’s the rare investor who has the aptitude and the stomach to back up the truck. Thankfully, these opportunities do exist, but it takes a keen eye to discern the difference between a falling knife and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

&nbsp;

**Overview**

British American Tobacco (BAT) Malaysia is one such example. Currently trading at just ***8x PE, sporting a 100% ROE, and giving a 15% dividend yield***, it’s hard not to salivate a little at the financial statistics. But why is such a high ROI stock – a cigarette company no less – trading at such awfully low valuations? 

First, some history. BAT Malaysia is the largest cigarette company in the country, with a roughly 50% legal market share and 12% total industry market share. If you’re observant, you’ll notice that Malaysia’s illegal cigarette market share takes up a whopping 65% share of the pie. This was largely due to the massive excise duty (i.e. sin tax) hike in 2015, which brought illegal market share from a reasonable 33% before the hike to 65% and rising today. 

As a result, BAT Malaysia has suffered massive share price declines, with the share price falling by 85% in the past 5 years (from RM 60 in 2015) and 70% in the past 12 months alone (from RM 37 in early-2019). This was largely due to revenue declines of nearly 20% and earnings decline of 40% over the past 3 years, with a corresponding shortfall in dividends (the company has a 90% dividend policy). ROE has also fallen from approximately 200% to around 100% today. 

Thus, it’s not surprising that the stock has taken such a beating. Indeed, over the past two weeks alone the stock price has fallen by about 30%. But is investing in it now simply trying to catch a falling knife?

&nbsp;

**Business Narrative**

The source of the problem can largely be traced back to the sin tax hike in 2015, which brought illegal cigarette market share from 33% to 65% over the past 5 years. The Malaysian government has not been very accommodative to local industry players, rebuffing efforts to reduce the sin tax and dragging its feet when it comes to the enforcement of existing laws and the introduction of new ones. The local Customs department, working together with the police, has had some success in recent years tackling the illegal cigarette cartel – arresting the decline in legal market share from 20%-30% annually to just above 10% in the past year – but efforts are largely seen as too little, too late. On top of that, the illegal vaping scene has blossomed in Malaysia, with nicotine-related products claiming up to 10% of total industry market share. 

This backdrop has inspired analysts to impose doomsday scenarios for the legal industry players (i.e. BAT, PMI & JTI), according present values to the companies which reflect a resumption of historical revenue and market share declines. Indeed, when parsing the financial statements of BAT, it’s not impossible to forecast revenues declining to a point where they fall below operating costs (i.e. EBITDA of zero), rendering the equity essentially worthless valuation-wise. 

The main reason for the government’s lack of progress is bureaucracy. Different governmental ministries have drawn different interpretations of their legal jurisdiction regarding the matter, and thus shuffle the responsibility of arresting the illegal trade to their peers. For instance, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has stated that it has no authority to enforce legislation against illegal cigarettes, while the Customs department disagrees and says it is the MOH’s prerogative to clamp down on illegal cigarette packets which don’t portray mandatory and unsightly health warnings (illegal cigarette packets tend not to include them). As a result of the red tape, there has been little progress on the front lines, and legal industry players are lesser of for it. 

BAT and JTI (the two largest cigarette players) have resorted to shutting down their manufacturing operations and implementing an importation business model, where legal cigarettes are imported from Indonesia into the country to be sold. BAT has also gone through one round of layoffs last year, with a second round expected in 2020. 

&nbsp;

**Financials**

As alluded to earlier, revenues have declined by 20% over the past 3 years while net profit has declined by 40%. This was surprisingly not due to a contraction of Gross Margin (which you’d expect as costs go up when switching from a manufacturing model to an importation model), but largely as a result of revenues falling while operating costs remain the same. This can be seen in the Operating Margin falling from a high of 24% in 17Q3 to 18% in 19Q3, and net margin contracting from 18% in 17Q3 to 13% in 19Q3. 

On the balance sheet side, things look much rosier. Intangibles take up the lion’s share of assets (40%), while Inventories and Receivables have declined slightly in line with the fall in Revenue. Net cash is negative owing to a revolving credit facility which the company has drawn presumably for tax reasons. The debt is current in nature and can be paid back in full with 2 years of Free Cash Flow. The company doesn’t have much fixed assets remaining following the closure of its manufacturing plant, indicating that liquidation value (approximately zero) falls far short of market value. Current ratio is reasonable at 0.8x. Share capital has not changed for at least 3 years. 

Receivable days and Inventory days have respectively increased by roughly 50% over the last 3 years – indicating a struggling business which is facing business challenges from its illegal brethren. Payable days have remained static over the same time period. As a result, Cash Conversion Cycle stands at 79 days, up by double from 33 days in 2018. 

Cash flow is still stable, with cash receipts approximating revenues. Free Cash Flow is almost equal to Operating Cash Flow, exemplifying the asset-light nature of the current business. The company pays out the entirety of its FCF as dividends (and then some), leading to a dividend yield of 15% at the current share price and a 118% dividend payout ratio. 

&nbsp;

**Risks**

The risks are apparent. If the government doesn’t do something about the illegal trade and allows it to run rampant, it’s possible that illegal market share increases from here and revenues continue to decline. In the worst-case scenario, it’s not hard to envision revenues falling below operating costs and EBITDA reaching zero, implying the shares are worthless and that dividends will be cut or even stopped entirely.

The current share price of 8x PE (RM 10.00) reflects this doomsday view. The market is basically pricing in declining earnings growth into perpetuity and giving no stock to a potential turnaround. Government intervention to address the illegal trade is widely perceived as sorely lacking and possibly not existing, with analysts imputing revenue declines of up to 30% a year into their models. Share price targets range from RM 11 – RM 15, although the share price has fallen by some 20% since the last revision of analyst reports. All in all, it seems like bad news for BAT.

&nbsp;

**Opportunities**

The opportunities for BAT, while less apparent, do exist. For one, the government could by some miracle successfully enforce existing laws and put the brakes on illegal trade – it has already slowed the latter’s advance by some 50% since the sin tax hike. 
Alternatively, the government could recognize the disadvantages of the narrowing tax base from legal cigarettes and decide to reverse or reduce the sin tax, leading to a reclaiming of legal market share by industry players to previous highs. By some back-of-the-envelope calculations, if legal market share rises to just half of their historical levels, BAT’s earnings and share price could double from here. PE ratios would also expand in such a scenario. 

BAT’s parent company in London could also decide to acquire the Malaysian subsidiary given the depressed prices. A fair market price given the circumstances would be roughly 15x PE, which assuming earnings continue to decline by 30% from today, would put the acquisition price at around 120-130% from current share prices. 

BAT has also been experimenting with nicotine-related products, such as the Heat-Not-Burn (HNB) device known as Glo (PMI has a branded competitor known as IQOS). Both have received glowing reviews from former cigarette users and is expected to help the companies transition into the post-smoking era (i.e. 20-30 years from now). So far, Glo has developed a 1% total industry market share in Malaysia despite only being launched 2 years ago, showcasing its popularity and potential success. 

Finally, the government is preparing the release of new legislation regarding vaping, which is due to see light by mid-2020. While legalization is still not guaranteed, government officials have publicly admitted the difficulty of enforcing laws if a vaping ban were to be instituted. If vaping is legalized, the legal industry could see a 10% increase in market share overnight as they introduce their own products to supplement the demand for currently illegal products. 

&nbsp;

**Risk : Reward**

In my opinion, current share prices have priced in all the risks while discounting all the opportunities. Even assuming earnings decline at an average annual rate of 10% into perpetuity, it would take just ten years to reclaim your initial investment. This is assuming illegal market share continues its rise unabated and legal market share never sees the light of day again. Keep in mind that the company has a 90% dividend payout policy, and has kept this rate despite recent struggles in its business, so you’d get a return of capital regardless of the share price performance.

In this worst-case scenario, the parent company would either push for an acquisition or liquidate the Malaysian operations. An acquisition at fire-sale prices would probably yield at least 5x PE, while a liquidation would yield nothing given the current ratio of 0.8x. The latter is highly unlikely because it would mean that BAT ceases to have a presence in Malaysia completely, a growing South East Asian nation with GDP growth of 4-5% and potentially bright future. Hence, given the probabilities and an estimate of expected value, you’d already come out on top at the current PE of 8x. 

What about the alternative? Before we get into the valuation from an opportunity set perspective, let us consider BAT’s business model. As Buffett says, this is a company with unit economics of a penny per cigarette, selling them at a dollar per cigarette, fantastic brand loyalty and a captive audience. Imagine if you could have owned Altria in the USA in the 1970’s. Today, you’d own Altria, Kraft Heinz, PMI and a smattering of profitable businesses around the world. While I don’t mean to draw a direct comparison between BAT Malaysia today and Altria USA of the 70’s, it’s not hard to imagine a similarly wonderful future for a company with such an attractive business model. 

As far as economic moats are concerned, the cigarette business is probably one of the few businesses you can say will be around in another 20-30 years. Sure, they’re facing headwinds in the form of a burgeoning illegal cigarette trade today, but who says they will still be facing the same demons 10 years from now, or even 5 years? If there’s one thing for certain, it’s that the business environment is fluid – and chances are good that things won’t remain the same as today, whatever they may be. 

&nbsp;

**A Reasonable Bull-Case Scenario Valuation**

Let’s put the humdrums aside for a moment and imagine a brighter future for BAT. What would this future look like? For one, it’s possible that within the next 5 years the government realizes it can’t contain the illegal cigarette problem and decide to reduce the sin tax to previous levels. The wider tax base resulting from such a move would result in the same absolute amount in taxes even at lower tax rates – so there is no financial disincentive not to do so – while at the same time reducing the illegal market share. If legal market share even reclaims half of their former levels, the share price of BAT could double from today.

Furthermore, what’s stopping BAT from resuming earnings growth, assuming the business environment recovers? Even if earnings grow by just equal to GDP growth (i.e. 4-5% a year), it would justify a 15x PE at the minimum considering a long-time horizon of 20-30 years. Combine a doubling of earnings with a 15x PE, and you’re looking at a potential quadrupling (4x) of the current share price. 

&nbsp;

**A Best-Case Scenario Valuation**

If BAT reclaims its former glory and returns to its historical market capitalization of RM 18 billion, we’re talking about a 600% increase in share price. 

That’s just for the next ten years. What about dividends beyond that? Let’s imagine the best possible scenario for BAT. Assume for awhile that you’re planning to hold BAT for the next 30 years. Assume also that in ten years’ time, BAT’s share price skyrockets to 600% of current levels, and then grows earnings by 4% a year into perpetuity and pays out 90% of earnings at dividends. Account for 3% inflation and zero percent cost of capital (i.e. growth funded from retained earnings). By the end of year 30, you’d end up with 27x your initial investment, or 2700% of your capital. That’s a 12% CAGR.

In other words, a $40,000 investment in BAT today could potentially yield a million dollars in 30 year’s time. And that’s with reasonable assumptions. Tweak the numbers further and you’ll could potentially reach Buffett-like returns. 

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

To sum things up, it appears that current share prices already impute the worst-case scenario, while the best-case scenario is a 600% capital appreciation potential in ten years, or 2700% over 30 years. Giving a margin of safety, let’s dial the ten-year return of 600% down by 50% - we still get a 300% reward scenario. That’s a 12% CAGR over ten years. Not too shabby.

Assuming 50% downside from today’s prices, the upside-to-downside ratio at 300% upside would still be a healthy 1:6. Now that’s a margin of safety.

If you believe that BAT has no future in Malaysia and will ultimately be acquired or liquidated, expect share prices to fall by up to 50% from here. If you expect that the legal industry will recover to former highs and that BAT is well-positioned as the largest cigarette player in an ASEAN country with 4% GDP growth (alongside Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia), you can expect share prices to rise by at least 300% over the next 10 years. 

More realistically, share prices will fluctuate by 20% from current levels both to the upside and downside over the next year or so. If you can stomach that kind of volatility, BAT makes for a wonderful risk-reward component of your hopefully diversified emerging market portfolio. 

&nbsp;

**A Value Investor’s Perspective**

As mentioned above, Warren Buffett has a history of buying companies for pennies on the dollar when the share price reflects maximum pessimism. This does not mean to dive blindly into freefalling stocks which you do not understand. It does mean that you should do your homework, and when you spot an attractive risk:reward ratio in stocks where others are running for the exits, you should be comfortable holding a large position. 

Buying a leading cigarette company in its market while it’s beaten down represents one of the most potentially profitable investments imaginable. For reference, take a look at Altria. If you had bought $1,000 worth of shares in Altria in 1970, and reinvested all the dividends, you would be sitting on a fortune worth $5 million by today. That’s an astounding 18% CAGR over an extraordinarily long period of 50 years. Can BAT Malaysia repeat this tier of performance? Probably not, but you don’t need to in order to make a satisfying profit from it. 

Buffett espouses thinking long-term when it comes to investing. Think about the long-term when it comes to BAT Malaysia. Is it likely that illegal cigarette’s share of the market will remain elevated at 65% or above for the next 20 years continually? If I was a betting man, I’d wager that it won’t. More likely than not, some kind of unforeseen development will unfold which will bring market share back into the folds of the legal industry – it could be vaping, HNB products, a newly yet unrevealed form of nicotine-device, or even an evolution in the way smokers think. What can be relied on however is that in 20 years smokers will still continue to view nicotine, and by extension smoking-related products, as a form of entertainment and relaxation. 

Then there’s the dividends. The dividend yield on one share of Altria bought in the 1990’s held until today would exceed 30%. This is because the dividends have grown over the years in tandem with earnings growth. Extrapolate that to BAT Malaysia, which currently has a dividend yield of 15%. Assuming an average of 4% earnings growth going forward, that dividend yield would grow to just about 45% in 30 years. That’s the power of compounding. 

Buffett also champions the idea of owning companies with fortress economic moats. Some of the companies which he owns have such moats, including Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, GEICO, American Express, etc. It’s hard to argue that BAT Malaysia doesn’t have such a moat. Even in such trying times where revenues have contracted by 20%, it still sports a high-flying ROE of 100%, and stable gross margins of 30%. I would go so far as to compare BAT Malaysia today to a Coca-Cola or American Express when Buffett bought them during times of pessimism. 

Think about the future of BAT in 10 years, or 20 years’ time. It’s likely that it will have overcome the temporary hurdles which it faces today by then and resume earning high returns on significant capital invested over a long period of time. This is truly a compounding machine if there ever was one. Or as the title suggests, a wonderful company trading at a wonderful price.

Remember that Buffett’s best buys in the public markets have all been investments made during trying times, such as what BAT is facing today. AMEX could have gone bankrupt over the Salad Oil Scandal. GEICO was literally months away from being unable to service its insurance liabilities. Goldman Sachs was teetering on the brink of financial collapse under the heavy weight of subprime mortgage obligations. Coca-Cola was not the company it is today – it was an overburdened, overdiversified conglomerate with little growth outlook. Wells Fargo was staring at a huge, unserviceable loan book immediately following the Californian earthquakes given its significant residential exposure. It’s definitely nice to pay fair prices for wonderful companies, but it’s even better to be able to pay wonderful prices for wonderful companies. 

&nbsp;

In times like these, it pays to reflect on some words of wisdom for guidance:

*Buy when there’s blood in the streets.*
 
*Be greedy when others are fearful.*

*In the short-term, the market is a voting machine; in the long-term, it is a weighing machine.*

*Price is what you pay, value is what you get.*

*It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.*

*Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.*

&nbsp; 

May the investing odds be ever in your favor!

t3_ex9ixl,"Question on Crowdfunding and the ""Crowd Note"" Security","TL;DR is this security worth anything if the company remains independent?

I've been looking at getting into equity crowdfunding via the [Microventures](https://microventures.com/) platform. Through this service, startups sell something called a ""crowd note"", which is like a [convertible note](https://www.seedinvest.com/blog/startup-investing/how-convertible-notes-work) in that it represents a promise of equity, pending a ""qualified equity financing"" event, e.g. a certain threshold of fundraising ([usually $1-2 million](https://www.cooleygo.com/frequently-asked-questions-convertible-debt/)).

However, unlike convertible notes, which must automatically convert to equity once the threshold is reached, crowd notes are converted by the company at its own option after the event. ([See the template legal document.](https://d2v4u62fw1nf2w.cloudfront.net/webapp-static/documents/SeedInvestCrowdNote.pdf)) Down the line, other events such as a merger, acquisition, or IPO of the company would force the crowd notes to automatically convert. (For a ""major investor"" who purchases 20,000ish+ crowd notes, qualified equity financing triggers conversion as with a regular convertible note. I'm not gonna be a major investor.)

Anyway, my question: Am I right to think that, barring an acquisition of some kind, the company can indefinitely decline to convert crowd shares? Thus, if it becomes profitable on its own and begins paying dividends, small investors will see nothing?",3,1.0,1580578295.0

t3_f38zzn,Security Analysis of HOLI,"**Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd. (HOLI)** 

HOLI is a leading provider of automation and systems solutions in China, with overseas operations in eight other countries throughout Asia. The majority of its business is done in the industrial automation (IA) and rail transportation sectors, though it has low-margin operations in mechanical & electrical (M&E) and medical solutions as well. A miniscule debt-to-equity ratio, healthy historical cash flows, promising growth based on planned expansion in relevant sectors, and the Great Wall of China doubling as an economic moat all suggest taking a long position while the stock price hovers near its 52-week low. 

***Business Profile***

Founded in 1993 and listed on NASDAQ since 2008, HOLI has grown from research team specializing in automation control in the power industry to a multinational company with customers in sectors including power, petrochemical, high-speed rail, and urban rail. In IA, HOLI provides automation hardware, software, and services spanning field devices, control systems, enterprise manufacturing management and cloud-based applications. In rail transportation, it provides advanced signaling control and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for high-speed rail and urban rail. 

HOLI designs and manufactures all its products in-house at its facilities in Beijing and Hangzhou. Its core hardware is a printed circuit board, manufactured and assembled at the two Chinese facilities. Raw materials include bare printed circuit boards and various electronic components needed for assembly. 

Approximately 82% of the company’s total consolidated revenues are derived from integrated solutions contracts won through the bid process. The remainder of revenue is generated through sales of spare parts, maintenance, and training services after the warranty period from the contracts has ended. 

Ok, I kind of get it. So why should I be interested?

1. **An Impeccable Balance Sheet:** After paying off its 20M convertible bond in Q1 of FY20, the company has total debt of only 2.5M. That’s good for a D/E ratio of 0.003, quite a bit lower than the 0.557 average of its competitors. It’s average OCF margin over the last three years is 19%, well above industry averages, and its average CFO/NI ratio over the same period is 0.99.
2. **Urbanization:** Rapid industrialization and warped demographics has manifested in dramatic urbanization and economic integration, which in turn creates a critical need for infrastructure. Grand infrastructure goals are what a planned economy like China does best. While the world awaits the details of the PRC’s 14th Five Year Plan, you can bet HOLI will be busy servicing Chinese needs for high-speed rail and subway transit.
3. **Limited Domestic Competition:** While large multinationals account for the majority of global automation market share, to the extent this is true in China does not extend to the verticals in which Hollysys makes most of its profits. Specifically, the high barriers to entry for servicing nuclear power plants and high-speed rail gives the company an enviable moat around a significant portion of its revenue share. 

***Valuation***

Currently, HOLI’s sustainable competitive advantage comes from its specialized offerings of high-speed rail signaling systems to ensure the safety of passenger train movement. The China Train Control System (CTCS) is a country specific high-speed rail standard and therefore is different from international standards propounded by European organizations or Japan. This barrier to entry makes HOLI the largest provider in a growing market. In fact, their 39% market share from 2015-2018 for total automatic train protection (ATP) sets sold made them the largest Chinese company in the domestic automation market. Rail is also the division in which the company has its highest profit margins.

HOLI’s revenue comes from three main offerings: IA, Rail, and M&E. Historically, the revenue share between the three divisions has been very stable: 40%, 36%, and 23%, respectively. In 2019 and 2018, the company had a GP% of 37% and 38%. Over those two years, IA posted a GP% of 41% and 40% while Rail posted a GP% of 48% and 52%. M&E were by far its lowest margin operations with a GP% of 13% both years. The company does not provide revenue figures by geographical area for each division, but it does break out total revenues by geographical area. We can infer from this breakout and from other financial and marketing materials that almost all IA and Rail revenue is derived from business in the PRC while M&E revenue is generated from its foreign subsidiaries in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Middle East. 

China’s high-speed railway operating mileage, currently the largest in the world, has grown from 19,000km in 2016 to 32,000km at the end of 2019, covering 80% of China’s major cities and surpassing the 30,000km goal by 2020 laid out under the 13th Five Year Plan. Though the details of infrastructure goals won’t be released until the next five year plan in 2021, high-speed rail is expected to be at least a $4.4 billion industry by 2023, with maintenance and replacement accounting for a rapidly growing share of expenditures. Higher growth is expected in the urban rail transit sector, which is expected to grow from 5,500km to 9,276km by 2023. In general, infrastructure needs are driven by the rapid urbanization and regional economic integration and is supported by ambitious policies such as the five year plans, Eight Horizontal and Eight Vertical High-speed Railway Corridors project, and the Belt and Road Initiatives. With its leading market share in these industries, HOLI is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. ­

China’s industrial automation market is similarly poised for accelerated growth. Total contract amount from industrial automation in China grew at a 4.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2014 to 2018 and reached a total value of $30.1 billion. The market is estimated to accelerate that growth to 11.1% CAGR from 2018 to 2023 and reach $50.6 billion. Over that same time, petrochemicals and power are expected to grow at CAGRs of 14.5% and 5.8%, respectively. While competition in the industrial automation market is stiffer, HOLI’s roots in automation for power and petrochemicals, growing name brand recognition in China, advanced technology, and cash-rich position give it a good position to increase its market share. Importantly, HOLI has a unique advantage when it comes to nuclear power. 

The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster threw a major wrench into China’s plans for nuclear power. To reassure the population that the country was not a risk of a similar catastrophe, the PRC placed a moratorium on the construction of new power plants. After lifting that ban in 2019, the country has 47 nuclear reactors in commercial operation, with twelve more under constructions and more on the way. The impetus for nuclear power in China has increased due to air pollution from coal-fired plants and as a result the country has subsidized nuclear power with an aim to match and surpass the world average of 15% for total electricity generated by nuclear power (currently at 4.75%). HOLI is the only qualified local automation and control product provider to the non-safety control for nuclear power stations. In the nuclear automation segment, HOLI competes with multi-national corporations such as Siemens, Areva, and Invensys, but with the abnormal glut in demand created by the Fukushima disaster HOLI has a prime opportunity to increase its market share.

The M&E division offers solutions through Concord and Bond Groups, two subsidiaries acquired by HOLI in 2011 and 2013, respectively, in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Hong Kong. While this division has the lowest revenue and profit margins in relation to the company’s other operations, it also offers its greatest opportunity for business expansion and diversification. A 2019 partnering with the London engineering consulting firm Arup signals a willingness to expand the M&E offerings, potentially through more acquisitions. While profitable, the revenues generated by this division do not significantly affect our valuation of the company. Barring any interesting acquisitions, the only growth we forecast for M&E is over the long-term.

An important measure in our valuation comes from HOLI’s dedication to research and development. Historically, the company spends 6-7% of revenue on R&D, and 40%, or 1,500 employees, of the 3,200 person company work in R&D. Their proprietary technology is at the center of their rail and power offerings – as of June 30, 2019, HOLI held 221 software copyrights, 126 authorized patents, 64 pending patent applications, and 44 registered trademarks. The Chairman and CEO, Shao Baiqing, has been with the company for more than 25 years starting as one of the founding engineers, and “is widely regarded as an industry leader with significant influence in China.” 

Despite the fact that EBITDA has grown over 60% since FY17, HOLI has an EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 3.  Not only is this well below the historical multiple for the company, it is also low enough to be a solid multiple for a coal company. Taking into account the growing industrial automation and high-speed transit sectors in China, while accounting for some slowdown in infrastructure spending in the current year as the window of the 12th Five Year Plan is closing having already surpassed expected rail mileage, we use a conservative estimate of 5% revenue growth rate YoY. We see no reason for net income growth to lag behind this rate. Using consistent conservative estimates to project unlevered free cash flow, and re-levering the beta to reflect average competitor beta, we arrive at a fair value of $25 per share, close to a 60% discount rate.

***Risks***

* Corona virus may mutate and spread, further depressing Chinese stock values for an unknown amount of time.
* Escalations by either the U.S. or China in their trade war could negatively affect trade relations or may cause further slowdowns in Chinese economic growth and depreciation of the RMB. This has the potential to adversely impact HOLI’s supply chain for its products and stifle the demand for capital projects and domestic investment in China.
* The Beijing and Hangzhou subsidiaries of Hollysys are recognized as high and new technology enterprises, or HNTEs, by the PRC government, which entitle each of them to a reduced income tax rate of 15% (compared to the statutory income tax rate of 25%). Additionally, HOLI received VAT refunds and government subsidies of $33 million in FY2019. If the HNTE status is not renewed for those subsidiaries, or the PRC stops recognizing HOLI as a qualified research and development enterprise deserving of VAT refunds, the result could have a material adverse effect on future operations.",14,1.0,1581595580.0

**Introduction**

Banca Sistema SpA (BST.MI) is an Italian small specialty bank, providing factoring services to suppliers of public administrations (64% of the company’s outstanding loan volume), salary and pension secured loans (31% of outstanding loan volume), as well as gold and jewelry backed loans. The company’s business segments are characterized by low risk (36 bps cost of risk) and relatively high returns (18% ROTCE). Total outstanding loan volume exceeds €2.6 billion.

Interests of shareholders and management are seemingly well aligned, with management owning a significant portion of the company. The ownership structure looks as follows: 38.4% of the company is owned by a shareholder’s agreement comprised of two banking Foundations (collectively 15.3%) and SGBS (23.1%), of which Gianluca Garbi, the CEO of the company, is the relative majority shareholder. The remaining shares (61.6%) are floating.[ Mr. Garbi acquired an additional 170,000 shares in June of 2019 at a price of around €1.14](https://bancasistema.it/pdf/internal_dealing/20190618_1501_Comunicazione_id_garbi.pdf), when the stock was near its all-time low to date. Other insiders have bought in August at prices between €1.25 and €1.30.

Since the stock was floated at the Borsa Italiana in 2015, Banca Sistema SpA has grown its assets by 75%, from €2 billion in 2016 to €3.7 billion in 2019. The profitability has been stable and growing, with net income of €26.4 million in 2016 and €29.7 million in 2019. Meanwhile, the stock price has fallen from €3.75 to around €1.90 during the same time period. For full year 2019, the company has managed to grow earnings by 9% and maintain a ROE above 18%, while being overcapitalized by more than €80 million on a pro forma basis. Evidently, there’s a divergence between fundamentals and stock price development, creating a bargain opportunity at low multiples of 5.14x earnings and 0.88x tangible book value.

**The Main Business – Factoring**

Factoring of receivables towards Italian public administration entities is the main business segment of Banca Sistema SpA. Customers are utilities and companies, who provide healthcare products and services, food, transport and entertainment to local state-owned healthcare companies, regions, municipalities and ministries. Due to structural reasons (bureaucracy as well as liquidity), Italian PAs are significantly slower to pay their open invoices than the EU average. In fact, out of all the EU countries,[ only Greece is slower to pay](https://www.intrum.com/media/5755/intrum-epr-2019.pdf).

[Source: European Payment Report 2019](https://preview.redd.it/7blcht8fi9i41.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=68fae5de7da97029427dce5c37f34ef15b53150f)

Although payment times have come down in 2019, it’s questionable how sustainable this new level is. Greece had improved its average payment time from[ 103 days in 2017 to 73 days in 2018, just to see it increase back to 115 days in 2019](https://www.intrum.com/media/5755/intrum-epr-2019.pdf). The reasons for these late payments are deeply rooted structural issues that have persisted for a long time. They will unlikely be solved overnight.

The profitability of the business comes from the ability to collect the purchased receivables faster and/or recover a higher value than the original creditor expected. The data driven underwriting is based on information about payment times from past collections with different public administrations. The company’s proprietary tools and comprehensive data basis are constantly fed with new data and enable them to effectively price receivables for profit. Payment times are accelerated by established relationships with key people at the PAs. 

The key particularity about this business is that the vast majority (84%) of obligors are public administrations; a reference market without default risk. Although payment time can be further delayed, if PAs enter into financial distress, the exposure to credit risk is not a concern, because public administration entities can’t default and are not subject to Italian bankruptcy laws. As long as the company doesn’t accept any haircut proposal, a full recovery of both capital and interest at the end of the financial distress is possible. There is only a time value effect due to the longer collection process.

The majority of factoring turnover of Banca Sistema SpA is non-recourse (62%), with recourse factoring representing 11% and tax receivables 27%.

**Favorable Market Backdrop and Legal Framework**

1. European Late Payment Directive (2011/7/EU)

To protect European businesses, particularly SMEs, against late payment, the EU adopted Directive 2011/7/EU on combating late payment in commercial transactions in February 2011.

Under this directive public authorities have to pay for the goods and services that they procure within 30 days or, in very exceptional circumstances, within 60 days. Companies are legally entitled to late payment interest from the day following the terms of contractual payment at a statutory interest of 8% above the ECB reference rate.

The late payment interest ([LPI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LPI)) is an incentive for the counterparty to pay the debt in time and negotiation lever for the company to get accelerated payment. If the payment is overdue, the LPI is accrued and eventually collected after legal action. For 2019, LPI from legal action has made up 36% of factoring interest income.

2. VAT Split Payment System

In January 2015, the Italian government first implemented the split payment method of VAT collection to combat VAT fraud and non-compliance, which has been extended since. In this system, VAT due from goods and services provided to public entities are directly paid to the Italian treasury and not the supplier.

The split payment method generates liquidity problems for public administration suppliers, as they find themselves in a permanent VAT credit position on transactions made with public entities. Companies subject to split payment continue to pay VAT to its suppliers, but no longer receives it from its customers, who pay the tax directly to the state. This mechanism creates an imbalance of incoming and outgoing cash flows, further amplified by the delays in obtaining VAT refunds, which, on average, takes 95 days. The increased volume of requests for VAT refunds that can now be filed quarterly to reduce the negative financial impact, is expected to lead to further payment delays. The total expected business opportunity for factoring providers created by the split payment system is estimated to be around €15 billion, according to a study by Bain & Company.

3. Growth of Government Spending

The European Commission’s spring 2019 forecast revealed that Italy will be the slowest growing economy in the EU during 2019. Technically, the country was in a recession in 2018, with two back to back quarters of negative GDP growth. With monetary policy being exhausted as a means to accelerate economic growth in the country, Italy has to turn to fiscal policy in order to support its economy. Italian government spending is projected to increase by almost €100 billion, or 2% per year, over the next five years, from €864 billion in 2019, to €957 billion in 2024. Government revenues are projected to increase roughly in line with spending[(€921 billion in 2024](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/italy/forecast-government-revenue)). Thus, even with no GDP growth (€2.076 trillion GDP in 2018), the projections do not imply a breach of the EU’s rules, by which member states are not supposed to run a budget deficit above 3% of its GDP.

[Source: International Monetary Fund – World Economic Outlook](https://preview.redd.it/fjhxsshli9i41.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=497d0ed70513691d23232cca0cc1aeb10afb716d)

The positive effect of increased government spending works in two ways for Banca Sistema SpA. First, more spending means more potential factoring volume in total. Second, more spending can result in higher payment times, because of the increased volume of payments that have to be processed; this in turn should create higher demand for factoring and enable more profitable underwriting (higher margins).

**Salary and Pension Secured Loans (CQ Loans)**

The Bank’s second largest line of business, with 31% of total outstanding turnover, is salary and pension secured loans. Loans outstanding have grown 25% y/y (FY19 vs FY18). It’s a lower margin business compared to factoring, with current net interest margins of 3.3% vs. 5,9% for factoring. However, secured loans are considered very low risk, because the borrower’s loan is repaid directly from their salary or pension by the employer or state pension body. The following attributes are additionally contributing to the low risk profile:

1. the monthly installment can’t exceed 20% of the salary/pension,
2. the loan takes precedence over any seizure of salary/pension amounts, and
3. insurance is mandatory by law and covers in case of death, disability and loss of job.

Moreover, out of the outstanding borrowers 50% are pensioners and 32% are employees of public entities. The probability of default ([PD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PD)) is very low and loss given default (LGD) is almost zero (thanks to the insurance).

Since the recent acquisition of the broker Atlantide, the company is able to originate the CQ loans themselves, instead of relying on intermediaries, like it has in the past. This will increase the net interest margin of the CQ business in the long run, although it might not have an immediate impact, because only 5% of the currently €817 million outstanding CQ loans are originated directly by the company.

**Gold/Jewelry Backed Loans**

The company has first tested this business in 2016 and has grown it organically as well as by way of acquisitions since. The pawn loan is a particular form of short-term loan with a collateral on property goods; the focus is on gold, jewelry, diamonds and selected watch brands. The gold and jewelry backed loans only make up a negligible portion of the total turnover, with €70 million in currently outstanding loans, even considering the recent acquisition of the gold/jewelry backed loan line of Intesa Sanpaolo SpA Group of €60 million in outstanding loans. This is not a business that many banks are focused on. Nonetheless, it’s characterized by very high returns and low capital absorption. The gross annual interest rate on the loans is 12-14% with 50% loan to value. Most pawns are paid back at the expiration date, between 5-8% are sold at auction. The majority of outstanding loans are backed by gold. Management has talked about prospects for double digit annual growth in this business segment in the Q4 2019 earnings call.

**Regulatory Capital Well Above Minimum Requirements**

The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio stands at 11.7% at year-end 2019, compared to the minimum requirement of 7.75%. Total Capital Ratio (TCR) at 15.0%, exceeds required minimum of 11.85% by similar amount.

Moreover, the European regulatory bodies have recently decided to[ reduce the risk weighting of CQ loans to 35% from 75%](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0876&from=EN), starting September 28, 2021. Since the CQ loans business makes up a significant part of the outstanding loans of Banca Sistema, at €817 million or about 42% of risk weighted assets, the new directive has a significant positive impact on the company’s regulatory capital ratios. Once the directive is officially implemented, the CET1 and TCR ratios for Banca Sistema will stand at 13.9% and 17.8%, before accounting for the most recent acquisition of the gold/jewelry backed loans business from Intesa Sanpaolo. In absolute terms, approximately €31 million of capital will be made available, 20% of the current market cap. The total capital surplus will add up to €87 million (pre acquisition), 57% of the current market cap. This large capital surplus makes the stellar returns on equity even more impressive. It will also enable accelerated growth in factoring and loan volume, additional acquisitions or a higher capital distribution to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

**Valuation**

As of my writing, the share price stands at around €1.90. With 80.3 million shares outstanding, the current market cap is €153 million. EPS for full year 2019 was recently reported at €0.37. That gets us to a P/E multiple of 5.14, implying a 19% earnings yield. The acquisition of the gold and jewelry backed loans from Intesa is expected to add approximately €3 million in annual profits, or €0.04 in EPS. Even with zero growth in the other lines of business, next year’s EPS could reasonably come in at €0.41. Based on the current stock price, the multiple on my conservative earnings estimate for 2020 stands at 4.63. That’s cheap by any measure and leaves a margin of safety for some unforeseen risks and uncertainties.

The company is also very cheap in terms of book value. Tangible book value per share for the most recent quarter is €2.16. At the current share price of €1.90, you get a discount to tangible book value, for a company earning a return on tangible equity above 18%.

Putting a more reasonable 10x multiple on net earnings, gets you to a share price of €3.70 on FY19 earnings and €4.10 on my conservative expectations for FY20 earnings. That’s an upside of around 100-130%. Following Warren Buffets logic of valuing J.P. Morgan at 3x tangible book value (18% ROTCE divided by his assessment of risk-free rate of 6% = 3), Banca Sistema should be worth more than 3x the current price.

**Regulatory Risk**

Two new EU regulations could potentially have an impact on Banca Sistema’s factoring business: the[ EBA guidelines on the definition of default](https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/1721448/052c260f-da9a-4c86-8f0a-09a1d8ae56e7/Guidelines%20on%20default%20definition%20%28EBA-GL-2016-07%29_EN.pdf?retry=1) and[ calendar provisioning](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/635553/EPRS_BRI%282019%29635553_EN.pdf). The risks emanating from the new regulations were previously discussed here on Seekingalpha.

Essentially, the regulations change the definition of default and the way the company has to treat its nonperforming exposures. By the new definition credit exposures that are due past 90 days are considered defaulted and have to be written off within 3 to 9 years depending on the type of exposure.

However, for exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector entities, which make up 84% of Banca Sistema’s factoring turnover, special treatment may apply, as long as:

1. the contract is related to the supply of goods and services,
2. the financial situation of the obligor is sound and there are no reasonable concerns that the obligation might not be paid in full,
3. the obligation is past due not longer than 180 days.

Fortunately, all criteria are met for most of Banca Sistema’s public sector exposures, because:

1. factoring receivables from suppliers of goods and services to public administrations is precisely what the company does.
2. PAs can’t default and are not subject to Italian bankruptcy law; thus, there is no concern that the obligation might not be paid in full.
3. the average payment time of Italian PAs was between 67 and 104 days during the last three years, well below 180 days.

From a pragmatic perspective, the change of the definition of default has no impact on the actual collectability of receivables towards public administrations. Bad loans from PA exposure have not led to actual losses for the company. Still, concerns remain that the new regulations will have an impact on the accounting (in terms of provisioning and write-offs) as well as the regulatory capital requirements, which could adversely impact returns on equity or even necessitate a capital increase, diluting current shareholders.

Meanwhile, the CEO has stated that the impact of the new regulation is very limited, if not zero, on the most recent Q4 2019 conference call. Although I’d normally be hesitant to take managements word at face value, the high insider ownership and further acquisition of shares, gives me a higher level of comfort.

**Why This Opportunity Exists**

Banca Sistema is a small, relatively illiquid, Italian bank stock. There are multiple factors depressing the current share price.

First, the European financial sector couldn’t be more hated by investors. The increased regulatory requirements since the Great Financial Crisis, paired with the sustained unfavorable interest rate environment in Europe, have greatly reduced the returns on equity European banks are able to generate. A traditional European bank is happy to earn 9% ROE these days. Banca Sistema has thus far been able to earn more than 18% ROE, in the same regulatory and interest rate environment, running a significant capital surplus. This is one of those cases, where the baby is thrown out with the bath water, creating an opportunity for the attentive investor.

Second, Italy has had its fair share of bad headlines in recent years: government crisis, low economic growth and a large government debt burden have weighed on Italian stock prices. Unsurprisingly, Banca Sistema hit its all-time low of €1.10 per share, in June of 2019, at the height of the government crisis.

Third, small cap value stocks, as a group, have had a historically bad run in recent years. The relative underperformance of small cap value has only been more extreme in 1929, right before the Great Depression, and in 1999, at the very top of the Tech Bubble. In the current environment, companies like Banca Sistema tend to stay undervalued for a while, and in many cases, continue to fall further and further in price, as funds get drawn out of value strategies and get reallocated to strategies that have performed best in the most recent past. With capital continuing to flow into ETFs, companies that are not included in the prominent indices lag behind the largest capitalization stocks - the biggest beneficiaries of the inflows, who move along the fund flows seemingly irrespective of fundamentals.

**Conclusion**

Over the long run, fundamentals matter; share price and value tend to converge and major mispricings are corrected. The catalysts can either be abrupt, like a private buyout or a large share repurchase, or more gradual, like continued showings of good business fundamentals and high shareholder yield over time.

I think the latter is more likely for Banca Sistema, although a buyout or some other M&A event is certainly not out of the realm of possibilities. If the company continues to prove its earnings power over the long term, compounding its equity at a high rate, the stock price will eventually meet its intrinsic value. In the meantime, you’ll receive a decent dividend yield of around 5%, at a conservative payout ratio of just 25%. This is the type of company that I wouldn’t mind owning even if I couldn’t get a quote on my shares for the next 10 years. Your incentives are aligned with Gianluca Garbi, the CEO and single largest shareholder, who presumably has the majority of his net worth tied up in the company. He has every incentive to not only run the company well operationally, but to also eventually bring share price and value into alignment, if the gap doesn’t close organically over time.",47,0.9,1582284596.0
t3_f8flt8,Turtle Creek vs Chuck Akre,"I just finished reading the [Turtle Creek communications](http://www.turtlecreek.ca/canadian-residents/communications). They're quite interesting. One thing that stands out to me is how different their approach is to that of Chuck Akre in that Turtle Creek rebalances often, whereas Chuck Akre almost never sells. Both have similar returns.

What I don't understand about Turtle Creek's approach is the tax implications. Are their funds tax-advantaged in some way, or are Canadian taxes significantly different from those in the US? In the US, frequent rebalancing would seem to lead to a fairly significant reduction in performance due to a 20-37% taxable event on each sale. That's a huge impact to long-term compounding.

I’m asking specifically about a talented but not professional small individual investor aiming to beat the market over a 10+ year time horizon using Buffett-style fundamental analysis and a buy and hold approach.  Some of the arguments I’ve heard for why a person should be able to beat the market with this approach even though active fund managers largely can’t:

* Very low AUM means access to a much larger opportunity set, some of which faces far less competition from smart money.
* Very low AUM means you can get into and out of positions without affecting the market price.
* Individuals are free of various regulatory constraints that fund managers face.
* Two specific characteristics of security analysis make it more conducive to being done on an individual basis: It may take years for the market to recognize the value in a stock that it has been underpricing.  And value investing necessarily requires a concentrated portfolio.  Put those two together and you have a recipe for shake out in most fund management situations.  This severely limits the amount of competition faced by the solo investor on many of the best opportunities.

Maybe the last one is the key.  Buy and hold differs from trading in that respect.  With trading, professionals with superior skill, resources, information, etc face no such impediment, because trading is supposed to show its true colors on a relatively short time frame.  In contrast to the Buffett approach, I don’t see a case for why industry wouldn’t devour pretty much every solo trader and diy quant.

t3_fc7dt6,Preferred stock opportunities?,"Preferred stocks have been trading at low yields given the low interest rates. PGF, PFF and PGX are the obvious ETFs. They only yield around 5% to 5.5%+, which is quite low compared to high yield bonds, though preferreds from IG (bank) credits may be better than HY bonds.

Instead, I've been looking at some of the more small issuers from smaller sectors (REITs, BDCs, shipping). Some names have traded down quite a bit with the recent market volatility, particularly as liquidity is thin in most of these names. Yields continue to be low in a lot of the names for the amount of risk, which makes sense, but I think there could be some value.

With the interest rates at new lows, does an allocation to these lower-grade preferreds make sense now? Any preferreds you are holding or looking at?

I do see that some preferreds in these sectors come with some really unique structures (fixed-to-float, explicit maturity, step-up in coupon (possibly acting as ""soft"" maturity), board member right if not redeemed in X years, etc.). Many of these are likely used to entice investors in small issuers with sketchy balance sheets. But in some ways, some preferreds may have structural protection that make them almost bond-like.

t3_fewwgq,Its just a flu bro,"Now that I got your attention with this catchy title, allow me to make the argument that this new corona virus is presenting us with the buying opportunity only seen once a decade or so. With travel and energy related stocks selling off like the next recession will happen, I think it is worth estimating how bad this new corona virus really is. 

So far people are freaking about CFR (mortality rate), and comparing early estimates in China of 2.3% with regular flu, which is closer to 0.1%. The Spanish Flu had a mortality rate of around 2% as well.

I will give some reasons why both early Covid-19 mortality rate is overstated, and why flu mortality rate would be understated if it was discovered today.

**Comparing different types of data sets**

First let us look at flu data here:

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm

As you can see in 2017/2018, CFR for flu was actually 0.15% (see second table). But this was for all estimated cases! This seems to hover between 0.10-0.16%. 

Now deaths are far more unlikely to go unreported than mild or asymptomatic cases. Because death is generally preceded by severe symptoms.  Especially since mild symptoms resemble regular cold symptoms so much.

Note that if influenza were just discovered, most of the reported cases would probably be hospital visits. And most of the vulnerable people would go to the hospital first. And CFR could easily be several % as well then.

Current data for the covid-19 virus is confirmed deaths/confirmed cases. And this does not include estimated cases! For example by large scale anti body testing you can estimate real amount of flu infections. These tests are not available yet for covid-19.

Now let's look at age. A sample of 42k cases in China shows that only about 2% are under 18.

https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf

And what is interesting is that outside Hubei (where much more random testing has happened, with much less incentive to cover it up), CFR was only 0.4% over 11k cases. (see page 4 of that report on top).

What is CFR for influenza for people over 18? 0.26%! And actually 42% of underage people got regular flu.

On top of that, only 1% was found to be asymptomatic in the Chinese data set, with a much higher % for regular flu (about 20%). And in this Korean sample about 26% of total infected was asymptomatic (where much more random testing happened):

https://twitter.com/BBCLBicker/status/1233701679586922498

Speaking about Korean sample, only 5% of infected were 18 or younger. For regular flu, this group is the one with a mortality rate of almost 0% (so far not much different among small group of underage with covid-19 virus).

source: http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200303000714

Currently CFR in Korea is 0.68% with only 0.5% in critical condition:

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

With almost 180k people tested, of which about 3.7% were found to be infected:

https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030

So if we adjusted, and divided 0.68% by 1.6 (since about 40% of regular flu patients are under 18), we get a CFR of 0.42%. Not that different from the CFR for regular flu of 0.26%.

If you adjust for vaccinations (which are not yet available for this virus), CFR starts to look pretty similar.

**What about Italy?**

Well, they are not testing on a large scale in Italy, only 23k tested yet, with more than 10x number of critical patients vs Korea. They are not testing people the infected have been in contact with. And are not doing much to contain it. And as of a couple days ago, all deaths were older than 55, and most were even older than that with underlying conditions. This is similar to the regular flu, where CFR goes up exponentially past age of 60:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/italy-elderly-population-coronavirus-risk-covid-19

>The virus has killed 79 people in Italy, overwhelmingly aged between 63 and 95 with underlying serious illnesses.

>The youngest patient to die was 55 and suffering from chronic disease.


So one thing that stuck out in past epidemics, is the large number of younger people (especially in 20-50 age range) that got killed. Especially in the Spanish flu, but also in the 1957 and 1968 outbreak. So far looking at data, this is not the case for this particular strain. 

**Mortality rate among old people**

Mortality rate among people 65+ in the Chinese data set (which I find highly questionable, since majority is Wuhan cases and CFR is so much higher vs Korean and Diamond Princess data set) has average mortality rate of 8% in 65+ demographic. This compares to a 65+ mortality rate of 0.8% with regular flu.

BUT this includes vaccinations for regular flu (a large majority of 65+ people vaccinate). Which lessens symptoms and prevents altogether. And it excludes asymptomatic cases. 

And the Diamond Princess data set (which is more reliable since they were isolated and entire population was tested regardless of symptoms, and there were no Chinese communist party officials invovled) actually suggests much lower mortality rates:

https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html

>The data from the Diamond Princess suggest an eightfold lower mortality amongst patients older than 70 and threefold lower mortality in patients over 80 compared to what was reported in China initially. 

An 8 fold lower CFR for 70+ would mean roughly a 1.1% CFR for 70+. Which seems to be in line with regular flu? And this is without a vaccine, and in sub optimal cramped conditions!

And what is worth mentioning:

>Not a single Diamond Princess patient under age 70 has died. 

Out of almost 700.

**Weather**

So if you look at a [weather map](https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FwxnrGsv-B3urh9HEnOadek7D3QuCSV6Eflh9P4-kR_s.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D71c2438ae2184fb01780e76c9719e87ba25c590f) you will see that there is not a single warm country where the virus has spread aggressively (note that Iran is mostly green on that map). I would think tens of thousands of cases would be hard to cover up.

Millions of Chinese have traveled to Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Africa, and there are barely any cases in those countries.

This seems to line up with regular flu which largely recedes in warm weather for various reasons.

[Note amount of flu cases by month in US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness#/media/File:WhoLab15.GIF). We are now going into week 11 this year. So that means roughly 4 more vulnerable weeks, but growth rates of how this spreads should go down rapidly in next 2 months. Which gives time to find a vaccine. And time to analyze data and get a more complete picture of CFR (which is much more likely to go down than up). 

**implication for investing**

Well the implication here is that this will likely be a non event in the coming year. In summer most cases likely go away, and panic largely recedes. Maybe a couple of months of disruptions, but my guess is that the general public will figure out what I have just outlined in my post in the coming months. And when that happens, equities are likely to snap back up. Especially stocks in risk areas. And people will just continue going about their day. Given how far some stocks have fallen, I would think this presents a pretty amazing investment opportunity.",89,0.72,1583596295.0

When calculating the fair market value of the land, I used the CBRE Q4 2019 report and took the average net sale price per sqft for industrial land in London, Ontsrio. As someone who lives in Ontario, I can confidentially say that using the industrial sale price of London land as a comparable for Hamilton is very conservative. I have calculated the following:

$75 for the average net sale price per sqft x 800 acres of land they own x 43,560 (acres to sqft) = $2.6 billion - $1.144 billion of total liabilities = $1.47 billion of liquidation value

The company is trading for $6.60 or $600 million. It is trading for less than half of its liquidation value.

I didn't even place any value on the cash and other assets it owns, and I didn't take into account the competent CEO Alan Kastenbaum. Also, they still operate a profitable steel mill, which means that the liquidation value will not be diluted.

Am I missing something here because this seems like a bargain to me.",22,0.91,1583559388.0
t3_ffldnl,Independently verified performance tracking,"Hello - I manage my personal savings through a brokerage account at Fidelity. Over the past few months, my family and a few close friends have asked about pooling their money alongside mine so they wouldn't have to worry about managing it.

I'm considering putting together a small partnership so we can pool the capital into one account and have defined rules around redemptions, contributions, etc..

It is still very early but a few friends/family members have asked about my performance data, volatility of returns, etc.. Up to this point, I've just been tracking that all in Excel using the numbers from Fidelity's site. I'd like to present something more impartial/standardized, and I find the reports on Fidelity to be very limited and not transparent enough.

t3_flh0fh,$CIM Long Thesis (Sketchy Executive Stock Grants Analysis),"Yesterday (March 18th), we found that Chimera Investment Corp ([$CIM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim/)) made a very unusual stock grant to their executives. Chimera had already granted the executives their yearly awards in January and February but then decided to make a 3rd grant in March (which has never been done before), with no explanation, and at prices 55% below their stock price just 1 month ago (and below their closing price on March 18th, the day the awards were granted).

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim?ltr=1):

>Chimera Investment Corporation operates as a real estate investment trust in the United States. The company, through its subsidiaries, invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities secured by pools of commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and other real estate related securities.

First things first, like many companies, Chimera has been crushed by the market over the last month (-55%). They also were having an extremely rough day on March 18th with the stock bottoming out at $6.50, 47% below the opening price. However, the stock rebounded back up to $9.98 (18% below the opening price) after they put out a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200318005591/en/) basically saying that they have repurchased $22M of shares since announcing a $150M buyback plan five days ago, that they have the technology for all of their employees to work effectively from home, and that their executives and directors have been purchasing stock.

Looking at their [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=1409493&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0) activity, we don’t yet see any executives or directors purchasing any stock, but we do see a whole bunch of stock grants being awarded to most of their executives and one of their directors. It is possible that their purchasing activity just hasn’t yet been posted by the SEC, so we will keep an eye out for that.

Stock grants on their own aren’t unusual, but it is unusual to grant stock for a 3rd time in Q1 when the company has never done that before and is near its all-time low. Looking at Matthew Lambiase’s (CEO) [grants](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getowner&CIK=0001419165) for the last few years, we see that he (and the other executives) typically receive stock grants in either January or February (or both) but never in March.

Digging a little deeper into the awards, we find that everyone except the Chief Legal Officer received pretty substantial 6-figure award amounts. With the closing price on March 18th being $9.98, these executives/directors also received some pretty nice discounts on their grants.

However, as the table below shows, all of them are well above their required holdings except for the Chief Legal Officer who is substantially below his requirements. However, they gave the Chief Legal Officer much less stock than everyone else and not nearly enough to put him over his requirements (we did not include the stock they were just granted on March 18th and made the stock price the same as their grant price). While it is possible that they were granting this stock to ensure that all of the executives and directors stay above their ownership requirements, it seems highly unlikely.

## Conclusion

These stock grants check a lot of boxes for an “unusual award”. The executives had already received their yearly rewards, they gave no explanation for this award, they granted the stock near the lowest prices possible, and the awards weren’t necessary to push the executives over their ownership guidelines.

There is the possibility that this is them just putting on a show to try to prevent their stock from declining further, but it would be a fairly pricey show especially when you consider the $155M of share repurchases they are doing.

Another, potentially more likely, possibility is that the company and executives believe the stock is undervalued and they are grabbing the stock at a discount.

Obviously, none of us know how long this market crash will last, but it may be worth keeping an eye on Chimera Investment Corp ([$CIM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim/)) as a company worth picking up at these low prices.",23,0.82,1584649226.0
t3_flgg9o,Long cruise stock thesis,"I was reading a fascinating blog post bringing a rare glimpse into the insights of the cruise charter business:  
   
https://www.myvacaya.com/the-charter-cruise-resort-business-a-primer/

Vacaya is a new all-gay full-ship cruise and land resort charter business. Their only competitors is [Atlantis Events.](https://atlantisevents.com/) 

Apparently cruise-ship charter terms are very hard-line and non negotiable. Pandemic is actually one of the clauses in the contract that is specifically called out - no refunds for a pandemic to the charter companies:

> The Charter Contract
>Charters are not part of a cruise line’s standard week-to-week business of selling cruises to the general public. It’s a carve out, run by its own department with its own executives, budgets, sales force, sales goals, operations team, etc. And this one aspect of our relationship with the cruise lines is the one that’s causing most of the confusion as it relates to all that’s going on with Covid-19. Because cruise lines have carved out charters as a separate business, we don’t get the same benefits the general public would get in regard to the rebooking terms and conditions the cruise lines are offering to their standard (read non-charter) passengers. We are being held to a different set of terms. And frankly, they’re not very forgiving.

>In fact, “pandemic” is a specific call out where most of the cruise lines ultimately bear no responsibility whatsoever – creating a sort of “like it or lump it” scenario. So we’re having to have very complicated conversations – ones where relationships are worth their weight in gold – with multi-billion dollar corporations whose charter business is a locked revenue stream for them, not subject to the ups and downs of standard sales (since the contracts are guaranteed so far in advance). These cruise line’s guaranteed charter revenue is sometimes used to balance losses the company might face elsewhere (for instance, during these Covid-19 days where they’re having to give so much back to their non-charter guests). So the cruise lines hold to those contractual guarantees with a tight grip, holding nearly all the cards over the charter companies.

>It’s a really tricky position for us to be in – caught in a strange in-between. These large corporations can afford to have a bad year. Sure, their shareholders might not like it, but they’re built to withstand even major business disruptions. But make no mistake about it, the cruise lines will lose countless millions here. But… and it’s a big but… they are all likely to weather this particular storm. Charter companies like VACAYA are in a much different spot – unable to amortize losses across fleets of ships sailing week in and week out like the cruise lines can. We are an event company – with set events throughout the year. So we have to approach these challenge in a different way. And our challenges are myriad.

# Summary
In general, chartering cruises has become massively popular. There's all kinds of cruise ship charters - nude cruises, star trek, huge EDM parties, etc. Cruise ships have tons of guaranteed revenue from the charters. Unlike other businesses they had the foresight to prepare for pandemics.",10,0.78,1584647379.0
t3_flavme,Carmax (KMX) Short Thesis,"Sorry for the poor formatting. I'm a Finance major who had his semester cut short. I'm doing this write up on Carmax ticker(KMX) as just a little practice putting my thoughts into words. I know my sources and stuff should be formatted better. All data related to Carmax was taken from the EDGAR database form 10-K related to fiscal year 2018.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional advisor and all decisions are your own. I have a current short KMX position. 

There is currently a liquidity crunch happening in financial markets that is causing massive sell offs in all asset classes. Today 3/18 we saw bonds, commodities, and equities all take steep losses as investors race for cash. The Federal reserve has been injecting liquidity into repo markets for the last few months. This is significant because banks and other institutions can’t get enough cash. We’ve also seen many companies start to draw down their credit lines even if they don’t need it yet because many are forecasting tough times ahead and see increasing demand, so they want to secure their slice now. Cruise lines, amusement parks, airlines, and many more industries impacted by the spread of Novel Coronavirus will be relying on credit to survive and will make it more difficult for the regular credit market to function as they take on more and more debt and take liquidity out of the market. 

What’s even worse is safety measures are causing large disruptions in the global economy. China, a global growth leader, is predicting a contraction in Q1 2020. U.S GDP growth is mostly fueled by the service sector which is being hit the hardest by “social distancing”. According to Forbes 78% of American workers live paycheck to paycheck. https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/01/11/live-paycheck-to-paycheck-government-shutdown/#22d7cad14f10 Now even regular citizens are going to feel the effect of this liquidity crunch.

This means after this week most Americans will be surviving on credit and any assistance congress provides which won’t be much. The priorities of the American worker will be for rent, food, and other necessities which is apparently toilet paper. A car would already be at the bottom of the payments list in hard times, but now Americans won’t even need it to get to work since they can’t leave their houses.


Now for a little background on why this is significant. Auto manufacturers recovering from the Great Recession in 2008 had to find a way to boost new auto sales. The easy money offered by quantitative easing made this possible. However, banks after 2008 were more cautious/constrained by government rules. Instead the origination of these loans shifted to the Finance sector notably these large auto manufacturers in-house financing arms. 
50% of these loans originated by these in-house financing divisions are sub-prime! https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2019/02/21/debunking-the-auto-loan-delinquency-crisis/#44443ed312f8 

This comes from the ironically titled Forbes article “Debunking the Auto Loan Delinquency ‘Crisis’”. “While it's true that 50% of auto finance companies' loans go to sub-prime borrowers (who have higher default rates), overall those lenders account for just 12% of all outstanding auto loan balances, and just 26% of the outstanding loans to sub-prime borrowers.” That means 50% of their loans are sub-prime and that only accounts for 26% of the sub-prime loans in the market. Ron Shevlin then goes on to talk about the uptick is in defaults is relatively inconsequential as delinquency rates are still relatively low even in sub-prime during the largest and longest expansion in recent memory, but they’re still rising. An argument can be made these lenders can afford to make riskier loans because this isn’t like the mortgage crisis, cars are easy to repossess and sell wholesale to recoup losses and these people need their cars for work, family, etc.

We have people making six figures that are in debt up to their eyeballs with no cash reserves to fall back on and a $60,000 truck they have to make payments on every month. (Anecdotal)




Now back to why this is all relevant. As Americans start to feel the effect of the liquidity crunch, layoffs, and overall contraction from the Coronavirus, what will be one of the first bills they stop paying during stressful financial times when they are stuck at home anyway? Their auto loans. Not even just sub-prime, they’ve been making poor loans to people for years and remember 78% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck at the height of U.S economic expansion and lowest unemployment in recent memory. Not to mention in February 2019 this happened. 
https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/auto-loan-delinquencies-rise/ 

“Auto loan delinquencies surge past Great Recession rate” This is while things were still good. It’s important to note this is backwards looking at 2018 Q4. The rise in subprime auto loan delinquency has been coming for awhile behind the scenes. This is demonstrated in this statistic showing that 90+ day delinquencies have been on the rise since bottoming out at 3.37% in 2015. 
https://www.statista.com/statistics/681294/share-of-90-delinquent-auto-loan-balances-usa/ 

The 4.47% in 2018 is .53% higher than 2008 and only slightly lower than the 4.92% in 2009.
What happens now when this wave of auto defaults take place? Well first of all its going to be huge seeing as Americans have over 1.2 Trillion is auto loan debt in February 2020 according to Investopedia. It is 10% of household debt which is third by size behind only mortgages (which we know can have huge upticks in delinquency rates) and student loans. 
https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/american-debt-auto-loan-debt/ 
Whoever owns these loans whether it’s the financing division at these auto manufacturers or investors in asset backed securities are going to experience drastic delinquency rates. So, they are going to repossess all of these cars at the same time. Now they are going to be dumping supply into the used car market creating greater losses for themselves as demand slows at exactly the same time. 

The largest purchasers of these repossessed cars and cars coming off lease are at auction from big used car sales lots. The biggest publicly traded example is Carmax, Inc. (KMX). Who has been working with Net Income percentages under 5% for the last 3 years and at 3.9% for 2016 and 2017 and 4.6% in 2018. 
Carmax utilizes the same system to sell their cars by financing sub-prime auto loans. Only its worse because the creditworthiness of these customers is even worse. The company may seem cushioned by its Total Assets of $18.7 billion and Total Liabilities of $15.35 billion. Until it’s acknowledged that $12.43 billion of those assets are receivables on auto loans and they hold $14.2 billion in debt on their balance sheet. Not to mention that the $12.43 billion book value on their loans will be severely impaired when the value of these cars on their lots starts to plummet as the default wave intensifies and they are forced to write down receivables values. Also, these big sellers have no one to wholesale their cars to after, they’re the usual buyers. Couple this with slowing demand, a drastic spike in supply, and their tight profit margins and it is looking very bleak. 
Free cash flows are already very low for Carmax. Cash flows from the operating activities have been negative in 2016 and 2017 which means they’re not even getting any liquidity from their auto sales. All of the cash comes in from the financing activities which will be the first to dry up. Then more debt must be taken on to stay afloat. But there is already $14.2 billion in debt on the balance sheet . And of the 18 billion in assets they have $14.95 billion in assets is based on the book value of these autos that are sure to decline during economic hardship especially after a wave of auto loan defaults that immediately lower their value and saturate the market further depressing used car values and impairments to the balance sheet. 

Carmax only has a market capitalization of 7.878 billion but 15 billion in debt and highly vulnerable assets there is a significant bankruptcy risk here. The free cash flow to debt ratio is 40,479,000/14,447,669,000 = .0028018. Not exactly what you’re looking for in the middle of a liquidity/credit crisis.

The broad market sell-off in recent weeks has provided numerous opportunities across sectors, and one interesting space has been yield-driven investments such as BDCs. Not only have the equity markets in this space fallen off in a flight to safety, but so too have the publicly traded bonds. The high level thinking makes sense: 1. investors in fixed income funds and ETFs are selling, creating outflows and mandatory redemptions; 2. yield-based investors feel the go-forward dividends in BDCs are unsustainable; 3. BDCs are often exposed to riskier, smaller businesses that are less likely to survive the coming months.

Numerous BDCs have seen their baby bonds drop into the $15-20 range ($25 par), inferring an impaired expected recovery value between 60 and 80 cents on the dollar. For more levered BDCs, the valuation is reasonable after factoring in a 20-30% haircut to the portfolio fair value and performing a waterfall analysis. But for conservative balance sheets, such as Capital Southwest’s, the sell-off is overstated.

As of 12/31/19, Capital Southwest has $500m of investments (excluding its JV with Main Street) and $273m of total long-term debt, for an asset coverage of over 180%. Further, it’s a high quality portfolio: 74% of its assets are first lien paper and the industry exposure to coronavirus high impact areas is limited. Consumer industries, restaurants and energy represent 14% of the book. Most of its portfolio is comprised of business services, healthcare services, media, software and financial services, which are more insulated from consumer-related cyclicality. The capital structure is comprised of a $124m senior revolver and two subordinated baby bond issuances ($76m 2022 and $73m 2024).

So the crux of the analysis is this: in a performing market, these bonds will be valued at par. This clearly is not a performing market, but let’s look under the hood. As a debt investor by nature, conservatism is the name of the game. So let’s look at a few scenarios:

1. A 70% recovery on its first lien loans, 50% recovery on its second lien/subordinated, and 0% on equity gives us an asset fair value of $310m, plus $23m of cash, well in excess of the last debt dollar of $273m, implying a full recovery for the baby bonds.

2. A 50% recovery on the entirety of the portfolio yields a $273m valuation ($250m+$23m cash), or ~100cents on the dollar. This is still a premium over the current trading price of $20 per share. Moreover, this is quite a pessimistic case considering most investments are first lien and being lent at 3-4x. There aren’t too many businesses out there that, if sold, would fetch <3-4x, leading me to believe that these first lien investments would still recovery most of their principal should the underlying businesses be sold.

3. Precedent transaction. In 2009, Patriot Capital Funding was under significant distress and faced a capital call from its lender. It elected to sell to Prospect Capital for $197 million, or 75% of the investment portfolio fair value. This not only resulted in 100% recovery rate for the debt holders ($110.5m outstanding), but also generated returns for the equity holders!


So in short, we are looking at a 6% coupon with 25% additional capital upside over 2.5 years. That’s a 16% IRR with what I believe is minimal downside based on the cases outlined above. It would take significant fair value erosion (>50%) to the underlying investment portfolio for a loss of capital to baby bond holders.

Risk Areas:

- The baby bonds are unsecured and junior to the revolver, meaning that they have fewer protections and are repaid after the revolver in any forced liquidation. There are asset coverage tests in place that could be tripped in the event of a significant portfolio mark-down. The current test is 150%, or 66.7% debt to fair value. A forced liquidation, while unlikely, could result in firesale prices below a reasonable recovery amount.

- Refinance risk. BDCs rely on debt to fund investments, so there’s a risk they cannot refinance this debt when it comes due in Dec 22 if performance continues to suffer.

- Manager underperformance – capital erosion from poor investment decision making over time.

- Coronavirus causing a >50% haircut to portfolio.

Catalysts:

1. Tender offer. BDCs may issue tender offers to repurchase these notes at a discount to book an immediate realized gain if they have excess cash on hand. Prospect Capital announced one last week. While this may not provide full upside as a redemption at face, it is a potential catalyst for upside.

2. Upcoming 10-Q reporting in coming weeks. The FV marks for many BDCs will serve as re-pricing opportunities for their stocks and bonds.

3. General portfolio performance over 2020/2021. These bonds are due at the end of 2022, <3 years from now, which is a natural catalyst in itself. If they are not refinanced before then, I would expect that the price would trade back to par at some point within the next two years as the coronavirus situation plays out and its impact to fair value is known.",6,0.76,1584916669.0
t3_fn3m90,A quick intrinsic value estimate of Berkshire Hathaway,"This morning I listened to the most recent episode of The Investor's Podcast, on which they mentioned the drop in price of BRK. They said they would cover an intrinsic value calculation on next week's episode, so I wanted to take a quick stab myself here and see what we get. *This is just for me to enhance my own valuation ability and to start a conversation, it certainly should not be considered as advice for others.*


As Warren Buffett himself has said, one should value BRK by looking at the operating earnings of the businesses it owns as well as the after-tax profit that would be made from a sale of its equity portfolio. Additionally, BRK has significant excess cash.


**Operating earnings (excluding Heinz)**

Revenue=$255bn

Costs=$226bn

Tax rate=21%

Earnings=$22.8bn

+non-Heinz equity method earnings=$683m

Earnings=$23.5bn


**Investments (including Heinz)**

At cost=$110bn

At year-end=$258.5bn

Today (assuming 15% unknown shares follow S&P YTD trends)

Est. value=$166bn

Tax on sale=21% * gains of $56bn=$11.8bn

Value to shareholders=$155bn


**Excess cash**

Buffett stated that they won't buyback shares if it would leave them with less than $20bn in cash. Let's assume that number represents the minimum they need to operate.


Cash, cash equivalents & fixed income=$146.7bn

-$20bn operating cash

Excess cash=$126.7bn


If we value the after tax operating earnings at 10X, we get an intrinsic value for BRK of $493bn, comprising:

Earnings power=$235bn

Excess cash=$127bn

Portfolio value=$155bn


At a market cap of $418bn, this leaves us with a discount of 19%.


An alternative lens through which we can view the valuation is to assume that the market values BRK's equity positions and cash at market rate (minus tax on the capital gains of equities). With that assumption, operating earnings are currently available for sale at a PE multiple of 5.8.


**Problems with this approach**

We’re not following Buffett’s proposed owner earnings approach. If maintenance capex is significantly higher than the stated depreciation then we would be overstating the value.


Without trying to appraise each of the wholly-owned companies individually, it is hard to know what they would sell for, as such a 10X multiple may be the wrong metric to use here.

In reality, BRK couldn’t exit out of their equity portfolio without severely damaging the value of the equities they hold in the process. Therefore, if we or BRK believe that Kraft Heinz or any other of their equities will diminish in the future, we would expect the intrinsic value to suffer as a result.


**Outcome**


At this point in time, I would seriously consider purchasing stock in BRK if the share price dropped by around 10-15%, (BRK.B price of around $155 or below).


My next step will be to continue looking at other companies for even greater discounts, whilst also working to generate a better valuation multiple for BRK’s operating businesses, looking for any discrepancies between reported earnings and owner earnings that would significantly alter this valuation and aiming to generate my own intrinsic value assumption for some of BRK’s bigger holdings.


I'm keen to receive all (preferably constructive) criticism on this approach and to hear your own valuations of the company.",24,0.88,1584899017.0
t3_fnl2zl,My View on Weyerhaeuser ($WY),"There's blood in the water these days and I've been itching to get back into active investing. Deals are everywhere and I wanted to share one that I've personally acted on with y'all!

**DISCLAIMER: I have a long position in $WY & the stuff below is just my opinion, not actual investing or financial advice.**

So Weyerhaeuser is a vertically integrated timberlands REIT. Their business is acquiring, managing, and cultivating timberlands to sell directly to manufacturers of wood products or manufacture wood products themselves. In terms of scale, [they're the largest by nearly 6x in acreage](https://www.statista.com/statistics/623363/leading-timberland-owners-in-the-united-states-by-land-ownership/) \- $RYN is a far second. I believe this is quite valuable as wood is a commodity and keeping costs down is key to profitability and $WY's scale can be viewed a competitive advantage.

Over the past five years the company has been doing roughly $1B in CFO annually and is currently trading at \~$11B market cap. Their stock price has dipped 50% from Feb 21st - Mar 20th - mostly because they do depend heavily on the health of the US economy (specifically residential real estate activity) for their business.

Although the dip is expected, I believe the market might have overreacted here. My underlying macro thesis is that COVID-19 is an unforeseen shock, but one that doesn't affect the underlying factors of economic production. If you look at the three main factors (labor, capital stock, and productivity), I believe only labor will be affected. And marginally at that via young folks with underlying medical conditions. The other [major risk group (seniors 65+)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm) could effectively be considered already out of the labor force.

Even if we assume that the next two years will be $0 or negative cash flows, the majority of the value will still be captured in the ongoing business which has demonstrated a pre-COVID potential of $1B in CFO. Now - will it be ongoing? Well...

The big risk I see for the company is that their balance sheet leaves something to be desired. They have roughly $6.1B in debt with only $140M in cash. They also have a rough historical interest rate on debt of 6% and the first big principal repayment is coming up in 2021. If they can't refinance the debt or deal with the interest payments as a result of a prolonged recession, then they are in serious trouble.

But will a prolonged recession come to pass? My bet is no. People are definitely talking about it now, but as I mentioned above - the effects of COVID on the economy should be short-run. However, if people believe a recession is coming, then they may shift from consumption / investment to saving prematurely thereby triggering an actual recession.

It's a big assumption to make, but one that I'm comfortable with.

Some other data points to consider:

* [30-yr](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US) and [15-yr](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE15US) mortgage rates at all-time lows

In bad times, they drop the rate to encourage economic activity. 

All that makes sense to me, but why has it trended down for such a long history of time? 

Is it that the Fed didn't have everything quite figured out in the 80's and that was the sort of the outlier time period? Were we always headed to a near zero / low rate paradigm?

t3_fq680z,Interest rates and their effect on equity valuations,"tl;dr at the bottom. I also tried to break the post up into logical sections. 

So this is sort of a follow up to the question I posed yesterday asking kind of the 'how and why' we got to this point of ultra low interest rate environment: [Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/fpjbcs/what_has_caused_the_fed_fund_rate_to_decline_over)

I feel like we got some very good discussion, and I think one of the obvious conclusions was that lending money (especially to the government) has just gotten a whole heck of a lot less risky over time. 

I also asked why inflation has stayed tempered through all this, and got some good answers as well. 

This leads me to the next step in my thought process...

**Question Posed:**

Now that we *maybe* know the 'how and why',  I think the next obvious question is where are we headed in the future (regarding interest rates) and what will the effect be on asset pricing. 

**So here's the thought experiment that I came up with**

The federal funds rate peaked in the early 1980's, the 10 year treasury yield was around 15.8% (June 1981). Today, the 10 year treasury sits at 0.70%. How much has equity growth been attributed to the falling risk free rate (10 year treasury used here) in that time?

In discounted cash flow analysis, pricing of an equity (company, market, whatever) is driven by the following:

Initial Cash Flow, Future Growth (both short term and long term), and Discount rate (Risk Free Rate + Risk premium)

The goal is to try to quantify how much of market returns have been driven by the fall in the risk free rate (from June 1981 to today)

As such we'll dumb down the the DCF analysis by using constants for all other input variable. 

-------------------------

DCF - 1981

Input:

FCF = $100 (dummy value)

growth (g) = 2% (reasonable terminal value rate)

Risk Free Rate (rfr) = 15.8% (10 year in 1981)

Risk Premium (rp) = 5.0% (dummy value)

Discount Rate (dr) = 15.8% + 5.0% = 20.8%

Terminal value calculation (for Intrinsic Value):

TV = FCF × (1 + g) / (dr - g)

TV81 = $542

-------------------------

DCF - Present

Using the same FCF, growth rate, and risk premium rates from above. 

Risk Free Rate (rfr) = 0.7% (10 year current)

Discount Rate (dr) = 0.72% + 5.0% = 5.72%

Terminal value calculation (for Intrinsic Value):

TV = FCF × (1 + g) / (dr - g)

TV20 = $13866

Annualized growth:

(TV20  / TV81)^(1/39) - 1 = 4.26% growth

**Findings**

The change in interest rate accounted for 4.26% annualized growth in the stock market. The total real returns between June 1981 to now (February 2020) are 8.4%. 

This accounts for almost half of the annualized growth in asset pricing in the past 40 years. 

Obviously this analysis is incomplete (and most likely wrong in some aspects), but I think it gets the point across that falling rates have had at least some (and most likely significant) affect on equity growth.

**What does this mean going forward**

So we've deduced that lowering interest rates is likely a primary driver for market returns. 

The next logical question is where would interest rates need to be in the future to replicate the same returns over the next 39 years? 

Using the same parameters in the above calculations (with only the risk free rate as the dependant variable), we get a 10 year treasury yield of -2.3% in 2059. 

So, can the world sustain an environment where you lend the government 100 dollars and they give you 98 back? I have no clue. 

What happens in an inflationary period where rates need to be adjusted upwards? Likely the inverse correlation will be observed. 

I think at the very least, we need to be prepared for decreased market returns going into the future, which could have major impacts to the newish trend of young retirees. 

**Disclaimer**

Obviously this was an initial look into an idea that's been kicking around in my head for a couple days. I realize that I used (practically) the two most extreme points in modern history. The point of the post wasn't too fear monger or anything like that. The findings section likely shows the max possible (or even exaggerated) influence that lowering rates have on the market. I do think, however, there is a non insignificant boost that can be attributed to equity returns. A further look at multiple time periods would need to be done to draw any real conclusions (especially comparing similar points in various business cycles - it does us no good to compare times of prosperity to times of distress).

**Further Discussion**

If you think the starting assumptions are so bad that it renders the entire post moot, I'd love to hear it. However, I realize that the total impact could skew in either direction (maybe by a decent amount), and I'd like to use this time to discuss the big picture and not get too lost in the weeds (yet).

**TL;DR**

Falling interest rates over time have likely attributed to a significant boost in equity returns. What does that mean for future returns now that we are in a near zero rate environment?",6,0.68,1585344526.0

t3_fqknq0,Long Thesis - Whirlpool (WHR),"Hey again everyone! I wanted to share my thoughts on another company I made a move on recently - [Whirlpool (WHR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WHR/). In the post below, I want to point anyone who wants to know what impact COVID has on my analysis to my [post on Weyerhaeuser (WY)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/fnl2zl/my_view_on_weyerhaeuser_wy/), since I chat about it in detail there.

**DISCLAIMER: I have a long position in $WHR & the stuff below is just my opinion, not actual investing or financial advice.**

Whirlpool is **the** home appliance company. It owns brand names that most folks would be familiar with - besides their namesake - like Maytag & KitchenAid.

Competition is fierce in the home appliance industry. Names like LG, Samsung, Electrolux, Haier, and Bosch are all key players. Cost is king in terms of determining profitability (just read through the Whirlpool 10-K to get a feel). As you can imagine - economies of scale are vital to achieving that cost advantage.

Whirlpool competes across three main market segments in home appliances:

* Laundry (30% of revenue)
* Refrigerators & freezers (31%)
* Cooking appliances (23%)

They are definitely the market leader in laundry with [\~45% market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/712023/united-states-statista-survey-washing-machine-brands-us-consumers-have-at-home/) and a close leader in refrigerators & freezers with \~[22% market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/711820/united-states-statista-survey-refrigerator-brands-us-consumers-have-at-home/). Combined with strong approx. FCFs of $600M annually - it's no wonder I got interested when it was trading around $4B in market cap a week and a half ago (currently \~$5.2B).

Now it's not all rosy - digging into their financials reveals a more gritty picture. Notably - two consecutive years of revenue decline and $4.1B in LT debt.

That leads me to the three major risks I see facing Whirlpool (WHR) going forward:

1. Company is on the decline
2. Company can't shift to e-commerce
3. Company defaults on debt

In terms of company decline, I see this as unlikely. The simplistic way to think about this: have people stopped doing laundry, using refrigerators, cooking? No. In fact, I see no structural shift in the market to cause the entire company to spiral over the next few years.

Are there any structural problems with the company itself? Well, digging into their geographic segment data - you can see that the revenue declines have come only in international markets. Whirlpool's core North American market is growing. If there was something structurally wrong about the company, I'd expect to see declines across the board and that doesn't seem to be the case here. For now.

What's happening in the international segments? I'm not fully sure yet. It could be increased competition from Bosch, Haier, etc. or something related to exchange rates and where production is happening for the different firms. I'm doing more analysis on this in the background, but haven't reached any insightful conclusions yet.

In terms of Whirlpool's (WHR) ability to shift to e-commerce...well this one does have me worried. I have no real insight into the company's culture, management, or otherwise that would lead me to believe they'd be bad or good at making this shift. But I will say that switching from a brick & mortar / distributor GTM to an e-commerce GTM is not trivial.

However, what does give me solace is that this factor is dependent on how quickly the population moves to e-commerce for major home appliances. I believe this will track slower and in line with population aging / turnover over the coming decade(s) as opposed to the next year or two.

Finally, there's the worry that Whirlpool (WHR) defaults on their large debt load in the short-run - making all of this long-run nonsense meaningless. On this point, I believe two factors will help Whirlpool (WHR) survive the short-term COVID shock:

1. $2B in cash on the balance sheet
2. [Fed financing investment grade debt](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/03/25/stimulus-bill-gives-fed-direct-loan-funds-with-few-strings/)

Whirlpool (WHR) is rocking a [Baa1 credit rating](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Whirlpool-Corporation-credit-rating-825000) right now and should be able to tap into Fed funds to refinance. Worst case, they also have $2B in cash that they can tap into to keep the wheels turning while the general economic environment recovers.

So yes - there are significant risks associated with Whirlpool (WHR). But my thesis on the macro and firm levels lead me to believe the upside is still attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.

**EDIT**: removed some verbiage that called things 'no-brainer' or 'significant upside' - I'm going to stick to wording that is a bit more neutral going forward.

t3_fr04rj,Let's Talk About Simon Property Group (SPG),"SPG is one of the largest REITs in the world and owns roughly 200 malls, many of which are considered high-quality.  Most, but not all, of these commercial properties are based in the US.  SPG make money by renting out space in the malls.  While some may say retail is dead, SPG has done fairly well, increasing revenue by over 25% and nearly doubling profitability over the past 10 years.  SPG is not in a dying industry and likely will continue to generate cash into the far future, assuming they can avoid bankruptcy in the near future.

On 10 Feb SPG announced they would acquire an 80% stake in another REIT owning high-quality malls, Taubman Centers (TCO).  This will cost them approximately $3.6 billion in cash, leaving $2.4 bn available under their credit facilities.

On 18 March SPG closed all of their malls to slow the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus).  As of 31 Dec 19 SPG had $6.0 billion available under its credit facilities.

In the past year, SPG had 5.8 bn in revenues and 2.9 bn in FCF.  Assuming a similar level of expenditure while closed, it costs them  about 2.9 bn/year or $220 mil per month to remain closed with 0 revenue.  SPG will probably allow tenants to defer rent or waive rent entirely in order to avoid ugly evictions.  Keeping tenants, even tenants paying 0 rent, is desirable to SPG in order to maintain the network effect that draws customers into their malls.

In the very worst case scenario, where SPG keeps all malls closed, reimburses their tenants all rent, consummates the deal with TCO at the full price of $3.6 bn, and is unable to secure any new credit, they will still be able to remain solvent for almost 11 months.

The current price of SPG is 58.17, with a market cap of $18 bn.  The average of the last 10 years' FCF is around 21 bn, meaning SPG is trading around 9x its average FCF and around 7x last years' FCF.  

SPG was trading around 20x FCF prior to the recent pandemic.  Currently shares can be had for a 2/3 discount.

t3_froc8z,KONE $KNEBV High ROIC E&E business with huge exposure to China.,"KONE, a Finnish E&E (Elevator and Escalator) business that has huge exposure to China. Largest market share in China in New Equipment Market. And 4th largest globally. KONE is a great business with a tremendous record of ROIC (Including goodwill) with the 15 yr avg at 31%. Return on Tangible Capital as you expect is higher with a 15 yr avg of 90% which is bonkers. This is helped by the fact that the business always has negative net working capital as customers prepay with advance and progress payments and being Asset and Capital light with minimal CapEx with the 15 yr avg being 1.1% of Sales.


Obviously this is the long term view and COVID19 will significantly impact new equipment orders and ''modernization'' aftermarket business in the next 12 months, I believe their New Equipment Orders and modernization will take a massive hit in the double digits but recurring revenue in maintenance will be stable. KONE is under leveraged at 0.4x EBITDA and is capital light. However, they have an OpEx of 3.7B EUR with 3B in wages and salaries, their Variable Cost % of sales is 48%, we will see their EBITDA margin fall down to 11% from 15% last year and EBIT margin from 12 to 10%. They currently have a cash balance of 2.25B, a revolver of 1B which they haven't drawn and uncommitted commercial paper of 500M. With how underleveraged they are, I believe they'll be able to secure debt albeit at a higher cost.


New equipment orders in China won’t be like last two decades and will probably grow 2% each year but as it becomes a more mature market, sales mix will shift to recurring revenue in maintenance and aftermarket. Keep in mind, even if China’s New Equipment TAM doesn’t grow, It is still significantly larger than Non-China TAM. China’s New Equipment market is 600k units per year. The rest of the world is 300k.


KONE’s sales mix in mature markets is 1/3 New equipment and 2/3 service. In China, it’s 85% New Equipment and 15% service. There’s potential upside here for service revenue. Service is maintenance + “modernization”.


Another important metric is conversion of new equipment orders into maintenance contracts. New equipment usually comes with 2 years of maintenance and after that, the customer can choose to enter into a new longer contract. KONE also services non-KONE E&E in its installed base. KONE's conversion ratio for mature markets is 80%. For China, it’s around 50%. Again, potential upside. With increased conversion ratio, installed base could potentially grow 6% each year.


There's also opportunity for growth in the aftermarket “modernization” business of upgrades and replacements. By 2025, 30% of KONE's Installed base will be > 10 yrs old. Currently, that number sits below 10%. Modernization revenue grew by double digits last year and will probably continue to do so in the next decade (Edit: Obviously 2020 will not grow as mentioned earlier). Right now Modernization is only 15% of total revenue.


KONE's opportunity to shift the sales mix and increase the maintenance contract conversion ratio is helped by the consolidation of Property developers in China, where top 100 developers market share has increased significantly over the past 5 years due to increased regulation and costs. From 22% in 2014 to 55% in 2019. Top 10 market share has also increased in that time period and KONE has relationships with 9 of the top 10.


China’s maintenance service market is highly fragmented (top 4 E&E OEM only holds <30% of market) due to the large number of small independent maintenance providers that small building managers and owners choose to save costs. Large developers demand higher level of service and top OEMs will be able to gain significant market share in the next decade as property developers consolidate even more.


Another important market to consider is India; representing 7% of Global New Equipment market at ~60k units per year. It is expected to grow in HSD in the next decade. KONE has the 2nd largest market share there behind Schindler and is in a prime position to capture the growth opportunities. India's growing urbanization rate is a prime driver of this but New Equipment growth will not be similar to China in the last two decades in the high double digits due to a lower urbanization rate.


At the current price of 50 EUR, KONE's EV is trading at 14x 2019 EBITDA and at the Jan high of 60 EUR (Went down before US end of Feb high due to large exposure to China), it was trading at 16x NTM EBITDA. Among the Top 4, ThyssenKrupp has sold their elevator business. Schindler, KONE and UTX which owns Otis are public. UTX is obviously heavily diversified and trades at 12x EBITDA and Schindler at 14x. Hitachi and Mitsubishi are also large players in China having larger market share than Schindler but lack global presence compared to the top 4. I believe 14x EBITDA for KONE is a fair valuation and KONE has traded at a lower multiple than Schindler in the last 5 years and could potentially trade higher once they shift more towards recurring revenue in maintenance (40% of Schindler's revenue comes from maintenance compared to 30% for KONE). Plus, the high exposure to China (Largest Market Share) and having the 2nd largest share in India would put KONE in the position to have the highest growth opportunities compared to the Top 4.


With similar margins to last 5 years starting from 2021 at an EBIT margin of 14% (Which I think is a conservative assumption as mgt has outlined that they aim for an EBIT margin of 16% in the next decade through improvements in margins on their KONE care and KONE 24/7 services as they scale and more ''connected/connectivity'' E&E penetration in their installed base) and 2020 will have lower margins due to covid19 impact as stated earlier. 14x 2028F EBITDA and Cashflows discounted at 7% gives me a TP of 65 EUR, which is a 29% upside. With the targeted 16% EBIT margin, the TP is 71 EUR, 42% upside.

Please poke holes into my thesis, I'm still a beginner at this, thank you :)

t3_fsgg5z,LSE:BSD small cap illiquid stock asset play,"So BSD itself I have almost no interest in, it seems to loan money to other companies and doesn't seem like a good company. They also have an extremely shady past with a Ukranian oligarch who used to own majority shares having money laundered and stolen money from the company.

New management has been installed since however that has zwi williger and joseph williger (brothers) who have taken a majority share and have been purchasing huge amounts of the stock recently.

So this former problem should no longer be an issue.

These brothers both started another company called Willi food (NASDAQ:WILC) which is a supplier of kosher foods, vegetables, milk etc in israel.

The reason why LSE:BSD is a good value buy imo is because it owns the majority of WILC shares and WILC trades at a significant premium compared to LSE:BSD on the market which means their is a very good chance LSE:BSD is undervalued.

Numbers converted to GBP as of 21/03/2020:

BSD owns 5,800,000 WILC shares.

BSD has 129,000,000 shares outstanding.

WILC trades for £8.58 per share

BSD trades for £0.22 per share

Total worth of BSD owned WILC shares: £50m

Worth of BSD owned WILC shares each: £0.38

What the above calculations mean is that for every BSD share you buy for £0.22 you are essentially getting the economic value of a WILC share which is worth £0.38. The shares in WILC that BSD holds is worth almost 2x the value of the entire market cap of BSD.

Even if you think BSD's own cash flow and net income are terrible and worth a negative, their is no way it should be this cheap.

Not only that but the market cap of BSD is slightly higher than the enterprise value and WILC market cap is almost 2x it's own enterprise value, which means it's essentially even cheaper than the above calculation.

Also the liquidation value of BSD worst case scenario using benjamin graham's NNWC is currently this:

BSD NNWC = £26m cash + £9.24 AR + £2.77 Inv - £7.71 liab = £30m

BSD Net-Net Working Capital Per share = £0.23

Which means that if the company went bankrupt today and liquidated it's assets you would get £0.23 for every share. Usually when companies are trading at 1-1 NNWC they have serious issues but not BSD.

The best way to own a great company like WILC isn't to buy it. It's to buy BSD.

Currently the company ran into not having enough shares in the hands of the EU public to be listed on the LSE (25%), so whether they buy the remaining shares at a premium and take it private or delist it I have no idea. But I don't really care either way as this is a long hold for me.

I am long BSD.",4,0.7,1585673489.0
t3_ftu76f,General Dynamics (NYSE: $GD) - Investment Thesis,"Disclaimer: This report is for informational purposes only. I do not hold any positions in $GD

**Company Overview**

General Dynamics (NYSE: $GD) is a global Aerospace & Defense company that provides products and services in business aviation, combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; information technology  (IT)  services; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions; and shipbuilding and ship repair. This business consists of 5 operating segments:

* *Aerospace*: Under Gulfstream, this segment produces mid to large cabin luxury business jets for commercial and government clients around the world.
* *Combat Systems*: CS produces and offers combat vehicles, weapon systems, and munitions to the U.S Government and its international allies. Product offerings include wheeled combat and tactical vehicles, battle tanks and tracked combat vehicles.
* *Information Technology*: This segment provides IT services, IT infrastructure modernization, and professional services to various U.S Government entities and other classified global customers. 
* *Mission Systems*: Mission Systems offers intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities which include ground systems, intelligence and cyber systems, and naval/air/electronic warfare systems to the U.S Defense community. 
* *Marine Systems*: MS produces nuclear-powered submarines, surface combatants, and auxiliary and combat-logistics ships for the U.S Navy and allies.

**Valuation**

*Assumptions*:

With a risk free rate of 0.58% (10Y T bond), calculated cost of equity at 12.56% (high equity risk), and cost of debt at 1.24% (low interest rates), the weighted average cost of capital is 7.80%, slightly higher than the industry average. Over time, I assumed that this would converge to the industry average of 7%

With revenue growth, I assumed a 4% drop for the next year due to potentially reduced business jet demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the first year, GD would recover and grow at the current 8% revenue growth rate, until it reached 2% (expected risk free rate) growth in perpetuity. Similarly, with operating margins, next year's operating margins might be affected by the pandemic and hence I assumed 9% for the same. When GD recovers, it's operating margins are going to be in line with industry averages and its past performance at 12%.

Currently, GD is enjoying a 17.5% effective tax rate, however, I assume that these advantages will fade over time and the tax rate will converge to the marginal tax rate.

As the company grows, I also assumed that ROC will grow from 10% to 12%. However, this is not competitive with the industry average of 33.93%.

*Cash Flows*: The figure shows the cash flows of revenue and operating income under these assumptions.

*Value*: Discounting the above cash flows to the cost of capital gives us the firm value of $71,606 million. Removing debt and adding back cash yields the value of equity and results in an intrinsic value of $158.24 per share.

**Risks**

**General Dynamics relies on the U.S Government for a significant portion of their revenue**: Sales to the U.S Government accounted for 65% of the consolidated revenue for FY2019, and decreases in U.S. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in programs being delayed or terminated, which could impact performance.

**The Aerospace segment is subject to changes in customer demand for business jets**: Unlike defense products, business jet demand is subject to market conditions, which could impact performance.

**Conclusion**

General Dynamics is a highly diversified company in terms of product/service range and is an essential part of the U.S Defense industrial base that supports the DoD and its allies. With the current valuation and $GD trading at $127.40, I recommend $GD as a buy with a price target of **$158.24**.

For those that haven't read it; The dude employs over 1000 full and part time employees to go to over 600 stores and surveil them for 900+ full store-days (not 900 days consecutively, approx 1.5 days per store I forget exact numbers). Not to mention figuring out they were over reporting their ad spend by tracking the exact company that was used and putting together the pieces of what seems would be quite a significant campaign. Then, what I find to be most impressive, is they somehow gathered 25K+ receipts from customers and figured out they were exaggerating how much each customer spent and in reality they were offering larger discounts. There was much more, but for the sake of brevity that's all I'll address. All of this was used to infer that they were cooking the books and vastly overstating their revenue numbers in financial reports in order to appease investors (as well as garner new investments), inflate stock prices and eventually use their stock pledges to leave investors hold the bag.

**Introduction**

Implenia is a swiss construction and construction services company that operates in four segments: buildings, civil engineering, specialties and development. Division buildings focuses on the integrated conception and construction of complex new buildings, as well as the modernization of existing properties. The division is the second biggest by revenue and EBITDA (CHF 2,242 million and CHF 51.5 million). Civil engineering encompasses tunnel construction, special foundations and Implenia’s regional business, which includes road and railway construction. Division civil engineering is positioned to profit from the mobility and infrastructure investment megatrends. Civil engineering is the biggest division by revenue and EBITDA (CHF 2,300 million and CHF 77.2 million). Division specialties brings together Implenia’s niche services, including timber construction, formwork, facade and prestressing technology, energy management and construction logistics. The range of activities also includes integrated gravel, concrete and bitumen plants, interior construction, and an innovation hub that acts as an accelerator for new services. This division is the third largest by revenue and the smallest by EBITDA (CHF 242 million and CHF 19.2 million). The development division specializes in value-oriented development of properties and sites. Land is acquired in Switzerland’s premium locations and properties are developed into residential real estate, offices and hotels. Currently this division operates mainly in Switzerland, but the goal is to expand beyond the home market. This is the smallest division by revenues and the third largest by EBITDA (CHF 133 million and CHF 44.5 million). It also operates with the least amount of employees out of all the divisions by a wide margin (76 employees in development out of 10,168 employees total). The focus of the investment thesis will be on the value inherent to the real estate portfolio of this division.

The company experienced major operational challenges in its international business in 2018, resulting in a big hit to profitability (reducing EBITDA from CHF 174 million in 2017 to CHF 89.7 million in 2018), due to value adjustments of CHF 70 to CHF 90 million as a result of one-time write-downs. Consequently, the dividend was cut from CHF 2.00 per share in 2018 to CHF 0.50 per share in 2019. Although the company claimed that the issues were isolated to certain international projects and the loss of profitability was a one-time effect, the stock price declined more than 66%, from CHF 80 per share in mid 2018 to CHF 26 per share in mid 2019. After showing a stabilization of earnings in the first half of 2019 and confirming EBITDA guidance of CHF 150 million, the stock price rebounded to around CHF 40 per share. It stayed around there for a while before going to CHF 50 per share in February 2020 after presenting full year results and plans to spin-off the real estate portfolio associated with the development division. The stock price has recently fallen with the rest of equity markets to CHF 34 as of April 3. With concrete plans for the spin-off of the real estate portfolio in place, the risk/reward appears to be even better than it was in mid 2019.

**Spin-off of Real Estate Portfolio**

The real estate assets are currently valued at historic acquisition costs of CHF 189 million on the balance sheet. According to an independent real estate consulting and valuation firm, Wüest Partner AG, the actual current market value is more than CHF 600 million. In June of this year Implenia intends to spin-off 50% of the real estate assets at a market value of approx. CHF 300 million into the newly founded Ina Invest AG. Shareholders have voted and approved a special distribution by way of dividend in kind at the recent General Annual Meeting on March 24. Implenia shareholders will receive one share of Ina Invest AG for every five shares of Implenia.

&#x200B;

After the spin-off, Ina Invest will hold a portfolio of high-quality real estate assets in prime locations across Zurich/Winterthur, Basel, and Lake Geneva. The transferred development projects are mostly residential real estate (54%), Offices (31%) and Hotels (9%).

&#x200B;

[Source: Information brochure for Implenia shareholders](https://preview.redd.it/c5qs0xe5t8r41.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6581eb3ec77347a5cffaae3a8b762259f82691c)

The transaction is supposed to crystalize the true value of the real estate portfolio and create immediate revaluation gains for Implenia shareholders of over CHF 200 million (CHF 94.5 million real estate book value compared to estimated market value of CHF 300 million) with potential future revaluation gains for the retained assets that will likely be transferred at a later point as well. Concurrently to the spin-off Ina Invest will raise new equity of approx. CHF 100 million. Implenia shareholders will receive non-tradeable subscription rights to acquire the new shares of Ina Invest. Swiss Life Group, the biggest life insurer in Switzerland, intends to acquire a significant stake of up to 15% in the new company. Here’s the timeline of events as it currently stands:

&#x200B;

[Source: Information brochure for Implenia shareholders](https://preview.redd.it/ri95wzrat8r41.png?width=2368&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa958c3cb6200f541c38a4413d269529ceb7fb5)

At the current share price of CHF 33.50, as of market close on April 3, the company is valued at CHF 618 million. I don’t include the net cash position of over CHF 200 million in my enterprise value calculation, because I assume that the cash is tied up in operations due to the working capital dynamics in the construction business. I also disregard potential dilution from the subordinated convertible bond due for repayment in June 2022. The bond is convertible into 2.3 million shares at a price of CHF 76.05. Not a single conversion has been exercised since the issuance of the bond in June 2015. After adding minority interest of CHF 28 million, the enterprise value is CHF 646 million. If the real estate assets are in fact worth over CHF 600 million, you’re getting the core business for CHF 46 million, a fraction of EBITDA.

Obviously, the basic thesis is predicated on the real estate assets being actually worth CHF 600 million or more than 3x book value. How do we know that’s right? One way to find out is to look at the actual real estate sales closed by the company in the past. I’ve gone back and looked at all the real estate transactions disclosed in the annual reports since 2014.

&#x200B;

[Source: Author’s calculation](https://preview.redd.it/szvtkplft8r41.png?width=2416&format=png&auto=webp&s=5709e56afdbc84347e8f4b358d27fd046b93cf51)

On average sales have been closed at a 100% premium to the carrying amount on the books. Applying the premium from historic transactions to the current assets, values today’s real estate portfolio at about CHF 378 million. However, since the current real estate portfolio is comprised of only the highest quality assets in terms of property and location, it’s not unreasonable to assume a higher market value compared to past sales. It’s likely the portfolio was purposely distilled down to the best assets by selling of the lower quality properties and retaining the best ones. Nonetheless, in order to be conservative, I will assume different premiums to book value in my valuation.

But first let’s look at the value of Implenia’s core operations after the spin-off is completed. Full year 2019 EBITDA was CHF 186.77 million, plus one-time cost associated with the issues in 2018 of CHF 20 million, less half of the EBITDA contributed by the development division that will be spun-off, equals a post spin normalized EBITDA of CHF 184.52 million. Historically the company has traded at 6.11 times EV/EBITDA going back to 2009, some European comps are trading at 8 times EV/EBITDA. Putting a 5 to 7 times multiple on the normalized EBITDA and subtracting minority interests and the transferred book value of the real estate assets, translates to an equity value per Implenia share of CHF 43.33 to CHF 63.31 for the core business.

[Source: Author’s calculation](https://preview.redd.it/exu0y6ukt8r41.png?width=1592&format=png&auto=webp&s=f465dc351db62d724d78bed8dbf0a5f5ff238961)

As for the real estate value, I assume different premiums to book value in my valuation: i) 3.17 (Wüest Partner AG), ii) 2.00 (based on historic transactions) and iii) 1.00 (assigning no premium to book value at all). Further, I consider a revaluation of transferred as well as retained assets. Applying the different premiums, I arrive at an equity value per Implenia share for the transferred assets of CHF 5.12 to CHF 16.24 and a potential revaluation gain for the retained assets of CHF 5.12 to CHF 11.18.

[Source: Author’s calculation](https://preview.redd.it/1mbhbj9qt8r41.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3166dfec624bd01154a641656f0105a5d2fee0)

The sum of the parts analysis shows a band of plausible valuations, ranging from CHF 48.45 to CHF 90.68 per share, depending on your combination of assumptions about the EV/EBITDA multiple for the core business, the premium for the real estate assets and whether you apply a premium to the retained assets as well. Even with the most conservative assumptions (that can still be considered plausible) you end up with significant upside from the current share price. The mean target is CHF 69.27, implying more than 100% upside from the current share price.

[Source: Author’s calculation](https://preview.redd.it/983hjogvt8r41.png?width=1804&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ea7f88a9d8d19a44b8735123c496c368b6bfb4c)

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the current setup looks like a promising risk/reward opportunity with potential upside of more than 100% and limited downside due to the hard asset value of the real estate portfolio. Additional upside may come from EBITDA margin expansion (currently 4.22% compared to mid-term guidance of 6.25% to 6.75%) and the increased capacity for cheap financial leverage in the new entity. Due to the its low equity ratio and the working capital dynamics in the construction business, Implenia has been constraint in the amount of debt it could employ. Ina Invest will be able to take better advantage of the zero-interest rate environment to accelerate the acquisition and development of new projects. In its core business, Implenia is well positioned to profit from megatrends in urbanization, mobility, and infrastructure development. But all of that is additional optionality. For the investment thesis to work out you only need to believe a very conservative set of assumptions.  

As of today, a lot of details about the rights offering aren’t available yet. I especially hope to get more information about insider participation. According to Implenia’s head of investor relations, an official prospectus will be published about the spin-off and the rights offering by Credit Suisse (underwriter) in the next weeks. Once it’s available I will do a follow up post.

t3_fwkpwm,"Nova LifeStyle, Inc. 2018 10-k (NVFY)","Currently sifting through small companies for value opportunities and came across company Nova LifeStyle inc. They have delayed release of their 2019 filling so I decided to look at their 2018 10-k. I think this company is a perfect example of what to watch out for as, in my opinion, it looks very distressed and may go bankrupt. 

At first look they are posting consistent revenues and positive earnings. Current assets to current liabilities ratio is really large, also insignificant amount of debt. All good, I thought. 

Then taking a look at their cash flow statements I noticed that in the past ten years, the company's operations only generated cash 3 of those 10 years (last time positive was 2013). They also roll over debt each year (increasing)  and it looks like they pay it before closing the books for the year so it doesn't appear on the balance sheet. I thought this was strange and decided to look into it. I found that their A/R was greatly increasing and last 10k they posted an AR that was on a trajectory to be greater than their revenues (Revenues $88M, AR $67M). This was a huge red flag to me as they are either not able to collect on their customers, are fabricating sales and running them through AR, or a combination of the two. Their 10k states (pg22) that they have had issues collecting from customers and state that $40M of 67M is over 180 days past due but they only list their allowance as 224k.

I thought that if this company was doing this poorly in a boom economy I would venture a guess that they probably will not be around long in a recession economy. 

Anyways, wanted to share that even though you may have certain ratios that you look for in a company, always go deeper. Read the 10-k! The notes to the financial statements is a required and necessary component of the complete set of financial statements. I have had my mind changed on companies that may have had great financials but their strategy or decisions about things I disagreed with and decided not to invest.",14,0.84,1586266975.0
t3_fwej0t,Tanker Stocks Overview,"I have been attracted to tanker stocks recently following recent events in the oil market. The basic thesis:

1. The combination of the Saudi / Russia oil price war and the coronavirus outbreak demand shock is leading to significant [excess supply in the market](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/oil-prices-could-plunge-below-20-a-barrel-in-q2-as-demand-craters-cnbc-survey.html). This should generally benefit tanker demand as all these excess barrels of oil need to be moved and stored
2. Although having narrowed significantly during the last week, the oil market still is in [contango](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude.html) which combined with recent price volatility should also support tanker demand. [Some VLCCs have been chartered for long term storage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-shipping/oil-tanker-rates-double-as-demand-for-storage-and-transport-resurfaces-idUSKBN21H15Q).
3. The fundamentals of the tanker market (e.g. [supply of new ships](https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/tankers/tanker-market-surge-time-its-real-frontline-ceo)) have already turned positive before the recent market turmoil

These combined factors have led to [exploding charter rates](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/as-oil-prices-plummet-crude-oil-tanker-time-charter-rates-skyrocket/) which should lead to nice Q1 and Q2 earnings. However, I recognize that tanker stocks are generally a bad long term investment (just look at the share price chart of any tanker stock) and this will be a short term investment: Let’s say sell after Q2 results.

&#x200B;

[As of Apr 4, 2020](https://preview.redd.it/wk8q0vozvbr41.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f3505d288fcefd743c1ea446954a329667f64e1)

After doing some basic analysis on financials and valuation you can see that nearly all trade below book value and have significant debt (2.5x – 8x EBITDA). Generally, I would have preferred to invest in an ETF here since I think it is hard to make a good call on management and capital structure but I couldn’t find an ETF so let’s have a quick look at individual names:

I have grouped tankers into 3 categories (big crude, mixed and product) based on the size of tankers (e.g. VLCC, Suezmax, Product Tankers). However, my understanding is that rates for various types tend to generally move together while fluctuating on a day-to-day basis.

**Frontline** (mixed): The chairman and 40% owner of Frontline [John Fredriksen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fredriksen) is a billionaire so clearly they know what they are doing. However, valuation is rather high (price / book) and based on a short review of the annual report there are some significant related party transactions with other entities owned by the Fredriksen. I decided to pass here

**Euronav** (big crude / mixed): Looked most solid given size and relatively low leverage. Governance looks good with dividend policy in place. Slight premium seems reasonable.

**International Seaways** (mixed): Valuation seems attractive compared to other mixed players. Looks overlevered based on interest coverage – however, they recently announced refinancing reducing interest expenses by 25%. Went long – boom or bust this is a short term trade

**DHT** (big crude): VLCC pure play likely benefiting from storage demand for large crude tankers. Governance ok and some premium warranted. Also announced some [nice long-term charters](https://www.dhtankers.com/dht-holdings-inc-announces-time-charters-for-six-of-its-vlccs/)

**Teekay** (mixed): Decided to pass despite low valuation and nice [youtube market updates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90BIjOkEP0Y). I didn’t like the additional complexity through the Teekay structure and related transactions

**DSSI** (mixed / product): Looks overlevered but trading at significant discount to book. Governance looks ok.

**Scorpio** (product): Invested here, but clearly overlevered and I actually do not like the governance structure (insider majority in board, related party dealings). However, the chairman [bought call options](https://www.scorpiotankers.com/scorpio-tankers-inc-announces-purchase-of-call-options-by-president-of-the-company-4/).

**NAT** (mixed): Looks relatively expensive with no VLCC exposure. Governance ok

Although I have looked at tankers before, I am definitely no expert in this sector. However, the basic thesis seems reasonable and I will keep following this for a few quarters. Risks:

1. Crude prices recover quickly / contango disappears: Definitely possible although unlikely given the demand situation. Supply is also driven by geopolitics making things volatile
2. Permanent reduction in supply, e.g. peak oil: This is a key concern over the long run and a key reason why I don’t like this as a long-term investment
3. Governance: I feel there is inherent mgmt / governance risk with all these names: Mgmt may take advantage of positive market backdrop to hurt shareholder value by engaging in M&A / new vessel acquisition instead of returning cash

In light of the recent fall in oil prices due to the Saudi-Russian dispute and dampening demand for oil due to the lockdowns implemented globally, O&G stocks have taken a severe beating, falling approximately 50% from their highs at the beginning of the year. Not spared from this onslaught is Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (Hibiscus), a listed oil and gas (O&G) exploration and production (E&P) company.

Why invest in O&G stocks in this particularly uncertain period? For one, valuations of these stocks have fallen to multi-year lows, bringing the potential ROI on these stocks to attractive levels. Oil prices are cyclical, and are bound to return to the mean given a sufficiently long time horizon. The trick is to find those companies who can survive through this downturn and emerge into “normal” profitability once oil prices rebound.

In this article, I will explore the upsides and downsides of investing in Hibiscus. I will do my best to cater this report to newcomers to the O&G industry – rather than address exclusively experts and veterans of the O&G sector. As an equity analyst, I aim to provide a view on the company primarily, and will generally refrain from providing macro views on oil or opinions about secular trends of the sector. I hope you enjoy reading it!

## Company Snapshot

Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (5199.KL) is an oil and gas (O&G) upstream exploration and production (E&P) company located in Malaysia. As an E&P company, their business can be basically described as:

· looking for oil,

· drawing it out of the ground, and

· selling it on global oil markets.

This means Hibiscus’s profits are particularly exposed to fluctuating oil prices. With oil prices falling to sub-$30 from about $60 at the beginning of the year, Hibiscus’s stock price has also fallen by about 50% YTD – from around RM 1.00 to RM 0.45 (as of 5 April 2020).

https://preview.redd.it/3dqc4jraabr41.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ba0e8614c4e9d781edfc670016a874b90560684

https://preview.redd.it/lvdkrf0cabr41.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f250a713887b06986932fa475dc59c7c28582e

While the company is domiciled in Malaysia, its two main oil producing fields are located in both Malaysia and the UK. The Malaysian oil field is commonly referred to as the **North Sabah** field, while the UK oil field is commonly referred to as the **Anasuria** oil field. Hibiscus has licenses to other oil fields in different parts of the world, notably the **Marigold/Sunflower** oil fields in the UK and the **VIC cluster** in Australia, but its revenues and profits mainly stem from the former two oil producing fields.

Given that it’s a small player and has only two primary producing oil fields, it’s not surprising that Hibiscus sells its oil to a concentrated pool of customers, with 2 of them representing 80% of its revenues (i.e. Petronas and BP). Fortunately, both these customers are oil supermajors, and are unlikely to default on their obligations despite low oil prices.

At RM 0.45 per share, the market capitalization is RM 714.7m and it has a trailing PE ratio of about 5x. It doesn’t carry any debt, and it hasn’t paid a dividend in its listing history. The MD, Mr. Kenneth Gerard Pereira, owns about 10% of the company’s outstanding shares.

&#x200B;

## Reserves (Total recoverable oil) & Production (bbl/day)

To begin analyzing the company, it’s necessary to understand a little of the industry jargon. We’ll start with Reserves and Production.

In general, there are three types of categories for a company’s recoverable oil volumes – *Reserves, Contingent Resources and Prospective Resources*. *Reserves* are those oil fields which are “commercial”, which is defined as below:

*^(As defined by the SPE PRMS,)* ***^(Reserves)*** *^(are “… quantities of petroleum anticipated to be commercially recoverable by application of development projects to known accumulations from a given date forward under defined conditions.”  Therefore, Reserves must be discovered (by drilling), recoverable (with current technology), remaining in the subsurface (at the effective date of the evaluation) and “commercial” based on the development project proposed.)* 

*^(Note that Reserves are associated with development projects.  To be considered as “commercial”, there must be a firm intention to proceed with the project in a reasonable time frame (typically 5 years), and such intention must be based upon all of the following criteria:)*

      *^(- A reasonable assessment of the future economics of the development project meeting defined investment and operating criteria;)*  
      *^(- A reasonable expectation that there will be a market for all or at least the expected sales quantities of production required to justify development;)*  
      *^(- Evidence that the necessary production and transportation facilities are available or can be made available; and)*  
      *^(- Evidence that legal, contractual, environmental and other social and economic concerns will allow for the actual implementation of the recovery project being evaluated.)*

*Contingent Resources* and *Prospective Resources* are further defined as below:

       *^(-)* ***^(Contingent Resources)****^(: potentially recoverable volumes associated with a development plan that targets discovered volumes but is not (yet) commercial (as defined above); and)*  
      *^(-)* ***^(Prospective Resources)****^(: potentially recoverable volumes associated with a development plan that targets as yet undiscovered volumes.)* 

In the industry lingo, we generally refer to *Reserves* as ‘P’ and *Contingent Resources* as ‘C’. These ‘P’ and ‘C’ resources can be further categorized into 1P/2P/3P resources and 1C/2C/3C resources, each referring to a low/medium/high estimate of the company’s potential recoverable oil volumes:

       *^(- Low/1C/1P estimate: there should be reasonable certainty that volumes actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate;)*  
      *^(- Best/2C/2P estimate: there should be an equal likelihood of the actual volumes of petroleum being larger or smaller than the estimate; and)*  
      *^(- High/3C/3P estimate: there is a low probability that the estimate will be exceeded.)*  

Hence in the E&P industry, it is easy to see why most investors and analysts refer to the 2P estimate as the best estimate for a company’s actual recoverable oil volumes. This is because 2P reserves (‘2P’ referring to ‘Proved and Probable’) are a middle estimate of the recoverable oil volumes legally recognized as “commercial”.

However, there’s nothing stopping you from including 2C resources (riskier) or utilizing 1P resources (conservative) as your estimate for total recoverable oil volumes, depending on your risk appetite. In this instance, the company has provided a snapshot of its 2P and 2C resources in its analyst presentation:

https://preview.redd.it/o8qejdyc8br41.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3ab9be8f83badf0206adc982feda3a558d43e78

Basically, what the company is saying here is that by 2021, it will have classified as 2P reserves at least 23.7 million bbl from its Anasuria field and 20.5 million bbl from its North Sabah field – for total **2P reserves of 44.2 million bbl** (we are ignoring the Australian VIC cluster as it is only estimated to reach first oil by 2022).

Furthermore, the company is stating that they have discovered (but not yet legally classified as “commercial”) a further 71 million bbl of oil from both the Anasuria and North Sabah fields, as well as the Marigold/Sunflower fields. If we include these 2C resources, the total potential recoverable oil volumes could exceed 100 million bbl.

In this report, we shall explore all valuation scenarios giving consideration to both 2P and 2C resources.

https://preview.redd.it/gk54qplf8br41.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=c905b7a6328432218b5b9dfd53cc9ef1390bd604

The company further targets a 2021 production rate of 20,000 bbl (LTM: 8,000 bbl), which includes 5,000 bbl from its Anasuria field (LTM: 2,500 bbl) and 7,000 bbl from its North Sabah field (LTM: 5,300 bbl).

This is a substantial increase in forecasted production from both existing and prospective oil fields. If it materializes, annual production rate could be as high as 7,300 mmbbl, and 2021 revenues (given FY20 USD/bbl of $60) could exceed RM 1.5 billion (FY20: RM 988 million).

However, this targeted forecast is quite a stretch from current production levels. Nevertheless, we shall consider all provided information in estimating a valuation for Hibiscus.

To understand Hibiscus’s oil production capacity and forecast its revenues and profits, we need to have a better appreciation of the performance of its two main cash-generating assets – the North Sabah field and the Anasuria field.

&#x200B;

***North Sabah oil field***

https://preview.redd.it/62nssexj8br41.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd78f86d51165fb9a93015e49496f7f98dad64dd

Hibiscus owns a 50% interest in the North Sabah field together with its partner Petronas, and has production rights over the field up to year 2040. The asset contains 4 oil fields, namely the St Joseph field, South Furious field, SF 30 field and Barton field.

For the sake of brevity, we shall not delve deep into the operational aspects of the fields or the contractual nature of its production sharing contract (PSC). We’ll just focus on the factors which relate to its financial performance. These are:

· Average uptime

· Total oil sold

· Average realized oil price

· Average OPEX per bbl

With regards to average uptime, we can see that the company maintains relative high facility availability, exceeding 90% uptime in all quarters of the LTM with exception of Jul-Sep 2019. The dip in average uptime was due to production enhancement projects and maintenance activities undertaken to improve the production capacity of the St Joseph and SF30 oil fields. 

Hence, we can conclude that management has a good handle on operational performance. It also implies that there is little room for further improvement in production resulting from increased uptime.

As North Sabah is under a production sharing contract (PSC), there is a distinction between *gross oil production* and *net oil production*. The former relates to total oil drawn out of the ground, whereas the latter refers to Hibiscus’s share of oil production after taxes, royalties and expenses are accounted for. In this case, we want to pay attention to *net* oil production, not *gross*.

We can arrive at Hibiscus’s *total oil sold* for the last twelve months (LTM) by adding up the *total oil sold* for each of the last 4 quarters. Summing up the figures yields total oil sold for the LTM of approximately **2,075,305 bbl**.

Then, we can arrive at an *average realized oil price* over the LTM by averaging the *average realized oil price* for the last 4 quarters, giving us an *average realized oil price* over the LTM of **USD 68.57/bbl**. We can do the same for *average OPEX per bbl*, giving us an *average OPEX per bbl* over the LTM of USD **13.23/bbl**.

Thus, we can sum up the above financial performance of the North Sabah field with the following figures:

· Total oil sold: **2,075,305 bbl**

· Average realized oil price: **USD 68.57/bbl**

· Average OPEX per bbl: **USD 13.23/bbl**

&#x200B;

***Anasuria oil field***

https://preview.redd.it/586u4kfo8br41.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=7580fc7f7df7e948754d025745a5cf47d4393c0f

Doing the same exercise as above for the Anasuria field, we arrive at the following financial performance for the Anasuria field:

· Total oil sold: **1,073,304 bbl**

· Average realized oil price: **USD 63.57/bbl**

· Average OPEX per bbl: **USD 23.22/bbl**

As gas production is relatively immaterial, and to be conservative, we shall only consider the crude oil production from the Anasuria field in forecasting revenues.

&#x200B;

## Valuation (Method 1)

Putting the figures from both oil fields together, we get the following data:

https://preview.redd.it/7y6064dq8br41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4120563a011cf61fc6090e1cd5932602599dc2

Given that we have determined LTM EBITDA of **RM 632m**, the next step would be to subtract ITDA (interest, tax, depreciation & amortization) from it to obtain estimated LTM Net Profit. Using FY2020’s ITDA of approximately RM 318m as a guideline, we arrive at an estimated LTM Net Profit of **RM 314m** (FY20: 230m). Given the current market capitalization of RM 714.7m, this implies a trailing LTM PE of 2.3x.

Performing a sensitivity analysis given different oil prices, we arrive at the following net profit table for the company under different oil price scenarios, assuming oil production rate and ITDA remain constant:

https://preview.redd.it/xixge5sr8br41.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=288a00f6e5088d01936f0217ae7798d2cfcf11f2

From the above exercise, it becomes apparent that Hibiscus has a breakeven oil price of about **USD 41.8863/bbl**, and has a lot of **operating leverage** given the exponential rate of increase in its Net Profit with each consequent increase in oil prices.

Considering that the oil production rate (EBITDA) is likely to increase faster than ITDA’s proportion to revenues (fixed costs), at an **implied PE of 4.33x**, it seems likely that an investment in Hibiscus will be profitable over the next 10 years (with the assumption that oil prices will revert to the mean in the long-term).

&#x200B;

## Valuation (Method 2)

Of course, there are a lot of assumptions behind the above method of valuation. Hence, it would be prudent to perform multiple methods of valuation and compare the figures to one another.

As opposed to the profit/loss assessment in Valuation (Method 1), another way of performing a valuation would be to estimate its balance sheet value, i.e. total revenues from 2P Reserves, and assign a reasonable margin to it.

https://preview.redd.it/o2eiss6u8br41.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=03960cce698d9cedb076f3d5f571b3c59d908fa8

From the above, we understand that Hibiscus’s **2P reserves** from the North Sabah and Anasuria fields *alone* are approximately **44.2 mmbbl** (we ignore contribution from Australia’s VIC cluster as it hasn’t been developed yet).

Doing a similar sensitivity analysis of different oil prices as above, we arrive at the following estimated total revenues and accumulated net profit:

https://preview.redd.it/h8hubrmw8br41.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d23f0f9c3dafda89e758b815072ba335467f33e

Let’s assume that the above average of RM 9.68 billion in total realizable revenues from current 2P reserves holds true. If we assign a conservative Net Profit margin of 15% (FY20: 23%; past 5 years average: 16%), we arrive at estimated **accumulated Net Profit from 2P Reserves of** **RM 1.452 billion**. Given the current market capitalization of RM 714 million, we might be able to say that the equity is worth about twice the current share price.

However, it is understandable that some readers might feel that the figures used in the above estimate (e.g. net profit margin of 15%) were randomly plucked from the sky. So how do we reconcile them with figures from the financial statements? Fortunately, there appears to be a way to do just that.

***Intangible Assets***

I refer you to a figure in the financial statements which provides a shortcut to the valuation of 2P Reserves. This is the carrying value of **Intangible Assets** on the Balance Sheet.

As of 2QFY21, that amount was RM 1,468,860,000 (i.e. **RM 1.468 billion**).

https://preview.redd.it/hse8ttb09br41.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=82e48b5961c905fe9273cb6346368de60202ebec

Quite coincidentally, one might observe that this figure is dangerously close to the *estimated accumulated Net Profit from 2P Reserves* of **RM 1.452 billion** we calculated earlier. But why would this amount matter at all?

To answer that, I refer you to the notes of the Annual Report FY20 (AR20). On page 148 of the AR20, we find the following two paragraphs:

*^(E&E assets comprise of rights and concession and conventional studies. Following the acquisition of a concession right to explore a licensed area, the costs incurred such as geological and geophysical surveys, drilling, commercial appraisal costs and other directly attributable costs of exploration and appraisal including technical and administrative costs, are capitalised as conventional studies, presented as intangible assets.)*

*^(E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The Group will allocate E&E assets to cash generating unit (“CGU”)s or groups of CGUs for the purpose of assessing such assets for impairment. Each CGU or group of units to which an E&E asset is allocated will not be larger than an operating segment as disclosed in Note 39 to the financial statements.)*

Hence, we can determine that firstly, the intangible asset value represents capitalized costs of acquisition of the oil fields, including technical exploration costs and costs of acquiring the relevant licenses. Secondly, an impairment review will be carried out when “the carrying amount of an E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount”, with E&E assets being allocated to “cash generating units” (CGU) for the purposes of assessment.

On page 169 of the AR20, we find the following:

*^(Carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets, oil and gas assets and FPSO are reviewed for possible impairment annually including any indicators of impairment. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level CGUs for which there is a separately identifiable cash flow available. These CGUs are based on operating areas, represented by the 2011 North Sabah EOR PSC (“North Sabah”), the Anasuria Cluster, the Marigold and Sunflower fields, the VIC/P57 exploration permit (“VIC/P57”) and the VIC/L31 production license (“VIC/L31”).)*

So apparently, the CGUs that have been assigned refer to the respective oil producing fields, two of which include the North Sabah field and the Anasuria field. In order to perform the impairment review, estimates of future cash flow will be made by management to assess the “recoverable amount” (as described above), subject to assumptions and an appropriate discount rate.

Hence, what we can gather up to now is that management will estimate *future recoverable cash flows* from a CGU (i.e. the North Sabah and Anasuria oil fields), compare that to their *carrying value*, and perform an impairment if their *future recoverable cash flows* are less than their *carrying value*. In other words, if estimated accumulated profits from the North Sabah and Anasuria oil fields are less than their carrying value, an impairment is required.

So where do we find the carrying values for the North Sabah and Anasuria oil fields? Further down on page 184 in the AR20, we see the following:

*^(Included in rights and concession are the carrying amounts of producing field licenses in the Anasuria Cluster amounting to RM668,211,518 (2018: RM687,664,530), producing field licenses in North Sabah amounting to RM471,031,008 (2018: RM414,333,116))*

Hence, we can determine that the carrying values for the North Sabah and Anasuria oil fields are RM 471m and RM 668m respectively. But where do we find the future recoverable cash flows of the fields as estimated by management, and what are the assumptions used in that calculation?

Fortunately, we find just that on page 185:

*^(17 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED))*

*^((a) Anasuria Cluster)*

*^(The Directors have concluded that there is no impairment indicator for Anasuria Cluster during the current financial year. In the previous financial year, due to uncertainties in crude oil prices, the Group has assessed the recoverable amount of the intangible assets, oil and gas assets and FPSO relating to the Anasuria Cluster. The recoverable amount is determined using the FVLCTS model based on discounted cash flows (“DCF”) derived from the expected cash in/outflow pattern over the production lives.)*

*^(The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the Anasuria Cluster were as follows:)*

*^((i) Discount rate of 10%;)*

*^((ii) Future cost inflation factor of 2% per annum;)*

*^((iii) Oil price forecast based on the oil price forward curve from independent parties; and,)*

*^((iv) Oil production profile based on the assessment by independent oil and gas reserve experts.)*

*^(Based on the assessments performed, the Directors concluded that the recoverable amount calculated based on the valuation model is higher than the carrying amount.)*

*^((b) North Sabah)*

*^(The acquisition of the North Sabah assets was completed in the previous financial year. Details of the acquisition are as disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.)*

*^(The Directors have concluded that there is no impairment indicator for North Sabah during the current financial year.)*

Here, we can see that the recoverable amount of the Anasuria field was estimated based on a DCF of expected future cash flows over the production life of the asset. The key assumptions used by management all seem appropriate, including a discount rate of 10% and oil price and oil production estimates based on independent assessment. From there, management concludes that the recoverable amount of the Anasuria field is higher than its carrying amount (i.e. no impairment required). Likewise, for the North Sabah field.

How do we interpret this? Basically, what management is saying is that given a 10% discount rate and independent oil price and oil production estimates, the accumulated profits (i.e. recoverable amount) from both the North Sabah and the Anasuria fields exceed their carrying amounts of RM 471m and RM 668m respectively.

In other words, according to management’s own estimates, the **carrying value of the Intangible Assets of RM 1.468 billion** *approximates the accumulated Net Profit recoverable from 2P reserves*.

To conclude **Valuation (Method 2)**, we arrive at the following:

&#x200B;

|| **Our estimates** | **Management estimates** |
|:-|:-|:-|
| **Accumulated Net Profit from 2P Reserves** | RM 1.452 billion | RM 1.468 billion |

&#x200B;

## Financials

By now, we have established the basic economics of Hibiscus’s business, including its revenues (i.e. oil production and oil price scenarios), costs (OPEX, ITDA), profitability (breakeven, future earnings potential) and balance sheet value (2P reserves, valuation). Moving on, we want to gain a deeper understanding of the 3 statements to anticipate any blind spots and risks. We’ll refer to the financial statements of both the FY20 annual report and the 2Q21 quarterly report in this analysis.

For the sake of brevity, I’ll only point out those line items which need extra attention, and skip over the rest. Feel free to go through the financial statements on your own to gain a better familiarity of the business.

https://preview.redd.it/h689bss79br41.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed47fce6a5c3815dd3d4f819e31f1ce39ccf4a0b

***Income Statement***

First, we’ll start with the Income Statement on page 135 of the AR20. **Revenues** are straightforward, as we’ve discussed above. **Cost of Sales** and **Administrative Expenses** fall under the jurisdiction of OPEX, which we’ve also seen earlier. Other Expenses are mostly made up of **Depreciation & Amortization** of RM 115m.

**Finance Costs** are where things start to get tricky. Why does a company which carries no debt have such huge amounts of finance costs? The reason can be found in Note 8, where it is revealed that the bulk of finance costs relate to the *unwinding of discount of provision for decommissioning costs* of RM 25m (Note 32).

https://preview.redd.it/4omjptbe9br41.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaabfc824134063100afa62edfd36a34a680fb60

This actually refers to the expected future costs of restoring the Anasuria and North Sabah fields to their original condition once the oil reserves have been depleted. Accounting standards require the company to provide for these decommissioning costs as they are *estimable* and *probable*. The way the decommissioning costs are accounted for is the same as an amortized loan, where the initial carrying value is recognized as a liability and the discount rate applied is reversed each year as an expense on the Income Statement. However, these expenses are largely non-cash in nature and do not necessitate a cash outflow every year (FY20: RM 69m).

*Unwinding of discount on non-current other payables* of RM 12m relate to contractual payments to the North Sabah sellers. We will discuss it later.

**Taxation** is another tricky subject, and is even more significant than Finance Costs at RM 161m. In gist, Hibiscus is subject to the 38% PITA (Petroleum Income Tax Act) under Malaysian jurisdiction, and the 30% Petroleum tax + 10% Supplementary tax under UK jurisdiction. Of the RM 161m, RM 41m of it relates to deferred tax which originates from the difference between tax treatment and accounting treatment on capitalized assets (accelerated depreciation vs straight-line depreciation). Nonetheless, what you should take away from this is that the tax expense is a tangible expense and material to breakeven analysis.

Fortunately, tax is a variable expense, and should not materially impact the cash flow of Hibiscus in today’s low oil price environment.

*Note: Cash outflows for Tax Paid in FY20 was RM 97m, substantially below the RM 161m tax expense.*

https://preview.redd.it/1xrnwzm89br41.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=c078bc3e18d9c79d9a6fbe1187803612753f69d8

***Balance Sheet***

The balance sheet of Hibiscus is unexciting; I’ll just bring your attention to those line items which need additional scrutiny. I’ll use the figures in the latest 2Q21 quarterly report (2Q21) and refer to the notes in AR20 for clarity.

We’ve already discussed *Intangible Assets* in the section above, so I won’t dwell on it again.

Moving on, the company has *Equipment* of RM 582m, largely relating to O&G assets (e.g. the Anasuria FPSO vessel and CAPEX incurred on production enhancement projects). *Restricted cash and bank balances* represent contractual obligations for decommissioning costs of the Anasuria Cluster, and are inaccessible for use in operations.

*Inventories* are relatively low, despite Hibiscus being an E&P company, so forex fluctuations on carrying value of inventories are relatively immaterial. Trade receivables largely relate to entitlements from Petronas and BP (both oil supermajors), and are hence quite safe from impairment. *Other receivables, deposits and prepayments* are significant as they relate to security deposits placed with sellers of the oil fields acquired; these should be ignored for cash flow purposes.

*^(Note: Total cash and bank balances do not include approximately RM 105 m proceeds from the North Sabah December 2019 offtake (which was received in January 2020))*

*Cash and bank balances* of RM 90m do not include RM 105m of proceeds from offtake received in 3Q21 (Jan 2020). Hence, the actual cash and bank balances as of 2Q21 approximate RM 200m.

**Liabilities** are a little more interesting. First, I’ll draw your attention to the significant *Deferred tax liabilities* of RM 457m. These largely relate to the amortization of CAPEX (i.e. Equipment and capitalized E&E expenses), which is given an accelerated depreciation treatment for tax purposes.

The way this works is that the government gives Hibiscus a favorable tax treatment on capital expenditures incurred via an accelerated depreciation schedule, so that the taxable income is less than usual. However, this leads to the taxable depreciation being utilized quicker than accounting depreciation, hence the tax payable merely deferred to a later period – when the tax depreciation runs out but accounting depreciation remains. Given the capital intensive nature of the business, it is understandable why *Deferred tax liabilities* are so large.

We’ve discussed *Provision for decommissioning costs* under the *Finance Costs* section earlier. They are also quite significant at RM 266m.

Notably, the *Other Payables and Accruals* are a hefty RM 431m. What do they relate to? Basically, they are contractual obligations to the sellers of the oil fields which are only payable upon oil prices reaching certain thresholds. Hence, while they are current in nature, they will only become payable when oil prices recover to previous highs, and are hence not an immediate cash outflow concern given today’s low oil prices.

***Cash Flow Statement***

There is nothing in the cash flow statement which warrants concern.

Notably, the company generated OCF of approximately RM 500m in FY20 and RM 116m in 2Q21. It further incurred RM 330m and RM 234m of CAPEX in FY20 and 2Q21 respectively, largely owing to production enhancement projects to increase the production rate of the Anasuria and North Sabah fields, which according to management estimates are accretive to ROI.

*Tax paid* was RM 97m in FY20 and RM 61m in 2Q21 (tax expense: RM 161m and RM 62m respectively).

&#x200B;

## Risks

There are a few obvious and not-so-obvious risks that one should be aware of before investing in Hibiscus. We shall not consider operational risks (e.g. uptime, OPEX) as they are outside the jurisdiction of the equity analyst. Instead, we shall focus on the financial and strategic risks largely outside the control of management. The main ones are:

· Oil prices remaining subdued for long periods of time

· Fluctuation of exchange rates

· Customer concentration risk

· 2P Reserves being less than estimated

· Significant current and non-current liabilities

· Potential issuance of equity

***Oil prices remaining subdued***

Of topmost concern in the minds of most analysts is whether Hibiscus has the wherewithal to sustain itself through this period of low oil prices (sub-$30). A quick and dirty estimate of annual cash outflow (i.e. **burn rate**) assuming a $20 oil world and historical production rates is between **RM 50m-70m per year**, which considering the RM 200m cash balance implies about 3-4 years of sustainability before the company runs out of cash and has to rely on external assistance for financing.

**Table 1: Hibiscus EBITDA at different oil price and exchange rates**

https://preview.redd.it/gxnekd6h9br41.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbfb9621a43480d11e3b49de79f61a6337b3d51

The above table shows different EBITDA scenarios (RM ‘m) given different oil prices (left column) and USD:MYR exchange rates (top row). Currently, oil prices are $27 and USD:MYR is 1:4.36.

Given conservative assumptions of average OPEX/bbl of $20 (current: $15), we can safely say that the company will be loss-making as long as oil remains at $20 or below (red). However, we can see that once oil prices hit $25, the company can tank the lower-end estimate of the annual burn rate of RM 50m (orange), while at RM $27 it can sufficiently muddle through the higher-end estimate of the annual burn rate of RM 70m (green).

Hence, we can assume that as long as the ***average*** oil price over the next 3-4 years remains above $25, Hibiscus should come out of this fine without the need for any external financing.

***Customer Concentration Risk***

With regards to customer concentration risk, there is not much the analyst or investor can do except to accept the risk. Fortunately, 80% of revenues can be attributed to two oil supermajors (Petronas and BP), hence the risk of default on contractual obligations and trade receivables seems to be quite diminished.

***2P Reserves being less than estimated***

2P Reserves being less than estimated is another risk that one should keep in mind. Fortunately, the current market cap is merely RM 714m – at half of estimated recoverable amounts of RM 1.468 billion – so there’s a decent margin of safety. In addition, there are other mitigating factors which shall be discussed in the next section (*‘Opportunities’*).

***Significant non-current and current liabilities***

The significant non-current and current liabilities have been addressed in the previous section. It has been determined that they pose no threat to immediate cash flow due to them being long-term in nature (e.g. decommissioning costs, deferred tax, etc). Hence, for the purpose of assessing going concern, their amounts should not be a cause for concern.

***Potential issuance of equity***

Finally, we come to the possibility of external financing being required in this low oil price environment. While the company should last 3-4 years on existing cash reserves, there is always the risk of other black swan events materializing (e.g. coronavirus) or simply oil prices remaining muted for longer than 4 years.

Furthermore, management has hinted that they wish to acquire new oil assets at presently depressed prices to increase daily production rate to a targeted 20,000 bbl by end-2021. They have room to acquire debt, but they may also wish to issue equity for this purpose. Hence, the possibility of dilution to existing shareholders cannot be entirely ruled out.

However, given management’s historical track record of prioritizing ROI and optimal capital allocation, and in consideration of the fact that the MD owns 10% of outstanding shares, there is some assurance that any potential acquisitions will be accretive to EPS and therefore valuations.

&#x200B;

## Opportunities

As with the existence of risk, the presence of material opportunities also looms over the company. Some of them are discussed below:

· Increased Daily Oil Production Rate

· Inclusion of 2C Resources

· Future oil prices exceeding $50 and effects from coronavirus dissipating

***Increased Daily Oil Production Rate***

The first and most obvious opportunity is the potential for increased production rate. We’ve seen in the last quarter (2Q21) that the North Sabah field increased its daily production rate by approximately 20% as a result of production enhancement projects (infill drilling), lowering OPEX/bbl as a result. To vastly oversimplify, infill drilling is the process of maximizing well density by drilling in the spaces between existing wells to improve oil production.

The same improvements are being undertaken at the Anasuria field via infill drilling, subsea debottlenecking, water injection and sidetracking of existing wells. Without boring you with industry jargon, this basically means future production rate is likely to improve going forward.

By how much can the oil production rate be improved by? Management estimates in their analyst presentation that enhancements in the Anasuria field will be able to yield **5,000 bbl/day** by 2021 (current: 2,500 bbl/day).

Similarly, improvements in the North Sabah field is expected to yield **7,000 bbl/day** by 2021 (current: 5,300 bbl/day).

This implies a total 2021 expected daily production rate from the two fields alone of **12,000 bbl/day** (current: 8,000 bbl/day). That’s a ***50% increase*** in yields which we haven’t factored into our valuation yet.

Furthermore, we haven’t considered any production from **existing 2C resources** (e.g. Marigold/Sunflower) or any potential acquisitions which may occur in the future. By management estimates, this can potentially increase production by another 8,000 bbl/day, bringing total production to **20,000 bbl/day**.

While this seems like a stretch of the imagination, it pays to keep them in mind when forecasting future revenues and valuations.

Just to play around with the numbers, I’ve come up with a sensitivity analysis of possible annual EBITDA at different oil prices and daily oil production rates:

**Table 2: Hibiscus EBITDA at different oil price and daily oil production rates**

https://preview.redd.it/jnpfhr5n9br41.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe4b512bc17f576d87529651140cc74cde3d159

*The left column represents different oil prices while the top row represents different daily oil production rates.*

The green column represents EBITDA at current daily production rate of 8,000 bbl/day; the orange column represents EBITDA at targeted daily production rate of 12,000 bbl/day; while the purple column represents EBITDA at maximum daily production rate of 20,000 bbl/day.

Even conservatively assuming increased estimated annual ITDA of RM 500m (FY20: RM 318m), and long-term average oil prices of $50 (FY20: $60), the estimated Net Profit and P/E ratio is potentially lucrative at daily oil production rates of 12,000 bbl/day and above.

***2C Resources***

Since we’re on the topic of improved daily oil production rate, it bears to pay in mind the relatively enormous potential from Hibiscus’s 2C Resources. North Sabah’s 2C Resources alone exceed 30 mmbbl; while those from the yet undiagnosed Marigold/Sunflower fields also reach 30 mmbbl. Altogether, 2C Resources exceed 70 mmbbl, which dwarfs the 44 mmbbl of 2P Reserves we have considered up to this point in our valuation estimates.

To refresh your memory, 2C Resources represents oil volumes which have been discovered but are not yet classified as “commercial”. This means that there is reasonable certainty of the oil being recoverable, as opposed to simply being in the very early stages of exploration. So, to be conservative, we will imagine that only **50% of 2C Resources** are eligible for reclassification to 2P reserves, i.e. 35 mmbbl of oil.

https://preview.redd.it/mto11iz7abr41.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9028ab0816b3d3e25067447f2c70acd3ebfc41a

This additional 35 mmbbl of oil represents an 80% increase to existing 2P reserves. Assuming the daily oil production rate increases similarly by 80%, we will arrive at **14,400 bbl/day** of oil production. According to *Table 2* above, this would yield an EBITDA of roughly **RM 630m** assuming $50 oil.

Comparing that estimated EBITDA to FY20’s actual EBITDA:

|| **FY20** |**FY21 (incl. 2C)**|**Difference**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| **Daily oil production (bbl/day)** | 8,626 |14,400|\+66%|
| **Average oil price (USD/bbl)** | $68.57 |$50|\-27%|
| **Average OPEX/bbl (USD)** | $16.64 |$20|\+20%|
| **EBITDA (RM ‘m)** |632|630|\-|

Hence, even conservatively assuming lower oil prices and higher OPEX/bbl (which should decrease in the presence of higher oil volumes) than last year, we get approximately the same EBITDA as FY20.

For the sake of completeness, let’s assume that Hibiscus issues twice the no. of existing shares over the next 10 years, effectively diluting shareholders by 50%. Even without accounting for the possibility of the acquisition of new oil fields, at the current market capitalization of RM 714m, the prospective P/E would be about 10x. Not too shabby.

***Future oil prices exceeding $50 and effects from coronavirus dissipating***

Hibiscus shares have recently been hit by a one-two punch from oil prices cratering from $60 to $30, as a result of both the Saudi-Russian dispute and depressed demand for oil due to coronavirus. This has massively increased supply and at the same time hugely depressed demand for oil (due to the globally coordinated lockdowns being implemented).

Given a long enough timeframe, I fully expect OPEC+ to come to an agreement and the economic effects from the coronavirus to dissipate, allowing oil prices to rebound. As we equity investors are aware, oil prices are cyclical and are bound to recover over the next 10 years.

When it does, valuations of O&G stocks (including Hibiscus’s) are likely to improve as investors overshoot expectations and begin to forecast higher oil prices into perpetuity, as they always tend to do in good times. When that time arrives, Hibiscus’s valuations are likely to become overoptimistic as all O&G stocks tend to do during oil upcycles, resulting in valuations far exceeding reasonable estimates of future earnings. If you can hold the shares up until then, it’s likely you will make much more on your investment than what we’ve been estimating.

## Conclusion

Wrapping up what we’ve discussed so far, we can conclude that Hibiscus’s market capitalization of RM 714m far undershoots reasonable estimates of fair value even under conservative assumptions of recoverable oil volumes and long-term average oil prices. As a value investor, I hesitate to assign a target share price, but it’s safe to say that this stock is worth at least RM 1.00 (current: RM 0.45). Risk is relatively contained and the upside far exceeds the downside. While I have no opinion on the short-term trajectory of oil prices, I can safely recommend this stock as a long-term Buy based on fundamental research.",31,0.89,1586228703.0

RED FLAGS: 

—-———————— page 106 ——————————-

Lehman’s exposure to High-Yield Instruments (Rated BB+ or lower) increased from 2006 to 2007 by 18 billion. One might think they just decided to invest more but there’s a catch if you read through the page.

“The increase in high-yield positions form 06 to 07 is primarily from funded lending commitments that have not been syndicated.”

This means that the company made a promise to buy these instruments and expected to use the public’s money (to syndicate) to do so, instead they weren’t able to get fundings from investors for these commitments and so they ended up taking on the exposure themselves.

Personal opinion:

Apart from them not being able to syndicate the lending, a 30bln exposure to low-quality investments (which were probably high-yielding trash) with such a low liquidity position is at the very least deeply risky

t3_fzaeqw,A Diamond in the Rough - Debated Welcome!,"Many investors hunting for multi-baggers have their eyes set on companies that are 1) aligned with popular narrative and 2) growing revenue at a remarkable clip, reasoning that if revenue growth continues then the equity value will participate in a non-linear manner. Think $ZM or $TSLA. $ZM's been the beneficiary of the work from home narrative, while $TSLA's been on the front-line of pushing back against climate change in a capitalistic way. I won't get into whether I think either's a good investment in this thread, but they're both *stories* that investors have latched onto for a big potential payday.

The company I'm bullish on (and, disclosure, am long) is $HNRG, Hallador Energy, perhaps the antithesis of these two prior stocks as far as investing approach goes. While the $ZM thesis relies on the company being able to parlay the huge amount of new (unpaid) user-ship into cash flow, $HNRG is reliably free cash flow positive. While $TSLA vehicles run exclusively on electricity, $HNRG creates the electricity that $TSLA vehicles utilize, and yet you'd never find $HNRG in an ESG index.

Hallador is a miner of steam coal, coal that's burned by utilities to produce electricity. The obvious point is that coal usage is diminishing in the US. That's true, and has been true for decades, but coal will continue to play a large part in utilities' fuel-mix as renewables take up larger share; because it's a base-load fuel, coal has been depended on to power electrical grids when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Similarly, there's an ease of storage: you can simply stack it on-site and wait for a rainy day.

Coal companies have been failing left and right. There are ugly profiles of Murray / Foresight ($FELP) in the WSJ ([It's real ugly out there.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/murray-energy-pushed-to-brink-of-liquidation-11585661530) ). Stock charts for coal companies -- e.g., Peabody ($BTU), Contura ($CTRA), Alliance ($ARLP), Arch ($ARCH) -- are depressing. $HNRG's stock chart is no less bleak, down >60% year-to-date, and an unspeakable amount from its peak.

&#x200B;

[$HNRG over five years...Not pretty](https://preview.redd.it/9bcbxg3738s41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea67f891cdc352ec6d2ba803860746aa1cb8b735)

And yet, $HNRG's value proposition is different than these much larger companies. Peabody ($BTU) proudly proclaims that it's the largest private-sector coal company in the world, and that's precisely its problem. In a secularly declining industry, you don't want a dominant position. Hallador, by contrast, sells \~70% of its production inside the state of Indiana, a dependable friend of the fuel source as many utilities there rely heavily on coal-burning plants and many voters live in towns kept alive by the mining industry.

Lack of popularity alone isn't killing the coal share prices, though. The existential problem is debt. When these large companies were selling at higher volumes and higher prices, the debtloads looked responsible. But at this moment of economic contraction and of coal oversupply, the debt is beginning to look crushing. These large companies rely on the so-called ""spot market,"" selling their tons as they're producing them at the prevailing rate. More than 50% of sales in a given year for most large producers come from the spot market, as opposed to having pre-arranged sales agreements in place.

That's where Hallador is different. They have 100% of this upcoming year's projected sales already sold and at fixed prices. Hallador has sold 6.7M tons at $40/ton. Similarly, they have \~80% of next year's sales (2021) already sold at that same price, and \~75% of 2022 done at an even higher price. The reason this is so essential is that the current ""spot"" price of IL basin coal (the type they produce) is \~$33. Selling at that price-point would push a company like Hallador to bankruptcy in short, but they're mostly pre-sold for three years while their competitors are heading for liquidation.

&#x200B;

[From 10-K... 85&#37; of sales through 2022](https://preview.redd.it/zyvrh3x738s41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3335841800b05d78badf04bee1cd0cb904765248)

Arguably, there is no institutional investor interest in the name these days. With it being a coal company, not many endowments would want to bother with it for ESG reasons. It's also a very small cap stock now, which keeps large investors away; bear in mind, its enterprise value approached $1bn at one moment within the last ten years, and yet they produced the most coal ever in 2019. The disconnect between investor interest and business prospects is stark. Let's look at some numbers.

The company did \~$70M of EBITDA in 2019, and its enterprise value as of Friday was charitably \~$200M. For pricing, that's less than 3x last 12 month's EBITDA. Next year, they expect to do in the neighborhood of $65M of EBITDA. (By the way, the reason you should use EBITDA as opposed to an accounting-earnings denominator metric like P/E is because of the DD&A. You're probably familiar with depreciation and amortization, but what's the other D? That's depletion, and it makes intuitive sense why you'd add that back. If you're a coal company, you hold the land/minerals on your balance sheet as an asset. As you're digging the asset out of the ground, you're reducing your assets, which allows you reduce your taxes by charging that depletion as a loss of value, but you keep the cash; you're monetizing your in-the-ground assets. In 2019, you'll also see that they wrote down the value of a mine that they closed because it wasn't profitable enough to keep operating in this environment.)

&#x200B;

What's amazing here is that the market cap has dwindled to be just under $30M as of Friday's close. And so you're able to buy this at about 100% free cash flow yield (FCF was \~$30M for 2019). Hallador has guided (see transcript: [Seeking Alpha transcript 4Q19](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4331060-hallador-energy-company-hnrg-ceo-brent-bilsland-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) ) that they aim to pay down $35M of debt in 2020. For easy math, lets say the (very depressed) enterprise value of this company is $200M: $170M of debt and $30M equity. Suppose Hallador executes as they say, and the debt goes to $135M. That means the equity would've grown to $65M, over a 100% return from the $30M.

To be clear, the rational risk here is that the company goes bankrupt. They have $180M of gross debt, and their covenants say that the debt has to be no more than 2.75x adjusted EBITDA by year-end 2020. Lets say they do $60M of adj EBITDA this year (less than last year, despite closing the lower margin mine). The maximum debt debt they could have is $165M. So it could be tight. But Hallador (same transcript as above) guided that they aim to generate $50M of free cash flow this year: through 1) the operating business, 2) the reduced capital expenditures from closing the higher cost mine and literally driving the equipment down to their better-producing mines, and 3) from selling inventory they'd built up ahead of the coming shipping seasons. \[Also, for those focused on COVID, $HNRG is an essential business in Indiana; ventilators run on electricity.\] Additionally, they have a \~$5M dividend they could elect not to pay and use that to reduce debt if necessary.

In summary, I ask a question. People like YOLO call options, right? Aren't buying call options a pretty awesome deal? Yes and no. Yes because it's non-recourse leverage, meaning you can only lose the premium (and they can't come after your house), and you can make an unlimited amount of money. BUT actual call options have to overcome implied volatility and overcome timing risks (both time decay of option itself and having a definite expiry date). At worst, the investment proposition for buying Hallador is a call option. Your max loss is the premium - however much you put in - in the event they go bankrupt. But your maximum gain is uncapped on this levered company that's been thrown out with the bathwater. Consider the math if they survive this year and get re-rated to 5x EBITDA in two years. If EBITDA's $75M, then that'd be an enterprise value of $375. If they've paid down $60M of debt (30/yr), then that's $120M of debt remaining, implying equity of $255M. (They've traded nearly double this before). On $30M of equity today, that's about an eight-bagger. And instead of having time-decay on the option, to the extent they're paying the dividend, that carries north of 15%/yr at these prices.

I welcome the debate. Thanks for reading.

t3_fzyhkn,Betsson AB (BETS B) - VIC Application Practice,"I wrote this as practice for my VIC application. Posting this here to try and get some feedback and spread the word on a decent idea. I'm fairly new to this. I have no business education and I don't work in the finance industry thus my experience is limited.

&#x200B;

Betsson AB (BETS B) is a Swedish company that operates online casinos and sportsbooks in regulated European markets. Their business model consists of acquiring and conducting business through locally recognized strong brands as opposed to a single global brand. To support this the company operates a single technological platform that hosts all brands and subsidiary casinos, which allows for cost-effective and scalable operations.

1. Low CapEx requirements and their cost model is among the lowest in the industry. Currently sporting a 76% ROIC to after-tax FCF and very modest leverage both at present and historically.
2. Rough FY 2019 has investor expectations at an all-time low. Revenues from nordic markets, the company's biggest markets, declined -30% due to new regulation, mainly new gambling taxes and restrictions on customer loyalty/marketing incentives. Thanks to growth in other markets total revenues declined only -5% and EBIT margin dropped from \~22% to \~16,5% as gambling tax is booked under operational expenses. The new regulation has been in effect the entire FY of 2019, thus I believe we've seen the worst, if not all, of the impact from the new regulation and that revenues will normalize from here on. The company is increasingly diversifying across geographical markets to combat this and potential future new regulation.
3. Growing customer base. Annual cash deposits by customers have grown 13,5% CAGR the last 5 years and grew 6% in 2019 The number of active customers per annum has grown at 11,9% 5-year CAGR and grew 2,7% in 2019.
4. Sportsbetting is 24% of the company's revenue. They have developed an in house sportsbook which they are looking to license to other operators. First B2B agreement was signed early Q1 2020 and there is possibility of growth in this segment. I don't model this in my valuation due to uncertainty.
5. Satisfactory capital allocation. Very selective M&A where low price and strong brands are the main focus. The company repurchased around 2 million shares in march but unfortunately, the program is fully exhausted and a new program needs AGM permission.
6. Attractive valuation. The share is trading at 9x EV/FCF (after-tax) and 8,1x EV/EBIT whereas valuations for the industry are crazy high with an average of 37,5x EV/FCF. The closest comparable trades at 14,6x EV/FCF meaning about a 40% relative discount. Assuming a modest 2% growth per annum in FCF, with CapEx and debt staying at 2019 levels, FCF at year 2023 sits at around 832 million SEK. Given the ROIC and modest growth potential an EV/FCF multiple of 15 (6,66% FCF yield) seems reasonable given the risky business, but you might want to be more conservative.

That means upside of around 90% to the current price in 2-3 years time with a very limited downside already baked into the price. Even if nordic revenues should drop further or additional surprise regulation strikes in another market you would not lose money.",6,0.73,1586704705.0
t3_fzs07w,The Fall of the US Banking Sector,"Over the last 20 years we have noticed interest rates have been much lower than the previous 20 years, reaching new lows after each cycle. Accommodative monetary policies have become the standard tool to jumpstart economies after each downturn. This is no different in 2020 as we feel the effects of COVID-19 where long term interest rates have again fallen to the same levels as those experienced in the GFC. Low interest rates usually stimulate the financial equities markets by increasing spending and credit, lowering the discount rate and making the higher returns provided by equities more attractive. However, do we see the same effects in the banking sector which has a unique and more direct relationship with interest rates?

Interest rates in Japan and Europe have been at or below zero for the last decade which has also coincided with significant downwards pressure in the stock price of each regions banking sector. I want to investigate the validity of a causal effect in this relationship and how it may affect US banks in the next decade as the US heads back towards the zero lower bound and potential negative rate territory.

**Banking Sector Performance in a Low Interest Rate Environment**

Following the global financial crisis all three bank indices in the US, Japan and Euro area saw their prices drop more than 60% (see Fig. 1). Banks in Japan and the Euro area never saw their prices make meaningful recoveries since in the backdrop of zero to negative interest rates. However, banks in the US recovered to their 2007 highs in the backdrop of increasing interest rates. 

[Figure 1: Central Bank Interest Rates and Performance of Bank Indices Over 20 Years](https://imgur.com/Cu3fCE6)


An argument could be made that this could simply be a reflection of the US stock market having had one of the best bull markets this last decade whilst both Japan and Euro stock markets have struggled. The counter argument is that although the US bank index (KBW) has largely tracked the US market index (SPY) both the Japan and Euro bank indices (TOPIX and SX7E) have de-coupled from their respective market indices (Nikkei and EURO Stoxx 50). Both the Nikkei and EURO Stoxx 50 have largely recovered their losses from the GFC but again the banks in either region have not. 

[Figure 2: Performance of Bank and Market Indices in Japan, the Euro Area and the US](https://imgur.com/G263RPz)

Another argument one could make is that the difference in price growth could be due to a result of the proliferation of share buybacks that has occurred in the US stock market compared to that of Japan and the Euro area. Banks also usually yield high dividends which are not reflected in the chart in Fig. 1. I don’t have the data to explore the impact of share buybacks and dividends further, but I assume the significant divergence in the indices are little explained by share buybacks and dividends alone.  

For the same trends we see in Japan and Europe to hold true in the US an assumption must be made that the Federal Reserve (FED) will hold interest rates near or potentially even below zero for a significant period. I believe there is a high probability that this will be the case as we saw in 2018 tightening monetary policy resulted in fear in the financial markets. It will become ever more difficult for reserve banks to unwind reserve assets and pull back from accommodative policies as low interest rates become the framework on which the new economy is built on. 

**Interest Rate Effects on Bank Profitability**

First, I want to examine the effect of reserve bank interest rate policies on bank profitability. The impact that interest rate changes will have will depend on a range of variables such as the banks asset and debt portfolio, the maturity gap between its assets and liabilities and non-interest portion of income (such as fee income for products and services). 

The effect of lower interest rates on profitability come directly from the level of rates and the yield curve. The effect of the level of interest rates can be summarized as follows:

* Banks partially fund their operations with retail deposit at rates set as a markdown on market rates. This markdown is compressed as interest rates decrease because the deposit rate cannot fall below zero. Therefore, as interest rates decrease, the net interest rate margin on banks also decreases. 

* Lower interest rates will generally induce more lending and investments in riskier assets in search for higher returns. This is the whole point of accommodative monetary policy (low interest rates) and may increase net interest rate margins. However, this depends on economic conditions as a weak economic outlook (precisely the reason why rates may be low) can limit demand for loans. 

The effect of the yield curve is explained by the operation of banks taking short-term loans and granting longer term loans. Therefore, net interest rate margins are compressed when the yield curve flattens and increased when the yield curve steepens.

If we examine the net interest rate margin of banks in all three regions, we see an overall downtrend, in-line with that of central bank interest rate policies (see Fig. 3). The net interest rate margin is lowest (Japan) for the region with the lowest average interest rate over the last 20 years and vice versa (US). The average net interest rate income growth follows the same trend, where the growth is lowest (Japan) for the region with the lowest average interest rate over the last 20 years and vice versa (US). 

[Figure 3: Interest Margins and Net Interest Income Performance over the Last 20 Years](https://imgur.com/qa6tGk2)

In all three regions, despite a low interest rate environment, the average net interest income portion of total income remains steady (except for the period following the GFC). Banks have seemingly not been able to supplement the loss in net interest margin with non-interest income through this period. 

In conclusion there will likely be downwards pressure on the income and share price of bank stocks in the US in the next cycle. I don’t believe we will see the same catastrophic failure of the banking sector like we saw in the GFC. Banks are extremely well capitalized with healthy liquidity and stable funding rates following the GFC and resulting stringent regulations through Basel III. Liquidity issues have been further dampened by the FED initiating ‘infinite QE’ and buying up seemingly every type of asset save for equities.",89,0.89,1586674890.0

t3_g14svr,Net-net cash shells,"When looking through a list of saved companies just now I noticed Hermes Pacific Investments plc has dropped 30% this morning.

*Why was this company on my list?*

When looking for net-nets (companies selling for less than their current assets - liabilities), I came across Hermes.

With the share price drop, they are now trading at less than 1/3 of the net-net value.

*What's the situation?*

The company appears to me to be a 'cash shell', though I have no insight into the management's strategy and I could be wrong. Cash shells are defined as companies with no operating business that are used to provide an easy route to the stock market for other companies.

Regardless of the management's intention, the company appears to have done nothing but burn £100k per year for several years. The market cap is just under £1M and it has £3.6M in cash with virtually no other assets or liabilities.

The obvious course of action to me right now to maximise shareholder value would be for the company to dissolve and distribute the money to the shareholders. 86% of shares are 'not in public hands', so assuming they are all owned by the directors, 86% of £3.6M today seems a lot better than slowly drawing £100k per year, which makes me think they're not doing this to just slowly bleed the company dry. The only reason, then, I can think of for the current course of action is that management genuinely believe they'll provide greater returns to shareholders by waiting for the right reverse merger opportunity to come along.

I have no experience with cash shells or net-nets and would be very keen to hear thoughts or links to research from anyone with experience in this area.",32,0.9,1586868044.0

t3_g57n47,SKAS - Brief Thesis,"**Introduction**

Saker Aviation Services Inc. (OTC: SKAS) is a $3.26M Market Cap company that operates in aviation services and is currently being priced at less than liquidation value. Given the size of the company and liquidity of the shares, this is a thesis for personal accounts. Any feedback and questions are welcomed.

&#x200B;

**Company Description**

Saker Aviation Services Inc. operates in aviation services. It serves as the operator of a heliport, a fixed base operation (FBO), a provider of aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul services, and consultant for non-owned seaplane base. The company focuses on safety, outstanding customer service, and personalized solutions and it offers full-service FBOs provide products and services for commercial airlines, private and business jets, military aircraft, and rotor aircraft. Geographically, business activities are carried out throughout the region of the United States.

Prior to the spread of COVID 19, this stock traded at around $6 a share and started crashing around the beginning of March to approximately $3 a share. I believe that the main drivers surrounding the decrease in share price are the following: 

1. Negative sentiment over the Aviation industry due to travel restrictions and COVID - 19
2. The company has operations in New York, which has been severely impacted by COVID – 19
3. Recessionary concerns as its services (such as private flights) are cyclical

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Based on the current Market Capitalization of $3.26M and a Net Cash position of $3.14M (Cash and Cash Equivalents less Leases, no other long term debt), you would be paying $127k for the remaining net operating assets which has a book value of approximately $2.44M (price to book of just the net operating assets is 0.05). Put differently, this company’s net operating assets are priced lower than liquidation value. As a point of reference, its Noncash Net Working Capital is 392k, 3x the $127k.  

Since 2010, this company has been profitable except for one year due to a one-off issue that doesn’t seem likely to repeat itself. Depending on your perspective of how profitable this business will be in the future, the net operating assets of the company could be worth well above book value. For conservatism, if you assume that the company could be liquidated for half of book value, you are risking $127k for a profit of $1.10 M. 

&#x200B;

**Risks**

* COVID 19 lasts longer than expected, the company burns more cash and earns less revenue.
* Cash collections on current Accounts Receivable and Notes Receivable worsens as people try to delay making payments during COVID 19
* A recession reduces demand for its services

&#x200B;

**Catalysts**

1. Liquidation
2. SKAS is acquired 
3. America/the world gets COVID 19 under control and the economy recovers

t3_g6sxl5,Apple Aims to Sell Macs With Its Own Chips Starting in 2021,"[**https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/apple-aims-to-sell-macs-with-its-own-chips-starting-in-2021**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/apple-aims-to-sell-macs-with-its-own-chips-starting-in-2021)

**Basic** **Summary:**

Code named ""Project Kalamata"", information which first appeared in 2018 and then progressively has been unveiled as more leaks have occurred show Apple plans to start switching from Intel to custom Mac ARM processors in 2021. Apple’s ARM Mac chips in development are based on the A14 processor coming to the iPhone and iPad this year and next year respectively.

**My Personal Thoughts:**

In my opinion, the writing has been on the wall for some time at this point with respect to Apple and Intel. In 2010, Apple went with its own mobile processor for the iPhone. In 2016, it started doing its own Mac security/power processors (T1/T2). Later this year, Apple is replacing Intel with its own modems.

One of the foundational aspects of Apple has always been its core desire to control 100% of its stack from top to bottom, sometimes at the detriment or some might say ""exploitation"" of its vendors.

My personal take on it, at least from what I've seen, is that Apple has an extraordinary level of perfectionism that it expects of itself and by association, its vendors too. As long as vendors can continue to meet the onerous demands that Apple places on them, they'll be safe. Apple internally, however, will be working on their own in-house version of the hardware, and the moment things start to degrade in quality or Apple becomes unsatisfied with performance, there is absolutely no hesitation in axing them off.

The relationship between Apple and Intel as a vendor has generally always been pretty good. Intel was able to meet the expectations that Apple asked for year after year, until of course, at some point a catalyst occurred that made Apple decide it was time to make the switch. I believe this was a result of Intel's exceptional failure in managing to get its 10nm process working. Originally expected to be completed by 2014, for the past six years, Intel has been unable to get 10nm working, effectively having to make do with re-releasing processors every year from its old 14nm platform.

If I had to make a guess as to when the breaking point was reached in terms of Apple deciding that its relationship with Intel was no longer working out, it would probably be around 2016, when Intel released its 7th generation Kaby Lake ""14nm+"" processors.

There are other factors I believe that have influenced parts of this decision, which in no particular order are:

1. The growing proliferation of non-mobile ARM based computers. Take Microsoft's recent Surface notebook release.
2. 32-bit to 64-bit ARM transition, which was completed with the T2 co-processor release.
3. Increasing compatibility of commonly used programs that previously required x86 or would otherwise experience significant performance degradation.
4. External pressure from a lack of advancement and perceived stagnation in recent Mac releases pushing them to make changes (Influenced partially by Intel's inability to provide meaningful enough performance improvements).

For those of you that follow this space, I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are. I'm sure there are things I'm missing.",99,0.96,1587669495.0
t3_g6ov1t,Adjusting for aggressive pension plan expected returns?,"Given that companies assume pretty generous pension plan returns (despite majority invested into govt and corp bonds), I was trying to think of a way to adjust their expected returns and see a more realistic picture of the level of pension funding.

Is the following logic valid? I am using GM here, all data from their 2019 10K. I’m just looking at their US pensions here.

* Expected LT return on plan assets: 5.9%
* Assumed LT return on plan assets: 4.0%
* Impact of 25 bps decrease in expected return on 2020 pension expense: $139 mn
* Impact of 190 bp decrease in expected return: $1,056 mn
* Years of benefit payments: 10
* Discount rate for benefit obligations: 3.2%

Using all of the above, I do a 10 year annuity for $1,056 mn / year discounted at 3.2%, to arrive at an additional $8,920 mn that needs to be funded at some point using my expectation of pension plan return.

Would appreciate discussion over some of the multiples & margins discussed, such as...

"" West’s agreement calls for him to receive a royalty around 15% of Yeezy revenue from Adidas. Upon closer inspection, it appears some expenses are carved out of that slice, bringing his actual cut closer to 11% ""

and...

"" A safer way to value it: as a royalty stream, like music publishing or film residuals... Conservatively, as we typically are with such figures, a 10x multiple, applied to West’s Yeezy cut of $140 million, makes his stake worth about $1.4 billion. But that’s a private, highly illiquid $1.4 billion—our rule-of-thumb for private assets like that is to lop off at least 10%. That’s $1.26 billion.""

**1. Business Tenets** 

**1.1 Is the business simple and understandable?** 

Costco operates a relatively simple and understandable business. Revenues are derived from sales of commodity items and membership fees. 97% of revenues are derived from net and sales and 3% from membership fees, both metrics have increased slightly since 2017. 

Operations are worldwide (12 countries as 2019), but 67% of the 782 warehouses are located in the US and Canada. Expenses are derived from merchandise cost and SGA mostly, 87% and 3% of total revenues respectively. 

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by 10% from 2018 to 2019. 

In terms of labour relations, Costco stands as a desirable employer. On top of offering health and retirement benefits above competitors, Costco’s employees perceive on average above minimum wage. Costco is involved in several litigations regarding the treatment of seasonal employees and unfair compensation, these litigations should not affect future performance. 

Price flexibility is minimal, pricing and product offering are the main factors to succeed in the industry. Costco achieves price differentiation through discounts on big purchases and running tight inbound logistics. Costco would have to absorb the reduction in prices internally instead of passing the burden to members, in case of aggressive competition. 

Capital allocation has remained stable for the past two years, despite the increase in net sales (18.3%). ROE decreased from 0.25 to 0.24 in 2017-2019, and ROA increased from 0.07 to 0.08 in the same period. Dividends decreased considerably from $8.90 to $2.44 in 2017-2019 or 74.6%, this should work as a catalyst for the stock to appreciate as resources are used to buyback stocks instead.

**1.2 Does the business have a consistent operating history?** 

Yes, the company has been doing the same business for the past 43 years. The model delivers value to members. Renewal rates are in the high 80s in the US. The average annual sales per location are growing at 9% annually. The business model is shifting insofar as the company is deriving 4% of total sales from its online platform. In 2017, the average annual sales growth per location was only 4%. By 2019, the figure grew to 9%, way above the goal of 5% stated in the growth strategy. The reason for this growth is the expansion of operations outside of the US and Canada regions. Does the fact that the company is shifting resources to its online offering and locations overseas changes the underlying nature of the business? Considering that the original wholesale discount model delivers value, I see these changes as necessary adaptations to a new environment instead of deep changes in the underlying nature of the business.

**1.3 Does the business have favourable long-term prospects?** 

Costco should last for the next 25 years regardless of future recessions, and/or inflations/devaluation of the American dollar. The services and products of the company are: 1- desired, the majority of its offering is acyclical and members have to replenish them constantly. 2- has no close substitute, most of the offering is available at other retailers; however, Costco’s prices, private label brands and special offerings are unique and offer value to members. 3- is not regulated, there are no constraints in terms of prices besides the competition. Overall, the former factors, plus the large network of warehouses, distribution centers and food processing plants create a moat around Costco.

**2. Management Tenets**  

**2.1 Is management rational?** 

Despite its maturity, Costco allocates 12% of net sales into the construction and development of new warehouses. 25 new warehouses were opened and net sales increased by 8% in 2019. The stock repurchase program was retired. Additionally, 1.09 and 1.76 million shares were repurchased at an average of $225.16 and $183.13 during 2019 and 2018 respectively. In April 2019, a new repurchase program in the amount of 4 million was authorized. Cash dividends per common share declined by 73% from 2017 to 2019. Overall, management is allocating earnings into the construction of new warehouses and the repurchase of shares instead of paying cash dividends.

**2.2. Is management candid with shareholders?** 

Yes, it is. Annual reports do a solid job of detailing each of the risks that the company faces. Management informs shareholders about risks related to foreign currency, gasoline price fluctuations, exposure to the China-US trade war, regulations on wages and healthcare, cannibalization of sales from new locations, etc. Moreover, a 5% growth in sales annually is clearly defined as the benchmark to measure performance.

**2.3 Does management resist the institutional imperative?** 

Yes. Costco has avoided the minimization of its employees’ salaries and benefits despite the industry trend of reducing costs through minimum wages. Moreover, Costco grew organically instead of M&A during the last bull market. 

**3. Financial Tenets** 

**3.1 Focus on return on equity, not earnings per share** 

Return on equity has improved exponentially from 12.5% in 2011 to 26.10% as of 2019, as it is expected to continue increasing as Costco expands operations internationally. 

\*The company does not present marketable securities in the financials. 

Overall, management has been successful at generating returns given the capital employed.

**3.2 Calculate “Owner Earnings” to get a true reflection of the value** 

Owner earnings = Net income +  depreciation and amortization + depletion – capital expenditures + additional working capital 

Owner earnings in 2019  = 3659 + 1492 - 2865 = 2,286

Owner earnings in 2016  = 2679 + 1370 - 2502 = 1,547

Owner earnings are increasing substantially as economies of scale increase the profitability of each location. 

**3.3 Look for companies with high-profit margins**  

SGE as a % of sales has remained stable at 10% despite the constant addition of new locations. 

Operating profit margin 2019 = 2.45 

Operating profit margin 2017 = 2.12 

Operating margins are high for the industry, and they are increasing as operations expand. 

**3.4 For every dollar retained, make sure the company has created at least one dollar of market value** 

Retained earnings accounted for $10258 in 2019, which is an increment of $2372 from the $7887 of 2018. 

At the same time, the market value of the company increased from $217 per share (438,437) at the end of 2017 to $296 per share (438,775) at the end of 2019. 

Thus, market value increased from $95,140,800 to $129,877,400 or roughly $34,737 million which is considerably higher than the increment in retained earnings.

**Market Tenets** 

**4.1 What is the value of the business?** 

Using this publication as a guide

[https://medium.com/popularengineering/how-to-calculate-the-intrinsic-value-of-stocks-like-warren-buffett-f9b97e3738ba](https://medium.com/popularengineering/how-to-calculate-the-intrinsic-value-of-stocks-like-warren-buffett-f9b97e3738ba)

I ended up with the following numbers: 3% expected growth of earnings per share,10% discount rate, DCF 23.95$ per share, terminal value 99.17$ per share. This leaves me with an intrinsic value of $123.12 per share for Costco which is less than half of the current market price of the stock ($310). 

**4.2 Can the business be purchased at a significant discount to its value?**

No, Costco is currently trading at $310 per share or 35 PER which is substantially overvalued according to the analysis. 

Disclaimer: I do not own Costco stock. This was a learning exercise only. This is my first valuation and I would like to know what I could do better next time. Please let me know if you have any constructive criticism to offer, especially regarding my intrinsic value. Does estimating an intrinsic value of $123 per share makes sense? I feel like I probably messed something up along the way. 

Also, I used “The Warren Buffett Way” as a guideline for the analysis.

t3_g871k7,Forecasting a revenue beat for an Oil Tanker stock (spreadsheet included),"Hi everyone,

Given the current supply glut in oil, buying stock in tankers in anticipation of demand for floating storage is not a new idea. Nevertheless, I was interested in understanding whether there was still any upside to the trade.

I chose DHT Holdings because it is a pure-play on tankers, with a fleet of 27 VLCCs providing 100% of the revenue and 96% of the costs. My goal was simply to forecast the 2020 revenue, using the most recent CapIQ estimate of $646m (updated as of Apr 21st) as a benchmark.

The key details and inputs of the model are as follows – would love to see some discussion in the comments of whether you think they are realistic.

* Time-charter rates don't need to be estimated, they are stated in the annual reports. 10 of the 27 VLCCs have been chartered at a fixed rate (4 at $32k a day, 6 at $67k a day) for all of 2020.
* The harder part is estimating the spot-charter revenue. To do this, I have assumed that there will be a number of ""high-demand days"", for which DHT can charge a ""high-demand rate"", then for the rest of the year they charge a ""low-demand"" rate.
* For the low-demand spot rate, I assume it will revert to 2019's value of $60k a day on average across all days of the year (across all VLCCs).
* I initially estimate 60 high-demand days, i.e 2 months of high demand for floating storage
* The most important input is the high-demand daily rate, i.e how much DHT can charge a day for spot charter of a VLCC. I estimate the lower bound to be $130k, which is roughly 2x their 2020 fixed charter rate of 67k (the 2x is based on the 2019 time:spot ratio). I inferred the upper bound from the futures curve to be about $350k.  This, combined with some random sources on the internet (reddit, seekingalpha), gives a daily rate of anywhere between $200k and $250k.

**Using 60 high-demand days, a high-demand rate of $200k/day, and a low-demand rate of $60k/day, my forecasted 2020 Revenue is $710m, a 10% surprise over the CapIQ estimate of $646m.**

I include a sensitivity analysis - across a range of different assumptions, the CapIQ estimate looks pessimistic.

The spreadsheet is [here](https://github.com/robertmartin8/RandomWalks/blob/master/valuations/DHT_tankers.xlsx). Feel free to play around and let me know what you think! For more detail on how I estimated the inputs, I've written a blog post [here](https://reasonabledeviations.com/2020/04/24/oil-storage/).

EDIT: based on actual charter rates from /u/dolphinBuns, I think 200-250k is a little optimistic. I'd be inclined to revise that estimate to 175-225k.

# Version 2, with python

I spent some time yesterday working on this – it's not perfect, but I'm ready to share what I've done. This model is mechanically more complex, but conceptually more simple. I wrote a python script to do the following:

&#x200B;

* Pull all of the recent TankersInternational tweets into python. I stopped at Jan 1, so I will be missing some of the spot charters that were made in 2019.
* Parse those tweets to get: ship name, daily rate, number of days chartered, start date. There might be some mistakes here, since I'm not quite sure what conventions TankersInternational is using.
* Manually input the data from the Apr 1st press release on the DHT website announcing 6 time-charters, as well as the already-booked charters mentioned in the 2019 annual report
* Build a table (pandas dataframe) with 365 columns (one for each day) and 27 rows (one for each ship). Fill in the data for the days we know.
* Output to excel

At this point, the sum total is **285m in revenue**. To clarify, this represents all of the voyages that have been already chartered. This is a sample of the excel spreadsheet:

https://preview.redd.it/6m3pkopn1bv41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c83f7a229d79f273646e8df9a2ca571b51d4407

The zeros correspond to days that I don't have any known information for. In the previous post, I used a 2-stage model to estimate these unknown spot rates. However, in this post I have done something a lot simpler: I replaced every missing entry with the mean value of non-missing entries.

https://preview.redd.it/j9p89mzo1bv41.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=60ff866a110249dffaeda6620503661003f2a2a9

&#x200B;

The result of this exercise is a forecasted 2020 revenue of $**652m,** very close to CapIQ's estimate of $646m. Of course, it's up to you to decide whether the simple procedure of using the means

It would be possible to use this spreadsheet to instead estimate quarterly revenue (just stop at column 90), but I haven't done so.

**TL;DR: DHT's already-arranged 2020 charters represent $285m in revenue. Extrapolating these charter rates gives an annual revenue of $652m, in line with CapIQ's estimate.**

I have put the excel spreadsheet and python code on [github](https://github.com/robertmartin8/pValuation/tree/master/OilTankers) – feel free to download and have a play. If you have a github account, I'd appreciate if you left a star!

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to allocate any more time to improving the model, but would be happy to answer any questions below.",100,0.96,1587870757.0

**Update**

Some people have mentioned the risk of CF commoditization. I'm not an expert in this space and have reached out to the company's IR to understand how the company is doing to mitigate commoditization and competition.

*Since it's from IR, take it with a grain of salt.*

Here's the response:

>In response to your question, there are distinct differences between aerospace qualified composites that Hexcel manufacturers and industrial-grade composites. Hexcel is focused on aerospace-composites. We do not see aerospace composites as trending towards commoditization. Industrial grade composites are a different discussion. Here are key barriers to consider that minimize the commoditization of aerospace composites:  
>  
>\* Intellectual property:  It is very difficult to create the formulations for aerospace carbon      fiber.  Hexcel is one of just a few competitors globally that      manufacture all three grades of aerospace carbon fiber.  
>  
>\* Manufacturing  process:   Aerospace-qualified carbon  fiber is manufactured under very high tension, much higher than industrial      fibers.  This takes purpose-built machinery and extensive experience to manufacture consistent quality and high yields that ensure a profit is      generated. Again, very few companies globally can manufacture      aerospace-qualified carbon fiber.  
>  
>\*Resin systems:   In addition to carbon fiber manufacturing, resin systems are designed to      optimize the interface with the carbon fiber. Aerospace-grade resin systems represent additional intellectual property and manufacturing prowess  
>  
>\*Vertical integration:  Hexcel is vertically integrated to a greater degree than our competitors,      enabling us to differentiate our product offering.  
>  
>\*Reputation:  Reputation is paramount in aerospace to ensure the safety and integrity of      the aircraft material and production. Consistent quality and on-time delivery are very important for aircraft manufacturing. Hexcel has a solid      industry reputation.  
>  
>\*Traceability:  All material and parts must be traceable from the final aircraft back to      their original manufacture. This requires an information technology      platform and robust processes. This would take significant time for a new      entrant to develop.  
>  
>\*Sole-source:   We are often sole-sourced for the life of an aircraft platform, limiting the potential for a new entrant to capture share  
>  
>\*Research: We are constantly enhancing our product offering and developing new      products that are designed to meet the needs of our customers today and in      the future.  
>  
>\*Scale:   Carbon fiber is a capital intensive business with long lead times. Our scale and global redundancy of manufacturing is an advantage when bidding  on contracts and further prevents new entrants.  
>  
>These barriers to entry help to illustrate how aerospace-qualified carbon fiber is not a commodity product nor do we expect it to become commoditized.

t3_gaitis,Why exactly are 0% interest rates bad?,"So as everyone is aware there is a massive debate raging on in the financial world, there's massive stimulus coming outta every central bank in the world, interest rates are either at zero, close to zero, or even negative. All of this has resulted in a huge rally in asset prices, and a calming of financial markets. 


At the same time, there's a big group of people who are highly skeptical of all of this, they say the FED is doing the wrong thing, all of this will blow up in our face and result in big consequences later on. Obviously deficits and debt is exploding. 


So why exactly is there this group of people saying all of this is bad? Japan's been at 0% interest rates for 30 years and while their stock market has obviously lagged, Japan is a healthy stable nation. Europe has been aggressive in this aswell without anything blowing up. 

Now the United States, worlds biggest economy, reserve currency of the world etc. is doing a similar thing, in what way will this blow back on us?

From [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273057/value-of-the-most-valuable-fast-food-brands-worldwide/)

Domino’s Pizza had their [quarterly report](https://ir.dominos.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dominos-pizzar-announces-first-quarter-2020-financial-results?field_nir_news_date_value%5Bmin%5D=2020) already, it was last week, which gives us the perfect amount of time to let the earnings cool off and have a slice of the data ourselves.

Before we dive into the facts and figures. I found some interesting facts while doing some research into Domino’s Pizza, and there don’t fit anywhere else. Here are some interesting facts for you to munch on.

* Domino’s stores across the globe sell an average of **3 million pizzas a day.**
* Domino’s operates **17,000 stores in more than 90 countries** around the world (Q1 2020).
* Domino’s estimates that it has **more than 350,000 franchised and corporate team members worldwide** .
* **More than half of Domino’s sales now come from outside the U.S.** (2019 global retail sales: $14.3 billion of which, $7 domestic, $7.3 international).
* Domino’s International has experienced **105 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth** (Q1 2020).
* In the U.S., Domino’s generates more than **65% of sales via digital ordering channels.**

Interesting to see their strength digitally, but also their success overseas outside their dominate home market. But let’s look at the historic share price.

From [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB828GB828&biw=1536&bih=754&tbm=fin&ei=KcWqXuj3G4eO1fAPit6b4Ag&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNzKtyygwseAA_4HIwOgAAAA&q=NYSE%3A+DPZ&oq=dominos&gs_l=finance-immersive.1.0.81l3.1180.12026.0.14228.28.17.11.0.0.0.82.1072.17.17.0....0...1.1.64.finance-immersive..0.24.971....0.-tfsrWr4glk#scso=_QcWqXr7kN7-T1fAPucGW2AE1:0)

What should be catching your eye is that aggressive jump up in Feb. This is when they announced their fourth-quarter earnings for 2019, and beat expectations! They also increased their dividend by 20% off the back of higher profits.

How is Domino’s Pizza expanding so quickly and so successfully? The franchise approach gives them a way to expand their stores with very low upfront costs (the franchise owner pays and also has to source the location) and they take a cut of the revenue as well. How much they take is tricky to find. A lot of franchises do try and hide the figures, and often only the “book cost” percentages are known.

Let’s talk about running a Domino’s Pizza store. Firstly, if you apply to open one of their stores it is likely you will be turned down.

>Over 90% of its franchise owners come from being a Domino’s team member first and that “opportunities for external candidates are very limited and are sought only when \[the company does\] not have an existing franchisee or new internal franchisee who can buy or build the stores in need.”From [Franchise Direct](https://www.franchisedirect.com/information/how-much-does-it-cost-to-open-a-dominos)

Assuming you worked at a Domino’s and wanted to open your own, you would need roughly £200k of dough. In return, you would expect to make [8-9% of total sales as take-home profit](https://franchiseguidehq.co.uk/dominos-pizza-franchise/). £90k as profit for a store owner per year for the bigger stores.

Keep in mind this includes “contributions” towards Domino’s pizza for branding and marketing. Each store is created with either a ten or five-year contract, meaning they aren’t going away anytime soon. Considering most stores will pay off the upfront costs and be paying profits to the owner within that time frame, it’s likely they will renew.

Now we can check out a snapshot of the company and see where its strengths and weakness are as an investment.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z5ezw5i6syv41.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=56733a6edfbd7bc3f7e00d1a03a389252e425263

From [Genuine Impact](https://www.genuineimpact.io/)

This is a classic, high quality, high momentum stock. You have strong financials, there is a lot of a promise for the future, and even with the spike in share price, not massively overpriced compared to the market.

We’ll start with the financial aspects, the quality. The profitability of Domino’s Pizza is not as high as you’d expect. Relative to the rest of the market this isn’t a high-profit business. What is improving the quality rank then? It’s the financial strength and capital allocation. High dividend pays out and low debt makes this a very resilient company.

Speaking of debt, let’s get the figures out of the last report.

* **$200.8 million of unrestricted cash** and cash equivalents;
* **$4.10 billion in total debt** ; and
* **$158.6 million of available borrowings** under its $200.0 million variable funding note facility, net of letters of credit issued of $41.4 million. As previously disclosed, **subsequent to the first quarter, the Company borrowed $158.0 million** under its variable funding note facility.

$4.1 billion of debt sounds a scary number, why are they considered a low debt company? The net income for Q1 was $121.6 million and growing. The debt isn’t being called up any time soon. It does restrict their ability to take on additional debt, but the high incoming and reliable revenue (long term contracts on each franchise) and physical assets (franchises borrowing equipment from Domino’s Pizza directly) means there are a lot of reassurances for anyone lending to Domino’s Pizza.

I didn’t have much to add on the value but then I did some extra digging. Price to income and cash flow Domino’s Pizza are considered overpriced and expensive.

However, if you look at the price to book ratio for the current financial year and previous two, Domino’s Pizza has almost the cheapest valuation out there, #72 out of 5,500 stocks. This is only one metric, by and large, this is an expensive stock to pick up.

As we shift our focus to the momentum, I wanted to highlight the future share price versus future growth estimates. The expected returns analyses the expected share price increase looking ahead 12 months. The expected growth is looking at revenue and EPS growth. A high dividend will drag on the share price but the future growth of the company looks very promising.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/97s6svn8syv41.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3896880ea84bf10749aa105be60e21937e70aec3

The momentum is high, with a lot of analysts flagging this investment as a buy. They have extremely strong future revenue and earnings growth, which is fueling the high confidence.

So what could possibly be the downside?

>As of April 21, 2020, nearly all of the Company’s U.S. stores remain open, with dining rooms closed and stores deploying contactless delivery and carryout solutions. Based on information reported to the Company by its master franchisees, the Company estimates that as of April 21, 2020, there are approximately 1,750 international stores that are temporarily closed.  
>  
>**Company Withdraws Two- to Three-Year Outlook**Due to the current uncertainty surrounding the global economy and the Company’s business operations considering COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its two-to three-year outlook for global retail sales growth, U.S. same store sales growth, international same store sales growth and global net unit growth.

They are throwing up the stop signs and preparing to underperform as the pandemic carries on. This seems a sensible move given the future is hard to predict and plan for right now.

This level headed approach has only added to the confidence in management to delivery.

A strong brand and franchise setup, good cash flow to keep them safe, high future growth prospects, a growing dividend, and damn tasty pizza.

Have I missed something? What is your assessment of Domino's?

**Notes To The Book “Margin Of Safety”**

**Author: Seth Klarman**

**1991**

**Prepared by: Ronald R. Redfield, CPA, PFS**

According to [www.wikipedia.com](https://www.wikipedia.com) ""Margin of Safety – Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor"" is a name of a book written by Seth A. Klarman, a successful value investor and President of the Baupost Group, an investment firm in Boston. This book is no longer published and sometimes can be found on eBay for more than $1000 (some consider it a collectible item). These notes are hardly all encompassing. These are notes I would find helpful for me, as a money manager. I do not mention Klarman’s important premise of looking at investments as “fractional ownerships.” I don’t mention things like that in these notes, as I am already tuned into those concepts, and do not need a reminder. Hence a reader of these notes, should read the book on their own, and get their own information from it. I found this book at several libraries. One awsome library I went to was the New York Public Library for Science, Business and Industry.  [http://www.nypl.org/research/sibl/index.html](http://www.nypl.org/research/sibl/index.html)

Throughout this paper you will see items in “quote marks.” The quotes exclusively represent direct quotes of Seth Klarman, from the book.  As I read this book, and through completion, I felt fortunate that I have been following most of his philosophies for many years. I am not comparing myself to Klarman, not at all. How could I ever compare myself to the greats of Klarman, Buffett, Whitman etal? 

What I did experience via this reading was a confirmation of my style and discipline. This book really put together and confirmed to me, so many of the philosophies and methods which I have been using for many years. These notes are a means for me to look back, and feel my roots every so often. At times in these notes, I have added sections which I have found appropriate in my workings.

**Introduction**

“This book alone will not turn anyone into a successful value investor.

Value investing requires a great deal of hard work, unusually strict discipline

and a long-term investment horizon.”

“This book is a blueprint that, if carefully followed, offers a good possibility

of investment successes with limited risk.”

Understand why things work. Memorizing formulas give the appearance of

competence. Klarman describes the book as one about “thinking about

investing.”

I interpret much of the introduction of the book, as to not actively buy and

sell investments, but to demonstrate an “ability to make long-term

investment decisions based on business fundamentals.” As I completed the

book, I realize that Klarman does not embrace the long term approach in the

same fashion I do. Yet, the key is to always determine if value still exists.

Value is factored in with tax costs and other costs.

Fight the crowd. I think what Klarman is saying is that it is warm and fuzzy

in the middle of crowds. You do not need to be warm and fuzzy with

investing.

Stay unemotional in business and investing!

Study the behavior of investors and speculators. Their actions “often

inadvertently result in the creation of opportunities for value investors.”

“The most beneficial time to be a value investor is when the market is

falling.” “Value investors invest with a margin of safety that protects from

large losses in declining markets.” I have only begun the book, but am 

curious as to how any value investor could have stayed out of the way of

1973 –1974 bear market. Some would argue that Buffett exited the business

during this period. Yet, it is my understanding, and I could be wrong, that

Berkshire shares took a big drop in that period. Also, Buffett referred his

investors who were leaving the partnership to Sequoia Fund. Sequoia Fund

is a long term value investment mutual fund. They also had a horrendous

time during the 1973 –1974 massacre.

“Mark Twain said that there are two times in a man’s life when he should

not speculate: when he can’t afford it and when he can.”

“Investors in a stock expect to profit in at least one of three possible ways:

a. From free cash flow generated by the underlying business, which

will eventually be reflected in a higher share price or distributed as

dividends.

b. From an increase in the multiple that investors are willing to pay

for the underlying business as reflected in a higher share price.

c. Or by narrowing of the gap between share price and underlying

business value.”

“Speculators are obsessed with predicting – guessing the direction of

prices.”

“Value investors pay attention to financial reality in making their investment

decisions.”

He discusses what could happen if investors lost favor with liquid treasuries,

and if indeed they became illiquid. All investors could run for the door at

once.

“Investing is serious business, not entertainment.”

Understand the difference between an investment and a collectible. An

investment is one, which will eventually be able to produce cash flow.

“Successful investors tend to be unemotional, allowing the greed of others to

play into their hands. By having confidence in their own analysis and 

judgment, they respond to market forces not with blind emotion but with

calculated reason.”

He discusses Mr. Market. He mentions when a price of a stock declines

with no apparent reason, most investors become concerned. They worry that

there is information out there, which they are not privy to. Heck, I am going

through this now with a position that is thinly traded, and sometimes I think

I am the only purchaser out there. He describes how the investor begins to

second-guess him or herself. He mentions it is easy to panic and just sell.

He goes onto to write, “Yet, if the security were truly a bargain when it was

purchased, the rationale course of action would be to take advantage of this

even better bargain and buy more.”

Don’t confuse the company’s performance in the stock market with the real

performance of the underlying business.

“Think for yourself and don’t let the market direct you.”

“Security prices sometimes fluctuate, not based on any apparent changes in

reality, but on changes in investor perception.” This could be helpful in my

research of the 1973 – 1974 period. As I study that era, it looks as though

price earnings ratios contracted for no real apparent reason. Many think that

the price of oil and interest rates sky rocketed, but according to my research,

that was not until later in the decade.

He discusses the good and bad of Wall Street. He identifies how Wall Street

is slanted towards the bullish side. The reason being that bullishness

generates fees via offerings, 401k’s, floating of debt, etc. etc. One of the

sections is titled, “Financial Market Innovations Are Good for Wall Street

But Bad for Clients.” As I read this, I was wondering if the “pay option

mortgages,” which are being offered by many lenders, are one of these

products. These negative amortization and adjustable mortgages have been

around for 25 years. Yet, they have not proliferated the marketplace in the

past as much as they have the last several years. Lenders such as

Countrywide, GoldenWest Financial and First Federal Financial have been

using these riskier mortgages as a typical type of loan in 2005 and 2006.

“Investors must recognize that the early success of an innovation is not a

reliable indicator of its ultimate merit.” “Although the benefits are apparent

from the start, it takes longer for the problems to surface.” “What appears 

to be new and improved today may prove to be flawed or even fallacious

tomorrow.”

“The eventual market saturation of Wall Street fads coincides with a cooling

of investor enthusiasm. When a particular sector is in vogue, success is a

self-fulfilling prophecy. As buyers bid up prices, they help to justify their

original enthusiasm. When prices peak and start to decline, however, the

downward movement can also become self-fulfilling. Not only do buyers

stop buying, they actually become sellers, aggravating the oversupply

problem that marks the peak of every fad.”

He later writes about investment fads. “All market fads come to an end.”

He clarifies, “It is only fair to note that it is not easy to distinguish an

investment fad from a real business trend.”

""You probably would not choose to dine at a restaurant whose chef always

ate elsewhere. You should be no more satisfied with a money manager who

does not eat his or her own cooking."" Just to reiterate, I do eat my own

cooking, and I don’t “dine out” when it comes to investing.

“An investor’s time is required both to monitor the current holdings and to

investigate potential new investments. Since most money managers are

always looking for additional assets to manage, however, they spend

considerable time meeting with prospective clients in addition to

handholding current clientele. It is ironic that all clients, Present and

potential, would probably be financially better off if none of them spent time

with money managers, but a free-rider problem exists in that each client

feels justified in requesting periodic meetings. No single meeting places an

intolerable burden on a money manager’s time; cumulatively, however, the

hours diverted to marketing can take a toll on investment results.”

“The largest thrift owners of junk bonds – Columbia Savings and Loan,

CenTrust Savings, Imperial Savings and Loan, Lincoln Savings and Loan

and Far West Financial, were either insolvent of on the brink of insolvency

by the end of 1990. Most of these institutions had grown rapidly through

brokered deposits for the sole purpose of investing the proceeds in junk

bonds and other risky assets.” 

 I personally suspect that the same will be said of the aggressive mortgage

lenders of 2005 – 2006. I have looked back at my files of 1st quarter 1980

Value Line for a few of these companies mentioned above. Here are some

notes on one of the companies I found.

Far West Financial: Rated C++ for financial strength. In 1979 it was

selling for 5/% of book value. “The yield-cost spread is under pressure.”

“Lending is likely to decline sharply in 1980.” “Far West’s earnings are

likely to sink 30 – 35% in 1980. Reasons: The deteriorating margin between

yield on earning assets and the cost of money, less loan fee income…” Keep

in mind that the stock price rose around 400% from 1974 – 1979. From

1968 – 1972 the P/E ratio was in a range from 11 –17. From 1973 through

1979 the P/E ratio was in a range from 3.3 – 8.1. It would be interesting for

me to look at the 1990 – 1992 Value Lines of the same companies.

**A Value Investment Philosophy:**

“One of the recurrent themes of this book is that the future is unpredictable.”

“The river may overflow its banks only once or twice in a century, but you

still buy flood insurance.” “Investors must be prepared for any eventuality.”

He describes that an investor looking for a specific return over time, does

not make that goal achievable. “Targeting investment returns leads investors

to focus on potential upside rather on downside risk.” “Rather than targeting

a desired rate of return, even an eminently reasonable one, investors should

target risk.”

**Value Investing: The Importance of a Margin of Safety”**

“Value investing is the discipline of buying securities at a significant

discount from their current underlying values and holding them until more of

their value is realized. The element of the bargain is the key to the process.”

“The greatest challenge for value investors is maintaining the required

discipline. Being a value investor usually means standing apart from the

crowd, challenging conventional wisdom, and opposing the prevailing

investment winds. It can be a lonely undertaking. A value investor may

experience poor, even horrendous, performance compared with that of other

investors or the market as a whole during prolonged periods of market

overvaluation.” 

“Value investors are students of the game; they learn from every pitch, those

at which they swing and those they let pass by. They are not influenced by

the way others are performing; they are motivated only by their own results.

He discusses that value investors have “infinite patience.”

He discusses that value investors will not invest in companies that they don’t

understand. He discusses how value investors typically will not own

technology companies for this reason. Warren Buffett has stated this as the

reason as to why he does not own any technology companies. As a side

note, I do believe that at some point, Berkshire will take a sizable position in

Microsoft ($24.31 5/1/06). Klarman mentions that many also shun

commercial banks and property and casualty companies. The reasons being

that they have unanalyzable assets. Keep in mind that Berkshire Hathaway

(Warren Buffett is the majority shareholder) is basically in the property and

casualty business.

“For a value investor a pitch must not only be in the strike zone, it must be

in his “sweet spot.”” “Above all, investors must always avoid swinging at

bad pitches.”

He goes onto discuss that determining value is not a science. A competent

investor cannot have all the facts, know all the answers or all the questions,

and most investments are dependent on outcomes that cannot be foreseen.

“Value investing can work very well in an inflationary environment.” I

wonder if the inverse is true? Are we in a soon to be deflationary

environment for real estate? I think so. Sure enough he discusses

deflationary environments. He explains how deflation is “a dagger to the

heart of value investing.” He explains that it is hardly fun for any type of

investor. He explains that value investors should worry about declining

business values. Yet, here is what he said value investors should do in this

environment.”

a. “Investors can not predict when business values will rise or fall,

valuation should always be performed conservatively, giving

considerable weight to worst-case liquidation value and other

methods.”

b. Investors fearing deflation could demand a greater discount than

usual. “Probably let more pitches go by.” 

c. Deflation should give greater importance to the investment time

frame.

“A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices

sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or

extreme volatility in a complex, unpredictable and rapidly changing world.”

“The problem with intangible assets, I believe, is that they hold little or no

margin of safety.” He describes how tangible assets might have alternate

uses, hence providing a margin of safety. He does explain how Buffett

recognizes the value of intangibles.

“Investors should pay attention not only to whether but also to why current

holdings are undervalued.” He explains to remember the reason you bought

the investment, and if that no longer holds true, then sell the investment.

He tells the reader to look for catalysts, which might assist in adding value.

He looks for companies with good management and insider ownership

(“personal financial stake in the business.”)

“Diversify your holdings and hedge when it is financially attractive to do

so.”

He explains that adversity and uncertainty create opportunity.

“A market downturn is the true test of an investment philosophy.”

“Value investing is, in effect, predicated on the proposition the efficientmarket (EMT) hypothesis is frequently wrong.” He explains that market

pricing is more efficient with larger capitalization companies.

“Beware of Value Pretenders”

This means, watch out for the misuse of value investing. He explains that

these pretenders came about via the successes of Michael Price, Buffett,

Max Heine and the Sequoia Fund. He labels these people as value

chameleons, and states that they are failing to achieve a margin of safety for

their clients. He claims these investors suffered substantial losses in 1990. I

find this section difficult. For one, the book was published in 1991, 

certainly not a long enough time to comment on investments of 1990. Also,

he doesn’t mention the broad based declines of 1973 – 1974

“Value investing is simple to understand but difficult to implement.” “The

hard part is discipline, patience and judgment.” Wait for the fat pitch.

“At the Root of a Value Investment Philosophy”

Value investors look for absolute performance, not relative performance.

They look more long term. They are willing to hold cash reserves when no

bargains are available. Value investors focus on risk as well as returns. He

discusses that the greater the risk, does not necessarily mean the greater the

return. He feels that risk erodes returns because of losses. Price creates

return, not risk.

He defines risk as, “ both the probability and the potential of loss.” An

investor can counteract risk by diversification, hedging (when appropriate)

and invest with a margin of safety.

He eloquently discusses the following, “The trick of successful investors is

to sell when they want to, not when they have to. Investors who may need

to sell should not own marketable securities other than U.S. Treasury Bills.”

Warning, warning , warning. Eye opener next. “The most important

determinant of whether investors will incur opportunity cost is whether or

not part of their portfolios are held in cash.” “Maintaining moderate cash

balances or owning securities that periodically throw off appreciable cash is

likely to reduce the number of foregone opportunities.”

“The primary goal of value investors is to avoid losing money.” He

describes the 3 elements of a value-investment strategy.

a. A bottoms up approach, searching via fundamental analysis.

b. Absolute performance strategy.

c. Pay attention to risk. 

**“The Art of Business Valuation”**

He explains that NPV and IRR are great tools for summarizing data. He

explains they can be misleading unless the flows are contractually

determined, and when all payments are received when due. He talks about

the adage, “garbage in, garbage out.” As a side note, Milford Blonsky, CPA

during the 1970’s through the mid 1990’s, taught me that with frequency.

Klarman believes that investments have a range of values, and not a precise

value.

He discusses 3 tools of business valuation”

a. Net Present Value (NPV) analysis. “NPV is the discounted

value of all future cash flows that the business is expected to generate.

He describes the importance of avoiding market comparables, for

obvious reasons. Use this method when earnings are reasonably

predictable and a discount rate can be chosen. This is often a guessing

game. Things can go wrong, things change. Even management can’t

predict changes. “An irresolvable contradiction exists: to perform

present value analysis, you must predict the future, yet the future is

reliably predictable.” He explains that this should be dealt with using

“conservatism.”

He discusses choosing a discount rate. He states, “A discount rate is, in

effect, the rate of interest that would make man investor indifferent between

present and future dollars.” He mentions that there is no single correct

discount rate and there is no precise way to choose one. He explains that

some investors use a generic round number, like 10%. He claims it is an

easy round number, but not necessarily the best choice. He emphasizes to be

conservative when choosing the discount rate. The less the risk of the

investment, the less the time frame, the less the discount rate should be. He

explains, “Depending on the timing and magnitude of the cash flows, even

modest differences in the discount rate can have a considerable impact on

the present-value calculation.” Of course discount rates are changed by

changing interest rates. He discusses how investing when interest rates are

unusually low, could cause inflated share prices, and that one must be

careful in making long term investments. 

Klarman discusses using various DCF and NPV scenarios. He also

emphasizes one should discount earnings or cash flows as opposed to

dividends, since not all companies pay dividends. Of course, one wants to

understand the quality of the earnings and their reoccurring nature.

b. Analyze liquidation value. You need to understand what would

be an orderly liquidation versus fire sale liquidation. Klarman

quotes Graham’s “net net working capital.” Net working capital =

Current Assets – Current Liabilities. Net Net working capital =

Net Working Capital – all long-term liabilities. Keep in mind that

operating losses deplete working capital. Klarman reminds us to

look at off balance sheet liabilities, such as under-funded pension

plans.

c. Estimate the price of the company, or its subsidiaries considered

separately, as it would trade on the stock market. This method is

less reliable than the other 2 and should be used as a yardstick.

Private Market Value (PMV) does give an analyzer some rules of

thumb. When using PMV one needs to understand the garbage in,

garbage out concept, as well as the use of relevant and

conservative assumptions. One has to be wary of certain periods

of excesses when using this method. Look at historic multiples. I

am reminded of some recent research I have been working on in

regards to 1973 – 1974. Utility companies were selling for over

18X earnings, when they typically sold for much lower multiples.

I believe this was the case in 1929 as well. Klarman mentioned

television companies, which historically sold for 10X pre-tax cash

flow, but in the late 80’s were selling for 13 to 15X pre-tax cash

flow. “Investors relying on conservative historical standards of

valuation in determining PMV will benefit from a true margin of

safety, while others’ margin of safety blows with the financial

winds.” He suggests when you use PMV to determine what you

would pay for the business, not what others would pay to own

them. “At most, PMV should be used as one of several inputs in

the valuation process and not the exclusive final arbiter of value.”

I think that Klarman mentions that all tools should be used, and not to give

to great a value to any one tool or procedure of valuation. NPV has the

greatest weight in typical situations. Yet an analyst has to know when to

apply each tool, and when a specific tool might not be relevant. He 

mentions that a conglomerate when being valued might have a variety of

methods for the different business components. He suggests, “Err on the

side of conservatism.”

Klarman quotes Soros from “The Alchemy of Finance.” “Fundamental

analysis seeks to establish how underlying values are reflected in stock

prices, whereas the theory of reflexivity shows how stock prices can

influence underlying values. (Pg. 51 1987 ed)”

Klarman mentions that the theory of reflexivity makes the point that a stock

price can significantly influence the value of a business. Klarman states,

“Investors must not lose sight of this possibility.” I am reminded of Enron

when reading this. Their business fell apart because they no longer were

able to use their stock price as currency. Soon covenants were violated

because of falling stock prices. Mix that difficult ingredient with fraud, and

you have a fine recipe for disaster. How many companies today are reliant

on continual liquidity from the equity or bond markets?

He discussed a valuation from 1991 of Esco. He indicated that the “working

capital / Sales ratio” was worthwhile to look at. He included a discount rate

of 12% for first 5 years of valuation, followed by 15%. He mentioned that

these higher rates indicated “uncertainty” in themselves. He stressed that

investors should consider other valuation scenarios and not just NPV. This

was all outlined above, but it was cool to see in a real time approach. He

discussed that PMV was not useful, as there were no comparables. He

indicated that a spin-off approach was helpful, as Esco previously

purchased a competitor (Hazeltine). He mentioned that the Hazeltine

acquisition, although much smaller than Esco, showed Esco to be severely

undervalued. He indicated that liquidation value would not be useful,

because defense companies could not be easily liquidated. He did look at a

gradual liquidation, as ongoing contracts could be run to completion. He did

use Stock market valuation as a guide. He noticed that the company was

selling for a small fraction of tangible assets. He called this a very low level,

considering positive cash flow and a viable company. He couldn’t identify

the exact worth of Esco, but he could identify that it was selling for well

below intrinsic value. He looked at all worst-case scenarios, and still

couldn’t pierce the current market price. He claimed the price was based on

“disaster.” He also noticed insider purchasing in the open market. 

Klarman discussed that management could manipulate earnings, and that

one had to be wary of using earnings in valuation. He mentioned that

managements are well aware that investors price companies based on growth

rates. He hinted that one needs to look at quality of earnings, and the need

to interpret cash costs versus non-cash costs. Basically, indicating a

normalization of earnings process. “…It is important to remember that the

numbers are not an end in themselves. Rather they are a means to

understanding what is really happening in a company.”

He discusses that book value is not very useful as a valuation yardstick.

Book Value provides limited information (like earnings) to investors. It

should only be considered as one component of thorough analysis.

“The Challenge of Finding Attractive Investments”

If you see a company selling for what you consider to be a very inexpensive

price, ask yourself, “What is wrong with this company?” This reminds me

of Charles Munger, who advises investors to “invert, always invert.”

Klarman mentions, “A bargain should be inspected and re-inspected for

possible flaws.” He indicates possible flaws might be the existence of

contingent liabilities or maybe the introduction of a superior product by a

competitor. Interestingly enough, in the late 90’s, we noticed that Lucent

products were being replaced by those of the competition. We can’t blame

the entire loss of wealth on Lucent inferiority at the time, as the entire sector

followed Lucent’s wipeout at a later date. There were both industry and

company specific issues that were haunting Lucent at the time.

Klarman advises to look for industry constraints in creating investment

opportunities. He cited that institutions frowned upon arbitrage plays, and

that certain companies within an industry were punished without merit. He

mentions that many institutions cannot hold low-priced securities, and that in

itself can create opportunity. He also cites year-end tax selling, which

creates opportunities for value investors.

“Value investing by its very nature is contrarian.” He explains how value

investors are typically initially wrong, since they go against the crowd, and

the crowd is the one pushing up the stock price. He discusses how the value

investor for a period of time (and sometimes a long time at that) will likely

suffer “paper losses.” He hinted that contrarian positions could work well in 

over-valued situations, where the crowd has bid up prices. Profits can be

claimed from short positions.

He claims that no matter how extensive your research, no matter how

diligent and smart you are, the diligence has shortcomings. For one, “some

information is always elusive,” hence you need to live with incomplete

information. Knowing all the facts does not always lead to profit. He cites

the “80/20 rule.” This means that the first 80% of the research is gathered in

the first 20% of the time spent finding that research. He discusses that

business information is not always made available, and it is also

“perishable.” “High uncertainty is frequently accompanied by low prices.

By the time uncertainty is resolved, prices are likely to have risen.” He hints

that you can make decisions quicker, without all of the information, and take

advantage of the time others are looking and delving into the same

information. This extra time can cause the late and thorough investor to lose

their margin of safety.

Klarman discusses to watch what the insiders are doing. “The motivation of

company management can be a very important force in determining the

outcome of an investment.” He concludes the chapter with this quote:

“Investment research is the process of reducing large piles of information to

manageable ones, distilling the investment wheat from the chaff. There is,

needless to say, a lot of chaff and very little wheat. The research process

itself, like the factory of a manufacturing company, produces no profits. The

profits materialize later, often much later, when the undervaluation identified

during the research process is first translated into portfolio decisions and

then eventually recognized by the market.” He goes onto discuss that the

research today, will provide the fruits of tomorrow. He explains that an

investment program will not succeed if “high quality research is not

performed on a continuing basis.”

Klarman discussed investing in complex securities. His theme being, if the

security is hard to understand and time consuming, many of the analysts and

institutions will shy away from it. He identifies this as “fertile ground” for

research.

**Spin-offs**

The goal of a spin-off, according to Klarman is for the former parent

company to create greater value as a whole by spinning off businesses that 

aren’t necessarily in their strategic plans. Klarman finds opportunity

because of the complexity (see above) and the time lag of data flow. I don’t

know in 2006 if this is still the case, but Klarman mentions there is a 2 to 3

month lag of data flow to the computer databases. I have owned several

spin-offs and have ultimately sold them, as they were too small for the pie,

or just not followed by my research. As I think back, I think quite a few of

these spin-offs did fairly well. One example would be Freescale. As I look

at the Freescale chart, it looks like it went from around 18 two years ago, to

around 33 today. Ahh, this topic alone, enabled the book to provide

potential value to my future net worth.

Bankrupt Companies

Look for Net Operating Losses as a potential benefit. He describes the

beauty of investing in bankrupt companies is the complexity of the analysis.

This complexity, as described often in his book, leads to potential

opportunity, as many investors shy away from the complex analysis.

Pending a bankruptcy, costs get leaner and more focused, cash builds up and

compounds with interest. This cash buildup can simplify the process of

reorganization, because all agree on the value of cash.

Michael Price and his 3 stages of Bankruptcy:

a. Immediately after bankruptcy. This is the most uncertain stage,

but also one of the greatest opportunities. Liabilities are not

evident, there is turmoil, financial statements are late or

unavailable and the underlying business may not have stabilized.

The debtor’s securities are also in disarray. This is accompanied

by forced selling at any price.

b. The second stage is the negotiation of a reorganization plan.

Klarman mentions that by this time, many analysts have pored

over the financials and the company. Much more is known about

the debtor, uncertainty is not as acute, but certainly still exists.

Prices will reflect this available information.

c. The third stage is the finalization of the reorganization and the

debtor’s emergence from bankruptcy. He claims this stage takes 3

months to a year. Klarman mentions that this last stage most

closely resembles a risk-arbitrage investment. 

“When properly implemented, troubled-company investing may entail less

risk than traditional investing, yet offer significantly higher returns. When

badly done, the results of investing can be disastrous…” He emphasizes that

the market is illiquid and traders take advantage of unsophisticated investors.

“Caution is the order of the day for the ordinary investor.”

Klarman mentions to use the same investment valuation techniques you

would use for a solvent company. He suggests that the analyst look to see if

the companies are intentionally “uglifying” their financial statements. He

cites the example of expensing rather than capitalizing certain expenses.

The analyst needs to look at off-balance sheet arrangements. He cites

examples as real estate and over-funded pension plans.

Klarman discusses the investor should typically shy away from investing in

common stock of bankrupt companies. He mentions there is an occasional

home run, but he states, “as a rule investors should avoid the common stock

of bankrupt entities at virtually any price; the risks are great and the returns

are very uncertain.” He discusses one ploy of buying the bonds and shorting

the stock. He used an example of Bank Of New England (BNE). He

mentioned that BNE bonds were selling at 10 from 70, whereas the stockstill carried a large market capitalization.

He concludes the bankruptcy section by stressing that this type of investing

is sophisticated and highly specialized. The competition in finding these

securities is savvy, experienced and hard-nosed. When this area becomes

popular, be extra careful, as most of the money made is based on the

uneconomic behavior of investors.

Portfolio Management and Trading

“All investors must come to terms with the relentless continuity of the

investment process.”

He mentions the need for liquidity in investments. A portfolio manager can

buy a stock and subsequently find out he or she made an error, or that a

competitor has a stronger product. With that said, the portfolio manager can

typically sell that situation. If the investment was in an annuity or limited

partnership, the liquidity is pierced and the change of strategy cannot be 

economically deployed. “When investors do not demand compensation for

bearing illiquidity, they almost always come to regret it.”

He discusses that liquidity is not of great importance in managing a longterm oriented portfolio. Most portfolios should contain a balance of

liquidity, which can quickly be turned into cash. Unexpected liquidity needs

do occur. The longer the duration of illiquidity, should demand a greater

form of compensation for the liquidity sacrifice. The cost of illiquidity

should be very high. “Liquidity can be illusory.” Watch out for situations

that are liquid one day, and illiquid the next. He claims this can happen in

market panics.

“Investing is in some ways an endless process of managing liquidity.”

When a portfolio is in cash only, the risk of loss is non-existent. The same

goes for the lack of gain when fully invested in cash. Klarman mentions,

“The tension between earning a high return, on the one hand, and avoiding

risk, on the other, can run high. This is a difficult task.

“Portfolio management requires paying attention to the portfolio as a whole,

taking into account diversification, possible hedging strategies, and the

management of portfolio cash flow.” He discusses that portfolio

management is a further means of risk reduction for investors.

He suggests that, as few as ten to fifteen different holdings should be suffice

for diversification. He does mention, “My view is that an investor is better

off knowing a lot about a few investments than knowing only a little about

each of a great many holdings.” He mentions that diversification is

“potentially a Trojan horse.” “Diversification, after all, is not how many

different things you own, but how different the things you do own are in the

risks they entail.”

In regards to trading Klarman stated, “The single most crucial factor in

trading is the developing the appropriate reaction to price fluctuations.

Investors must learn to resist fear, the tendency to panic, when prices are

falling, and greed, the tendency to become overly enthusiastic when prices

are rising.

“Leverage is neither necessary nor appropriate for most investors.” 

**How do you evaluate a money manager?**

a. “Personal interviews are absolutely essential.”

b. “Do they eat their own cooking?” He feels this is the most

important question of an advisor. When an advisor does not invest

in his or her own preaching, Klarman refers to it as “eating out.”

You want the advisor to act in a “parallel” fashion to his or her

clients.

c. “Are all clients treated equally?”

d. Examine the investor’s track record during different periods of

varying amounts of assets managed. How has the advisor

performed as his or her assets have grown? If assets are shrinking,

try to examine the reason.

e. Examine the investment philosophy. Does the advisor worry

about absolute returns, about what can go wrong, or is the advisor

worried about relative performance?

f. Does advisor have constraining rules? Examples of this could be

the requirement to always be fully invested.

g. Thoroughly analyze the past investment performance. How long a

track record is there? Was it achieved in one or more market

cycles?

h. How did the clients do in falling markets?

i. Have the returns been steady over time, or have they been

volatile?

j. Was the track record from a steady pace, or just a couple of

successes?

k. Is the manager still using the same philosophy that he or she has

always used? 

l. Has the manager produced good long-term results despite having

excess cash and cash equivalents in the portfolio allocation? This

could indicate a low risk approach.

m. Were the investments in the underlying portfolio themselves

particularly risky, such as shares of highly leveraged companies?

Conversely, did the portfolio manager reduce risk via hedging,

diversification and senior securities?

n. Make sure you are personally compatible with the advisor. Make

sure you are comfortable with the investment approach.

o. After you hire the manager, monitor them on an ongoing basis.

The issues that were addressed prior to hiring should be used after

hiring.

He finishes the book with these words. “I recommend that you adopt a

value-investment philosophy and either find an investment professional with

a record of value-investment success or commit the requisite time and

attention to investing on your own.”

BBSI helps small businesses grow by allowing them to outsource a task with high administrative burden. For many small businesses, payroll and administrative tasks are a fixed costs through HR employee salaries. PEO clients are billed for a percentage of client payroll, with the gross amount invoiced including direct payroll costs, employer payroll-related taxes, workers’ compensation coverage, and a service fee. By charging a percent of wages at the client firm, they help their clients by turning their former fixed cost administrative services into variable costs based on wages. PEO revenue is reported net of direct payroll costs, such as salaries, wages, and health insurance because BBSI is not the primary obligor for these payments, their clients are. “Indirect” payroll costs, such as payroll taxes and benefits and Workers’ Compensation expenses make up the bulk of operating costs.


The key to understanding BBSI’s financial statements comes down to establishing the co-employment relationship with their clients. BBSI’s primary operating expenses are Direct Payroll costs (10% of 2019 revenue), Payroll taxes and Benefits (46%), and Workers’ Compensation (22%). These three costs are passed entirely onto clients. Direct Payroll costs are related to their staffing business, while the latter two expenses are related to PEO clients. In addition to billing these above expenses, BBSI includes a service fee that is based on the total wages of employees. Their operating income can be simplified down to the service fee less their own corporate SG&A expenses.

**Competition:**

Implementing HR and admin solutions has become a big business for big businesses, but the small business market has had less focus from large players. Paychex & Salesforce both provide tech suites aimed at larger companies and white collar firms. Barrett’s average client size is roughly 30 employees, and the focus is on blue and gray collar firms.
Focusing on small business PEO, the main competition is TriNet Group Inc (TNET) and Insperity Inc(NSP). Focusing on geographical growth is the major differentiating strategy factor that Barrett uses to succeed in the PEO market. Focusing on conversions from internal HR departments, a substitute good for PEO, they achieve more aggressive pricing while still having net client ads quarter over quarter. Since 2016, their client base has grown at roughly 13.7% per year. The strength of growing geographically using branches allows them to fully flex their network of new clients from referral partners and clients.

&nbsp;

**Why is it a good buy now?**


•	**Barrett is trading at a significant discount to their historical trading valuations, as well as at discounts relative to their PEO peers.** After Q4’19, they reduced 2020 guidance on the eve of the full COVID pandemic, leading to a cool reception from the street. Alone, this would not be enough to feel it as a discount considering the significant impact COVID will have on their business. However, they also trade at a significant discount to their PEO peers while simultaneously leading their PEO peer group in FCF yield.


Firm | EV/FCF | P/E| FCF Yield | Net Debt/EBITDA
---|---|----|----|----
Barrett Business Services Inc (BBSI) | 3.73 | 7.18 | 19.3% | N/A
TriNet Group Inc (TNET)* | 7.44 | 14.08 | 14.5% | 0.77
Insperity Inc (NSP)* | 11.65 | 13.34 | 8.5% | N/A

^*Comparisons ^are ^made ^for ^same ^periods. ^While ^TNET ^and ^NSP ^have ^reported ^Q1’20 ^earnings, ^it ^makes ^more ^sense ^to ^compare ^the ^same ^period ^for ^all ^three ^firms


•	**Barrett has a strong balance sheet consisting of a negative net debt position, giving them significant leeway in weathering the COVID pandemic storm.** Less than 10% of their TEV being made up of interest-bearing debt, they are sitting pretty when it comes to weathering this storm. At some points during the business cycle it feels silly to start financial analysis at the balance sheet, but during a recession is not one of those times. With so few financial obligations, they are expected to trim corporate SG&A and investment in their new technology platform to keep more cash within the firm. Barrett stands a high chance of making it out the other side with a low chance of bankruptcy.

•	**Focusing on growth from a geographical perspective, Barrett’s management has carved out a small business niche that has seen success in their ability to open new branches.** Focusing on small businesses (average client firm size is ~30 employees) gives them an edge over some of the larger payroll companies in the market. Clients typically find BBSI through a strong referral network of both existing clients and external referral partners. Most of BBSI’s new clients are converting from internal HR/admin staff, which allows BBSI to provide a powerful value proposition. They turn small businesses’ fixed cost employee salaries into a variable cost based on total employee wages.

•	**Quality branch economics shows a model with strong operating leverage and marginal ROIC.** New branches take roughly a 500k investment and take about 5 years to become a mature branch. To be expected, more mature branches have more billing generation and more profit margin contribution. Barrett grows new branches geographically, allowing it to maintain high concentrations in local markets, ramp up the speeds of growth, and reduce fixed costs associated with new regions. Their strategies in opening new branches culminate in an ROIC in 2019 of 30.6%. The IRR on new branches that take 7 years to reach maturity is still more than 150%. 


Branch Stratification:

Number of Branches | Size | Run Rate| Average Profit Margin
---|---|----|----
18 | Mature | >$100 Mil | ~60%
20 | Emerging | $30-$100 | ~40%
26 | Developing | <$30 | ~10%
64 | Total |  | 

&nbsp;

**Conclusion:**


Based on the underlying business model and execution of the management, BBSI seems undervalued. Based solely on their strong balance sheet and large multiple discrepancy between both themselves historically and their fellow PEO peers, they seem like a buy and hold until well after the COVID-19 Crisis has ended. Their business will have the ability to ramp up naturally as their clients begin to hire again and small businesses are looking for a way to outsource admin they may have laid off. In conjunction with their strong branch economics, BBSI is currently undervalued for investors who can take a 3+ year time horizon allowing for the business to recover and their multiple to converge with peers.
A model has not been completed as Q1’20 results have not been released, which will likely contain big indications into how BBSI will perform for the coming quarter and year. A model will be completed, and an update posted once Q1’20 data has been released. 
Q1’20 is expected to be released 5/5 after market close. In the absence of a model, I have already thoroughly investigated their past few 10-k’s and read through most of their earnings calls over the past few years. I have spent a considerable amount of time insuring I understand how their business and financials tie to one another. To feel comfortable going long this business, I felt the need to dig in and understand it from their branch economics to how their workers’ compensation claims policy works with Chubb.

 I am more than happy to discuss the company and delve deeper into the financials of the company if anyone has any questions/comments.

t3_ggj717,Isn't EBIT a better measure of true earnings power (than some cash flow metric)?,"Cash flow metrics usually do the following:

* Add back D&A and deduct capex - but why not just use D&A as maintenance capex and leave it? It's as good an approximation as  you're probably going to get for most businesses anyway.
* The D&A will usually include some portion of capital lease expense - but that's a proper expense of running the business and should be left deducted. And now that operating leases are starting to be treated the same way, their contribution to D&A should also stay deducted. Maybe the interest component of the lease should be further deducted from EBIT.
* Add back SBC as a non-cash expense - but it really is a cost and should be left deducted in opex. Economically speaking, this is more like a financing cash flow and not really to do with operations.
* Add back changes in net working capital - similar to SBC, is it really cash you can pull out of the business, or is it a form of financing which shouldn't be added back to earnings power?
* Add back one-time non-cash write-downs - but if they occur regularly, should be left deducted from true earnings power. You're just shifting the ""expense"" from one year to another. The cash went out the door at some point, even if you're only recognizing the loss later on when it happens to be non-cash. The loss should be recognized somewhere, even though non-cash.
* Add back / subtract deferred income tax - similar to non-cash write-downs, aren't you just shifting the timing of the tax liability from one year to another?

So if we're trying to approximate true earnings power or economic earnings of the total enterprise, doesn't good old EBIT do a pretty good job? Maybe do a trendline of the last 10 years of EBIT to account for whether the ""one-time"" add-backs are really non-recurring. What am I missing here?",89,0.97,1589043938.0
t3_ggbkxk,The new age of Monetary Policy: an in-depth analysis of Federal Reserve Policy in the 2008 and 2020 financial crises,"**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailed out Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

t3_gharp1,A Guide to SEC Regulation for Start-Ups and Small Corporations [OC],"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e4quu4jch0y41.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=976f7a235e7af07536d88533bc32413c9f47edfd

During the 2008 crisis Uber, Airbnb, and other unicorns were created. This is some general registration advice for the future generation of unicorns being created during this crisis.

There are several securities registration exemptions that small corporations / start-ups can use depending on which one best fits the needs of the corporation. Using a securities registration exemption can help reduce some of the legal and accounting costs compared to a typical public offering of a security. The pros and cons of the following exemptions will be discussed in detail: Regulation A+ (Tier 1 and Tier 2), Regulation D (rules 504, 506(b), and 506(c)), Regulation Crowdfunding, and Intrastate Crowdfunding (rules 147 and 147a). The main differences between the exemptions are:

* How much companies can raise under each (offering limit)
* Regulatory oversight  

   * Filing requirements
   * Disclosure requirements
* Legal and accounting costs of the offering
* Who companies can solicit their offering to and who is eligible to invest
* Whether or not state regulatory laws are preempted
* Resale of securities

Regulation A is a securities registration exemption that has two tiers. For a 12-month period, the offering limit is $20 million or less for Tier 1 and $50 million or less for Tier 2. Offering under $20 million can elect to register the securities under either Tier. Under both Tier 1 and Tier 2, the company issuing the shares (issuer) must file an offering statement on Form 1-A with the SEC. This includes offering materials, two years of financial statements and an exit report. An issuer can only accept payment for the sale of its securities once its offering statement is qualified by the staff at the SEC. This SEC qualification requirement will still result in hefty filing and legal fees. General solicitation is permitted (you can freely advertise and talk about the advertising), and there are no restrictions on the subsequent resale of the securities offering. In addition, non-accredited investors are eligible investors.

There are relatively few differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 besides the offering limits. For Tier 1 offerings, in addition to filing Form 1-A with the SEC for review and qualification, state securities regulators will likely also review and qualify required offering materials. Companies offering securities under Tier 1 do not have ongoing reporting requirements other than a final report on Form 1-Z on the status of the offering and are subject to state regulation known as “blue sky” laws. There are no investment limits under Tier 1. Unlike Tier 1, offerings made under Tier 2 have slightly more stringent reporting requirements including ongoing annual and semi-annual reports after the offering is closed. Tier 2 offerings are not subject “blue sky” laws because federal law preempts state securities regulation. Under Tier 2, non-accredited investors are subject to certain investment limits. Although securities exempted under Regulation A are far less complicated and costly than an initial public offering (IPO), this can be a lengthy and expensive process for start-ups. Regulation A is primarily used to help growth companies raise money from non-accredited investors in a “mini-IPO” style offering as a potential alternative to institutional capital.

Regulation D is another set of securities registration exemption governed by Rules 504 and 506. Offerings under Rule 504 are limited to 5 million or less within a 12-month period, and anyone can invest in the offering. Exemptions under Rule 506 have no offering limits and is also preempts state securities law. Rule 506(c) only allows accredited investors, and Rule 506(b) allows for a maximum of 35 sophisticated non-accredited investors. For Regulation D exemptions, issuers must file Form D within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering, and the resale of the securities is restricted. Under 506(b), additional information is required for sales to non-accredited investors. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D exemptions do not have to wait for qualification to accept payment. The main difference between Regulation D exemptions is that general solicitation (advertising) is allowed under Rule 506(c), only in limited circumstances under Rule 504, and not permitted under Rule 506(b). Start-ups generally prefer Regulation D for its relatively lower cost and fast turnaround.

Regulation Crowdfunding is another securities registration exemption that allows companies to raise up to $1.07 million from both accredited and non-accredited investors within a 12-month period. General solicitation of the offering is permitted with some limitations after Form C (similar to Form 1-A) has been filed which includes two years of certified financial statements. Unlike other exemptions, Regulation CF offerings must be offered solely through an online platform operated by an intermediary registered as either a broker-dealer or a registered funding portal. Regulation CF preempts state law, and the securities sold in the offering are subject to certain transfer restrictions for 12 months. Typically, Regulation CF is geared towards startups who plan to raise money entirely through the internet.

Intrastate Crowdfunding is another set of securities registration exemptions governed by Rules 147 and 147a. Intrastate CF offerings have no offering limit, but the issuer must be an in-state resident and “doing business” in-state. Only in-state residents can invest in an Intrastate CF offering. Intrastate CF offerings have no SEC filing requirements but are subject to state securities registration laws. Securities sold through Intrastate CF offerings can only be resold in-state for a 6-month period. The only difference between Rule 147 and 147a is that under 147a, issuers are allowed to be organized in a different state and are allowed to solicit offerees outside of the state. Intrastate CF is primarily for companies that operate in-state and plan for a community-based offering instead of a broad-based internet offering.

For small corporations, Regulation D Rule 506(c) seems like the best option to fulfill the companies initial goals. This recommendation is based on the following assumptions: 1. The goal is to raise $5-20 million in the initial round, 2. corporations would like to advertise on the internet including social media, 3. corporations is looking to keep the cost of the offering as low as possible, and 4. corporations wants to operate in all 50 states. Here, Regulation CF is not viable options because the offering limit is too low for corporations’s fundraising goals. Also, Regulation CF is less preferable because it requires a registered intermediary to conduct the offering. In addition, based on the last assumption, Intrastate CF is not a viable option because the company’s operations and investors are limited to one state. This leaves Regulation A and Regulation D as the remaining viable options.

Regulation D is preferable to Regulation A for several reasons. First, Regulation D is more cost-effective versus Regulation A because the offering documents do not have to be reviewed or qualified by the SEC. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D only requires the issuer to file Form D within 15 days after the sale of the security and the filing does not have to be qualified by the SEC. Furthermore, unlike Regulation A, Regulation D offerings under Rule 506 have no offering limit. As stated before, Regulation A is more geared towards growth companies while Regulation D is a better fit for start-ups. In this instance, the only benefits Regulation A has over Regulation D is that the offering is not limited to only accredited investors, and the resale of the securities is not limited.

Having narrowed down the exemptions to Regulation D, Rule 506(c) is the most preferable exemption in this situation. Unlike Rules 504 and 506(b), Rule 506(c) allows start-ups to advertise the offering without violating the exemption. Although Rule 504 does not limit the type of investors, there is an offering limit of $5 million, and state securities regulation is not preempted. Overall, Rule 506(c) is the most cost-effective exemption that allows start-ups to advertise its offering and reach its fundraising goals. The main limitations of Rule 506(c) offerings are that the investors must be accredited, and the resale of the security is restricted.

&#x200B;

Roll  ups is a management game, capital allocation and execution decisions  are made by management or management appointed advisers. One of the  behaviour patterns to look for is when management takes a good thing to  the extreme, like VRX.

Which brings me to [BYL.TO](https://byl.to/).   The last two acquisitions were bought at about 2x revenue with zero or  negative contribution to EBITDA. They are low quality cyclical  businesses. The market rewarded this behaviour with a 25% gain, like  VRX, the market is focused on the top line number ignoring quality, and [BYL.TO](https://byl.to/)  management knows it. They acquire revenue, ignore sustainable  accretion, create a synergy cost saving and growth story (5G), the  market rewards them, they raise more capital, rinse, repeat. It's a  positive feedback loop that's shown to be unsustainable and when it  comes undone the results are devastating: major acquisition write downs,  asset disposals to raise cash, litigation, etc. Their behaviour may  change in the future but short term rewards are hard to ignore.

I  would argue that Ackman and Sequoia initially saw a good idea in VRX  but swayed from core value investing when a clear pattern of bad  acquisitions started to emerge.",7,0.89,1589468154.0

**My analysis / commentary on the article**:

The trade tensions that are playing out between the United States and China, are most exacerbated in their nature within the technology industry. With COVID-19 acting as a short term dampener but long term catalyst in reigniting the trade war, as general anxiety over the pandemic has begun to subside with a recovery in sight, we're beginning to see things happening very quickly on the policy side from Washington. Given the imminent timing of election season coming up this fall, it makes sense that the current administration would have major incentives to try and create as much of an impact as they can in the given time period that they have.

As to immediate focus, semiconductors continue to be an area within technology that garners the majority of attention. The extension of banned exports for Huawei is, at least in its current state, essentially a signed death knell to the company, and is an extraordinarily direct sign of the current administration's stance. Whether it is a completely fair one is potentially up for debate. Huawei is being charged primarily for conspiracy to steal trade secrets ([https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-telecommunications-conglomerate-huawei-and-subsidiaries-charged-racketeering](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-telecommunications-conglomerate-huawei-and-subsidiaries-charged-racketeering)). This is true, but is also generally the case for the Chinese tech industry as a whole, as well as historically so for all developing countries. Ideally, the hope is that as countries become more developed though, this begins to taper off as has occurred with other countries like Japan, South Korea, etc. Historically, we have seen the need for an initial set of sanctions to solidify the consequences of continued IP theft. Take the sanctions made against Japan during the 1980s as an example. At least in this respect, the current trade war that's occurring between the US and China isn't completely novel. Huawei in this case will probably end up acting as a sacrificial figurehead.

TSMC announcing their intention to build a semiconductor fabrication facility within the United States, is likely a strategic move taken to ensure the continued stability and access of their existing export pipelines. The company manages a tricky situation in that the majority of its revenues come from exports to the US through its manufacturing contracts with companies like Apple, AMD, Nvidia, etc. while also having to contend with its much larger and closer neighbor China.

The article concludes with an argument that this is the beginning of a decoupling between the US and China. My personal take is that the reality is a bit more complicated. We live in a world that is deeply intertwined. Being dependent on each other for trade is a great factor in ensuring geopolitical and thus economic stability. Though it theoretically may be possible to successfully decouple, I doubt either of the two countries want this to actually occur as their primary goal.

I would continue to look at technology companies as a benchmark for early indication on how things will play out. Any moves made by the two countries will be most immediately and strongly felt there.",24,0.97,1589592750.0
t3_glnadr,ICANN rejects .org domain sale to private equity firm Ethos Capital,"[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/victory-icann-rejects-org-sale-private-equity-firm-ethos-capital](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/victory-icann-rejects-org-sale-private-equity-firm-ethos-capital)

The private equity firm Ethos Capital originally proposed an acquisition of the .org web domain for $1.135 billion in November of 2019. The proposal has since been taken down, but you can still view an archived version [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130015502/https://www.keypointsabout.org/blog/advancing-the-internet-societys-mission-into-the-future).

This would have been a first of its kind transaction in what was to be the sale of a purportedly publicly owned domain to a private enterprise. I can't say exactly what Ethos Capital would have done with the domain once acquired, but I can imagine quite a number of ways that they could have monetized things, none of which would have been healthy or pleasant for the greater internet ecosystem unfortunately.

Ethos Capital failed in taking over the .org domain after receiving major public backlash, but now that the idea has been let out, I wouldn't be surprised if we continue to see other activist / PE firms re-attempt similar acquisitions going into the future.",14,0.89,1589749260.0

t3_gs8vn8,I am short on Slack - Why I think the fundamentals are against them,"Hello again! I've been working on the feedback you all gave me a few weeks back and wanted to reattempt another analysis, this time on Slack. 

Slack is a company I've wanted to take a look at for a while and after the short COVID-19 related rally it's worth seeing what all the fuss has been about. With more people working at home, and with some mounting pressure from Microsoft with their Teams competitor product, what does this all mean for investors like us?

**What Does Slack Do?**

Depending who you ask, Slack has either saved your business from endless emails and made communication and transparency easy, or it's where employees waste their time and post funny pictures.

Slack is a communication tool which works on desktop, mobiles, and browser, that lets you easily share ideas, comments, and files with one another. Recently they have even added in video calls and joining different companies together to share a chat, think a business partnership where you need open communication with one another without emailing back and forward and integrating different tools.

Where Slack shines compared to competitors and similar products like Skype, Microsoft Teams, Discord, and Facebook Workspace, is the depth and ease of integration. Slack goes beyond a chat application to be fully integrated with your existing systems and processes. With a free tier and huge amounts of developer support, Slack has transformed business communication.

Originally the team behind Slack were building an online game, a business which after $15m of investment and two years didn't get anywhere. However, while building this they needed a way to community easily across their teams and to keep information accessible and transparent. Slack was originally an internally developed tool which turned out to be the real gem they had all along.

Technically Slack originally stood for Searchable Log of All Communication and Knowledge but deep down we all know that isn't true.

You can read their full story below, for now, I'll move onto how they make money.

[https://usefyi.com/slack-history/](https://usefyi.com/slack-history/)

Slack is a SaaS solution, which prices per user in a team or organisation. This means Slack needs to get into large established businesses and convert the whole company to use their system. This means ease of integration, administration, and watertight security are critical to mass adoption.

I mentioned that Slack has a free tier, this is part of their adoption strategy. A grassroots effort to get individuals and smaller businesses involved and developing plugins and using the product, hoping they expand into the paid tiers with more plugin capacity and full history.

Source: [https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/about](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/about)

In terms of pricing, Slack goes from a free limited version to paid versions ranging from $6.50 upwards per team member. This goes back to the scale aspect, you want large corporations to bring on their whole organisation.

Slack also runs an $80m fund which focuses on funding teams with a proven track record to build extensions and plugins (or whole businesses) which have Slack at their core.

[https://slack.com/developers/fund](https://slack.com/developers/fund)

**The Competition**

I don't always go super deep with companies competitors and rather look at the fundamentals to get a gauge as to how defensible the business is. In this case, and when we look at the fundamentals you'll see some of my concerns, we do have one direct competitor who is getting a lot of attention.

[https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270421/slack-ceo-stewart-butterfield-microsoft-teams-competition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270421/slack-ceo-stewart-butterfield-microsoft-teams-competition)

Microsoft Teams is a like for like competitor who use their existing Microsoft ecosystem to encourage businesses to move onto their system. Microsoft doesn't have a great track record of keeping some of its business lines alive even with heavy backing, something Microsoft and [Google both share](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

That doesn't stop this from being a thorn in Slack's side, and the biggest threat to the moat they had otherwise created. While there are many other solutions out there, few have the penetration and retention of Slack, the exception being Microsoft Teams.

An investment in Slack is going to be influenced by how much of a threat you feel Microsoft presents. I believe this is something you must seriously consider.

**What About Slack's Fundamentals?**

I mentioned I was interested in looking at Slack, having now finally had a dive into the numbers and reports, I'm shocked at how the business has been run recently.

A first pass looking at Slack relative to the rest of the market already paints a bleak picture. As such I wanted to look into each aspect in more detail to make sense of these ranks and to see if there was anything worth being mindful of.

Starting with the quality aspects, we can quickly discard anything to do with dividends as none have been paid. This leaves us to focus on profitability and how they manage their cash.

In terms of revenue, Slack brought in a respectable $630.4m last year which is growing quarter by quarter. They have also slightly diversified their income by growing their >$1m a year customers and >$100k customers. 47% of their revenue comes from the >$100k a year customers, which is made up of 893 different companies. 70 customers are in the >$1m a year bracket which is a big improvement from 39 a year ago.

Looking at the cost of revenue we can get a better understanding of how Slack is spending its money, and how efficient their business truly is. Slack has a brilliant gross margin of 84.58%, in terms of serving their reoccurring revenue that is an excellent and scalable figure to see.

If we shift slightly to the profit margin we can see -90. 58%. Somewhere something is going wrong. High expenses are happening which they claim is not involved in serving the basic needs of the existing customers.

We are focusing on the second to last columns, the full year ending 2020. $457.3k on research and development, $402.7k on sales and marketing, and $261.3k on general and admin?

The General and admin are very high considering they believe the cost of revenue is only $97.1k, it's almost three times higher. Without going through every line is too much detail, this feels unfairly high and suspicious.

The R&D and sales and marketing figures are painfully high also. 72.5% of all revenue goes towards research and development. You do not have a strong defensive moat if you are spending so aggressively to stay ahead. All it takes is for technologies to move forward or for a few missed opportunities to fall behind. Keep in mind the beast breathing down their backs is the bottomless pockets and endless R&D of Microsoft.

The sales and marketing are also aggressively high as mentioned. While they have done an excellent job of expanding their customer base, the cost per acquisition is very high. If the cost of revenue is to believed they can make back the money with the lifetime value of the customers, but how long will that take, and will they be passed in terms of technological ability before then?

Before you double-check if Slack is expecting a turn around next year, they aren't. The guidance stands at another full year 2021 $125k loss.

Looking back at the Genuine Impact relative rankings, we know the value is going to be a tough assessment also.

Technically speaking we can't do many trailing ratios as Slack has got over a year's worth of reports for us to assess. That is next month. With the data we have, we can judge the price to sales which are 28.26x, and the price to book of 25.14x. Neither inspires any confidence, as a value investor, there are a lot of red flags to be found.

A company with few assets, lots of digital IP, and expensive R&D spending to try and stay ahead. This is extremely far from a value investor's dream of unrealised potential and assets waiting to be sold.

To cheer ourselves up I will look at the momentum and future projections, which appear to be fairly bullish on the surface.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jz02qga13j151.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b820653c3df0e46914481d1075a2235d0f9fcb1

Source: [https://www.genuineimpact.io/](https://www.genuineimpact.io/)

The future projects of revenue and EPS are both extremely high, this is easily explained by the ridiculously high marketing budget, and the fact they have a negative EPS, to begin with. When you are at the bottom the only way is up, right? Unless you somehow get worse which in the world of investments, is always possible.

I was surprised at the bullish analyst outlook. The weak financials and heavy spending are not sustainable. There is a lot of insider selling, more debt being raised (49.79% debt to assets, this is due to recurring revenue commitments), and they face extremely tough competition.

Looking at the analyst ratings they are slightly better than a hold but not a strong buy either. I was extremely shocked to see the target price for many of the analysts is lower than the current price. A few analysts are out of date now and their target has been hit, while others are in a firm hold camp and forecasting weak share price growth (in some cases retraction!)

**So Why A Sell?**

I love Slack as a product. I love their vision and I have grown to depend on their solutions. They have a great ecosystem and engagement when it comes to their customers too.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v2i9eiq43j151.jpg?width=1563&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=344bba4a5c957430900b5801fb536d096849afce

They have even expanded internationally with 37% of their revenue coming from overseas now, slight currency exposures but they are still primarily as USD based firm when it comes to revenue.

But, it just doesn't add up to me as a long term investment.

The product can be replicated, and we can see dozens of new entries into the market following their best practice. We have multiple companies looking to enter (or who have) the space with bigger budgets, existing ecosystems and clients, that can play the long game.

R&D spending is too high. How many years can you get it right before you are dethroned? This seems like old school Intel. A great company but they were dependant on their R&D spending to stay ahead and ultimately ended up having to change up the business to be what they are today.

I don't believe Slack is going to crash, or it's going to disappear tomorrow. The current rally will likely continue, but I believe my capital can be better invested elsewhere for the long term. There are a lot of exciting tech companies with better long term prospects and who have a more defensible business.

As much as I love Slack as a product. It's not a long term investment for me. You might some joy in taking short term positions and following the trends, but I'd rather focus on more interesting momentum investments.

Let me know what you think of my thoughts and write up. This is my longest article yet and hopefully the most engaging.

t3_gul01l,RE: The Bull Case for Barrett (BBSI),"This is a follow up post to my previous analysis of BBSI prior to the release of their Q1’20 Earnings. As previously stated, we are living in a time of great uncertainty, which is reflected in any projections/modeling presented in this post. 

Note: All price information is as of 5/28/20. Any links are to images that will provide additional color to the section they're located in.

&nbsp;


Previous post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/gdzpl5/the_bull_case_for_barrett_bbsi/


&nbsp;



**Disclaimer:**
This is not investment or financial advice and the above thesis is predicated on my opinion & interpretation of the facts mentioned. I am currently long BBSI in my personal portfolio.


&nbsp;


**Barrett Overview**


Barrett Business Services, Inc. (BBSI) is a PEO firm offering management solutions to small business across the country. They enter co-employment contracts with their clients and manage their payroll and workers compensation claims businesses, saving them money and saving management time. Barrett utilizes a professional referral network that they develop geographically to source new clients cheaply. Upwards of 90% of their new clients are from their professional referral network, with many of them being converted from in-house HR management teams. Barrett is often the first PEO firm that many of their clients have worked with, allowing them to not sacrifice on pricing through fierce competition with other firms. Their clients are typically small blue and gray collar business, averaging just 30 employees per client.

When looking at their financials, the first thing that seems off is their PNL appears to be a very low margin business. Operating margins in 2019 were just 5.8%, but the numbers can be deceiving. BBSI bills their clients every pay cycle, and within their billing are included some of their major expenses that show up on their own PNL. Accounting rules stipulate that even though some of the expenses, such as Payroll taxes and benefits and Workers’ compensation, are billed directly to the clients for 100% of the expense, BBSI must still show this on their own PNL with top line revenue gross of these costs. Barrett’s operating income can be boiled down to the service fee they charge less their own corporate SG&A expenses.


&nbsp;
[BBSI EBITDA and Operating Margins](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamnormal/comments/guka63/bbsi_ebitda_and_operating_margins/)

 
Working with insurance requires that Barrett hold a significant amount of cash on their balance sheet. They keep reserves of restricted cash and investments which are used to fund future workers’ compensation claims as they arise. The net debt position when only considering the unrestricted cash is still negative, showing Barrett’s strong current financial strength. Unfortunately, being in a low interest rate environment typically hurts insurers like Barrett, where investment income can make up a significant portion of net income. Their average yield on investments in the past has been above 2%, but with the recent market turbulence it is expected to be just 1.5% for the full year 2020. 

For the modeling done for this report, EBITDA or FCFF have been used as the cash flow figure of choice. Both metrics exclude investment income, as modeling out the values and returns of their investment portfolios would be done with too much uncertainty to have significant value.

One of the main differentiating factors for Barrett from other PEO servicers are their focus on branch strategy. Many of the other PEO firms opt to use a SaaS model, which does not require the same type of geographic footprint that a branch strategy does. They have created a strong professional referral network which allows them to source new clients from in-house HR systems more cheaply than having to lure clients away from other PEO servicers. Barrett can then utilize more aggressive pricing practices as their retention stays high and most of their clients have never used a PEO firm before.

While this would indicate a negative effect on client attrition, they have quarterly net new clients going back over 5 years running. Pricing can be one of the main factors that client’s site when they leave Barrett, but their retention rate remains above 97%.
By keeping branch growth in geographic locations with an existing referral network they can leverage business connections with each new branch opening. Barrett currently has 57 branches open, and sees branches mature to profit margins in the ~60% range after roughly 5 years. This type of growth with the small investment it requires to get a branch started creates impressive operating leverage down the stretch. The branch model has another attribute, in that it focuses on small businesses. Relative to some of the other major PEO firms, Barrett’s average client size is on the small side at just 30 employees per client. 


&nbsp;


**Branch Stratification:**

Number of Branches | Size | Run Rate| Average Profit Margin
---|---|----|----
18 | Mature | >$100 Mil | ~60%
20 | Emerging | $30-$100 | ~40%
19 | Developing | <$30 | ~10%
57 | Total |  | 




&nbsp;


**PEO Industry**

While the PEO industry has a couple major players with significant market shares (ADP and PAYX), the overall market is quite fragmented. The entire PEO industry serves roughly 4 million employees in the country, with about 35-40 million estimated to have use for a PEO plan. This leads to significant market fragmentation with the substitute good for PEO services (in-house HR and insurance) as one of the largest holders of market share. Firms like ADP and PAYX are mostly non-PEO services, but they still compete directly in the same markets. Typically, clients will use all of a single servicers’ offerings. For example, rather than using ADP’s Payroll services and Barrett’s PEO services, firms will typically opt to use a single servicer for all related functions.

The high degree of market fragmentation has not significantly hurt the retention rates of PEO firms, often averaging above 95%. Switching costs are apparent even in systems like these, which companies can be weary of changing due to the time it takes to learn new services and programs. The stickiness of customers alone is not enough for most firms to have any level of sustainable competitive advantage, however ADP and PAYX have been able to achieve some level of economies of scale through their sheer size. Spreading out their fixed cost investments across a higher number of Worksite Employees/Sales allows them to generally outperform their peers, explaining their much larger multiples relative to the rest of the peer group.

The PNL of firms that are predominantly PEO can be tricky as their revenues include costs that are directly billed to their clients under their co-employment arrangement. The main financial outcomes of the industry are low capital investments and high cash returns on those investments. Insurance is a cash heavy business, leading to significant levels of excess cash on all of their balance sheets, lowering their overall capital investment. Relative to income metrics such as EBIT, EBITDA, and FCFF, the return on invested capital metrics generally look very strong. 


Firm | EV/FCF | P/E| FCF Yield | Net Debt/EBITDA | ROIC

Barrett Business Services Inc (BBSI) | 4.69 | 8.3 | 17.7% | N/A | 30.6%
TriNet Group Inc (TNET)* | 8.55 | 15.69 | 12.5% | 0.77 | 35.4%

Paychex Inc (PAYX) | 22.27 | 23.57 | 4.5% | .08 | 49.4%

With the current COVID pandemic, the labor market shock has been significant and hit PEO firms particularly hard. PEO’s charge a service fee based on the amount of wages billed for. A decrease in workers or a decrease in wages would lead to lower revenues for the industry. Such a strong tie to labor market health will inevitably see their valuations hurt as they see revenues and profits fall for the whole year 2020. A slower recovery will also lead to these effects bleeding into 2021. With such low multiples relative to historical averages, the industry poses some opportunities for investors with a longer time horizon who will hold through the recovery.

**Thesis for Barrett**
	
I laid out my thesis in my previous post, and after an additional month of research it has been cemented. One additional point as been added to my original thesis. My thesis points have been recreated below. 

•	**Barrett is trading at a significant discount to their historical trading valuations, as well as at discounts relative to their PEO peers.** After Q4’19, they reduced 2020 guidance on the eve of the full COVID pandemic, leading to a cool reception from the street. Alone, this would not be enough to feel it as a discount considering the significant impact COVID will have on their business. However, they also trade at a significant discount to their PEO peers while simultaneously leading their PEO peer group along metrics such as FCF yield and EV/EBITDA. They currently trade 2.1 standard deviations below their 3-year average EV/EBITDA ratio, a greater discount than any of their peers in PEO peer group.

•	**Barrett has a strong balance sheet consisting of a negative net debt position, giving them significant leeway in weathering the COVID pandemic storm.** Less than 10% of their TEV being made up of interest-bearing debt, they are sitting pretty when it comes to weathering this storm. At some points during the business cycle it feels silly to start financial analysis at the balance sheet, but during a recession is not one of those times. With so few financial obligations, they are expected to trim corporate SG&A and investment in their new technology platform to keep more cash within the firm. Barrett stands a high chance of making it out the other side with a low chance of bankruptcy.

•	**The PEO industry is currently trading at a discount to mid-business cycle values, leading to investors with a longer time horizon an attractive return potential.** Barrett is not the only PEO firm trading at a significant discount to their historical values. The entire PEO industry is being hit hard by this pandemic, but it creates an attractive bet as the industry takes advantage of the fall in unemployment. Across the major PEO players, April was viewed as the low point in employment data, leading to a rough Q2’20, but strong financials in the quarters following. 

•	**Focusing on growth from a geographical perspective, Barrett’s management has carved out a small business niche that has seen success in their ability to open new branches.** Focusing on small businesses (average client firm size is ~30 employees) gives them an edge over some of the larger payroll companies in the market. Clients typically find BBSI through a strong referral network of both existing clients and external referral partners. Most of BBSI’s new clients are converting from internal HR/admin staff, which allows BBSI to provide a powerful value proposition. They turn small businesses’ fixed cost employee salaries into a variable cost based on total employee wages.

•	**Quality branch economics shows a model with strong operating leverage and marginal ROIC.** New branches take roughly a 500k investment and take about 5 years to become a mature branch. To be expected, more mature branches have more billing generation and more profit margin contribution. Barrett grows new branches geographically, allowing it to maintain high concentrations in local markets, ramp up the speeds of growth, and reduce fixed costs associated with new regions. Their strategies in opening new branches culminate in an ROIC in 2019 of 30.6%. The IRR on new branches that take 7 years to reach maturity is still more than 150%. 


&nbsp;

**Base Case Model**

Management had conviction that April was the bottom of their gross billing cycle based on the entire month of April’s billing and the first week of May’s. This view was further supported by other PEO management teams indicating April as their bottom. My model includes all of the cost savings metrics announced thus far in the Q1’20 earnings call and includes projections they made for full year 2020 as well as projecting April as the low point. Management has projected that even in their most pessimistic scenarios that they will see positive net income in 2020. I have 2020 sales projected to be 11% below 2019, with a full year EBIT margin of 0.3%. Overall, my projections for 2020 are more conservative than the average of the 3 coverage analysts following BBSI.

2021 follows many of the similar patterns set in 2020, with a slow recovery to get back to normal. While sales growth looks big, the 2021 sales I have projected are still less than 2019 by 1.4%. Margins are beginning to normalize, but without the same scale and deferred branch openings, the operating margins will not fully come back until 2024. I view this assumption as conservative as their new technology platform should see increases SG&A efficiency once it is fully implemented as soon as Q3’20. 

The model ends by applying a multiple to terminal value based on their historical trading multiples as well as multiples from their small cap PEO peer group. While currently in the trough of their business cycle, BBSI will see multiple expansion as PEO becomes a higher demand service during and after the recovery. My time horizon on this investment is in the 3-5-year range as this will give enough time for the recovery efforts to take place allowing for proper multiple expansion towards their mid-business cycle levels. 

Rather than depending on an individual point estimate of BBSI’s intrinsic value, I have decided to provide a two-way data table based on forward 5-year growth rates and ending multiples. The cross in the table corresponds to multiples not expanding and trailing 5-year revenue growth being applied to my model. While I believe this is generally conservative, it still provides a 58% upside over current prices. Seeing that we are in the trough of the PEO business cycle, I do expect multiples to expand from their current lows, leading to the base case having significantly more upside than the above PT implies. Overall, this provides BBSI with a strong upside opportunity for those who have the time horizon to take advantage.

[Base Case Data Table](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamnormal/comments/gukar8/base_case_data_tables_bbsi/)

The core of any DCF performed during this crisis is that there is too much uncertainty to truly know what any stock should be “valued” at. I certainly do not know how the recovery will look, and it could vary greatly from the way I have laid it out in my current model. Rather than providing a point estimate of intrinsic value, I will provide two-way data tables showing ending multiples and forward 5-year growth rates. If you believe some of my assumptions are either too verbose or too conservative, the data table should provide you with enough of an idea of what other outcomes could look like.
 


&nbsp;


**Bear Case**

I have provided a bear case model as well, predicting slower growth rates coming out of recovery, as well as slower margin expansion across the entire 5-year period. This would imply a more structural shift away from small businesses that would be significant enough to harm the future of Barrett’s new business even beyond the COVID pandemic itself. Revenue would not surpass 2019 levels until Q4’22, and EBITDA would not get back to pre COVID levels within the 5-year projection horizon. 

With the shift away from branches as a source of unit economics, Barrett’s margins will be lower and take longer than my forecast period to return to pre-COVID levels. The 2020E financials would be worse than management predicts in their pessimistic scenarios, predicting negative income for 2020, which management has said would not occur even in their worst situations. I believe the probability of the base case is much higher than the bear case, but felt it was worth including to help frame some of the modeling assumptions I had to make in my base case model. 


&nbsp;



Assumption | Base Case | Bear Case
---|---|----
2020E EBITDA (thousands) | $8,678 | $(2,898)
2020E Operating Margin | 0.2% | -1.3%
2024E Operating Margin | 5.8% | 3.7%
5-year Forward Compounded Annual Revenue Growth | 3.48% | 2.49%

**Why does this opportunity exist?**

There are 3 primary reasons why this opportunity exists for us as investors, but only time will tell how long it will last before the margin of safety shrinks too much. BBSI has risen 16% since my original write up on 5/6, slowly eroding the long-term margin of safety this investment has.

•	**The COVID pandemic has caused a major disruption in labor markets across the world, including the US.** With unemployment skyrocketing to nearly 20%, the PEO firms will see significant hits in their billing due to fewer workers and fewer hours worked. The combination of these two factors will lead to decreased revenues, which has also kept the stock prices low.

•	**An unemployment shock is the trough of the business cycle for the PEO industry.** With sales declining as the base case expectation, they face headwinds in the short term, but tail winds in the longer term. The recovery will see the firms begin to build their businesses again as unemployment falls and the economy opens more. More services will be in demand, such as staffing, allowing some of the ancillary offerings to provide additional revenue support. 

•	**Many investors do not have the time horizon to buy at this point, as there is significant uncertainty regarding when the trough would end.** The shape of the recovery and the length of this period are heavy factors in the ability for investors to see BBSI as an advantageous long position. 

•	**This is a small cap company with little analyst coverage.** Trading at below $500mil market cap since February has knocked many investors off the trail of this company as it is below their mandates. There are typically only 3-4 analysts asking questions on each call, with only 3 sell side analysts publishing opinions.

t3_gvy8zi,Is Stan Druckenmiller wrong? Why did he say in May that liquidity will dry up in H2 2020?,"Sorry for the provocative title. But the comment that I am referring to is from his interview with the Economic Club of New York on May 12.

I don't want to copy and paste the transcript, in case it needs to be removed by the mods, but during the interview, he essentially said that the Treasury borrowing will overwhelm Fed purchases, cancelling out any infusion of liquidity into the markets by the Fed. You can read his full comment here, instead of reading my undoubtedly shitty summary:  [https://thefelderreport.com/2020/05/27/why-brrr-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/](https://thefelderreport.com/2020/05/27/why-brrr-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/).

So I have done a rough check of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, their holdings of US Treasury securities, and the borrowing needs of the US Treasury for Q1\~Q3 2020, and he is, of course, right. US Treasury will have to borrow a trillion or two more in June, and the Fed has yet to help buy that, despite a meteoric rise in their balance sheet total. So maybe there will be an undigested new issuance of Treasuries in June that will wreck the markets.

I mean, they already have trillions sitting on their BS, what's another trillion or two? Strongarm Japan into buying a bit more, private buyers here and there... and it seems like this volume of new issuance isn't something that would overwhelm markets.

t3_gvp5tb,What do you think of my DD on DraftKings (DKNG)?,"DKNG has gained a lot the week of May 24 2020, mostly focused on May 26 (Tues) and May 28 (Thurs). Both days saw intraday spikes on sports-world news. On May 26 afternoon, a presser with Gary Bettman was announced, and on May 28, it was announced that the Premier League would return in June. Oddly, the stock did not drop at all, after Bettman’s announcement turned out to just be an expanded playoff format, and nothing about a return to the ice. The Premier League news didn’t impact other sports betting stocks either. Both events clearly imply that DKNG’ stock is hugely overpriced, but it’s being driven up just by trading. I’m not affiliated with DKNG in any way.  

The company’s lousy Q1 earnings was quite the spin job, and I was shocked to see the stock rise that day! Growth in marketing expenses can be written off as entering new states, but no growth in net revenue, despite 30% growth in gross revenue, means that the company can’t actually grow. In other words, almost all revenue was grown by offering free bets and reducing vigorish. Let’s examine revenue growth further.

I was stunned that the company led with “30% revenue growth” when, in fact, that was only at Old DKNG, which constitutes 75% of New DKNG revenue. SBTech makes up the rest and grew at only 3%, giving the public company a 23% growth rate for the quarter, not the 30% spin job.
DKNG might’ve unintentionally unveiled COVID19’s impact. At Old DKNG, they noted 60% growth through March 10th. If we assume that each day through the quarter is equal, that means the last 21 days of the quarter would have been down 70% vs Q1 ’19!!! This difference is hefty! But we know not all days are created equal in the world of sports, and Q1 included 5 NFL playoff days and the Super Bowl. If we assume NFL betting days are 3x a normal day and the Super Bowl is 3x a normal NFL day, revenue post-March 10th will drop 95%. Similarly, because SBTech’s dropped from +19% to only +3%, revenue post-COVID19 will drop at least by half.

Also examine how they pitched themselves when the merger was announced in Dec. 2019. On slide 22, DKNG compare their valuation to competitors’, trying to show that the valuation is fair, probably trying to counter DKNG’s valuation that was4x what Paddy Power paid for FanDuel 18 months earlier. Let’s ignore the “EV / 2021E Revenue – Growth Adjusted” multiple that they highlight, because it’s completely unreliable to adjust a forward looking multiple based on your own forward-looking growth projections. Instead look at EV / TTM 3/31 Revenue for those same comparisons.

At $39 per share, DKNG has a market cap over $15 billion on TTM revenue of $451 million. So their revenue multiple is 33.7x, which is too overvalued! The “High Growth Consumer Internet” category that they selected is at 8.1x and “EU Sportsbook Operators” at 3.6x. Their best competitor is Flutter, which is Paddy Power + Fanduel + Stars, and it trades at 7.8x. DKNG deserves a higher multiple than Flutter because DKNG is pure-play USA, and Flutter earns retail European revenue that isn’t high growth. But the two companies currently have the same market cap, despite FanDuel competing directly with DKNG with more market share in the fast growing business segments. Even if you are generous to DKNG and believe they should trade at a 50% premium to Flutter, DKNG’s share price ought be just $13.50.

No, this isn’t about more states allowing sports betting. Let’s examine what must happen at the state level to value DKNG’s current valuation reasonably. In their December investor presentation, DKNG estimates their sports book net revenue at $2.3B given 25% market share and 65% of the US having online betting, with a 22% allowance for promos from Gross to Net. Consider their $4.5 billion of gross revenue at 100% of the population. Let’s bump that by 30% bump for iGaming. DKNG’s current $15 billion valuation and the same 50% premium to Flutter’s revenue multiple above (11.7x), mean that DKNG need $1.28B of revenue, or $831M more than they currently have. $831M more revenue needed means 14% more of the population must legalize in the very short term. Of the big five states, CA, TX, FL, NY and PA, none will add any population, because PA is already online, NY chose retail-only and researchers and lobbyists don’t think the other three will legalize for another 5 years. The remaining 46 states, including DC, average 1.3% of the population each, meaning you need a windfall of states to add 14% of the population.

Forget nationally legalized sports betting, because no one is even pushing for that and it won’t happen. SCOTUS invalidated PASPA to remove the Federal Government’s ability to make national decisions like (dis)allowing sports betting. Sports betting will roll out throughout the US, but will slog state-by-state.

Now that DKNG’s stock has rocketed, DKNA’s management has two good strategies, like TSLA did when TSLA's stock price rocketed in Jan 2020. 

1. The first is obvious: follow-on equity offering. In going public via a reverse merger with a SPAC, DKNG barely tapped the big institutional investors. This follow-on can add cash to the balance sheet. If you watched TV in 2015, you know DKNG love to spend money on ads, at a very attractive valuation for the company. What’s the problem? New shares, or if the follow-on prices poorly, can lower the current share price.

2. The less obvious option is to buy a competitor, William Hill, that has a market cap of about $1.5B. They have a huge footprint in Europe, a market that DKNG previously tried and  failed to enter. Europe threatens DKNG’ DTC approach in the US, and Europe has the IT that powers much of the land-based casinos’ sportsbook operations in the US. DKNG could buy them with their cheap stock, or issue new equity to raise money for the acquisition. DKNG would add much revenue, can cut lots of duplicated costs, diversify across countries and sports to temper their seasonality, and replace William Hill’s outdated tech with DKNG’s better apps. The downside is that these two companies’ CEOs dislike each other.

What’s one reason the stock has risen so much since the “IPO”? Because DKNG has a teensy number of liquid shares. Remember this wasn’t an IPO at all, it was a reverse merger with a SPAC, so a much higher percentage of outstanding shares [are currently locked up]( https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gscyrs/dkng_makes_no_sense_to_me_lots_of_thoughts/fsbn3fm/) than in a typical IPO. That constraint on supply with big retail demand could boost the stock price! I’ll summarize the 3 cases for DKNG. 

1. Short term bull: Sports come back, stock (irrationally) trades up on it.
2. Short term bear: Stock price corrects to a more realistic valuation. Bulls take gains. Any of NHL, NBA, MLB announce they won’t play again in 2020. Company decides on more financial maneuvering.
3. Long term bear: Q2 or Q3 earnings disappoint. The NFL cash cow drops or NBA or NHL ‘20-’21 season gets delayed. Lockup ends in October 2020.",24,0.78,1591168604.0

t3_gyyx4a,Backtesting Greenblatt's Magic Formula,"Over the past week I've been researching various systematic equity strategies and decided to backtest Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula, discussed in The Little Book That Beats the Market.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/di0tni8yno351.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=26986813370b64376d6d530e7481d29d6322cdcd

**Result:** between 2003 and 2015, the Magic Formula strategy returned an annualised 11.4% (Sharpe ratio 0.60), versus 8.7% for the S&P500 (Sharpe ratio 0.54). This corresponds to a 3% alpha, so the Magic Formula does indeed outperform the market.

**What is the Magic Formula?**

A very brief summary is as follows (the exact procedure described in the link): rank stocks by Return on Capital (a measure of quality) and also by earnings yield (a measure of cheapness). Add the ranks to create a score that takes into account both quality and cheapness, then pick the top stocks.

In *The Little Book*, Greenblatt suggests that the Magic Formula returned an annualised 33% from 1988 to 2004 compared to 14% for the S&P500. My investigation shows that while there is some outperformance on a risk-adjusted basis, it is nowhere near as much as Greenblatt suggests. I think this is due to the arbitraging force of systematic equity ETFs as well as a possible regime shift post-2008.

**Other insights from the backtest**

* The Greenblatt score is indeed correlated with higher future returns (adjusting for survivorship bias). The quantile plot below shows the mean return for different quantiles of the combined ranking score:

https://preview.redd.it/hlaw7e9ypo351.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=529b0b6892aa1bb8447a0e5f1bf70ea7ed3a3413

* Pre-2008, the annualised return was 26% vs 18% for the benchmark, consistent with Greenblatt's results. However, after 2008 the outperformance shrinks drastically.
* The Magic Formula experienced deeper drawdowns than the SPY and is more volatile overall (but this is more than adequately compensated for by return, as seen in the higher Sharpe ratio).

**About the backtest**

I built the backtest in python on the Quantopian platform. I first analysed the predictive power of the Greenblatt score and since the results were good, moved on to construct a proper backtest that includes transaction costs and follows Greenblatt's accumulation procedure. The only reality not captured by the backtest is tax optimisation.

**More information**

I have written a [blog post](https://reasonabledeviations.com/2020/06/08/greenblatt-magic-formula/) containing more information, including potential modifications if you wanted to use it for personal investing. The full backtest report is on [GitHub](https://github.com/robertmartin8/RandomWalks/tree/master/GreenblattMagicFormula)  – you can download the html and open it with any browser.

Always happy to hear any feedback, questions or criticism!  


**EDIT:** backtest up until June 2019 as requested by u/flyingflail (can't go any further due to data limitations). It turns out that the 2015-2019 time period is *terrible* for the strategy.  Significantly underperforms the market. A good reminder that past performance is not indicative of future results!

t3_h132ea,Carrier - Spinoff,"Recent spinoffs may present interesting opportunities during a market downturn, as these companies can fall due to simple neglect. 

One that caught my eye is Carrier. They were spun-off in April 2020. I'm sure many of you recognize the name. The company has somewhere between 10-20% market share of the U.S. HVAC market and it is either 1st or 2nd in market share (both residential and light commercial). Their investor presentation claims that they are the #1 competitor in commercial refrigeration (such as you might see in a grocery store) and refrigeration transport. It also claims that they are either #1 or #2 in the market for residential and commercial fire detection / alarm and security systems. 

The market price for their equity is $18.5 B. Their S-1 filing shows net income of about $1.5 B to $2.5 B from 2015-2019, meaning a P/E of between 7.5 to 12.5. Over the period, they earned roughly a 10% return on assets. Service / after-market is about 1/3 of their revenues.

MEANWHILE, the $10 B of bonds that they issued earlier this year are yielding between 1%-4%, which is pretty amazing for the corporate bond market. One of these bonds goes out to 2040 and another goes out to 2050. All are rated Baa3 by Moody's (equivalent to BBB- for S&P), so it is just barely considered to be ""investment"" grade. 

Pretty big gap between the apparent yield on equity and the yield on their bonds. 

On this superficial level, it looks like a good deal.

But their Q1 2020 results were pretty bad. $0.1 B for the quarter, 1/4 as good as Q1 2019. Caused primarily by lower product sales. They blame this on COVID-19. But I wonder to what extent their former parent company pumped up 2019 numbers in preparation for the spin-off. Their Q1 2020 presentation provides guidance for $1.7 B to $2.0 B of ""adjusted operating profit"" and >$1 B of free cash flow for FY 2020. Pretty speculative of them to even make a forecast on this, given how badly COVID rocked their Q1, and it being known at the time that they made the presentation that Q2 will probably be even worse. 

Their investor presentation mentions ""China expansion"" as a growth initiative, which makes me worried, but their overall theme seems to be that they are primarily focused on the nuts-and-bolts of their business.

But, this company has been around forever and HVACs are obviously needed, regardless of where we are in the economic cycle. Same is true for refrigeration and fire detection systems... though new product sales (2/3 of their revenue) is to a heavy extent driven by the homebuilding cycle. Perhaps the P/E is 15x earnings at the low point of the business cycle and 10x earnings at the high point of the business cycle. Is that expensive for a long-time market leader?

Thoughts? Would love to hear the perspective of someone who is deep into this industry.

t3_h7arp5,Are Banks Commodity Businesses?,"Is retail banking a commodity business? I've been thinking lately about competitive advantage in banking, and they don't seem to be very durable? Anyone have any thoughts on this? I made a quick list: 

**Intangibles**

* **External Brand + Reputation**: Basically trust and confidence in brand as a ""safe place"" for depositors to take mortgages, put their deposits, etc.
* **Excellent Credit Underwriting (+ Internal Culture):** Internal culture that focuses on the long-term (i.e. superior underrating through cycles that results in low charge-offs during down markets). Also, being selective of type of clients to take on for private wealth. 

**Tangibles**

* **Lowest Cost of Capital:** Deposit base
* **Lowest Non-Interest Expenses:** Superior cost management 
* **Lowest Cost of User Acquisition:** Proprietary advantage of customer acquisition either through word-of-mouth or some capital-light model that drives asset growth
* **High Operating Leverage:** Spreading  fixed cost base across a wide addressable market (think how regional banks are disadvantaged against JP's retail banking tech footprint) 

**External**

* **#1 in Market:** Ability to dominate regional market either through history / time in market or regulatory hurdles (i.e. limited banking licenses available)  But, asset risk is high especially if secured underwriting is concentrated in one region? (i.e. natural disasters, etc.)  
* **Regulatory:** The lower the reserve requirement ratio the central bank demands, the higher the ROE.
* **Societal Outlook:** If a society doesn't have a full fleshed out safety net, then savings rates of population are higher, driving deposit growth.",6,0.8,1591923554.0
t3_h84xbi,AAPL the compounder,"I was taking a closer look at AAPL, the $1.4 trillion market cap behemoth.

The business definitely qualifies as one with a wide moat as it consistently generates high ROIC and impressive margins. 

NOPAT and FCF growth has been consistent too, at around 5% CAGR in the last five years. 

The wide moat gives us confidence that AAPL is very likely to be able to generate this same CAGR in earnings going forward for the next decade.

However, buying it at 25x earnings today and exiting at the same 25x merely gives 5% CAGR. 

A consistent 5% CAGR over a decade is not shabby but not exciting and could be below the cost of capital for some investors. 

Am I missing something? Should we expect AAPL’s earnings to accelerate (and therefore perhaps have higher exit multiple too)? Or am I under-estimating the compounding rate of AAPL such that attributing 5% is too low?

In comparison, Berkshire bought into the company around 2016. Back then, Apple was compounding NOPAT and FCF at a similar 5% CAGR, with equally high ROIC. However, the PE was much lower at around 10 - 15x. 

I welcome some thoughts. Stay well and have a good weekend!",35,0.85,1592043441.0
t3_had5ls,Verizon Analysis,"Hey everyone! I have been a lurker of the sub for a while. I just graduated (3 days ago from writing this post) from university with a degree in finance and I focused on classes where we analyzing companies as I find it very intriguing and I have actually found fun. This last quarter I took an equity analysis class and was pretty limited in what I was allowed to analyze, no FI's, or any equity analyzed in the last 4 years by another student. I ended up choosing Verizon as I thought it would be a start on learning and practicing. Here is my analysis and my hope is if any professionals out there would be willing to go through and give their input, advice, and be a critic on how to improve on my future analysis.

Some formatting may look funky as this was originally in a word doc that didn't exactly transfer over well.

Also I was forced to delete some tables and graphs due to the 20 picture upload limit, specifically I deleted MV of Debt calculations, some tables in the appendix representing WACC and cost of Equity, industry average statistics, which can be googled, my calculation of FCFE, as well as a few other minor tables, if the text refers to a table that isn't there that would be why, and I can provide to anyone upon request.

Thanks to anyone taking the time. I greatly appreciate it.

**Verizon**

6/16/2020

 Ticker: VZ 

Recommendation: **HOLD**

Price: $56.92  Price Target: $64.42

**Highlights**

· In the beginning of a 5g upgrade cycle, a significant opportunity to be a growth driver in the North American wireless market for Verizon.

· Verizon’s profit margin is at 14.61%, double compared to their competitors

· Stock market fluctuations low relative to the general market, a beta of .7, and a safe industry that many consumers deem as essential, relatively “recession proof”

· A dividend yield of 4.5% 

**Investment Summary**

**Dividend Growth**: The company is in its mature stage cycle with an established industry and market presence. Verizon has stable revenues with limited opportunity for growth outside of an acquisition of a smaller mobile carrier. This allows us to value Verizon mostly from its’ dividend growth. Historically, Verizon has a growth rate of 2.6% in the last 10 years, in the last 5, they have a historical growth rate of 5%. A growth rate of 3.5% is estimated to be Verizon’s growth rate moving forward. Fortunately, the industry business model allows for constant cash flow and sustainability in the mature stage cycle.

**Expansion:** 5g is the one of the few areas for growth still available to Verizon, 5g refers to the next generation in wireless data transfer technology. This new technology will increase data transfer rates by up to 100-fold. The last technological advancement with 4g impacted Verizon by increasing revenues by up to 5% one year and averaged revenue growth 4.3% annually for 4 years. This effectively doubled Verizon’s revenue growth average of 2.3% annually. Outside of 5g Verizon still has expansion options including expanding its wired FIOS network, and its online presence under Verizon Media Group. 

**Stability:** Verizon is a stable cash flow company with an adjusted beta of .7. This illustrates the safety of the company’s stock. Verizon has little room for growth in the saturated wireless telecom market, meaning Verizon’s stock price is not likely to explode in value in the future. However, historically Verizon’s stock price does not fall substantially relative to the general market when macroeconomic forces cause the market to fall. Verizon is not currently competing with other equities as it is with safe debt in our current economic environment. This is because of the current interest rate environment on the U.S. 10-year being less than 1%. This causes investors to look for other high-quality investment alternatives that deliver better yield. Verizon satisfies this type of investor with a yield of over 4% as well as providing market exposure from the general market.

**Execution:** The biggest potential obstacle currently facing Verizon is their execution of rolling out 5g technology. Any hinderance can result in missed revenue, with next year’s iPhone coming out with 5g capable technology, which the iPhone has over 50% market share alone in the smartphone market, could cause many customers to switch to a competitor if Verizon cannot meet demand by that point. Let alone the other half of the market, largely denominated in various android devices, already has 5g capable technology. Should Verizon miss the mark, it could potentially hurt the company for years. However, according to Verizon’s CTO, as of the end of May, they are ahead of schedule deploying 5g. Verizon has a history and reputation of being on top of deploying new technology quickly, while being ahead of schedule, it is plausible to see many customers switch over to Verizon to take advantage of their 5g if Verizon’s competitors can’t meet the 5g demand. Verizon management needs to be able to take advantage of this new technology by charging higher prices to their mobile customers. Any lack in the execution could result in bad revenues and earnings.

**Business Description**

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the parent company to Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group. Verizon provides services such as communications, entertainment, and information to consumer, business, and governmental customers. Employing 135,000 people, 96% are located in the U.S. and over 2,300 retail stores open, and headquartered in New York, NY. In 1877 the bell system was created in the name of Alexander Graham Bell, over time the company slowly expanded across the U.S. and Canada over the next 100 years. Over the years the system evolved to AT&T controlling a bunch of regional company’s providing land line service. In 1982 the U.S. government broke up the monopoly AT&T had into the regional companies, this plan was originally proposed by AT&T. This event was known as the breakup of the bell system and the companies post breakup were known as the “baby bells”. Two of the companies as a result of this breakup were Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp. Verizon was formed in June 2000 with the merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. based in New York city and GTE Corp. based in Irving Texas. Both firms were some of the largest in the industry, and both were heavily focused on the eastern side of the U.S. 

Table 1 below shows Verizon’s consolidated revenues for the years 2019 and 2018. Revenues are broken down into their three subsidiaries of Verizon Consumer, Verizon Business and Verizon Corporate. Eliminations refers to the exchange of cash between these segments as it is not new revenue. Below explains each segment and where each segment gets their revenue broken into a percentage.

    
 **Table 1**

Verizon Consumer Group offers wireless and wireline communications, branded the most extensive wireless network in the U.S., North America is where over 95% of their revenue comes from geographically, the other 5% comes from overseas in Japan, Central America, and selective parts of Europe. Wireline is provided in North Eastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. over fiber-optic lines through their Fios brand, or wireless services provided nationwide on hotspot devices or mobile phones. Both wireline and wireless can be prepaid or postpaid, the majority are in the postpaid segment, paying monthly for the services. The consumer segment provides data connection to 95 million wireless mobile connections, 6 million broadband connections, and 4 million Fios connections: making up 68.8% of revenues. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o1ev1ca08c551.png?width=349&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a2545cd65fb5a525145e02c3ba157034c8a0b60

Verizon Business Group provides the same services to corporate and some governmental agencies with additional services such as “video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products including solutions that support fleet tracking management, compliance management, field service management, and asset tracking” according to Verizon’s 2019 annual report. In all, Verizon’s Business Group is in a position to solve more complex problems that may come up at a business compared to their Consumer Group. Verizon Business Group provides 25million wireless connections and 489 thousand broadband connections: making up 23.8% of total revenues.

 Verizon Corporate includes media business, investments in businesses, and financing expenses outside of the regular course of business. The biggest section here is Verizon Media which provides third party entertainment services such as email, news, and streaming services to customers. Verizon Corporate makes up 7.4% of total revenues.

&#x200B;

Verizon plans to position themselves into future growth trends such as increased expansion of their wireless network, high-speed fiber, and the new introduction of high-speed 5g connections on mobile devices or in-home. With over 17.9 billion invested for capital expenditures at end of year 2019 for 5g technology release.

&#x200B;

**Environmental, Social, Governance and Management Quality**

Environmental criteria include the company’s impact on the environment such as energy use, waste output, and pollution production. In the last 10 years so called “green bonds” has been discussed more about and demand for them has slowly been rising. These green bonds are any bonds issued by a company, where all the money raised from the bonds goes towards any ESG related goal. Verizon in February 2019 issued their first green bond to the total of $1 billion, this is the first green bond issued in the telecom industry as well. Verizon has stated they are committed to being completely carbon neutral in their operations by 2035; this propagates their current goal to “generate renewable energy equivalent to 50% of our total annual electricity consumption by 2025”. Finally, Verizon has stated that they are committed to setting an annual emissions reduction target by fall 2021.

Social criteria include the relationships the company has with business partners, local communities, employee health and safety, and any other “stakeholder” that the company impacts. Verizon claims to focus on their customers upmost before most other stakeholders, they reinforce this through their actions and from their goal of being the best and most reliable network in the U.S. and serves this goal mainly through delivering high quality services through their wireless segment at a reasonable price. Outside of customers Verizon is aiming to contribute 2.5 million hours of volunteer work through their 135 thousand employees, these hours are aimed to improve “digital inclusion, climate protection, and human prosperity”. In Cleveland, Ohio the company is launching 5g enabled classrooms to deliver instruction in struggling middle schools and aims to expand this effort to 100 middle schools in total by 2021. Additionally, to evaluate the employee side of social criteria using a website called Glassdoor is used. Glassdoor is a website where current or past employees can rate the company anonymously on salary, benefits, satisfaction, outlook of the company, and their experience at the company; however, Glassdoor has been known to be biased at times. Verizon has over 21 thousand reviews on Glassdoor, from this large amount of reviews it can be taken with some accuracy. Considering all 21 thousand reviews they are rated at a 74% satisfaction rating, and 68% approve of the CEO, whereas AT&T has a 68% satisfaction rating and 51% approve of the CEO. At Verizon a controversial subject among employees are work-life balance with a 50% split on it needing some improvement or that it is adequate. Over 8,000 reviews claim that Verizon is a good employer when relating to pay and benefits.

Governance criteria includes how transparent and accurate the financial statements are, avoiding conflicts of interest among the executives and board members, and ensuring the company is not engaging in any illegal activities. As far as engaging in illegal activities Verizon has a good track record and no one suspects any major allegations against Verizon, with Verizon being a U.S. dominant business they mostly just have to obey rules and regulations within the U.S. and not balancing between international laws. Verizon has been clear in all of its financial reporting, obeying all GAAP rules and even going above the mark to provide additional information that is non-GAAP with disclosures. Conflicts of interest among the board members meet all laws and guidelines from the NYSE and NASDAQ. Verizon’s board members also meet the “heightened independence criteria” rules from the NYSE and Nasdaq. Regarding the green bond discussed above, they have and will report on how much of the green bond money has been spent and on what projects the money is going to until the note matures.

Overall Verizon is a quality company with quality management, among the 9 board members currently, 3 are African American, and 2 are woman. The company CEO, Hans Vestberg has been with the company since 2017, and CEO since 2018, a noticeably short amount of time compared to peers at AT&T whose CEO has been with the company since 2007. Verizon’s CFO, Matthew Ellis, has been with Verizon since 2016. Verizon’s management is relatively new and most likely experiencing a learning curve still, but so far, they have made strides in redefining Verizon and shows promise to be a strong team long term. Sustainalytics is an ESG rating company who rates companies on a scale of 0-100, they rate VZ at a score of 20, AT&T with a score of 19, and T-Mobile with a score of 25. This is a low score, however, ESG scores are highly subjective and vary widely among different ESG ratings companies. Verizon does not participate in any of the “high risk” ESG industries such as oil or mining, meaning in the grand scheme of company’s they are a relatively sustainable company. While the company can always do better, they aim to bring diversity to the company and strive for transparency. 

**Demographic Trends**

Companies should be aware of demographics and which ones their customers fall under, this information can provide to a company who their core customer base is, and which segments they can expand into. There are many demographics out there, each with their own preferences, tolerances, and taste. Gender, race, and age are the three big demographics, however, there are many more than those three and each can be combined or divided into bigger or smaller groups. Of particular importance to Verizon is age as there is a dilemma currently with an aging work force and how the transition to retirement will be in our society. Called the “Baby Boomers” they are by far the largest section of our population with the most buying power, many of them are about to enter retirement age. Many of these baby boomers are going to start to wind down their portfolios they’ve built up over the course of their lives. Over the next 50 years this population will naturally fade out and their immense buying power will switch to the younger generations. Currently the buying power of generations, while different studies vary on exact numbers, annual spending roughly comes down to about $550 billion for baby boomers, $350 billion for Gen X, $320 billion for Millennials, and $160 billion for the silent generation. The youngest generation, Gen Z, has little to no buying power of their own, however, their parents buy much of what they want with over 93% of households say that they influence purchasing decisions. Gen Z buying power will increase substantially in the future as they enter adulthood. Younger generations have been becoming more acclimated with technology as it has become more readily available and introduced at a younger age. Younger people (under 25) tend to use social media much more than older generations, most of these social media apps can only be accessed through mobile devices. As we observe these younger generations using technology more and becoming more affluent in them, we can assume that these kids will be more accepting of smartphones and other technologies; possible making these devices “essential”. 

By looking at Verizon’s customers we can predict where much of their revenue in the future will be coming from. Verizon’s customers, broken down by age, are as follows: 24.3% of customers in the 18-29 range, 26.1% in the 30-49 range, and 31.58% in the 50-64 range. Totaling our age groups, this accounts for about 82% of Verizon’s customers, the other 18% comes from the ages on the tail end of either side, so the under 18 or 65+ and the corporate customers who are unaffected by these aging demographic trends, there is not any percentage breakdown for these groups. As the 50-64 age group enters retirement they will want to stay in touch with relatives and try to keep busy, a phone is a good way to do this and it can be reasonably predicted that this age group will rise as the Baby Boomers enter retirement. Although this will most likely saturate the market completely and leave no more room for growth for Verizon in the U.S. market, aside from stealing customers from other providers. This effect will most likely be in the next 20-30 years, but at the 50-year time horizon this generation will have dwindled and the largest age of customers will shift to a younger age group.

“Younger people are getting phones”, says the CFO of Verizon at a Morgan Stanley investor meeting. At a younger age many kids are getting cell phones, this ingrains cellphones into kids’ heads and makes it an essential item. Under 18, the generation titled “Gen Z” (born after 1997) is now the largest population in the U.S. with over 90 million, larger than the millennial and Baby Boomer population. Who this generation chooses to have as their cellphone provider will likely depend on who their parents used, or other factors such as environmental sustainable governance ratings which seems to be a top factor within this age group. With this information we can assume that the under 18, and 18-29 age group will increase as young people get more phones due to an increase in population in this age group and the increasing likelihood that this group will obtain phones at a younger age. 

The Pew Research Center conducted a study in February 2019, they found that 96% of people in the U.S. have smart phones and that ethnicities, genders, education, and age seem to have smartphones at about the same levels; in the 91%-100% range. There is likely little market share to be gained by looking at demographic's trends over time other than the extremes of age, as the under 18-year-old are at 92%, and over 65 at 91%.

Currently with the Covid-19 virus shutting down the economy it can be safely predicted that Verizon will have a reduced earnings report through either Verizon delaying payments customers need to make to the company or writing off losses. Although many people see phones as a form of entertainment and people are craving entertainment now more than ever. As for long lasting effects coming about from the change of Covid-19, there may be a few that affect Verizon that are yet to be known.

**Industry Overview and Competitive Positioning**

At the beginning of 2020 in the Telecommunications Industry there were 4 big players, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint. T-Mobile and Sprint have merged as of 4/1/2020 into the company name of T-Mobile. Outside of Verizon the only one bigger than it is AT&T which is diversified outside of telecommunications such as AT&T owning streaming service and entertainment subsidiary HBO, and DirectTV a cable provider. With the T-Mobile and Sprint merger they are still the smallest of the 3 companies, but they are able to compete effectively with Verizon and AT&T. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are the “900-pound gorillas” of the industry.

The industry business operation consists of a provider offering data (or internet connection), and cellphone services to customer on a mobile connection, such as phones. Most of the company’s customer base pays month to month for service, included sometimes in the cost of the service will be a phone or other accessories (such as mobile hotspots, TV plans, or in home internet) that the customer bought with it. However, this makes it easier for a customer switching between providers for the better service as there is no commitment on the customer side.

Verizon’s revenues shown in the table below illustrate stagnant growth in 2018 and rather lackluster growth the other years. Verizon attributes this growth to expanding into new segments and upgrading infrastructure, as well as spending nearly 35 billion on new 5g technology, which is claimed to be revolutionary when it comes out.

Shown in the table below, Verizon has the lowest Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) P/E (Price/Earnings) ratio of 12.46, with AT&T being slightly higher at 15.14. T-Mobile absorbing Sprint has created a very high P/E ratio of 22.59. We can also observe that not only does Verizon have a lower P/E ratio, but they also boast higher return on equity and profit margins compared to their competitors.

**Valuation**

The discounted cash flow valuation methods used for Verizon consist of the dividend growth model, a free cash flow to firm (FCFF) model, a free cash flow to equity (FCFE) model, and a multiples analysis.

The cost of equity calculation is shown below, calculated to be at 7.62% using a 3% risk free rate and an expected market return of 9.6%. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) was calculated to be 5.4%, highlighting the extensive use of cheap debt, about 50% of their capital structure. Their average cost of debt on outstanding bonds was about 3.64%, much lower than what the required return on equity is, bringing cost of capital much lower.

***Dividend Growth Model – Constant Growth:*** Using a constant growth of dividends, and picking a growth rate of 3.5%, taking the average of the last 10 years we see an average increase of about 2.6%, and a 5.1% annual growth during the last 5-years. This will likely decline over an infinite time horizon, using historical data, as such an estimate of 3.5% is used to accurately reflect the economic environment. A 2.6% 10-year growth rate reflects the reality of coming out of the 07-09 financial crisis which does not reflect the current economic environment. This gives an intrinsic value of **$60.79**.

***Dividend Growth Model – Two-Stage Growth Model:*** In the past Verizon has had periods of high dividend growth for a year or two. The last time this happened was briefly after the widespread release of 4g in 2013 and the subsequent increase in earnings growth. From the recent developments of the highly anticipated release of 5g technology, in the two-stage growth model a dividend growth rate of 5% is assumed to be the average for 6 years and then settle at a constant growth of 3.5% indefinitely. This gives an intrinsic value of **$65.77** for the two-stage model.

***Dividend Growth Model – Three-Stage Growth Model:*** As for the three-stage growth model an assumption of an average of 7% dividend growth over the next 2 years, as in the past Verizon has experienced up to 11% dividend growth after the release of this new technology. After this, Verizon will settle into an average 4% dividend growth for 4 years, after which point, a 3.5% constant growth. This gives an intrinsic value of **$66.25** for the three-stage model.

***Free Cash Flow to Firm Model:*** Verizon’s free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) represents the cash flow available to all of the company’s capital providers, this includes bond holders, common shareholders, and occasionally preferred shareholders. Verizon’s actual FCFF is very volatile at first glance, fluctuating between -43% to positive 226%. Most of this volatility is from high amounts of investments of working capital into projects, as is the nature of the business. However, it seems that the cash flows are also very unstable due to Verizon’s taxes in 2017 with the huge tax cuts Verizon was able to get -$9956 (mils), FCFF was significantly affected. Substituting the 2017 tax number to a Verizon average tax payment of $5000 makes FCFF seem much more stable. Averaging out over the course of 5 years, an average of 8% growth in free cash flow to the firm is calculated. In the constant growth model, a growth rate of 3.5% is used. This is from an assumption that one day Verizon will wind down working capital and be able to achieve more stable cash flows. In the two-stage and three-stage models a slightly higher growth over the next 6 years because of the release in 5g technology significantly increasing the growth is used. The average growth rate for the two-stage model is estimated to be at 5% before settling back down to 1.5% growth rate. In the three-stage growth model an estimate of 8% free cash flow growth for 3 years, a 2.5% average for the next 5 years, and then settle back into 1.5% growth. This gives an intrinsic value for constant growth, two-stage, and three-stage models of **$110.57**, **$146.38**, and **$153.58**, respectively.

***Free Cash Flow to Equity Model:*** Verizon’s free cash flow to equity (FCFE) holders represents all cash flow available to common equity holders after all operating expenses, bond payments, investments into both working, and fixed capital have been made. Over the last 5 years FCFE has grown on average at 4%, however, the per year change is also very volatile, much like FCFF. Three separate years had negative FCFE of around -70%, and our other two years had positive 1,393% and 307%. This is mostly due to paying down debt rapidly or taking out a lot of debt to fund new projects such as 5g rolling out, mainly the latter. Taking out net borrowing from the calculation creates a more stable model, as such net borrowing is taken out and a growth rate of 10.3% is calculated. As such FCFE growth rates are estimated to be slightly lower than the average because while taking out net borrowing shows more stable cash flows, repaying the debt will lower cash flow available to common stock. That said, in the constant growth model a growth rate of 4% is used. The two-stage model a growth rate of 7% for the next 6 years, then settling to 4% for terminal value. In the 3-stage model an estimate of a 10% return over the next 3 years and a 6% return for 5 years, before settling into the terminal growth rate of 4%. This gives an intrinsic value for the constant growth, two-stage, and three-stage      
 models of **$106.35**, **$124.20**, and **$135.29**, respectively.

***Multiples Analysis:*** In this valuation approach a price/earnings (P/E) ratio and enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratios are used. Through the P/E approach, Verizon currently has a P/E fluctuating between 12-13 and historically they have had P/E’s up to 20 in the last 5 years. Their competitors AT&T and T-Mobile have P/E ratios roughly around 15 and 20 respectively, and the industry standard is P/E is 15. Verizon has an earnings per share of $4.43; however, with 5g technology becoming widely available, a modest earnings growth to $4.90 per share (a 10.6% increase) is estimated for next year. This calculation leads us to an intrinsic value of $73.50. As for the EV/EBITDA approach, Verizon’s current EBITDA is $47,152 and with a ratio of 8.2. With an estimated EBITDA value of $49,500 and a target ratio of 9, this calculation gives us a value of **$76.08** one year from now.

***Valuation Summary:*** Verizon is a company with stable cashflows and without much room for significant growth. This makes Verizon perfect for a dividend growth model valuation and is the most accurate of the three models. FCFF is confusing and hard to estimate because of the massive tax changes year to year. FCFE is misleading as the huge amounts of borrowing throws off calculations as net borrowing is not typically used as funds available to shareholders, as such net borrowing has been taken out of the analysis. A growth rate reduction of 2-3% is used for FCFE to account for the reduced cash flow available to common shareholders resulting from paying off the debt in the future. The multiples analysis shows that Verizon may be undervalued currently with a P/E ratio hovering around 12, significantly lower than the industry average and peers. In all the dividend models are most accurate as investors in this company value the stable cash flows and dividends. To arrive to the final intrinsic value estimate, a blend of the three dividend growth models is used, with a 30% weighting on the constant and three-stage growth models and a 40% weighting on the two-stage model. This weighting provides a final intrinsic value of **$64.42**.

**Financial Analysis**

**Liquidity** – As of March 31st, the most up to date financial statements available. Verizon’s liquidity is poor, Cash as a percent of total assets is only 2.3%, although slightly higher than the last 5 years of around 0.9%, this influx of cash is most likely a response to the Covid-19 epidemic. The cash came from 7.5 billion of new debt, all of which expires before 2020. Doing a Current Ratio, and Quick Ratio for Verizon (Current Assets / Current Liabilities and Current Assets – Inventory / Current Liabilities respectively).  This calculation provides poor numbers, with the current ratio being at .991, and the quick ratio being at .952. This shows that Verizon has way more in liabilities than assets, and if they needed to sell off assets quickly and liquidate the company, in case of a bankruptcy, they would not have enough to meet their obligations. Although due to the nature of the business this is extremely unlikely and as discussed below the debt is manageable. This is further reinforced via the Net debt to EBITDA ratio, a common way at to measure if the amount of income generated is available to pay down its current debt. Any number higher than 4 or 5 typically raises concerns, however, Verizon is well below that number as of now and shows adequate debt management.

**Profitability Ratios** – Verizon has a profit margin of 14.6% in 2019, effectively doubling their 2014 profit margin of 7.6% shown in the table below. Return on Invest Capital is also very high number at about 46% and Return on Equity slightly lower at 31%; however, these ratios have fallen the past 6 years from 114% and 78% respectively. This dramatic decrease is attributed to the payoff of massive investments into 4g technology in 2014, and now we have much lower percentages due to massive investment increases into 5g spending. These ratios will most likely return to much higher numbers over the next 2-3 years.

\*Equity Multiplier\* refers to Assets / Shareholder Equity-1 and Sustainable Growth Rate g\* uses Equity Multiplier\* instead of Equity Multiplier, Equity Multiplier uses Assets / Shareholder Equity of the same period.

**Debt** \- Verizon is levered at about 2 currently, although they have reduced that from 9.2 in 2014. This means that Verizon has double the amount of debt than they do equity. Their debt ratio is at .79 currently, although that has dropped substantially from .95 in 2014. Debt ratio illustrates what portion of the company’s assets is owed to creditors. Currently most of this debt is used for various infrastructure costs for 5g, as well as introducing a new “Green Bond” for environmental social governance, the first in the telecom industry. Using market values rather than book values, Verizon has a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The times interest earned ratio is currently at 6.44, meaning they currently make more than enough in operating income to pay for interest, so they are not currently at risk of defaulting. As well as their times burden covered for 2020 at 5.28, allowing Verizon to be rated as investment grade bonds.

**Asset Management Ratios** – Shown above in the second table, asset turnover is at about 45.2% currently, although this number is misleading as they sell a service and accumulate assets over time without having to sell them to customers. Shown in the table below is collection period, inventory turnover and payables period, with collection period and payables period having risen between 2014 and 2019 from 40.19 to 70.39 and 40.92 to 51.52, respectively. This shows that Verizon has been extending receivables at a faster rate than payables, ideally, Verizon would like to see that reversed. Supplier terms are currently unknown for Verizon, however, payables period being under 60 days, they are still getting favorable terms. Inventory turnover has decreased slightly from 43 to 38 since 2014, which is promising and shows more inventory going out the door.

  As for industry averages, it is shown that Verizon has a much higher quick ratio and a lower times interest earned (TIE). The leverage ratio, and debt to equity ratio is about the same as the industry average. In some ways Verizon company is close to industry averages with the exception of being slightly more levered currently. 

&#x200B;

**Investment Risks**

**Debt Levels and Credit Rating:** Verizon currently has debt levels equal to about its market capitalization, meaning the company nearly has just as much debt as it does equity outstanding. These high levels of debt represent significant risks via Verizon’s obligations. A single quarter of abrupt cash flow disruption could force Verizon into default on much of its outstanding debt. The high debt levels Verizon currently deals with could potentially lower their credit rating with the credit rating agencies. This would be detrimental to Verizon as it would affect their ability to introduce new debt at low rates, and hurt Verizon’s profitability.

**Geographic:** Currently Verizon mainly operates in North America. This provides significant systematic risk on the part of Verizon. Terrorist attacks, regulation change, or any other factor that could negatively affect the North American region is a significant risk to Verizon. 

**5g:** Any delay in the release of the 5g network could significantly hurt Verizon’s business. This technology is new and is creating rapid change within the industry that Verizon must be a part of moving forward or risk losing customers to a competitor. Introducing new technology also means that they must phase out old, unprofitable technology on a cost-effective basis or else Verizon is at risk or having reduced profitability.

**Competition:** With the recent merger of T-Mobile and Sprint into T-Mobile there is a much more competitive landscape for Verizon. Before the merger, the only real competitor in size was AT&T, now with the merger Verizon has two competitors of similar size. The merger is particularly dangerous to Verizon as the company is not diversified outside of the industry like AT&T, and a new significant entrant into the industry could pose a huge threat as T-Mobile will be able compete with Verizon on a more cost-effective basis than previously.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** The two biggest factors affecting Verizon’s stock price are identified as the change in the cost of equity, and the change in the dividend rate. This is because in the dividend discount model the future dividends are discounted by the cost of equity and the annual dividend rate shows how the stock price will change given all else is equal. Shown below are the changes in the cost of equity and dividend rate plus or minus 2% and 1% and how it effects the stock price. For the cost of equity calculation, it is important to realize that rising interest rates, changing expected return in the market, or a change in the volatility (beta) of the stock could affect our cost of equity, and in turn, our intrinsic value. As for the change in dividend growth rate, will easily affect a change in our intrinsic value calculation by changing the projected future cashflows. Below in table 1 illustrates both possibilities and the potential impact on the calculated intrinsic value. The most probable of these two is a change in the cost of equity as the economy is currently in an extremely low interest rate environment, and the cost of equity calculation assumes a 3% interest rate. Changing the rate to the market risk free rate could substantially raise intrinsic value; however, our 3% assumed risk free rate more accurately reflect what investors expect, and not the artificially pushed down price shown in the market right now.

 **Cost of Equity**

Calculating the cost of equity by using a risk-free rate of 3% as current U.S. 10 year bond rates are at all time lows and has a possibility to not accurately reflect the actual cost of business within the U.S. for Verizon. Using an expected return on the market of 9.6%, which is the average annual return in the stock market going back to 1928. Finally, using an adjusted beta of .7. The cost of equity is calculated to be 7.62%

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital**

Finding the market value of long-term debt by taking 43 long term bonds Verizon currently has outstanding and took the current price each bond trades at. Using this information, the market value of long-term debt from these bonds was found but does not reflect \*all\* debt. Taking the average price each was selling at, weighted by amount outstanding, multiplied this average by the book value of debt to comes to MV of LTD of $129,747.73 billion.

To find the pretax cost of debt by taking the yield on each bond weighted by percent of total debt, summing this up a cost of debt to Verizon of 2.69% was calculated.

To find the weighted average cost of capital follow the above formula. Spelled out is: weight of equity x cost of equity + weight of debt x cost of debt x 1- tax rate. The calculated weighted average cost of capital to be 4.7%. This accurately reflects the cheap use of debt Verizon takes advantage of as the cost of equity is significantly higher at 7.62%. This is how Verizon should be funding its operations as this substantially lowers their cost of capital and they can sustain this sizable amount of debt through the stable cash flows as is the nature of their business.",78,0.98,1592342756.0

No fund with any sizable assets can build much of a position that is meaningful given the $170 mil mkt cap and average volume of $250,000. Good opportunity to get in now before the share price is driven up as more analysts pay attention to it. Look how other NASH stocks measure up compared to how undervalued THTX is, like MDGL.

t3_hbd5lc,How do you look at ROIC for asset light businesses?,"Hello everyone!

I use NOPAT / (NWC + PP&E + other tangible assets ) to calculate ROIC of business,

If I want to evaluate capital deployment skills of managers I also include goodwill and intangible assets in denominator, but most of the time I’d like to know ROIC of business.

Problem is that for asset light companies (tech) which has negative NWC, IC is approaching to 0 making ROIC close to infinity, or even IC is negative.

What’s your though process in this situation?

\-Do you include only tangible part in IC ignoring negative NWC ? Cause tangible part is still important.

\-Or do you use other metric cause ROIC is not relevant for asset light business – if business double it’s IC (offices, computers, etc) you can’t expect NOPAT to double.

Basically I understand that negative IC/asset lightness is good, especially while business is growing. But I can’t understand how to evaluate “how good is it” and how to use it as comparable metric between asset light businesses cause once IC negative/close to 0 it does not makes sense as denominator.",19,0.95,1592481126.0

Although I realize I am probably in the presence of Equity-Gods here, a little warning to some people that aren't:

I have no track record. I am just a dude sitting in his pajama's looking at stocks. Never buy a stock because of my, or anyone's suggestion for that matter.

Do your own research. Lynch put it best: ""At $10 I called my mother. I said mom you gotta look at this Kaiser Industries, I mean how much lower can it go?"". That's the situation you want to be in, calling your mother to ask how much lower it can go rather than dumping the stock because ""Panic!"". I frequently call my mother to ask how much lower a stock can go. Sometimes she gets angry because it's 4 AM and I forgot it's the Hong Kong session, but the moral support of ""Stocks always make you lose all your money, sell now"" really helps.

Also my stocks so far performed like total dogs for 4 years before ever showing a return. You have been warned.

What they do:

The business essentially boils down to flu medicine, Kewei (Oseltamivir Phosphate). Here a lazy link to Wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir)

They have a monopoly on this market. They do have other products, but in my opinion the company will remain a one-trick pony for the foreseeable future. Oseltamivir Phosphate is listed on the Medical Reimbursement Drug List in China. Worker-Investors of the world, unite! Praise social healthcare!

**Edit 20/06/2019:**

Kewei is 2 different products.

Kewei Capsules: The traditional product. There is no ""monopoly"" on this product. The company pays royalties to Shenzhen HEC Industrial (50.40% shareholder of the company) for the rights of selling this product. This property of Shenzhen HEC Industrial expires on 10 March 2024.

26.03% of total sales in 2019, sales increased by 173.53% in the year 2019 when compared to the year 2018.

1.38 B Gross sales - 0.28 B Cost of sales = 1.10 B Gross profit (Estimated around 79% gross margin).

&#x200B;

Kewei Granules: Same active ingredient, not in capsule form. The company has a patent on this product.

69.40% of total sales in 2019, sales increased by 166% in the year 2019 when compared to the year 2018.

3.67 B Gross sales - 0.60 B Cost of sales = 3.07 B Gross profit (Estimated around 83% gross margin).

This product recently passed the Consistency Evaluation process.

The Chinese patent office lists the patent as having been filed/approved 2006. No duration mentioned. From my limited knowledge patents in China last 10 or 20 years. The company writes down patents over a 12 year period, the company states that the patent on this product lasts until 2026. This is entirely believable with a 20 year patent protection on a patent approved in 2006.

**/edit**

There is an interesting drug in development, Recombinant Human Insulin. China is huge, and has a population that already has a very high rate of Diabetes. As the Chinese become wealthier and start adopting the SCD (Standard Chinese Diet... basically Standard American Diet in China) we can expect this to skyrocket even further. Many might know that Japan is extremely focused on maintaining lower body weight for its citizens, and that Japan has a relatively good situation when it comes to the health of it's citizens, especially when compared to the USA. Yet Japan's rate of Diabetes is still 7.9% of the adult population. China is already at 10.9% and increasing, but even in a best case scenario ending up with a Diabetes rate of around 8% of the adult population would still produce a huge domestic market.

This is all just a possibility, and I am not taking this into account in my valuation due to the various obstacles and uncertainties involved in gaining market share. It is, however, something to keep in mind as a possible hedge against the risk of Kewei losing market share in the future. This is a 25 RMB Billion market, even 10% market share would be game-changing.

&#x200B;

Returning value seems to be high on the companies' agenda. Maybe a little too high. Dividend of 0.72 HKD per share is not something I consider good (not a fan of dividend in general), but there have also been large share repurchases at low stock price. Recently the company cancelled 1% of total shares outstanding. These shares were purchased at an average (pre-split) price of around 29 HKD. This translates to 14.5 HKD average adjusting for the stock split. They are better at buying cheap than I am, which makes me feel insecure. The fact that they paid 40 HKD average for the last batch of 1% of total shares makes me feel much better. An average of around 34.5 HKD still isn't a bad repurchase price (17.2 HKD after stock-split).

&#x200B;

**Edit 20/06/2019:**

Corporate structure:

Some clarification with regard to the shares and ownership.

There's 2 types of shares. Domestic Shares and H-Shares. H-Shares are on the open international market and traded on the HKSE.

The Domestic Shares are fully owned by the majority controlling company, Shenzhen HEC Industrial, which controls 50.4% of all shares (100% of Domestic Shares) through a network of subsidiaries.

The company has no single founder with a large shareholder position. Management has worked in various of the other companies in the Shenzhen HEC Industrial group.

Shenzhen HEC Industrial has a large interest in selling patents/new drugs to the company, with the company having ""pre-emptive"" rights to obtain new patents and rights to sell from the research oriented subsidiaries of Shenzhen HEC Industrial.

Risks:

Losing market share in Oseltamivir Phosphate: This would be a death sentence due to the company's reliance on this product.

Market meltdown and increasing political tensions between China and the USA: However, the company is quite insulated against these risks. The company proved impervious to the last recession in China (2015-2016), however, worst case scenario assumptions do conclude stock price could go down significantly (Can't they always?).

Coronavirus: This is probably the biggest reason the stock is down so much. It's almost certain the company was affected, but considering how essential medication is I doubt this would influence the long-term value significantly. The risk is should the coronavirus have truly hit this company hard there could be a nasty surprise in September when the Interim report comes out. This is not an out-of-this-world assumption, considering Hubei province was ground-zero (5.5% of sales, also research/development operations there).

Convertible debt: I don't like this, but the company has had a very good financially conservative track record, with debt usually being paid off quickly. Convertible, though. Eww.

Big trouble in big China: I have good faith in China and it's system, but not everyone seems to. China does have additional risks related to how things work differently there and that many of investors abroad might not fully comprehend all of these nuances and are therefore at risk of making a bad decision regarding investments in China.

That's it. I'm a simple guy that looks at stuff simplistically. Maybe a bit too simple? I also didn't want to go too far into extremely basic stuff like Balance Sheet. Putting up debt/etc for the last 10 years would add minimal information, despite the fact that I took it into account. All that matters is they have high debt now, but have paid off debt aggressively in the past. I consider dividend payouts with debt a definite negative though, would've liked to see that dividend go towards paying off debt but you can't have it all. Finally, sorry it turned out so freaking long. I even left a lot that was of ""meh"" importance out because it would've turned into a book.

Subject me to the most brutal criticism you have. I shall now go read random stuff on the internet before dissecting the entire Korean Stock Exchange since I'm quite burned out from looking at every single H-Share company and staying up all night on Friday to buy this. You Americans are lucky, can casually check out the Hong Kong stock market in the evening.",15,0.94,1592609287.0
t3_hbx6ht,ScS Investment Thesis,"**Update 22/6:** I decided not to invest in the end. I still believe the margin of safety is there, but I don't think the risk/reward payoff is as good as a couple of other companies I've been considering. The major shareholder selling off shares came very quickly after the very long-standing CEO announced his retirement. Those two things may not be connected, but when considering companies without moats, the quality of the management is of the utmost importance and not knowing who that team will be led by next year at a time where there could be a difficult trading period for the company left me with more uncertainty than I'd like.

Firstly, this is all just my opinion and research- the numbers may be wrong, what I infer from the numbers may be wrong and this is not a recommendation for you to buy, it's me looking for feedback on my thesis as I'm considering buying shares (but I haven't yet done so).

**Business Overview**

ScS is the UK's second biggest upholstery company with 9.3% of the market. The biggest is DFS with 32% (25% from DFS and 7% from Sofology).


ScS’s market share has grown sporadically since its 7.9% share at IPO in 2015.


As well as selling sofas, the company also sells flooring, although on a much smaller scale. Flooring revenue for H1 2020 counted for 12% of gross sales. It is in a much worse market position here as the 8th biggest supplier. Its market share has dropped in H1 2020, which it attributes to unsustainable pricing from Carpetright and another flooring retailer and its preference to sell less volume at a profitable level than participate in a pricing war.


The business had gross sales of £333.3 million in the year end 27 July 2019. This comes from selling sofas (£274.2M, +1.2% YoY) and flooring (£42.3M, -1.2% YoY) from their 100 UK stores, as well as selling online (£16.8M, +21.7%).


As well as operating from their 100 owned stores and website, the business previously ran 27 concessions in House of Fraser that equated to 8% of sales in 2017 which were shut in 2018 after House of Fraser went into administration. The closure of these concessions has muddied the waters of the business’s historic financials. ScS is slow-growing in terms of revenue, so the HoF closures turned what would have been 2% growth in 2019 to a 5% decline.


**Nature of the investment**

I don’t see this is a cutting-edge business with high growth potential and a strong moat. I do however see it as a business which is currently selling below intrinsic value based on 2019’s financials and even with no share price appreciation, the dividend yield alone is appealing. Given the nature of this investment, I believe it is most important to focus on the financial management of the company and the risks/threats to the business to ensure the business is capable of handling market downturns and maintaining market share.


**Financial Management**

The business appears to me to be run very conservatively, especially when compared to its closest peer- DFS. They ran a debt-free operation until drawing down £12m from their revolving credit facility in March to ensure sufficient liquidity throughout the lockdown. Upon reopening 80 of their England stores on 23rd May they announced that they had cash of £48.3m (including the £12m RCF) and although the directors gave no guidance on the months ahead, they expressed their confidence in their liquidity, ability to weather the market downturn caused by COVID-19 and return to growth ‘when the economy recovers’. It is worth noting that as the business receives cash upfront and pays suppliers afterwards, a significant proportion of that £48.3m (if not all of it) will be required to pay suppliers, so this measurement definitely overstates the company’s liquidity.

**Risks/Threats**

The two main risks here are that the total upholstery market shrinks, or the company’s market share shrinks (or both).

_Total upholstery market shrinks_

The current upholstery market size is £3.2 billion. Pre-2008 it was higher, peaking at £3.92 billion in 2007. Its lowest five year average was from the years 2010-2014 where it averaged £2.96 billion. Estimating owner earnings for these years (assuming today’s 9.3% market share and making some assumptions around which expenses are static at today’s levels and which scale with spend) I arrive at an intrinsic value for the business of £65 million. This is using my 15% minimum acceptable rate of return. This suggests to me that even a permanent reduction in the size of the upholstery market won’t result in losses, providing the business holds market share.

However, in the last few years where the market has decreased by 3%, non-House of Fraser revenue has increased by 8%, more than offsetting this decline. If this trend continues, even in the face of a permanently reduced market, I believe the business is undervalued.

_Losing upholstery market share - through market disruption (i.e. the Amazon effect)_

Given the high price points and the long-term nature of the purchase, as well as one of the most important features being comfort, sofa sales don’t lend themselves well to online-only retailers. Amazon had 1.9% of the upholstery market in 2019, which was 0% growth on the previous year. Whilst it's never wise to count Amazon out, the current low price of the shares means that according to my calculation of owner earnings (discounted at 15% rate), we would have broken even on our investment in 5 years. Yes, Amazon may take market share, but ScS are rapidly growing online sales themselves and within a 5 year time period I don't see Amazon as a major threat to their business.

Whilst I'm confident Amazon aren't an existential threat, the uptake in online purchasing can't be denied. Most customers report researching online prior to visiting a store, and the proportion of customers who do buy without visiting a store (10% according to DFS in 2019) is indeed rising. The main risk I see here is that ScS are behind the curve on online retailing. They attempted to purchase sofa.com, but this fell through. I believe that improving their own SEO (in a cost-efficient manner) would be far more useful than purchasing another online retailer. I've read an SEO analysis of the UK sofa industry, specifically comparing DFS and ScS that stated ScS was far behind the curve in terms of generating traffic for its site, and concluded this with some of my own naïve research of searching for various keywords and seeing whose ads and organic links show up. Regardless of the business's SEO setbacks, they are still the second biggest player in the market, so given the amount of research customers reportedly do when purchasing a sofa, I find it unrealistic that the average consumer wouldn't come across ScS's site during their online research- especially if as the majority of customers do, they intend to complete their purchase in store. Additionally, although branded searches can be described as rising or falling depending on the pre & post periods used for ScS, over any time period they appear to be far outpacing growth in DFS although doing so from a much smaller base; the same can be said for online revenue growth.

_Losing upholstery market share - DFS_

DFS as a group is the much bigger market share threat in my eyes. DFS (including Sofology) have a market share 3.4 times that of ScS, and due to the growth of Sofology outpacing ScS, this is likely to increase further (although this is partially offset by DFS’s core brand declining in market share). If we believe there are moats at play in the upholstery retail business, we should be very wary of DFS as a competitor. Marketing expenses aren't trivial in this business, and with a larger customer base, DFS will certainly have efficiencies of scale there. That being said, it is ScS, not DFS with the highest conversion of revenue into operating profit at 4.6%, compared to DFS's 4.1%. That's despite ScS having gross profit margins 10 p.p. lower than DFS- however, it is hard to tell how much of this is due to DFS attempting to grow quicker than ScS through new store openings.

I therefore think it is prudent to further split this risk into two areas:

_Sofology market share growth_

Sofology’s current trajectory of market share looks set to overtake ScS somewhere in the region of 2022 to 2023. It’s unlikely that much of this will come at the expense of ScS due to Sofology’s more high-end offering (DFS have also mentioned that Sofology has had little cannibalisation of DFS’s core business), but it will certainly bolster the DFS group’s position in the industry.

I am therefore content that ScS need not worry about Sofology’s expansion too much. The real threat Sofology brings is if it provides extra capital for DFS’s core business to fight ScS in a price war.

_DFS core business market share advantage_

For whatever reason, DFS don't appear to have been able to use their increased market share to dominate ScS in terms of either profitability or more growth. Their most recent half year results note that although their core brand revenues are declining, they historically have grown market share during market downturns. It seems unlikely to me that this growth will come at the expense of ScS given the value-oriented nature of both suppliers and the trends of both businesses over the past five years.


It's hard for me to put a causal driver behind DFS's core brand market share decline (perhaps their management is stretched too thin across multiple smaller brands or they are spending too much time looking for more acquisitions, perhaps they've just had bad luck with their store placements being in areas of worse consumer confidence), but I'm content with seeing ScS's revenues grow amidst a shrinking market whilst DFS's are shrinking.

_Losing flooring market share_

The flooring market seems to be more volatile than the furniture market, and ScS’s position within this market has been very volatile as of late. ScS introduced flooring into their product mix in 2012, and since then it has grown rapidly to account for £42m in gross sales. From 2015 to 2019 (inclusive) sales had grown at a rate of 20%, 5%, 7%, before decreasing by 1% in 2019 and 13% in H1 2020 (this ended at the end of January 2020 so this decline was pre-coronavirus).


I'm reminded of the quote 'the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent' here. The current market environment will undoubtedly have resulted in many companies trying to sell off inventory at record-low prices when stores reopen. I believe that management has the right attitude towards trading, reminiscent of how Warren Buffett approaches insurance. Whilst they'll likely further lose market share in the short term, if Carpetright are forced to close stores, ScS would likely benefit substantially from that. Also, even modest growth in sofa sales would offset major declines in flooring as evidenced in H1 2020 where gross sales grew 0.5% despite the flooring decline.",2,0.75,1592556363.0

I think it’s probably particularly relevant to look out for any information / news regarding a software transition to ARM during WWDC this week. When Apple originally announced it’s transition from PowerPC to Intel, it was also during a similar WWDC keynote.

If Macs really will be transitioning to ARM in 2021, then it would be extraordinarily strange if nothing about ARM is mentioned software wise with respect to the release of their new operating system and at least some mention of support for x64-86 compatibility / emulation.

I'm trying to figure his back of the envelope math he uses for this Korean net-net. Based on the transcript from someone's notes:

>Example: Korean Company  
>  
>\-60M market cap, pre-tax earnings of 31M, roughly 2x pre-tax earnings.  
>  
>\-Book value of 230M, what constitutes book value? If you are an owner, look at: fixed assets, working capital, don’t count on goodwill.  
>  
>\-Basically you see with 60M in market cap, 30M in pre-tax, $240M in book value ($180M in fixed assets)  
>  
>\-Of the 70M in current assets, it is all cash  
>  
>\-Of 180M in fixed assets, they own 100% of a hotel, recorded 30M as book. Own 13% of a department store recorded as 30M.  
>  
>\-Look up the department store, it roughly has a market cap of 600M. 13% gives you roughly 80M. So the book value undervalues it by another 50M.  
>  
>\-They own 15% of 3 cable companies and a whole bunch of real estate.  
>  
>\-Put it all together: Paying 60M, 70M in net cash, **another 100M in stock**, 30M in hotel with a value that has not been changed in last 10 years while real estate market has gone up in 10 years. Went to Korea, looked at hotel and department stores.  
>  
>\-Checked recent transaction of properties in neighborhood, value is likely 2-3x what is on the book. **But take what is on the book anyway, add 150M**. Add that to rest and you get **320M in assets** that you are paying 60M for and earning 30M annually from operations.

So 70 in cash, 180 in fixed assets from the asset side, equivalent to roughly 240-250 in book value (no debt). Where does the 100 in stock come from? And if he's using the book value of properties at 150 (why is this not 180), how do you end up with total asset value of 320, more than what's on the balance sheet?

Also, anyone know what Korean company he might be referencing? Might be just easier to look it up lol",12,0.88,1593278451.0

# BKNG: Optimistic valuation side-steps possible travel recovery mishaps.

**A QUICK HISTORY**

Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) has been a fantastic investment as globe-trotting travel becomes an accessible lifestyle. $1,000 invested in 2010 would have become $9,170 by the decade’s end. In the wake of the Great Recession, individuals’ buying power has exploded thanks to online platforms/aggregators. Consequently, offline channels’ demise (e.g. [Thomas Cook](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thomas-cook-grp-investment-explainer/thomas-cook-collapses-why-and-what-happens-now-idUSKBN1W804O)) has further contributed to growth, however market-share theft begins to slow – as travel agencies cease operations. The homogeneity of options available further favours **BKNG**’s business model, however the rise of Airbnb might contradict that. Further travel trends of the past decade can be read [here](https://skift.com/2019/12/31/2010s-the-decade-travel-lost-control-of-its-destiny/).

**BUSINESS MODEL**

&#x200B;

[Table 1: Operating margins of select firms operating in sub-sectors of Travel and Tourism.](https://preview.redd.it/o0d5piytvv751.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c01206c1786337eb581e5c4716afda061619693)

High margin opportunities are rare within Travel and Tourism (“the sector”). **BKNG** possess a high-margin business model, serving a typically low-margin sector.

Booking Holdings’ portfolio contains market leaders, differentiated by business model and/or geography.

* **Booking.com** | The pièce de résistance. It is the [\#1](https://www.similarweb.com/website/booking.com/) travel platform across USA and Europe.
* **Agoda** | Ranking [\#4](https://www.similarweb.com/website/agoda.com/), as market leader in East Asia.
* **Rentalcars.com** | [\#1](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/travel-and-tourism/car-rentals/) platform-only (unlike Enterprise and Hertz) car rental aggregator.
* **Priceline.com** | The once flagbearer of aggregators, focussed on US and Canada.
* **KAYAK** | Successor to **Priceline.com**. USA and China are top markets.
* **OpenTable** | Restaurant booking and management services in primarily USA and Canada.

In Western markets, notable competition remains Expedia (**EXPE**), whilst Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) focusses on Asia. Its distinct businesses highlight their aspiration of “[the connected trip](https://skift.com/2019/12/03/what-does-online-travel-really-mean-by-a-connected-trip/)”, where a universe of services delivers an end-to-end vacation experience.

Revenue segments explained:

* **Agency revenues** | Commission taken without handling of payments – e.g. the “booking” and the “sale” are disparate.
* **Merchant revenues** | Commission is taken in addition to payment processing, fees etc.
* **Advertising and other revenues** | In-site advertising (“featured”); referrals fees by KAYAK; and bookings management services provided by OpenTable.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: BKNG revenue streams.](https://preview.redd.it/rp2f45e8wv751.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23a063ca382c6b421441c0933ead12aec0a1849c)

Aggregators suffer from low differentiation, meaning that KAYAK nor Priceline are dominant, however remain important for directing users to platforms (such as Booking.com or Agoda). Ownership or minority stakes encourages aggregators to selectively direct.

* Expedia (**EXPE**) has stakes in Despegar \[Latin America\] (**DESP**) and Trivago \[Europe\] (**TVGO**).
* Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) has stakes in Tongcheng Elong \[China\] and MakeMyTrip \[India\] (**MMYT**).
* Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) has stake in Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) – there’s always a bigger fish!

It’s dominant position worldwide combined with its vision make **BKNG** an attractive business.

**SHORT-TERM: AFTERMATH OF A PANDEMIC**

""I believe the COVID-19 virus will impact global travel more than the 9/11 terror attacks, the SARs epidemic and the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis combined.""*Glen D. Fogel, CEO of Booking Holdings (April 2020)*

This may sound fear-inducing but in reality, this statement says very little. Modern tourism has shown remarkable [resilience](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/book/10.18111/9789284414444) to past shocks. Like past crises, COVID-19’s impact can be separated into two hurdles to be overcome: the initial shock and the tail. The tourism-related impact events mentioned by Fogel are assessed.

* **September 11th terror attacks** | 1-day event created uncertainty of global travel, using aeroplanes. The sector generally recovered with 1 year, but NY tourism took [longer](http://www.modul.ac.at/uploads/files/Theses/Bachelor/BYSYUK_Impact_of_9_11_on_US_and_International_Tourism_Development.pdf).
* **2002-2004 SARS Outbreak** | Multi-year regional outbreak however Chinese tourism was not globally significant, accounting for [3.2%](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284406647) of all spending vs. [20%](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152) today.
* **Global Financial Crisis** | Sector ramifications felt later, however growth returned in [2010](https://www.unglobalpulse.org/project/economic-crisis-tourism-decline-and-its-impact-on-the-poor-2011/).

These events lack global severity or were felt over either the short-term or long-term. The [2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami](https://www.britannica.com/event/Indian-Ocean-tsunami-of-2004) characterises a shock event with long-term sector damage. All nations within the region [recovered](https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/EID14/EID14015FU1.pdf) by 2006, apart from worst-hit Indonesia where visitations returned by 2007. This is further testament to the sector’s ability to withstand the most brutal of events.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Variation in online traffic of select travel websites.](https://preview.redd.it/pvnb7gbrwv751.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=733932754a9a77ce73a35dd11ecf8ca1c4633e7f)

Further, [online traffic](https://www.similarweb.com/website/booking.com/) indicates a recovery. European-focussed platforms (HRS.de) and automotive rental platforms (Rentalcars.com & CarRentals.com). Regardless, average visits are down 70% since January, even after a May rebound.

This information may be received as comforting; however, the short-term outlook continues to remain choppy. A full sector recovery in 2020 is unlikely. The majority of BKNG sales stem from hard-hit USA and Europe, which [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/974548/when-will-travel-and-tourism-recover) predicts will not share a Chinese-style rebound. Moreover, consider the seasonality of booking periods. Vacations are normally booked 100-150 days in [advance](https://supercontrol.co.uk/the-bottom-line-on-bookings), implying – under normal circumstances – vacations up to September are mostly accounted for. Heavy sector discounting will spur some, but the importance of 1H sales remains undeniable.

&#x200B;

[Table 2: BKNG quarterly sales for 2019A and 2020E.](https://preview.redd.it/11rg2lmwwv751.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdde2b761e50593fcb2cd7249b5961cbd8a054fa)

The above table presents a Base scenario revenue change of -52.68% in 2020. Assumptions are made in blue.

**LONG TERM: AFTERMATH OF AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN**

The second sector-wide question refers to when will normality resume – indicated by sales resuming to 2019 levels. Research by [Wedbush](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3572209-booking-holdings-not-v-shaped-story-wedbush) points towards a multi-year recovery.

[Table 3: Modelled scenarios for BKNG post-coronavirus recovery.](https://preview.redd.it/lyfiay5dxv751.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06f543fc99bcc413ce66b9b284dcea935ddf29a)

Beyond, when focussing on the long-term prospects of **BKNG**, its fate is tied to, namely, sector growth and competition.

The exemplary track record of **BKNG** tells one possible story. “A rising tide lifts all boats” tells another possible story. As globe-trotting tourism becomes attainable to half of the world’s households by [2025](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/partner-with-us/documents/global-travel-and-tourism-insights-by-visa.pdf), sector growth is expected to outpace economic growth.

&#x200B;

[Table 4: Travel spending forecasts \(Visa, 2016\).](https://preview.redd.it/1yyjwe9hxv751.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=9260f1ff403aa9266e5e4ad2993afc78e4944f02)

If **BKNG** is to capitalize on this, capturing the Asian market is crucial. Chinese dominance will extend – only 10% of the population are passport holders; forecast to be 20% by [2027](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152). Agoda is the market-leader here, however strong liquidity enables inorganic growth levers to be pulled. The then Priceline Group acquired Booking.com in 2005 for $135M; a drop in the ocean compared to their current balance. With low interest rates, this should offset risks brought by increased debt.

When assessing competition, mode of booking (i.e. online) is unlikely to change, however preferred platform may. Management and others’ [concerns](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/google-moves-travel-expedia-group-ceo-calls-level-playing-field-search-results/) are mainly directed towards “Big Tech” firms Facebook (**FB**) and Google (**GOOGL**), due to their ability to integrate travel booking into other products (e.g. Google Maps). Low switching costs mean Booking Holdings’ established presence will provide little defence against the [2nd most valuable global brand](https://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/list). Antitrust concerns in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_vs._Google) and the limited presence of “Big Tech” in Asia provides **BKNG** with valuable time to strategize a defence. Further, medium-term tailwinds are unlikely to be derailed as a result.

[ Figure 5: What customers value the most from online travel platforms. Useful when assessing the comparative advantages of Booking Holdings’ platforms against peers.](https://preview.redd.it/paa525anxv751.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=937aaba07609077e10030780cdd4b30d0ac3ce43)

**VALUATION**

&#x200B;

[Table 5: Overview of comparable companies. All ratios taken from Reuters, on an annual basis.](https://preview.redd.it/x5h2l047yv751.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6526ac85a6e83d489539f2bfcb0c72dfe3f560)

**BKNG** and peers have been reluctant to issue forward guidance. As investors look beyond 2020, 2021 forward earnings will be used to arrive at a current valuation.

&#x200B;

[Table 6: Multiples approach to valuation for BKNG.](https://preview.redd.it/soid9babyv751.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a8851f2a6f8d12c3c7c41de09659effb7fd378)

Current valuation favours a 52.68% 2020 revenue decline and a 2022 recovery. Trading around $1,600 provides little room for error. A decline to sub-$1,400 levels would provide suitable entry.

* **Short-Term** | PT: $1,400 | HOLD.

&#x200B;

[Table 7: DCF approach to valuation for BKNG. Values accurate as of market close, Fri 26th June 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/9uifg0tfyv751.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=16f2ba57b79575930fd31137b2219d6d4c31f5a3)

Notable DCF assumptions are noted:

* **Tax Rate** | Remains at 21%.
* **Risk-free Rate** | 0.70% (US 10Y T-Bill, 19/06/2020).
* [**Perpetual Growth Rate**](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG) | 2.74% (50Y avg. OECD members GDP growth, 1968-2018).
* **Perpetual Operating Margin** | 35.00%, similar to FY2019.

Regardless of the scenario, there is little difference in DCF valuation. Perpetual growth used is conservative given sector growth, and discount rate(s) reflect current market reality. A current share value of below $1,600 seems reasonable, when taking a long-term view on an investment providing an expected annual return of approximately 7.5%.

* **Long-Term** | PT: $1,600 | BUY.

**CONCLUSION**

The “travel bug” is not a Western phenomenon. The continued rise of Asian holidaymakers will solidify this. COVID-19 has rattled tourism and will crush near-term earnings, yet Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) possesses sizable competitive advantages in the following ways:

* Dominant position, globally.
* Respected platforms, and a [proven ability](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/priceline-changes-name-to-booking-ceo-weighs-in.html) to pivot focus to the top performer(s).
* Low-cost, high-margin business model.
* Long-term tailwinds within a resilient sector.
* Strong financial position. Cash balance comfortably covers 2020E expenses. Inorganic growth possible.

**BKNG** has proven to be a well-run business. Despite this, the market has shown its ruthlessness. As such, a 15% pull-back to attractive short-term levels is possible. For the long-term **BKNG** investor, competition will continue to be fierce. Booking Holdings arguably won the battle for the West. Whilst attentions will turn east, they must be careful not to lose focus on “home turf”. In Asia, Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) remains their biggest threat, however in the early stages there will be spoils for all. Lower sector growth is also concern, however unlikely. Yet, investors should take comfort knowing in a scenario where expected perpetual growth halves, **BKNG** remains within the short-term PT. Investors ought to continue loving vacations as much as everyone else.

t3_himf81,"""The end of the 40 year bull market in bonds""","I was recently listening to Masters in Business and Prof Jeremy Siegel was on there touting the namesake of this post. I'm wondering what this sub thinks about this prophecy and if folks here plan to react to this information in some way.


Full disclosure, I myself am an amateur. I have only a basic understanding of how bonds work. However, I've always kept about a third of my portfolio in bonds as the notion of principle protection appealed to me. Are bonds about to lose that quality? Is there another era we can compare today to, such as the 70s (rising interest rates)?


Yields are at all time lows as of 2020. Central banks, the Treasury and Finance Departments around the world are injecting stimulus in the forms of credit and cash straight to business and consumers. Governments should incur record deficits this year.


With the above in mind, especially the last sentence, I can't help but imagine the best way forward in the eyes of government is to attain some higher level of inflation to deflate the real cost of their debts. Obviously central banks are independent of governments in theory. However with fiscal policy directly paying individuals, the lines between fiscal and monetary policy have been blurred in my amateur mind.


I try to stay objective from the news cycle, but this does seem to be uncharted territory for global finance and the world at large. Unfortunately I'm left only with further questions and little in the way of answers. For example, will bonds lose their quality of principle protection? Will rates *necessarily* rise? Should retail investors just plug their ears, close their eyes and 'stay the course?'


The main question I would pose to the group is where can an amateur go to educate themselves on bonds for 2020 and beyond? Are there any authors (such as Fabozzi) you might recommend? Does Siegel have something to gain by pushing the narrative of ""the end of the bull market in bonds?"" Maybe he's writing a book.


What're your thoughts?",6,0.75,1593520136.0
t3_hjihas,Can we discuss non-standard valuation methods? Sometimes used on non-standard assets?,"I am very interested in valuations of different asset classes. We were all taught the **basic valuation methods:**

* Discounted Cash Flow model -  Really only useful for a mature, stable company like a utility or a JNJ.
* Relative Valuation/Current Multiples -  P/E, EV/EBITA, P/FCF, etc.
* Precedent Transactions - The cost companies have paid in the past for comparable companies
* M&A Premiums Analysis – Analyzing M&A deals and figuring out the premium 
that each buyer paid, and using this to establish what your company is worth
* LBO Analysis – Determining how much a PE firm could pay for a company to hit a
target IRR

-----

Then things start to get wonky. Here are some **little less used methods:**

* Dividend Discount Model - stock is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments, discounted back to their present value
* Residual Earnings Model - Useful if the company doesn't have predictable dividends (or none at all
* Future Share Price Analysis – Projecting a company’s share price based on the P/E 
multiples of the public company comparables, then discounting it back to its present
value 
* Real Options on assets such as ""drug patents and mining or oil/natural gas rights""

**For Energy Only:**

* Multiples- P/MCFE, P/MCFE/D (where MCFE = 1 Million Cubic Foot Equivalent, MCFE/D=MCFE per Day), P/NAV

Note from /u/APIglue on using MCFE: ""Don't use MCFE, ever. The BTU ratio is stable, but the price ratio is not, and has never actually been 6:1. You have to value the oil and the gas separately. You should get more granular and value things on a per-field basis (or more) because the per bbl costs and sales price varies so much.""

**For Retail & Airlines Only:**

* Multiples - EV/EBITDAR

----

**Distressed firms:**

* Liquidation Model
* Sometimes you look at valuations on both an assets-only basis and a current liabilities-assumed basis. This distinction exists because you need to make big adjustments to liabilities with distressed companies.
* Valuing Equity as Options 

**Pre-Revenue /Early Stage Companies:**

* Venture Capital Method
* The Dave Berkus Valuation Model
* Bill Payne's Model
* Risk Factor Summation Method
* Replacement Method or ""All-In"" Method
* Rule of Thirds
* Current Value Method - Only used when (a) no material progress has been made on the enterprise’s business
plan, (b) no significant common equity value has been created in the business above the liquidation preference on the preferred shares, and (c) no reasonable basis exists for estimating the amount and timing of any such common equity value above the liquidation preference that might be created in the future
* First Chicago Method

**Private Equity Securities (that have several share classes):**

* Current Value Method (focuses on the current value. Only useful when acquisition/dissolution is imminent)
* Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (PWERM)
* Option Pricing Model (OPM)

--- 

**For REITs only:**

* Public REIT Multiples: P/FFO and P/AFFO
* Net Asset Value (NAV) Model  - Forward NOI/ Cap Rate and add in all their other Assets, subtract their Liabilities, and divide by the share count to get NAV/share
* DCF with Levered FCF (not as common)
* Dividend Discount Model (not as common)

**Real Estate (property level):**

* Replacement Cost method – you estimate how much it would cost to re-construct the property
* Multiples -  NOI/Cap Rate (commercial), $/Sqft (residential)
* Comparables or Comps for residential properties: properties in the same area that have the same sqft, same bed & bath, etc

**Ship/Tanker Assets:**

* Market approach (FMV)
* Replacement cost
* Income approach
* Hamburg rules
* PFandbrief Act

----

These could all be used in a:

* Sum-of-the-parts valuation - Using a combination of the methods above, you break the company into its different P&Ls and value each of them individually. Sometimes in combination with the ""conglomerate discount""


---

Now... can we discuss maybe some even LESS known valuation methods or valuation methods for assets that are not common? How or what is done to value them? For example, I saw a company that pays out people a guarantee for litigation that hasn't happened yet but then they keep all the proceeds if they win. Essentially by pooling a lot of cases together, they can get a confidence interval of the rate of success and value of settlements/awards and then take an arbitrage on that. That is one hella of an alternative asset play imo.

What do you guys got? Any good stories? Any different or weird valuation methods I didn't cover?

t3_hl7svg,Oroco Resource Corp TSXV: OCO," Oroco Resource Corp.

TSXV: OCO.v 

OTC:  ORRCF

Note: This company has been evaluated very thoroughly by others. I am relying heavily on work done by others and linking to this work. I’m not writing a full analysis, just wanted to share an idea.

What is Oroco?

Oroco Resource Corp is a junior mining company based in Canada with majority interest in the Santo Tomas Mine. This is a large Copper porphyry deposit located in Mexico. 

&#x200B;

Junior miners are usually a good way to throw away money,  so why is this one different?  

**Santo Tomas has proven reserves. This is not common.** It was drilled decades ago and samples have been re-assayed multiple times as the mine has gone through various ownership. A typical junior miner needs to prove their reserves. 

&#x200B;

Why does the opportunity exist?  

Many of the world’s desirable copper assets have been developed or acquired by major mining companies in the last two decades. During this time Santo Tomas had been in legal dispute. This is now resolved and Oroco has received majority interest in the project and the mine is registered to a subsidiary.

The second reason is that the information we have on the mine is historical. This means it does not comply with current standards. Once a compliant drilling study (43-101) is complete, the mine will be marketable.

&#x200B;

What am I actually buying?

The company has a detailed Santo Tomas technical report published on their website: [https://orocoresourcecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/ST-DAB-2019Aug22-Revised-2020Apr21-Final-red.pdf](https://orocoresourcecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/ST-DAB-2019Aug22-Revised-2020Apr21-Final-red.pdf)

A few highlights from this report…

* “At a 0.35% CuT cutoff grade, the results show a higher‐grade component of mineralization that consists of 333 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.437% CuT, for a total of 3.20 billion pounds of copper.”  (note: this alone makes  the asset attractive)
* “At a 0.15% CuT cutoff grade, the results show a large historical mineral resource of 822 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.322% CuT, for a total of 5.84 billion contained pounds of copper.”
* Half of the drilled segments ended in ore. Meaning there is more there than was measured.
* The company has purchased land surrounding the original concession.

&#x200B;

What is worth?

Caesar’s report did a nice NPV model: [https://caesarsreport.com/freereports/CaesarsReport\_2019-09-18.pdf](https://caesarsreport.com/freereports/CaesarsReport_2019-09-18.pdf)

At $2.75 copper,  they estimate $1.25 billion NPV. 

At $3 copper, $1.66 billion NPV.

These are estimates based on historical data of course. 

&#x200B;

What’s next?

Continued development of the resource. The company recently finished a private placement. These funds are being used to complete a 3D-IP study of the mine. This data will help characterize existing known deposits and guide future drilling. Drilling will require a further capital raise and be the next step. The company will be most marketable at this point. 

&#x200B;

Pros?

The company trades for $82M CAD. NPV of the mine is at least $1.2B. 

Reserves are clearly under-evaluated. New land acquired and existing holes were not drilled to sufficient depth.

Copper is a long-term play. This mine could last 40 years.

Santo Tomas is close to infrastructure (rail and deep water port). It is in a developed mining district and the country has an incentive to keep this area safe/developed.

&#x200B;

Cons?

The mine is in Sinaloa, Mexico. No reported incidents thus far, but security risk exists.

AMLO has a populist bent and this creates some political risk.

Reserves need to be proven. Although we have the benefit of previous drilling.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts are appreciated.  A full write up of this company would be extremely long and technical.  If interested, Mariusz Skonieczny has done some great work on Oroco over the last couple of years. I recommend starting with his website or his videos on the subject: [http://classicvalueinvestors.com/2020/06/16/oroco-part-1-how-i-learned-about-santo-tomas-copper/](http://classicvalueinvestors.com/2020/06/16/oroco-part-1-how-i-learned-about-santo-tomas-copper/)",29,0.91,1593886202.0

I was wondering if you guys know where I could find these records / figure out how personal bankruptcies have trended for other lenders as well? Specifically focused on LendingClub, Greensky and Credit Acceptance.

t3_hmgabp,Inflation of the early 1980s,"Inflation was very high in the early 80's, and peaked at 14.8% in 1980.

The situation was a bit different than the modern situation, pre-COVID:

1. Inflation of up to 14.8% vs. 1-3%
2. Federal deficit of -2.5% vs -4.6%
3. Trade-weighted dollar positive in both cases
4. Lowest unemployment rate of 5.7% vs. 3.5%

What caused such a drastic difference? We had lower unemployment and a larger deficit pre-COVID, yet inflation just didn't budge and interest rates have continued the post-1980 decline. 

In your view, what contributed to it and are we susceptible to that today? Could it have been foreseen before the issues grew through 1980, or were they just risks that are always present?

t3_hnm5na,Proving corporate innovation is declining in a chart. Ideas?,"Hey everyone. Would appreciate some hive mind input here. The objective is to prove a hypothesis that corporate innovation in the US is declining and the R in corporate R&D spend is effectively being outsourced to VC's. I don't have access to a Bloomberg terminal but here is my idea:

* Get total R&D expense to sales (which I hope is declining over time).
* R&D is rarely broken-out (right?). So to proxy my hypothesis that R is falling relative to corporate sales, we can use M&A activity as % of CFO or something. 
* If M&A activity is increasing but R&D is flattening or falling, we can infer that new R spend is effectively being outsourced to VC's. (i.e. buying up the winners at series-b round)
* Breakout using any of the S&P 500 sector ETFs as whole SP might be wacky. Pharma, for example, will likely look way different (right?)
* There could be one hangup whereby off-balance-sheet corporate VC obscures a trend.

t3_hwynx7,Moat investing simplified: summer project,"I am a college student who is interested in investing and am working on a summer project to make investing, specifically long-term investing in stocks, more accessible to the everyday person.

As part of this project, I wanted to brainstorm and breakdown companies using a simple, systemic framework that is easily understood and digested by beginners while still allowing them to see the bigger picture. It is not to learn about every single detail about a company, but to share/record relevant information for someone to invest for the long-term.

This framework consists of analyzing a company's competitive advantages (moats), potential, risks, and valuation.

This is probably common knowledge to you guys but I'm just going to breakdown the categories for consistency and clarity.

Moats:

* Low-cost producer Ex: Walmart can undercut the prices of local grocery stores because of their efficient supply system and the fact that they buy their products in bulk.
* High Switching Costs: When switching from Apple products to Android products, it is notoriously difficult to transfer files and photos from one device to the other.
* Network Effect: As more people join Facebook, the platform becomes more valuable because users now have more people to connect and interact with.
* Intangible Assets: Brands, (patents, trademarks, and copyrights), government approvals, or a geographic advantage. Ex: Starbucks can charge a high price for its coffee products and thus make lots of profit because they can uphold their brand reputation so effectively.
* Efficient Scale or toll moat: Only a few players can enter a market and be successful. Mastercard's competitors, namely Visa, have no interest in undercutting Mastercard as doing so would only hurt their profits and margins. Instead, they function in a healthy, stable duopoly to preserve their market share and profits. This grants high barriers to entry for any company trying to enter the payment network space.

Potential:

This section is to be filled with various reasons that the company is expected to grow in the foreseeable future. This is great for identifying if a company seems to have the ability to grow for the long haul. Below are various categories/examples of potential:

* Product Potential: If a company can continuously innovate and make revolutionary breakthroughs/innovations in their products. Ex: Tesla's cars are improving every year with better batteries and a self-driving system that makes itself better the more data it acquires.
* Market Potential: If a company can expand its market to new horizons. Ex: The iPhone SE has allowed Apple to start making the iPhone more accessible to the middle class, effectively allowing them to access a new part of the cellular device market due to its lower price point.
* Business Model Potential: Changing the business model to ensure that the company keeps its footing within the industry. Ex: Boeing transitioned from making the majority of their revenue selling aircraft to servicing/repairing them.

Risks:

Various risks go along with any company, and I believe that correctly identifying and evaluating these can make or break whether a company is a worthy long-term investment or not. These risks can be broken up into two distinct categories: external and internal risks. That is, risks that happen outside of a company versus risks that come from within.

A couple of external risk examples include:

* Competition: Samsung went from having 20% marketshare in China vs. 1% in just five years because of the likes of huawei, xiaomi etc.   
* Government Regulations and Restrictions: Since Lockheed-Martin, a private military contractor, has its biggest client as the US government, their revenue that comes internationally can come to a halt it the US government decides to sanction a country that makes up a significant portion of their international revenue.
* Unforeseen Event Risk: COVID-19 has been detrimental to the majority of businesses. AMC theaters, for example, have forced AMC theaters to close all of their theaters until further notice, which has stopped all of their revenue.

A couple of internal risk examples include:

* High Debt: Since AT&T has recently acquired both DirecTV and Time-Warner, they have a high amount of debt (around $160 billion) that will take a substantial amount of time to pay off, and it must be predicted whether or not they will pay it off.
* Concentrated Revenue: Since around 50% of Apple's revenue comes from their iPhone sales, if their sales were greatly reduced, this would be detrimental to the company's revenue.

Valuation: Any methods/metrics that seem relevant plus an approximate margin of safety price

Here is an example of my own breakdown on Apple:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr790iG6U3xQbUJ5sVKYRBXyhTVpQV\_Sdkb5S55LbY0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr790iG6U3xQbUJ5sVKYRBXyhTVpQV_Sdkb5S55LbY0/edit?usp=sharing)

**\*** These categories (especially for potential and risks) are by no means the only ones available, and I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can think up of any other effective categories for any of the four company factors that I listed above. Also, is this system flawed and ineffective, and if so, how and where is it ineffective?**\***

Thank you for reading this far. If you have any questions or if anything is unclear, don't hesitate to ask. I am openly looking for constructive criticism, so any sort of feedback will be extremely helpful. Or if you want to share something similar of your own I would love to get this thread going. :)",46,0.87,1595582428.0
t3_hxo5n4,Has anyone tried to rationalize the stratospheric rise of $TSLA in the past 6 months?,"The company just announced $26B LTM revenue, and $300M LTM profits; it's market cap is $260B. That's 10x P/S and 86x P/E; if you ignore the fact that $400M of that profit was from emission credits (i.e. back them out and it's $100M in-the-hole). 

At the beginning of the year it's share price was $433; today it's $1,417. That's >300%.

In it's latest quarter, it posted revenue growth of -5%, which is very positive news given the circumstances; gross margin of 25% (18% ex-credits; same YoY). Let's assume everything below gross profit is growth CAPEX, i.e. gross margin = net margin. It sold 90,000 cars last quarter, i.e. about 400,000 cars over LTM. Assuming average unit revenue of $69,420, that's about $7B LTM profit, or about 37x P/E. Reasonable enough.

What happened between Jan 1, 2020 and July 24, 2020 to justify a 300% increase in stock price? Coronavirus happened. TSLA managed to sell nearly as many cars as it did last year... how? It's selling durable goods, and durable goods don't sell well in a recession, one that is particularly special this time around since nobody is driving. In end-2019, used car prices were declining, which should mean less new cars sold; so in mid-2020, in the middle of a recession, TSLA is selling... around the same number of cars? Maybe in China where things are back to normal...? I dunno.

What else happened in the last six months? They're building a new factory in Texas, and one more in Germany. Of course they're also building one in China; but everyone already knew that last year. Cybertruck was announced late-2019, so that's not the reason. Youtubers and tech sites have begun reviewing the Model Y... okay let's attribute 100% to that. That leaves another 200% unexplained.

Self-driving? No news since last year, except that the Autopilot alpha build can now drive Elon from his house to work; it was supposed to be Level 5 by now. Tesla Semi? Huh what? Future autonomous taxi network? That was last year's news, so it should have already been in the price. India being the new China? Maybe in 2050, nobody's buying massive quantities of Model Y's in India soon. There has been no revolutionary developments in the EV space in the past 6 months. 

Battery? Solar roof? 

Let's give the benefit of doubt and assume all the above assumptions hold true: the 25% ""net margin"", the fact that revenues barely dipped in the worst auto environment of the past decade, the fact that we are in a freaking recession. Add all that up and it still barely explains why the assumptions in the share price should alter by 300% in 6 months. 

Any guesses? I'm sure I'm missing something.",49,0.89,1595689490.0

**Fundamental analysis of GME**

**Premise:** GME is fundamentally undervalued (at least for the short term) and will reflect it’s true market value upon release of the next generation of xbox and playstation consoles.

**Argument 1:** Stock price is cyclical, tied to the release of new games/consoles. Xbox has released consoles in 2002, 2013, and 2017, and upcoming in Q4 2020. Playstation has released consoles in 1994, 2000,  2006, 2013 and PS5 in Q4 2020. Both companies have released variations of the current brand in between time periods. GME stock value has generally reflected sales during these times. The performance of GME in 2017 onwards is due to - 64.2% revenue over the past 5 years as a result of no new consoles and a trend towards digital games.




**Argument 2:** Pricing of the stock is below market value which was determined by: (Assets - Liabilities)/(outstanding shares) gives us $9.44 a share. Yet GME is currently marked at 4.50 a share.

**Explaining the low pricing:**

GME is currently being priced as if it is headed toward bankruptcy, rather than its intrinsic value. Market sentiment is that brick and mortar has been hammered by the online industry (amazon, ebay etc). The high expectations of of online retail over brick and mortar has caused people to shift resources and attention towards online retail and technology which has resulted in the following:

1) An overvaluation of technological/online companies. For example Intrinsic value of Amazon (based on free cash flow) is 33% lower than it’s current share price. The higher pricing is due to the promise of amazon as an online retailer but amazon unperformed brick and mortar by a large margin for the past decade. 


2) an undervaluation of brick and mortar stores (amazon is currently generating $2 billion in profit, and has had many unprofitable years in the past decade, while walmart has profited $129 billion) in 2019 alone.



3) Pessimism reflected by the market due to covid 19, where the expectation is that brick and mortar will be hit hardest and online will thrive, but over 2/3 of stores were able to continue operating albeit with modified procedures (curbside pickup, online orders). Additionally GME online sales have spiked 1500% during covid. 

4) Low emphasis on stockholders. In the past GME has not put tremendous emphasis on delivering shareholder value. However in recent months Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, both significant investors in GME with 7.3% holding have recently won 2 board seat nominations for Paul Evans and Curtis Wolf, who have promised to redirect efforts towards shareholder value by changing the companies focus on long term performance and by extension unlocking shareholder value. Strategies by management include: reducing costs, shift towards a long term strategy and alignment of compensation with performance, a historically neglected aspect resulting in investor frustration.

I don’t think this is significant, but it is worth noting that management does see value in the company, albeit in the face of significant structural changes.

**Arguments against:**

1) Can GME survive until the December release of consoles?
- yes, they have $500 million in liquidity, and a yearly operating cost of 2 billion, ample to support the store until console releases.

2) will the market reflect GMEs value once sales are up?
Unknown. I’m not certain of this.

3) What advantage does GME offer over walmart and Bestbuy for sales of consoles?

Unknown, GME may have higher pricing than its competitors and a wider assortment of games and accessories. I don’t find this convincing however. See #4

4) Underperformance of console sales. 

There is the potential for consoles to flop, but i don’t think this is viable given the improvements in technology, how long it has been since a new console was released, increasing work from home/stay at home population due to the pandemic and affordable pricing.

Additionally - covid has spiked GME online sales by 1500%, which is a positive sign for the retailers potential. 

Historically, consoles have sold out upon pre-orders becoming available, i think this trend will continue into the next generation of systems.

5) The move to digital:

Digital relies on heavy internet speeds and storage, both practically unavailable right now.

**Conclusion:**

GME is currently under-priced due to a combination of low confidence in management, the expectation that online will take over brick and mortar, historically unfavorable treatment towards shareholders and future expectations of bankruptcy. However intrinsic value of the company is over twice it’s current pricing. The company has enough liquidity to support themselves through the console cycle and bankruptcy fears are unjustified. The company's change in management along with upcoming console release gives the potential for GME to return to its intrinsic value, generate profits and return to a fair market value. I plan to buy GME and hold for up to a year, either until the stock yields a profit or until the end of the console cycle.",25,0.76,1596079721.0

t3_i2fqqb,TZOO - travelzoo,"**TZOO - Travelzoo**

Current Market Cap: 63.9M

Share Price: 5.65

Shares outstanding: 11.5M 

**INTRODUCTION** 

Founded in 1998 by Ralph Bartel, Travelzoo is a niche travel and local deal aggregator/advertiser. The logo appears unchanged since the 1999 internet boom. For two decades, they have published a top 20 list of deals on travelzoo.com. The company works with 2000 companies worldwide and reports approximately 31 million “members”. Members are individuals who are subscribed to their email notification service. 

In early 2020, the company acquired Jack’s flight club, an airline deal notification subscription service. Jack’s is primarily based in the UK, but expansion to the US is being rolled out. The founder’s brother, Holger Bartel, is the current CEO. The company has high insider ownership, relatively low float and a history of share buy-backs. 

**Travelzoo.com**

Travelzoo revenue is derived from paid listings on the top 20 list and other parts of their website. Advertisers include hotels, resorts, airlines, travel agencies, and regional tourism promotion organizations. They also sell vouchers to various hotels and resorts in a similar manner. The clientele is deal motivated. They tend to do well in off-peak seasons and are able to generate demand when better deals are available. International competitors include Secret Escapes in the UK. 

From 2016-2019 revenues have ranged from 106M to 111M and income has ranged from 3.53M to 4.66M. 

*Good co. / Bad co.*

TZOO makes money in the US and Europe and has historically lost money in Asia. The losses from Asia have been hiding a solid US/Europe business. 

2019 Net income of 4.1M included losses of 8.1M attributed to Asia/Pacific. The business ex-Asia produced 12.2M.

**Jacks Flight Club**

A 60% acquisition of Jacks was completed  in early 2020, with an  option to acquire the remainder in January 2021. They are a large player in the flight deal alert industry. They scan flight data for good deals and send these out to members. Free membership is available. Members can also pay $49 a year for premium service which provides more prompt deal notification. The service is for deal motivated individuals, similar to Travelzoo’s core business. 

Several competitors exist in this space. The barrier to entry does not appear particularly high, however the niche has already been swallowed by a few major players (Scotts, Jacks, Dollar flight club, and a few others). A simple breakdown of how these deal services operate from someone creating a local competitor: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bbl35x/how\_and\_why\_im\_taking\_on\_scotts\_cheap\_flights/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bbl35x/how_and_why_im_taking_on_scotts_cheap_flights/)

Jacks has a greater than 80% operating margin. 60% ownership would have contributed 2.2M in earnings. By 2/2020 100K UK travelzoo members signed up for the free service

US rollout happening

**Covid-19 and why is there an opportunity?**

A worldwide pandemic has obviously caused severe adverse effects upon the entire travel industry. Travelzoo’s shares accordingly sold off in March 2020. The founder, Ralph Bartel, also incurred a margin call during this time, which placed further selling pressure on the share price. Shares eventually hit a low of $3.04. Shares have since recovered a bit but remain at prices similar to previous multi-year lows. 

*Bye Bad Co.*

In March 2020, the company swiftly decided to end Asia/Pacific operations. The Japan business was sold to its managing director (with Travelzoo keeping some interest) and the remainder of the Asia/Pacific business was closed. In a normalized environment this would have unlocked tremendous value.

*Now and forward*

The company briefly pivoted to favor favoring sales of refundable vouchers which surpassed expectations. The company holds on to these funds until redemption. The flexibility of the deals has helped uptake despite covid-related uncertainty. Since then, they have returned to a historical balance of advertising and vouchers. 

Revenue has suffered greatly since the onset of the pandemic. Q2 revenue declined to 7M from 26.6M in 2019. Travel fears and restrictions simply limit the amount of people traveling for leisure. Travelzoo has been able to offer tremendous value to its members during this time. Deals to the Maldives, Galapagos islands, and Antarctica have been seen at amazing prices. Most deals extend into 2021 and occasionally beyond. 

Travelzoo has responded to the revenue decline with impressive cost cutting measures. A large portion of the company’s expenses are related to selling/marketing and Travelzoo has been able to react quickly.  Furthermore, they have used this opportunity for structural improvements. CEO Holger Bartel recently stated that ongoing operating expenses are expected to be \~60M ( \~88M in 2019) with the ability to support normalized revenue. Cash balance has increased to 27M, partially due to increased voucher sales. They expect return to profitability by end of fiscal year 2020.

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Value realization will occur with travel normalization and if the company is able to return to pre-covid business. Expect a sooner return to travel amongst Travelzoo’s deal focused customers, however full return is unlikely before 2022. Many deals will continue to be available to Travelzoo customers, as destinations are eager for customers. Pent up demand should help as well. Balance sheet is very manageable.

I will use a value with a simple multiple of earnings calculation. Historic P/E has averaged 14. We can use a P/E of 10 for safety.

2019 income, simply excluding Asia/Pacific = 12.2M.  P/E of 10 = 122M valuation. 

*(share price = $10.6)*

Full acquisition of Jacks = + 3M in earnings. 15.2M.  P/E of 10 = 152M valuation.

*(share price = $13.2)*

(Potential growth for Jacks is not taken into account. This could add real value. However, we should also assume near term impairment. )

Cost cutting of 28M is a large unknown. If this is sustainable, the potential is upside enormous. 45M. P/E of 10 = 450M valuation.

*(share price = $39)*

**Conclusion**

Travelzoo revenue is down and shares have sold off. Several structural changes have since occurred, including closure of the money losing Asian business and significant structural cost-cutting. These changes alone should unlock tremendous value. However, this is all masked by the overhanging Covid-19 situation which limits travel. Until this resolves, it is a waiting game.",16,0.92,1596388757.0

t3_i6k3ic,Why the Teladoc-Livongo Merger Makes Sense,"I'm going to use this article by Richard Chu of Saga Partners as a jumping-off point:  [https://richardchu97.substack.com/p/teladoc-and-livongo-a-merger-that](https://richardchu97.substack.com/p/teladoc-and-livongo-a-merger-that) 

Basically, the short version of his bullish thesis for the Teladoc-Livongo merger is that it will disrupt the healthcare industry, which is currently built around **treating** diseases (particularly acute diseases); by using new technology to significantly reduce overall healthcare costs, through: 

\- prioritizing **preventing** diseases before they become serious (pre-medicine) VS treating them after they become serious, and 

\- online direct-to-consumer treatment (tele-medicine) VS physical visits to the doctor

The general idea is that preventative care is much cheaper for the overall healthcare system than treatment care, as suggested by the recent shift in regulation to favor Value-Based-Care (VBS) over Fee-For-Service (FFS). And as the pandemic has accelerated the shift to online, tele-medicine will also see more rapid adoption than previously anticipated. 

The merged entity will in general command total market share of the pre-medicine and tele-medicine sector, which means that as the heathcare sector shifts towards these two developments, ""Tela-vongo"" might start to have more bargaining power over existing healthcare players (hospitals and insurance companies), and be able to usurp healthcare market share. 

Anyway you can read his excellent article for the longform business rationale. I'm just going to focus on the financial aspects of the merger, and why I think it makes sense. 

&#x200B;

[Teladoc summarized financials 2015-post acq](https://preview.redd.it/q3qfbkogezf51.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0d400cd95089dd798443a73ef43d1d51c94f29a)

I'm using pre-2020 numbers so as to measure performance on a pre-coronavirus (normalized) basis. As Teladoc has never been profitable pre-2020, I'm using Revenue Growth as the barometer for performance. As we can see, Revenue Growth has generally outpaced Expense Growth, meaning that it has been doing quite alright on the performance front. 

However, Teladoc achieved this growth through making acquisitions rather than organically, i.e. a roll-up strategy. Hence, ROE or ROIC would be a more objective metric to measure performance. However, as Teladoc has never been profitable since listing, I have opted to use RevOE (Revenue on Equity) and RevOIC (Revenue on Invested Capital) as a crude proxy for ROE/ROIC. 

As we can see, RevOE and RevOIC have both hovered around the 20%-30% range for the past 5 years, which at the very least implies that their acquisitions haven't yet been value-destructive. However, immediately post-merger the new entity's RevOE (and RevOIC, assuming all existing debt paid off) will drop to 7%. That means, for the RevOE to return to the pre-merger level of 36%, it will have to grow revenues to $6.576B, or 5x (495%) current post-merger revenues. 

With the business rationale explained by Richard Chu above, I think 5x is feasible over the long-term. And that is before incorporating other bullish assumptions like scale advantages, which should improve ROE at a faster rate than RevOE. Any revenue growth beyond that would imply that the merger is value-accretive. 

Please keep in mind that I have relied entirely on secondary sources for this back-of-the-envelope financial analysis, and have not yet done thorough research. I hope others who have more insight into the merger can contribute more than I have.",26,0.79,1596982821.0

t3_i81riz,Power REIT -- Stock analysis and Value Investors Club application,"This is my Value Investors Club application on Power REIT. Tell me what you think.

Power REIT is a real estate trust with investments in solar, railroad, and newly in medical cannabis greenhouses.

**Thesis**:Power REIT (PW) is the best way to invest in the cannabis area without the traditionally binary hit or miss nature of emerging industries.PW is anchored by a portfolio of traditional properties allowing it to more safely and at lower cost invest in cannabis assets.PW earns a return on invested capital (ROIC) in great excess of the cost of capital. Return of 12%-19% in new properties, recently issued bonds at 4.62%.PW is under valued despite a seemingly rich market price because of probable massive increase in revenue, earnings, and funds from operation (FFO).The margin of safety is significant.

**Significant Assets**:6 Controlled Environment Agriculture greenhouse facilities aggregating over 131,00 square feet7 solar farm ground leases totaling 601 acres112 miles of railroad propertyApprox. $10 mil. cash

**Significant Liabilities**:Approx. $24 mil. Long term debt at interest rates less than or equal to 5%Major debt: $15,500,000 at 4.62% fully amortizing, maturing in 2054Maturities as follows:2021 $635,5022022 $675,3742023 $1,168,2972024 $715,7772025+ $21,208,698Preferred stock: 144,636 shares of 7.75% Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, at $25.

**General info**:Power REIT is currently pursuing investment in what they call controlled environment agriculture or CEA, essentially greenhouses. PW seeks out strictly medical cannabis producers who for whatever reason need additional financing, they then purchase the real estate they own and lease it back to them, and at times help with financing of construction. PW is one of the few ways for cannabis producing companies to get any sort of financing as federally it is still illegal and banks are weary. This gives PW lots of negotiating power in deal making, and that is why they can for example, buy and finance a 5.2 acre CEA property in southern Colorado for around $1 Mil. and get a straight lined rent of $192,000 equating to around a 19% FFO yield.

These properties and tenants are of greater quality than the typical cannabis operation, remember they require tenants to maintain a medical cannabis producers license in the lease. That is a key for PW, this is not a speculative cannabis play that is dependent on federal legalization, on the contrary, a lease they have in a Maine property includes the clause that states that ""After the deferred-rent period, rent is structured to provide a 12.9% return based on the original invested capital amount with annual rent increases of 3% rate per annum. At any time after year six, if cannabis is legalized at the federal level, the rent will be readjusted down to an amount equal to a 9% return on the original invested capital amount and will increase at a 3% rate per annum based on a starting date of the start of year seven."" PW is partly a play against the federal legalization.

**On the topic of debt:**A company with a market cap of under $50 mil with about $24 mil in debt might seem a little risky, but here is where the stability from the solar and rail assets comes in. Their existing FFO from those two asset classes is a little over $1 mil while the debt payments with exception of 2023 don't exceed $1 mil for the foreseeable future. So as long as they don't issue new debt in an uncharacteristically bad way PW will have no solvency issues.

**Management:**Management is skill-full. The CEO David Lesser is pretty much for all intents and purposes the whole company, he is the sole full time employee. He is excellent in terms of real estate expertise. It is very clear he knows his stuff. He has a long history in real estate and more specifically in renewable/clean energy real estate. Lesser is also the chairman of the board, and the largest shareholder. He gets paid exclusively in various forms of equity. His interests are aligned with owners interests. Insider ownership is around 30%, very high for a REIT.

Lesser is also key on avoiding share dilution as stated, and in practice unlike many REITs. There have been no share dilutions besides management's compensation plan. The major recent financing was the 2019 bond issuance.

**Relative Pricing**For this section I will refer to Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) another publicly listed REIT that invests in cannabis assets. IIPR invests in a wider range of assets like retail not just CEA. I am much more suspicious of IIPR's real estate and management. There have been many questions raised about the quality of real estate and solvency of tenants. The CEO seems sleazy and they constantly dilute shareholders. I think PW is superior in terms of intangibles and tangibles. IIPR is PW only publicly traded comparable.

IIPR has grown FFO per share 133% for the MRQ YoY. PW has grown FFO per share 107% over the same time. PW only started investing in high return CEA in late 2019, and engage in more conservative financing, so the difference in growth rates is marginal.

IIPR is currently being priced at around 19.1 times forward 12 months FFO.PW is priced at only 14 times forward 12 months FFO. (If management's most basic expectations are met)In terms of relative price PW, if it sold at the 19.1 multiple it would be selling for $32.4 which I still think could yield an above market rate of return over time.

**Valuation**I believe PW to be the type of business that the market undervalues because of high uncertainty but low risk. The high uncertainty comes from not knowing how much management will want to grow and raise capital, will management continue to use safe amounts of leverage, will new financing options become available to cannabis companies etc. The low risk comes from the fact that PW has very low risk of going to 0 or even decreasing substantially in share price because of the current safety in investment return and diversification. I'll put a floor as to what I think a low risk price is. Let's say base case scenario over the next year PW invests the existing $10 mil. in cash at a yield of 12.5% (below the usual yield of around 18%), doesn't raise any additional capital, and lease payments are collected and debts paid as scheduled. PW FFO per share would be about $0.45 per quarter. If they trade at an P/FFO multiple of 20 (PW currently trades at 27) that makes the price $36 per share. However, I do think capital will be raised, management has expressed interest in doing so. In that case the strong ROIC and high cash flow would give PW a high ceiling to grow as far as macroeconomic and market conditions allow.

## Catalyst

Share price increases when new real estate acquisitions are announced. Eventual dividend. PW currently pays no dividend because the preferred has satisfied the REIT return of capital requirement recently, however with income rising 100%. It is likely a dividend will be coming soon and that will attract more attention. Continued performance and time.

t3_i8moov,Turnaround play: Hostelworld Group (HSW.L),"Hey guys, last month I did a deep-dive into Booking Holdings (BKNG) so for August I wanted to follow this up with another, smaller OTA: Hostelworld Group.

N.B. I have gone long on HSW this past week.

This subreddit is always a goldmine for excellent questions, debate and feedback so any 2-cents given would be fantastic.

# SUMMARY

A lesser known online travel agency (“OTA”) in comparison to my last article on Booking Holdings (**BKNG**), hostel focussed Hostelworld (**HSW**) faces numerous challenges that have resulted in its valuation collapsing from \~£400M in 2018 to \~£70M in August 2020. Their strategy to reinvigorate growth; dividend cuts; and present uncertainty in the travel & tourism sector has investors displeased. Yet, a solid balance sheet ensures their survival of COVID-19; favourable sector tailwinds; and a current valuation pricing their new strategy for failure mean Hostelworld provides an alluring prospect against considerable competitive risks.

# CURRENT PREDICAMENT

**COVID-19**

When assessing Hostelworld’s current woes, let’s mention the elephant in the room first. An updated version of a visualisation shown in my previous article shows tourism is recovering sooner than anticipated. Yet remember, booking volumes are typically [seasonal](https://supercontrol.co.uk/the-bottom-line-on-bookings).

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: YTD \(Jan-Jul\) recovery in online traffic of select accommodation providers. Source: Author, based on data from similarweb.com](https://preview.redd.it/g3ye0rvf4rg51.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=07b2fe86a651910d42ce20ed147f1bcb107f0f9a)

Inevitably, HSW will underperform generalist, large OTAs. Hostels’ typically young, adventurous travellers may prove un-budging, but limited social distancing measures will inhibit a rebound compared to hotels or house-shares. Across 1H 2020, traffic declined 73.16%. Despite the 2H being better, this conservative figure is used in later assumptions.

**BUSINESS WOES / CHANGE IN STRATEGY**

[Figure 2: Recent underperformance of HSW. Source: Author, based on HSW financials.](https://preview.redd.it/lh3xnzom1ng51.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=442999ad3644bef8fa05eaca9713de66b7d64425)

COVID-19 follows a 2018 strategic shake-up, including a complete management overhaul. To shareholders’ disappointment, HSW is yet to reap rewards from its “[roadmap for growth](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/hostelworld-cmd-rns-final-28-11-2018.pdf)” – such initiatives rarely yield instant results. At least we finally understand their direction. Traditionally, OTAs provide a centralised platform, allowing hostel goers and hostel providers access to a fragmented market. HSW aims to expand inorganically into hostel management services.

As management states in their [2019 annual report](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/interactive-annual-report-2019.pdf):

>“Taken together, [Goki](https://goki.travel/) \[who provide automated check-in/locking solutions\] and [Counter](https://counter.app/) \[who provide booking/payment management solutions\] will help Hostelworld re-establish itself not only as an OTA/distributor with hostels, but also as a leading provider of low-cost hostel focussed technology solutions to the hostel industry”.

This strategy appears customer-centric. Hostel providers will appreciate fee reductions and efforts to improve the hostel experience; encouraging preferential listings. This is a good move, yet it does not address low switching costs for hostel goers. Q4 2019 and 2020 were earmarked as the beginning of HSW’s return to growth. Doubtless, this has been significantly derailed. Contrary, COVID-19 may provide an adoption tailwind for Backpack Online (Hostelworld’s management services unit), as hostels look to reduce costs and encourage traveller confidence.

Regardless, the ambiguity of their goals does not fill one with confidence of their execution. The “roadmap for growth” may be a good idea, but until there’s concrete evidence of its opportunity then it remains merely a ‘Call Option’.

**INVESTORS LOSE PATIENCE**

This echoes investors’ frustrations as HSW has sank \~85%, which can be better understood through a historical lens. Hostelworld was controlled by [private equity](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/about-us/company-history) from 2009-2015. An established OTA is an alluring proposition for a PE firm, due to its consistent cash-flows. Hostelworld has [cancelled its dividend](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/hostelworld-cancels-dividend-as-it-counts-coronavirus-cost-1.4212750) policy. Thus, investors valuing HSW for its operating cash flows have left. A lack of top-line growth as well as shareholder remuneration explains a lack of demand for HSW equity.

# FUTURE POSTIVE/NEGATIVE CATALYSTS

**REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL: TAILWINDS**

Despite its origins in early 20th century Germany, hostelling is still an emerging industry. Early hostels were never considered profitable until open-source booking management software and OTAs emerged – incidentally, Hostelworld pioneered both. Now, “[you’re charging 4-star rates and you’re offering a 2-star service, which is what makes it so profitable](https://skift.com/2018/11/12/the-big-money-reinvention-of-the-humble-hostel-a-skift-deep-dive/)”. Hostelling is expected to grow [7-8% annually](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/transactions/targeting-millennials-investors-see-value-hostel-market); much higher than hotelling at [4.6% annually](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/03/08/1750501/0/en/Global-Hotels-Market-Expected-To-Reach-USD-211-54-Billion-By-2025-Zion-Market-Research.html). This growth is attributed to burgeoning travel demand among young, ‘lifestyle’ travellers. Resultantly hoteliers, upstarts and investors have flocked. Hoteliers such as Marriott (**MAR**) and Accor (**AC.EPA**) have expanded their “budget” offerings. Simultaneously hostel chains (unheard of 20 years ago), backed by private equity, have emerged. Hostels now compete with hotels, as the observable differences lessen. Large, generalist OTAs – a la BKNG – benefit most, by offering all options to frugal travellers. Due to their niche, HSW can never compete on scale. Differentiation is therefore the strategy of HSW and operators.

Concerning OTAs specifically, they have enjoyed trends towards online booking methods – [87%](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/the-evolution-of-the-hostel-traveller-v1.pdf) of hostel bookings are now made online. “Will the subsector grow?” is arguably the incorrect question; “will Hostelworld be the primary beneficiary?” better captures concerns of its weakening competitive position.

**REASONS TO BE CAUTIOUS: COMPETITION**

It should be noted HSW is the dominant hostel-focussed OTA, having [acquired](https://www.phocuswire.com/Massive-consolidation-HostelWorld-buys-HostelBookers) main rival HostelBookers in 2013. Despite this, HSW faces competition from many angles: namely large OTAs (BKNG, **EXPE**, etc.) and hostels’ own platforms. As mentioned, OTAs covering multiple accommodation types have an advantage over Hostelworld. When considering [travellers’ preferences when booking](https://www.statista.com/chart/19224/travel-tech-benefits/), large OTAs “gives me more options”. “Saves money” is another top preference, which is best attained when booking direct. Further qualitative insight can be found on this [r/solotravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/go0tsn/do_you_book_toursactivities_with_an_online/) thread. Quantitatively, net bookings (Figure 2) have stagnated. A minor return to bookings growth in [Q4 2019](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/2019-prelims-presentation.pdf) cannot be given much credence, yet arguably an 85% decline in valuation is a tad extreme. Overall, it is difficult to pinpoint what advantage Hostelworld has. Low switching costs are concerning, particularly since many travellers appear to use the platforms to browse but opt to book direct – to support hostels and attain cheaper prices. This train of thought vindicates their redirection.

&#x200B;

[Figure 3: QoQ bookings across HSW platforms. Source: HSW 2019 preliminary presentation.](https://preview.redd.it/1yoyx49f2ng51.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=28396dab2d964e36343beadbf5afeddf0eaa7bd2)

# VALUATION

Analysts identify [competition](https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/914293/hostelworld-falls-out-of-bed-as-it-warns-coronavirus-could-wipe-4mln-off-first-quarter-earnings-914293.html) as a key risk also. Failure to deliver their “roadmap for growth” will cause HSW to further succumb to competitive pressures. In 2020, HSW will comfortably survive, thanks to zero debt and a current ratio of 2.02 on current assets totalling €24M or \~35% of its current valuation ([2019A figures](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/interactive-annual-report-2019.pdf)). Beyond is more uncertain.

Revenue assumptions largely drive this DCF valuation. If HSW simply recovers 2019 revenues – based on 2019 P/S ratio – then investors would receive a 16.61% annual return. In a “Bear” scenario, CAGR is 9.41%. A significantly higher valuation could be seen in the “Bull” scenario, driven by higher revenue growth and a possible P/S re-rating.

Regardless of which scenario occurs, HSW trades in a range which aligns with the fundamentals. To minimise risk, HSW is attractive at a 21.45% return below 58 GBp.

To test the robustness of the DCF assumptions a final valuation, a comparison against implied LT and “LT growth rate”, presents a fair value estimate of 56 GBp.

# CONCLUSION

A minnow in the OTA-space, Hostelworld is undoubtedly a business with many challenges and unanswered questions. Recent [director dealings](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/default.aspx?tab=5&vw=dd&SecurityToken=0P00016X9N%5D3%5D0%5DE0WWE%24%24ALL&Id=0P00016X9N&ClientFund=0&CurrencyId=BAS) are notable, though recovery of tailwinds within ‘Travel & Tourism’ are crucial. Here, a recovery is probable but turnaround of its gradually weakening competitive position is still dubious. Doubling-down on its niche position as a hostel services provider is appropriate but success is also dubious. Yet, HSW trades at a valuation where, even if 2019As sales are never recovered or strategic ambitions are never realised, it presents an attractive opportunity for those will to take the risk.",27,0.82,1597267758.0

t3_i8ticy,Emmis Communications,"Hi, I'm new to this and looking for feedback to improve. I wrote this about two months ago at lower prices, but it hasn't gone up that much. It's a deep value pitch on limited information of business in transition. Whatever feedback you have to help someone new(ish) would be great.

**Summary**

Emmis paid $75 million in March for a mature business, Lencore Acoustics. In addition, Emmis owns $14 million of real estate, gets $8 million annually from Disney, still owns several radio stations in Indianapolis and New York and should collect a $5 million receivable in the next 3 months.

Emmis has an adjusted enterprise value of $19 million.

We don’t have enough information to really value Lencore, but there is enough to know that Lencore probably has positive cash flow material to Emmis. 

Along with the other assets, we have enough information to know there is a very significant disparity between price and value at the moment.

There are some warts too which is why the opportunity exists.

**What is Emmis**

Emmis Communications is a microcap old media company controlled by the CEO that has been selling its media assets for some time. It has disappointed investors hoping it was a liquidation play by using most of the cash to acquire Lencore, a privately-held manufacturer of sound masking machines for offices and privacy sensitive locations. It delisted from a major exchange.

There are a lot of issues: management circle of competence, governance, excessive pay and bloated corporate overhead, delisting and going dark, and how little is known about the acquired business. This is why the opportunity exists.

**History**

Beginning almost 10 years ago, Emmis management started to recognize that traditional broadcast and print assets weren’t that great. But the realization was slow.

The first stage of the transition was to add supposedly complementary businesses that would grow faster than broadcast and print media. Think radio apps. During this stage they also continued to add radio stations (though some print businesses were sold).

That didn’t really work. Next there was a long divestment phase culminating in the spin-off of MediaCo and the sale of the Austin radio stations last year. Note that as a result of these transactions, trailing EPS and revenue are not particularly useful to analyzing current Emmis.

Finally, there was the acquisition of a non-media business, Lencore Acoustics, a few months ago.

Three times in the past 14 years the CEO, Jeff Smulyan, has offered to take the company private, most recently in 2016. Emmis is such a different company now from the most recent attempt in 2016 that I don’t think the valuation of his 2016 offer matters. 

**Lencore**

Emmis acquired Lencore Acoustics for $75 million in March. Lencore also owned an mass notification SMS business that was not acquired. The SMS business seems to have been a small part of Lencore overall.

Lencore sells sound masking solutions to government and enterprise customers. These systems are more sophisticated than they sound. The individual appliances are networked and can be controlled centrally. They work together and are tuned to make spaces quieter to the human ear.

We don’t know more than we know about this business. Lencore was privately held and Emmis has released barely any financial information about it: just the working capital that was acquired in the deal. We have some information on what Emmis was looking for during its search. We also know something about Lencore’s clients. We know how it does relative to competitors in federal contracting. We know a few other details. All of these things point to a mature, stable business with cash flow that’s material to Emmis’s valuation.

You can’t value Lencore with this information. But Emmis doesn’t have to go into the too hard bucket as long as we can conclude Lencore is probably worth a significant fraction of its purchase price.

Let’s start with what Emmis was looking for while it was shopping for a business to buy.

Jeff Smulyan was asked on the July 2019 earnings call what he was looking for in terms of an acquisition:

Q: Are there any parameters for target businesses that you can share?

A: Well, I think, certainly I think it's size. I think businesses with probably $10 million to $25 million of cash flow. That would be probably the target size. Again that's -- I think we don't want startups. I think we've seen a lot of startups, we've done some startups, but I think we would really like to find businesses that are up and running that are mature where we think we see something that might make them a little bit better.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-emms-earnings-conference-173628404.html

Emmis disclosed that the $75.1 million purchase price included $5.3 million of working capital. If Lencore had 90 days of working capital, that would mean $22 million of sales. 45 days would be $42 million of sales.

Emmis’s business development VP publicly posted on LinkedIn during the search that Emmis was seeking businesses with 25% margins. 25% is as good a number to use as any for an exercise this imprecise. That gets us to an EBITDA range of $5.5 to $10.5 million, or an EV/EBITDA range for the sale price of roughly 7 to 13. This looks a bit expensive but not implausible for a mature business.

In other words, Emmis overpaying somewhat for Lencore is baked into the analysis.

We have a few other data points as well. It is not a lot but still something. 

Lencore has been in the sound masking business since 1990. It has survived several business cycles and has 33 employees. It lists 20+ Fortune 500 companies, 20+ large healthcare systems and 20+ federal government clients on its website.

Federal contract data shows sales on par with competitor Cambridge Sound and above other competitors. While the actual sales numbers to the federal government are not material, it is evidence of how Lencore performs in its industry.

It is hiring sales staff. (Relevant because of COVID-19)

This is not enough to properly value Lencore. We do not have financials, we cannot know maintenance capex, growth rates, etc.

But I do think it is enough to say that Lencore is likely worth something material relative to Emmis’s current enterprise value.

**Enterprise Value Adjustments**

Let’s look at the enterprise value first. As I said, this requires some adjustments from the most recent quarter.

First, since we know Emmis spent $75.1 million in cash on Lencore and $3.1 million on transaction fees, we should subtract that from the MRQ cash. This moves that cash on the balance sheet to $14.8 million from $93 million. 

Long term debt and operating leases are $65.5 million on the balance sheet. $44.1 million of this is non-recourse to Emmis and its subsidiaries. Therefore, adjusted debt is $21.4 million. 

Emmis’s financials consolidate an ESPN radio station in NYC that Disney operates and finances. The debt is Disney’s economically, and there is also $1 million of restricted cash on the asset side that is Disney’s economically which I have excluded from Emmis’s cash. There is also a smaller amount of non-recourse debt related to the failed Digonex entity that I exclude.

One final adjustment is that Emmis deposited $8 million in cash as collateral with the mortgage lender that lent against the headquarters. This was done to allow Emmis to divest some of its assets that were otherwise securing the mortgage and also to reduce the interest rate on the mortgage.

The cash collateral is on the balance sheet as a non-current asset. It’s reasonable to offset the cash collateral with the mortgage itself to establish net debt. This brings the adjusted debt to $13.4 million. Note that the cash collateral is not cash on the balance sheet, so this is not double-counted.

Emmis’s current market cap is $20.8 million, so my EV after adjustments is $19.4 million. (20.8+13.4-14.8)

Non-Lencore Assets & Corporate Overhead

In addition to Lencore, the company has a variety of assets:

* Headquarters building: assessed at $15.4 million. Applying a 20% discount: $12.3 million
* 70 acres in an Indianapolis suburb: using comparable sales, estimated $2.1 million. Discount 30% to $1.5m
* Disney contract that pays $8.3 million/year through 2024. NPV with a 3% discount rate: $31.8 million
* $6.5 million MediaCo receivable guaranteed for $5 million by Standard General, due in August: $5 million
* Residual value of the NY FM station after Disney lease expires in 2024. I halved the Disney payment and applied a 5 multiple and then discounted to the present. $17 million. This probably underestimates the value since Disney will want to renew the contract or else its NYC listeners will have to find ESPN on the dial somewhere else.
* NY AM station. Book value after impairment is $6.6 million. Even though WABC was recently sold for $12.5 million, I am going to cut the book value in half to $3.3 million.
* Indianapolis stations. Some FM stations in markets smaller than Indianapolis have sold during COVID-19 for $750,000. Valuing each Indianapolis station at this price, I get $3.75 million. Book value is $15 million after impairment for comparison.
* MediaCo convertible note: $0. MediaCo is over-levered and probably insolvent. However, there is upside here if Standard General is willing to put in more money to save MediaCo from the senior lenders.
* MediaCo management fee: $0.
* Magazine business: $0

I get a total value for other assets of $75.25 million even with some conservative or even draconian assumptions. At this EV, it doesn’t have to be spot on. What is important is whether these assets, conservatively valued, provide an ample margin of safety and reward on the current EV. I am least confident in my value for the radio stations, but there is still a significant margin of safety even if they are worth nothing.

Any valuation would be unrealistic of course without factoring in the $18 million spent last year in corporate overhead. This is very high for a company of this size. On the plus side, this should decline due to the delisting and two arguably one-off items.

Delisting should save $1-2 million per year. The supposedly one-off items are $0.8 of fees related to the Lencore transaction and $6 million of additional executive bonuses for completing the divestment strategy. 

I am skeptical about the bonuses being exceptional. However, these adjustments bring corporate expense to $10-11 million, which was the previous fiscal year’s number and still high for a company this size. It seems reasonable to believe the company can get back to the $10-11 million level.

**Management**

Management and the board own 22% of the company. Jeff Smulyan controls the company through a special share class. They could choose to loot the company into oblivion. That, combined with the negative story on radio, forced selling from delisting, and COVID-19’s effect on advertising is why the stock is cheap.

My biggest worry in researching Emmis was whether management just blew up $75 million. My second biggest worry was that they would continue to do things like that. 

But after looking at their capital allocation record, I think they have been about average and not terrible. Certainly management has made capital allocation mistakes in the past ten years, especially trying to be venture capitalists and incubators for radio-related technologies.

But some credit is due for getting out of the print and radio business at decent valuations and using the proceeds to delever. For instance, MediaCo’s assets do not look like they are worth the $90 million Emmis got paid for them. Some credit is also due for pulling the plug on the startups and ceasing that strategy altogether. A lot of capital is destroyed by sheer stubbornness and they didn't make that mistake forever.

So, management got some decisions right: get out of the media and print business and get the debt off the balance sheet. 

**Valuation**

In my base case, Lencore was not stupid, and things will work out for shareholders buying in at this level even without additional catalysts like asset sales or closing the remaining loss making businesses (though obviously that would help). The corporate overhead declines to $12 million/year, Lencore adds $7 million EBIT in 2021, Emmis collects the $5 million owed by MediaCo and gets 1 year of the management fee for another $1.5 million. In this scenario, Emmis will burn a small amount of cash and have net assets (less non-recourse debt) of more than $60 million. An EV of half net assets does not seem like a big hurdle and that implies adding $17 million to the current market capitalization of $20.8 million.

In the modest bull case where some of the non-Lencore assets are sold for post COVID prices and corporate expenses decline from imperial to merely decadent, Emmis is a multibagger. How much? I can’t say, but 2, 3, 4x are possible depending on the degree of cost savings and asset sales. 

For example, if expense at the corporate level returns to $10 million/year, one of the major assets is sold (headquarters or the NY FM station) and Lencore earns $7 million, Emmis would have $3 million in EBIT and perhaps have $20 or 30 million in net cash. In this case, valuing the cash at face value and the rest of the non-Lencore assets at half face value, we get $60 million. That is a triple in the equity from the current EV.

The downside is limited given that debt is less than cash, the hard assets on the balance sheet relative to the enterprise value, and a controlling shareholder and CEO who has shown a willingness and the means to take the company private. 

The bear case is some combination of Lencore turning out to not be worth much and continued very high corporate overhead. It is possible that this turns out to be a value trap. 

However, this idea does have time to realize value. Even at last year’s cash burn (ie, the scenario where Lencore generates no cash and expenses remain extremely high), there are over 4 years before the non-Lencore assets net of debt would be diminished beyond the current market cap.

The margin of safety provided by assets plus Lencore should be sufficient for this to work out in the next few years, especially with multiple potential catalysts: a management led buyout, additional disclosure about Lencore, sales of some of the remaining assets, or even a re-listing on a major exchange. 

One final note about COVID-19 risk: I know that the world is different than when it was when the deal closed, but I am comforted that Lencore is still hiring sales staff. Combined with our margin of safety, I don’t think COVID-19 is a significant risk to the thesis.",14,0.79,1597293547.0

t3_i9cqqt,Quick Take on Xeris Pharma (XERS),"Disclaimer: I am LONG equity. Please do due diligence. This is based off of 60 minutes of quick analysis.

**Company Overview**

Xeris is a spec pharma company founded in 2005. Their primary scope of work involves developed injectable and infusible drugs.

**2019-Present: Product Launch**

Their first product was approved in September 2019, called Gvoke. It is a PFS and auto-injector that has glucagon, to treat severe hypoglycemia. This is market as two different products: Gvoke PFS (Nov 2019) and Gvoke HypoPen (July 2020).

&#x200B;

[Gvoke Hypopen](https://preview.redd.it/1e9osz3sjvg51.jpg?width=648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a6216df6c5000cf4f981c5b18bafa9ae0e1ad60)

**Competition**

Primary competition comes from tradition glucagon kits and Eli Lilly’s BAQSIMI.

BAQSIMI is delivered via the Nasal passage. Legacy kits are traditional syringe injections. Xeris has the advantage with both a PFS and auto-injector, which traditionally are well received with patients.

&#x200B;

[BAQSIMI](https://preview.redd.it/2i1zurqijvg51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84fa07d3396c6836344e2a74a09cf76eba96b0f9)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financials**

The most popular product will most likely be the two-pack hypopen (auto-injector). This carries an AWP of $673.92. For adults, the prescription is 1mg/0.2mL. (BAQSIMI cost is similar with 3 mg dosage, and legacy kits from LLY cost \~$280/kit)

&#x200B;

[Gvoke Micromedex](https://preview.redd.it/nbe7tnaljvg51.jpg?width=717&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85337a91e43f0d7306df87c3fb1a9b7742f0ea16)

&#x200B;

One overhang with Xeris’ financials is their long-term debt, which has increased from $58.3M YE19 to $109.5M 2Q20. However, principal payments do not start until 2022, and interest expenses should be below $10M for the year. Xeris should be generating enough FCF over the next two years to service their debt.

**Valuation Takeaways**

· Peak sales of \~$250M

· WACC @ 11%

· Positive EBITDA by 2026

All information available online is all their marketing narration. I hope someone here will be able to help me get a better idea about this.

1.  What federal regulation does this come under?

Is it legal to collect money from public and not be traded on a stock exchange? What are safeguards?
2. How can I verify their appraisal process? How reliable and conflict-free is it? Any idea is welcomed. They said that they get the majority of their appraisals from the Winston art group. I read a lot online that appraisals can sometimes be sketchy.

t3_idjqw7,Agora $API Write-Up: Hypergrowth Chinese Twilio,"A simple way to describe Agora is it’s like a Chinese Twilio focused on video, and more specifically live streaming (which Twilio does not do). Although many are understandably hesitant about Chinese companies, my confidence is a bit higher in this one given founder and CEO Tony Zhao’s history of working in the US (he was a founding engineer at WebEx), that Agora has dual headquarters in China and the US and only expanded to China a year after it was founded, their impressive customer list with giants like Xiaomi and ByteDance, and some famous investors like Coatue that reportedly decided to invest after just two weeks.

I’ve written a deep dive on it on my Substack where I provide an overview of its platform, customers, competition, market opportunity, financials, and risks. I'm long Agora in my personal portfolio and it's a company I'm really excited about as it has most of the criteria I look for in a potential multi-bagger: hypergrowth, category leader with a defensible moat, large and fast-growing TAM with high optionality, small market cap (under $5B), strong margins, and visionary management (Tony pioneered Real-Time Engagement).

My Agora thesis also ties in with the future I see for Twilio and Zoom, and I go over it in the market opportunity section. Namely, I believe we will see the gradual commoditization of video which will lead to the unbundling of Zoom. Here’s a nice quote by JJ Oslund, whose article I reference: “Companies like Zoom that achieve massive growth and ubiquity lose one important competitive advantage: the ability to focus on a particular user… Zoom has become the lowest common denominator that works for everyone, yet it is not perfectly suited for anyone.”

ZM has already made significant inroads into education and telehealth but there is significant opportunity to chip away at their moat by focusing on serving specific user needs. The real competition isn’t WebEx, Meet, etc, it's the 250+ companies carving out their own verticals. “The endpoint for the verticalization of Zoom will be a no-code tool that gives users the power to design highly custom video apps for their particular needs.” And that's exactly what Agora is building.

The other part of my thesis, which may be of interest to Twilio owners, is that I believe some revolutionary businesses will be ideated in the current environment. Some of the greatest innovations came during periods of the greatest turmoil and with the advent of the API economy, companies like Twilio and Agora are well-positioned to help the new wave of start-ups, such as the ones that are competing against Zoom, scale up fast. In my opinion, the most exciting vertical for Twilio is healthcare. They became HIPAA compliant in February, and they've since seen more than a 100 percent increase in active healthcare customers using its video product. I think as traditional healthcare systems digitize then TWLO can do really well here even though this vertical is non-material to their growth right now. This plays into my TDOC thesis that I’ve outlined in previous blog posts.

t3_ieoouu,Long Thesis - 10x Genomics (TXG) - Towards a comprehensive view of biology,"**Intro:**

I would like to start sharing my long thesis on biotech companies, genomics in particular, from the perspective of someone that works in the field.  A little about myself - I have a B.S. in Bioengineering and M.S. in Bioinformatics and work as a Computational Biologist in academic oncology research.  I do not and have not worked for 10x Genomics.  I'm an amateur when it comes to security analysis and am approaching investing by capitalizing on trends I see in my own field of work and having worked directly or indirectly with the technologies in question.  I hope my unique insights may be beneficial and look forward to learning from others.  

**What do they do and why does it matter:**

10x Genomics provides technology to sequence DNA in individual cells as opposed to sequencing DNA from a bulk sample.  Standard practice involves collecting a tissue sample, mashing it up, and sequencing the extracted DNA as a whole.  Now imagine collecting that same tissue sample, separating out each individual cell, and sequencing the DNA from each cell.  This then provides the researcher a with a window into the cellular micro-environment.  Essentially aiding in answering the question of what cell type is doing what and where.  This kind of information in invaluable and could lead to the development of novel therapeutics and new avenues of inquiry. 

The initial product offered by TXG is their ""Chromium System"" that allows for the single cell sequencing mentioned above.  The most recent product is their ""Visium Technology"" which, in addition to the information described above, provides spatial data on the cellular environment.  This means that not only can you obtain information about what's going on in each cell, you can obtain information about WHERE it is happening.

**Financial case for TXG and notes from Q2 call:**

In an attempt to become a better financial analyst I've studied many of the investor materials on the 10x Genomics website.  This includes listening to the most recent Q2 conference call, reviewing uploaded presentations, and studying SEC filings.  From the financial point of view yearly revenues continue to increase and I expect the company to become profitable as early as 2021.  Debt levels appear to be reasonable and decreasing.  The main revenue streams are instrument sales and consumables in the form of reagents required to run the machines.

Notes I considered important from Q2 call:

\- Continue to see strong demand for TXG products despite covid pandemic

\- 60% of labs using TXG technology returned to operation through the summer post covid shutdown

\- Potential for NIH (National Institute of Health) to increase funding for research in general due to covid which could boost demand for TXG technology

\- Increase in patent filings and approval

**Competition:**

Given my unique perspective ""single cell sequencing"" and ""10x Genomics"" are practically synonymous in the field and many researchers aren't even aware of competition to TXG.  With that being said, Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) offers a competing but inferior product (I've never seen anyone actually use it personally or in a publication).  Additionally, Becton Dickinson (BDX) offers similar technology which I don't hear much about.  However, TXG's CEO Serge Saxonov complemented BDX's single cell sequencing technology at the [UBS Genomics 2.0 and Medtech Innovations Virtual Summit](https://investors.10xgenomics.com/events/event-details/ubs-genomics-20-and-medtech-innovations-virtual-summit).

**Final case:**

My case is built upon my perspective in the field and I see that single cell sequencing is booming which is backed up by the 1200+ peer reviewed publications since 2016 that use TXG technology.  This number is increasing yearly and I see the trend accelerating especially with the new Visium technology.  TXG technology is increasingly used in industry for therapeutic development as well is in academia for research.  Having worked with data produced by TXG technology and having insight into how their customers view the product I see TXG continuing growth for the next several years at least.

Again, I want to point out that my case relies upon being familiar with trends in research and the product.  The financial analysis is amateur and secondary (would love feedback on anything I missed in the financials of the company itself).  Please feel free to ask any questions or provide any feedback.",67,0.89,1598124315.0
t3_ifssz3,"Long Thesis - Progyny - 100% upside - High-growth, profitable company is the only differentiated provider in a large, growing, and underserved market. PGNY’s high-touch, seamless offering helps them stand out against large insurance carriers."," [Link to my research report on PGNY](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AlTlXddn_yjSiWIdrL9GO_GdBfse?e=owulbT)

  

**Summary**

High-growth, profitable company is the only differentiated provider in a large, growing, and underserved market. PGNY’s high-touch, seamless offering helps them stand out against large insurance carriers. Covid-19 has shown the importance of benefits for employees and will continue to be the key differentiator for those thinking of changing jobs. According to RMANJ (Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey), 68% of people would switch jobs for fertility benefits.

For employers, Progyny reduces costs by including the latest cutting-edge technology in one packaged price, thereby lowering the risk of multiples and increasing the likelihood of pregnancy, keeping employees happy with an integrated, data-driven, concierge service partnering with a selective group of fertility doctors. 

Upside potential is 2x current price in the next 18 months. 

**Overview**

Progyny Inc. (Nasdaq: PGNY), “PGNY” or the “Company”, based in New York, NY, is the leading independent fertility and family building benefits manager. Progyny serves as a value-add benefits manager sold to employers who want to improve their benefits coverage and retain and attract the best employees. Progyny offers a comprehensive solution and is truly disrupting the fertility industry.

There is no standard fertility cycle, but the below is a good approximation of possible workflows:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7aip8pna9zi51.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ef868a67eae10534bac254ab58fb3d4295aef37

1. Patient is referred to fertility center for evaluation for Assisted Reproductive Technology (“ART”) procedures, including in-vitro fertilization (“IVF “) and intrauterine insemination (“IUI”). Both can be aided by pharmaceuticals that stimulate egg production in the female patient. IVF involves the fertilization of the egg and sperm in the lab, while IUI is direct injection of the sperm sample into the uterus. Often, IUI is done first as it is less expensive. As success rates of IVF have increased, IUI utilization will likely fall.

2. Sperm washing is the separation of the sperm from the semen sample for embryo creation, and it enhances the freezing capacity of the sperm. Typically, a wash solution is added to the sample and then a centrifuge is used to undergo separation. This is done in both IUI and IVF.

3. Some OB/GYN platforms are pursuing vertical integration and offering fertility services directly. The OB would need to be credentialed at the lab / procedure center. 

4. Specialty pharmacy arranges delivery of temperature sensitive Rx. Drug regimens include ovarian stimulation to increase the number of eggs or hormone manipulation to better time fertility cycles, among others.

5. Oocyte retrieval / aspiration is done under deep-sedation anesthesia in a procedure room, typically in the attached IVF lab. Transfer cycle implantation is done using ultrasound guidance without anesthesia. (Anecdotally, we have been told that only REIs can perform an egg retrieval. We have not been able to validate this).

6. Many clinics house frozen embryos on-site, while some clinics contract with 3rd parties to manage the process. During an IVF cycle, embryos are created from all available eggs. Single-embryo transfer (“SET”) is becoming the norm, which means that multiple embryos are then cryopreserved to use in the future. A fertility preservation cycle ends here with a female storing eggs for long-term usage (e.g. a woman in her young 20s deciding to freeze her eggs for starting a family later).

7. Common nomenclature refers to an IVF cycle or an IVF cycle with Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (“ICSI”). From a technical perspective, ICSI and IVF are different forms of embryo fertilization within an ART cycle.

8. ART clinics are frequently offering ancillary services such as embryo / egg adoption or surrogacy services. More frequently, there are independent companies that help with the adoption process and finding surrogates.

9. ART procedures are broken into two different types of cycles: a banking cycle is the process by which eggs are gathered, embryos are created and then transferred to cryopreservation. A transfer cycle is typically the transfer of a thawed embryo to the female for potential pregnancy. If a pregnancy does not occur, another transfer cycle ensues. Many REIs are moving towards a banking cycle, freezing all embryos, then transfer cycles until embryos are exhausted or a birth occurs. If a birth occurs with the first embryo, patients can keep their embryos for future pregnancy attempts, donate the embryos to a donation center, or request the destruction of the embryos. 

The Company started as Auxogen Biosciences, an egg-freezing provider before changing business models to focus on providing a full-range of fertility benefits. In 2016, they launched with their first 5 employer clients and 110,000 members. As of June 30, 2020, the Company provided benefits to 134 employers and \~2.2 million members, year over year growth of 63%. 134 employers is less than 2% of the total addressable market of “approximately 8,000 self-insured employers in the United States (excluding quasi-governmental entities, such as universities and school systems, and labor unions) who have a minimum of 1,000 employees and represent approximately 69 million potential covered lives in total. Our current member base of 2.1 million represents only 3% of our total market opportunity.”

The utilization rate for all Progyny members was less than 1% in 2019, offering significant leverageable upside as the topic of fertility becomes less taboo.

Fertility has historically been a process fraught one-sided knowledge, even more so than the typical physician procedure. Despite the increased availability of information on the internet, women who undergo fertility treatments have often described the experience as “byzantine” and “chaotic”. Outdated treatment models without the latest technology (or the latest tech offered as expensive a la carte options) continue to be the norm at traditional insurance providers as well as clinics that do not accept insurance. Progyny’s differentiated approach, including a high-touch concierge level of service for patients and data-driven decision making at the clinical level, has led to an NPS of 72 for fertility benefits and 80 for the integrated, optional pharmacy benefit. 

Typically, fertility benefits offered by large insurance carriers are add-ons to existing coverage subject to a lifetime maximum while simultaneously requiring physicians to try IUI 3 – 6 times before authorizing IVF. The success rate of IUI, also known as artificial insemination, is typically less than 10%, even when performed with medication. As mentioned in Progyny’s IPO “A patient with mandated fertility step therapy protocol may be required to undergo three to six cycles of IUI, which has an average success rate range of 5% to 15%, takes place over three to six months and can cost up to $4,000 per cycle (or an aggregate of approximately $12,000 to $24,000), according to FertilityIQ. Multiple rounds of mandated IUI is likely to exhaust the patient's lifetime dollar maximum fertility benefits and waste valuable time before more effective IVF treatment can be begun.” 

**Success Rates for IVF** 

IVF success rates vary greatly by age but were 49% on average for women younger than 35. The graph below shows success rates by all clinics by age group for those that did at least 10 cycles in the specific age group. As an example, for those in the ages 35 – 37, out of 456 available clinics, 425 performed at least 10 cycles with a median success rate of 39.7%.

Progyny’s Smart Cycle is the proprietary method the company has chosen as a “currency” for fertility benefits. As opposed to a traditional fee-for-service model with step-up methods, employers may choose to provide between 2 and unlimited Smart Cycles to employees. This enables employees to choose the provider’s best method. Included in the Smart Cycle, and another indicator of the Company’s forward-thinking methodology, are treatment options that deliver better outcomes (PGS, ICSI, multiple embryo freezing with future implantations). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/np577a389zi51.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=c061a2b24c8515890ba204479b4677893dabf755

As detailed in the chart above, a patient could undergo an IVF cycle that freezes all embryos (3/4 of a Smart Cycle), then transfer 5 frozen embryos (1/4 cycle each; each transfer would occur at peak ovulation, which would take at least 5 months) and use only 2 Smart Cycles. Alternatively, if the patient froze all embryos and got pregnant on the first embryo transfer, they would only use one cycle. 

Before advances in vitrification (freezing), patients could not be sure that an embryo created in the lab and frozen for later use would be viable, so using only one embryo at a time seemed wasteful. Now, as freezing technology has advanced, undergoing one pharmaceutical regime, one oocyte collection procedure, creating as many embryos as possible, and then transferring one embryo back into the uterus while freezing the rest provides the highest ROI. If the first transferred embryo fails to implant or otherwise does not lead to a baby, the patient can simply thaw the next embryo and try implantation again next month. 

Included in each Smart Cycle is pre-implantation genetic sequencing (“PGS”) on all available embryos and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (“ICSI”). PGS uses next-generation sequencing technology to determine the viability and sex of the embryo while ICSI is a process whereby a sperm is directly inserted into the egg to start fertilization, rather than allowing the sperm to penetrate the egg naturally. ICSI has a slightly higher rate of successful fertilization (as opposed to simply leaving the egg and sperm in the petri dish). 

Because Progyny’s experience is denominated in cycles of care, not simply dollars, patients and doctors can focus on what procedures offer the best return. 30% of the Company’s existing network of doctors do not accept insurance of any kind, other than Progyny, which speaks to the value that is provided to doctors and employers.

For patients not looking to get pregnant, Progyny offers egg freezing as well. Progyny started as an egg-freezing manager, which allows a woman to preserve her fertility and manage her biological clock. As mentioned previously, pregnancy outcomes vary significantly and align closely with the age of the egg. Egg freezing is designed to allow a woman to save her younger eggs until she is ready to start a family. From an employer’s perspective, keeping younger women in the work force for longer is a cost savings. Vitrification technology has improved significantly since “Freeze your eggs, Free Your Career” was the headline on Bloomberg Businesweek in 2014, but we still don’t yet know the pregnancy rates for women who froze their eggs 5 years ago, but early results are promising and on par with IVF rates for women of similar ages now. 

From a female perspective, the egg freezing process is not an easy one. The patient is still required to inject themselves with stimulation drugs and the egg retrieval process is the same as in the IVF process (under sedation). The same number of days out of work are required. Using the SmartCycle benefit above as an example, the egg freezing process would require ½ of a Smart Cycle. The annual payment required to the clinic is typically included in the benefits package but may require out-of-pocket expenses covered by the employee. 

Contrary to popular belief, IVF pregnancies do not have a higher rate of multiples (twins, triplets, etc.), rather in order to reduce out of pocket costs, REIs have transferred multiple embryos to the patient, in the hopes of achieving a pregnancy. If you have struggled for years to get pregnant, and the doctor is suggesting that transferring 3 embryos at once is your best chance at success, you are unlikely to complain, nor are you likely to selectively eliminate an implanted embryo because you now have twins. There are several factors that are making it more likely / acceptable to transfer one embryo at a time, enabling Progyny’s success.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/48vk9gc69zi51.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c75a2771a1dd9a079074331b317451f076725ca

From the Company: “According to a study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology that analyzed the total costs of care over 400,000 deliveries between 2005 and 2010, as adjusted for inflation, the maternity and perinatal healthcare costs attributable to a set of twins are approximately $150,000 on average, more than four times the comparable costs attributable to singleton births of approximately $35,000, and often exceed this average. In the case of triplets, the costs escalate significantly and average $560,000, sometimes extending upwards of $1.0 million.”

“Progyny's selective network of high-quality fertility specialists consistently demonstrate a strong adherence to best practices with a substantially higher single embryo transfer rate. As a result, our members experience significantly fewer pregnancies with multiples (e.g., twins or triplets). Multiples are associated with a higher probability of adverse medical conditions for the mother and babies, and as a byproduct, significantly escalate the costs for employers. Our IVF multiples rate is 3.6% compared to the national average of 16.1%. A lower multiples rate is the primary means to achieving lower high-risk maternity and NICU expenses for our clients.” 

An educated and supported patient leads to better outcomes. Each patient gets a patient care advocate who interacts with a patient, on average, 15x during their usage of fertility benefits - before treatment, during treatment and post-pregnancy. The Company provides phone-based clinical education and support seven days a week and the Company’s proprietary “UnPack It” call allows patients to speak to a licensed pharmacy clinician who describes the medications included in the package (which contains an average of 20 items per cycle), provides instruction on proper medication administration, and ensures that cycles start on time. The Company’s single medication authorization and delivery led to no missed or delayed cycles in 2018.

Previous conference calls have made note of the fact that the Company would like to purchase their own specialty pharmacy and own every aspect of that interaction, which should provide a lift to gross margins. This would allow PGNY to manage both the medication and the treatment, leading to decreased cost of fertility drugs. Under larger carrier programs, carriers manage access to treatment, but PBM manages access to medications, which can lead to a delay in cycle commencement. 

Progyny Rx can only be added to the Progyny fertility benefits solution (not offered without subscription to base fertility benefits) and offers patients a potentially lower cost fertility drug benefit, while streamlining what is often a frustrating part of the consumer experience. The Progyny Rx solution reduces dispensing and delivery times and eliminates the possibility that a cycle does not start on time due to a specialty pharmacy not delivering medication. Progyny bills employers for fertility medication as it is dispensed in accordance with the individual Smart Cycle contract. Progyny Rx was introduced in 2018 and represented only 5% of total revenue in 2018. By June 30, 2020, Progyny Rx represented 28% of total revenue and increased 15% y/y. The growth rate should slow and move more in line with the fertility benefits solution as the existing customer base adds it to their package. 

Progyny Rx can save employers 5% on spend for typical carrier fertility benefits or 21% of the drug spend. Prior authorization is not required, and the pre-screened network of specialty pharmacies can deliver within 48 hours. Additionally, PGNY has 1-year contracts, as opposed to 3 – 5 years like standard PBMs, but with guaranteed minimums, allowing them to purchase at discounts and pass part of the savings on to employers – another reason the attachment rate is so high. 

**Large, Underpenetrated Addressable Market**

Total cycle counts are increasing (below, in 000s), including both freezing cycles and intended-pregnancy cycles. Acceleration in cycle volume is likely driven by a declining birth rate as women wait later in life to start a family, resulting in reduced fertility, as well as the number of non-traditional (LGBT and single parents). Conservatively, we believe cycles can double in the next 8 years, a 7% CAGR. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6y7jb559zi51.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cc5cdde7c6583d8e943d2675ad3b6ae85f818de

Progyny believes its addressable market is the $6.7B spent on infertility treatments in 2017, but these numbers could easily understate the available market and potential patients as over 50% of people in the US who are diagnosed as infertile do not seek treatment. Additionally, according to the Company, 35% of its covered universe did not previously have fertility benefits in place previously, meaning there is a growing population of people who are now considering their fertility options. According to Willis Towers, Watson, \~ 55% of employers offered fertility benefits in 2018. 

A quick review of CDC stats and FertilityIQ shows a significant disparity in outcomes and emotions for those who are seeking treatment. While technology in the embryo lab is improving rapidly and success rates between clinics should be converging, there continue to be significant outliers. Clinics that follow what are now generally accepted procedures (follicle stimulating hormones, a 5-day incubation period and PGS to determine embryo viability) have seen success rates of at least 40%. There continue to be several providers that offer a mini-IVF cycle or natural IVF cycle. Designed to appeal to cost conscious cash payors, the on average $5,000 costs, is simply IVF without prescription drugs or any add-ons such as PGS. However, the success rates are on par with IUI and there is an abundance of patients over 40 using the service, where the success rates are already low. Additionally, success stories at these clinics frequently align with what is perceived as the worst parts of the process:

One clinic offering a natural cycle IVF has a rating at FertilityIQ of \~8.0 with 60% of people strongly recommending it. This clinic performed 2,000 cycles in 2018 (the most recently available data from the CDC), making it one of the top 10 most active fertility center in the US. Their success rate for women under 35 was 23%, as opposed to the national average of 50% for all clinics. For women over 43, the average success rate for the most active 40 clinics in this demographic was 5.0% this clinics success rate was 0.4%. The lower success rate is likely due to the lack of pre-cycle drugs and PGS, but the success rate and the average rating is hard to understand. Part of this could be to the customer service provided by the clinic, or the perceived benefit of having to go into the office less often for check-ups when not doing a medication driven cycle. 

. 

Reviews from other clinics with high average customer ratings, but low success rates include:

\- “start of a journey that consisted of multiple IUI’s with numerous medications, but they were not successful.” 

\- After an IVF retrieval, the couple had two viable embryos, both were transferred the next month”

\- “The couple started with a series of IUI treatments, three in total that were not successful.” 

\- “After a fresh transfer of two embryos, again another unsuccessful cycle”.

\- “He suggested transferring 2 due to higher implantation rates, but there is increased rate of twins “

Progyny’s comps have typically been other high-growth companies that went public in the last two years: 1Life Healthcare (ONEM), Accolade (ACCD), Health Catalyst (HCAT), Health Equity (HQY), Livongo (LVGO), Phreesia (PHR), as well as Teladoc (TDOC). Despite revenue growth that outpaces these companies, PGNY’s revenue multiple of 4.4x 2021E revenue is a 40% discount to the peer group median. PNGY’s lower gross margin is likely limiting the multiple. However, Progyny is the one of the few profitable companies in this group and the only one with realistic EBTIDA margins. SG&A leverage is the most likely driver of increased EBITDA and can be achieved by utilizing data to improve clinical outcomes in the future, but primarily by increased productive of the sales reps, including larger employer wins and larger employee utilization.

Perhaps the best direct comp is Bright Horizons (BFAM). BFAM offers childcare as a healthcare benefit where employees can use pre-tax dollars to pay for childcare. BFAM offers both onsite childcare centers built to the employer’s specification (owned by the employer and operated by BFAM), as well as shared-site locations that are open to the public and back-up sitter services. Currently, PGNY is trading at 4.4x 2021E Revenue, in-line with BFAM’s 4.3x multiple. I would argue that PGNY should trade significantly higher given the asset-lite business model and higher ROIC. 

**Recent Results**

Post Covid-19, fertility treatments came back faster than anticipated, combined with disciplined operations, PGNY drove revenue and EBITDA above 2Q2020 consensus estimates. Utilization is still below historical levels, but management’s visibility led to excellent FY21 revenue estimates (consensus is around $555M, a y/y increase of 62%. 

2Q2020 revenue increased 15% to $64.6M, and EBITDA increased 18% to $6.5M, primarily driven by SBC as the 15% revenue was not enough to leverage the additional G&A people hired in the last 18 months. The end of the quarter as fertility docs opened their offices back up for remote visits saw better operating margin. 

Despite the shutdown in fertility clinics during COVID-19, Progyny was able to successfully add several clients. 

“The significant majority of the clinics in our network chose to adhere to ASRMs guidelines, and our volume of fertility treatments and dispensing of the related medications declined significantly over the latter part of the quarter. . . Through the end of March and into the first half of April, we saw significant reductions in the utilization of the benefit by our members down to as low as 15%, when compared to the early part of Q1 were 15% of what we consider to be normal levels. In April, the New York Department of Health declared that fertility is an essential health service and stated that clinics have the authority to treat their patients and perform procedures during the pandemic. Then on April 24, ASRM updated its guidelines which were reaffirmed on May 11, advising that practices could reopen for all procedures so long as it could be done in a measured way that is safe for patients and staff.”

Revenue increased by $33.8 million, 72% in 1Q2020. This increase is primarily due to a $19.0 million, or 47% increase, in revenue from fertility benefits. Additionally, the Company experienced a $14.8 million or 216% increase in revenue from specialty pharmacy. Revenue growth was due to the increase in the number of clients and covered lives. Progyny Rx revenue growth outpaced the fertility benefits revenue since Progyny Rx went live with only a select number of clients on January 1, 2018 and has continued to add both new and existing fertility benefit solution clients since its initial launch. 

**Competition**

The only true competition is the large insurance companies, but, as mentioned previously, they are not delivering care the same way.  WINFertility is the largest manager of fertility insurance benefits on behalf of Anthem, Aetna and Cigna and are not directly involved in the delivery of care. Carrot is a Silicon Valley startup that recently raised $24M in a Series B with several brand name customers (StitchFix, Slack) where they focus on negotiating discounts at fertility clinics for their customers, who then use after-tax dollars from their employers. 

**Risks to Thesis**

Though there is risk a large carrier may switch to a model similar to Progyny’s, I believe it is unlikely given the established relationships with REIs at the clinic level, the difficulty of managing a more selective network of providers, and the lack of 

interest shown previously in eliminating the IUI. It is more likely a carrier would acquire Progyny first.",110,0.96,1598288045.0

 As you can se they had a Pre-tax loss of 4,840 from their operating activities but then when i go down i see the Resturcuting and Impairment charges, which have a added benefit of 5,047 resulting into the company actually making a profit this quarter.

t3_iig6qv,Auto Loans in COVID,"Auto loan delinquencies seem to have been high before COVID hit. The NY Fed household survey showed that 5% of auto loans were 90+ days delinquent in 2020 Q1, and just slightly lower in 2019 Q4. By comparison, this figure was 2.5% in the middle of 2007, before the recession. 

In the previous crisis, auto loan delinquencies seem to have soured in lock step with rising unemployment rates. This time, it seems they soured ahead of the economy or unemployment rates.

Does anyone have a view on why these won't get worse as the effects of COVID's unemployment are felt? Is Federal stimulus enough to prevent loan delinquencies? Is there more trouble ahead?

t3_ii5c3s,Question about Graham Number considering MFGP and AMD,"Hi all,

I am **very** new to security analysis and just came across Graham Number which says you can consider investing in a company if P/E \* P/BV < 22.5 given a large market cap.

I was looking at some stocks for an example and came across two different worlds.

&#x200B;

* MFGP which currently has P/E=1.03 and P/BV=0.21, with a large market cap. Which seems insane according to this heuristic formula, but all the advisors advising sell until recently and stock price trending down.
* AMD which currently has P/E=166.6 and P/BV=29.72, with a large market cap. Which seems also insane on the other end of the spectrum, but advisors are advising buy and stock is breaking record prices.

My question is why is there such a discrepency? It seems to me like if MFGP should be very safe to invest in even if they fail considering their P/BV, whereas for AMD, even if they 10folded their earnings next year, would be a bad stock for current price.

t3_ik60ts,JP Morgan: Analysis,"I recently did a valuation analysis on JPM using a DDM. The valuation is contingent on certain macroeconomic factors with assumptions such as;

1. The Fed will keep interest rates at zero for the next 5 years 
2. Congress will almost certainly continue passing stimulus bills going forward as there are still cash flow problems due to COVID-19
3. JPM will not cut its dividend under almost any circumstance as they have one of the highest CET1 capital reserves of $191 billion, acting as a buffer protecting the dividend.
4. JPM will return to a normalized ROE and payout ratio when the economy has recovered, but faces slow growth in the future due to very low interest rates and high household & corporate debt levels.

Given the following assumptions, I created 3 scenarios involving a base case, a fast recovery, and a slow recovery. The valuation determines that JPM is worth $133.63

Gold has been doing good lately and considering the last bullish run it had, it could go on for 3 years. I did a bit a research and tumbled upon [GoldSpot Discoveries Corp.](https://goldspot.ca/) (TSXV:SPOT)

# What Are They Doing?

GoldSpot is a small Canadian company that was created not so long ago on the premise that the use of unutilized geological, geophysical and satellite imagery big data combined with machine learning/artificial intelligence can change the way exploration on a property is done. The goal  is to drive down prices of exploration and offer a simpler way to identify where to mine, but also to elevate the accuracy of metals locations in the ground.You get the idea...I won't get into much details, but if you want more information on the company, [go ahead!](https://goldspot.ca/about-us/) Oh and by the way, don't be fool by the name, the company is also engaged in other metals too (Silver, Nickel, Copper, etc...).

# tl;dr

SPOT is trading at $0.03 over its cash per share metric of $0.10 which is ridiculous considering the ways the company can generate income. With its advances in technology, multiple income stream and its promising portfolio of investments, I believe the company is undervalued by a factor of at least 3. My current estimation of share price is at $0.43 although current market value is $0.14.

# Why the price has gone down and Escrow Shares

If you take a look at SPOT's chart there is a descending trend although it seems somewhat correlated to the fact that the stock took a couple hits...A look up at trading volumes shines a light on 6 different periods. 4 of them are related to the release of escrow shares to the investors under the following schedule:

At those times there is usually an important volume of shares being liquidated... The fifth peak in volume is in October 2019 and it can be attributed to investor *Sheldon Inwentash* liquidating a couple millions of shares. Last but not least, last peak that happened about a week ago on August 13th...I am not sure why this happened. Maybe a change in escrow shares release schedule or not, it is yet to be determined.

# Royalties

From what I understood, GoldSpot is primarily doing consulting, but they still seem to make moves on mining projects that look promising. They have royalties portfolios on these 4 properties:

* **New Found Gold Corp** (TSXV:NFG): Net smelter of 0.5%. Consisting of 70,000 hectares in the very prospective project Queensway (19 metres of 92.86 g/t gold, 6 metres of 285.2 g/t gold).
* **Pacton Gold** (TSXV:PAC): 0.5% net smelter. The project is in Red Lake area, Ontario which is close to Great Bear Ressources (TSXV:GBR) who are having tremendous success.
* **One Bullion** : 0.25% net smelter with their lands in South Africa
* **Manitou Gold** (TSXV:MTU): 0.25% net smelter.

New Found Gold is by far the most valuable asset in the portfolio. While digging in the news release I found that GoldSpot previously owned  [1% royalty in Queensway](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/48296/GoldSpot-Discoveries-Provides-Corporate-and-Royalties-Update), so they probably sold 0.5% along the way and with [NFG IPO](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/11/2076427/0/en/New-Found-Gold-Completes-Initial-Public-Offering.html) they probably sold it at a good price. It is hard to price the royalty portfolio because there is no working mine or good resource estimation for there junior miners but with the recent [Gold rally](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/) they didn't go down in value.

# Investments

The bulk of this thesis come from SPOT's investments in some key junior miners. The whole portfolio is not available but from what was publicly disclose, it is possible to assume that these undisclosed assets (investments) are related to mining (why invest elsewhere when you are expert in the industry). With the price of gold going up, these anonymous investments probably surfed the wave along with it. But we can still look at what we know for certain:

* **New Found Gold (TSXV:NFG)**: GoldSpot invested $750,000 in New Found Gold around the [4th of March 2019](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-announces-acquisition-of-royalties-in-two-prolific-districts-covering-over-900000-hectares-and-closing-of-strategic-partnership-with-manitou-gold/#:~:text=GoldSpot's%20royalty%20on%20New%20Found%20Gold's%20project%20is%20over%20~70%2C000%20hectares.&text=Under%20the%20terms%20of%20the,for%20gross%20proceeds%20of%20%2475%2C000). Looking at New Found Gold statements, *On June 18 2019, the company completed a private placement of 1,875,000 Shares at a price of $0.40 for gross proceeds of $750,000*. NFG price as of the time of writting this is [$1.83](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA860CA860&sxsrf=ALeKk02rhg01PwGu5Ed4GkKaxTnC0FTNeg:1598574312912&q=CVE:+NFG&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDbPTC4zLLCwteRaxcjiHuVop-Lm5AwBQAQo0SAAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiXp8Ww0bzrAhWpc98KHR_5CZAQsRUwEXoECA0QAw&biw=2048&bih=1010) taking SPOT's stake to around 3.4 million.
* **NV Gold Corp (TSXV:NVX)**: Their investment more than doubled (now \~1.4 million from 500k), we can read this information from their [CEO's interview](https://www.caesarsreport.com/reports/interview-with-peter-ball-ceo-of-nv-gold/).

Considering only these two investments from their $10M in assets (non-public probably rose as well), their portfolio rose by \~22% since last available financial information. Over the same period, GoldSpot lost \~40% (0.25 to 0.14) taking the capitalization to just under $14M when they have at least $13.35M in assets (adjusting for the gains in NVX and NFG).

# Insiders

One of the reason why the stock is so low can be attributed to a change in management. Frank Holmes (U.S. Global), Donovan Pollitt (Pollitt Mining) and Ramon Barua (Hochschild Mining) [left the company](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-provides-corporate-update/). This would suggest something bad was about to happen for GoldSpot or maybe a divergence of views within the board committee. Since the announcement none of them withdrew ownership in SPOT suggesting it might be more the latter reason. Though, a flow of new deals for GoldSpot indicate they can do it without the three board members [NV Gold](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-enters-into-strategic-data-royalty-relationship-with-nv-gold/), [Yamana](https://goldspot.ca/news/yamana-gold-reengages-goldspot-discoveries-for-its-cerro-moro-gold-and-silver-mine-in-argentina/), [AEX Gold](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-and-aex-gold-inc-sign-an-agreement-to-identify-new-exploration-targets-in-south-greenland/), [Margaux](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-and-margaux-resources-ltd-collaborate-on-series-of-exciting-new-targets-for-drill-campaign/), [Tembo Gold](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-to-apply-machine-learning-on-tanzanian-greenstone-belt/).

# Discounted Cash Flow

## What is known

## Consulting Income

One relation that caught my eye is the one between the Consulting Income and the Operating, G&A expenses, that for the moment, are pretty much on par. Looking at the company's past 9 quarters, the consulting income grew somewhat in a straight line at 15% QoQ and looking at the same metric year over year we saw in 2019 a growth rate of 78% YoY. When looking at the Operating and G&A costs, it grew at around 17% QoQ. The operating costs are slightly greater then the consulting incomes, but it could easily be explained by the *surprise* cost of inclusion on the Canadian exchange of about $2M in Q1 of 2019. This is a one time fee that can be ignored for estimating future cash flows.

Since their ideal long term goal is that with the continuous effort put in by the employees, the cost for providing these consulting services will diminish drastically in the future. The assumption goes towards decreasing Operating and G&A expenses and increasing Consulting Incomes.

## Investment Gains

Based on the limited information online about their private portfolio of assets, the two *known* recent investments made in NFG and NVG, initially valued at $1.25M are now estimated at $3.5M as of FY 2020.

## Assumptions

## Growth Rates

Using the data gathered from the company's historical information the following table was made to estimate the future growth of the incomes and costs of the company. Based on the the fact that the company leverages technology, that they've been working at this for 2 and a half years, that they have many projects in their pipeline, and promising Q1 2020 results, the same 80% growth rate between 2018-2019 was used for estimating 2020's results. The rate was subsequently cut in half each year. Terminal perpetual growth rate is set to 3%.

Operating G&A costs modeled at a more modest rate to support the main thesis.

## Projected Income

The investment gains were modeled based on the known information for the year 2020 and used that number for the following years. Assuming there is little known about GoldSpot's portfolio, the fact that royalties will pay for a long time, and their many projects, netting $3.5M over the next 3 years is reasonable. The average gold run also last 3 years. After the investment gains was divided by 2.

&#x200B;

## Results

To discount the future cashflow at the present value the following parameters were used. GoldSpot doesn't have much debt and they finance most of the company through equity. Estimating the cost of equity with warrants is tricky and I decided to use a strong 10% to penalize the valuation. Tax rate is given by the government of Canada's website.

 

|Name|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Discount Rate|10%|
|n\_shares|94,724,876|
|Price|0.14|
|Tax rate|9%|

 

Using the cashflow generated in the last table, we added back the small D&A of 21,555 yearly back in the FCFF. Nothing else was added to the FCFF due to the limited amount of information on the financials reports. The terminal value of the company was calculated and brought back to the present value. The yearly estimated cashflow were also brought back to present value. The company's share count grows by around 7% yearly. 101M shares was used to calculate the final expected share price of $0.43.

 

https://preview.redd.it/mq16uzbde8k51.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfad66d286451927594f3418059e9b3ded82d955

&#x200B;

|Name|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Expected CF per Share|0.3210|
|Current Cash per Share|0.1085|
|Expected Share Price|0.4295|
|Current Share Price|0.14|

 

Sitting with a big pile of cash I was curious to see how it reflected per share. It comes out near $0.11/share which is pretty high considering the fact that the company trades at $0.14. The market is basically valuing this company at $0.03/share translating to not even $3M. A company value is reflected the future cashflow and outcome of the company, and I find it interesting that the company is valued at $3M while they will generate at least $3M this year with their investments.

Adding the present value per share of the cashflow and the current cash per share the final estimated share prices comes at around $0.43 which I believe is a much fairer estimated value.

t3_il616f,Dollar Hedging,"USD has declined almost 10% compared to rest of the world. What is the best way to hedge this risk?

I am very new to this, so this post is more asking for a discussion than me providing an answer.

I found this article in Fidelity interesting: [https://www.fidelity.com/insights/markets-economy/prepare-weaker-dollar?ah=1](https://www.fidelity.com/insights/markets-economy/prepare-weaker-dollar?ah=1)

Text:

>U.S. investors are used to a strong dollar, and most don’t pay attention to its fluctuations. But the greenback’s value, relative to other major currencies, has fallen 10% over the past five months—and many expect the slide to continue. Investors have three options—stick to the original portfolio and simply ride out the currency fluctuations; shift into asset classes that tend to do better under a weakening dollar; and/or seek out investments designed to take advantage of a falling dollar.  
>  
>After the greenback suffered its worst month in a decade, investors are wondering why the drop. Here’s a close look at the forces behind it.© Financial Times 2020. These presentations are provided for informational purposes only.  
>  
>The dollar’s recent fall is primarily a result of the U.S. government’s monetary easing policies in response to the pandemic-triggered economic disruptions. Lower interest rates have made the currency less attractive to hold. In addition, the dollar supply surged as the Federal Reserve opened swap lines with other central banks. And the huge fiscal stimulus and mounting national debt have boosted demand for foreign capital.  
>  
>What’s more, as life in many parts of the world has begun to get back on track, the U.S. still doesn’t have Covid-19 under control. “The second-quarter GDP is the weakest we’ve seen on record,” says Schroders investment strategist Whitney Sweeney. “That—along with the increasing coronavirus infections—is really adding to concerns about weaker economic growth in the U.S. Simply being the haven is not going to be enough to bolster the dollar going forward.”  
>  
>Indeed, this might be the beginning of an extended dollar decline, says Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. She expects the currency to drop another 5% to 10% in the next year or two. “The Fed’s forward guidance says they’ll keep the rates low and liquidity ample for a couple of years. That’s a signal to the market that they don’t have a lot to fear in other currencies,” she says. “Investors have been heavily weighted in dollar assets, and now might be the time to diversify a little more broadly.”  
>  
>Investors could dial up their allocation to international assets, which typically benefit from a weakening dollar. Since foreign-based companies report their earnings in the local currency, U.S. investors will enjoy a larger gain when translating those numbers into dollars. For a well-diversified exposure, the $24 billion Vanguard Total International Stock ETF ( [VXUS](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=VXUS) ), which owns some 7,000 stocks from more than 45 countries, returned 18% over the past three months, beating the SPDR S&P 500 ( [SPY](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=SPY)) by more than two percentage points.  
>  
>Investors should check whether an international fund is hedged against currency fluctuations or not. The hedged funds can protect returns when the dollar strengthens but will underperform when a cheaper dollar gives international assets an extra lift. While hedged and unhedged funds generate similar returns over the long run, in the short term, there can be big differences. Over the past three months, for example, the $49 billion iShares MSCI EAFE exchange-traded fund ( [EFA](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=EFA) ) gained 16.2%, while the $2.3 billion iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF ( [HEFA](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=HEFA) ) returned just 9.9%. “If the dollar continues to weaken, the unhedged funds should do better than the hedged funds,” says Morningstar ETF specialist Alex Bryan.  
>  
>A falling dollar can lead to inflation—higher prices for everything from apparel to airline fares. The core consumer price index, while still running lower than a year ago, jumped 0.6% from June to July, marking the fastest monthly rise since 1991. Yet, many economists say it’s too soon to worry. “We doubt that the rise in CPI in July is the start of a trend to higher inflation,” says Jones. “With the unemployment rate over 10% and excess capacity in so many industries, it’s unlikely that inflation can move up in a meaningful way this year.”  
>  
>Investors who want to be extra-cautious can shift some of their Treasuries into Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, whose face value rises with the consumer price index. Due to the Treasuries’ very low yields, however, Jones says that investors should “purely look at it as a hedge, rather than something that can produce income.”  
>  
>Hard assets like commodities are another hedge against inflation. Precious metals, in particular, have soared lately. ETFs such as the $33 billion iShares Gold Trust ( [IAU](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=IAU) ) and $14 billion iShares Silver Trust ( [SLV](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=SLV) ) are backed by physical commodities and closely track their prices. The $967 million Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking ETF ( [DBC](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=DBC) ) offers a broader exposure, with futures contracts on 14 heavily traded commodities. Stock in companies that mine and trade commodities are another option, though usually more volatile.  
>  
>Finally, to specifically profit from a falling dollar, investors can directly bet on foreign currencies through the $76 million Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bearish ETF ( [UDN](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=UDN) ), which shorts the U.S. Dollar Index futures contracts and makes money if the dollar drops against six other major currencies. Be aware of the concentration risk; the euro alone accounts for half of the move.  
>  
>Morningstar’s Bryan recommends the iShares International Treasury Bond ETF ( [IGOV](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=IGOV) ) as a more diversified alternative; it owns a broad basket of government bonds from non-U.S. developed markets. Since interest rates in these countries are close to zero, the fund largely moves against the dollar’s value. But that also means no additional gains besides the currency movement. Bryan warns: “You are not really getting paid for holding the Treasuries, but it’s a safe place to park the money while you are riding out the movements of the dollar.”",48,0.88,1599050421.0
t3_ily5ae,DCF of Canadian Solar ($CSIQ) using unlevered free cash flow -- a potential 53% profit?,"Edit: some recalculation for the fair value made my upside slightly incorrect. It should be ~46% upside.

**Background**

Canadian Solar (CSIQ) is a manufacturer of solar photovoltaic modules and provides solar energy solutions. It operates through the Module and System Solutions (MSS) and Energy segments. The MSS segment involves in the design, development, manufacture, and sales of solar power products and solar system kits, and operation and maintenance services. The Energy segment comprises primarily of the development and sale of solar projects, operating solar power projects and the sale of electricity. The company is headquartered in Guelph, Canada.

**Why the Interest?**

This company hit my radar as I was playing around with a stock screener (around 2 months ago). For what is arguably a semiconductor and energy company, it was ridiculously cheap. Here are the current ratios:

- P/E: 8.65

- Forward P/E: 7.88

- EV/S: 0.87

- EV/EBITDA: 6.54

- EV/EBIT: 7.50

- PEG: 0.35

- P/S: 0.53

- P/B: 1.21

Without even necessarily reseaching, it is obvious that this is much cheaper than its sector, and even industry. What's the catch though?

**Debt and Profits**

This company has a lot of debt relative to its equity. Some ratios:

- Debt/Equity: 2.90

- Net debt/EBITDA: 2.43

- Current ratio: 1.15

- Quick ratio: 0.95

With a market cap of $1.69B, it holds a total of $3.061B in debt. It's margins aren't the healthiest when compared to its competitors too:

- Profit margin: 5.36%

- Oper. margin: 11.62%

- Gross margin: 22.45%

- EBIT margin: 11.62%

- EBITDA margin: 13.34%

However, it does have nice prospects of growing as seen by its growing revenue, and recently beating expectations in earnings and revenue. Some more ratios:

- Ret. on assets: 4.82%

- Ret. on equity: 18.12%

- ROIC: 4.35%

- ROCE: 15.07%

**DCF Valuation**

My 5 year projection DCF valuation is available to view and download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJOL19mwh9XZqX2aS6dP9TccGZV04Pbc/view?usp=sharing).

Highlights:

- Average revenue growth of 17.5% for the next 5 years (many projects in the pipeline, high at first, lower later)

- 20% future tax rate (low because of future tax policy favouring green energy)

- CapEx starting high at 15% for the first two years and then 10% for the next 3

- Cost of Debt (after taxes) is 2.7%, Cost of Equity 15.2%, WACC 8.1%

- Perpetual Growth Rate of 2.5% (average for most fimrs)

- Final EV: $5 234.1MM

- Fair Value Equity: $2 662.4MM

- **Fair Value Equity/Share: $44.84**

**Current upside (with share value @ 30.75) of 46%**

Any criticism and ideas are very much appreciated. This is my first **real** DCF, and I hope I got things correct.

One thing I wanted to do was a 5 factor model for the Cost of Equity, but I had a hard time finding the specific risk betas for the company. Anyway, I hope 15% is enough of the cost of equity anyway.

What are your thoughts on CSIQ, and solar in general?",76,0.92,1599154635.0
t3_ilwiz9,Declining period lengths,"In the dot-com bubble, the Nasdaq peaked on March 10th at 5,048 and fell to 1,114 in October 2002. The largest one-day decline was around -9.5% in April 2000. 

The drop in April was sharp, but it didn't mean the issues were over, because the markets still had about 2 years to finish their movement lower. 

The drop in the 2008/2009 timeline was different. The S&P500 peaked in October 2007 and reached a trough in March 2009. The peak to trough was about 1.5 years, less than the dot-com bubble at 2.5 years. The other difference is that the time from the largest daily drop to the trough was less from October 2008 to March 2009.

I have three items for the group's views:

1. Why do the markets take so long to finish their ""correction?"" (Excuse me if my terminology is not correct) The decline in the dot-com era was very slow taking over 2 years to reach a bottom. Is this just momentum at play, where investor selling invites more selling as prices drop?

2. The issues in 08/09 were different with sharper changes and a shorter time peak/trough and the time between the market's largest decline and trough. Was this possibly due to reduced liquidity, and the perceived (even reality) impacts of a shaky financial sector that underpins the economy?

3. Finally... the markets have been strange for a while, growing in the face of the corona virus, rise of apps like Robin Hood, and generally just lofty valuations for some tech names. The Nasdaq is down a bit today, 4%, and I hate to focus on any day's events. I believe the take away from questions #1 and #2 is that if this, or another day, turns out to be a change in the tide, it could take a while to ""finish."" Would anyone else have views on this?",5,0.7,1599149754.0
t3_iljdi2,FB Long Thesis - $350 price target,"Update: Thanks for all the feedback folks! I wrote this up pretty quickly, and in hindsight I would have spent more time on the upside and downside catalysts ('bull case' and 'bear case'?). I would have also ran a 10-year forecast, used a lower RFR and a lower terminal value commencing at end of 10-year forecast. 

Hi folks, been invested in FB for a bit over a year and entered into first position at \~$160. With 30% YTD increase in share price and recent run-up of tech I thought I would write a quick long thesis on why I am still invested.

Please let me know in the comments what you think and any suggestions you have. Do you agree / disagree and why?

**Disclaimer**: This is not investment advice and I am not a licensed investment professional. this post is purely for for discussion purposes. Invest at your own risk.

**Summary**:

* **Current Price**: $302 per share
* **Target Price**: $350 per share
* **Implied upside**: 16%

**Commercial**

* Monthly active users (""MAU"") grew 8% y/y to 2.5 billion in 2019. Growth in the US, Canada and Europe was flat y/y with primary growth from Asia-Pacific and Rest of World
* Average revenue per user (""ARPU"") grew 17% y/y to $29.25 in 2019. On a constant market-by-market basis, ARPU grew 24% in the United States & Canada, 20% in Europe, 18% in Asia‑Pacific, and 16% in Rest of World.
* FB continues to innovate product offering and has recently launched *Reels* and *Instagram Shop* which should continue to monetize platform and grow ARPU
* Consumers are increasingly purchasing online, accelerated by adoption due to COVID-19. Older and wealthier demographic, which has been the slowest adopt online shopping have been introduced to online economy out of necessity.

**Risks**

* US anti-trust legislation, consumer privacy and content moderation hang over stock and could increase run-rate cost structure
* Though not yet played out, consumer spending decrease could cause online advertising spend to decrease, causing short-term volatility to earnings
* New platforms such as TikTok could take away market share from younger demographic and eat into long-term growth in MAU and ARPU

**Forecast Assumptions**

* **Sales**: Growth of 18% in 2020, decreasing steadily to 12% in 2024 in line with historical trend, and ARPU and MAU growth. Consumer sentiment continues for remainder of year and holiday spending season.
* **Cost structure**: 45% sustainable EBITDA margin and 22% capex load, which includes investments to content moderation, internal product development, and server expansion to support growth in content and video.
* **Tax** increasing to 28% to account for proposal from democrats to add conservatism

**Capital Structure**

* 91% equity financed; 9% debt
* Cash reserves fully cover debt, resulting in net cash balance of  $47B

**Cost of Capital:** 7.75% based on:

* ERP of 5.5%
* 5-year monthly Beta of 1.2 x
* Cost of debt of 1.8%
* Risk free rate of 1.7% (Higher than conventional RFR. used this as a 'plug' to increase discount rate to account for historically low interest rates and uncertainty of anti-trust legislation)
* Terminal Growth Rate of 6% (slightly higher than I would typically use, but felt appropriate given current growth rate trends, population growth and industry)

**Comps Analysis & Football**

* Very few comps to work with here given nature of industry. Focus of quality over quantify in comps.
* FB offers exceedingly good value in terms of both growth and valuation in comparison to peers, trading at roughly the same TEV/EBITDA to Alphabet but growing at twice the pace.

**Conclusion**

* Based on intrinsic value calculation and comparative company analysis, $350 price target appears appropriate
* The stock offers good value in comparison to the remaining tech sector and a good trade off of growth and value",112,0.9,1599093790.0

And then I play around a 25-year dcf based on the CAGR above in the second post.

I believe ""following"" Unity might pay dividend:

1. Engine has very long runway which is subscription-based;
2. There's uncertainty around the robustness of advertising revenue & other Operate Solutions (if any) which is rev-share / usage based;
3. Current rich SaaS valuation might spoil over to non-subscription based business (Operate Solutions) at IPO which is a source of de-rating in addition to multiple contraction;
4. Relatively high advertising revenue contribution and uncertainty of its robustness (growth) might create of volatility in overall growth;
5. \#3 & #4 might be source of drawdown of the stock sometime in the future which might create very attractive long term opportunity if it's not acquired by strategic buyers or financial investors.

t3_in9hxy,"My pitch on $VLRS, best value investment I’ve ever found, once in a cycle opportunity - coming from a former airlines analyst at a top 5 hedge fund","Thesis: VLRS is an underfollowed and catalyst-rich potential 10-bagger IF you can swallow the fact that its a levered Mexican airline. A best-in-class operator pre-crisis, VLRS is an immediate and long-term COVID beneficiary that has already doubled market share and almost recovered 2019 traffic levels as primary competitors collapse, creating a sustainable dominant position.

Description: VLRS is an ultra-low-cost Mexican airline serving domestic (~70%) and international, mostly US transborder destinations (~30%) with a focus VFR (visiting family and relatives) traffic (45%) and price sensitive leisure travelers (30%). Volaris is a best-in-class ULCC, the largest airline in Mexico and the largest ULCC in Latin America, with the 2nd lowest unit costs in the world. 

Valuation: Our 2026 price target is MXN204/sh (USD$95/ADR), roughly 10x upside - based on a typical high-quality ULCC forward P/E multiple of 14x on FY27 EPS of MXN14. From 2019 through 2027 we expect an ASM CAGR of 10.6%, RASM CAGR of 1% (reflecting depressed pre-COVID environment and ancillary execution), CASM @ -1.5% (reflecting fleet transition and pre-COVID fuel prices). 

Market Dislocation: 
1.) Hairy, foreign listed small-cap airline and trades only 3m USD / day - high discoverability
2.) Poor sell-side coverage - despite significant interim newsflow, including the almost-complete recovery of volumes to pre-COVID levels, US sell-side coverage has not updated models since July. For example, current consensus capacity for 3Q reflects roughly 4,122k ASMs vs. 4,800 based on actuals through Aug and mgmts stated planes for Sep
3.) Sellside and buyside always fails to model the impact of upgauging and fuel efficiency during significant fleet transitions - many sellside models either don't model the fleet or actually apply the wrong number of seats entirely, underestimating growth implied and incremental costs associated
4.) Market anchors to minimum contractual fleet without consideration of significant ability to extend leases or pull forward deliveries if the recovery remains strong, especially if additional capital is raised 
5.) IFRS 15 and 16 changes make spot check comparisons messy and the capital structure look worse than reality
6.) Persistent overcapacity in recent years is not reflective of earnings power in a more consolidated market. In 2019, Interjet was discounting aggressively to generate cash in an effort to maintain solvency which depressed fares below rational levels


Key Investment Factors:

1.) Accelerating secular growth of Mexican aviation demand – From 2007 to 2018 air trips per capita in Mexico has grown from 0.25 to 0.36 compared to 0.72 for Chile and 0.45 for Brazil. Since VLRS’s founding in 2006, the domestic market has grown at a CAGR of 7.6%, international market at 4.9% (US transborder >20%) and total Mexican market 6.2%. Mexico’s demographics are supportive, with a young population and an emerging middle class expected to comprise 50% of the population by 2032

2.) Bus switching presents a long runway for sustained growth – Mexico’s inter-city bus market is 70x the size of the air market (>3bn bus pax vs. 54m air pax in 2019). 41% of VLRS’s routes pre-COVID had only bus competition and VLRS sees buses as the primarily competitor and source of growth. Amazingly, VLRS flights are actually cheaper in many cases than the competing bus trips and VLRS runs ticket giveaways at bus stations to convert first time flyers. First time flyers comprised 6% of 2019 passengers and 82% of passengers surveyed would not travel by bus again. COVID has pulled forward bus switching given the difference in trip duration. 

3.) Market share gains from 30%+ reduction of domestic capacity and collapse of primary competitors – 
a. VLRS has captured ~50% of the growth in the domestic market since its founding and has grown from a 4% in 2006 share to 31.1% in 2019. In July, VLRS held 45% share of the domestic market which is sustainable and could grow further. 
b. Aeromexico’s domestic market share has shrunk from 40% in 2011 to 24% in 2019 as the legacy carrier has basically ceded the domestic market to ULCCs and runs it primarily to feed international travel. Aeromexico is currently in chapter 11 and is expected to reduce its fleet by at least 30%. 
c. Interjet (19.7% 2019 domestic share) is the 3rd largest ULCC, but is the most important competitor to VLRS since they share Toluca as their main hubs and since Interjet has been aggressively discounting since 2018 in order to manage solvency issues. 60 of Interjet’s 66 planes have been repossessed leaving them with a ragtag fleet of six barely operable Russian Sukhoi Superjets. 
d. Viva Aerobus is another ULCC with 20.2% of the market in 2019, through Viva tends to stay in its lane geographically and focus in different airports than Volaris. Viva will definitely be looking to take their slice of Interjet’s and Aeromexico’s forfeited routes and slots, though its unlikely they’d be overaggressive with VLRS in an environment of massive undersupply

4.) Expanding and sustainable cost advantage embedded in underappreciated fleet transition – VLRS has the second lowest unit cost in the world and has a RASM lower than Aeromexico’s CASM. Airbus NEO (new engine option) are roughly 10% cheaper on a unit cost basis, driven by fuel efficiency (-14% to -16% fuel burn per seat) and increased gauge (operating leverage on per-departure and per aircraft costs like pilot wages, landing fees, etc.). NEO aircraft currently make up 30% of seats in the fleet and the latest fleetplan has that growing to ~60% by 2023 (and >90% by 2026 depending on lease extensions and deferrals), Overall this translates to a ~1% embedded annual reduction in CASM through 2026 assuming no other other cost improvements off of 2019. Said differently, we expect VLRS’s average seats per aircraft to grow from 185 today to 198 by 2026.

5.) Upside from price and/or fleet flexibility – VLRS has pushed out 24 neo deliveries from 2020-2022 to 2027-2028 in order to save USD$200m of predelivery payments – if demand recovers more quickly VRLS could reaccelerate those orders and grow the fleet 20%+ in the next three years. VLRS has historically also extended leases beyond the contractual redelivery date, though the published fleet plan only reflects contractual deliveries and redeliveries. VLRS remains nimble and able to accelerate growth and take share if demand is strong or to recover pricing and build cash

6.) Ancillary revenue upside – since 2011 non-ticket revenue per passenger has grown at a ~19% CAGR, and remains below comparable global ULCC peers in absolute value and % of revenue. We’d expect this to grow per management’s comments and historical execution, as well as supportive baggage attach rate data through July

7.) Additional growth opportunities from newly-freed slots in previously capacity-constrained Mexico City and expansion into Central America – Historically capacity constrained Mexico City airport has use-it-or-lose-it rules and given the fleet outlook, the incumbents (Aeromexico and Interjet) look as if they will finally lose it, opening the door for VLRS to land-grab valuable slots. VLRS is in the early stages of ramping up subsidiaries in Costa Rica and El Salvador, both of which are high-priced markets with limited ULCCs penetration and significant growth opportunities (watch out CPA)

Risks/Mitigants:
1.) Travel recovery - globally, passenger travel has been slow to recover, with some suggesting a structurally lower level of travel as the ""new normal"". VLRS carries primarily VFR and leisure traffic which is more resilient and quicker to recover than corporate travel, but of course the future is unknown and a second shutdown could increase the risk of a dilutive issuance.

2.) Liquidity - while VLRS is net-positive cash ex-leases and has executed a substantial and impressive liquidity preservation plan (see 2Q20 call and latest investor pres), a second shutdown VLRS would potentially require a further deferral of deliveries, limiting VLRS’s ability to fully capitalize on the opportunity market share opportunity. The company said on the 2Q20 call they expect 40-45m USD of monthly cash burn in 3Q20 and that all incremental capacity decisions would be made on the basis of incremental cash contributions - given the capacity recovery since the call we expect the 3Q20 exit rate to be much lower. VLRS is a critical customer to airbus, airports and other suppliers and we would expect further deferrals or negotiations to be successful if travel deteriorates from here

3.) Potential equity or convert issuance - The board has convened an Extraordinary Assembly for 9/18/20 at which they're expected to propose an issuance of debt, converts or shares. The uncertainty creates an overhang, but we believe it is more likely driven by a desire to re-establish a more aggressive fleet plan that was tempered in the depth of the crisis. We would expect that senior debt markets remain open to VLRS.

4.) Uncertain overhang from extended booking period - VLRS extended their booking period out to Oct 2021 and offered 125% flight credits for customers willing to re-book which could be an overhang on unit revenue through 2021, though the does maximize volumes on which to earn ancillary revenue and maximized aircraft utilization. This was a wise move by mgmt to minimize cash outflows from refunds, but with air traffic liability greater than 1/2 of available cash, a second shutdown could reintroduce liquidity risk or extend fare weakness a few quarters into the recover (though we’d expect this to be made up with close in pricing if travel surprises to the upside)

5.) General FX and macro related to Mexico

Catalysts: 
1.) Consistently improving monthly traffic reports and 3Q earnings to drive positive earnings revisions even if general air traffic recovery is weak
2.) Earnings power in the post-COVID competitive environment to become clear
3.) Removal of overhang form potential capital raise following 9/18 board meeting
4.) Further clarification of Viva and Aeromexico's post-COVID fleet outlooks
5.) Re-launch of Central American expansion and reintroduction of use-it-or-lose provisions in Mexico City, forcing the expected official forfeit by peers of slots temporarily granted to VLRS

Management/Holders highlights: 
1.) Indigo Partners/Bill Franke: Volaris is backed (15% current stake) by budget-airline guru Bill Franke's firm Indigo Partners, which also has stakes in Eastern-European carrier Wizz (another write-up to follow), Chile's Jetsmart and Frontier (with which Volaris has recently introduced a codeshare agreement with). Collectively, Indigo has an orderbook of 636 Airbus A320-family neo and XLR aircraft. Bill Franke is the former CEO of America West, Chairman of Wizz and Frontier. Indigo also launched and has since exited Spirit Airlines and Singapore's Tiger Air. Doug Parker (AAL CEO) and Scott Kirby (UAL CEO) are among the airline industry leaders originally hired by Bill Franke to America West. Other notable founding Volaris investors include Harry Krensky’s Discovery Americas (current stake 2.41%), as well as Latin American business giants Carlos Slim, Emilio Azcárraga (Televisa) and Roberto Kriete (TACA) (current stake 7.6%).

2.) CEO Enrique Beltranena (0.9% holder) has been an aviation fanatic since 8 years old and joined the industry with his home country of Guatemala’s Aviateca during privatization in 1988. He became general manager of the Aviateca and was responsible for its merger with, Sahsa, Nica, Lacsa and TACA Peru, forming a Grupo TACA and later serving as COO for the group. In 2003 the TACA boarded asked Beltrarena to develop plans for interconnecting airlines in Latin America – one of the six resulting plans was Volaris. In 2005, Beltranena left the 6,800-employee Grupo TACA founded with Volaris

3.) Enrique is supported by EVP Holger Blankenstein since VLRS’s founding, former Bain consultant who heads VLRS’s data-intensive approach to everything from network, fares, marketing and labor

t3_ix1g0c,AMC Networks ($AMCX) -- A Deep Value Play with a Near-Term Catalyst,"I'm still pretty new at this, so constructive feedback much appreciated!

AMC Networks ($AMCX) is a media company that owns cable channels, including AMC and BBC America. It’s also the channel responsible for some of the most iconic television shows of the past two decades, including *Mad Men* and *Breaking Bad*. 

**Thesis:**

AMC is a deep value play currently trading at an 5-6x EV/EBIT and 50% FCF yield that offers a near-term catalyst in the form of a 20% buy-back program over the next month. Combined with the fact that \~20% of the float is currently short, there is the potential for a rapid rise in price.

**Decline of Linear TV**

The major concern of cable companies is the trend of cord cutting and the rise of streaming services. I am not here to argue against this trend — I think it is one that will continue to prove itself true in the coming years. AMC, however, is doing a reasonable job of adjusting to this new medium, and it is still in fairly good financial health. Let’s unpack both of these points further:

1.  The transition into streaming

* AMC currently has niche programming that is available via streaming video on demand (SVOD). AMC currently projects its five SVOD programs will have between 3.5-4million subscribers at $5/month. Assuming it hits the lower end of that estimate brings AMC an addition $210 million of revenue, good for over 16% of its current market cap. By comparison, Disney+ has over 60 million subscribers. While AMC’s SVOD caters only to niche audiences, that may be enough. SVOD is not meant to compete against Netflix or Disney+; it’s meant to complement these other streaming services. During the Q2 call, AMC noted that 80% of its SVOD subscribers also subscribe to a mainstream streaming service

2.  Financial Viability

* Revenue has continued to grow in the sub-5% clip, YoY pre-Covid. Revenue is down this year due to decrease in ad spending, though it is reasonable to expect an uptick due to Election season. The company has also earned in the neighborhood $6-7 per share in the past three years, though numbers are again down Q1 and Q2 2020 ($1.47 and $0.28, respectively). The company has \~$800 million in cash, but it also has $2 billion in net debt. However, the company has consistently earned their market cap in free cash flow for the past few years, and I don’t view this debt as a major risk.

**Catalyst**

The company announced a $250 million share buyback (all in cash) this past week that will be completed in the coming month, which represents about 20% of all shares outstanding. Combine this with the fact that \~20% of the current float is short, and you have the potential for a major short squeeze.",25,0.89,1600698424.0
t3_j2oh4x,Guideline for investing in merger arbitrage,"Merger arbitrage has become a popular investment strategy used both by professional capital allocators and retail investors alike.  It constantly provides numerous attractive situations, but in order to find them, you need to know what to look for and how to spot the red flags as well. 

In essence, and this is crucial, opportunities to profit from merger arbitrage arise from investor's assessment that the market is overestimating/incorrectly pricing the risks of potential failure, and then betting on the successful closure of the merger (or from pure luck - by guessing correctly which mergers will close successfully).

Therefore, the first question to be asked upon stumbling across a seemingly attractive merger arbitrage case is - why does this spread exist? There are numerous points one has to check before answering this question.

Short summary checklist to use in the research process: 

* Why does the spread exist? What are the main risks and conditions (shareholder approval, regulatory consent, etc.)?
* Is the spread appropriate given the risks or this the market mispricing this opportunity?
* What is the downside if the transaction fails? How does the risk/reward look like? Collecting pennies in front of a steamroller might not be the best strategy for generating investment returns.
* What kind of offer is this? Non-binding and hostile offers are more uncertain, but in certain cases might offer a larger upside.
* What is the type of consideration offered? If this is an all-stock merger - are there enough shortable shares available for hedging? The payment of CVRs usually takes much longer than the closing of the merger itself.
* What is the strategic rationale behind the offer for both parties?
* Is the buyer credible? Will it be able to finance the transaction?
* What is the estimated timeline? What are the chances of it being delayed? International mergers are prone to delays. Large-cap mergers have a higher risk of this as well.
* Where there any other bidders? Is there a possibility of a bidding war? In case the current deal fails, how likely is it for another bidder to appear? Is there a go-shop period?
* Are there any activist shareholders involved? What are their intentions/agenda?
* How likely is the approval from shareholders? Does the offered price seem ""fair"" for both sides? What other aspects are present that could impact the decision of shareholders? Who are the major shareholders and how are they likely to vote?
* Are there any objecting shareholders?
* What regulatory approvals are required? What issues could regulators potentially find with the merger (competition, national security)? Regulatory risk is hard to handicap, however, small/micro-cap transactions usually get approvals easier.
* What is the termination fee? And does it offer any downside protection?
* Position sizing - can one stomach the downside the transaction fails, or add to the position if the spread increases?
* In what industry the merger takes place? It might be good to avoid overhyped industries.
* What are the chances one still missing something? For larger size transaction spreads almost always exist for a reason.

\- Margin of Safety (MOS) was set at 20%

\- 5YR GR was average EPS growth rate over the past 5 years

The fundamentals of AIA supported the books principles in that it has a good BV and Profit growth over time, as well has reduced its D/E to below 50%.

However, it lacks strength in ROE (advised was 10-15% avg.) and FCF (advised was positive FCF over 10yr).

t3_j494kf,Interesting Question from Client,"Pension client asked me to determine the amount interest rates would have to increase for the plan to be fully funded. Computing the MV change in the bond portfolio is easy. 

Then it had me wondering.... on the equity side of the equation what would prompt the fed to raise rates? And what would the outcome be for equity markets? The only rational thing that makes sense is an inflation print way above 2% where the fed gets worried about it running away from them. FOMC has already said they need to see sustained prints above 2% to even consider raising rates. Given the fragile state of the current economy now and for the immediate future, increasing rates would almost certainly constrain consumption with the cost of money increasing.

What is the most appropriate way to estimate the impact to equity markets? What do you think is a conservative estimate for downward % shock to equities? Looks like based on LDI portfolio I’d estimate a shock of rates somewhere between +400 to +500 is where they would need to land to get to fully funded. Clearly impact to equity markets has less of an impact than the movements in rates impact to the PBO and bond sleeve. Appreciate anyone’s insight on estimate equity selloff for the purposes of this silly question.",50,0.89,1601697313.0
t3_j59ihi,Huntington Ingalls Industries: A discounted defense stock in uncertain times,"**Overview**

* HII is a mid-cap defense contractor that builds destroyers, aircraft carriers, and nuclear submarines for the U.S Navy, U.S Coast Guard, and allies.
* Over the last few months, the stock has taken a huge hit (-28.22% YTD) due to COVID and a worse than expected earnings miss (-68%) in the most recent quarter. 
* Valuation, healthy fundamentals, and competitive moat suggest **\~27% upside** to current price.

Currently America’s biggest military shipbuilder, Huntington was spun off Northrop Grumman’s shipbuilding segment in 2011 and has steadily grown ever since then. The business comprises of three segments: Ingalls, which produces assault ships, surface combatants, and cutters; Newport, which produces nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers; and Technical Solutions, which is their newest segment, offers consulting services to the DoD and private sector companies. 

**Fundamentals**

* Median revenue growth is 5.3%, which is expected considering that 87% of their revenues come from the DoD.
* Consistent ROIC growth from 11% to 19% over 10 years, compared to industry average of 5.9%.
* As a mature company, HII has focused on delivering better bottom line growth, with an operating income CAGR of 13.6%.
* Healthy backlog of $46.5 billion, cash flows should be safe over the next few years.

**Valuation**

* Discount rate: 4.62% given exposure to mostly U.S based customers, low cost of debt.
* Revenues: Negative growth next year due to the pandemic, adjusted to 3% as defense spending increases. Management has been focusing on expanding the Technical Solutions segment which should increase growth over the long term.
* Operating margins: Even though product demand was relatively unaffected, Huntington was heavily impacted by the pandemic due to the shipyards only being allowed to operate at 65% capacity, which lowered margins. As they implement safety protocols, operation capacity should be expected to revert to normal levels in a few years.
* ROIC and reinvestment are maintained at current levels.
* Value of equity per share is $**197.20**, while the stock was trading at $144.13.

[HII Valuation](https://preview.redd.it/jtne28su36r51.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=35ab805a30f2f070314407b50c1ae96bf9262c2c)

**Risks**

* Election: Defense stocks are almost always volatile during election years, although neither Pres. Trump nor Biden are planning any defense spending cuts, volatility should be expected in the near term.
* COVID-19: Future lockdowns and outbreaks could affect production and impact margins.

t3_j9akfz,Is ROIC an adequate measure of return for REITs?,"Hi Everyone,

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to post this here or in the CFA thread, but I guess I could receive some sound advice.

Basically below is a photo from the L1 Equity section in the CFA material, and it shows that Real estate companies are actually destroying value.

https://preview.redd.it/iiycexw9cis51.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ea707e459a2ddd21d39da85270ef862a826b69a

Do you think that's true in practice, or is it just a cause of the reporting standards?

I also try to use the valuation model template from Ashwath Damodaran, and his reinvestment assumptions are also based on ROIC. My problem is that I'm hitting a wall when trying to value REIT companies, as I don't think that those are some good measures, since they are all based on net income instead of FFO.

If someone here is working in the real estate industry, could you help me understand what measures of return do you use for valuation? And also how do you project for reinvestments?",36,0.91,1602440764.0

t3_jb9et4,Failure to Impact - Are ESG Funds Delivering on Investor Ambitions,"Most ESG investors have high aspirations, and addressing climate change is chief among them. There’s only one problem: Passive ESG funds don’t allocate to the companies that will have any real influence. ESG strategies typically avoid stocks of companies with a heavier carbon footprint, but those are the very businesses that will supply the raw materials for renewable technologies to enable a carbon neutral transition.

In our latest research brief, we provide a new investment solution to investors wanting to affect positive environmental change. Our paper proposes allocating to the real asset industries on which a carbon neutral transition depends, but allocating in a way that rewards those companies who will be a fundamental part of that transition, and/or who are evolving to dramatically reduce their emissions.

Within the brief we explore:

* The typical makeup of a passive ESG vehicle, and why its structure misses the mark when it comes to affecting environmental change.
* The problems associated with relying on backward-looking ESG scores to allocate capital.
* A data-driven look at the amount of raw materials carbon intensive industries will have to produce to enable renewable technologies to proliferate.
* Why allocating capital to carbon intensive businesses – but allocating selectively – may serve as a better construct for rebuilding the world in a carbon-lite manner.

t3_jclsq6,Analysis of Unity Software ($U),"Hi All,

This is my first time posting on this sub. 

I did a deep-dive on Unity Software ($U) recently, which I believe is an interesting opportunity.  Would love to know what you all think.

I have posted a summary version here. If you are interested in a more detailed version, you can find it here: [https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/unity-u-creating-the-future](https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/unity-u-creating-the-future)

**Unity Software ($U)**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What does it do?**

Unity is a very cool company and an impressive business. It makes two types of products:

**Create Solutions: 30% of revenue**

Software which allows creators (artists, developers etc.) to develop many different types of content across platforms (Mobile, PC, incl. Virtual Reality). The company charges a monthly subscription fee for this solution, across various tiers. Smash hit *Pokemon Go* was built on Unity.

**Operate Solutions: 61% of revenue**

A wide variety of software and solutions that allow content / game creators to operate and monetize their games (e.g. analytics to optimize engagement, In-App Purchases). Unity charges a share of the revenue that content /game creators make or sometimes usage based fee. This is a healthy business model as it grows with the usage of any game / content using Unity operate solutions.

Key to note here is that customers can use Operate solutions even on content that was not created on Unity.

**I like:**

* High gross margins (80%)
* Large Gaming TAM ($12B, growing at 6%) and Non Gaming TAM ($17B)
* Lot of room to grow in Non Gaming category
* Accelerating revenue growth, but cost efficient
* Asymmetric opportunity to benefit if VR becomes a dominant technology in future

**I don’t like:**

* Platform risk (dependency on Apple / Google)
* Dynamic competition leading to pressure on free cash flows

One thing I really liked about Unity was their focus to grow their large customers (>$100k TTM revenue) from 389 to 716 in last 10 quarters. This results in a lot of sales efficiency.

Additionally, their dollar net expansion rate is 122-142% in the last 10 quarters (this means a customer who spent $100 last quarter, spend $122-$142 this quarter - a very positive sign). Unity’s net expansion rates are in the upper quartile of all high growth SaaS companies.

One of the key risks I see with Unity is platform risk. As we saw with Epic games recently, Google and Apple control Unity’s access to its customers and this poses platform risk for Unity. This is a serious issue and not unique to them, but they have to find a way around this. Their foray outside gaming should help to some extent.

Another key point is that they are in an industry where they have to constantly innovate and have dynamic competition. Their R&D cost grew by 40% YoY to $167M in H1, 2020 and now represent 47% of its revenue. This is quite high and a drain on cash flows. Unity has to continue to perform well on revenue growth, else cash flows can suffer a lot in future which will become a risk on stock price.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Valuation**

Unity had a spectacular IPO (no surprises) on Sept 18, and since then has gone on to reach a market cap of $22B (\~$83.5 / share, ending Friday Oct 2, 2020), resulting in an EV / Sales (TTM) of 35.3.  This valuation puts it in the category of other high growth SaaS companies like Docusign, Cloudflare who are also growing revenue upwards of 40%. 

Overall I like Unity’s leading position, and its future growth prospects. The valuations are quite rich as is with the sector in general. I would look for any decent drop as a good opportunity for opening new positions.

t3_jfgq90,Goosehead Insurance Analysis (GHSD),"Hi all,

Long time lurker, first timer poster. A little nervous about sharing this.

Please give me feedback and let me know how I can improve my analysis.

I wrote an article on Goosehead Insurance, which I believe makes for a good investment at the moment. It went public in 2018 and has been profitable and is growing quickly. The article was written a few weeks ago and GHSD's price has risen quite a bit even since then.

My article is below. I won't post the link because I don't know if it's allowed, but the article does contain a financial model you can use to come up with your own valuation. Feel free to message me if you'd like it.

## 

## Summary

* Goosehead Insurance’s future growth rests in its customer service
* The P/E ratio is high but justifiable given past and likely future growth
* Goosehead has a strong management team focused on growth and investments in technology
* Valuation looks fair, but strong growth is still likely

Source: [Goosehead 2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1726978/000172697820000088/gshd-20191231.htm)

## Past Growth

Goosehead went public on April 27, 2018. Since then, their share price has climbed from an opening $12 to a high of $115.11. It’s settled currently at $81.64 after a retracement.

*This still represents an amazing growth rate of 580%.* 

I believe that not only is a high stock price growth rate justified, but it is likely to continue into the coming years. 

Since going public, Goosehead has had positive free cash flow and has been able to invest for sustainable growth. Major investments have been made into their team and technology for a competitive edge.

Seeing as they will be competing with major brands like Geico, Progressive, and State Farm, they will need a major edge to continue their growth.

## Customer Service

Goosehead’s pride rests in its corporate customer service team. Its business is structured so that agents (franchisees) will be able to focus on selling and selling only.

All service calls are meant to be handled by the service team in Texas and dealt with quickly. 

The corporate customer service team is meant to be highly trained and compensated fairly to retain them. 

Goosehead boasts of its prize metric, Net Promoter Score. As their 10-K states, “We have achieved best-in-class net promoter scores for client service, nearly 2.4x the 2018 P&C industry average.”

The promoter score is essentially an internal metric that Goosehead uses, however it cannot be ignored that their growth is indicative that what they are doing seems to be working.

It’s important to verify Goosehead’s claims of superior customer service, since we are relying on it to project a high growth rate.

When looking over review sites, we found Wallethub had customer service scores for Goosehead and their competitors in the P&C insurance industry.

Goosehead maintains a strong 4.1 / 5 rating with State Farm the next closest at 3.8 / 5. With how competitive the insurance industry can be, even a slight advantage such as this can have a massive impact on premiums written and premiums retained.

## Future Growth

Like many small cap stocks, Goosehead may look overvalued by certain metrics. As of September 2020, it maintains a P/E ratio of 224. This is significantly higher than many investors would hope for.

It’s important to remember, though, that as a small cap stock described as an “emerging growth company,” this valuation is heavily focused on *future growth.* 

Year over year growth from CY 2018 to CY 2019, Gooshead had a 26.32% growth rate in Contingency and Agency Fees and a 32.5% growth rate in its Franchise Revenues segment.

For the most recent earnings call (Q2 2020), the executives of Goosehead spoke of their strong growth rate from the quarter compared to the same period the prior year.

Total premiums increased by 41%, indicating growth is not only strong going into 2020, but actually accelerating. During the same period, their total revenues increased by 54% and their total franchise count increased by 49%.

Because franchising is a source of revenues for Goosehead, a massive growth rate in new franchises represents essentially a 10-year annuity from payments of the franchise fee. 

These fees mixed with strong retention of insurance premiums give Goosehead a strong ability to predict existing revenues and makes it easier for forecasting future revenues.

## Investing in Team and Technology

While Goosehead’s primary revenue sources are meant to come from premiums written by their franchises and the franchise fee itself, the company focuses a lot of energy and money in its corporate teams as well.

Goosehead maintains a corporate sales team, where they invest strongly in education and training. The corporate sales team then trains the franchisees. 

While Goosehead’s revenues had strong growth rates, so did its investments in its team and technologies. As indicated above, Goosehead had a *growth rate in its G&A expenses of about 46% from 2018 to 2019.* 

Heavy investments in these areas is normal for a growth company, however. 

Goosehead invests in technology through a proprietary platform for its agents to use. Their claims are that it utilizes data analytics. Specifically, it indicates that it uses *predictive analytics*.

Goosehead claims it can use these predictive analytics features to guess which customers are most likely to be looking for new service so agents can focus their attention on them. 

Because the technology is proprietary, it’s not easy to find much more specific information on it.

## Valuation Analysis of Goosehead (GHSD) Stock

Because Goosehead is already profitable and has positive free cash flow, it is reasonable to do a discounted cash flow analysis to determine valuation. 

We projected out Goosehead’s growth in revenues higher than previous years for the first year and then slowly declining. Also, we attempted to keep most other growth rates for other items similar to past performance and most slowly declining.

We used a 3% terminal growth rate and a 15% discount rate to account for its volatility as a small cap company.

Even with using a large discount rate of 15%, we value Goosehead slightly above its current value, but with a large growth in free cash flows. 

This leads to a solid expected growth rate of 11.44%. Again, we attempted to use conservative estimates, but more optimistic ones would give us a significantly higher IRR.

For a more detailed look at our valuation model, see the original article. From there, you can edit the assumptions with your own and verify our analyses. We encourage you to come up with your own numbers.

## Conclusion

To recap, we believe that Goosehead’s strength is primarily in its customer service and investments in its team and technologies. It has proven to have a strong business model in its first few years as a public company.

As far as trying to value Goosehead, it appears Goosehead may be close to fairly valued or slightly undervalued. 

Despite this, if past growth rates are indicative of a strong future growth, we can expect that Goosehead’s stock price will likely also see a strong surge in future years.",12,0.85,1603299352.0
t3_jgati7,Analyzing High Yield Bonds,"Hi All,

I have a question about analyzing bonds. Specifically high yield. When you go about analyzing a stock, you do a DCF and comparable analysis to come to a target price and that allows you to make a buy or sell recommendation. What is the equivalent of this on high yield bonds? I feel like the interest rate is the most important part but how do you forecast the future spread a company will face, given your outlook on the companies cash flows?

Also if you could point me to any resources or books that would be amazing. I am a CFA level III candidate, so it's not like I don't know the basics of most of the topics. It's just the actual process for high yield investing seems less tangible to me. 

Thanks in advance!",62,0.93,1603407849.0

t3_jg08f3,Sprout Social (SPT) Analysis,"Hi all,

Thanks for the discussion on my post about Goosehead (GHSD). I really enjoyed that.

I did a valuation on Sprout Social (SPT) too. Like before, I won't have the financial model in the article because I don't know if it's allowed. Please message me for the model and I will happily provide it for you to do your own valuation.

Here's my deep-dive on Sprout. Happy to discuss :)

## Investment Thesis

Sprout is a growing technology company operating in the content management industry. They have seen significant growth in revenues, with an increase of 75.43% and 30.43% in core revenues for 2018 and 2019 respectively.

We expect their revenues to grow at a slightly slower rate as the market for social media content software matures, and market entrants are able to take market share.

Sprout has been unable to maintain an effective moat, keeping it unable to reach profitability.

Thesis: Because of Sprout’s inability to differentiate itself through either product or target market, their spend on marketing and advertising will continue to outpace its revenue growth and keep it from profitability.

For these reasons, we believe Sprout is significantly overvalued.

## Company Overview

Sprout Social was [founded and had its first round of funding for $1 million in 2010](https://sproutsocial.com/about/). The product, Sprout 2.0, was launched the following year. Since then, Sprout has grown to nearly $103 million in annual sales as of 2019. 

Sprout has come about in a competitive industry and struggled to establish an effective moat. However, the brand is well known by users and potential customers. It is easily identifiable by its leaf logo.

Sprout operates as a content management system for social media sites. The site offers easy-to-use software and visually appealing dashboards and reports. Also offered is analytics for marketing campaigns on the social sites.

The software allows for content management across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google, and Youtube. It allows for post scheduling, engagement, and analytics across all platforms. 

Having a centralized location for all of these features for a marketing team allows for stronger review of the effectiveness of social media campaigns and easier collaboration for marketing teams.

Sprout offers its products on a per-user basis and opens up plenty of opportunity to upsell either additional features, or add on users. 

In addition to subscription revenue, Sprout also generates revenue from professional services fees. These are primarily implementation costs by Sprout’s technical teams.

The company has not done much in the way of finding a niche. However, it does have different offerings for small businesses and larger enterprises on its site. 

Sprout seems to want to appeal to all sizes of companies as it grows. Given the competitive industry, this may not be an effective strategy long-term.

## Industry Overview

The industry that Sprout operates in – social media content management- is relatively new on the scene. Sprout was one of the earlier contenders in the space and managed to grow to a respectable size.

Like all those in the social media space, Sprout’s dashboards are sleek and their software is easy-to-use. Because of this, it’s had high user scores and customer retention.

These are definitely points for a higher valuation for Sprout, but there is nothing that Sprout has that is unique to them in this sense. 

All the points that Sprout maintains for strong user experience, their competitors do too. It is simply expected of the companies in the industry now, not a standout feature.

Sprout has many competitors, but their most notable ones would be [Hootsuite and Hubspot](https://www.capterra.com/social-media-marketing-software/compare/121701-171840-121447/HootSuite-vs-HubSpot-Marketing-vs-Sprout-Social).

Of these, Hubspot appears to be best for smaller companies. Their starting price point is much lower than Hootsuite at $50/month compared to Hootsuite’s $190/month.

Despite this, Hootsuite claims to cater to smaller and medium-sized companies. 

Sprout targets both large and small companies, but because they have not identified a niche, they are likely to lose market share to Hootsuite in the small business market with their lower entry price point.

Also troubling for Sprout is their lack of transparency. Of the three, Sprout is the only one that does not offer a minimum price on their website.

Again, this could cause a loss in the small business market. But it would be less likely to lose market share in the more sophisticated large business market, where potential users would be more willing to ask for a consultation for pricing and customization.

## Strengths

Sprout has a strong balance sheet and cash position. This strength, however, points to a hidden weakness. The company is about ten years old, and in that time, it is still funded primarily through rounds of equity funding, not positive operating cash flow.

This means it has not reached profitability yet, and its cash burn reflects that. Despite the negative operating and investing cash flows, Sprout’s 2019 IPO funding should keep its balance sheet and cash position stable for at least a few more years, even if it cannot reach positive cash flows.

Another strength of Sprout’s is its revenue growth rate. High growth is expected for a new technology company, however. Its core revenues grew a staggering 75.43% and 30.43% for years 2018 and 2019, respectively.

## Weaknesses

For Sprout’s weaknesses, we can compare operating results to competing companies to see where they may be underperforming in the broader industry.

Sprout’s gross profit appears strong, with a gross margin hovering around 25% over years 2017-2019. It increases slightly from year to year.

Cost of revenue consists primarily of hosting costs and providing support to customers on the platform. 

While this margin would be very admirable for a company offering a tangible product, software companies are generally expected to maintain lower gross profit margins.

For comparison, Hubspot’s gross profit margin is [19.26% for 2019](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HUBS/financials/). This leads us to believe Hubspot is more efficient in offering its products and services to its customers than Sprout is.

Hubspot’s average annual growth rate in its core revenues hovers around 30-40%. Although this rate is slightly lower than Sprout posted in 2018 of 75.43%, it controls significantly more market share. 

Hubspot’s 2019 revenues were $674 million, compared to Sprout’s $103 million.

Given that Sprout is significantly smaller than Hubspot, we would expect Sprout’s revenues to be growing at a faster rate than Hubspot since there is more market share available for Sprout to take.

This leads us to believe there are inefficiencies in the marketing department for Sprout that are hampering its growth potential. It also appears there are operational inefficiencies reducing its ability to improve its profit margin.

## Opportunities

The industry is [expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1%](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/social-media-management-market-321810.html), and we forecasted Sprout’s revenues at a generous range of growth from 50% to 17% CAGR over a ten year period. 

Sprout’s primary opportunities will come from the growth in the industry around it. The other opportunity it should benefit from is its age and the benefits that it affords. This will primarily come from its contacts at larger companies.

Sprout should see sufficient cross-selling opportunities in the companies it already transacts with. And the fact that it utilizes a per-user pricing model means that as a client of theirs grows, the more users it may need to license.

Customer build-up and increased user licenses means customer retention will be increasingly important. Luckily for Sprout, this is already one of their strong points. Out of 1,326 reviews, [Sprout has maintained a user score of 4.3 / 5 stars](https://www.g2.com/products/sprout-social/reviews). 

Customer retention should over time reduce marketing and sales spending, as this is such a large component of their total expenses. In 2019, marketing and sales spending represented more than 45% of total expenses.

Keeping this amount in check over time should significantly increase the chance of profitability.

## Threats

Sprout’s primary threat is its inability to gain significant market share. Its marketing spend appears to be less effective than its competitor Hubspot. 

Hubspot expands its selling and marketing expenses by roughly 25-30% per year, whereas Sprout’s expands at roughly 50% per year. Despite this, Hubspot is growing at a comparable rate to Sprout even though it controls roughly 6x as much market share.

If Sprout is unable to gain more market share in a reasonable time period going forward, profitability will be out of reach. Their cash burn rate for 2019 was nearly 33%, and without more rounds of funding they could be facing a liquidity problem within a few years.  


Financial Model & Valuation  


We used assumptions that forecasted revenues at growing at a consistent rate from 50% CAGR to 17% CAGR over a ten year period. Because of our assumptions above, we forecasted Sprout's marketing and advertising expenses at a high rate going forward as well.  


Our outcome was that Sprout was significantly overvalued. For a look at our exact numbers we used and to test your own, please send us a message and we will provide the model for your use to value Sprout.

t3_jgtf1h,Is there a bull case for coal in the near term?,"I don't have any insight on this because I have no idea of how much capacity can be switched from gas back to coal. 

I think there's a pretty well socialized bull case on natural gas and the corresponding equities given declines in associated gas production. You can see the market has reacted appropriately with some natural gas stocks up significantly (>3x) from their March lows. However, I'm assuming at some point with HH now above $3  we could see some gas to coal switching to the horror of the current ESG trend permeating through the market. 

Anyone on the utils or commodity side hear anything about this? Coal stocks (ARCH, ARLP, BTU, CEIX) are still hovering near or below March lows. Estimates across the Street seem to have 2021 only up marginally from 2020 implying I am completely wrong here as well.",6,0.63,1603479613.0
t3_ji0i4d,How to profit off Global Warming: HVAC Market Research with Due Dilligence on 5 Air-Conditioner brands.,"# If you find this interesting please follow my account for more DD.

# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!

**Introduction**

With the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. 

**Finding our compatible companies.** 

I only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) 

1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)

2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). 

3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). 

4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). 

5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)

**Understanding the HVAC market.**

Before we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.

Some facts: 

1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. 

2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. 

3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).

4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.

5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).

6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.

As can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.

\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.

\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.

\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.

\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.

\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.

\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.

**Market share.**

This was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:

\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.

\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.

\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.

\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.

\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%

My conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.

**Conclusion**

First of all, I should start with saying that Lennox really shouldn’t have been included, they are on a completely different level than these 4 other companies. Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.

Looking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:

\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.

\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.

\- Daikin spends the most on R&D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.

\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.

\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.

\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise

\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.

\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. 

\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio

\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.

\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M

Now on to the less financial aspect of the data.

I really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.

To conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",153,0.91,1603657707.0

The investor group is making a visit to the company and will have an audience with the CEO and several other key members of the organization. 

I would like to put a list of questions together that might be relevant to me, the investor. 

This company is involved in rapidly charging battery technology. They have gone through their Series A and B rounds and have completed all their fundraising, and are working toward executing the purchase orders they’ve received, procuring grant monies, continuing to develop technology, marketing themselves to companies like Tesla and cell phone companies, and things of that nature. 

Our investment is in the form of a convertible loan. The company is current with all interest payments. Our main questions are obviously geared toward profitability as well as the timeline for when our interest in the firm will convert to ownership shares. We will also ask questions regarding revenue projections, profitability, and other debt structures than ours.

t3_jljszn,What we found after analyzing Hollysys Automation for more than 6 months," 

As a value investor, one of the things I look out for is a catalyst for price realisation. After all, even if a stock is criminally undervalued, if it does not have something in its future that will cause other people to wake up to its value, it could stay undervalued forever. Today I’m going to talk about a company that has a very clear catalyst which the value, as well as price of the stock, hinges upon. If the catalyst is positive, the upside is enormous, with the stock possibly doubling or tripling almost overnight.

It all started about 6 months ago when I decided to analyse automation. The coming 4th Industrial Revolution will see human-performed tasks being done by robots, and companies that provide these automation services could do very well indeed. After a quick screen, Hollysys Automation Technologies immediately jumped out at me: the company presented itself with spectacular financials characterized by high liquidity; low debt; steadily growing FCF/revenue/net income over the decade; consistent book value; an average ROE of 15% over a decade, ROCE 13%, a stock price trading at a 30-50% discount compared to competitors, and DCF models estimating a value of $30-40 (currently trading about $11). In other words, the dream of any value investor.

I will be the first to admit I don’t have as much knowledge in the automation industry as I’d like – and that’s something I’ve been working on over the past few months. So, after a quick look at their impressive financial statements, our next step was to talk to the IR of the various Hollysys competitors to better understand the competitive environment that Hollysys were operating in, and whether they could preserve their impressive return ratios over the long term.

As a quick overview of the company, Hollysys operates in two segments: industrial automation and railway automation. In industrial, most of the company’s revenue comes from automating fossil fuel energy plants. It would not be unfair to compare it to a defence company or a public contractor, since the Chinese Communist Party controls the state railways and owns a 75% stake in SINOPEC, China's largest and most important oil company. In addition, the company also has a dominant market position in safety systems for nuclear power plants in China, a sector that is growing with a CAGR of 17%, bringing the number of reactors in the country from 16 in 2012 to 56 in 2020. As the only certified provider of nuclear automation services in the country, HOLI has a monopoly in this subsector.

In the railway sector they hold a 30% market share, and they do not expect further increases in market share. Long-term organic revenue growth is likely to be 5%, primarily coming from after-sale services. However, they are actively researching new products such as CBTC (Communications-based train control) in subways, smart systems on highways, etc. If these products gain traction, which they should, then growth will be higher. Also, the company proved to have a great competitive advantage in the high-speed railway field as they are 1 of the 3 approved providers in 300-350km/h segment and 200-250km/h and the largest company in terms of ATP (on board equipment) sets.

In their ‘Smart factories’ subsegment, they provide solutions to accelerate product development cycles for large white goods companies like Haier. They provide integrated data collection products like SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), data utilisation and analysing services to understand the application situations, designing the system architecture, data management and so on, being the largest company in terms of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. Another example of this subsegment of industrial automation would be their contract with Diaobignshan where they used to collect data to build a factory virtually and rapidly iterated designs to optimise efficiencies at low cost. They provide after-build services such as combustion optimization, equipment monitoring and maintenance, etc. This segment generates real tangible returns for customers, with higher production efficiencies and lower cost. However, it’s worth noting that some of their revenue in this segment comes from fossil fuel companies as well, so a surge in renewable builds could see revenue dropping even more than it would appear at first glance.

All the segments that Hollysys operates in have been growing impressively for the past few years, at a rate above even the high growth of the general Chinese economy. To fuel their supply-side based growth, fossil fuel plants have been opening across China at an unprecedented rate, while China’s high-speed railway network has gone from virtually non-existent 15 years ago to being 2/3rds of the entire world’s track length. As Chinese wages rise, the pressure on factory owners to automate is also increasing to stave off price competition from South-East Asian competitors.

So far, the situation all looks good from a high-level company view. But when you either zoom out to look at the macro environment, or in to look at the specifics of the business, cracks begin showing.

The situation with the Chinese government is tricky – and not for the reason you might think. Despite the fact that most of HOLI’s revenue comes from state-owned entities, and it’s monopolistic market position also dependent on the government, we do not see the government introducing competition to the market to drive down prices as a big threat. China has applied a protect-and-nurture strategy for domestic companies in every sector you could think of very successfully, creating such behemoths as Tencent and Alibaba. You prevent superior foreign competition from entering the market, and choose a winner for each sector, allowing it to take monopolistic profits to accelerate the rate of innovation and shorten the timeline that it needs to compete with foreign companies. From the past decade, Hollysys is the chosen winner for the sectors that it competes in, and that the threat of increased competition due to the Chinese government is virtually non-existent. Companies like Siemens or ABB still have objectively superior products and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Until HOLI catches up with them and can compete in a global free market, the handholding from the government will not end.

However, while the Chinese government will not introduce competition to the markets that HOLI competes in, whether it will continue to incentivise those markets is another question entirely. In a recent Chinese government conference, China firmly stated that it would become carbon neutral by 2060 (pay attention: NET carbon emissions will be equal to 0, and not TOTAL emissions, which is quite different). I have no doubt that this will happen – the largest benefit of a single-party state is that these long-term plans can be set in stone and executed upon decades in advance, something which China has been doing since the ways of Deng. And quite obviously, there is consequently a very real threat to the heavily polluting fossil fuel-based power plants that HOLI derives a lot of its revenue from. Banning the construction of new fossil fuel plants is an obvious way to reach this target, but whether China chooses to do this or to find alternative methods of cutting net emissions is less obvious. I would like to remind you that coal consumption, which fell from 2013 to 2017, driven in part by China's willingness to significantly improve air quality, has started to rise again in more recent years as the economy suffered a severe backlash forcing the government to stimulate industrial growth.

Although the government has not released some specifics regarding how these emissions will be reduced, it is thought that this was strongly desired to allow the Communist Party to have the flexibility necessary in the short term to support the economic recovery following the pandemic. Renewables cannot as yet compete with fossil fuels in lifetime cost of operation, and building more fossil plants is a tried-and-true method of giving the economy a shot in the arm, something that any economy could do with right now.

At the same time, future constructions of railways are also uncertain. Most of the tracks laid in recent years is economically unviable, with low demand and a poor populace in these tier-3 cities laying a cap on ticket prices. However, the government views high-speed rail as a socially beneficial alternative to coaches and planes for the hundreds of millions of migrant workers that travel between large cities and the country every holiday, and thus heavily subsidises losses and encouraged more construction in the last 5-year plan. Whether continued construction in both railways and fossil fuel power plants will happen is up in the air and something that we will see in the next 5-year plan, due in March 2021.

A natural response to the threat to fossil fuel power generation automation would be to ask whether Hollysys could simply transition to automating the renewable power generation sector. My research indicates that this is not realistic. The various wind turbines, solar panels, dams, etc. they do not require a complex level of automation like that used in a refinery plan. The latter are huge power plants that occupy hundreds of square meters which require automated processes to obtain the greatest result with the least effort.

^(image from) ^(https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme801/node/4701)

While as regards the structures and machines used for renewable energy, they do not require complicate automated processes such as those used in oil and petrochemical plants; the entire process is enclosed within the turbine itself (as far as wind energy is concerned), so that it becomes almost impossible to state that these types of energy require any automation processes. In the image below I have shown you what the inside of a wind turbine looks like, which differs drastically from the previous image of the refinery plant.

📷 [https://postimg.cc/p9K2mm79](https://postimg.cc/p9K2mm79)

^(image from) ^(https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/inside-wind-turbine)

A field of application, which is very different from the one discussed above, could be to offer automation processes for the companies that produce the different solar panels, wind turbines and so on. This, however, has nothing to do with the automation processes used in oil and petrochemical businesses; here we are dealing with real industrial processes which cannot be connected to the former since they are completely different fields.

The problem is that we are not sure if Hollysys can provide such solutions and even if it is able, we do not know the time needed for this transition. One of Hollysys' strengths was its vast knowledge in the oil industry, which allowed it to keep various competitors away, but this advantage will not be reflected in the renewable sector since they have no knowledge in this field and, and from what I’ve seen, the company has not shown any interest in this sector, neither from the various conference calls held in the past nor from the annual or quarterly reports, which suggests management is either unaware of the threat or incapable of addressing it. The fact that management accounts for some fossil fuel plant automation revenue in ‘smart factories’ suggests the latter, and that they’re trying to make it look less serious than it is.

We are not saying that the company is in danger of failure, since it still has two other revenue streams to rely on, but we will certainly see a decrease in revenues (in 2019, 41% of revenues derive from automation sector, of those 41%, 40% are from oil industries) and a deterioration in the relationship with the Chinese government.

Overall, the conclusion can be drawn that if the coming 5-year plan is unfavourable to Hollysys, the company will face serious setbacks to its short and long-term prospects as the market is pricing in, while a positive 5-year plan that encourages construction of both fossil fuel plants and railways would be hugely accretive to the value of the company. My personal stance is to wait and see what the 5-year plan says – with a small-cap Chinese stock like this, the market is unlikely to immediately react and fully reprice Hollysys on positive news, allowing me a chance to get in after the future is secure even if I miss out some gains. The uncertainty regarding the possible downside to a company is something I hate, although if you have more stomach for risk and think the 5-year plan will be friendly to HOLI, you could jump in now.

If you are positive enough to jump in now you may find interesting that in my positive-scenario-model, I therefore attribute to the automation sector a CAGR of about 5% for the next 10 years, the railway sector a CAGR of 5-6% (assuming continued construction in the next 5-year plan) and attribute to the nuclear sector a CAGR of 12-15% given the enormous progress made in this particular sector in the last 10 years. The final stock price would be something between $25-30 but only if Hollysys starts to be valued with the same multiples of its peers and Chinese government postpones its good intentions to reduce their carbon impact on the rest of the world in order to sustain Chinese’s economy recovery.

Other important facts concerning the company:

* About 3 months ago the ex-CEO Baiqing Shao was changed, who has held the role for more than 7 years and was one of the founders of the company, with a member of the company's directors, Mr Colin Shang. The reasons for this decision were not entirely transparent, as the company initially stated that the CEO had left office and remained on good terms with the company, but in the latest quarterly report the company states the following:**""Dispute in connection with the ownership of Ace Lead Profits Limited ("" Ace Lead "") may adversely impact us.""** *We were made aware of a shareholder’s dispute regarding ownership of one of the principal shareholders. In August 2016, Mr. Changli Wang, the then sole shareholder of Ace Lead, one of our record shareholders, transferred his single share in Ace Lead to Mr. Baiqing Shao for a nominal consideration. As of the date hereof, Ace Lead owns 4,144,223 ordinary shares of our company, representing 6.9% of the outstanding shares of our company. We were recently notified that Mr. Wang indicated that, as Mr. Shao had stepped down as the chairman and chief executive officer of our company since July 2020, he should no longer be entitled to any share in Ace Lead and he should immediately transfer the share in Ace Lead to one or more persons designated by Mr. Wang. As of the date of this annual report, Mr. Shao has not transferred the share in ACE Lead to any designees of Mr. Wang. We cannot predict the outcome of the dispute. If Mr. Shao refuses to transfer the share in ACE Lead to a person designated by Mr. Wang, the dispute could escalate and litigation may ensue between Mr. Shao and Mr. Wang, and our company may become involved. Any escalation of this dispute, including potential litigation, may cause us to incur significant time, resources and cost if we were to become involved.*  
As easily understood this does not seem a ""friendly"" decision by the old CEO, moreover with 7% of the shares in circulation he can do much more damage to the company by attending the shareholders' meetings, being one of the shareholders with the highest participation .
* Many impairments of goodwill. The M&E refers to two companies they bought, Concord and Bond. They are based in Singapore and Malaysia. But their business spread in south east Asian and middle east. Before COVID-19, the macro-economy situation in those areas was not good, and then COVID-19 brought new challenges. Therefore, their management expects future lower profit in M&E. They also do not give guidance on the development of M&E since the company think risk control is the key focus, rather than revenue growth.
* When they got asked what they thought about Trump will to delist Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges they said that they are evaluating recent issues that may potentially affect their status as a Nasdaq-listed company and it is prudent to say that they do not exclude that option. So, no real answer was given about that, which makes me think that they do not have any plan for the near future.
* IR is slow to respond to investors. I sent two emails, the first of which was generally positive and the second follow-up which raised some of the issues discussed in this article. IR has not responded to the second for more than a month, which makes me very uncomfortable.

Also, I wanted to give you a feedback on what Hollysys has to say about this matter but investor relator has not replied to my email for more than 1 month, this gives you a clue on how bad their communication with investors is. On the other hand, I have scheduled another call with one of their competitors on 18 November to talk about what can be done for companies like these to keep up with the almost sure transition that China will experience in the following years.",54,0.85,1604156439.0

\- Weibo’s ad load is only 7-8% vs Toutiao’s and Facebook Asia’s 12%. Weibo’s CPM and cost-per click are significantly below those of Toutiao. Altogether, there should be scope to increase revenue / MAU by about 100%. In addition, monthly active user numbers continue to grow almost 10% per year.

t3_ju2hlv,Travel Recovery writeups #3: Dufry AG,"Hiya all! I've been greatly appreciative of the words of encouragement and constructive feedback given by r/SecurityAnalysis regarding writeups on Booking Holdings ($BKNG) and Hostelworld ($HSW.L). Hopefully y'all find this to be a good read and, as always, I look forward to the good discussions and pieces of feedback in the thread. 😊

# TL;DR

As the world’s largest operator of airport duty-free stores, Dufry ($DUFRY) has suffered alongside previous businesses covered: Booking Holdings ($BKNG) and Hostelworld Group ($HSWLF). Unlike those businesses, Dufry is not a secular growth play, but a Cyclical. Suppression of its valuation caused by the costs of expansion and slowing sales growth have been compounded by a collapse in global travel. This likely forms a bottom in the cycle. An enhanced financial position; vectors enabling further Asian expansion; and recent positive vaccine news has caused a dramatic upswing. Though stretched from its fundamentals, Dufry offers significant potential upside to investors banking on a travel recovery and willing to withstand short-term volatility as gravity returns to its valuation.

# 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW

&#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Performance of Dufry AG visualised through annual revenue, operating profit, and share price performance over the past decade. Source: Dufry AG financials and GuruFocus.](https://preview.redd.it/4148u4iqq7z51.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecdbb32ea16c1e700b5fe396e3eb5a3ce44de490)

First, a short business overview. Dufry operates mainly as an airport retailer, representing 88% of 2019A revenues. This article’s focus lies here. Its decade-long “global ambition” has centred on increasing scale via acquisitions, which has boosted airport retail market share to \~20%. This [M&A push](https://www.dufry.com/en/company/our-retail-brands) continues amid current challenges; fully [acquiring](https://www.dufry.com/en/press_release/2020-08-19/dufry-plans-acquire-all-remaining-equity-interest-hudson-and-delist-hudson) American-focussed unit, Hudson ($HUD), in August 2020 – signalling confidence or ego. Beyond, management has set its sights on Asian growth, buoyed by Alibaba’s ($BABA) recent 10% stake. There is a good reason for this, as Asian travel spend only [grows in significance](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/partner-with-us/documents/global-travel-and-tourism-insights-by-visa.pdf). Here, luxury goods’ demand is expected to [double by 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/china/the-chinese-luxury-consumer). Presently, its main geographic exposure is the Americas and Europe; areas where air travel will take [longest to recover](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-07-28-02/).

# 2. OPPORTUNITY

Figure 1 shows increases in sales and profit have not been reflected in Dufry’s valuation, which is now at an \~70% discount to its highs in 2017. There are several possible explanations. Chiefly, growth in operating cashflows are being offset by financing costs incurred by their acquisition-heavy strategy. Motive for consolidation is rational, as scale means Dufry can leverage its distribution network for better pricing and synergistic cost-benefits. Yet, cost-cutting has only yielded a 1.61% gross margin improvement from 2016-2020. Shareholders have yet to meaningfully benefit from their “[global ambition\[s\]](https://www.dufry.com/en/annual-report-2019/focus-story)”. 

An additional explanation for its persistent struggles is that Dufry, like almost all of retail, has a cyclical business. I propose this was somewhat overlooked by [past bullish coverage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4186389-dufry-secular-trends-and-valuation-point-to-60-upside) on Seeking Alpha. Its cyclical nature means investors are [constantly looking ahead](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/tutorial/peter-lynchs-final-investment-checklist/). As Peter Lynch [writes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/762462.One_Up_On_Wall_Street): “timing is everything with cyclicals”. In hindsight, growth sluggishness was a sign that the ‘recovery story’ of this cyclical was over well before COVID-19 – perhaps this story now repeats itself.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Back-of-the-napkin forecast of Dufry AG. Source: Author’s calculations. ](https://preview.redd.it/5g1ccqvvo7z51.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=297cbab9d24798ceb32968e47fc9482e3443afe0)

Management expects sales to recover by 2022 and lays out three scenarios for 2020: Best (-40% YoY), Base (-55% YoY), and Worst (-70%) YoY. A 2022 recovery seems unlikely, as the [International Air Travel Association (IATA) forecasts a 2024 recovery](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-07-28-02/) in passengers. Another variable is the premium investors are willing to pay. The P/S ratio paid during the ‘uptrend’ period (2010-2014) was higher than during the ‘stagnation’ (2015-2019) and ‘downtrend’ (2019-2020) periods. Anticipation for the end of the business cycle explains these reductions in premia. Expect higher premia being paid, should a recovery be conceivable. These assumptions inform projections laid out in Figure 4.

# 3. RECOVERY RISK FACTORS

For Dufry, a recovery in its business and stock requires a revival in global air travel and travel spending. Previously highlighted, a 2024 recovery in passengers is expected by the IATA. The Americas and [Europe](https://www.consultancy.eu/news/4337/europe-needs-five-years-to-reach-pre-corona-air-travel-levels), accounting for 40% and 44% of 2019A sales, will lag on [revised forecasts](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/european-flights-waning-as-rebound-reverses-eurocontrol-says). Concurrently, a -70% change YoY in [international arrivals](https://www.unwto.org/market-intelligence#:~:text=Based%20on%20current%20trends%2C%20economic,tourist%20arrivals%20worldwide%20in%202020.) is expected. Domestic tourism has been a bright spot, but spending is [significantly higher](https://blog.accessdevelopment.com/tourism-and-travel-statistics-the-ultimate-collection) for international tourism – travel-related expenses disproportionately account towards this.

Aside from obvious uncertainties regarding the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines – and if this translates to traveller confidence – consumer strength during the ‘recovery’ phase is crucial. Fortunately, consumer confidence has held-up well in the West so far. “Pent-up demand” due to forced saving across Spring/Summer has led to [positive surprises](https://www.ft.com/content/cdfac23e-f27d-44fd-9fc2-92fe0769e77c) in economic data. This may bode well for travel spending in 2021, however, continued small-business struggles weigh on the incomes of the approximately [1 in 2 persons employed therein](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/WDN-20180627-1) as well as the possibility of further lockdowns, remain.

So far, a picture is painted of short-term pain but long-term opportunity. Yet, aside from the important and frequently quantified variables which will influence future valuations of Dufry, an esoteric question should be asked: upon reopening, what will airports look like? Airport design will no doubt radically change in the coming years. [Architecturally](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2020/06/18/the-future-of-airport-design-after-covid-19-according-to-an-airport-architect/#3150beb13919), space allotted to Check-In will decrease, as Security and Terminal become more spread out. For Dufry, omnichannel strategies will become vital. World Duty Free stores have [begun](https://airport.nridigital.com/air_aug20/seamless_travel_airport) to offer “concierge” services, where customers browse in-store and receive items delivered – where the Alibaba joint-venture is likely pivotal. It is uncertain if customers will adopt this, but such a strategy seems apt following recent [booms in domestic duty-free shopping](https://www.amtrav.com/blog/2018/04/05/domestic-duty-free-shopping-a-new-trend) as domestic travel recovers first.

# 4. FINANCIAL STRENGTH

&#x200B;

[Figure 3: Table showing financial position of Dufry, regarding payment of liabilities. Source: Author's calculations.](https://preview.redd.it/1nmpkl5fp7z51.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b380a8c1de306fde78dc2abc951ff5b5e54bcdd)

It is unsurprising that Dufry turned to the financial market for support. A [recent rights issue](https://www.dufry.com/en/press_release/2020-10-20/dufry-announces-final-number-and-offer-price-new-shares-be-issued) raised CHF 820M, with Advent International and Alibaba receiving most equity. Much of this cash will finance the CHF \~283M [Hudson acquisition](https://www.dufry.com/en/press_release/2020-08-19/dufry-plans-acquire-all-remaining-equity-interest-hudson-and-delist-hudson), with the rest there to steady the ship. Dufry’s [total liquidity](https://www.dufry.com/en/press_release/2020-11-03/continued-gradual-improvements-third-quarter-2020-dufry-successfully) now sits at CHF 2,065M. In a scenario of -70% 2020 sales, monthly operational cash burn is estimated at [CHF 60M per month](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4363958-dufry-ag-dufry-ceo-julian-diaz-on-q2-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=8). Therefore, Dufry has conceivably approximately 34 months of liquidity at the current status quo.

# 5. VALUATION

Figure 2 shows a valuation using multiples and projected sales. A more conservative DCF model is shown in Figure 4 and its assumptions in Figure 5.

[ Figure 4: Sensitivity analysis of outputs of discounted cash flow model of Dufry in a BULL scenario. PV for BASE and BEAR are CHF 32 and CHF 28, respectively. Source: Author's calculations.](https://preview.redd.it/qas3vajop7z51.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=47d4713c31f668606aed7f6001dc7647d8c10ace)

[ Figure 5: Input assumptions for Figure 2 and Figure 4. Source: Author's calculations. ](https://preview.redd.it/l0e5hk8vp7z51.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4cf4baa09decc31be5594eba614e4e7de5f2b29)

At market close on Friday 13th November 2020, Dufry is up approximately 30% this week. Encouraging COVID-19 [vaccine developments](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/pfizer-covid-vaccine-travel-companies-see-it-as-welcomed-step-.html) from Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) have spurred notion of a Travel & Tourism recovery. The swiftness of this move means there is little to gain by chasing this rally. Historically examining the speed of Dufry’s recovery in 2009, conceivably there remains significant upside (Figure 2). Yet, Figure 3 otherwise suggests that Dufry has become detached from its fundamentals and therefore presents minimal margin of safety in the short-term.

# 6. CONCLUSION

In making conclusions about a business experiencing an “[event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2urunw4EU)”, it is wise to consider what we know and what we don’t know.

**What we know**: Operationally, a persistent management team means Dufry continues to eye expanding their global presence. Asia is integral to this and Alibaba has recently acquired a 10% stake, suggesting that initial steps are being taken. Financially, its capitally intensive growth strategy coupled with the collapse in 2020 travel demand has necessitated recent capital raises by Dufry. These have significantly enhanced its liquidity, which has been used not only to shore up balance sheets but acquire smaller, struggling peers.

**What we don’t know**: Current sentiment leans toward a swift recovery in travel however it remains uncertain when passengers will be comfortable travelling again, and what form it takes. [Past articles published](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4357766-booking-holdings-disparate-risks-in-short-term-and-long-term) suggest vacation habits quickly resume after a shock but cash-strapped travellers may limit non-essential travel expenses – sadly that Lagavulin 16-year is superfluous.

Dufry as of 13th November is optimistically traded by the market. This is unsurprising; as money is made with Cyclicals during the predictable uptrend. Looking outward, a range of CHF 80-150 is representative of history however its current valuation opens Dufry up for future downside in the short-term. Still, this remains an attractive option to play a potential travel recovery.

t3_jxam5x,Investment opportunities in tech companies who adopt this go-to-market strategy,"Hi,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.

# Bottom-Up Software Sales

The ""bottom up"" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.

The premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.

For example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.

There are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.

# What's so special about bottom-up?

There are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.

&#x200B;

* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.
* **More money for R&D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  
   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....
* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.
* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.

## What to look for in a bottom-up company

Not all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

* **Look for a ""receptive"" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.
* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.
* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.
* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.
* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.

## Bottom-Up Companies

Below are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).

### Asana ($ASAN):

Asana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.

I like Asana for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.
2. **R&D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.
3. **Product & design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.
4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.

### Slack ($WORK) :

Slack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.

I like Slack for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.
2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottom-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.
3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottom-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.

### Honourable Mentions:

Below are some more bottom-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.

&#x200B;

1. Zoom ($ZM)
2. Atlassian ($TEAM)
3. Datadog ($DDOG)
4. Zendesk ($ZEN)
5. Hubspot ($HUBS)
6. Docusign ($DOCU)

t3_jwtnxd,Blackrock Capital Market Assumptions - PE returns 3-4x anything else?,"Recently I had reason to review Blackrock's 3Q capital market assumptions ([the most recent update](https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-au/insights/charts/blackrock-capital-markets-assumptions)) and noticed a few things, among them how low the expected nominal returns are for almost anything, and specifically how bearish they are on US large cap equities.

Here's an excerpt from the assumptions:

|Item|Expected Return|Expected Vol|
|:-|:-|:-|
|US Equities|4.1%|16.2%|
|US Core RE|5.9%|12.1%|
|US PE (Buyout)|17.1%|32.0%|
|US HY|3.9%|8.0%|
|US Credit |\-0.1%|6.8%|

A few questions came to mind:

* How is core US real estate higher expected return than US equities? maybe COVID related depression in some markets, but I think of ""core"" US real estate as higher quality multifamily, office, and industrial which is almost bond-like returns.
* US credit is -0.1% nominal returns? Any way to get to this conclusion other than expecting significantly higher interest rates in the next 5 years?
* And oddest of all, is that US private equity is a massive outlier. Look at the chart. 4x US large cap returns. I get that it should be higher due to leverage, but 4x higher? Many studies have shown that after fees, private equity on average doesn't perform much better (unless you go back to early days with smaller funds and few competitors) than public equity portfolios. Also I don't think US PE has ever had industry returns like that with the exception of pre 2000s KKR, BX, etc.
   * BLK's comment on why this might be is highly contradictory:  ""Richer valuations for equities, particularly in the U.S. and in emerging markets (EM) following the rally, have lowered our expected returns for the asset class. Our private equity expected returns have risen due to cheaper valuations and higher average economic growth expectations over the next five years. ""

I'm curious if anyone here has been involved in the sausage making behind these assumptions. I know that these things need to be taken with a grain of salt, but still - how do they reach some of these conclusions?

t3_jz3454,How do you forecast uncertain inputs used in your valuations?,"So this is a question I asked in a few threads and didn't get a lot of responses. So I figured I should ask here to get some insight from the broader r/SecurityAnalysis reader base. 

I have a sense that some people here might say that forecasting inputs that are inherently uncertain might be speculation but as I spend more time valuing companies, I've come to the conclusion that there are various ""degrees"" of speculation. 

Anyways, a few inputs that feed into your valuation might be the following: 

* Company says that they are trying to build a sustainable competitive advantage - will they be successful at it take something so qualitative and convert it into numbers for your valuation? 
* Turnarounds - the company in question been doing poor historically but decided to change strategy/ops or whatever it is about their business - how do you forecast the likelihood of success and magnitude? 
* Companies shifting to a digital strategy 
* Company doing R&D?
* Anything that a company is doing that there isn't any past data for? 

&#x200B;

Hope this helps forward the discussion on valuation and Security Analysis. Hopefully the advice on this  thread can help those doing valuation on an underperfoming company, where the C-Suite is promising that their turnaround strategy will work.

t3_jyp6xz,Short thesis on Big Lots ($BIG),"Disclaimer: I am short Big Lots. A small short position but a position nonetheless.

I was curious to what was happening with the company because they're trading at a very low P/E and I figured that this may be a value stock just off of that alone but I dug into their most recent 10-K and found some thing that turned a potential long thesis into a short thesis. Why I'm short $BIG:

\-Adjusted for buybacks, their capital base has grown faster than EPS and FCF. They need more money to return little to shareholders. They've bought back stock at aggressive paces, reducing outstanding shares by almost 50% since 2010. This move has levered the company as buybacks lower the cost of capital (to a point) but they have a lot of debt now so either they issue shares, diluting returns, or take out more debt, which is problematic in itself. More on that later. Even if you leave buybacks there and don't add them back then you still have the same exact problem. Their capital base has grown faster than EPS and FCF growth.

\-The new CEO, Bruce Thorn, recently left Mens Wearhouse and they're getting ready to leave restructuring bankruptcy. I'm not going to throw all that blame on him as that would be unfair. The various economic headwinds that Mens Wearhouse faced due to Amazon and the like aren't fair to throw onto a management team. But you have to look at who is running the company. That much can't be ignored. I'm immediately raising eyebrows if a CEO left a company and that company is in financial trouble and goes to run a new company.

\-Total debt has grown 14.88% while total asset have grown only 7.82% over the past ten years. DSI has grown from 60.34 days in 2017, bloating to 67.56 days in FY2019, to 63.16 days in FY2020. They make a lot of their sales from furniture and home decor, thins that people aren't readily buying every single day so I have to keep in mind that a high DSI may be reasonable based on what they sell. But COVID has backed up supply chains for receiving furniture to sell and DSI was rising when there was a bull market. How are they going to get bad inventory off of their books now when COVID is causing closures to their stores and their supply chains? Consignment sales? Who is going to buy it? Inventory write downs? Market won't like that. Reducing their prices? Cut their margins and the market won't like that. 

\-Last year alone selling their distribution center in CA made up 53% of EBIT last fiscal year. Pull that out and EBIT and net income saw a massive decline. This isn't the first time that selling distribution centers has made up large chunks of EBIT. You can only sell a property once so even if you're fine with them doing that to boost EBIT you still have the problem of it being a one time event. They've been entering into a lot of leaseback transactions as well that I think ultimately obscure low quality earnings and cash flow. How many more properties can they sell off to boost EBIT? They have a massive store footprint already at 1,400 stores. They're economically profitable at gross margins around 40% with little standard deviation over the past decade. They can make money in their sleep. Looking down the income statement tells you that they can't hold onto it for long because EBIT margins don't even outpace historical inflation rates.

\-Ollie's, their most direct competitor, has 12.2% EBIT margins. In their proxy statement's peer compensation section their don't see Ollie's as part of their ""peer"" market though. They seem to think they compete alongside companies like Tractor Supply (8.3%), DICK'S Sporting Goods (4.3%), Advance Auto Parts (7.0%), L Brands (7.6%), Dollar General (8.3%), and Five Below (11.8%). Look at all their EBIT margins and they still fall so short of EBIT margins against their competitors. $BIG had 2.9% EBIT margin this past year. Even if I agree with them that their peer compensation review creates an accurate market for them to compete in they still, by the list they've created, fall far away from being peers to them in this regard.

\-CA, FL, TX, and OH gave them 33% of net sales in FY2020. OH and CA just announced curfews to control COVID outbreaks and I suspect FL and TX will be forced to deal with COVID outbreaks later on in the same way. Ignoring it means more deaths and ultimately they will have to do something to curb infection rates. Big Lots aims to sell to the JCPenny demographic, the ""I want more bang for my buck/I want to feel like I'm getting a deal at your expense"" crowd. This crowd is hurting badly from unemployment rates being high and government financial support being low. What cash do they think their customers have to pay for furniture that they couldn't sell when the economy was doing good? I don't see them making those sales back soon enough to fix problems the business has. Apollo Management was aiming to take them private but the leaseback transactions that Big Lots was doing at the time of those talks made Apollo drop the idea. It seems Big Lots may be left to flounder in the public markets for a little while longer.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: This company makes money in its sleep with high gross margins but management can't seem to keep a lot of it in the business due to poor corporate governance. Aggressive buybacks over the past ten years has levered the company up at the worst time to be levered in 2020 and they've been struggling to get inventory out of their stores in good times, let alone during bad times.

&#x200B;

This is my first short thesis. Please critique, comment, revise, insult, I don't care. But make me better at this. I've been teaching myself investing for the past few years so whatever you can do to help me be better at short or long picks please let me know.",52,0.94,1606017836.0
t3_k0fjiq,Oil is probably a value play (finally),"I think we're finally at the point where oil is in firm value territory now and wanted to lay the macro environment out for others. There were a couple false starts between 2015 and now, but the risk is now weighted to the upside, in my opinion.

Let's be clear, oil E&Ps are ultimately a bet on the oil price with few exceptions, so essentially everyone should stay far far away unless you have some serious conviction in your oil price call which I do not recommend. The exception, in my mind, are royalty companies. Royalties are great businesses. They don't have the torque of oil companies but they're legitimate businesses that make money regularly. If you want to have some exposure to the sector, which much less risk and volatility, this is where it is. Nearly every company in the royalty sector appears very cheap with FCF yields ranging from 8-15% on low oil price decks. These are the types of businesses that should trade at low yields (probably not above 8%) because of the certainty of cash flow and much lower liquidity risk.

Back to oil. To set the stage, I think some basics around where oil demand and supply are at. Pre-pandemic oil demand was around 100 mmbbl/d and you'd see large swings in oil prices when the market was 1 mmbbl/d+ over/undersupplied. Pre-pandemic OPEC was essentially holding oil rangebound in the $50-60 range with some small deviations outside of that. The pandemic absolutely demolished oil demand which is why we saw oil go negative (20-30 mmbbl/d of demand destroyed at its peak). Now, I can't say for sure where we are on the demand side, but currently India and China are at demand levels **above** where they were pre-pandemic. The major volumes that need to return to the market relate to flying and to a lesser extent from driving. My guess is we're likely somewhere between 90-95 mmbbl/d in oil demand right now, I don't think the specifics really matter because the main thing that matters is where we are on the other side of COVID. Demand is almost certain to come within 3% of pre-pandemic levels, with 3% being my low case and above pre-pandemic levels being the high case (baked in are assumptions of an initial demand burst of flying, as well as some structural changes to people using less transit). Now, returning to pre-pandemic levels, or within 3% of pre-pandemic volumes doesn't sound very bullish until you look at the supply side.

Oil supply has been also been hit pretty hard on a relative basis. It might not sound like much, but oil supply has likely decreased somewhere in the range of 4-6 mmbbl/d due to COVID. US volumes alone are 2-3 mmbbl/d below where they were pre-pandemic due to shale's massive decline rates and shut-ins which will never return. There's at least another 1 mmbbl/d of supply offline from other shut-ins that will never return, and this still doesn't account for the declines of other oilfields which have seen limited drilling since March. The US rig count is at \~300 right now, which is ridiculously low (800 pre-pandemic) meaning you shouldn't be expect a massive inflow from shale anytime soon.

Where does that leave us? We will likely be at 97 mmbbl/d of oil demand (on my low case for demand) vs 96 mmbbl/d of oil supply (on my high case for supply). That means we will not be at $40-45 WTI for very long once vaccine rollouts start positively impacting global travel and work patterns. I think we will see some stops and starts in the meantime due to second waves of COVID having some demand impacts and OPEC rolling off curtailments earlier than expected if the supply/demand picture improves. We also have the lack of capital available to oil companies underpinning the supply picture. US companies were starting to struggle pre-pandemic as well costs and the uneconomic nature of the marginal barrel of shale at $55/bbl finally caught up. COVID has completely destroyed the sector and every investor still hates the sector because of it. Ramping up production will not start happening until we see $55 WTI at the earliest, in my opinion. No one will be willing to lend/provide much equity until that point because the past 5 years oil has only burned investors. Additional regulations on US shale from the Biden admin also provides some minor tailwinds, but I think this won't be nearly as material as the inherent supply/demand mismatch we will see.

Risks:

\- Iran production coming back online. It's hard to say how much more Iran production could come back online if sanctions were lifted by the US. It's likely in the 1.5-2.0 mmbbl/d range which could provide some headwinds, but I don't think it keeps oil from going to $55.

\- Vaccine rollouts are slower than expected. The longer travel demand remains suppressed, the longer oil prices will linger.

\- Another OPEC price war/reducing curtailments. I think initial impacts from OPEC rolling off sanctions will overstate the impact because I don't think the spare capacity will be enough to cover the demand shortfall. This is a pretty big unknown because it's hard to put a specific number on this at this point.

Curious to hear other thoughts - but I think oil has largely been left for dead, evidenced by the European majors essentially abandoning oil and using oil price decks that make very few projects economic.

**TL;DR:** COVID-19 has thrown oil demand/supply balance out of whack, doesn't seem like anyone cares because everyone hates the sector due to the past 5 years.

Disclaimer: Please don't take this as any sort of investment advice. It's not. Don't invest in oil unless you want to (probably) lose money.",22,0.77,1606257646.0

t3_k0ufql,Long idea: Koshidaka Holdings,"* Operator of karaoke bars throughout Japan under the “Maneki-neko” brand name.
* Lower-end market niche, offering loyalty programs, clean facilities, low prices and allows visitors to bring their own drinks. Many of their karaoke boxes are built around railway stations or population dense urban areas where high utilization rates can be maintained.
* Even though the karaoke industry has been growing slowly over the past decade, Koshidaka has managed to double its market share from 5% to 10%. 
* In early 2020, Koshidaka spun off its fitness segment into Curves Holdings (7085 JP). Given that the 90% of the tax basis was attributed to parent Koshidaka, we believe that most investors chose to sell Koshidaka rather than Curves. Indeed, Curves is now trading at a very high multiple (3.1x sales) and is back to the post-spin initial trading price, whereas Koshidaka’s share price is down over 40%. 
* Capital allocation seems decent. Undertaking Japan's first spin-off is a positive sign. ROE is high and book value has compounded at high rates. 
* COVID-19 has been negative for the karaoke business but boxes are now open again. If a vaccine gets widely distributed, customers are likely to return. 
* Intrinsic value of around JPY 728/share, upside of +82%.

t3_k3x9c4,Hedging Strategies,"Have any fundamental analysts here been effective at putting on hedges over time? (Not interested in day trading perspectives...)

My questions for you include:

1. Do you stick to equity markets, such as put options on overvalued securities?

2. If equity, how do you determine the expiration date and strike price(s)? Do you just use short term options, a few months out, or do you buy longer dated options for 1-2 years away? If longer term, do you have to stick to the indices? There doesn't seem to be much volume for individual names where you might want to bet on a 50% decline, but have to use 2022 because you don't know when the tide will go out.

3. How do you think about hedges? Do you allocate a portion, maybe  1/4-1/2 percent as an annual cost, or do you just hedge when you have specific concerns in varying portfolio allocations?

4. Have you ever taken hedges in currencies or interest rates? If so, what was the learning process like in terms of understanding the mechanics and putting on the correct bet. I'm a fundamental analyst and might have a view on some of these, or at least want to take on tail risk hedges, but have no experience executing trades like this. Can you take on trades that react to a specific interest rate instead of trying to calculate bond values at a particular date? (The further I move away from my circle of competence, the less I'll understand...

Edit: To be clear, I'm looking less for general guidance and more for the technical aspects. I'm versed on the basics (CFA charter, work experience, etc.) and am not dealing with existential questions of whether one should hedge or not...",15,0.88,1606748144.0

t3_k5uelu,Deepmind has deep value for Alphabet?,"I do not want to get too detailed with this post about the importance and value of AI, but I wanted to start a discussion about what is a truly an incredible advancement in AI and the implication on the fourth largest company in the world.  This week, Deepmind from alphabet reported an incredible advancement in the ability to predict folded protein structure from primary sequence.  

See the following for details about the advancement: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4)

In terms of difficulty, the objective of predicting the fold of a protein is  one of the great challenges in science. It is something a number of the best scientists in academia have been trying to achieve. As a scientist who works on protein engineering/structural biology, I cannot believe the ease and level of accuracy with which they are able to do this.  I did not think something like this could be achieved for decades, let alone a couple years after Deepmind decided to apply their technology to it.

I do not think this advancement itself has much commercial value relative to the size of Alphabet (it could bring in a couple million a year via pharma licensing), but by pulling this achievement off, along with their many other fundamental successes, it seems clear to me that Deepmind is the world's leader in AI (rivaled only by openAI).   What is that worth to a company that already has the most access to data for both search (-->smarter ads),  and maps (-->self driving cars)?  How many of their currently unprofitable subsidiaries (e.g. verily, Waymo) are ready to drive value over the next 5-10?  

So I wrote this post not because I understand the implications on Alphabet, but because I'm curious what the rest of you think, especially those of you who actively track the tech sector (I am personally more focused on biotech).",105,1.0,1606989281.0

Hello, welcome to my first deep dive write up.

My  name’s Mark and I’m an accountant with a passion for investing. About  two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm  and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and  privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique  perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a  new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to  help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market  today.

I’m a long-term investor. I  am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time.  I’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book  “100 Baggers” by Chris Mayer.

**Introduction**

I  think it’s fitting that my first stock pick has to do with sports.  Sports has been a part of my life since I could walk at the age of 2.  First with baseball and soccer, and then later in my childhood with  golf. I’ve always played American football and basketball for fun as  well and have always been an avid fan of all the major sports in the US.

I  started playing fantasy sports (mostly just fantasy football) about 6  years ago and have always enjoyed it. Traditionally, with fantasy  football you draft a team at the beginning of the year and those are  your players for the rest of the season. If you have a bad draft, oh  well. You can try to improve your team with trades and free agent  additions but it is tough. Leagues usually consist of 10-14 teams (each  managed by an individual) and there’s obviously only one winner at the  end of the season (about 4 months after the draft). This can lead to the  managers of the lower performing teams losing interest as the season  wanes on. I believe DraftKings’ (DK) founders saw this issue and saw an  opportunity. Enter, daily fantasy sports. Now, with the DK platform you  can draft a new team every week. Or if you want, every day. This allows  fans of fantasy sports to engage at whichever point of the season they  want and at varying financial stakes.

**The Thesis Statement**

For  every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement  that can serve as a reminder for why I’m buying and holding that stock  for the long term. I’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long  so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why  you’re holding this position.

The thesis statement I have come up with for DK is as follows:

*“DraftKings:  The leader in allowing fans to engage financially with their favorite  sports, teams, and players. Having money at stake makes the game a lot  more interesting to watch. The era of daily fantasy sports games, online  sports betting, and online betting (outside of sports), is just getting  started and DK is as well positioned (or better positioned) than anyone  to capitalize off of this trend.”*

Notice  how I said “allowing fans to engage financially” as the first sentence  and not necessarily “allowing fans to gamble”. There’s a reason for  that. According to US Federal Law, Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) contests  have specifically been exempted from the prohibitions of the Unlawful  Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). DK has always been, and I  believe will continue to be DFS contests 1st, sports betting 2nd, and  other forms of gambling/entertainment 3rd.  It is noteworthy that states  at an individual level can still deem DFS contests illegal if they so  wish, but as of this writing (11/26/20), 43 of the 50 US States allow  DFS contests and DK, accordingly, is offering DFS contests in all 43 of  those US States.

I’ll try to clarify the difference between DFS contests and sports betting real quick:

**DFS Contest –**  Pay a pre-set entry fee to enter a contest. All entry fees go towards  “The Pot”. “Draft” 9 players to be on your “Team” for 1 week. Enter your  “Roster” into a contest with other players (could range from 1 other  person to 1,000s of people, the DK user can choose). Whichever “Roster”  amasses the most points for that week out of all contestants wins. The  winner will get the highest payout, and depending on the nature of the  contest, other top finishers will receive smaller payouts as well.

**Sports Gambling –**  Team A is considered a 10 point favorite to defeat Team B. This means  that Team A is expected, by the professional gambling line setters, to  outscore Team B by 10 points. This is known as a point spread. You can  bet on the underdog or the favorite. If you bet on the favorite, they  have to win by more than 10 points for you to win the bet. If you bet on  the underdog, you will win the bet as long as the underdog keeps the  game within less than a 10 point defeat.

These  are just a couple simple examples to help you see the difference.  Sports Gambling (the 2nd priority of DK) is a very lucrative market just  as the DFS contests are. However, in the US, Federal Laws and  regulations are a lot stricter on Sports Gambling than they are on DFS.  As of this writing (11/27/20), 22 states (including the District of  Columbia) out of 51 possible allow sports gambling.

DK  is still in the infancy stages of getting their sports gambling  business going. In the 22 states where they could potentially operate,  they currently have a sports gambling offering in 11 of those states.  The sports gambling business model for DK can be broken into two main  offerings – mobile sports betting, and retail sports betting. Mobile  sports betting means you can place a sports bet online from the comfort  of your own home, while retail sports betting means you must go to a  casino and place a bet with the sportsbook in person. I personally  believe mobile sports betting is the real potential cash cow for DK out  of the two types of sports betting offerings due to the convenience and  ease of access. DK is currently working on and encouraging customers to  lobby their state lawmakers to legalize sports gambling in more states.

**How DK makes money**

At  the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand  how they make money. In Chris Mayers’ excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn’t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I  look at.

For DK, their means of  making money is quite simple. I already went into detail above about DFS  Contests and Sports Gambling. In DK’s latest 10-Q filing with the SEC  (filed 11/13/20), revenue is broken out into two main streams: Online  Gaming and Gaming Software.

**Online Gaming (82% of Total Revenue for 9 months ended 9/30/20):**

Online  gaming is the true core business of DK and includes the aforementioned  DFS Contests, Sports Gambling and additional gambling (non-sports)  opportunities. DK refers to their additional gambling (non-sports) as  “iGaming” or “online casino”.

For  the 9 months ended 9/30/20, Online Gaming revenue totaled $239M, up 30%  YoY from $184M in the same prior year period. Keep in mind, that this is  an increase that happened during a COVID-19 global pandemic that  delayed and shortened many professional sports seasons.

Online  gaming revenue is earned in a few ways that are slightly different, but  very similar overall.  In order to enter a DFS contest, a customer must  pay an entry fee. DFS revenue is generated from these entry fees  collected, net of prize payouts and customer incentives awarded to  users. In order to place a sports bet (sports gambling), a customer  places a wager with a DK Sportsbook. The DK Sportsbook sets odds for  each wager that builds in a theoretical margin allowing DK to profit.  Sports gambling revenue is generated from wagers collected from  customers, net of payouts and incentives awarded to winning customers.  The last form of online gaming revenue is earned in similar fashion to a  land-based casino, offering online versions of casino games such as  blackjack, roulette, and slot machines.

**Gaming Software (18% of Total Revenue for 9 months ended 9/30/20):**

While  the Online Gaming revenue stream mentioned above is a Business to  Consumer (B2C) model, the Gaming Software revenue stream is a Business  to Business (B2B) model. The Gaming Software side of the business was  born out of the acquisition of SBTech, a company from the Isle of Man  (near the UK) founded in 2007 that has 12+ years of experience providing  online sports betting platforms to clients all over the world. The  acquisition occurred as part of the SPAC driven IPO in April of 2020  that combined “the old DK company” with SBTech so that they now are “the  new DK company” listed as DKNG on the NASDAQ. SBTech is a far more  important part of the story than just being 18% of today’s revenue. The  reason for this is because DK will eventually (planned mid-late 2021) be  migrating all of their DFS and gambling offerings onto SBTech’s online  platforms. Currently, for DFS, DK uses their own proprietary platform  but that will move to SBTech with the migration. Currently, for online  gambling, DK uses Kambi, the same online gambling platform that services  Penn Gaming (PENN), a DK rival. But that’s enough about the software  migration for now, back to the Gaming Software revenue.

The  Gaming Software revenue stream for DK is essentially a continuation of  SBTechs’ B2B business model. DK contracts with business customers to  provide sports and casino betting software solutions. DK typically  enters two different type of arrangements with B2B customers when  selling the gaming software:

1. **Direct Customer Contract Revenue:**  In this type of transaction, the software is sold      directly to a  business (casino for example) that wants to use the software      for  their own gambling operations. This revenue is generally calculated as       a percentage of the wagering revenue generated by the business  customer      using DK’s software and is recognized in the periods in  which those      wagering and related activities conclude.
2. **Reseller Arrangement Revenue:**   In this type of transaction, DK provides      distributors with the  right to resell DK’s software-as-a-service offering      to their  clients, using their own infrastructure. In reseller      arrangements,  revenue is generally calculated via a fixed monthly fee and      an  additional monthly fee which varies based on the number of gaming  operators      to whom each reseller sub-licenses DK’s software.

As  mentioned above, SBTech was an international company based in the Isle  of Man before being acquired by DK. Thus, the majority of their business  in their first 12 years of operating independently has always been  international and outside of the United States. This has helped DK,  which has historically been US focused, expand it’s international reach.

A  perfect example of expanding this international reach occurred recently  during October (technically Q4) in which DK’s B2B technology (powered  by SBTech) helped enable the launch of “PalaceBet”, a new mobile and  online sportsbook offering from Peermont, a South Africa based resort  and casino company. The deal was headed by DK’s new Chief International  Officer, Shay Berka, who previously spent 10 years working for SBTech as  CFO and General Manager. Mr. Berka took on the role of DK’s Chief  International Officer upon the merger in April earlier this year. I  think this deal shows that DK has integrated SBTech and it’s business  very well into the larger business as a whole. They are not wasting any  time using their newly acquired resources to expand their reach and  bring in new sources of revenue.

This  is the end of my first article about DK. My goal is to drop Part 2  later this week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the  question – “Can we 10x from here?”

**My Personal Thoughts:**

Semiconductors as a whole from a standpoint of size are reaching a limit on just how small we can get them to be. /u/Beren- recently posted a video about this which I think provides a great summary ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/k4oavq/semiconductors\_the\_ultimate\_bargaining\_chip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/k4oavq/semiconductors_the_ultimate_bargaining_chip/)), but effectively within the next few years or so, traditional methods of manufacturing semiconductors will have reached a hard ceiling. Already, in fact, we are beginning to see signs of this approach (i.e with Intel's 10nm fabbing issues / Global Foundries exit from leading-edge production of 7nm.)

In order to continue growing, a few viable pathways remain like increasingly customized domain-specific architectures, a greater focus on parallel computation, and of course quantum computing. There's plenty to be said on the former\[1\], and I'm sure we'll continue to see great advancements there, but with respect to the problem of size specifically, the only real avenue to breaking past the <2/3nm ceiling is a paradigm shift in manufacturing as well as processing approaches. Quantum mechanics unfortunately allows for nothing less.

\[1\] [https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~cs152/sp19/lectures/L20-DSA.pdf](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs152/sp19/lectures/L20-DSA.pdf)

**Interesting report, but this is** /r/securityanalysis. **I'm not sure this is relevant?:**

A totally reasonable first impression. I've always found valuing ""hard tech"" problems like these myself to be the most difficult, in what already is a challenging industry overall from a valuation perspective.

I think the key points to keep in mind here are that:

1. Traditional semiconductor manufacturing has reached a ceiling on how much more they can improve.
2. Breaking past the ceiling of <2/3nm will require entirely new quantum processing techniques.
3. Whoever can monopolize this area first, is poised to take over the current extant semiconductor hardware industry. And because the process requires a paradigm shift in approach, traditional incumbents don't have any real advantage over upstart entrants.
4. Therein lies the opportunity. A tale of market cannibalization that I think when viewed in this light provides a much clearer picture of how the semiconductor industry and computing in general, could be affected.",5,0.74,1607090961.0
t3_k8sll7,"Market mechanics and technicals (short squeezes, etc.)","I'd like some detail on short squeezes and the mechanics behind them. The questions come in the face of high valuations for a handful of companies ($600 billion market cap for Tesla, etc.) that implicitly require very high financial returns to justify.

I can't help but wonder about the market mechanics that might be creating the situation instead of just believing that everyone is armed with a DCF and calculating the true present value of securities on the market.

This leads me to a few questions, but I invite recommendations on how to learn more if outright answers are too involved. It's been a few years, but I have read books like Reminiscences of a stock operator, generally familiar with the Hunt Brothers and their silver market corner, etc.

1. How can you define a short squeeze? We know it's when the price rises and forces short sellers to cover their short. But is there a way to quantitatively describe this? What metrics would you use?

2. Is there any way to differentiate them? Would it be based on how closely the security is held? (Northern Pacific was held by 2 people and JP Morgan whereas Tesla is held by countless individuals)

3. Is there any way to estimate how long they occur for? Do they eventually turn from sellers who add liquidity, or what?

4. Do options traders influence this? Let's say folks buy call options, and it send the price of a call option higher, wouldn't that allow for firms to step in and created a synthetic call? (Buy the underlying security, buy the put, sell the call) If so, could this create a leveraged impact on underlying security ownership from the firms trying to capitalize on rising call option prices, which requires them to buy the underlying stock?",14,0.95,1607384623.0
t3_k9eos2,Possible Merger Between Tesla and Another Automaker,"This isn't so much a thesis as much as an idea. Curious to get your guy's thoughts.

And here's another article about it:
https://electrek.co/2020/12/01/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-merging-with-other-automakers-after-valuation-surge/

On the surface it seem to make a lot of sense. Tesla's market cap is at an all-time high and is now 3 times as large as the second largest automaker(Toyota) and close to 10 times as large as GM. Why not use this valuation to their advantage and greatly accelerate their manufacturing capabilities? Not only would they have physical access to more manufacturing, they'd also get a wealth of intellectual knowledge in terms of engineers and processes. Their supply chain would also see a boost from the other automakers existing agreements and relationships with vendors.

\- What does it mean for future equity risk premiums, volatility, and importantly valuation? 

\- Will we see a permanent higher revaluation of the PE ratios, for e.g high 20s for the US markets? 

\- Will we see a permanent shift in the 60/40 allocation mix with a tilt towards equities and what does that mean for equity flows and and the resulting valuation?

\- What sector implications will it lead to- Tech to be the strongest? Or will we start relying more on cash flow yields vs earnings yields to discount the influence of rates as a factor? 

The only books that I felt were somewhat closer to this topic were: 

\- Holy Grail of Macroeconomics by Richard Koo- describes how the Japanese dealt this situation with, as they are working with lower rates since mid 90s

&nbsp;


Disclaimer: I am long this company.  I generally pay up for high-quality compounders with a long runway. While this investment doesn't fit those characteristics of quality, I was driven to the compelling valuation. This is a minor (~5%) position in what is a concentrated (~6-7 company) portfolio.


&nbsp;


This thesis originated from ValueInvestorsClub author ""CT3 1HP"". Please see their writeup for a much better and more detailed, albeit slightly outdated description of the business/thesis. 


&nbsp;


**Elevator Pitch**

With the S&P 500 trading at a 37x P/E ratio I've been searching for good businesses with low expectations baked in despite modest growth. With a 50%+ ROIC, steady ~12% annual revenue/profit growth, at a ~4x EV/EBITDA multiple, Wayside Technology (WSTG) seems to fit the bill. **A slight re-rating to 5x EBITDA with 15% growth through 2023 would result in 96.5m EV, or 120m market cap (56% upside).**


&nbsp;


**The Business**

Please see this infographic for a concise overview of the company's value proposition. https://i.imgur.com/AgfGMT9.jpg

**Overview:** WSTG is a middleman between emerging software products and large established IT distributors (think CDW). Software start ups often lack the know-how, network, and managerial resources to effectively market to their target market. Established IT distributors struggle with vetting/appropriately matching an overwhelming number of software products to sell into their channels. WSTG transacts in the middle of these two parties, distributing to 4,000+ partners via 100+ vendor relationships. My first thought is skepticism around this company's value proposition, but their track record of steady growth and long-standing relationship with giants such as CDW suggest resiliency against disintermediation. I also believe the business has been so durable due to the sheer size and continued growth of the industry. 

**New Management:** Falling margins, meager profit growth, and deteriorating ROICs tainted WSTG's financial picture under the helm of prior CEO Simon Nynens. Dale Foster became WSTG's CEO in January 2020, preceding the unlocking of cash from working capital to deploy on acquisitions, as well as the beginnings of a margin inflection. In addition to the unlocking of that cash, in 2020 WSTG has made its two largest acquisitions in its history. Prior to WSTG, Foster ran a nearly identical business, growing its sales from 40m in 1997 to 550 million in 2017.


&nbsp;


**Financials**

**Cash Flow/EBITDA:** 38M LTM FCF. However, the massive spike  is due to an improved receivables arrangement with one of their vendors, so it is by no means an accurate proxy for the strength of the business. TTM EBITDA in June is 12.7m. (4.8m net income + 1.8m taxes, +.5 D&A, +.8 stock comp, +1.9 legal, +.6 acquisition cost, +2 CDF Group EBITDA).

**ROIC:** What attracted me to this business in the first place is its ROIC. Ex-cash (including cash in ROIC here makes zero sense to me), they're at barely negative working capital. With ~3m in fixed assets and ~7m in intangibles, the business earns in excess of 50% in cash on capital deployed in the business, depending on the run-rate cash flow number you arrive at. Analyzing historical cash from investing reaffirms this point - it has barely exceeded 1m in any of the last 10 years, while the business produced ample albeit lumpy cash from operations. Bottom-line, it's ultimately a cash cow requiring next to zero reinvestment.

**Cashflow Growth Story:** Analyzing revenue growth can be deceptive, as accounting changes resulted in a ~60% yoy decline in revenue in 2016. Adjusting for the accounting change, annual sales (gross billings) have steadily grown from 206m in 2010 to ~650m in current LTM, a healthy ~12% annual growth rate.

The industry grows at ~10% / year. WSTG's market share in North America has climbed from .15% in 2006 to .18% in 2019. Thus, there is the case to be made for a long runway in terms of both organic and acquisitive growth.
 
With regards to the cost structure, EBITDA margin has begun to inflect upwards over the last year, suggesting some operating leverage has yet to be realized. 


&nbsp;


**Valuation** 

At $17.76 a share the market capitalization is 77.48m. With 22.9m (40.3m-17.4m for subsequent acquisition) cash on hand and 0 debt that suggests a 54.58m enterprise value. With ~12.7m in estimated run-rate EBITDA (barring any growth), you're looking at a 4.3x EV / EBITDA multiple. What's more - due to such little re-investment requirements, I believe the company will be able to just stack cash on its balance sheet- or more opportunistically - shore up EBITDA growth with bolt-on acquisitions. On that note, the company has just announced the acquisition of CDF Group Limited for $17.4m, the largest acquisition in the company's history. CDF Group earned 2m EBITDA LTM, but was acquired due to supposed cross-selling/synergistic potential. 

Ex-acquisitions I conservatively estimate 10% EBITDA growth per year. On the more bullish end, the business plowing cash into further acquisitions and an inflection in margin offer further growth upside.  That said, I believe it is feasible the company is able to achieve 15-20% EBITDA growth through 2023. I don't forsee further multiple compression, so there is only upside there IMO. All-in-all, a slight rerating to 5x EBITDA with 15% growth through 2023 would result in 96.5m EV, or 120m market cap (56% upside) assuming they maintain current cash position. I wouldn't be surprised at an even more generous re-rating given these numbers play into fruition and the market wakes up to what is a compelling growth story.

**Risks/Concerns**

I don't like lack of insider ownership

Small microcaps are inherently risky, law of small numbers, loss of customer/contracts. CDW represents ~26% of WSTG's sales, top 5 represent approximately 55%.

Poor execution/capital allocation/acquisition strategy. My mindset here is... ""it's hard to mess this one up"". The value of the business should be able to grow at appreciable rates even with sub-par acquisitions due to the business's ability to generate cash.",4,0.71,1608147760.0

t3_kevaxu,Google - The Bear Case,"**Summary**

Ad revenue growth is slowing down and I expect this trend to continue.

That's Google’s core business, which means the company will be forced to explore other avenues to maintain growth.

Cloud, Youtube, and Waymo will provide some future growth. But will it be enough?


**Thesis**


Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL) has been an outstanding company and investment for the better part of 20 years. Its search engine is unparalleled and there is little chance of it getting displaced any time soon. Nonetheless, its main source of revenue; search engine ad spending is beginning to taper off. With stiff competition, there is an inherent risk in Google which many investors may not be factoring into their analysis. Below we develop the bear case for Google.

**Google's core Business**


There's probably not an adult human in the world that doesn't know and understand how Google makes money. It's all about the ads. When searching for anything on the internet, you are going to use google and in most cases, you will be looking at the first few results on the first page. The importance of featuring high up on a google search has turned SEO and SEM into a billion-dollar business in and of itself. But there's a much easier way to guarantee a top spot and that is paying Google, and it doesn't stop there. Google also has ads all over the web in the form of ""banners"" and the like, and because it knows what you are searching, it knows which ads to show you.

There's no doubt that Google ads are effective but is there a limit to how much Advertising we can tolerate? More importantly, is there a limit to how much businesses can spend on google ads?

There is a defined trend that is also supported by intuition and real-life evidence. First off, it is clear that the effectiveness of search ads and banner ads is decreasing. People are becoming increasingly aware of them and avoiding them, either unconsciously or actively through adblockers. On top of adblockers, businesses that use these forms of ads based on clicks or impressions also face the risk of fraud through bots and other ""hacks"". Lastly, it is obvious that the most popular forms of advertising now is coming from influencers and other types of affiliate marketing. Google Ads can only go so far, and nowadays consumers are demanding a more personalized and ""immersive"" advertising experience.

**Where's the growth?**


Google is actively pursuing other avenues to replace its falling ad revenue growth. In this section, I'd like to cover some of the most significant growth initiatives that the company is pursuing. These include Google Cloud, Youtube, and Waymo.

*Google Cloud*

It's all about the cloud these days, and Google has undoubtedly taken a piece of the pie. After Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft, Corp. (MSFT), Google is the largest cloud provider in the world. We cannot deny that Google Cloud has actually been outgrowing its competitors, managing to gain market share. But with the segment still, as far as I see, there are no qualitative advantages to Google's cloud offerings as of right now. Google Cloud cannot compete in size with AWS and Microsoft's Azure has the dominant position in terms of quality and public cloud. I am bullish on Microsoft's Azure and believe that it may become the dominant Cloud provider in the next few years. However, I cannot see Google taking much market share from Amazon or Microsoft, which means cloud revenues will also taper off. Even if cloud continued to grow at double digits it would still take a few years at the very least for it to even come close to representing a significant amount of Google's revenues. While Google is doing the right thing and will benefit from the cloud, they have too little market share and were too late in entering the market.

*Youtube*

Another holy grail of growth is that of Youtube and Youtube TV. Granted, once again, we have seen significant growth in revenues in the last year, but there are some inherent problems with Youtube as a whole. Firstly, as is already stated in the Annual Report, cost-per-clicks remain low. On top of that, the platform as a whole is facing an exodus of creators as percentages of revenue split for creators have been decreasing substantially. Of course, the platform remains a great way to gain traction as a content creator, but anyone seriously contemplating it as a business or job will have strong incentives to move viewers to their site or platform. For users as well, back in the day YouTube’s primary benefit was the fact that it was ad-free, and with ads now playing even during videos, the platform has no real edge other than its scale.

Lastly, I'd like to mention Youtube TV, which is included under ""Other"" in Google's reports together with revenues from Google Play. Just recently, Youtube decided to raise the price of Youtube TV by 30%. What Google is doing with Youtube TV is symptomatic of what is arguably happening with the whole business. Google used to offer superior and free products, and now that it has the size and trust of its clients, it is squeezing them as much as possible. Fair play to them, making money should be a priority, but there is only so much that people will allow or endure. After all, what does Youtube offer that can't already be found on cable or Netflix?

*Waymo*

Although autonomous driving still feels like it belongs in sci-fi movies, we know that behind the scenes, many companies are working tirelessly to deliver a technology that will save millions of dollars and lives. And here Google has a chance to be perhaps the first company to start commercializing autonomous vehicles. With Waymo already offering this service to a select user base, we could see a larger scale launch take place as early as 2021. But even if Waymo succeeds, it might still fall short. Michael McGrath estimates that Waymo could earn Google up to $40 billion by 2025. That's about 25% of Google's revenues today. Furthermore, he estimates that by 2030 the ARS market could grow to up to $700 billion, of which google could have anywhere from 20-30% market share. Indeed, if this is the case, investing in Google makes much more sense. But we must bear in mind Google also faces very hard competition, especially in my opinion from Tesla Inc (TSLA). Elon Musk has recently claimed to be on the verge of achieving level 5 autonomous driving. Of course, the CEO of Tesla is known for being overly optimistic about timelines, but there is a real chance here that Tesla could beat out Waymo.

**Valuation**

Over the last decade, Google has consistently achieved a >20% revenue CAGR year after year, which is what investors have come to expect. But with its main source of revenue being ads, what if Google only delivers good growth instead of amazing growth in the next 20 years? The point is that Google will have to reinvent itself to maintain growth rates high and investors happy. Don't get me wrong. I am simply trying to point out that, given Google's current business model, it will have to adapt to continue to be a top company as it is today. Waymo could be the thing that does this for Google, as an example along with its Other Bets, so this is where I will be looking. But in the meantime, don't be surprised if growth begins to dwindle.",8,0.67,1608202187.0
t3_kfdyur,A brief long thesis to a deep value idea,"Hi guys, did a brief analysis on an interesting idea (orphaned stock) that I found in the HK stock market. Would love any feedback and am open to other considerations. This was my VIC application piece. Thankss! 


If you are only interested in the main thesis and the numbers, please scroll down to the investment thesis section. 

Business Background
Lvji Technology (驴迹科技) is China's largest online tour guide provider an 86.2% market share in the online tour guide service market, a 0.4% market share of the overall tour guide service market, and a 0.02% market share of the online tourism market in terms of GMV in 2018. Lvji has created a blue ocean, the online tour guide industry, and is spearheading the disruption of the traditional tour guide market. With the entire travel industry in China grinding to a halt in H1 2020, smaller competitors do not have the balance sheet and operational flexibility to survive. This environment is beneficial for Lvji in the long term as it is able to take up greater market share and roll out new synergistic initiatives.

Lvji deploys software on Alibaba Cloud to provide online tour guides with proprietary contents. These contents include illustrated maps of tourists attractions, editorial contents, voice-over commentaries of points of interest. There is a full list of patents and copyrights associated with these contents at the bottom of Lvji's IPO prospectus. These features are aggregated and implemented to include other function such as real-time navigation. For instance, a user who is exploring the Great Wall of China will experience real-time voice-over commentaries depending on the location of the user. 

Lvji generates a substantial portion of their revenue from the sales of online tour guides through Online Travel Agencies (OTA), such as Meituan, Ctrip, Quniu, etc. The relationship between Lvji and these OTAs allows Lvji to rapidly grow its customer base with little to no marketing spend. The typical cut these OTAs are entitled to be approximately 40-50% of the price of the map. Lvji managed to enter and maintain two exclusive agreements with the two of the top 5 OTAs that they work with. The two OTAs enjoy a higher cut of 50%. It is useful to note that prices of their online tour guides sold through OTAs range from approximately RMB3.9 to RMB7.4 (USD0.6 - USD1.13). With prices that are already extremely low and creates so much value for the consumer, it is extremely undesirable and foolish for a competitor to enter the market and potentially start a price war. This also provides Lvji with the optionality to increase the price of its online tour guides as they roll out new features to enhance the experience. 

Lvji also generates an extremely small portion of the revenue from traditional agencies, where these agencies buy a fixed number of online tour guides with activation codes from Lvji at a fixed price. Lvji has its own APP that is currently not widely used, and hence, also only represent a minuscule portion of its total revenue. 

I am inclined to completely discount these two areas of the business as the success of its APP is highly dependent on the execution ability of its management team. This will naturally require a lot of marketing expense and resources that may distract Lvji from dominating the industry. Besides, I'm not sure if we can trust the 5* reviews on Lvji's APP.

Outside of the sale of online tour guide, Lvji provides services for customized content to administrators of tourist attractions and local government offices. Lvji creates proprietary online tour guide contents for tourist attractions in a form of an independent APP or mini-program commissioned by the administrators of the tourist attractions, and charge one-time service fees. These guides may include AI commentaries, automatic positioning, and other additional functions. While the revenue from content customization is still currently insignificant, it is clear that the management intends to develop this area. 

From the latest 2020 interim report, Lvji has mentioned that they are actively seeking new synergistic initiatives to create value for attraction administrators. I believe that the success or failure of any industry within China is heavily influenced by the government's policies. While this may also be the case for many countries with varying degree, the impact is extremely apparent within China. It is clear that China has set the directive to digitalize the tourism industry, with tourism being one of the key pillars of China's strategic industries. This trend has also been accelerated due to COVID. A quick relevant google search should land you a few informative articles.

Suppliers. OTAs are categorized as suppliers as their concession fees are recognized as their cost of sales from an accounting perspective. However, they are not actually Lvji's suppliers in its supply chain. OTAs provide the platform for Lvji to reach out to millions of travellers within China. To fuel Lvji's high growth for the past 2 to 3 years, Lvji resorted to outsourcing the raw content and data collection from third parties before aggregating these content as part of their own. This scalable business model reduces the need for excessive manpower for routine work. 

Industry Dynamics and Lvji's role
Lvji has commissioned Frost & Sullivan, independent market research and consultant, to report on the online tourism industry and online tour guide service industry in China. I note the obvious agency problem here and Frost & Sullivan may be inclined to be biased towards the future of the industry but I would still like to highlight a few data points and colour they provided. I will be largely ignoring their expectations of the growth rates over the next few years as I do not understand the fundamental backing behind those numbers, albeit seemingly conservative. Feel free to have a look and comment if you agree or disagree with their forecasts.

General macro tailwinds. Rising per capita disposable income and strong demand for tourism have been driving the growth of the tourism market in China, where the offline tourism market experienced a CAGR of 9.1% and online with 32.5% per annum from 2014 to 2018. I would like to point out that it may be interesting to note that while the industry as a whole is still growing very quickly, the divergence in growth rates highlights a telling underlying trend. The Chinese are transiting from an offline economy to an online one very rapidly. For the better or worse, the Chinese are typically more open to the prompting of the government - from picking up contactless payments to product preferences, and now, the tour experience. As more of the youth rapidly represent a larger proportion of tourists, unlike the older generations, they prefer greater autonomy and independence in their travelling experience. Lvji matches their needs by remotely providing in-depth attraction information that they could otherwise only enjoy under a traditional tour guide's lead. We can only imagine how much more economically feasible to go with the remote option as well. Locals at the entrance of a tourist attraction may charge up to RMB600 - RMB700 for a personally guided tour. Well, one can argue that there is value in the personal touch but is the touch worth RMB600 - RMB8 (the price of map)= RMB592? I am not too sure but some may even view the added personal touch as a reduction of value instead. 

Online Tourism Agency market. The OTA industry is neither extremely concentrated nor highly fragmented. The top five OTAs accounted for 82.0% of China's online tourism market in terms of GMV in 2018 but there are hundreds of smaller players, possible with their own niche. A few of the larger players are Meituan, Ctrip, Qunar, and Alibaba's Fliggy. The OTA industry, however, is extremely competitive. There are numerous internet giants in China that are always interested in grabbing a piece of the pie wherever they go. Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu are the giants partially behind the digital transformation of many industries, from e-commerce to ride-sharing, to food-delivery, and travel. This dynamics may explain why the OTAs are willing to rapidly adopt Lvji's products as part of their platform. If an OTA observes that one of its competitors have a new and superior feature, it is necessary to get on board quickly. 

Number of tourist attractions. There are more than 31,692 tourist attractions within China and Lvji has covered 22,044 tourist attractions, comprising of close to 100% of all A grade tourist attractions. It is curious to note that the value of their product and service becomes very apparent for lower grade tourist attractions that are typically less covered by traditional tour guides. I believe that this is likely to be an eventually winner-takes-all market where it is a lot more convenient and consistent to use a product from a large company that has wide attraction coverage for different attractions than to use different products from different providers with varying quality and features. 

Tour guide service market in China. Tour guide can be mainly divided into online tour guide, audio guide, and personal tour guide. The total revenue of the tour guide service market has increased from approximately RMB38.5B in 2014 to approximately RMB66.7B in 2018, a CAGR of approximately 14.8%. The online tour guide market contributed only 0.0007% and 0.5% of the overall tour guide service market in 2015 and 2018 respectively. I do believe that while there is still value in having a personal tour guide for some tourists, Lvji's online tour guide if implemented properly, should naturally replace the need for audio guides and a substantial proportion of personal tour guides. 

Dennis Hong of ShawSpring Partners mentioned how SEA has a subtle but extremely valuable real estate that is embedded in each of its loyal users' phone - the Shopee APP. The customer may or may not purchase anything on the first few usages of the APP, but when the user has any intention of purchase, there is a strong likelihood of turning to the APP if the user likes the user experience. While Lvji has an extremely long way to develop its own APP, existing users of their product via OTAs should recognize the incremental value Lvji brings compared to using traditional options. 

Online tour guide market. Strong government policies, increasing internet penetration rate, and the preference for self-guided and in-depth tourism experience has led to impressive growth in the online tour guide service market. The market experienced a CAGR of 942.6% from RMB0.3M in 2015 to RMB340.0M in 2018. Do note that this only represents 0.5% of the overall tour guide service market. There is no reason why this percentage shouldn't grow over time. 

Government Support. 
'According to the “13th Five-Year Tourism Development Plan” 《“十三五”旅遊業發展規劃》 issued by the State Council, China will further improve the tourism market as tourism becomes one of the pillars of China’s strategic industries. Innovation in the tourism industry is expected to provide people with high-quality and specialized choices which provide new types of tourist attractions as well as the potential market for online tour guide service. In addition, information infrastructure development is also expected to be improved and strengthened, including comprehensive coverage of free Wi-Fi, online tour guide, electronic interpreter, online booking, and push notification of tourist attractions information above category AAAA by 2020, which encourages the development of online tour guide service market nationwide in the near future.' - Lvji IPO Prospectus
Lvji has already been working with many tourist attraction and government administrators to provide the infrastructure for smart tourism. While I cannot precisely quantify or evaluate how much of a tailwind this provides, it is comforting to know that Lvji is swimming with the policy current. 

Strategic direction and capital allocation
In the latest interim report, they stated they plan to use AR and AI technologies to build a digital marketing platform centred on ticket sales of tourist destinations, and integrate the ticketing, management, marketing, and promotion of tourist destinations with the surrounding amenities (shopping, etc.). They intend to integrate other features that seem like buzzwords to me. I cannot evaluate what exactly they are doing here even though they seem to be doing quite a bit. 

They also mentioned that they are actively watching for M&A opportunities to grow/ enhance their core operations. This may have been the motivating force behind the PIPE deal that was recently passed.

On 12 October 2020, Lvji had a PIPE deal that is worth HK$47.9M issued to three strategic subscribers. 'The net proceeds are intended to be used for (1) operating expenses such as hiring additional employees and procuring advanced hardware and software equipment to increase the Group's productivity; and (2) equity acquisition and investment of high-quality enterprises associated with the Company's business. '


Management
Mr. Zang Weizhong is a 12-year China Mobile executive before he embarked on this start-up. Mr. Zang currently directly owns 399M shares, representing 28% of all shares outstanding. He has purchased 746,000 shares from the open market at 0.89.

I have read through a few transcripts of Mr. Zang's interview and it seems like he has his eyes set on the long-term. You can take a look at a few (and google translate) here:
https://news.futunn.com/stock/11154810?src=3
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1633774813058503210&wfr=spider&for=pc

'整个团队在臧总的带领下，更倾向于用“藏锋于钝，养辩于讷”的战术稳步发展；在智慧旅游行业占据更多市场份额、开拓更多营销渠道，他坚信智慧旅游游中场景是继在线旅游行业后的又一风口！游中场景的蓝海市场尚处于“社会主义初级阶段”，大量“游中新物种”尚未被发现，“藏锋于鞘”的战术是目前的最佳路径。'

Here, Mr. Zang talks about how Lvji seeks to be mediocre on the surface but brilliant in its core. Charismatic leaders like Jack Welsch tend to have the most attention and praise. They are usually in the limelight and are influential in the media. However, the book 'The Outsiders' presented findings that are contrary to the common wisdom. Capital allocators that are introverted, quiet, and brilliant seem to have a better shot at creating the most shareholder value - perhaps because they are less concerned about what the media thinks about them. 

Mr. Zang recognized that Lvji has created a blue ocean, '游中场景的蓝海市场', and is currently only at its early stage of growth. He believes that it is the best to make as little scene as possible while growing rapidly quietly. 

Risks

Micro-cap Chinese company: Corporate Governance
While there is a general understanding that larger Chinese companies that work very closely with the CCP are typically 'clean', I cannot have the same level of confidence in the smaller firms. The premise is that the Chinese government cannot afford to lose face if these large companies turn out to be fraudulent. This poses a huge reputational risk in the financial system and the CCP itself. China is still at a crucial stage of development to decouple from its '关系' roots, where 关系 is relationship in mandarin, and the line between corruption and relationship is blurred. 
I believe that few are foreign to the number of high profile frauds that come from China: Luckin Coffee, Sino Forest, Longwei Petroleum, and others that typically listed in the US via reverse mergers. A few red flags that I highlighted are:
• Several inconsistencies in the metrics reported in their IPO prospectus vs those reported in their interim and annual report. This could either mean that they are attempting to hide a slowdown or just be a lack of depth in reporting. 
• Little brand recognition in China. The reason why I completely discounted the value of its proprietary APP is due to a lack of presence in China. The reviews seem to be fake and bought.
• Odd IPO pricing. Lvji IPO'ed at HK$2.12, oversubscribed by 84.66 times. At HK$2.12, Lvji has a market capitalization of HK$3B. For a company that generated HK$642M in revenue, HK$203M in operating income, HK$190M in net profits, net cash of HK$91M in FY2019, that’s only a valuation of EV/Sales = 4.53x, EV/EBIT = 14.33x. Bear in mind that Lvji is a company that has its top line growing at 400%, 300%, and 80%, 3 years prior to its IPO. Why? 

High reliance on OTAs, lack of proprietary brand
It is clear that Lvji's business is entirely dependent on OTAs. I would argue that the more fragmented the OTAs are, the better it is for Lvji. Since Lvji will have greater bargaining power over these OTAs. However, if these OTAs suffer and, say, the industry undergoes a consolidation, the balance of power may shift and reduce the cut Lvji gets out of their products on the surviving OTAs. This is, of course, just speculation as I lack sufficient knowledge to know how the industry dynamics will pan out in the future. It is good to note that the top 2 customers, Meituan and Ctrip, represent 57.7% and 37.3% of their total revenue respectively. 

Execution Risk
From observing how Lvji allocates their capital and the update in the latest Interim Report, Mr. Zang has the intention to ramp up investments in developing their nascent content customization division. This is likely to require huge upfront investments for long term monopoly benefits over the customer's tourist attraction. Due to how new this area is, it is almost impossible to evaluate the probability of success of the venture. We are unable to tell how much competition there will be eventually if Lvji's progress proves to be promising and profitable. 

Lack of competitors for meaningful comparison 
Lvji has been very successful in dominating the online tour guide service market but this also means that there are no true competitors that we can draw a comparison to. It is unfair to compare to other companies in the travel industry, say the OTAs, given the vastly different competitive environment. We will have to make do with the information we have at hand and posit the likely outcomes. 


Investment Thesis
With downside risks considered, we explore what actually makes Lvji a compelling investment with favourable risk-reward ratios.

Promising outlook with a strong growth profile
From the above, I believe it is clear that odds are in the online tour guide market's and Lvji's favour for the industry to continue to experience strong growth post-COVID. The Total Addressable Market (TAM) is not easy to pinpoint due to the uncertainty behind the future growth of the industry. However, it is helpful to note that a 5% market share of the overall tour guide service market in 2023 would be RMB6.15B in online tour guide service market GMV, assuming an expected tour guide service market GMV of RMB123.7B in 2023. The GMV of online tour guide service market is at RMB340M in 2018. 

Cheap
The overall depressing short-term outlook of the travel industry has heavily penalized Lvji's share price unfairly. Lvji is a business that has experienced strong top-line growth of 400%, 320%, and 79.6% for the three years prior to its IPO on 16 January 2020. With an asset-light business model, it has also been able to generate positive and growing operating income with an attractive margin of approximately 30%. As a testament to its flexible asset-light model, Lvji has successfully optimized its cost structure and control its cash burn to only a -RMB14M cash outflow from operating activities. It may also be telling to note that Lvji has actually ramped up its investment activities from RMB234M for 6 months ended 30 June 2019, to RMB501M for the same period ended 30 June 2020. The investments are largely associated with its smart tourism initiatives and upgrading of its software. Lvji's has a healthy net cash balance of RMB549M as of 30 June 2020.

Lvji currently has a market capitalization of HK$1.3B, net cash of HK$651M (0.45HKD per share!), and EV of HK$649M. With 2019 revenue of HK$643M and EBIT of HK$186.3M, we have EV/Sales = 1.01x and EV/EBIT = 3.49x. This is beyond cheap even if Lvji stops growing. 

Unlikely to be a value trap
A value trap typically exists when a cheap business remains cheap for a very long time. This usually happens to melting ice cubes with ever-deteriorating business fundamentals. However, in the case of Lvji, given how fast it is expected to compound over the next 3-5 years, it is extremely unlikely for Lvji's market multiple to continue halving as its earnings double. 


Catalyst

Why does this opportunity exist and catalyst

1. COVID. A small no-name Chinese travel company with no big names backing decides to IPO in the peak of pandemic in China. It is likely that investors had no appetite to take on such a risk. With HK-listed companies only reporting twice a year, the first half of 2020 was horrendous for Lvji. Any update on performance is expected to only come in next year March. 
2. Micro-capitalization company with no analyst and media coverage. This is quite self-explanatory. This is likely to be the reason why there is little to no investor interests in the company. 
3. Strong domestic recovery. Domestic travel within China has already almost recovered to pre-COVID highs. More than 600M people travelled in China during Golden week. With the immunization program out in China and strong faith in the government, domestic consumption and tourism appetite have recovered extremely strongly. Added precautions to reduce physical contact has also benefitted travel software businesses like Lvji. Assuming Lvji still remains as the company as we know, the next interim report in March 2021 should show that Lvji is back to its growth trajectory. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/china-attractions-630-million-people-travel-during-golden-week.html

Valuation
It is more than an art than science to value a high growth company. Due to a lack of knowledge, I have no opinions regarding the long-term compounding potential of Lvji and will seriously consider exiting my position when the valuation becomes 'fair' as investors start recognizing what we have here. 
While I disagree with the widespread consensus of using EV/S to evaluate the cheapness of any high growth software business, a company with such growth profile, balance sheet, and margins listed in the US will typically command minimally a EV/S of 10.0x. An EV/EBIT of 20.0x - 30.0x seems fair for a business that is cash generative and expected to grow minimally for another 3-5 years with at least 20.0% CAGR, conservatively.
This gives us a present target price range of between HK$5 to $9. 

I believe that even after considering the risks associated with investing in an obscure COVID-hit travel stock in China, a strong alignment of management interests, strong balance sheet, and a cheap price tag offers very good risk-reward profile that warrants a high conviction position.

t3_kgajeq,Algorithmic Middle Market Direct Lending,"Investing and security analysis relies more and more on access to information and ability to process information efficiently.

From my research there seems to be two areas where’s data/information is used the most for investing and analysis: liquid publicly trades securities (referring to “quantamental” investing) and personal or small business lending.

Liquid publicly traded securities makes sense. There is standardized information in the form of SEC filings and historical pricing, which can be used to evaluate a security.

Personal / small business lending has no public information but banks or alternative lenders (Sofi, Earnest, LendingClub, etc.) have enough data so that they can evaluate credit worthiness.

I view these as two opposite corners of the investing world, large public equities vs small privet debt.

Question: Will there ever be a world where these meet in something like middle / lower middle market direct lending funds? Will direct lending funds (and possibly PE funds) use algorithms to do fundamental analysis and underwrite and invest in businesses? 

If there were large amounts of clean financial information (a big ask) which could be used for valuation models and security analysis, there could be expected performance grades similar to something like an Altman z-score. You’d obviously need more info such and the lenders lien type, covenants, etc. but if this becomes possible, I believe that DL funds could take smaller hold sizes (more positions per fund) and create CLO type funds with MM investments.

Please provide your thoughts on 1) if this could be possible 2) what would need to happen to make it possible 3) what are the biggest obstacles that would not make this possible.

Any additional thoughts on use of information/data in private market analysis can be added.",15,0.74,1608394377.0

t3_ki8z2q,(PFMT) Performant Financial: Boring Business but a Diamond in the Rough,"Disclaimer: Long time lurker, first time posting there. I plan to long in this company as I became sold on the long term position of the company's growth in the health care sector. This is a minor position (5%) in what is a concentrated (10-15 company) portfolio.

Edit: part 2, addressing other qs: https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kiyfwx/pfmt_performant_financial_boring_business_but_a/

**PFMT- Performant Financial**   
**Overview:**  
PFMT is a technology-based provider of audit, recovery, payment accuracy, coordination of benefits (COB), and outsource services in the United States.  PFMT analyze claims, identify, prevent and correct inaccurate payments. Using their proprietary analytics platform and industry expertise, PFMT aim to reduce losses on billions of dollars worth of improper healthcare payments, state/federal/and treasury tax delinquencies, defaulted student loans and other receivables.  Primary customers include government commercial health plans, CMS, Blues plans, regional Insurers, private/commercial programs, etc that operate in complex and highly regulated environments that rely on PFMT's innovative and disruptive approach. Revenue is generated based on a percentage of validated recoveries for clients. Contracts are negotiated on case by case basis, fees may range from 10-30% of recoveries and the duration of contracts may last 3-5+ years.  These are high margin, recurring revenue contracts, expected to provide multiple years of prolonged double digit growth.  
This is not a sexy business, quite boring in fact. However, a good investment should be boring. Hopefully you will also appreciate the new path management has coursed, and see the potential upside in this turnaround story.   
Historically, PFMT was known for its legacy business as a collection agency for student loans, federal/state tax delinquencies and other receivables. Since the taking over of student loan originations by the Federal government a decade ago, PFMTs student loan collections have seen a diminishing contribution to revenues over time. Currently, the student loans collection business accounts for about 22% of revenues. While ""Other"" legacy collections still account for about 26% of revenues. Growth in Other legacy collections has remained relatively flat over the years. A smaller business segment derives marginal revenues from first party call centers and licensing of hosted technology solutions to clients.  ***The diamond in the rough refers to PFMT's up-and-coming*** ***healthcare*** ***business segment***, composed of claims auditing and eligibility reviews. After seeing losses in 2018/19 due to high ramp up costs and standard implementation time lags, this segment appears to be set for robust growth going forward.  Management has been clear that from 2017-2019, adjusted EBITDA has witnessed a slowdown to reflect a period of transformation in the company to establish itself in the Healthcare space. Management has confidently reiterated their belief in successfully reaching a 2021 goal of achieving $200M revenue with 20% EBITDA margins, with double digit growth continuing for years to come.  


**Covid-19 Impact:**  
This year was shaping up to be a strong year for PFMT, as Q1 showed promising results that validated the new trajectory of the company. Unfortunately, Q2 and Q3 were impacted by the public health emergency related to Covid-19. The CARES act brought changes that affected the student loans collection segment. Student loan payments, interest accrual and involuntary collection of payments (wage garnishments) were originally suspended till September 30, 2020 but were extended till December 31, 2020. However, PFMT continued to generate student loan revenue for a number of months from existing in-process borrow rehabilitation agreements. Another impact of Covid came from existing healthcare audit customers that requested a short-term pause on PFMT activities. Mgmt has indicated these pauses have largely ended during the third quarter. To mitigate the impact of this temporary slowdown, mgmt had furloughed more than 500 employees which could result in savings of about $18 million. The company is now aggressively ramping up efforts (including hiring/recruiting). Mgmt anticipates the ramp up efforts to be properly reflected in revenue by Q1 of 2021.  
   
**Healthcare Business:**  
The healthcare platform has finally reached scale, accounting for the largest (and continually growing) contribution to PFMTs revenue. In Q3, the healthcare business generated $17.6M in revenue  (48.5% of total revenues (refer to Figure 1 below to view a cut out from the latest 10-k)). That is a 20.5% increase on sequential basis and a 63% increase from the same period last year. Please refer to figure 2 below, to see the change in healthcare revenues over time. This segment will continue to grow as Mgmt has made it clear this will be a main focus for the company. Soon healthcare will be the primary source of revenue (50%++), leading to a market multiple re-rate.  
Healthcare revenues over last 11 quarters:

Q3 2020= $17.6M  
Q2 2020= $14.6M  
Q1 2020= $17.5M  
Q4 2019=$14.3M  
Q3 2019= $10.8M  
Q2 2019= $9.3M  
Q1 2019= $9M  
Q4 2018= $9.9M  
Q3 2018= $6.6M  
Q2 2018= $6.1M  
Q1 2018= $3.5M

\[Figure 2: PFMT Healthcare Revenues\]([https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu](https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu))

**Macro:**  
The macro environment indicates there should be tailwinds for the audit, recovery, payment accuracy and coordination of benefits outsourcing business solutions PFMT provides. According to the CMS, national healthcare expenditures are forecast to grow at 5.4% CAGR for the next 8 years. Reaching  $6.8T by 2028. Despite efforts to reduce the amount of improper payments, error rates in the industry range from 6% in commercial to 14.9% in government plans. Healthcare spending growth is driven primarily by a combination of increasing enrollment and cost inflation. Given the current unemployment environment, we are witnessing a spike in Medicaid enrollment, which should continue to benefit the business via rising utilization and claims volumes. It is useful to note that there can be a lag of several months between Medicaid eligibility and resulting claims volumes. This indicates that a majority of the benefits from the current environment are still to come. Also, as private organizations and state governments are struggling with lower revenues and budget deficits, this could create an increased focus on cost containment strategies where PFMT could play a supporting function. PFMT mgmt sees a $200B+ healthcare TAM growing annually.  
**Competitors:**  
PFMT differentiates itself with its proprietary technology and customizable approach to each of their customers' needs. The space is mostly dominated by large, slow moving players, that lack flexibility and uniqueness in their approach.  Major competitors include HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY-US, \~\~$3B mkt cap) and Cotiviti (acquired in mid-2018 for $4.9B). Contracts in this industry are limited, take time to implement and can last years. PFMT continues to build a moat around it's business by consistently winning, maintaining and being awarded new contracts. An example includes being re-awarded CMS recovery Audit Region 1 and being awarded the newly created Region 5. Thus, successfully showcasing PFMTs superior product and path to success in this space. PFMTs will continue to encroach on incumbents' healthcare market share as the market begins to realize the superiority of their technology and approach.  Refer to Figure 3, below, for an image taken form the CMS website showing the audit region relative to competition. Figure 4 may help to visualize the healthcare insurance payment cycle, and where PFMT may offer value.  
**Debt:**  
On Aug 2017, PFMT entered a credit agreement with an existing shareholder and customer, ECMC. As of September 30, 2020 PFMT has about $62M loan outstanding under this credit agreement.  ECMC has been able to accumulate about 5.8M warrants in PFMT as part of the agreement (about 10% of outstanding shares) all at an average exercise price of $1.95.  The effective interest rate was about 13.9% in the 1H 2020. The loan is classified as a current liability, with maturity in August 2021. However, PFMT has two one-year options to extend maturity.  
PFMT currently (as of Sept 30,2020) has about $17.3M cash and equivalents on hand and is entering a period of FCF generation.  
The current low interest rate environment offers low hanging fruit for companies looking to refinance their loans at a lower rate. Reducing their loan rate to 5-8% could save up to $5.5M in annual interest expense.  
**Timing/Technicals:**  
As the calendar approached their earnings announcement date (Nov 11), PFMT stock was trading around recent highs of $2. The stock started selling off aggressively into the earnings and significantly further following earnings (despite a very positive release). The selling pressure appears to have been caused by portfolio management layoffs at Invesco, a top holder. Public disclosure of these layoffs coincides with timing of initial selloff, and a recent 13G filing confirms the exited position. This should quell any fears holders and followers of this stock may have had, as the selling was not based on fundamental flaws in the company or a new short thesis. Invesco owned about 18% of PFMT. Following the recent pressure, it appears the stock is in extremely oversold territory. Since their exit, the average volume profile of the stock has improved significantly, making accumulating a position easier for both retail and institutional demand.  
**Valuation:**  
The timing of Covid partially contributes to why the market overlooked this stock, as Q2 and Q3 earnings were impacted. To establish a fair EBITDA estimation for 2020, we will use Q1 results with a conservative bias. Q1 is most appropriate because it will give us the clearest picture of how the company was performing prior to the temporary impacts of Covid. Using Q1, EBITDA was $6.4M (after deducting stock compensation).   Annualizing that amount will give us an EBITDA run rate of $25.6M. This is a conservative measure because we do not account for the impact of any potential interest rate savings or growth in the healthcare segment. Next we need to establish the enterprise value (EV= debt + mkt cap - cash). Which we use to calculate EV/EBITDA.  Calculation below.   
EBITDA= $25.6M  
Enterprise Value (EV)= $62M (debt) + $41 (mkt cap) -$17.3M (Cash) =  $85.7 M  
EV/EBITDA= 3.3X  
Fully diluted share count of 59.7M o/s

Now lets take a look at some Healthcare IT comparables. The first 7 are general comps, the bottom 3 are the most similar comps to PFMT. To clarify, HMSY is currently publicly trading and is a direct competitor to PFMT. In December 2019, HMSY acquired Accent (a coordination of benefits/payments accuracy unit of Intrado focused on commercial and Medicare Advantage payers) for $155M. Accent had generated about $50M of revenue during the 12 months ending october 2019 (vs PFMTs $150M revenues in 2019). Based on the transaction price, HMSY paid an estimated 11-12X EV/Ebitda on a TTM basis.  COTV was acquired and taken private in 2018, it continues to be a direct competitor with PFMT. COTV operated in payment integrity and was acquired for $4.9B in mid 2018, an estimated EV/EBITDA multiple of 14-15X based on consensus 2019 estimates.  Also, keep in mind that the average EV/EBITDA for S&P companies in 2020 is about 14.5X.

\[Table 2\]([https://imgur.com/a/MP4yZgi](https://imgur.com/a/MP4yZgi))

The market still largely views PFMT as a declining student loans collections firm. Yet growing beneath the surface is an attractive healthcare business. As this segment continues to grow the market will recognize the high quality recurring revenue, ability to scale, and increasingly healthcare-focused pure-play as a catalyst for a multiple rerate.  Now using the comps above, I will provide 3 scenarios (best, base, worst case scenario) applying a discount to conservatively account for the micro-cap nature and higher leverage of PFMT.     
In the best case scenario, we apply a 14X EV/EBTDA ratio (rounded down from the most similar comparable peer average of 14.3X) which, on a fully diluted share basis, lead to a current price per share of $6.   
In the base case scenario, we take a couple of notches off the closest peer average and apply a 12X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a current target price of $5.15/share  
In the worst case scenario, we further take off two more notches from the most similar peer average to apply a 10X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a price of $4.29/share.  
Also, considering the existing ownership of the company. Parthenon investors, Prescott Group, Mill Road Capital are all large shareholders. It is not unreasonable to think that they pursue a more aggressive activist role in the company and set it up for sale at a premium. It is also possible that competitors recognize the massive discount of this up-and-coming threat, and decide to acquire PFMT before other market participants drive up the price making such a strategic acquisition far more expensive. All of which offer upside to existing shareholders.  
As we approach future quarters and results continue to support this positive narrative we should start to see investor appetite pick up for this name. Average daily volumes have quadrupled since Invesco's recent exiting has added to the freely trading shares, improving the liquidity profile of PFMT.  These signals will start appearing on investor screens as they (professional small cap investors, value investors, quant investors, generalists, hedge funds, etc) look for new ideas. There is virtually zero sell-side coverage of this stock at the moment, this will likely change in the future. **Accumulating a position now, presents an opportunity for entry at basement level prices in a stock that has the potential to provide 500-700% upside.**

t3_kjjgmu,Looking at LIDAR (LAZR & VLDR),"I think there are substantial tailwinds for LIDAR technology given the macro shift towards EV adoption.   Because of this belief, I've been following LAZR relatively closely and have been researching some of its peers. I think the market is grossly overestimating LAZR's short-term prospects at profitability. I did a quick back-of-the-envelope multiples comparison of LAZR and VLDR (Velodyne), and I used the two companies' expected revenues for 2020. These are just forecasts so this analysis is far from complete/comprehensive, but VLDR's Price/Expected Revenue ratio is 42x. If my math is right, LAZR's is an *astonishing* **473x**. Both of these multiples are rather high for companies who have yet to turn a profit, but VLDR is much closer to actually doing so based on management's guidance in their most recent investor presentation.

I'm interested in knowing what other investors are thinking about these companies and LIDAR & EVs in general. I plan on purchasing VLDR sometime soon but it's slid pretty substantially today so I'm holding out for an even cheaper price as volumes continue to decrease at year end.

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**

The 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company’s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).

t3_kjtge5,"Just soliciting some mature thoughts on Crypto, particularly bitcoin","Folks, I've gone long cyrpto recently just to profit off the bull run but long-term I count myself in the skeptic camp. This is particularly with regards to bitcoin, and I'm more than happy to be corrected and convinced otherwise. 

This is my bear case: Bitcoin doesn't really have any real use-case unless you're trying to launder money or hide your source of funds. Sure you some niche vendors accepting it as a mode of payment but the price volatility is too much for mass adoption. What's more Central Bank digital currencies may  not be too far off (China is testing digital Yuan as we speak and many others have pilot programs) . Once CBDCs roll out (maybe 5 years?) why would you even need a bitcoin? Ethereum and all I get  totally

Now I get there has been institutional interest recently - even musk suggested he may buy it to strengthen tesla's balance sheet - but I have suspect it's just them going off script capitalizing on the euphoria and not going about this the traditional way of doing fundamental analysis and sticking to their guns. 

Pretty sure I might be missing something here...happy to get your thoughts....",27,0.81,1608872443.0
t3_kl5v9d,Is Oculus sufficient for Facebook to build a hardware moat between itself and competition from other social media companies?,"Facebook's hardware division produces Portal (video teleconferencing), Oculus Quest (Virtual Reality), and is working toward Augmented Reality glasses. A precursor to Augmented Reality glasses is coming in 2021 through a partnership with Luxottica (they make Oakley and Ray ban). Each Oculus Quest 2 sold requires an active Facebook account to use the device, and if you delete your Facebook you lose your purchases. The Oculus Quest 2 has been reported to have a production run of 3 million units per year, and it has been backordered by a month since preorders began.

In the consumer hardware space, 3 million units per year isn't huge, but this is somewhere between 50%-100% growth on last years numbers, so it's growing fast. It isn't enough to make Facebook a major hardware producer,  but is it enough to put a moat between itself and other social media companies? The major bear case seems to be that social media moves fast and the thing that replaces Facebook could be right around the corner, but how can a social media company replace Facebook if a significant portion of Facebook's userbase eventually needs to maintain an account to operate very endeared hardware?

This is assuming people will be willing to purchase Facebook's hardware. After watching years of Facebook dominating the consumer VR space by pricing superior products at subsidized prices, I'm convinced they can have success even in the face of a vocal adversarial minority.

Edit to add: Breaking into consumer hardware has been difficult and expensive for Facebook, I doubt any other social media company even has the cash, and time to attempt such an endeavor ",17,0.8,1609084493.0

t3_klz44z,Sovereign credit ratings,"Does anyone here follow sovereign credits and can provide me some basic information?

The main questions are:

1. If a country has issued debt in its own currency, it means can also print that currency and repay it. What exactly does a bond rating mean for the issuer in this case?

2. If it's not evident from the answer to #1, what causes credit ratings to change? When they downgrade a country's debt, like the US had some years ago, Canada in the early 90s, etc., what are they looking at?

3. Why did Russia default on debt that was issued in rubles? Was it harder for them to manage the exchange rate if they issued more, which would presumably lower the value of their currency, and hurt consumer imports?",10,0.92,1609189854.0
t3_kly5dl,Buffett's 1999 Fortune Article,"[https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune\_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm)

I think this article is worth reading every year or so. This is one of four? of Buffett's famous op-eds related to market levels. They've all somehow been very prescient in a short timeframe. I highlighted a few quotes I thought was interesting below. One of the more notable facts I gathered was that interest rates were 6% back in 1999! People were choosing to buy equities at crazy valuations rather than getting 6% risk free. 

&#x200B;

*DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE Dec. 31, 1964: 874.12 Dec. 31, 1981: 875.00* 

*If government interest rates, now at a level of about 6%, were to fall to 3%, that factor alone would come close to doubling the value of common stocks.* 

*If I had to pick the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined, that investors in aggregate--repeat, aggregate--would earn in a world of constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful frictional costs, it would be 6%. If you strip out the inflation component from this nominal return (which you would need to do however inflation fluctuates), that's 4% in real terms. And if 4% is wrong, I believe that the percentage is just as likely to be less as more.* 

(The actual 17 yr return from Nov 99 was 4.6% with divs reinvested)",151,0.98,1609186901.0
t3_ko0uhk,Mean Reversion and Intrinsic Value,"Hi guys, I’m sure as many of you know from reading Ben Graham’s material that he mentions in Security Analysis that value investing is based on two principals in particular that: 

1. The market is inefficient and irrational which means that there tends to be discrepancies between price and value 

2. That over time these discrepancies will correct themselves and that prices will revert back to their true value or as also Graham says “In the short run the market is a voting machine and in the long run it’s a weighing machine”

When asked about the tendency for market price to catch up with Value in 1955 Graham responded that “it is one of the mysteries of our business and it is a mystery to me as well as to everyone else”

Now these principles have been echoed by many value investors today such as Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman and Joel Greenblatt for example who teaches a class at Columbia university and said he promises his students that if they do good analysis the market will agree with their valuation

However after coming across multiple studies that have been done on the subject with companies in various industries across multiple markets that state that mean reversion is false and that what Graham has said is no longer correct I’m curious to get your guys opinion on it and would be interested if any of you have tested it with a large sample yourselves?",37,0.87,1609458554.0
t3_kntctw,When will the current euphoria burst the bubble?,"After the fed pumps of the market, the SPY is significantly higher than prior to the pandemic. Even with concerning economic status of the country (to put it mildly), many stocks are exponentially increasing in value. Perfect example is Tesla, which just crossed $700 and moving rapidly to the upside. The P/E ratio for Tesla is around 1300x compared to Spy’s 34x. I get that the hype around EV has been unprecedented and rising, but I’m concerned about the inevitable “burst” of the bubble. It’s been hinted at by many analysts these past few months. My guess is that Tesla will be the first to go down, and following it would be the EV market. There is also the factor of dollar devaluation that has been generally ignored by the general public. I would like to know what theories you all have regarding the bubble and when you predict it’s burst to be. Happy Holidays!",11,0.66,1609433237.0
t3_knqlw3,Interest rate adjusted Buffett Indicator,"Buffett indicator is calculated in the following way: Total GDP/Total stock market cap. It has famously been described by Warren Buffett as the single best way to measure whether the stock markets are overvalued. 

If we only look at this measure then it clearly shows that the stock market is over 2 standard deviations above the historical average, therefore is overvalued. However, this indicator does not take into account the interest rate and the amount of money in circulation.

To account for this, my idea is to calculate the Buffett indicator as described above and multiply it with the historical interest rates and divide it with the historical levels of money supply in each period. This would result in an index that shows whether equities are over- or under the historical average after adjusting for interest rates and the amount of money in the economy. For example, if interest rates rise, then the index will rise too, if there is a stimulus then the index will fall.

Critique my idea please.",90,0.96,1609423755.0
