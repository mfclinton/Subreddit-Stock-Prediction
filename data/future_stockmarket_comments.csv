Look at PCLN. Its 1237 now, but 2 years ago it was 714. That's a 73% gain if you owned the stock. If you thought it was going up strongly, you could have bought 1 contract for the Jan 14 1000 call for 44.55 (or $4455 total). it would have been worth $13349 at expiration. Thats a 200% gain. But the risk is much different. If you owned the stock and it didn't rise 30% to 1000, you'd still own the stock and maybe a smaller profit. With the options, you would have a full loss.

Options are not a waste of time. The problem is they are very simple and very complicated at the same time. I think most people that buy options loose overall. If you are good at picking where a stock is going to go (or not go), then options offer you leverage and different ways to capitalize on that move.

I'm not knocking this guy at all. Take the course, learn about it, but start small and slow. Its easier to loose money. My personal experience with buying calls is most don't pan out.

t3_234vle,cgtkg6a,"So... the way you've got it phrased is a little confusing.  Let me rephrase it and see if I've got this understood:

Yesterday, you bought 5 May 7-Strike Puts on PLUG @ ~2.20, at the exact time that PLUG was trading at $7.60 a share.  Today, you sold those 5 contracts when PLUG was trading at $6.90.  

Alright, my math is a little bit of an estimate, but let's break this down:

The current Delta of the May 7-Strikes on PLUG is -0.42.  Let's assume that that was about the same throughout all of yesterday.  This means that your leverage was roughly: 7.60 / 2.20 * 0.42 = 1.45.  Always compute your leverage before going in.  A leverage of 1.45 means that for every 1% drop in PLUG, your contracts gained roughly 1.45% in value.  So in other words, you weren't really leveraged all that much.  So, assuming you bought for ~2.20 a contract (because (1114 - 12)/5), your contracts would have risen about 14.7% in value based on the leverage and price change of PLUG.  A 14.7% rise would mean that the premium of those puts would have been about 2.52.  However, you held overnight, so there's a time decay.  Currently, the theta on those contracts is 0.02, so if you held overnight, you'd lose 0.02 of the premium on each contract, bringing you down roughly to 2.50 for the premium.  Now, since the bid-ask spread was 10 cents, you pay a nice big 0.10 penalty overall, bringing you to 2.40.  

You should have made ~8-9% ($90-$100) profit when all was said and done.  I am not accounting for IV-loss (vega and implied volatility change), so I'm not sure how much that ate into it.  Also, if you held from the very beginning of the day yesterday until very late into the day today, that time decay would have hit you for more than 0.02... closer to 0.03.  IV loss probably accounted for the rest of your loss.

If you want to avoid the hassle of situations like this where you get nickled and dimed by all of the options parameters, you should probably choose a much larger leverage and hold for the smallest amount of time possible (two days is okay, but the leverage was negligible, so your contract prices eroded away a bunch of your profits).  The other alternative is to hold until expiration, where the math becomes extremely simple.  ",7,1397614087,"[['PLUG', 4], ['VEGA.CN', 1]]",PLUG,6.829999923706055,6.630000114440918

That's it for now. I do do some fundamental analysis for my longer term trades but I won't get into that as it's more technique and knowing what to look for vs finding the right resources. If anyone would like to know more or has any other questions about anything related to the market drop me a PM and maybe I can help. I just ask that you include a little about yourself so I know what your current experience level is and what your goals are as a trader. Then we can chat about how to meet them! Hopefully this post helps people. I make no claims to any stocks or trading ideas w/ this, just wanted to post a huge list of all the things I use regularly that help me as a day/swing trader. Feel free to post your own resources in the comments section and if it becomes big enough and useful enough maybe we can sticky it to the sidebar or something! 

Have fun and good luck in your trading!

For me, I like some reassurance that the company won't disappear in the time frame that I want to invest, which is typically very far in the future.

We all know Elon Musk is tremendous businessman having an almost religious conviction in his product, but let's look at the market; his competition. We have several car manufacturers out there now, they are very well established with deep pockets and even deeper R&D capabilities. So what happens if/when they release the electric cars that will directly compete against Tesla?

Right now, Tesla is still stuck in that stuffy luxury car niche; competing against Mercedes, Audi, BMW. In this short amount of time, the Tesla brand has become more and more popular, but their production is still lagging anything to be considered a legitimate threat to luxury auto makers. Their results from last quarter also fell short from reaching what analysts thought they would be on track to produce. This has a lot of people hesitant.

Tesla stock has priced in some extreme growth for the company; growth that has yet to materialize except in market valuation. In the end, what really determines the movement of this stock beyond its fifteen minutes of fame is how many cars they can roll off their production line, and how quickly they can add extra digits to their earnings report to expand production capability.

However, the longer the auto industry takes to step up and provide a direct competitor to Tesla, the more Tesla manages to survive and the more likely that a midrange car is released, which could signal the tipping point that investment firms will finally step up and say it's time to expand production. 

Right now oil has dropped to crazy low prices, so it makes fresh investing money even more rare for Tesla. What I would be watching for is how Tesla, the business entity, responds to this monstrous lull in oil prices which might last a month or a decade. How does the Tesla brand, an exclusive producer of electric vehicles, survive when the alternative just became much cheaper and sexier to investors. 

If the production numbers don't lie, and it stays on a pretty decent run despite the tsunami it is fighting against, then you are looking at a true anomaly in the market. A diamond in the rough with ridiculous brand advantage. 

But if it doesn't work out that way, you just lost a lot of money waiting for the world to think like you, and you didn't even cushion yourself by buying the company when it was trading close to its book value. There is an intimidating gap between the reproducible worth of Tesla's physical assets and how much the market is valuing it at. The only thing that can sustain that gap is a verifiable crazy brand franchise value, which has yet to materialize for me.

Most of the time options expire worthless. For myself I don't tend to hold options very long because of the time decay (they lose value as they near expiration).

t3_2x2iui,cowowla,"  In my view, investing right now would be heavily speculative due to the fact that in theory, the stock would decline further.  Below is a sample for a report that I did with regards to Tesla, feel free to critique if needed: 

Because Tesla Motors has released their patents to the public, Tesla has now given the opportunity for other organizations to create their own Tesla-like vehicles.  This potential oversaturation – not seen in the automobile market since the early-20th century – will become possible will the development of new technologies. Tesla believes that the “true competition” lies not in other companies that create electric cars, but gasoline organizations that include Chrysler, Ford, and GM.  Tesla sees the releasing of their patents as the beginning of independent companies producing electric cars.  This is not only an erroneous statement, but, it is a dangerous one for the investor.  Big automotive companies have been unable to produce a successful electric car due to the initial patents that Tesla put up.  Now that the patents have ceased, companies with big bankroll, including America’s Big Three automobiles, would be able produce similar products at a competitive rate. Historically, the development of electric technology has been either suppressed, or used and sold at a higher volume from large automotive companies.  One example of such suppression involves the Great American Streetcar Scandal. During the 1940’s, led by GM, street car systems throughout America were bought, replaced by General Motor busses and roads that would be congested by GM vehicles.  Because of the money and influence that GM possessed during that era, GM was able to destroy the streetcar business without major reprieve, leading to profit for investors in GM.  

Eventually, the allure of electric cars – having once been prevented from entering the market by higher automotive companies – will be too much to bear for Chrysler, Ford, and GM.  Already, Ford has released the 2014 Ford Focus Electric, an automobile with 104.5 miles-per-gallon on electricity, with an MSRP of $35,170.  Hybrid cars, ones that possess more than two-forms of input, are becoming popular with the Toyota Prius.  It is possible that with the advent of open patents, the three big automotive companies will compete against each other for the electric car market.   In a worst-case scenario for Tesla, the opening of patents, followed by the response from big automotive companies, will actually prevent, not encourage, investors to invest into electric car ventures, thus allowing the Big Three to persevere and monopolize the electric car market.  At that point, a speculator who bought Tesla at $240 per share will not be happy in the worst-case scenario. 
	
Like other enterprising companies, the development of Tesla Motors has required capital investment. Unfortunately, this has not translated into profit for an investor.  In the periods ending in December 31 of the years 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively, Tesla lost a combined $725 million in net income; yet, despite years of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, Tesla has one of the highest share prices on the Nasdaq stock exchange.    Looking at the NCAVPS, Tesla’s stock is overpriced.  For the period ending in December 31, 2013, taking current assets ($1.27 billion) minus total liabilities ($1.75 billion) in order to find a total of -$480 million, that total is divided by shares outstanding (124.63 million) to show Tesla’s NCAVPS at -3.85 .  Flipping the negative number into a positive one, at $259.28 per share, based on the closing price of October 8, 2014, Tesla, according to the theories and principals escribed by Benjamin Graham, is over-valued sixty-sevenfold.  Realistically, the price of Tesla Motors would be profitable to the speculator in the long-term at $2.58 per share.

The recent downturn seems to be coming from the mood that the software market, which is the cornerstone of MSFT, is in a general downtrend. That mood is being reinforced by missed sales and cutting back on expected earnings (Intel is also getting hit by this). Whether or not we are experiencing the start of a trend or a simple blip for MSFT has obviously yet to be told, but my money would be on it being a blip and here is why.

1) MSFT has been aggressively expanding its cloud based services which has already payed off well for them and should continue to do so.

2) I see an ""unexpected"" upturn in the software sales for Windows 10. The funny thing about Windows OS' is that their success, or lack thereof, tends to follow a pattern of success followed by failure followed by success. Windows 8 was a resounding failure which would put Windows 10 into the success category of that pattern.

3) Hololens. I truly believe Augmented Reality is going to be the next big thing akin to the smartphone and it will start being painfully apparent sometime in 2016. I unfortunately do not have much basis for it other than it simply makes sense to me.

When to buy in: MSFT is actually about to hit its price floor of 40 extremely soon. It had hit this point last month but failed to break through. I still have a lot to learn about TA but I do not ever see the stock dropping below 38 with the likely floor of 40 holding firm. I am personally waiting to see the stock bounce off of 40 for this second time to buy into it.

t3_3191cy,cq13nu8,"There are two popular methods to look at the markets, one technical & the other fundamental... I'm not against any one method but I'm a technical analyst by choice & success. So here's my view.
First of all, good that you're looking at Microsoft, as it is a highly liquid stock, with a long trading history. This will help in your learning process, but you'll have to pick other similar stocks to diversify your learning experience.

 - There is no reason for a trend. Except for the technical (IMHO). But the why is not really important to make money in the markets, but ""when"" is critical. I don't believe the company's profits translate into anything. Proof exists in history from Enron to Lehman Brothers, some stock that went down looked even better than these both. Hence no one decided this, it's simply technical in nature.

 - MSFT simply indicated a technical bottom in 2013, after a long base from the bottom of 2009. The extended base just goes to show that even after a long time of selling, the stock could not be pushed down, hence indicating good demand for the stock. After the beginning of the rally in April 2013, MSFT entered what I call a euphoria phase in Dec 2013. Th euphoria/bubble/topping, what ever you want to call it, is simply the natural state of any security (read people buying the security) to want to rest or sell after a good period or continue with the good phase (buying). As you can see form the data, the decision was to continue. As per my experience, these phases can go on for a while but are dangerous to enter into at that time, if one hasn't entered the stock from around the bottom (around April 2013 in MSFT). But these zones are extremely profitable & a skilled trader/investor can profit massively from these.

 - What happened on 26th of Jan? The stock simply broke an important support prices of 44.3 & 42.79, not to mention with a large gap! The reason the stock is staying down is also in the follow up stock price action. The price action remained below 44.3 & failed to move above this, signalling strong selling, just like in a base, this is just the opposite of a topping roof. Hence the stock keeps loosing ground. The next support is at 40.29 just below the recent close. Simply put buyers simply thought that they had held the stock long enough & the profit should be booked on this particular stock.

 - Not to say that a stock does not break a base or a roof, nothing is written in stone in the markets, but that would require a very large strong move & with the right system you would be indicated a buy at the break of an important resistance. BTW the important resistance at this point is 46.55. If the stock breaks through 44.3 & 46.55 & stays above both these price points, then it would be a stock to buy into, else... not really. The next supports to look at would be 37.8 & 31.6. Every buy or sell has it's own risks & rewards on offer... but there is no buy on MSFT as of now (IMHO). Analyzing this would require you to build a system that looks into the cash market stocks & provides you with entry, exit points, stop loss prices, contingency prices & plans & definitely a projection into the immediate future.

Just in-case that sounded like something anyone can claim to know after the charts have shown it all, do have a look at my Crude Oil post from Oct 2013 http://www.marketlok.com/opinion-by-ravi-chandra/crude-oil-nymex-at-important-support-looking-bearish.
MSFT is looking something like Crude did in Oct 2013, but that said it does not mean that it's where it is headed, it simply means that it has formed a roof...maybe a temporary one or maybe something stronger. Only time & the stock price performance around supports & resistances will tell us the entire story.

t3_34bgaz,cqtcn77,"Haha this is cool. Actually, I appreciate the thought but to be honest this is not gonna be representative of my returns at all for a couple key reasons: 

* These lists are JUST ideas. This kinda tracking assumes that I am buying at the exact open and selling at the exact close which is not at all how I trade. 90% of these stocks will not materialize into anything worthwhile ... the key is to know day by day which ones out of the list (usually one or two) will actually be worth trading. For example the only one I actually took off my list was NES, which I bought at $4.00 and sold at $4.15. I also sold NYMX flat which was a buy from yesterday. I missed ALSK but it cracked like 15% intraday which means if I had actually caught it I probably would have made 10-12% on it and this analysis would only show 3.83%. Lastly I didn't even touch SVU, WUBA, LODE, MCHX, RMBS, or IPCI. So you can see this isn't really representative of what I did at all.

* There will also be other stocks that are not on the list that show up mid day and sometimes make huge gains unexpectedly (and possibly losses). For example I took a nice entry on CNTF at $1.14 today which wasn't even on my list today and am holding it overnight, and took a small loss on GBSN which wasn't on my list.

* Lastly stocks I buy/hold for multiple days you would have to actually add up the gains/losses each day in order to figure it out. Swing trades are often much bigger than my day trades and make up a good chunk of my monthly gains. 

Anyway, it's a cool idea, but just take it with a grain of salt I guess. What would be really funny is if somehow this proved that if I just bought everything on my list in the morning and sold it at the end of the day I could still be profitable. I highly doubt that's the case but if you track this for 6 months and it proves that to be the case I will happily wake up every day, buy a bunch of shit and then go back to bed lol

t3_3hdhne,cu6uqg3,"There's a couple of ways I think this played out.

HYH was a tax-free spin off, and shareholders of KMB received shares in the new company at 1:8.  So you could have received 1 share of HYH for 8 of your KMB.  That would account for the $850ish loss.  

KMB was also using a cash payout to buy back outstanding shares, so if you don't have a current open position in KMB then you may have received cash as part of the process.  You should check your account records for any credits.

OTOH, if you currently hold 1 HYH and 10 KMB, the spin off was basically the stock-equivalent of a one-time dividend (except shareholders don't pay taxes unless they close the positions), and you shouldn't show a loss at all (or much of one, depending on what current trading levels are).

t3_3nlqiv,cvpntem,"TLDR: This is a value play. I bought VLKAF @ $119.37 / share with a target price of between $143.32 and $182.49 by the end of FY16'. 

My process began where you did: I think that the investment community is shocked and horrified that a company as large as Volkswagen could knowingly lie to it's investors for so long (go back and read some of the annual reports, specifically the sections on emissions, they're pretty damning in hindsight).

However, pissing off Mutual Fund managers and hedge fund types who collectively feel they control the world, and not being able to make and sell passenger vehicles are two different things. VW still makes great cars. Moreover, I frankly just don't think that very many consumers give a shit about what levels of emissions their cars put out, as long as they're safe, fun to drive, and get good fuel economy. 

I think the place that this crisis will affect VW is in it's future expected revenue, and on it's balance sheet. I don't think this will affect profit margins, once you strip the incoming hits to the balance sheet out of the numbers.

Starting with the balance sheet, pick a big number that may account for the fines, and the lawsuits. They've set aside something like $8Bil right now. I don't see the EPA fining VW into oblivion because even though they blatantly lied and cheated, this snafu didn't have the same environmental apocalypse-type effect that the BP spill did, for example. Here's my opinion on this: as long as VW's balance sheet can handle this kind of an event (it can), than this short-term hit to it's cash isn't actually that important to it's ability to turn out revenues year after year.

As for their revenues, I did some math (I assumed that VW doesn't sell another diesel car in the US until 2017, that they sell 12-25% fewer passenger vehicles in North America as a result of their brand taking a beating, and that they sell 5-10% fewer passenger vehicles worldwide as well). I expect them to lose between $12Bil and $24Bil in 2016 because of this mess. I had their expected 2016 revenues at $215Bil, so that puts my estimation for 2016 revenue at  between $194Bil and $206Bil, roughly.

I used a crude way of turning those revenue numbers into projected value, I used Price to Sales ratio. Average PS Ratio for VW has been .42, it's PS ratio the week before this news broke was .35. Right now it's at .23, a reflection of the vitriol that large investors have for VW right now. I expect that ratio to recover over time as this news slips into the past and more Quarterly announcements come and go. 

I took my long position at the end of last week, but I do expect the price to go down quite a bit more before it goes back up. I'm prepared to DCA my position up until midway through 2016.",11,1444098292,"[['BP', 1]]",BP,33.7599983215332,35.15999984741211

If you took the value of every one of those cars from the years in question, and doubled the value of those sales (50% in fines, 50% in consumer lawsuits) you would probably get close to the immediate effect on market cap.

But you're not done there. You need to look at forward revenue for that line of vehicles and subtract it from future revenue.

And that's not it either, you need to take the R&D for redeveloping the engine to meet specifications, and add it to future costs. 

If you did all of those things, you would probably be at an appropriate valuation. Compare it to market cap and see if you still like the P/E.

t3_3ogk1q,cvx75e8,"Disclaimer: I'm not an expert but I can offer a few thoughts. Perhaps someone who really knows this can explain it better and correct me!

Consider that EMC owns 80% of VMware and only 20% is publicly traded. So some significant proportion of the 53 B valuation for EMC is due to ownership of VMware. That means today when you buy EMC stock what you're actually getting is a bit muddied because the part of the valuation that's made of VMware ownership is independent of EMC performance alone. It's just something that's roughly tracking VMware performance.

Dell and EMC have agreed that 67B is a fair price to pay. That price includes VMware stock of which Dell will retain only 28%. So they don't have to pay the full price. For the remaining 52% of VMware ownership they will issue a tracking stock that will start around $9 and will track VMW at its price from last Wednesday October 7.

I don't know how the tracking stock will work exactly. For example if everyone decides to sell their tracking stock where is the money coming from? If it results in the actual sale of VMW stock to raise the cash that creates sell pressure which should bring the price down unless there are enough buyers. Whatever the details roughly it probably means 52% more of VMW stock is released into the market and no one knows where the price will settle. It's a sweet deal for EMC owners and a bit of an iffy situation for VMW stock owners I believe since Dell is really after EMC and in the process clearing up a messy situation (where VMware was mixed with EMC) at the expense of creating uncertainty for the VMware stock.

HOWEVER, just because current prices are historically very low doesn't necessarily mean they're due to rise any time soon.

also, dividend paying stocks will be less risky than growth stocks because their dividend will attract investors. if their stock price falls, the yield they offer goes up. and assuming the company can still make the dividend payments, this will attract investors who will opt for the safety of yield over the risk of growth. so the odds of big losses on a dividend stock is much less than that of a growth stock.

    Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ) has announced a distribution of Hertz Rental Car Holding Company, Inc.
    (“SpinCo”) Common Shares and a 1-for-15 reverse split. The distribution ratio is 0.2 of a SpinCo share for
    each pre-split HTZ share held. The distribution and reverse split will be effective on July 1, 2016. At that time,
    Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. will change its name and trading symbol to (New) Herc Holdings Inc. (HRI) and
    SpinCo will change its name to (New) Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. and will trade on the New York Stock
    Exchange (NYSE) under trading symbol “HTZ”. Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional HRI shares.
    
So my understanding is, that if you held over 100 shares of HTZ, you will receive 6 shares of HRI (plus .666 shares worth of cash or ~$30), and 20 shares of HTZ.

We can double check this is right by adding it all up and making sure the value is about the same.

(Pre split)  
100 shares of HTZ @ $11.07/share = ~$1107
  
(Post split)  
6 Shares of HRI @ $33/share = $198  
+  
.666 shares of HRI in cash = $30  
+  
20 shares of HTZ @ $44 = 880  

Equals....

$1,108.

I don't think so, their low P/E is actually more due to their success.
their profit margin and earnings are so enormous that people don't believe they can keep this up forever, especially since the main source of these earnings is the iPhone, which dwarves everything else they do.
Sales have been peaking (stable or decreasing volume) as of late and smartphones are almost becoming a commodity (lower margins) .

take away the iphone and Apple is still a great company with overall growing revenue and some established products (cloud, Macbooks, Ipads, carplay, TV, watch,...), but at current price they will suddenly be P/E ~ 30ish : expensive, but still very reasonable vs FANG...

please take a look at their financial statements before concluding apple is ""worthless"" or ""a lost cause"". just the money stash they have overseas would allow them to enter any segment and force themselves into the market (especially if they invest it somewhere where they wont need to cough up repatriating tax )

In summary, trading VIX is very expensive if you have bad timing. Your biggest issue is timing and how long you can take the suffering theta decay. The volatility trade has been popular for a while with inflows into VXX and the futures but we are all sitting here patiently waiting for our VXX to trend higher.

FSLR - So my first question is to why this stock has gone down nearly $40 since march.  I took a look at the quarterly reports and it appears the net sales decreased from September last year until June this year.  Then although they raised, the gross profit % went down the second quarter this year.  So...not looking good.  On top of that, the P/E for the stock has decreased heavily from 14 this time last year to nearly 5.  All in all, there isn't much information that I can extrapolate from to tell you if the stock is over or under valued and the earnings per share has gone down a lot.  I would sell on the principle that you're not seeing it as much as an investment as a gamble. If you're gambling that's fine, but since there is a lack of information and it doesn't seem to be doing well, I would try and place your money in something that is more guaranteed.

CCL - I can't tell if you meant carnival or royal Caribbean here because you put RCL and said carnival, maybe it's both?  Can you reply and tell me which it is?  Since you said you bought at $80 it must have been Royal.

Now, for maximum coin flipness, you need to find a one-tricker with a phase 3 between now and Jan 20, treating an illness with a decent market. Hrm hrm. OPK seems to fit the bill.

2017 predictions this far :

-Oil will zig-zag between a range of 45 to 70. 

theory : at 50, OPEC will put those headlines up, at around 65 US and Russia have profitable pumps to turn on and production overflow


-Gold will do another great year (15/20%)

theory : China and Russia will continue to buy heavily and India will (hopefully by Q3) reopen massive purchases of physical gold 

-EUR/USD will not hit parity, but it will get damn close

theory: i just don't want to believe parity will be reach before the rebound, but i generally agree with the direction of eur/usd

-GBP/USD will loose another 5% max and will not rebound 

theory: it makes sense economically to devalue by 15% (compare to before brexit levels) speculation will push it maybe a bit more but it will not ""go to the abyss"" like our friends at bloomberg usually say. 



Generally speaking, I see Russia having a great year. I see Brazil as an immense opportunity right now, 2017 will definitely be the year to get some positions over there. I'm staying out of Asia generally speaking, india monetary system is fucked beyond my comprehension, China is not on good waters (huhuh) conflit with australia, the china sea, one-china policy with the US apparently and that huge monetary bubble that top executives are starting to talk about (with government permissions, otherwise they'll disappear right?) means (for me) that every big player bought his 20 mansions in California and Vancouver and it may be time for the 300million labor force to pay some way or another and japan has been out of my check list for 20 years lol.

With this you can easily build an algorithm to simplify data acquisition. You can do the same thing with Morningstar, takes quite a bit more digging to find this initially, but it's there.

**Financials base URL:** `http://financials.morningstar.com/ajax/ReportProcess4CSV.html?`

* `t=ticker`

* `reportType=` `is`, `bs`, or `cf` for income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow

* `period=12` - I believe set this to 3 for quarterly

* `dataType='A'` - this is for the ""As Reported"" or ""Restated"" field

* `order='asc'` or `dsc` (I think) - obviously ascending/descending

* `columnYear=5` - premium subscribers can get 10 years of data, but otherwise this will always be 5. If you try 10 it blocks it.

* `number=1` - no fuckin clue what this does, I figured this stuff out a while ago. It could be whether numbers come back in $ / % / 1.00, or it could be the rounding. Keeping it at 1 seems like a good bet.

I'll offer to save you some money (maybe) and then answer your question. I'm also assuming that you're in a similar position to when I was your age. 

Firstly, check out the risks of penny stocks, get on google finance and create a fake portfolio and do some simulated trading. Do that for at least long enough that you know if you're ready to play with real money- months is ideal, but weeks will give you an idea. You'll probably want to read up on investopedia and learn about how trading works well before you touch any money. 

You'll quickly realize that security analysis is not trivial. 

Get on /r/personalfinance and check out their wiki. Check out /r/investing too. 

Grab some books: Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet are probably the best starting points, and you can finish them in a matter of days. 

If that hasn't convinced you that, at your age, you can take huge advantage of compound interest with low principal and tax savings and set you and your friends up to be very very well off (as opposed to the highly volatile penny stocks), then here's your answer:

No. Custodial accounts come with the purpose of restricting all control to the custodian until the child reaches an age or other requirement. There may be exceptions, but I have not seen one.

You didn't describe how much bandwidth this was and how much wireless providers have been paying (per hundred MHz or so) of bandwidth currently. 

Second, it is true, in general, that higher frequencies have shorter propagation distances. There is a caveat to this which is higher frequencies also (in general) allow for faster data transfer. In addition, what companies can do is instead of setting up one tower for 25mi^2 of coverage and 10,000 devices at a time, they can instead set up smaller towers which have 5mi^2 of coverage (with less propagation distance) each with 10,000 devices of capacity, for a total of 50,000 devices spread over 25mi^2. (And to be honest, I'm pulling the numbers out of my ass, but the concept is the same)

Third, concerning technology. New technologies for telecom in general comes from companies like Broadcom, which specialize in making the chips for wireless telecommunication. When new technologies come out and standards are created, phone makers purchase the technologies from Broadcom and put them into their phone while Verizon upgrades its infrastructure. It's not really up to Verizon to keep their technology up to date, other companies do this for them through efficient markets. Do you remember how seamless the transition between 3G and 4G-LTE was?

t3_5wi5yx,dea9keu,"So I am currently looking at $WDAY (Workday) especially for the earnings today. Here is my DD with respect to why I do not believe it will be successful

First, we can see the analysts having mostly on hold, some on buy and some on outperform. What is interesting though is that the price of the stock is currently above the target price for the analysts, reaching into the outperform category.

Second, we can look at previous quarter to this quarter performance. The previous quarter has allowed the stock price to drop as low as 21% after its earnings where they actually reported positive gain in EPS and revenue plus a steady outlook. What triggered this drop was from analysts downgrading the stock after. However, from the previous quarter to this quarter, the stock have seen to be reaching a historical highs with a 29% increase in its price, going above the price off the previous quarter prior to earnings by 5%.

Now, adding up what is happening to this stock, it is showing magnificent growth but there are many reasons to believe that it is due to momentum and not much fundementals supporting it.

We can start by looking at the market cap of this company which is $18Billion. Its competitors are SAP (108B), ULTI (6B), ADP (47B), ORCL (175B), CRM (56.5B). Comparing Workday to these companies, which are veterans in the HRM fields and have more than just HRM and EPM services, the price of workday is wayyy too high. This is considered when we look at the market for online HRM and EPM services combined is approximately 20B to 40B (according to forbes and app research). This is with workday with only approximately 5 to 10% off the market share for these markets.

If we account the evaluations in, a company like Workday cannot and should not be valued at 18 billion market cap even accounting in growth potential. There is just isn't a market that is big enough to contain its price even if it is a market leader let alone only having a small slice of the market currently.

What I believe is that the price right now is just due to momentum of people buying it from its recent good news. Workday did just sign with Walmart to work with them and provide HR software to them along with many other companies through this quarter. This is one risk that the amount of signings they have might actually ""justify"" their value for this quarter and bring the stock price higher after earnings today by reporting a good quarter and a good guidance.

However and overall, I do not believe that they should be valued at this price and today will be the catalyst to bring them down another 10%.

t3_6c5mte,dhte98k,"The selling stampede among shopping-center REITs has engulfed even the strongest names in the space, such as Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE: SKT).  I believe this is an overreaction.  Even so, if you're thinking of initiating or adding to a stake, I suggest waiting until the stock shows some evidence of stabilization in the $25-$27 range.

The retailing industry is going through wrenching changes. I'm not terribly optimistic about malls anchored by big-box department stores like Macy's or J.C. Penney. However, outlet centers, with their discount prices, will likely survive the current shakeout–and thrive over the long run. Tanger Factory Outlets (NYSE: SKT), one of the savviest operators in the space, continues to put up superb numbers. Occupancy as of December 31 stood at 97.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year despite the turbulence in retail. Dividends have been sweetened every year since the company's 1993 IPO. In the past decade alone, SKT has nearly doubled its payout. Small wonder SKT has produced 60% more wealth than the S&P 500 index over the past 10 years (through December 31, 2016), and more than twice as much as the average REIT.

However, a wave of emotional selling engulfed SKT following its first quarter earnings release.  If you own SKT or are contemplating a purchase of the stock, I encourage you to study the company's latest earnings presentation [(here)](https://www.snl.com/Cache/1500098863.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=1500098863&iid=103061) and, perhaps even more important, this [transcript](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-skt-earnings-conference-010100227.html) of the Q1 conference call. From these documents, you'll see that, yes, the recent turmoil in retailing has temporarily slowed SKT's growth. However, the company is doing all the right things to bounce back: freshening up its existing portfolio and filling vacancies with stronger tenants; adapting to changing consumer habits by introducing more food and home-furnishings options in its centers; maintaining a healthy, investment-grade balance sheet; and remaining disciplined with new development.

On this last point, SKT truly stands out. The company won't break ground on a new outlet center unless 60% of the space is pre-leased. Unlike our president in his Atlantic City days, Steve Tanger is no speculative wheeler-dealer! A Dividend Aristocrat, SKT has hiked its payout every year since 1993.  I've been steadily accumulating the shares in my retirement account.

Also, brokerage webinars and platforms encourage high frequency trading, take their advice with a grain of salt, they are usually taking the other side of shitty trader's moves.

If you want to day trade, you need at least $25,000 in your account. At that price point, the difference between like $4.50 a trade (Schwab, Fidelity, and others) and like $7.50 (TD Ameritrade) become pretty negligible when your trades are > $2,000 each.

But Mr. Cuckman, why do I need $25,000?? That's a dumb, arbitrary, big number of dollars. And yes you're right! It is a dumb arbitrary number!!

The reason is: if you have less than $25,000, and you make more than 5 trades in a 5 day period (basically if you average more than one trade a day), the brokerage will flag you as a ""pattern day trader"" and they will limit the amount of trades you can make. Thanks SEC!!

I'm not a fan of the rule because it makes it really difficult to build up a position with trading if you don't have 25 large ones lying around. I think it has something to do with protecting the ""little guys"" from taking too much risk or something idk.

Cons:
- The graph has prices sampled every 5 min.


- The execution of the order is slightly sluggish at rare times, especially during times when the trade volume is high. (I always resort to Limit my buy/sell). This happened to me last year: TSLA dipped to $147 on one of the trading days, and my order to limit buy for $149 got executed on $167 and till then the app was unresponsive.


- Filing tax return might become a pain if you have made a huge number of (free) trades.

t3_6nybos,dkf4o37,"Look up the Creation/Redemption mechanism of ETF's. This is how shares outstanding of the ETFare increased/reduced.

Following the QQQ example, price of the ETF is determined as so:

1.  Gather a basket of securities that represents the index being replicated. Weight/assemble in the same percentages so that you get the same exposure. In other words, make your basket have 11.58% AAPL for example.
2.  Let's assume you have assembled your basket at exactly the correct weights, or close enough, that the AP's (Authorized Participant) are willing to accept (and in turn, the issuer is willing to accept). You now deliver to them your basket that has a notional value equivalent to 50,000 shares of the ETF you'd like to exchange for. 50,000 shares is the standard creation size for ETF's. So let's say your basket is worth $7,000,000. you will receive 50,000 shares of QQQ (assuming the price of QQQ is 140).
3.  The price of the ETF itself is then kept inline with the index by the arbitrage mechanism. If an AP notices that the basket can be assmbled for less than 140, they will assemble more baskets and have the issuer exchange them for shares of the ETF. Buying up those shares will put upward pressure on the basket's constituents. The reverse is also possible, if the ETF is trading at a discount to iNAV (indicative NAV, basically real time calculation of NAV) the APs will take shares of QQQ and exchange them for the underlying basket, depressing the price of QQQ.

This of course affects how you experience ETF price changes, AAPL is 11% of QQQ, while this is huge component, there's still 89% of other securities that can change the value of QQQ. Think of it in extremes, even if AAPL goes up by 100%, if the remaining 89% drops by 50%, you're still looking at 33.5% drop. AAPL can't make up for -50% if it's weight is only 11%.

Sometimes what AP's do if they don't immediately have shares enough to form a creation/redemption unit, they can accumulate the position little by little and calculate how much needs to hedged based on the current composition of the basket's correlation to the ETF itself. Since the components of QQQ are pretty damn liquid, it's easy to keep tracking error to a minimum.

This is why with less liquid/more niche products such as frontier market ETF like EMFM, there's a bigger tracking error between the ETF and the index - it's harder to acquire the underlying components. Sometimes you're forced to deliver a partial basket with a larger cash component and the issuer/AP will charge a higher risk premium to do the trade.

Stuff may have changed in the past 2 or so years, but this is how we used to execute big trades in small products (think average daily volume of 30,000, and we're trading several million shares). Creation/Redemption becomes extremely important. With larger products like SPY and QQQ, we could just VWAP the trade or sometimes even just do a large block trade if the AP/MM gave a good price.

However, this is all split into a [weight percentage](https://www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/financial-professional/etfs/holdings/?ticker=QQQ). 

As we can see in the link that I provided, Apple represents 11.58% of this ETF portfolio. Each holding is not equally represented. So even if lets say Apple had an amazing run for today, it doesn't exactly move as much as you think when there could be a larger percentage of its portfolio doing horrible (hypothetically). 

This is only a small part of it. I'm sure others who are more knowledgeable than me can tell you more about it. ",2,1500354180,[],,,
t3_6nybos,dkda8be,"Most indices are market cap weighted, so Apple being the largest company by market capitalization holds the largest weight of QQQ. There are such ETF/Index ETFs that replicate the holdings of an index, but instead equal weight the components.

Some high frequency and/or algorithmic strategies try to take advantage of any pricing inefficiencies between Index ETFs and the actual index they represent, this is commonly referred to as ETF Arbitrage and/or Index Arbitrage. 

So if you tracked the equal weighted value of all SP500 stocks and simultaneously realize that the Equal Weight SP500 ETF was trading lower than the current price of its underlying securities, you would attempt to purchase the ETF and liquidate upon it meeting your current calculated Net Asset Value (NAV).",2,1500355816,[],,,

When there is a call for stricter security, it does not necessarily mean more equipment. There is usually a lot more equipment at an airport than what is being used on the average day. Think about the high volume times like thanksgiving. Those are the times when the airport is fully packed. On an average day? You might see some machines going totally unused. Think about how walmart has 50 registers and only 5 open on days that aren't Black Friday.

A few years back a report came out about the effectiveness of airport security and the results were not pleasant. Popular opinion is that we have the technology, but training and logistics are key. Trying to push everyone through security quickly leads to errors. While to *some extent* new technologies and machinery will be invested in, companies will be looking at rethinking the security process entirely, and figuring out if the way we do it now is effective enough to justify the cost.

Stakeholders will question the necessity for new machinery, especially after that report. The question will be ""how can we justify new technology if we aren't sure that the current training and policy scheme makes the end users ready to effectively detect a threat?""",2,1507342244,"[['WMT', 1]]",WMT,78.25,86.94999694824219

The market is up 25% since the day Trump was... put into the Oval Office, I'll just say it that way. This is in no way attributable to any policies he's passed, because he hasn't managed to pass any policies. He also doesn't even seem to understand how the economy works. For example, he thinks that a rising stock market wipes out the national debt.

A lot of the reason for this massive bull rush is because corporations think the tax bill giving them massive tax cuts will pass. I worry that it won't. (I also worry that it will.)  Lately I have been worried a lot that this incredible run-up in the market is a Trump bubble, and that because it is irrational, it will also crash irrationally if and when he is somehow removed from office. 

I am also leaning towards the tax bill not passing, because this administration seems to be utterly incapable of passing legislation. So, we need to prepare for what will happen in that eventuality.

The split happened sooner than originally announced. 2-3 weeks ago it was announced that it was occurring yesterday instead of March 2018 as originally thought. The split happened after hours yesterday and both are trading today.
What was DLPH becomes APTV. For every 3 shares of that, you get 1 share of the spin-off, Delphi Technologies (which takes the DLPH ticker.) If you do not have both now, you should probably in the next day or so. If not, contact your broker.

I'm also using Robinhood and I assume it'll take a day or two for them to make the new changes. According to their FAQ, the fractional shares that will be paid out will take 3 - 4 weeks.

t3_7p2o3f,dsebi9b,"I think you've picked some pretty good companies, but I don't think investing in more than a couple of them would be a good strategy. Here's what I think you're missing.

First, all these companies are huge. Many people (myself included) think that the greatest opportunity for growth is in smaller companies. I think you should have a significant portion in small caps (one quarter?A one third? one half? I don't know -- it depends on your age, risk tolerance, objectives). If you're looking for ideas, there are a ton of them, but here are some I think have modest valuations and great growth potential: PRAA, SWIR, CLNE, WCC, EDIT.

Second, several of the companies you mention I think are good companies with great histories, but their glory days are mostly past. When the market values a company like it's going to continue growing as it has in the past, I am quite skeptical that some of these companies can repeat their past and double/redouble in the future. (MSFT, AAPL, V).

You have one foreign company (BABA) that I like, but it is huge. What about foreign companies that aren't so huge. (MELI?)

Finally, let me just suggest that the best investors don't follow the herd. Look for stocks that are being overlooked. You're not doing that with the list you provided.

I am a strong believer that the best way to get wealthy is by investing in individual stocks and avoiding mutual funds, financial advisors, and most of the financial services industry. (I have been investing for over thirty years and most people would classify me as wealthy).

When he lost $100k, what percentage does that reflect? Do you guys have $1million on the stock market? If so, well a brief 10% loss can happen to the best of us. If it's more like $200k, then he's taking waaaay too big, concentrated risks.

Shorts have the potential to put people in debt, because you can be on the hook for losses that far exceed your account balance. His bad decisions can fuck you both over. So while it's his field and so you should obviously give him some wiggle room here, definitely not carte blanche.  Shorts, on the other hand, can be useful to reduce market exposure. So if the market crashes, the gains from your short positions can offset your other losses. So they can protect your finances, just as they can ruin them. TSLA recently dropped from $385 to $293 within the span of a couple months -- so he could have potentially made bank if he had timed it well. But TSLA is already back on the up and up and NFLX is also on a tear. Not that many people are good at timing the market. Even if he's good at shorting, in this market I hope he's not more than 25% short. The market has so much bullish momentum that the odds are against you when shorting. If he's really into shorting, hopefully he also made some smart short decisions like GE or Sears.

If he's (net) losing money in this market then frankly he's really bad at the stock market. *Nobody* is losing money right now. If you guys didn't make at least 20% over the last year from your investments, he needs to take a good look in the mirror and say to himself, *maybe I'm overestimating my capabilities*. It means he's dumber than a passive S&P500 index fund, and significantly dumber than a passive Dow Jones Industrial Average or Nasdaq 100 fund. If he's not beating the indexes, how does he justify that?

Based on what he's shorting it sounds like he might be Aspergers. Sounds like he's only looking at the numbers but not taking into account the context.

That means the bid (current highest price someone is willing to buy at, and literally speaking, a pool of buy limit orders at that price) is $6.48. There are 3400 shares (34 lots of 100) in that pool of orders. Could be one order or many, and there's no way to tell since the order book is aggregated, but 99% chance it's many orders, since the market is big :-)

Other side says the same, but for sell orders. Currently there are 6000 shares for sale at a limit of $6.52. 

In this case thus there is a 4 cent ($6.52-6.48) spread and a 2600 share sell imbalance (6000-3400)

>
>At times, the bid number in the (brackets) next to the bid price is MUCH larger than the number inside the ask brackets next to the ask price - and vice versa. What does this indicate and does it provide any useful information?

In after hours it doesn't mean as much because there aren't very many market centers/exchanges open, so there are bound to be big spreads and large imbalances just due to whatever was left on the books when the market closed. During the day however, if you see persistent imbalances it can mean many things and is absolutely significant. You might think a big bid outweighing a big ask is a bullish sign, but in reality smart money doesn't often show their big trades on the book. More likely, if you see a big block of stock being bid it is because someone is trying to create the illusion of a big buyer, in order to prop the stock up so they can sell. Similarly, a big offer can be a bullish sign since it can indicate a large buyer trying to hold the stock down by creating the illusion of a large sell wall. This isn't always the case but without level 2 access and watching the tape (time and sales) in real time it's very difficult to tell since these bids and asks are mostly put there by high frequency trading algorithms that can change them in literal nanoseconds. To determine what's really going on you need to watch the tape and level 2 order book in real time with professional trading software (DAS is my preferred software for this), and do a lot of reading in order to understand how to ""read the tape"" (there's a term to Google for further research).

At some price (about $104 for this scenario), these percentage gains are equal.  Options buyers are assuming a price increase above that.  Basically this is an indication of high implied volatility.
If you think that the premium is priced too high, you can sell the calls and collect the premium.  MSFT fails to reach $100 by April, you just made $260.  If it does reach $100, you will likely be forced  to sell 100 shares of msft at $100.
Another strategy is to buy the $80 call while selling the $100 one.
The point is, if you think options are priced incorrectly, than you should be able to make money by exploiting that.  If those moves seem risky or not likely to make lots of money, well you have found your reason why the market is priced that way.

> Apple could get immediate scale in premium video, increase its high-multiple services revenue, become less dependent on the iPhone, reduce its exposure to the mercurial Chinese market and guarantee that Netflix does not fall into the hands of archrivals Google or Amazon. All of these arguments are persuasive.

No they're not. Let's discuss scale in services revenue. Netflix's total revenue for all of 2017 was a little over $11 billion. Apple's Services revenue was $8.4 just in the last quarter. Netflix has around 120 million paying subscribers. Across its services Apple has a total of 240 million subscribers. I think it's safe to say that a huge percentage of Netflix subscribers are *already* Apple subscribers. Apple's gain in customers would be only incremental. Last quarter's iPhone revenue was over $61 billion. Adding ~$3 billion in Netflix revenue wouldn't have made Apple any less ""dependent"" on the iPhone. Apple's Chinese revenue was just shy of $18 billion for the quarter; mercurial or not, that's just a vastly larger scale than Netflix. 

Buying Netflix would cost around $100 billion, but that price is based on the value of the business as a whole, which is primarily from the relationship with customers. Finding people willing to give you money every month is hard, and worth a lot of money to some people. But Apple (along with the other potential suitors named such as Google and Amazon) already has a large scale and direct billing relationship with customers; they don't need to buy it so they couldn't possibly get their money's worth from such a transaction. 

> Apple has the resources to dramatically expand the variety of Netflix's content offering

Apple has the resources to expand their *own* content offering, without spending anything extra on buying relationships with their own customers. Think of how much ""must see"" content Apple could buy for *one hundred billion dollars*. 

> Turning Hastings loose inside Apple, potentially as the next CEO, would be a lollapalooza for consumers and shareholders alike. 

This is just ridiculous. Hastings has no experience in hardware, nor in anything remotely the size and scale of Apple. It's a big company and being CEO is a big job.

Both for the same reason - the main thing you want is diversification. $18k is a lot of eggs, there's no need putting them all in one basket. Additionally, with apologies, it doesn't sound like your knowledge of the market is enough that you should be picking individual stocks (for reference, I feel that way about myself as well - as well as most people who aren't full time market researchers, really). 

What you want is a diversified either mutual fund or exchange-traded fund. I would probably buy a fund which tracks market indexes (for example, Schwab's SWPPX or SCHD, but there are many) or a high yield bond fund (a few of the better ones are PRHYX [only available through a Schwab account unless you hit the lottery], PONDX, LHYAX). Stay away from ""sector"" funds - it's safer than an individual stock but not sufficiently diversified. *Edit: Look for ""no load"" [transaction fee] funds with lower ""net expense ratio""s (which my suggestions all are) - other funds will take too much of your money in fees. Again, I recommend considering a Schwab account because they have a huge list of funds they offer ""no load"" - many of which DO have a transaction fee if bought elsewhere.*

Individual stocks can't be ""bubbles"". Market segments are characterized as bubbles if their constituent components are irrationally overvalued. 

Netflix has a pretty high PE Ratio - about $250. Which is about the same as Amazon. 

Nvidia has a PER of about 50, which is the same ballpark as Google at around 64. 

You can't just make handwavey generalizations about companies based on two numbers. 

Apple making overtures to buy an entertainment business would signal to the world that they are out of ideas. That would not be good. Apple's success is predicated on their selling new iPhones.

t3_879tr4,dwbg8gn,"I see three options.

Bau - governments do nothing. This will lead to massive inequality as the capitalist eliminate the other half of the equation (capital + labor = goods). This could mean massive booms for the stock market in the beginning as companies start having insane profit margins. Eventually the lack of well paying jobs will take its toll and the following bust will most likely competly undermine the economy and stock market with it. A new economic system that take into account free labor will have to be rebuilt.

The governments react properly. Most intleegent people have been watching automation or a while and have come up with some good solutions to this changing economic equation. This could be a government program that incentives business to automate but then heavily taxes them after. This program would be managed to have a slow but steady transition  away from labor. Their eliminated workers will go onto a basic standard income or some program paid for by the addition tax on fully automated companies. With this they also have education classes to help people become acustom to the new life and realize their full potential (I personally dont think just giving everyone bsi would work without some mental health improvements for most people. Living as labor in a capitalist society will be vastly different then being an artist in a automatic society.) For the stock market I see this going one of two ways either as the companies become automated they give up private ownership (have a max % of shares owned by one person) or they get rid of the stock market entirely put all the automated companies into one owners hands and just tax the hell out of any capital gains. 


The third option is Governments react poorly. I think this one has the most ambiguity, they could over react or under react. They could help prop up a owners class or they could help prevent automation all together. The options are endless.

Either way automation is a good thing, and inevitable, so we should try and handle the transition well.

Netflix is different because they can create their own content, and you can launch a video streaming service with a subset of content as users focus on watching new things. With music it's impossible to launch without the majors, and people listen to  a mix of new music and old music.",45,1522346603,[],,,
t3_883bds,dwhun6r,"Personally, I would not invest in the company at the moment, for a couple of reasons. I love the company and their service, but sadly that's not enough.

Firstly, Spotify is not making a profit. That might be true for other companies as well, companies like Netflix and Amazon, but the difference is that those companies choose to not be profitable in order to grow big enough and get enough traction to shut competitors out of the market. Spotify simply isn't profitable. They may get profitable at some point, but I just don't see it near term.

Secondly, Spotify doesn't have a moat. Spotify may be the biggest and the best in music streaming, but that's mainly due to them entering the market first. While they are still growing rapidly, they are losing market shares even more rapidly. And Spotify is a one trick pony. The stream music, that's it, meaning that their music streaming business HAS to become profitable at one point or another. Their main competitors on the other hand are backed by Apple and Amazon respectively. They are money machines that can run their respective music streaming services at a loss and prioritize growth over profitability for decades if need be.

The lack of a moat means that Spotify doesn't have the same pricing power as Netflix for example. Netflix could ramp up their prices by 25% tomorrow and keep growing, because they have no serious competition and some of their content is only available through them. If Spotify did the same thing, many of their customers would probably leave for a competitor.

Thirdly, I'm not sure that Spotify, or at least the Dynamic Duo in charge of it, are cut out for operating in a publicly traded environment. Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon are notorious for keeping their cards close to their chest, and they're extremely unpopular among Swedish journalists due to the company being lacking in transparency. Just six months ago, Daniel Ek denied in an interview that they had any plans of going public. But a listing process is not a simple matter, at that point Spotify had probably been preparing their listing for at least six months. Personally, I believe that Spotify's first years on the NYSE will be filled with minor scandals about Spotify breaking with customs and using loopholes to avoid sharing information that is customary to share with the market.

I think that the only things that could get me to change my Outlook on Spotify is 1) if they somehow became able to harness network effects, or 2) became able to successfully launch their own music. It is a problem for Spotify that being big doesn't give them much of an edge toward Apple and Amazon. They have tried to establish network effects through their partnership with Facebook, but it probably hasn't worked out as they'd hoped. And if they were able to produce music of their own that people really liked, they could get a Netflix situation going for them, whereas everything they've produced up until now has gone pretty much unnoticed.",18,1522356546,[],,,

So, in effect, most bumps up and down to a stock price are just noise having more to do with overall economic and market trends than anything specific to one company. 

When you're an investor, you need to calm down and not watch day-to-day fluctuations. Watch for major news (which might be relevant to SQ once or twice a year) and follow the quarterly reports to see if they're on track for what you expect long-term.

t3_8jbdme,dyyuu6k,"Other commenters keep talking about AAPL’s core product, iPhone, like it needs to be feature filled and innovative. The truth is, iPhone has never really been the most innovative or feature packed phone. People have their own reasons for buying it, but nothing that has happened in the past 2 years from a functionality standpoint have negatively impacted most of those reasons. iPhone sells because of marketing, and marketing functions because of cash, and AAPL has enough cash.

This is the core business - cost leadership through cheaper manufacturing costs. Leveraging the volume of iPhone sales to manufacturers allows the iPhone business to keep sourcing costs very low, and margins very high. iPhone has, since its inception, had the highest profit margin per device than any other mobile device on the market.

However, the iPhone business is plateauing - most people who want an iPhone have an iPhone.  Sell a great phone this year, you take away from next year’s sales. The opportunity cost in the next 10 years of selling an incremental amount of iPhones for x ROI is greater, because emerging technologies force Apple to expand the business via supporting rods through their existing products. Apple made similar decisions in the past few years with some results better than others - Watch is growing along with its margins, but TV’s value exists mostly in tandem with other products. CarPlay is doing ok, but has a really long payback period - the car business simply can’t sustain Apple’s preferred margin level. 

Over the next 5-10 years Apple will have to prove to investors that it can win at emerging technologies in the same way as iPhone and Apple Watch. 

In other words, no single stock is safe. If you want a safe investment, diversify. If you like tech, take a look at SHOP, AYX, SQ, Talend, NVDA, AMZN.

For instance, yes, Google makes the majority of its money off ads, but while Facbook does it with a single website, Google does it with several of its it's own websites (search, YouTube, Maps, Gmail, etc), plus its control of advertising on third party sites all over the internet.

Similarly, if you look at Amazon and Apple, Apple's sales are broken down by its 3 main products (iPhone, bigger iPhone aka iPad, and Mac), while all the multitude of things sold through Amazon's ecommerce platform fall under a single heading. That's like saying Walmart is no more diverse than the local shoe store because all the revenue from both come from selling retail products.

Right now, I am long Alphabet and Apple. I think Apple is a strong short to medium term play. The stock buyback program should push it up, and it's current generation of overpriced phones is still selling well. They concern me long term because I don't think their share of the world's smartphone profits is sustainable, and they are not well diversified for a company as large and mature as they are. Don't forget that their growing service profits are predicated on the success of their ecosystem, ie. Its predicated on continued iPhone sales.

I love Alphabet long term. They have one of the best moats around, in their main business, which is a huge money maker. But, the biggest growth catalyst is Waymo.

t3_8n972l,dztq6c5,"The key thing for me here would be to work out what you really want to gain here.

Do you...

A) Want to start early to give yourself maximum exposure to market gains over a long period and give yourself the best chance of setting yourself up with a nice amount of money in your later life.
B) Want to start early and play around and learn about the way the market works, and are prepared to lose much of or pretty much all of your money if that's the way the cookie crumbles, which it easily could.

I would approach the two in very different ways. If A) I would highly recommend reading very seriously about index funds. The power of starting to pump any spare income into these at a young age is incredible, and at this stage could almost be considered mathematically proven to be the best way to use the market to look after your financial future.

If B), then I would start by reading The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, and looking up any terms you don't understand. It's likely there'll be a lot of it you can't really grasp (there still is for me) and you'll probably end up skipping some of it, but it will give you a good basis for understanding what sort of factors are at play.

Some suggestions from an older trader.  :)

- First, consider opening a paper trading account to practice and ""see"" how things work.  Think or Swim (TOS) has a very good paper account, there are others you can look at as well.  

Even if you trade on RH because of the lack of commissions, that app does not have the analysis capabilities that a platform like TOS has.  So you can do your research on TOS and then move to RH.  However it wouldn't surprise me if you end up doing all your trading on TOS eventually.  

- Next, develop a trading plan where you spell out your stock selection process, when to open a trade, when to close it, and what you will do if the trade goes against you.  Few people make a consistent profit without some form of trading plan that calls the above out.

- Lastly, when you do start trading with real money think about solid blue chip dividend paying stocks that are rated as bullish.  

NKE is rated as bullish, but the dividend is only 1.13% this morning.  

DIS is also rated bullish and pays a 1.69% dividend.  There are others that pay a bigger divi, but your initial stock picks are pretty darn good!

Best to you!  -Scot

It's time to learn how to do your dd (due diligence) and learning a bit more about your companies. [This is the financial overview for DIS] (https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=dis).

> Origin Agritech Announces Reserve Stock Split Exchange Date
Origin Agritech Limited (the “Company” or “Origin”) will implement a reverse stock split of its outstanding ordinary shares at a ratio of 1 new share for each
10 currently outstanding ordinary shares.
The exchange date will be July 10, 2018.
The reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstanding shares to 2,787,273 ordinary shares, subject to additional shares being issued for fractional shares and preservation of round lots. There will be no change to the number of authorized ordinary shares or par value.
When the reverse stock split becomes effective, each outstanding ten ordinary shares of Origin automatically will be changed into one ordinary share. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share because they hold a number of shares not evenly divisible by the 1-for-10 reverse split ratio, automatically will be entitled to receive an additional fractional ordinary share of the
Company to round up to the next whole share. The reverse split will also preserve round lots of 100 shares, meaning that if the reverse split results in a
shareholder holding less than 100 shares, the Company will issue, at no cost, additional shares to increase the holding to a full 100 shares.
There will no change to the number of authorized ordinary shares or par value of an ordinary share.

After the deal is public the gap between the share price and offer price usually closes (eg the stock goes up) but not all the way to the offer price since it must reflect risks and uncertainties that the offer will actually be completed. The difference between the two is the markets assessment of he likelihood of the deal going through. The thing is it can take some time for equilibrium to be found and the stock price to adequately quantify these risks. So the stock will usually be volatile until then.

I would find it extremely unlikely Musk would actually take the company private as you would need some type of financing for this plus the debt already on the balance sheet. (10 billion) So you would need to either get someone to write a check for 75 billion, or do an LBO for some portion of the 75B which then gets added to companies balance sheet and would add to it’s already prodigious cash burn.

* FB as a business did not fundamentally change due to future guidance changing. As such if you were a fan of the business before then you are simply getting a discount
* Similar to the above, when something is down that much it is prudent to buy (pending of course it is not fundamentally crap). Buy low, sell high.
* Facebook seems poised for success and growth in the medium term. Instagram is at all time highs of relevance and will continue to be. The main platform while stagnant allows for such hyper targeted advertising that it would be dumb for folks to not leverage this. Instagram advertising also leverages this data.
* I happen to work at a competitor (im sure you can guess) and I can see that Facebook has penetrated the mobile programmatic advertising space big time and it is only continuing. They are just getting into the normalization phase and my bet is they have many a big client to keep signing. Their revenue growth will likely come very naturally... Sales people don't have to do much quite frankly.
* The larger trend at play here. Google and Facebook (and Amazon to extent) are benefitting from literally the biggest revolution since oil. The reason why these companies keep growing their revenues is largely due to the fact that more people are getting internet access via cheap smart phones and cheap wireless. Each time a new person gets the internet Facebook will get growth because who the hell gets a phone and doesn't use Instagram/Whatsapp/Facebook, it is just so core to the experience of having a phone and it is free. Half of the world still has no internet.

So essentially it is a company with a great business, riding the internet wave that allows for businesses to operate a scale that we really can't comprehend. Facebook and Google have products with a billion users.

1 million seconds equal 11 and 1/2 days.

1 billion seconds equal 31 and 3/4 years.

A billion is a number the human mind understands is big but doesn't understand how big. That is the difference between a million and a billion days, a week and a half a lifetime almost. These companies might just possibly have been the luckiest in the world. Google and Facebook really have just revolutionized advertising and quite frankly I think it is good for investors.

For what it is worth, I consider Google/Alphabet an even better buy but really don't see reason not to own either.

The Buffet Indicator would make sense in closed economies, but I’m not sure how relevant US GDP is to market cap, especially when you consider the distribution of individual companies’ contributions to the total market cap— Amazon, Apple (~$2T) and the other giants make up a huge portion of the current market, and serve as a good example of how the biggest US firms generate a lot of earnings from abroad. 

Yield curves can also be tricky to interpret— in general, I think fixed income is the hardest field to understand in finance. But over the last few years, bond markets have been moving toward a more normalized upward sloping yield curve. Overall though, I’m not sure how to interpret yield curves as an indicator of a coming recession. 

The more I talk with academics, the less certain I am that we’re on the cusp of the next bear market; however, I think everyone agrees that our economy is incredibly vulnerable to a depression.

It's completely rational. Therefore, if the economy continues this way, all dips will be bought. All this analysis of high prices is useless. It implies that recessions happen on high prices and nothing else. No. It's economic.

A company with a $1500 share price can be much less valuable with one of a $5 share price.

That said, company’s are worth more when they have a larger cash flow, greater growth prospects, and less risk.

For example, let’s say a company has 1 million shares outstanding and they have earnings of $5million (their earnings per share is $5).

The P/E ratio can be very subjective and the market dictates how valuable a company’s earnings is but, again, it’s determined by growth, risk and cash flow and will change over time. 

EPS of $5 x P/E ratio of 35 = share price of $175.

In terms of why it’s “overvalued” it hasn’t proven anything yet because legal marijuana isn’t quite here yet. Then once it is legal - what is the size of the market in Canada? What will be the market share of a company like Canopy Growth? How does that estimate of market share compare to an estimate of the size of the Canadian market? Does the current estimate of market share consider consolidation/acquisitions coming up? Furthermore, recreational marijuana is still a bit of an experiment in terms of legality - for example - does this apply to edibles and drinks or just the plant/stem/leaves...etc?

Then....what about the international market? How does that factor in? Does the company have prospects outside of Canada? What is that valued at? 

Then....how much value add is there from Constellation Brands? Some? None? Will it hold them back?

Multiples are absurd, so you're left taking a position only on expected future growth from legalization, since that's the reason they're commanding such a high multiple.

That's exactly why I'm not investing in the space. These are the only companies the vast majority of the population can invest in, so they're a crowded trade and im 99% certain that they won't achieve revenue near the levels they're priced at. It's supply/demand unbalanced due to hype. I'm sure there will be some heavily funded private companies that take a large market share once the industry opens as multiples compress due to increased revenues and as investors exit.

If you're trying to scalp intraday or trade the hype run up you can make a profit, but i think it's a foolish long term hold.

I'd look into services that provide for the industry like horticulture lighting, SaaS related to MJ retail or production and distribution. It's going to be fairly commoditized not unlike tobacco as a base product even with strain differentiation.

I think people insert a lot of BS, instability, and unpredictability in the market directly and indirectly and in a balanced mathematical system things like that can stick out like a sore thumb if you look in the right place.  Even in a system as balanced as the market, that graph we are looking at represents one thing - human psychology.  I think we still know how people think better than computers do.    


The instability we introduce into the market with our inevitable shenanigans creates opportunities.

I have thought of quitting many times, but this is what I want to do for a living. Never parking my money again in a fund somewhere, that’s for sure. 

As do many beginners, I was dreaming of easy money, making my first million in 2 years, etc. I made some good money easily when I started. Beginner’s luck perhaps. Then I started giving back all my gains, and then some, which has put me currently in the red. This has definitely changed the way I trade. Now I trade scared, afraid of risk, which of course doesn’t set me up for the big gains I had before. It’s been a slow climb out of the hole I’ve dug, but I can almost see ground zero again. 

Man, trading is hard. Harder than I had ever expected. Two years is newbie territory, but I have learned a whole lot in that time. I have learned to simplify. Like you I also believe in technical analysis. I had all the charts, indicators, and overlays in one, two, then three screens. 6 screens was my goal. I have found all these to be too noisy and distracting. In the end all that matters is pressing the buy and sell button at the right time and sequence. That’s all that’s really there to it. 

React, don’t predict. This is what I keep telling myself now. Cutting losses quick and letting winners run is easier said than done, but if we can do this consistently then we will make money. 

Now I trade on my laptop. Just to make sure that even when I travel or go on vacation my trading setup is consistent. All I need to place an informed trade is a daily one-minute chart, volume at the bottom, a 20 SMA overlay, and a time and sales tape on the side. I even stopped looking at level 2 data. Again, too noisy for me. Of course it goes without saying that research and watchlist has been done the night before. The results? I will post IF successful, lol.

However in order to reach that point the company will have to spend a fortune which I think may not happen especially since their revenue is very low. 

If you know of IQ when this stock hit the US market the hype made the stock price go from $15 to $40 in a matter of 2 months. Ever since then the price has been cut in half and has been hovering around there for the past 3 months. IQ even had a platform and everything was functioning, but the association of it being the ""Netflix of China"" made people hop onto the bandwagon without the proper research and people got burned. 

Overall point is, know when to exit if you have made the money. I could be wrong and this stock could go up, but from my standpoint I've made plenty and everything who got in under $5 should definitely sell out and play it safe at this point until further news of the company having demonstrated a physical product is underway.

I started a substantial long position (2023) at $.95 a little over a year ago when I saw that TJ Rodgers invested 10M in the company. I also just opened a second, shorter-term position (2020) at $4.65.  I’m very familiar with company fundamentals, outlook, mgmt., and products. HUGE growth ahead, especially in emerging weak/off-grid markets.  Totally agree with above poster that the best play (if you had to pick one) is a solar MLPE company, as they supply components used on global installs and aren’t limited to one regulatory stack or market.  

A good thing to keep in mind about Enphase micros is that the company is shrinking them WHILE increasing power yield. The micro will be the size of a pack of cigarettes soon (WITH the integrated junction box) and behind every solar panel in the future.

Solid fundamentals...even more solid leadership- (mostly ex- Cypress Semi and Sunpower Vets).

t3_9oeqnw,e7uxg9i,"Solar is a great technology that is only getting better, cheaper and more efficient. I see this as an industry that will only keep growing. The only issue might be some slow down in growth as the Federal tax credit scales back.        
Currently, the tax credit is 30% which expires Dec 31st 2019. It then drops to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021 and finally falls to 10% in 2022 and onwards. Although, its possible if democrats win the mid terms this year, and win the white house in 2020, these credits are extended or reworked. But also possible they are cut entirely if Trump wins again (this is pure speculation on my part).      

If you are looking to invest in solar, I personally believe you're better off investing in the inverter companies, as opposed to trying to pick a panel manufacturer. Enphare and Solar Edge make the 2 most popular/ best inverters. Although Solar edge is the leader with their ""Power optimizers"", Enphase uses Micro Inverters which are less popular, although I believe these are prefered for larger installs. (I have a Solar Edge inveter on my Residential solar array).

I personally think most people answering are incorrect however even if they are meaning well. Borrowing money at a low rate and investing at a higher risk adjusted rate is what a bank does, and you can too if your rate is low enough.

I currently have a 60% leverage in net worth from loans. However because of my position I have the loan with an Intrest cost of Sub 1%. At that pricing point it's really a no Brainer. But at 6% it's stupid honestly unless you have a really impressive track record. And even then... No. Don't.


If you can get an Intrest of atleast below 3.5% then it's on the table. However even with a great rate, you have to take into account your own portfolio size to avoid getting losses larger than your loan, and then getting knocked into negative net worth from the loan. ",3,1540816011,[],,,

You don't know much about the stock market. We're expecting a recession in the next 2-4 years.

A lot of investment professionals are actually predicting an average 5% return over the coming years, because of that.

However, the concept is right. Borrow money, use it to get more money, keep the difference. This is basically what hedge funds do, and literally any business ever. It's also what people do with mortgages; it's better to invest in stocks than pay off your mortgage because of that. Same concept really. Just a couple of additional things:

* You can borrow yen and euros at a near 0% interest rate. You can get leverage in your currency for less than 6%.
* You can put half this money into bonds, leveraged to give the same return as equities, which will actually decrease your portfolio risk without affecting returns, because bonds are decorrelated.
* Same with commodities and other asset classes.
* Usually, loan providers need collateral. My broker gives me access to leverage worth 70% of my portfolio, but i'm not sure how you'd get more than that.",2,1540820116,[],,,

***GM*** \- Current Price = $37.54; Trailing 12-Month EPS = $7.41; P/E = 5.066x

TTWO is likely suffering from the red dead online controversy, in which players arent happy that buying gold bars speeds up gameplay by such a large margin.

It could also have to do with a shift in the market. The fact that TTWO stock price is dropping by $25 from just a month ago, after the release of Red Dead 2 which is the second fastest selling next to GTA 5, might mean the market is shifting.

The fund has over $700 billion in assets and charges 0.14% annually (probably one of the lowest) and since you have an account with the largest fund manager in the world, they would not charge you for any commissions.

t3_a6dxdo,ebu80vf,"The problem with investing in a single company is that you never know what will happen. Could Google be doing great in 30 years? Absolutely! Could it be the next General Electric and be on it’s way down and out? Of course!

So if you just want to invest money and forget it for 30 years, the safest bet is something like the Vanguard Total Stock Market index fund. That is an index that represents the entire stock market—think of it like you invested in every company. It’s hard to pick individual winners and losers; the stock market as a whole is more likely to make money for you 

Another good option would be like a 2055 target date fund, which has a small percentage in bonds and will automatically rebalance and increase the amount in bonds as the target date approaches. Again, I like vanguard because it’s low cost, but there are other options out there. 

The point of these types of index funds is that you’re betting on the market as a whole rather than individual companies. What happens to Disney if people prefer Netflix? What happens to Coke when we learn sugar kills people? What if you had bet on Gateway computers rather than Apple? Well, now at least you would essentially also own Netflix or Apple—you’re diversifying your risk and opportunity to cash in on unexpected wins. 

There’s nothing wrong with picking stocks,but if you just want to pick them and forget for 30 years, you’re going to miss a lot of things over those decades that could matter. ",6,1544879664,[],,,

Currently, GE is going down. It is more likely to keep going down that to reverse up.

Buying GE is a counter-trend trade; it goes against the current trend.

It's generally a lot safer to wait until it starts a new uptrend first, then buy. That means waiting for it to cross above its 200 day moving average.

So as most have said, if you expect poor guidance, there's no logical reason to keep your money in the next earnings quarter. Most people will program it to sell at close of the bell so that they reap any last minute rises.

Now, the real reason intel fell is good 'ol mathematics. If you look at their chart, they have for the past half year or so had a ceiling at 50. Can't really get above that. Who cares what the reason is, that's the ceiling. So ending at 49.88 or whatever is not a good sign that you're going to break out. Additionally, lower resistance has a positive slope. This is very important. if your lower resistance has a positive slope, then you're going to see a break out when the lines cross. But if you draw a line of where this intersection occurs, it's like a month out from now or something. So if I know I have about a month until break out, and I'm already at 49.88, then it makes more sense we drop to the slope line, which was between 46-47. And what do you know, that's exactly where it went to.

Now that said, I was a bit too squeamish to go on puts for intel, so I did SOXS calls. This is a good alternative. SOXS is a bear market bet, so it will probably rise a bit tomorrow as AMD, WD, INTC etc all get dragged down.

Has everything Elon musk done been right? Hell no. But he’s also doing something no one else has done and I think it’s ok to make some mistakes along the way.

Stick 2.5k into stocks. Pick different sectors. For example 500 into Financials such as JPM or C. 500 into tech such as MSFT. 500 into retail. Can play earnings with 500 if you want. 

The stocks I've picked are conservative and will have steady regular growth. You can be riskier and pick more volatile stocks. A good indicator is how volatile a stock is how much % it is shorted. P.E ratio is another. But investors will tolerate a high p.e ratio for a growth company. (No do not pick MU despite how tempting that p.e ratio looks.)

500 into options. Long calls (NOT NAKED) are what I'd recommend and with expiration dates at least a few months ahead. Buy options for stocks that will build up prior to earnings and then sell right before earnings release when premiums are high. Do not hold through earnings. The IV will drop and unless you had big movement in the right direction you'll be worse off. Remember you are trading the option itself, not trying to execute it.

t3_ata69z,eh1upcv,"Just some numbers to think about:

Electric cars account for 2.1% of cars in the U.S.

This number doubled from 2017, when there were 199k EV's sold.

In 2018, EV sales went up 81% to 361k units sold. Tesla production in that time span went up 73.8%.

191k of those EV's sold in 2018 were Tesla cars, that's 53% of all EV's. And that's only the U.S.

&#x200B;

EV growth was up 25% from 2016 to 2017. Tesla only sold 50k cars in that period.

EV growth in the US is strongly correlated to Tesla production. Keep in mind, the gigafactory is not even finished until 2020. There is another one being built in Shanghai, China, another market growing hugely in demand for Teslas. Tesla is also the only non-domestic EV brand in China that is in the top 10 EV sales. Tesla production is still at its infancy, and with 3 gigafactories to be finished in the next 5-10 years, I'd say there is a lot to be hopeful for. As for competing companies, keep in mind they are only just now experimenting with EV's and they will not be able to compete with this level of technological advance or production for some time.

Edit, Edit: so thinking about this a bit more,  but really think about what the initial price is and why some pop and some don't. Initial pops probably serve a few different reasons: incorrectly pricing of the offer (lost money on the raise), demand by investors to take on excess risk over market, retail (mom/pops) investors that invest soly on the name and excitement, free press, etc. A non pop event could be good, means that it was priced correctly and the company most probably achieved it's raising goals, however on the flip side could indicate the market doesn't think the business can produce the future cash flows indicated by the stock price.

That being said, as a company is the pop really good? Probably not, they're leaving money on the table as they could have raised more cash if they priced it correctly. There is probably some private money play going as well behind the IPO, I think (my opinion) IPO markets are semi to weak efficient whereas the overall market is more semi to strongly efficient.",2,1551766811,[],,,

t3_azq7az,ei9pyai,"So it seems the key thing you weren't aware of was the halt risk. Read up on the Nasdaq halt rules. They're well known and the key thing to watch for on BPTH was when it started skipping up dollars at a time on air (very very low volume with a huge spread). Generally with trades like this you don't just want insane upside moves that cause a halt every time the stock reopens. You want something liquid that is trending all day. On the first day, even though the stock only went from like 7 to 14 it traded almost 100 million shares so holding even 2000-3000 shares throughout the day would have made you just as much if not more money and there was very little halt risk.

If you watched BPTH from the early morning on the 2nd day, you would have seen it only took four minutes for it to halt the first time. That's a prime warning that you want to be VERY VERY CAREFUL and if you don't know the halt rules you should stay away completely. The first reason for this is you won't know when it's going to halt again. The 2nd and more important reason is that the halts it did have on the 2nd day were mostly LUDP circuit breaker halts (meaning the stock went up or down too fast in a certain timeframe), but if there are too many of those the exchange can and will issue a T12 halt, which means they are requesting additional info from the company on the trading activity, which could mean it could be halted for months. 

The reason it dropped so hard after the initial downside halt after it peaked at 73 is that the new halt rules now say that if the stock is halted while falling, it will remain halted until it can open with less than a small percentage drop (I don't remember the exact percentage) from the last time it *would have been halted*. The problem with this is that if the stock is at 73, gets halted and Nasdaq determines that if it reopened it would not have enough bids to stay above, say, 65, it will delay the reopening and the reference price resets to 65. This is almost certainly what happened when it halted at 73, reopened at 60 and then halted again. After people saw the big drop and rehalt into 60, they all pulled their bids, and from 60 down to 35 or whatever ridiculous drop occurred after that, there was never any potential for it to open higher so Nasdaq just left it halted. The result, obviously, is the halt at 60 and then reopen 50% lower with no chance to escape. 

Anyway, read up on this stuff. You still have 35k...that's plenty of money to keep trading. Just live and learn and definitely stay away from psycho stuff like BPTH when it gets that wild especially if you don't know the rules. Also, learn a little something about float rotation and short squeezes. There was absolutely no fundamental reason for the stock to run like this. Yes it had news, but the reason it ran so hard that 2nd day was due to trapped short sellers and failures to deliver that resulted in forced buyins by brokers who had clients trapped on the short side.",32,1552303886,"[['BPTH', 3], ['VERY', 2]]",BPTH,22.0,29.84000015258789

3. DO NOT day trade, you will get chopped up fast as you have seen since things can change on a dime.

5. Learn to set profit targets and trail your stop loss. Or don’t but you obviously know what happens if you don’t. 

6. Remember that in essence you only lost 10k thats not a big deal, you are lucky that you had gains that you mostly lost. The gains can come back quickly and will stick around if you build a plan and stick to it. Anything else is gambling and could fuck you up.

1. Stocks are probably the worst instrument to day trade thanks to the BS rules like halts due to which you got screwed. Not that you can't be successful with stocks but why would you go for them when there are better instruments. If you want to trade directionally, then trade futures or cryptocurrency. If you are not stubborn on trying to trade direction, options is also a good instrument but involves a lot of education.
2. Read about Kelly Criterion and Risk of Ruin. Even if you have a positive expectancy strategy of say 99% chance of winning, if you are betting it all in 1 go (or in this case 1 stock), that 1 in 100 times that the stock gets halted and loses 50%+, you will lose a huge chunk of your equity, which no one wants.
3. When you are day trading, you are competing with HFTs and algos. Most of the legendary scalpers like Paul Rotter quit for a reason. There's a reason why the richest people are almost never day traders. Although I know quite a few day trading educators who are filthy rich but as you can guess they didn't make the majority of their net worth day trading.

Index funds, which are passively managed, are the best bang for your buck hands down! Allocate for about 80% equities and 20% bonds. There are indexes for many styles for both stocks and bonds. Within that 80% allocation go 40% S&P index, 30% mid-cap index, 20%small-cap index, 10% international index, respectively. Within the 20% bonds just use an index as well.

I do some construction contracting for a local hospital as a side job; mostly when maintenance falls behind when a larger project takes priority. (1) I am definitely not 'free from the control and direction of the hiring entity' and I don't understand how anyone doing contracting work would be. (2) I'm doing contracting for their maintenance department whose job I'm essentially doing so it definitely isn't 'work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business'. (3) I am 'engaged in an independently established trade', so I fit 2/3 of these bullets.

So I'd be an employee if I worked in CA (which I gladly don't). In fact I'd be an employee at about a dozen businesses around town! I'm sure they would all love having to pay for separate workman's comp plans to cover me as their employee (as well as me paying for my own for the jobs that wouldn't qualify). Taxes would certainly be more fun to fill out and I'd have to change how I bill for tools and materials as an employee at each place. Oh and I'm sure they'd love to be in charge of my schedule... lol good luck with that.

On a side note LYFT's financials are a disaster and there's no way automated driving becomes commonplace within the next 5 years.

The 3 must reads, in my own opinion. They contrast each other very well, giving you a great unbiased foundation to build upon. Top 3:

Mindset by Carol S. Dweck
(A non-finance must read for anyone in business. Start here even if it's not about finance.) 

One up on Wallstreet by Peter Lynch
(The best book to start with on finance.) 

Little book of common sense investing by John Bogle. (A must read to understand what you are up against. The best book on investment fallacies and index funds by Bogle himself) 


Other great reads in no particular order:

Built to Last by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras
(a fantastically researched work on how companies are built to last forever) 

Good to great by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras
(In my eyes the best book written on business. How do companies built into something truly great.) 

Stocks in the Long run by Jeremy Seagal

Little book that Builds Wealth by Pat Dorsey

Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor by Howard Marks 

A Random Walk Down Wallstreet by Burton Malkiel (the book I personally started with. A great book on fallacies in investing. I used to have it at the top, but it has some slight flaws and Bogles work is simply better and more modern) 

The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham
(A snap must-read, however not a good place to start. Mr. Market can be dry and hard to follow for the newbies.) 

The Warren Buffet Way by Robert Hagstrom
(A great book if you want a modern view on traditional ideas, as well as a focus on Buffet) 

 Security Analysis by Ben Graham
 (A textbook but a great one. Read this one if you start to understand but still can't answer the question ""how to people set price targets or valuate companies"") 

Last but not least, I'd get through all of Warren Buffets shareholder letters written for the Birkshire shareholders. It's insightful and gives great insight on what matters when looking at companies according to one of the greatest men of all time. 

Not a book, however a great place to read is investiopedia. Quality, unbiased and factual articles explaining terms and concepts. Grest place to learn.

AbbVie also makes Humira, a drug that I've seen advertised as much as any, and one that I've personally been prescribed due to an auto-immune disease.  I wonder which price they'd need to advertise for this.  The price for the drug itself is over $5000 (for a month's supply).  I don't know the exact price, because I've never paid it.  My insurance covered most of the cost, but I think I had to pay somewhere between $100-$200/month.  But Humira also has a copay card that _I_ _think_ most people that have insurance qualify for, which left me paying $5/month.

I don't take Humira anymore, I now take Enbrel, sold by Amgen.  Similar drug, similar price.  I pay $10/month with their copay card.

So again, I wonder which price they'd list.  I'm imagining they'd market the price with their copay card, with maybe some fine print showing the full price.

Edit: Also, since lots of people think it's wrong for these companies to advertise at all, I'll give the perspective of someone who's needed to take one of these medications that heavily marketed. Many of the drug commercials I've seen are used for people with autoimmune diseases like Crohn's, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriasis, etc.  For people with these conditions that take these medications, their treatment is ongoing - there's no drug that can cure it, so they might need to treat it with medication indefinitely.  When you need to manage a disease indefinitely, it can be beneficial to know what your options are in terms of medications.  You might think this should be left to the doctor, but there's no harm in a person knowing they have options - a doctor isn't going to prescribe these medications to a patient that doesn't need them, and medications do sometimes stop working (which is why I switched).

Also, some people may have stopped taking Humira because the injections were painful.  Their latest advertisement addresses exactly that issue - they have some new version that hurts less.",5,1557362818,[],,,

They are trying to increase inflation. Doesn’t mean they will, tech productivity has been reducing cost everywhere, but they can try. 

Target is 2% and been running below for too long. Too much debt in system and if you can’t grow your way out (GDP growth) then you can inflate. $20T in Federal debt is still $20T 33.3 years from now at 3% inflation while 3% X 33.3years = 100% GDP growth making your Debt/GDP ratio half what it was even with zero real GDP growth. 

Interest on federal debt is something like 30% of annual budget. If they one day can issue 30year bonds at 0% a lot of problems fade away. 

Everything is relative. Some countries are already at 0%. USA can’t set rates too high above Europe and others otherwise USD rises and at some point makes USA products/services/tourism too expensive and causes a slowdown and job loss spiral. 

Hyperinflation is probably not coming. If inflation does actually come you want to hold non-depreciating assets like precious metals or real estate or stocks or various other financial assets.

Once their auto drive is fully functional and on the streets, Tesla will become the world's largest automatic electric taxi fleet in the world. The will revolutionize the taxi industry, wipe out Uber and Lyft, while also making a positive impact on the environment. What's to stop tesla from using these automatic electric vehicles from also disrupting the package delivery industry which is growing everyday because of internet delivery services like amazon. It would make package delivery finally cheaper and eco friendly. 
Also once the automatic driving is fully functional, tesla will roll out the semi trucks which will also revolutionize the trucking industry. Tesla is said to be developing an insurance division to help consumers insure their tesla owned vehicles. 
Tesla will become a monster powerhouse as it's technology will be utilized to help the world change towards more eco friendly. 
Tesla's new super charge stations with solar panels will also revolutionize another industry, the gas industry. As super charge stations start popping up all over the world, gas stations will be in decline and eventually abolished.

* Automobile industry

t3_cr9ncs,ex6lqep,"OP makes highly dubious claims and does not pass a basic smell test:

ALL CLAIMS MADE ARE DUBIOUS: Implementing 130+ papers in 7 months is highly implausible. This would require:

- Insane productivity.

- Implausible access to pricing and news data resources (which are often not freely available).

- Expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, finance, and data science. OP had to implement financial, time-series and linguistic feature engineering pipelines, as well infer the architecture and hyper-parameters used in all papers AND train all these models. ALL WITHIN 7 MONTHS. All while previously being a trader professionally i.e. not likely an expert in many of these fields.

- OP also claims he ""web scraped"" all the data which is highly unlikely as price datasets are often sold for a pretty penny and not publicly available in the detail described in several of these papers.

- Down the thread, OP says he does not know what a ""meta analysis"" study is al the while being capable of implementing 130+ papers. So someone who is an expert in ML, statistics, data science and finance does not know one of the most basic types of scientific study. All the while essentially engaging in a meta analysis study.

- OP describes himself as ""a trader at a Tier 1 US bank"" to lend credibility to his post: in itself that description is ridiculous and sounds like a naive attempt at instilling authority.

- When others encourage OP to publish results, he answers evasively: ""probably a bit deep for a public forum but I was kinda glad to see the back of that work. It was an awesome learning experience but it's pretty soul destroying experimenting with tonnes of stuff that just doesn't work.""

EVIDENCE PROVIDED: Non-existent.

All OP has to show for all this work is a hastily written Reddit post with dubious claims. There is no proof of the work done whatsoever, no code samples, not even result tables or graphs. The discussion of basic results are often made criticisms of this line of research.

MOTIVATION:

At the end OP shills his cryptotrading bot. This post was likely all just purely made-up to market his cryptotrading bot service. OP uses some common criticisms of market prediction research to garner authority as a wizz-kid to attract people to his crypto scam.

What's worse many on HN and Reddit seem to gobble it up naively. Seemingly because OP is critical of something that is popular to criticize.",6,1566047727,[],,,

The way i see it, if someone with no knowledge of what theyre doing gets between 3-5% thats basically expected in a normal market but its good because it means they didnt invest in any trash choices, which is a good thing.

Now, someone in that category making 5-9% would be fantastic, but for them it could be considered a gamble/good luck as they just sort of pick based on their personalized intuitions. Maybe theyll keep getting good returns, maybe theyll get not as high next year, who knows really.

Someone who knows what theyre doing making 3-7% id start to question their choices. 7-10% is the sweet spot where youre actually making decent returns and still havent broken past 10% yet.

Warren Buffett said before if he had a million dollar account, he could get between 20-50% returns per year. Sounds like its too good to be true, but if you know what youre doing, have the time and resources, and this is like your passion, i could see someone who invests for themself and does full research with proper diversification to normally making between 12% and 17% a year, which is great.

1. never hold them overnight you can always buy em the next day. I like sleeping at night.
2. pick you entry points carefully for me it varies if it falls out of the cloud watch it and be patient.
3. never buy when the rsi gets above 10- 15

5. lastly once your in manage your gains or losses and pick your exit points carefully. Above all don't be greedy for me its a 10 to 15% gain and i'm out.Remember what they say bears make money bulls make money and pigs get slaughtered

While $500 is more than enough to get started, especially now that there are numerous brokerages that do not charge trading fees, I would recommend you do some more research and reading before taking the plunge. This will save you a lot of hardship in the long term.

A lot of people who get in to investing don't appropriately understand the risks or how to objectively evaluate investments. They then jump in hoping it will help them get rich quick or double their money quickly, not understanding that investing is not a means to generate wealth from little to nothing but to grow your current excess wealth to over extended periods.

I would recommend diving deep in to Investopedia for basics and fundamentals and once you feel comfortable with terminology read the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham.

If you choose to ignore the advise above or don't have the patience or mental fortitude to deal with short term investment depreciation while waiting for the all but certain long term appreciation, do yourself a favor and take your $500 to a black jack table, you'll save yourself the time and frustration.

* **AMAT:** provides semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME), services and software related to semiconductors, displays, solar photovoltaic and related industries across the world

* **SWKS:** established leader of radio frequency (RF) components for smartphone makers and other elctronics manufacturers

Here's how I deal with it. 

* I sell options against my stocks. I  can't sell stocks that I sold options against. When I look at my stocks, and the option premiums, I have additional data points and revenue - and that makes me happy.  
* My stock list includes lots of metrics but especially the important why - why I bought it. All the reasons, even the silly ones. I update the list as needed. 
* My stock list includes the analysts' price targets for the stocks - and those are usually a year out. 
* I note when any dividends will be paid. I don't want to miss a dividend - that helps me keep my stocks too.
* My stock summary shows all my stock holding totals by allocation (health, finance, tech, industrial, REIT, etc.) If I sell a stock it will mess up the allocation. The work involved in making that right again often stops me from panic selling.

Before you start investing this and that, there's something else you need to learn that is more important than investing, and that's yourself. You need to learn to control your emotion. What I mean by that is when the stock price fall, you can't panic, fear, and just sell your shares. You can't let your emotion of fear dedicate your decision. Also, you need to be patience. If you are hasty you can miss out on important information that may impact your portfolio. You need to able to have faith in your investment even though they may be in negative. But most importantly you need to study and research your investment thoroughly. What's going around the world that can impact your investment (for better or worse)? What can happen in the world that can impact your investment (for better or worse)? If you have done your study and research, and you purchased your investment, then you should be confident in your investments even when the stock is not doing well.

Second: stock market will crash eventually. It will happen, over and over. But, they will always recover, and they will break new record every. Single. Time. Yes, not every single company is gonna make it, but majority of the companies will. This is why you need to understand what you're investing. For example when market crash happen, Microsoft will crash. Disney will crash. Apple will crash. Amazon will crash. But they will recover because of what these companies represent, and their foothold in the world. Like I said over and over, you have to study and research the company in your investment. That's why I personally believe studying and researching the investment is the most important job because you're trying to build strong portfolio that can withstand the crash, and thrive afterward to break new records. And don't be persuade by what the social media, news, or people around you are saying. They can't predict the future, but you can research and see what is going around the world that can impact your portfolio.

Third: time in the market will beat timing the market for most investors.

Fourth: if you don't feel comfortable investing with large amount of money, start with $100. Get your emotion use to the feeling of stock market going up and down. Also get experience in meanwhile. When you feel comfortable and confident, invest $200, $300, and so on until you feel completely good about investing in thousands of dollar.

Last, and this may sound contradicting, know when to cut your loss. This comes from knowing what the company is going through. For example, if the company is going down from lawsuit, or legal issue, or whatever it is that will bankrupt the company, it's best to cut your loss and move on. Again, this is why you want to study and research your investment. Check if they have a records of lawsuit that they seem to unable to grow. See if there's law that's gonna change the fundamental of the company. Etc, etc, etc.

I started trading about 1 year ago and had ups and downs.

I’m going to tell you about how I approached it and then you take from that what you like.

Firstly the way I looked at it was, what is my goal?
Short term ?
Long term?

It is important to identify this because it will depend on whether you invest in ETF’s, index funds, stocks or options!

ETF’s are more tax friendly, track indexes and are on a share basis which means you can track the price throughout the day, I’m not quite to sure about indexes  to be honest.
An ETF will monitor a set of different stocks and most times they have specific sectors they track

As for your question with how much? 
Anything is fine the best way to trade is to invest the same amount each time you invest and diversify it in companies you see down the line 10-15 years from now.

And my personal advice and I’m sure other people will agree, instead of investing one lump sum of $500 into a an ETF or a stock of your choosing spread it out across different prices. This will help your average cost be lower.

Because the stock market prices change daily when stocks have many people buying and selling you can have different opportunities of buying a stock at a lower than avg cost, and sometimes a higher than average cost it’s all about how you look at it.

When you sell (write) a contract option you are selling the obligation for you to buy or sell at a certain pre-arranged price, at a pre-arranged time.
So, for example if you sell a put option you are signing a contract to buy a stock at a certain price, at a certain date - no matter what the actual price of the stock is on the given day.
As a seller, you take on risk. What if the stock is worth less than the agreed price? Then you loose money when you actually buy those stock as agreed.
This risk is worth something. This something is the premium for the contract.

Buying the put option reduces your risk (you are sure to get a certain price, no matter the market moves). So you have to pay the premium.

But also, consider what exactly you are buying. Let's take time out of the equation (which is related to theta). Say you bought a $550 TSLA call when TSLA was trading at $560 (obviously these number are not reality but it's easier to understand this side if we use in the money options). Without any time value, that call option should be worth $10 ($560 is the cost of the stock and you can buy it for $550, so the intrinsic value is $10). 

Now let's say TSLA moves 5% up from $560...so now trading at $588. Well you can still use your call to buy TSLA at $550, which puts the intrinsic value of the call option at $38 ($588 minus $550). 

So the intrinsic value of your call went from $10 to $38, a 280% gain. Even though the stock only moved 5%.

The longer the span is, the more likely it is that something happens that alters the value of the stock. So ""the market"" factor becomes less significant, because there's more room for factors that are significant for this specific stock.

I think it will be great once IND is successfully passed by the end of the year 🤞🤞

Sukhbir Brar no they are focusing on Pharma biotech , over supply issues in Canada , they have the 25,000 sq ft and that is it they are focusing their resources on the IND with FDA for microPEA if successful then they can start phase 2/3 for all the conditions they talked about in the past

And making cannabis molecules like cbd and thc in algae.  Takes 4 days, the molecules are already separated and pharma quality using this method - if FSD Pharma and Solarvest can prove it works commercially changes the pharma game

FSD Pharma owns equity and the majority of the debt of solarvest.  FSD Pharma are ultimately the majority shareholder of solarvest.  FSD Pharma owns 100 percent of prismic Pharma.  FSD Pharma owns over ten percent of Scicann.

I think FSD has a specific strategy imagine having the cleanest balance sheet out of all the cannabis companies but focused on Pharma hopefully by Canada day the financials look strong and appealing for institutional grade investors. I think in this market balance sheet is all that matters at the moment if they can prove themselves by having a strong balance sheet it could help...

All the other LPs are trying to stay alive trying to figure out how to stay away from becoming bankrupt I think FSD Pharma was wise to stick with Pharma rather then buildout during over supply glut hope they can bring it back to a billion dollar company and make it stay there that is when we can all relax and those that held on hopefully will be happy. Now let’s pray it happens and support the company anyway we can until we get there. 💪🏼👍🏻

Edit: Here’s the full scoop per Yahoo Finance

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (NYSE American: ZOM)(“Zomedica” or “Company”), a veterinary diagnostic company, announced today that the Company has filed a U.S. patent application covering compositions and methods for five fecal parasite detection assays for detecting parasitic infections in cats and dogs designed for use with its ZM-020 pathogen detection device. The patent application details optimal fecal sample amounts for parasite infection detection. In early 2019 Zomedica previously submitted a U.S. provisional patent application covering compositions and methods for detecting urinary tract infections (UTIs) designed for use with its ZM-020 pathogen detection platform to detect urinary tract infections in dogs and cats. The initial library of pathogens for urine samples is focused on the identification of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas bacteria species and three types of crystals and white blood cells. The initial library of pathogens for fecal samples is focused on the identification of hookworms, roundworms, whipworms, coccidia and giardia.

The assays are intended to be used with the ZM-020 pathogen detection device which is a miniaturized Raman spectroscopy platform capable of broad-based pathogen identification in minutes. The technology used in the ZM-020 device, which is currently being developed by Seraph Biosciences, Inc. (“Seraph”) has the potential to achieve reference lab sensitivity/specificity in-clinic during the point-of-care experience, which could result in better pet outcomes and faster recovery. The ZM-020 diagnostic platform requires a small fecal sample preparation.  Additionally, the platform has automated analysis and does not require specialized staff training. Assuming development work is successfully completed Zomedica expects the commercial launch of the ZM-020 fecal test to occur by 2022 and urine tests by 2023. Zomedica is strategically committed to a singular commercial focus of its endocrine diagnostic platform, TRUFORMA™ through 2021.

1-Be valuable at your job, pick up new skills, don't get laid off. You can only buy the bargains, and avoid selling if you still have a cash flow to cover your obligations.

2-Dollar cost averaging to pick up bite size pieces is your friend. Most of us fail to catch the knife at the bottom, but for the next 6-9 months I'd say odds are good you will get stocks at prices which folks buying 6 months ago (or more, depending on severity) would have been quite envious of, and almost invariably, will again be pretty envious of in 3 years or so.",14,1583911016,[],,,

The key is not to try and time the market. If you go looking for the market bottom even after a 20% plunge from all-time highs, you're still taking a big risk. It's safer wait for signs of stabilization or even recovery, even if that means missing out on some of the upswing.

This mostly applies if you're looking to invest a large chunk of your cash reserves at once. If you're dollar cost averaging into the market -- say, investing $500/month instead of dumping an entire $5000 into the market right away, then you take a good chunk of the downside risk out of it (but not all of it by any means).

>With this coronavirus giving all these discounted stocks, would it be wise to wait it out a bit more or keep an eye on the news and invest accordingly over this next year?

A stock is only ""discounted"" if it is considered to be below the market value of the company. We are at the very end of the longest bull market in history and there is ample evidence that economic activity is being heavily affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which could easily lead to a worldwide recession if it continues for more than a few more weeks. I would be very cautious about any claims that you can pick up ""all these discounted stocks"" at a bargain price right now. There are definitely some companies out there which will rebound nicely, but there's no guarantee a recovery will be fast or as broadly based as the last 10 years. There's no substitute for doing your research.

>When the market crash and it begins to rise again, will it be a steady rise or a sharp drastic high increase on the overall market.

No one knows that. Depends entirely on what happens with the economy. It took five years for the DJIA to make new highs after the pre-financial crisis peaks in 2007. It could be shorter this time, or even longer.

>What are your plans for investing into stocks while this coronavirus is going on?

Instead, I would simply invest a set amount regularly so you don’t get stuck at too high of a position if it continues to drop, or miss the gains entirely if it begins to rally. This is a strategy called dollar cost averaging if you want to look it up.

3. Nobody knows. I’d imagine it would be many rally’s that would appear drastic in the moment, but would be a steady increase if you zoom out. But again, nobody knows.

4. My plan is to simply continue to buy and hold. Fortunately, I’ve been putting cash to the side for this exact event (a decline) and now I’m using the dollar cost averaging technique to steadily put that cash into the market and lower my position. 

5. Personally I stick to a simple ETF portfolio, so I’m in no position to give thoughts on the individual stock picks.

The reason why you don't buy the dip is because once momentum shifts downward, you have no idea when it will bottom out. Most people buy the dip and ride their losses close to the ground. It's a foolish way to invest or speculate. You should learn the fundamentals of technical analysis and wait for momentum to reverse to the upside before putting money in.

With  this coronavirus giving all these discounted stocks, would it be wise  to wait it out a bit more or keep an eye on the news and invest  accordingly over this next year? **Indeed, wait for now until Covid-19 cases peak. This virus is a black swan and it will either need to burn itself out (peak/decline) or be successfully contained for the markets to move past it. Until this happens, you will continue to see wild swings with the trend firmly in the decline.** 
3. When  the market crash and it begins to rise again, will it be a steady  rise  or a sharp drastic high increase on the overall market. **Nobody knows this. There are too many variables. Many people seem to think it will be a V shaped recovery but I think they are wrong. We were already late in the business cycle and the Covid-19 outbreak has made the cracks in our economy to get bigger and bigger.**
4. What are your plans for investing into stocks while this coronavirus is going on? **Options speculation, cash, volatility, and bonds. This has been working very well for me. Once we actually bottom out, I'll resume exposure to equities.**

Many stocks are going to get beat down to ridiculous levels, and if you can snatch them up at the bottom, you will do great. But it has to be the actual bottom, If you go be ""all in"" on a dead cat bounce, you will miss it.

Individual stocks can be beat down by as much as 90%, and you will be surprised which ones. The thing to remember is, human nature does not change. People, especially Americans, are obnoxiously stubborn about doing the things they like to do, and they will not change their habits for more than a few weeks.

Here is what Americans (and all people) like to do: drinking out (coffee or alcohol), eating out, sports events, gambling, shopping, vacations. Companies that rely on those habits to make money are going to get beaten to hell for the next few weeks. The ones that survive will recover and bounce back. 

Think about a casino. Suppose the casinos is empty,  payments are due, no money is coming in, and the stock is get hammered. A few weeks later, people start to recover from illness, and they start to feel immortal. They survived, beat the odds, and luck is on their side. Where are they going to go next, now that they are feeling  lucky? Watch the casino stocks. They may keep going down for weeks, and then present a buying opportunity.",9,1584030078,[],,,

\-You have to deposit assets into the margin account. It could be assets and cash that you furnish from either an outside source or a current TDAmeritrade account.

\-The booklet also defines what day trading is.  If the firm determines that you meets its day trading criteria, regardless of the size of the account, you are required to maintain $25k in  assets at the beginning of each trading day.

\-I've never seen a financial firm of any kind switch the type of funds used to settle a trade (margin funds vs. cash). If you borrow money and use it to purchase something, you're using borrowed money.  You only affect the interest that you pay when you use cash to reduce the amount that you borrowed. 

\-The handbook does seem to imply that the margin that you used to purchase assets is tracked to calculate the interest that you pay. So in that sense, the assets that you buy with margin are tracked vs. the assets bought with cash.  The margin is reduced or goes away when the assets bought with the loan are sold.

I've always been able to use unsettled funds to make trades, but the money involved was actual incoming cash not margin.  So in that respect, I've never been charged interest.

In either case, they shouldn't be the ones determining what you do with your money.  Do you due diligence on companies that had healthy balance sheets before this crisis started (ie a lot of cash and low debt), esp if you are looking to start a long position.

t3_fq5a5a,flp80ak,"I think you pretty well nailed it, at least the virus portion.  I told my sister in February to expect conditions like we might have after a nuclear war, but without the radiation.  This does indeed have a long way to go.  But I totally disagree with those who say 'test only those who have symptoms'.  Every single person needs to be tested.  It has already been demonstrated that asymptomatic people can still carry the virus.  Without testing everyone, we'll only prolong the agony.  I am bearish as well, but not nearly as short as I'd like to be.  A bounce on Monday can only be considered as a gift to the bears.  If we get it, I'll load up further.  It will be the most painful money that can be made.  I'd love to have a bullish outlook, but I don't.

But this is far more than a 1-pronged attack.  You touched on it briefly, but for those who don't read between the lines, the 2016 tax cut that allowed major companies to buy back their stock served only to artificially boost an economy that was in absolutely no need of boosting.  We used most if not all of our ammo that could have been used now.  The companies that bought their stock back with our tax dollars would have been better off burning the money. In short, we were due for a major decline, the market was artificially high. The virus simply got the ball rolling.  

In addition to the above (as if that isn't enough) we are full of uncertainty.  I don't know of any factor the market hates more than uncertainty.  We have an administration that when others aren't contradicting them they contradict themselves.  People are looking for leadership almost anywhere but at the top.  They've made some progress, but claims of fake news and casting disparaging remarks on our governors has got to stop.  If we get a sense of certainty, that can only come from solid leadership, we might at least stabilize long enough to catch our breath.

t3_fr8i6s,flun8qf,"I think you are right in your guesstimate on what will happen short to medium run. Ive come to the same conclusion, not so much because of increased debt and job losses (who knows what magic FED and ECB will/can pull of?) but because of human psychology. If we don’t feel “secure” about the future we will halt spending, save more, hunker down, wait it out and stockpile. Its natural and also why we saw the huge rush to liquidity (US Dollars) and all other asset classes falling simultaneously before the FED stepped in with unlimited QE. So i don’t think we will see things return back to normal before we a “relatively” sure that we have the virus under control. 
When i say virus “under control” i DO NOT mean eradicate, found a vaccine nor hitting the inflection point of infected, because by then the stock market will have bottomed out. No instead as investors we need to look for an earlier signal. The best signal i can think of is R0 value falling to around 1.0-1.2 Currently its estimated at 2 and for regular flu is 1.3.
By then we will start to see governments opening up again and bull market start. It will probably be another 1-6 month from that to start see spending slowly return (agree with OP that some sectors will snap back faster than others) because we need make sure that there are no second wave coming and really believe that the future is now once again “secure” and “predictable” :)

Its hard to guess  which sectors will snap back fastest and most, because essentials like pharma and groceries are not susceptible to lower consumer confidence (as much) and then you have some companies spiking now (slack, zoom). I would stay away for travel, airlines and cars because i think these will be slower to recover back to pre crisis levels. Also think thats what spurred the extreme bear rally - a lot of investors saw good quality companies at a 30% discount + FEDs safetynet => buy. But even fed cant fix the demand curve and thats the problem here. Uncertainty about when we are in the clear about the virus (health-side) and lockdows (economic-side), so people wait it out. FED money will keep as many business and families as possible afloat (which is good because otherwise i think we would go to a dark 1929 depression like place) but its not before we see demand pick back up that we can start to forecast company profits. So i think market is currently a bit optimistic on the short to medium effects of this on demand the next 2-9 months, so we will have to go lower. 


Longer term (2-5 years)
I think real estate and stocks as a whole will do fantastic next 2-5 years: ultra low rates + shit ton of liquidity chasing interest => real estate and stock market ON AVERAGE will benefit.

Why is everyone always answering “NO one know what will happen!”. Well - obviously no one knows, but OP is looking for what you THINK will happen.

Either way, vaccine or not, I don’t believe the world will ever be the same. cV has changed the world forever.

Virologists have said a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, but world governments are fast tracking any trials. So, I think they can shave 3-6 months off of initial estimates. So, we’re looking at 6-12 months for a vaccine.

Apparently, there are eight strains of the virus. So, would that vaccine cover all 8 strains? And, would it be 100% effective?

Then, what about production of the vaccine? Do we have enough resources to make it quickly enough? I recall that in recent years there were shortages of flu shot.

With no curtailing in sight for the US and the infected growing exponentially. POTUS saying back to work by Easter... is it out of the realm of possibility that the infected rise to 20 - 40 - 60 million? If it is entirely remotely possible, what happens then?

Is it possible that the people who prepare, deliver, stock our food get sick? Do countries start stockpiling food? (Think Vietnam on rice ATM). When food prices start to increase because of this and S&D.  Is it possible that the less fortunate look for other ways to find food?

If 60M do get sick is it possible that our police officers get sick as well? How about of health worker could they get sick? Who is going to protect and heal us?

What about the Trillions being pumped into the system, is it possible that this could create inflation, is it possible this inflation pushes the fortunate who have saving into worthless savings?

What about inflation during high unemployment could this create stagflation? Does stagflation cripple the economy for a long time?

t3_fr8i6s,flv0tyt,"The optimistic version is that the virus will get under control soon, as it does seem like the lockdowns are working in other countries, so who knows. Look at Italy which is doing terribly because of the late reaction, but has seen a declining rate of infection as of late. 
If politicians, people and companies therefore find ways to uphold strict social distancing and quarantining those at risk (elderly, underlying illness) for a sufficient amount of time, while also being able to effectively track potentially ill people, and quarantine these people quickly to reduce a new spread, over the next year or two. Then we will see a bounce back to almost the same level. 
For companies and people this of course will demands economic sacrifices for the next month or two and some civil liberties regarding tracking sick people. It will be interesting to see if there is a willingness to do so, but overall I do believe in people, so the optimistic version is my best prediction.
In this version, I see most larger S&P500 companies, being able to withstand a massive loss in revenue over say ... two month. And the wealthiest people will not be that hurt, if the market pop back up, and some might even have earned money. Companies and money will therefore still be there, when confidence is returns.
In this scenario luxury items is what I expect will increase the most. Even though consumers of this segment will have less money to spend, it will still be much more than the current expectation that is priced into the stock.

Regarding the next wave of spread. Most likely at that time we will have tests, quarantine procedures, social distancing procedures, as well as the ability to track potentially ill people. I see no reason for any drops in revenue or stock price due to this. If you are to pricing anything into the stock price it would be the additional cost of these new procedures.

The negative version is of course terrible in every way and is not something I will even spectulate about as my belief in people is way to strong. If I at some point start to truly believe that we will not get this under control. I would not invest at all, and pay of debt instead. Otherwise maybe sectors such as pharma, or software.

I'm no epidemiologist, but I know how to use a spreadsheet... You can pretty easily make a mathematical model that's accurate to within 1%, 2 weeks out. I.E. feed it all the data through 3/1, and 3/15's prediction is within 1% of what it actually was. Feed it data through 3/14, and 3/28's prediction is within 1%, etc...

Per my spreadsheet, The case count will peak sharply in the first week of May with something like half the world population sick at the same time, though mostly non-symptomatic. The math gets kinda wild right there at the end, so I don't expect the same 1% accuracy. Also, I expect more wide spread and draconian quarantine measures to prolong things, so we might not see that peak until early June. I highly doubt the peak will be later than that.

Financially, I think the 2T stimulus will keep things on ice and prevent lasting economic deterioration at least that long. Most things will just get switched back on in the 2'nd half of June and resume business as usual. There will be a significant amount of economic shifting as this experience will change a lot of people's life priorities, and therefore spending habits.  A lot of people will have to learn new skills as their old skills will no longer line up with people's new spending habits, so unemployment will be high for a while. If the government recognizes why and pays for college re-education for those who need it, we could be fully recovered economically within 2 years.

The market is forward looking, so it will regain most of it's losses as soon as people realize the world is not ending. I'm expecting that to take place in June as the active case count drops.

As far as the human carnage... Most of us will get this virus at some point. If 5 billion people get it and 2% die from it, that's 100 million people, mostly old or sick people.

First of all, a counter example to your dividend analysis - during dot com, SPX fell from 1500 to 800, while the dividend was pretty much flat, 16.3 to 15.8. So I don't necessarily think that dividend is necessarily a great predictor to price.

In addition, for all the reasons you wrote about the fed and stimulus, my conclusion is that the price action is now so decoupled from the underlying fundamentals, tools like earnings or dividends are no longer useful as prediction tools. 

Now, if you are looking for historical precedence, there are much simpler reasons on why we haven't bottomed:

* Bear markets are typically longer in duration
* Bottoms are typically W shaped, not V
* Bear markets do not bottom during record optimism, they bottom when despair hits max

t3_fzto2a,fn68us1,"Be careful with oil companies. The balance sheets are helpful but hardly will dictate their future performance. So much is tied into expectations of the oil price, and as the last month has shown no one knows what can happen. If it fluctuates up to 100 USD/bbl maybe oil companies will become super profitable... if it hovers around 30 USD/bbl, well these are all bad investments for the longer term. Even with higher oil prices no one knows if investors will flock back to the sector unless these companies bump up returns to shareholders. Hard to judge what long term should be. If in the long term electrification rapidly takes off and demand is crushed - well, there are no long term hopes. If the world fails to meet its climate goals then we might see profitable oil companies - given the global system doesn’t collapse from the serious consequences of climate change.

When it comes to the future... you really need to dig into where their projects are. The reserves remaining. Estimated break even and cash flow prognosis given various oil prices. When it comes to any green energy transition many oil companies are releasing sustainability reports that detail what their plans are and scenarios they’ve modeled for the future energy mix. This is not all easy to analyze if you don’t have a background in any of the individual topics.

As an industry “insider” I would say be very careful. You could analyze all the financials, their future strategy, etc and still get clobbered in the market. Don’t believe anyone’s oil price forecast - they’re almost always wrong. Don’t necessarily blindly follow analysts ratings/opinions - these are the most likely to be completely off. 

To summarize: 

Check out financial statements on their website to 
see how robust the company is.

Read their annual report for information regarding their cash flow neutral breakeven price.

Check out the dividend policy and risk that it gets crimped.

See if they have a sustainability report/prognosis with implications for the business. (XOM is notoriously direct when they say they are not a green energy company and focus on hydrocarbons).

“For anyone wondering about the reserve build they speak to, I'd like to add a couple of points;

•It includes the impact of adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard (CECL /ASC 326).

•Key difference between old GAAP and new GAAP is that you must now estimate the lifetime expected credit loss for your loans adjusted for forecasted conditions. So as of these 3/31 results, the increase in expected credit loss from the current portfolio over its   entire life is $6.8B - to the extent of the capability & accuracy of JPM's model, this is as bad is it gets.

•Day 1 (1/1/20 no COVID) impact goes through retained earnings (i.e. no income statement impact), but subsequent measurement (i.e. 3/31/20 big COVID) goes through income. Hence the massive pop in reserves.

•They're likely using a multi scenario weighted model and would have shifted the weightings to reflect the COVID environment; think something like 80-10-10 of most stressed economic environment:moderate stressed economic environment:baseline

•Subsequent Q's won't see as big an income statement impact as the delta between prior Q provision (officially Allowance for Credit Losses) and current Q provision shouldn't be as vast.

•You effectively had a black swan event for this adoption where 1/1/20 (it's effective date), you wouldn't have weighted a stressed economic environment as heavily (if at all, we nearly had the tip in 30,000 DJI almost as recently as Feb), versus 3/31/20 the remeasurement date where you have to account for, well virtually total cessation of normal economic activity.

So when they speak to building reserves (FASB will have a conniption at that language btw), they've assessed their entire portfolio for lifetime expected credit loss. You see the numbers pop particularly in cards, which are unsecured and your loss given default would to all intents and purposes be 100% vs mortgage loans where you've collateral.

Also important to bear in mind that since ~2018 the bigger lenders have been keeping higher quality mortgage loans on the books (basically they aren't selling top quality 800 FICO stuff to FNMA FMCC much if at all). Those ratings factor into the modeling which leads me to believe that their +$6.8B is pretty accurate.

JPM are very well placed to weather this, as they were in 2008. It's a well run shop under Dimon.

TL;DR: The EPS miss is due to new accounting rules & watch out for any bank who chooses to defer implementation (CARES relief) as it likely means their numbers on the 3/31 run were pretty bad”

One of my favorite tools for fundamental stuff is this [events page](https://www.lazyfa.com/events/) which updates with about 100 new significant SEC fillings each night around 9pm. I've found a ton of under the radar stuff with that but you have to be willing to read a lot!

Edit: throwing in a couple other tools I know of which are (albeit a bit pricier), really f'ing awesome:

- [TradeIdeas](https://www.trade-ideas.com/) (realtime intraday alerts on top gainers/losers, unusual volume spikes, etc)

- [FlowAlgo](https://www.flowalgo.com) (for options flow data)

- [NewsEdge](http://www.acquiremedia.com/products/newsedgev8/) (If you want to see breaking headlines so fast your eyes will bleed from trying to keep up)

- [TC2000](https://www.tc2000.com/) (Charting similar to TradingView, but with more scanners/screener capabilities)

* It is, without hyperbole, **the worst economic data ever collected**
* Staggeringly deeper than the Great Financial Crash
* **National GDP is expected to shrink 7% for the quarter and that is the most optimistic scenario**
* BoE says ""we are not Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic"" because we are choosing to do these things independently.  *OK.  I am convinced!!*
* The world is swimming in oil with no chance of stopping, even more supplies are en-route to the USA right now
* Commodities are down across the board

&#x200B;

Now add the following...

&#x200B;

* All EU nations shut down and are reluctant to reopen which has contained the crisis which is still the worst crisis in 300 years...
* Even after the shut down, Spain etc are plateauing at 400 deaths a day
* The USA is reopening early and the southern states refuse to give up liberty
* Infections are rising 3X faster in the southern states than any other country or territory in the world

Governor here doesn't even have a plan for reopening, what it will include etc. He's frozen in fear.

My thoughts are that we are going to get a spike in visitors once we do reopen.

This is the right way to go for some people. However millenials have instant free access to mountains of data that boomers only dreamed of when they got started. Basically, fund managers and analysts  have been paid in the past to do the research you can do yourself, and they are worried about their industry now. Don't be stupid, actually do your research, but also don't give in to fear. 

A lot of millennials are broke, it's true. However if you run low on cash you can sell stock and have cash in hand in a week or so, max. This is another opportunity that boomers never had when they were coming up. Buffett bought his first stocks and ran his first portfolio through the mail. Yeah like a physical mailbox. It probably took months to get your cash out of stocks back then if you broke your leg or something. Free commissions is another new thing that makes a big difference. Plenty of inertial thinking around that.

There are a lot of legitimate concerns about a bubble. So, don't buy risky stocks that have gone up a lot recently. Buy high quality stocks that are trading well below their highest prices. Buy big ruthless companies that will use this opportunity to crush the competition. In my opinion, this is not a good time to bet on the little guy. The big guy is just going to buy him out or crush him under a mountain of cash  

If any living generation understands that the system is rigged, it's probably millennials. Time after time millennials have gotten screwed by environmental things like high property costs, ridiculous student loans, shitty savings rates, mismanaged markets, crazy medical costs, etc, etc. Yup, it's rigged folks. Your choices are limited and your tools are few. Corporations run our country and you might as well participate. They aren't leaving us with many options. 

It's totally plausible that the current stock market is a setup too. There might be another crash, rigged or not, and people might lose money. However these companies in which you own shares are going to do whatever it takes to get back in the black, or they will die. I'm throwing in with them because most other choices are kind of hopeless. 

It's possible that the markets will work more efficiently if more !informed! people participate. I am basically an optimist and this is my line of thinking. 

Ok, you have a bit of money in the bank and you think it might be a good idea to open a free brokerage account. News stories and haters are making you question your plan. Seems apparent to me that investing your money is a good habit, and now is the least risky time in recent memory. There are stacks of info out there that will help you pick good stocks. Do not take the random advice of inexperienced (ahem) other millennials on Reddit. It's so easy to do your own research.

t3_gjmfmw,fqlq9jp,"You are correct, but the problem is dividend can change at any moment. Many companies stop handing out dividends in uncertain times, so even though it might say that you are getting 10% dividend, you can't  really rely on that. 

An example would be Shell. Pre-coronavirus they were at about 5% dividend, and then after their stock dropped due to the oil crisis it went up to 10%, but only because the stock is cheaper relative to the dividend. However, they recently announced a reduction in dividend, bringing it to about 3-4%, in order to reduce costs.

Be careful when investing in companies that suddenly have crazy high dividend yields. This isn't actually because the yield is so good, but because the stock price dropped an awful lot since the last time they handed out dividend, which is generally not a good sign.",31,1589463989,[],,,
t3_gjmfmw,fqn2cym,"I believe you're misunderstanding a concept of investing, slightly. I might be wrong, and I might be oversimplifying as I'm no expert, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but you need to introduce two concepts to your calculation here. Growth stocks vs. Dividend stocks & that you're still an owner of a share of stock that goes up and down and you can sell, in addition to collecting that dividend.

Dividend stocks are usually mature companies that have good cash flow and profit and they return a portion of that as a dividend because they don't have a better use for it (oversimplification). You can expect that the stock won't grow at a dramatic rate in value, but will still grow... but you're extracting value from dividends simultaneously. 

In a growth stock, you won't get a dividend or your dividend will be low, but this is because the company is growing, using its profits to reinvest in the company and grow. Your return then comes from the increase in stock price. The more successful a company is, the more its growth will slow (you can only go so high) and then they will transition the unusable profits into dividends to compensate investors for the reduced stock price growth.

And with any of these, you can sell the underlying share for its current value. It's just a more complete picture of the situation I hope?",3,1589487502,[],,,

In an economic down turn with the government handing out money, I feel that people will turn to gambling and here is why. I am not referring to the B.S. $1,200 stipend but rather some individuals are now making more money on unemployment than while working. 

With this money combined with boredom, gambling plays into a few emotions. My thoughts are  that people are going to try to turn this money into something more while remaining on unemployment. They cant go get a job or they lose it. There are expectations that a few states will allow sports gambling to make up for lost revenue.

t3_gn4aqv,fr8a0w7,"I too thought it was just another fitness hardware play that wasn't that unique or differentiating until I actually dug deeper into the digital apps/content. That said, adding some information to help clarify what Peloton offers. 

Yes they have the bike and tread, which are their own hardware, but they also have native Digital Apps for nearly every platform (iOS, Android, Fire, etc). With the apps you can use any bike/treadmill to perform any of their bike/running/walking classes. They also have yoga, strength, meditation, boot camp, etc - all come included in the cost of the monthly membership, which is only ~$15. So it becomes a personal trainer in your pocket that can be streamed whenever/wherever you are (with internet). They've even recently begun supporting ""offfline"" workouts if you wanted to do a class outside and not churn through data. 

So overall they have evolved beyond hardware (their original business model) to a fully featured virtual gym that gives you access to new/live content everyday for nearly any type of workout that interests you. All of this accessible through any device that has the app installed. Hard to say if this was their original intent, but they've pivoted nicely and have the advantage of being an early mover. Their content/production is also high quality - starting with the instructors themselves. 

Everything going on with Covid has accelerated growth and adoption (IMO) because people are desperate for a solution - that said it was already best in class and poised to grow with the right marketing/awareness. 

The biggest hurdle they have is the perception of only being a bike/treadmill hardware company - something for their branding/marketing teams to address.

Covered calls

Basically you can sell contracts for the shares you own

LUV say is worth $30

You can sell a contract saying you will sell LUV for $35 until 6/19/2020.

That contract might be worth $50. So the op can sell it at that price

Good outcome LUV stays under $35 by 6/19 and the contract is worthless so you got a free $50.

Also good outcome LUV goes over $35 by 6/19 and now the owner of the contract wants to buy LUV off of your hands for $35. You still profit.

The downside to this? Say if LUV gets acquired or market roars and LUV is at $100. You still have to sell LUV for $35 and that’s what people that buy call contracts are betting on. For the guy that bought the contract for $50. That $50 turned into $6500.

&#x200B;

\----

OP asked how does $50 turn into $6500.

That's because the call option buyer collects the difference 100 x ($100 - $35).

I mean that's a dream case where LUV goes to $100.  Most likely it won't get to $35 or it'll be around there so his $50 investment may or may not turn into a few hundred dollars at most.",4,1590135177,"[['LUV', 8]]",LUV,28.309999465942383,32.81999969482422

Then you've got all the other things they do like solar roof, home battery packs, HVAC, and probably more I'm forgetting.  They are engineering products and technology of the future, it's not hard to see it.

1. Type 1 is the person who went there to actually workout. A lot of them need weights to train, they ain't replacing the gym with anything, especially a $2000+ cardio machine.

2. Older people - now a lot of those I see have plenty of money, but they go to the gym to socialize as well, they hang out with their buddies, I don't see them spending $2000+ on a home cardio machine, cause they know they don't want to work out and won't use it. 

3. Women - lots of women I see do cardio, but they also use weights. Actually generally mostly weights, cardio last. I don't see a lot of them buying a $2000+home cardio machine as well.

Essentially, this argument goes, you can't owe money to yourself. Other more doomsday arguments, say that the whole thing must collapse any day now. The truth is, we don't know. It's not like we have another planet in the future where we can compare ourselves to their world currency inventor and see what ultimately happens to them. The future is not written yet. We may get to a point technologically where everyone owes gazillions to everybody and we all just throw our hands up and say F#%k it, cancel it all and start over. Or only we do that, basically saying, we're never going to pay everyone back their money. Then various bond and treasury holders around the world could try to stage a revolt, but as long as we have the nuclear missiles, that argument is moot.

The interesting question is, will we allow a private corporation like spacex to gain enough power and control over the planet, that the private capital groups who want their money actually go through a private corporation to execute their revolt?

I believe the US move to create a ""space force"" which can enforce the superiority of our currency beyond the atmosphere, is happening precisely so that we can control the chessboard when the time comes. Tesla, for example, could threaten to turn starlink off to select areas,  unless a foreign VIP gets their their capital out.

Super unlikely, but thats how I envision a run on the US treasury looking.

I say super unlikely, because it appears that the companies that intend on controlling the energy and communication infrastructure in the future, are all based in the USA and run by people that believe in the continued dominance of the US dollar. Why do you think Tesla is incorporated in the USA? It's not an accident.

Also, foreign investors make money with their US capital investments. Nobody *really* wants to change that situation too much, making a ""revolt"" *even* less likely.

My company borrowed money and used that money to invest into capital and workers. I use that money to buy goods and services, so there is a LOT of debt floating around in the economy. What will happen to all that fucking debt money if companies can't repay it? Well, the FED will create more dept to buy bonds and save the economy. More depts. More interests. And more inequalities because asset (bond) owners get that money. And it also create (or maintain) inflation in the long run. But inflation work like that:


* First the price of « rich people » assets goes up.


* Then the price of « most things » goes up.


* And finally salaries goes up.

What is happening right now is fucking awesome (from my point of view), we're going to see poverty at the bottom of the earning pyramid like never before and YET, and YET we (Europe, USA) will manage to get inflation instead of deflation. This is really beautiful. The next 5 years are going to be tremendous, especially if Trump is re-elected. Increase in poverty + Inflation + salaries lagging behind inflation. An each time the deflationary cycle will start the FED is going to **P U M P** the economy up, which mean we're going to fall from an even higher place and increase the debt problem. Inflation will eat the debt, but it will rape the bottom of the barrel and all the retards will think only equities are safe and they will pump the market some more making the price unsustainable.

See, instead of investing the money into the company R&D to create new/better things, companies are focus on increasing their value on the market.

I choose to protest by not participating in the current stock market rally. I have no debt and everything I own is paid in full. I know the value of money, so I am considerate where I spend it. I think we do need deflation to happen and people need to realize that leverage must be used wisely and not be taken for granted. Maybe that will stimulate people to be more productive, more creative and more competitive to drive the technological advance further. People are lazy by nature, so if they are not motivated they won't think hard enough. This is from a consumer's point of view.

The current propaganda and civil unrest in cities throughout the country is the worst this great country has ever seen.  The Soros bets have been placed and it is more than clear they are undermining everything in the American economy.   The shorts have loaded the boats last week and sucked in the retail buyer who believed the bottom was in the market on March 23 when the Fed announced trillions worth of market saving life support.   Billions in loans to companies and payments to families were essential life savers and the Bulls put their hand on the scales to tilt in their favor firmly.

Cue the retail buyer.  The coast was clear and the retail buyer sat on the sidelines watching his 401k recover so much that he even decided to add personal money to his retail account in addition to his retirement account.  The psychology of the market moving up nearly every week was just too much for him, just like a bug who is drawn the the light that zaps it’s death, the retail buyer could not deny his temptation to be rich and live the American dream.

So, the short answer is: Nobody knows what's gonna happen.

Most likely, it will lead to massive inflation and a complete lack of confidence in the US stock market once the Fed stops pumping fake money into people's pockets. Unsecured debt relies on creditors' confidence. In case of a national security, that means its people and the rest of the world trading with the US. The US likely won't be able to back its fake money supply with sufficient increases in productivity, so its credibility will be marred and its money will lose value. 

This entire situation is also very likely to lead to war (fascist nations that fail generally try and distract their suffering population by externalizing blame).

This kind of upcoming economic depression is what primarily [drove Germany](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-great-depression) into voting for Nazis and starting to exterminate Jews and start wars against several of its neighbours at the same time. The US has already spent the past decade doing nothing but spam anti-Chinese propaganda nonstop, so their victim is gonna be China.

Not a lot of nice things to be looking forward to.

It's either the collapse of the US economy and decades-long recession for its people that will drag down the entire West and will hand the future to China... or it will be the US regime starting a World War against China.

t3_h0cb1o,ftlhybw,"On Ameritrade you have an ""Activation Price"" and a ""Price"" or a ""Limit Price.""  

The activation price is the price at which the order is placed. The limit price is the price you are willing to sell the stock for. Typically, you want these to be fairly close together. If you are setting a stop limit for a stock with a very high volume (let's say Apple or SPY), then you can set these to within pennies of each other, and your order should be filled.

Example:  Sell $V (Visa): activation price: 180  Price: 179.95  When the price hits $180 or lower, and order will be created to sell the stock at 179.95.  High odds of that order being filled at or higher than that price.

If you are selling a stock that has very low volume, you may need a little more room. So, in your example, you have XYZ company at $300. You want to sell if before it drops below $200, at around that price.

Set your Activation Price at $201 and your Sell Price at $200.  When it hits at or below $201, it triggers the order to sell at $200.

Don't use this for longer than a day, because the stock could gap down overnight and it would not activate; or rather it would activate a sell order, but if it gaps down, the price could be lower than the sell price before markets open and the order would never be filled.

If you think XYZ company stock could gap down overnight, you may want a wider gap.  So, you could set the activation price at $210 and the Sell price at $190. Stocks trading in this price range tend to not gap down as much as penny stocks and a $20 difference is a hell of a spread for a stock in this price range.

If you have a stock trading at $5 and you are worried about it gapping down to $1 over night, you are best off just selling the stock before the market closes, to be honest. You can't really set a stop limit that's going to catch every gap down right where you want it.",3,1591805332,"[['V', 1]]",V,188.75,194.25

When picking stocks, do your due diligence (DD). Read about the company’s products, their financials, any PR, the trends in their stock price, their sensitivity to catalystic events, and so on. And since you’re starting out, pick the companies you believe in! Don’t invest in a random stock you never heard of before until you do your DD. 

And most importantly, don’t invest out of FOMO. For example, don’t invest in $TSLA only because it’s been on a high and crossed $1000 - invest because your DD shows positive outlooks on Tesla’s prospects and financials. Don’t invest in $HTZ because of its rapid growth despite it being a bankrupt company. When you invest, have a solid reason and reasonable price targets. The number of people that don’t do that...

Make sure you read the news frequently and keep up with macro events. Recognize dips and their potential upside, like with airlines, casinos, and healthcare. Don’t forget - stock selection and diversification is the key to a healthy portfolio, after all.

Short term, LUV is a better buy as it has less international exposure, which is subject to quarantine restrictions.

Over the past 6-12 months they have tried to make strategic moves to position them better for business travel, being that a good chunk is booked by a TMC. Yet business travelers love FF miles and WN FF miles don’t transfer like the big guys.

DAL is my favorite of the big three, it is more of a long hold at this point with the international exposure it has. Business travel isn’t going to stop, but budgets have been cut and it may not be back where it was until the end of 2021. Personally, over 70% of us already worked virtually, and colleagues with other companies (Sabre, Amadeus, airlines) did as well. Webex/Zoom are used daily, but we all still traveled extensively, as did the clients we book for, who also worked both in the office/virtually. Sales calls, tech inspections, etc- need to be done in person and a LOT is lost on calls, trust me. But when there’s no budget, there’s no budget. So DAL will take longer to come back I think.

All airlines are adding flights to their schedules starting in July, which is a good sign.

I am less of a fan of AAL and UAL as I think they are at risk for reorg. Just looking at their balance sheets, etc. Not to say the stocks won’t go up and you couldn’t make a few bucks, but the travel stocks I invest in, I do for the long term.

t3_h8mfhs,furxhi6,"> Recent reports speculated that cannabis will be a major key in the future debt crisis and fast tracking legalization is now on the table.

No it won't be. 

I am all for legalization, but we have plenty of examples now and while Cannabis taxes are great, they are not going to be a major component of anything. It's been legal in my state for years now and cannabis taxes represent only a couple percent of state revenue. Revenue growth has slowed as prices have fallen and while it's certainly a net positive, it has not been the major budget boost many thought. 

So while legalization will expand, states and countries can see well enough that it won't be magic. 

I really can't see why I'd want to buy stock in growers or producers. For all it's trendiness cannabis is basically just agriculture. It is easy and cheap to grow and the only thing keeping the bottom from falling out on prices is restrictive licensing. 

I don't really get the sense that most consumers care that much about branding. I probably buy a few ounces a month and I couldn't even tell you the brand of what I am smoking right now without looking at the jar. 

So what exactly is the value of these companies? That they currently happen to hold a little market share in a hyper competitive industry with little in the way of product differentiation? Further legalization is going to decimate their business as existing major players move into the space. Even the biggest cannabis company will be crushed by Big Agriculture. 

Legalization is great and should happen everywhere. I love being able to just walk into a store and buy weed, but I am barely invested in the industry. Only thing I own is a very small stake in a REIT that leases to operators. I might go for distributors if that ever becomes a thing.",344,1592113245,[],,,

But guess what? Almost every time it did the opposite, I was missing out on gains that I could have had which made me just as bad stressful wise.

I'm doing great now. I started buying good companies and started to understand their business and fundamentals. I watched videos on YouTube non-stop. Looked up stuff on Google and investopedia.

The US government has literally just engaged in the most insane market manipulation in modern history. It has demonstrated that reality doesn't matter, the government will pump money into the economy to prop it up.

t3_hbem6t,fv91w3p,"In my opinion, the only aspect of the recent stock market turbulence which HAS NOT made sense with respect to the underlying US economy was the sever price dislocation that occurred from early February to March 23rd.

Stock prices / market caps are supposed to represent the discounted value of all future cash flows, into perpetuity. For a relatively low grade respiratory virus (comparing to prior pandemics), shaving 35% of stock market capitalization was a profoundly emotional reaction that was not based on financial reality. Now, I'm not claiming life won't be changed in some ways permanently, or that 2020 FY's GDP data won't be severe, but the markets forward looking reaction was just insane and not realistic, which many retailer investors realized between 3/16 - 4/1. 

That's the baseline from which we have to approach the effects of the monetary and fiscal interventions that have this far occurred and by all accounts will continue to occur until, at least November 3rd, 2020, of not continuously to 2022 when Powell's term ends.

The market may seem detached from the economy, but it is not. The economy under the current Republican administration was running deficits and lowering interest rates / easing in the face of a hugely strong economy, and now that intervention has been accelerated, with purchasing power of consumers largely unaffected at least for now.

My prediction is that after we see a technically based correction in the range of 12.5 to 17.5% (over 1 to 1.5 months, normally would be longer but everything is speeding up), you are going to see a face melting upward repricing of assets through to 2022 and potentially beyond, depending on the pace of nominal rate increases. Then, either a blown off top culminating in a massive recession / financial collapse, or a period of stagflation, leading to decent political unrest. 

But I just want to say for the record that the current stock market makes 100% sense to folks on the investment industry, it's just happened quicker than they expected / would have liked. And, if you don't believe this, go back to the limit down days and look for predictions for a v shaped recovery, of which there were plenty of predictions.

t3_hbs1br,fvar4iq,"Call options are options that make their $ on the stock being above a certain price, called the strike price.

 Let's say I think AAPL will top $355 before October 16th, 2020. I can buy the AAPL $355 call dated for expiry on October 16th, for a premium of $24.63. (This is a real option contract) Every options contract is worth 100 shares, so to enter the trade I need to put up $2,463. ($24.63x100).  (This is assuming I did it tonight)

To calculate the price Apple needs to hit for you to go breakeven, you take the premium of the option ($24.63) and add it on to AAPL's share price. It's best to do this when the market is closed, because Apple is a very liquid stock. So in my scenario, I would need AAPL to hit $379.63 (share price + premium) to hit breakeven. 

Now, if AAPL does not hit the strike price on October 16th, my option will expire worthless, and I lose the $2,463 you put up. Since you would have theoretically sold me the call, you'd pocket the $2,463, and those are your max profits. 

Now for the put example. Puts are the polar opposite of calls.

Let's say I am bearish on AAPL, and I think it'll fall to $335 or lower before October 16th. (This is also a real option contract.) I can buy the AAPL $335 put option dated for expiry on 10/16/20.

 To enter this trade, I'd have to put up $2,008.00 (premium is currently $20.08, so $20.08x100 = $2,008). Now, here's the difference. Instead of adding the premium to the strike price to determine my breakeven, with puts, I subtract the premium from the strike price to get my breakeven.

 So using the example above, I would need AAPL to fall below $314.92/share to have my put be in the money. $335-$20.08=$314.92.

 Now, let's say AAPL blows up to $375 a share, and October 16th rolls around, and your option expires worthless. You lose the $2,008 you put up to enter the trade. (This is also assuming I make this trade tonight) 

Now, for your example.

>Say I wanted to put down $100 that TSLA was below $1,000 a month from now. First off could I do that, what potantial profit could I get if it was below, and would that be a call or put?

You'd have to find a option that has a $1.00 showing for the price to enter the trade (which would be near impossible to find) Remember, all options are worth 100 shares. ($1.00x100=$100) Your potential profits are capped at Tesla going to $0, and you'd be buying a put. Let's say you bet wrong, and TSLA tops $1050/share by the expiration date you selected. You'd be out $100, because you bet wrong, and that's how much you put up to enter the trade.

If you bet it will go down that’s a put, if you want to bet it’ll go up that’s a call. 

The date on the contract is how much time you have left until expiration and the premium you pay for it is what it cost you obtain that contract.

Each contract is based on 100 shares of stock. 

Contract with a higher chance of the stock price being in the money or past the point at which the contract holds value at expiration are more expensive than contracts with a lower likelihood. 

These contracts have prices in which you can buy  at like Tesla you cannot find an option that has any chance of being worth anything at expiration for $100.

The premium you pay is what you risk, and essentially what you’ll need the stock to do in order to reach your break even point before you even profit.

Check out the options chain on a stock and now you’ll have enough basic info to understand what you’re looking at.

The only put with an average price of $100 expiring next month on Tesla is at $455 strike price 

So for your $100 investment to be worth anything you’d need to have the stock collapse in half

You're allowed to *ask* for (almost) any price you want, but whether or not someone buys it from you at that price is a different story.

In this case, you *could* submit a sell order for $2.49, it just wouldn't get filled - no one would buy it.

&#x200B;

I'm not clear on what you mean by ""Contract goes through...""

Usually, that means ""the order was filled / someone purchased the contract from me at the price I asked for"" but the way you're using it sounds like ""the contract was exercised."" So to answer both your questions:

1. *If* you got filled at $2.49 (you wouldn't, but hypothetically) you would receive $249 in premium, and you would likely be assigned near/on the expiration date (assuming MCC was still trading at less than $2.50)
   1. When you're assigned, you have to buy 100 shares of MCC for $2.50 per share - regardless of the price MCC is trading at
   2. So after you're assigned, you own 100 shares with a cost basis of $0.01 (assuming you sold the contract for $2.49 - which again, wouldn't happen). If MCC is still trading  at $0.76, you could sell those shares for a total profit of $75 (not $249).
2. If you submit a sell order for $2.49 and it *doesn't* go through (meaning it doesn't get filled) then you never sold a contract. You don't get any premium, and you don't have any obligation to buy shares.
3. If the order was filled, but not assigned (this would probably only happen if MCC jumped higher than $2.50), then you'd keep the full premium and not have to buy any shares. This is the best situation when you're selling puts

&#x200B;

*If* you got filled at $2.49, you'd make money as long as MCC was above $0.01 when the contract expired (and didn't drop below $0.01 before you could sell your shares), but you would never get filled at that price.",3,1593584834,[],,,

t3_hll5ga,fwzthmr,"Sounds like your looking for confirmation and you will get it here where people think that the market is some kind of deity that cannot be 'timed' and no other strategy or nuance applies. 

Fact is we are at ath (in terms of valuation vs fundamentals), in a recession (the extent of which is not clear but numbers will come out this month) where states in the US will either have to shoulder an economic burden from shutting down or a healthcare disaster will develop within the next 2-4 weeks. Either way a lump sum investment in the next 2-4 weeks is probably not a good idea. 

However, for most investors (myself included) timing the market is generally a bad idea and the best way to make money is by continuingly investing periodically every month when you are paid for years and years. The investments should be mostly in ETFs spread over the world so you aren't exposed to one economy. You should also mix in a small amount of cash, gold (we're talking 5%, if you want to bet on crypto then a small amount of BTC or another metal may be a good idea if your young but this is polarising and should be left to your discretion), bonds (less bonds when younger, more when reaching retirement). The younger you are the more of your portfolio you can dedicate to hail Marys or more specialized ETFs (ie NASDAQ, single companies or 'picked' stocks). In short, the low variance way to get rich over many years is to constantly invest broadly in a boring portfolio taking into account your age, risk tolerance, job security etc. 

One thought I might add to all of this is that half the people here are part of the genuine DCA crowd, they've done it for years and will continue to do it through the ups and downs. There is another group of 'investors'that have emerged that use the same language as the DCA crowd but are using the same talking points to justify their FOMO. The same thing happened during the BTC bubble where people were saying buy now why does it matter what happens in the short term if you believe the price will be higher in 10 years? Now obviously crypto is different but the psychology is the same. If you go all in on tech today and there is a downturn (which is completely possible) are you willing to buy more as you watch your portfolio drop? A lot of the people who are buying the top can't handle the dips and this is why markets always capitulate at extremes, every time. 

Anyway this turned out to be a ramble but I'm just trying to give a little more of a response than either 'wait for the crash' or 'Cant time the market! Where else can investors put their money!?'

Either way best of luck.",656,1593954107,"[['ATH', 1]]",ATH,30.854999542236328,32.34000015258789

If you're thinking of buying QQQ, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, or AAPL while they're at ATH, that's a FOMO trap.

You're supposed to be selling into optimistic markets (when prices are high) and buying during fearful markets (when prices are low).

FOMO leads to buy high because feelings are strongest when market optimism is brimming and stock prices are surging.

Investors driven by FOMO should never time the market and just dollar cost average because waiting for FOMO to push you into a stock will always lead to buying high.

FOMO, for example, was not poking its head out in March when everything was 50% off.

Lastly, there will always be an opportunity somewhere in the market. I look for irrational movements across all stocks/ETFs that meet certain liquidity thresholds. Lately, I've been writing DDs on some of my favorites.

t3_hll5ga,fx0qvpa,"The answer is variable based on your age, income/current savings, and risk tolerance.  But I'm going to guess you are under 30 w/ less than 10k to invest.

You want to get started investing as early as you can in life.  This gives you the time you need to compound your gains into something you can hopefully one day live off of.  The market ""feels"" expensive now.. given the covid situation and that we are at or near all time highs anyway.  But after the 08 crash the market has felt expensive I'd say ever since 2011-2012.. and if you would have sat out 2012 to present you would have missed out on big gains.  So it's less about trying to time the market, but to have time in the market.

That said it can be pretty emotionally challenging to see your savings drop 30% no matter how much or little you have.  It's the best time to learn from experience though.  If you want to take a more cautious route I'd invest half of your savings in now with a plan to continually add more over time (which you will be doing anyway from working).  If you are more willing to take greater risk just invest now (make sure to be able to save some money to pay your bills though).  You will have a lot of time to keep adding more money in.

   One of and probably the biggest reasons I find myself looking somewhere other than Amazon is they co-mingle their inventory with that of third party sellers and can substitute an item from a third party sellers inventory into your order, if any of those vendors is selling counterfeits it's possible to receive a counterfeit product with your order,( although the chances may be small) I feel like I can no longer trust them to deliver a genuine product 100% of the time.

t3_hpu9uc,fxufpeg,"For short term trading I typically set my stop losses based on support and resistance on the chart. I take sort of a three step approach:

1. Identify support/resistance areas on the chart. Assume that if you're buying at $10, and there's good support a $9.50 and no resistance until $12.00, that means you have $2.00 of upside potential and $0.50 of downside risk, or a 4:1 reward to risk ratio.

2. If my reward to risk ratio is 3:1 or greater, I will enter the trade when I see volume come in. I size the position based on the downside risk and my account size. I tend to never risk more than 1% of my account on any short term trade, since I trade a lot. If you've got a $30k account and $0.50 downside risk, you should buy 600 shares, because 600 * 0.50 = $300 risk, or 1% of your account. Adjust accordingly for your account size and risk tolerance. If you have a smaller account you will need to be much more aggressive to achieve stronger growth. In a small account (< $5k) I would typically risk more like 10-20% of the account on a single trade cause otherwise it will take you years to see any significant growth. This is why it gets easier to make more money as your account size grows. The rich get richer because they can take less risk relative to their portfolio size but make the same gains as someone w/ a smaller account taking a lot more relative risk. Anyway I'm rambling. Here's #3

3. I set my stop loss and targets based on the support and resistance. If the stock drops below $9.50 I cut the trade off for a loss as the pattern on the chart is broken. The loss is already accounted for by my position size relative to the account. The target is $12.00, but I will normally start sizing out on the way there (e.g. sell 1/4 at $11.00, 1/4 more at $11.50 and the rest at $12.00). That's also why I go for a 3:1 or better reward to risk ratio rather than the one most people suggest which is 2:1. At 2:1 reward to risk you can't scale out because your net reward will be lower since you'll never sell everything at the intended target. By being more picky about the reward to risk ratio, I can achieve a better effective reward overall and increase my earnings.

In this example, if the stock pops $4, then you're loss is (3.62-.50)x100) = $312 because the buyer of your covered call will execute the contract, buy 100 shared for .50 and then sell in the open market for $4/share. So in total you lost $212.",2,1594687667,[],,,
t3_hqr91s,fxznncw,"No, it's not like that.

If you sell a covered covered call at strike 0.5$ it would expire worthless only if the stock dropped below 0.5$. As long as it is above 0.5$ the buyer can profit by exercising his/her right to buy your shares at a price of 0.5$. In short, you are giving your shares away at this price. And note the option can be exercised at any time before expiration, too.

However that sweet premium does include the difference between 0.5$ and the current share price (this is the intrinsic value of the option : (2.26$-0.5$)*100 = 176$)
Noone in their right mind should want to sell this option for less than that amount as the buyer could immediately exercise and sell the shares for a profit.

Your scenarios if you sell this option:

1. The share price increases : you are forfeiting the gains to the buyer. You collect 173+50 = 223$ for a total loss of 139$ (+ fees)

2. The share price decreases but not below 2.23$ : you still collect 223$ for a total loss of 139$, you would be better off not selling the call as your shares would be worth more.

3. The share price decreases below 2.23$ but not below 0.5$
You still collect 223$ for a total loss of 139$. You reduced your loss which would be larger if you just held the shares. The buyer took some of that loss since his/her option lost value.

4. The share prices drops below 0.5$
You collect 173$ and keep your shares, now worth between 0 and 50$, for a total loss between 139$ - 189$

And this is assuming the option is not exercised before maturity.

Remember when you sell an option you want that option to lose value. But in the case of a covered call, you are long the shares so you don't want the shares lose value either. The only way to have both is for the option to lose time value (theta decay) by not reaching the strike through expiration.",2,1594688563,[],,,

Since they are a dividend king, JNJ is very likely to do what it takes to protect the dividend.

I YOLO'd some eyebrow raising trades that did very well during the market collapse, and my portfolio grows today.   Most people here just ride you for the schadenfreude which is not cool IMHO.  Here's my considered advice.  Forget P/E ratios and moving averages.  All the maths was great once upon a time.  Do you know what is really good at math?  Computers.  Your math will NEVER beat the computers doing math and executing trades.  But you are living and working and struggling in the mass of consumers that drive the market and you can use a little social engineering to your advantage.  The world is changing.  Spending habits are changing.  You can't make money on the businesses that already sell a lot.  You can only make money on a business that will sell more tomorrow than they do today.

Fill in the blanks:  I believe <business> is going to replace <competing business> in the long run because <reasons>.  We see this today in the form of <personal experiences> which I believe to be a trend that will last because <reasons>.  This stock is a good short term buy because <it went down / I'll wait for it to go down some>.  This stock is a good mid / long term buy because <reasons consumer demand will improve> and <reasons consumers can afford it>.

Don't give up on the maths.  You still need to consider if a stock is overpriced / overbought.  Make smaller bets.  5 years ago you couldn't do this because trades were $10 each.  It would cost you $20 to buy, then sell a stock.  Today, trades are free.  Buy a little.  If it's working for you, buy a little more.  This is such a luxury to have.  Use it to your advantage.

Now think of some businesses:  computers (be more specific), Oil (be more specific), retail (be more specific), energy (I love this sector), crypto currency (waste of time), cars (the easiest of them all, my god, the writing is on the wall here), entertainment (warning: volatility), pharma (worse than entertainment)... and apply a business in this sector to my fill in the blank exercise above.  If you have a job, you probably work in one of these sectors.  If true, then you have powerful insight into consumer habits in that sector.  Use that.",16,1595539440,[],,,

I don't know what prices you bought Tesla and Netflix at but I'm sure those weren't at a discount either, because any time in the past month has not been a discount. If you read the Intelligent Investor, you should have learned that day- and swing-trading only benefits your broker off of commission, and you're more likely to lose to the market than to win from it if you play that way. 

The sure-fire way to learn from the stock market is to invest long-term. Not for a few weeks, but for *years*. Treat buying a stock like taking ownership of a company. Place yourself in the position of someone with enough money to buy 51% of a company's stock and think ""would I do this?"" If you want to be a good investor, treat owning stock like owning the company itself. 

Until you've got the basics down, I wouldn't touch swing- or day-trading with a ten foot pole. Without doing proper due diligence, playing that game is a road to frustration and potential loss. I would say focus on honing in your research skills and understanding how to read a 10k, how to utilize tools like Morningstaror Fastgraphs, and how to properly valuate a company to a level where you never again say the words ""I bought Apple at $386 at a discount.""

t3_hwkond,fz0t31q,"It sounds like you know a lot of useful tools for investment decisions. However, based on the short descriptions of your investment process, you end up using only a small selection of those when doing the actual decision. When having multiple tools for investment decisions the approach should be more mechanical, or you end up telling a story you like with the tools you select.

So I recommend that you select 4 to10 indicators  with different viewpoints. When doing your research for a stock give them a score from 1 to 5, and combine those scores by averaging them. That way you get a score that is not based on cherry picking but is more balanced, and it makes your decision process faster also. You can improve your decisions easily by seeing which indicators have not correlated with success so well.

Find your own set of indicators, but some good ones can be:

* Chart patterns
* Technical indicators
* Fundamentals
* Quality of leadership
* Insider / institutional ownership (buying/selling?)
* Growth potential (compared to market cap)
* Affecting trends
* Quality of catalysts

Try not to rate the company, but the stock! So make the criteria so that you do not end up buying high-quality firms but overpriced stocks.

Avoid day trades. On short-term price action is there to suck money out of inexperienced traders, and does not reflect fundamentals so well. With fewer trades you lose less to transaction costs and have more time to make sound decisions.

And about oscillators: many of them are designed for trading in a range, so when using those make sure that the stock is not trending!

I left my job in 2013 to trade full time and did really well, and by like 2016-2017 I was so damn lazy cause all I did was wake up and trade for a couple hours and make my money and then watch Netflix all day lol. Occasionally I'd have a bad day and the market would really humble me and then I'd go into a depressive state for a few days and be a bum until I felt like I got it outta my system and then it was right back to it. It was hard for me cause I wanted to hit up friends and stuff but when you are done trading at 11am all your friends are still at work so I would just fill my time with laziness. Watching TV, browsing reddit, mindlessly cycling between email/facebook/twitter/checking the market/reddit/eat/repeat. It also caused me a lot of losses too cause I would get so bored I'd go back to the market during the shittiest time like the lunch hour and trade just to cure my boredom, and when I did that I would always lose. I even play a couple instruments and would do that to kill time but you can only cycle between your office/studio/living room/kitchen so many times before you start to go insane. 

It's a weird thing because the reason everyone dreams of quitting their job and making their own living is so they can do whatever they want, and we have all these grand plans for the things we're gonna do when we're ""free"" but then when we get there, we are lazy as fuck! 

What I ended up doing was turning a side project I had been working on for a while into a subscription website. I was a tech dude before I left my job so I had some coding skill, and had been messing w/ Python to do stuff like scraping financial info off various websites and had a bunch of scripts written but no way to manage them, so I started learning Django and built a website to manage them all and when I got it polished up I decided it was worth setting up a payment system and seeing if I could get some side income from it. In the process of building it I also inadvertently became really good at Django and Python, got a mentoring gig on the side helping students learn software development and eventually started writing content for that company for their courses they sold and used that money to fund growing my subscription site. I also started volunteering at a local animal shelter and went and walked and socialized dogs which helped a lot. These days I'm almost completely independent from trading thanks to my software dev work on the side, my subscription site, and then trading to pay the bills, but if I stopped trading entirely I could still survive and I'm working on growing my sub site to the point it will be able to support me with recurring revs on its own. I guess my point is, you're doing well w/ trading but don't write off expanding into other things.

Watching the flip between the two stock prices today felt odd, and maybe that is just my inexperience in this talking, but it looked like an overreaction in an already odd and volatile market. 

Intel over preformed expectation in its Q2, a delay was announced, and somehow it dropped momentarily to <$5 above its COVID crash? Even my most pessimistic thoughts about it being the old king wavering on its throne doesn't give the uncertainty or panic of COVID. So that looked odd to say the least.

And there are currently a-lot of old oil tankers and not that many orders for new oil tankers. Historically low amount of orders for ships and historically high age of ships. So if demand goes up it will take an average of 2 years before ships are ordered and delivered. And supply can go up.

t3_i1d078,fzxkw9h,"My opinion is that Boeing was overpriced before covid.  There were warning signs that were being ignored and the stock was spiraling. Boeing  has been having issues for a couple years now.  They just had their  first loss in a quarter (Q4 2019) since 1997.  They have fallen behind  Airbus.  Their 737 Max STILL is grounded.  Delta is retiring their fleet  of 777 for....Airbus.

Boeing annual revenue for 2017 was **$94.005B**, a **0.54% increase** from 2016. Boeing annual revenue for 2018 was **$101.127B**, a **7.58% increase** from 2017.  Boeing annual revenue for 2019 was **$76.559B**, a **24.29% decline** from 2018.  Boeing revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2020 was **$70.550B**, a **29.91% decline** year-over-year.

Boeing revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 was **$16.908B**, a **26.22% decline** year-over-year.

**An Overview of Boeing’s Revenues**

Boeing’s 4 divisions are expected to make $92.3 Billion for the full year of 2019.

1. Commercial Airplanes: $45.6 Billion (49%)
2. Defense, Space & Security Systems: $27.4 Billion (30%)
3. Global Services: $19.0 Billion (21%)
4. Boeing Capital Corporation: $ 0.3 Billion (<1%)

In terms of Customer, Boeing’s Expected Revenues of $92.3 Bil in 2019 can be divided into 2 categories:

1. US government – $28.6 Bil (31%)
2. Others – $63.7 Bil (69%)

Are you aware of their refueling tanker that can't...refuel?

**Vital contract runs into trouble**

The   KC-46 is the Air Force's next-generation fuel tanker aircraft,  designed  to replace a rapidly aging aerial tanker fleet. Boeing has  been  contracted to produce 179 KC-46 tankers. Valued at $32 billion,  this is  Boeing's single largest military program.

The   Air Force is already buying about a dozen KC-46 per year, with   deliveries expected to continue for the rest of the decade.   Unfortunately, the program has run into a serious problem. The tanker's  remote vision system (RVS) has proven to be deficient. Air Force  Magazine has explained the scale of the problem:

""RVS   is supposed to let Airmen see where the plane's refueling boom is in   relation to an aircraft it is trying to gas up. But at around 10 feet   from the receiver aircraft, the RVS doesn't focus well enough to   connect, sometimes causing the operator to hit the nearby   plane...Without an RVS fix in place, Airmen would not only deal with   blurry vision but also issues like a blinding glare off of the receiver   airplane on clear, sunny days.""

**Pushing ahead in spite of vision problems**

Despite the obvious problems facing the KC-46, the Air Force opted to move ahead with its procurement plan.

In   Jan. 2019, Boeing delivered the first batch of KC-46 aircraft to the   Air Force, two years behind schedule. At the time, the Air Force lauded  the KC-46 deliveries  as a ""major milestone for our next generation  tanker."" The service  claimed that the continued design issues,  including the deficient RVS,  would ""not prevent the tanker from  carrying out its primary mission.""  Indeed, the Air Force was quite  insistent that Boeing would solve the  issues expeditiously:

""We   have identified, and Boeing has agreed to fix at its expense,   deficiencies discovered in developmental testing of the remote vision   system. The Air Force has mechanisms in place to ensure Boeing meets its   contractual obligations while we continue with initial operational   testing and evaluation.""

Until Boeing resolves the RVS issues, the Air Force has withheld about 20% of the value of each plane delivered.

**Grounded by the top brass**

The   KC-46 is supposed to be ready for operations in 2023 or 2024, but the   top military brass is not yet prepared to clear it for regular service.   The Air Force certainly sounds less confident than it did back in   January of last year.

On  March 3,  Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein told a Senate   committee that, until all technical issues are resolved, the KC-46 would   only fly in the event of a serious geopolitical conflict.

They have more leash because they have military contracts and that gives them more leeway to screw up.

If  you look at defense contracts, Boeing isn't that far ahead of the 3rd,  4th, or 5th contractor.  Lockheed is safe due to that stupid F-35  fiasco.

Lockheed Martin: 44.9 billion

Boeing: 26.9 billion

Raytheon: 23.8 billion

Northrop Grumman: 22.3 billion

General Dynamics: 19.4 billion

To  think that Boeing is somehow guaranteed to go back to those highs, you  are being overly optimistic. Boeing didn't go over $200 a share until  July, 2017.  $300 a share in December, 2017.  $400 a share in February  2019.  This is with revenue going down.  I don't see why it is  automatically going back to all-time highs.  One final point:

* Boeing net income for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 was **$-0.628B**, a **129.25% decline** year-over-year.
* Boeing net income for the twelve months ending March 31, 2020 was **$-3.411B**, a **133.69% decline** year-over-year.
* ***Boeing annual net income for 2019 was*** ***$-0.636B***\*\*\*, a\*\*\* ***106.08% decline*** ***from 2018.***
* Boeing annual net income for 2018 was **$10.453B**, a **23.67% increase** from 2017.
* Boeing annual net income for 2017 was **$8.452B**, a **68% increase** from 2016.

I see Boeing spending 2021 making fixes, and start to be on the up in 2022.  There was so much irrational exuberance over them because their stock was low and everyone just said, ""It is covid! They are a defense contractor! They are pure money!"", and people didn't look at them BEFORE covid.",4,1596238952,[],,,

t3_i1d078,fzwgepe,"That's a $340 loss on a stock you invested $1,920 in approximately.

Honestly, I see two things with Boeing which its up to you to agree or disagree on.  
In aviation, it's not like there is an abundance of airline manufacturers at this moment. So I see the federal government doing what it has to in order to save the company. Perhaps they nationalize airline manufacturing and aviation? But Boeing will not vanish from the face of the earth. From a long term perspective I see it still here in 30+ years.

The second thing is what will happen to the Boeing we know. In no uncertain terms, travel will never be the same. People who believed we were slated for a V-shaped recovery were lunatics. Unfortunately for companies like Boeing, Royal Caribbean, American Airlines, Etc, that means business will be much different in the next 5-years than it was before.

Is it going north of $200 shares any time soon? The answer to that is what day will a COVID-19 vaccine be given the green light.

That’s exactly what I thought when I bought a few shares as a part of my small portfolio. I sold a couple days ago, dumped for more AMD, and that’s worked out really well. 

There’s a few things that caused me to do this.

1. AMD still hasn’t announced their new CPU or even GPU lineup this fall. They’ve said “Zen 3 is coming” etc, but they really haven’t said much else. Just look what happened when they announced their latest chips, that’s what like 5% of their overall sales potential? If that???

2. Intel just released a new line of processors. They are fresh and are barely competing with AMD’s latest line, Zen 2. Fact of the matter, intel is holding on to their fan base for the time being, but soon, AMD is going to take that over. Intel will have NO option but to lower their price, which will lower their value even more.

3. AMD is projected to receive between 30% and 50% of market share in certain fields within the next 2-3 years. They’re currently at 5%. To put that in perspective, Intel will just be spitting out 7nm processors when AMD is on Zen5. 

4. AMD is supplying XBOX and PS5 with their two most expensive components; even at a measly $300 for those combos, which could be undervalued, and estimated 100 million consoles sold over the next 3 years on the light side, is 30 billion dollars. Almost a third of their total value right now. There’s no way this is priced in yet.

t3_i4e68c,g0j87dv,"10nm is built on quad patterning lithography. Intel chose this route as opposed to EUV, which TSMC chose (incidentally, Intel are trying to use EUV on their own 7nm, which should show you which decision was right). The structure of quad patterning means that it is inherently prone to lower yields. When you combine this with the monolithic structure of Intel's CPUs, it will be impossible for them to produce high core-count chips (i.e. server/TOTL desktop) in any volume with the margins that they've seen historically. No amount of +++++++ will change this fact. I said two years ago that 10nm would be a complete writeoff and I stand by that today.

Your point about IP is very valid. In my models I forecast that AMD will have very little share in the datacentre GPUs (but AMD has their own raytracing implementation coming out with the new consoles; which imo will be more efficient than Nvidia's due to Microsoft writing DXR with AMD's hardware in mind), but their IP helps out massively in the CPU arena. It'll be very difficult for Intel to build a competitor to chiplets without infringing on patents - which is the only way 10nm could be viable.

As for taking people at face value:

[https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017](https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017)

Intel have announced delays to 10nm by 'a year' for every year since 2016. I don't see anything that would suggest 7nm is anything different.

[https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporary](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporary)

TSMC views Intel and AMD completely differently. It's very much in their favour to help AMD out as much as possible with wafer supply, and limit Intel's own production. AMD's long term success ensures growth for TSMC; while Intel's long term success would mean they reclaim the process crown and constrict TSMC's market share.

&#x200B;

I agree that AMD is highly priced right now - they're above my valuation for the first time ever, while Intel is slightly underpriced. However, in the past few years AMD have consistently executed on their roadmaps, increasing their value while Intel has constantly screwed up, decreasing theirs. It's very possible that you buy into Intel now, while its' price> value, but then value decreases as they continue to fail and your price is never realised.

TLDR: The big picture is that 10nm is a total writeoff, and 7nm is looking pretty shoddy as well. They bit off more than they could chew trying to get GaaFets to work. Intel's dominance and past price has been built on its process lead, and losing that lead and having to go to TSMC who will treat them poorly justifies a large drop in price.

""371 million people had diabetes globally in 2012… By 2030, they expect 552 million people will have the disease.""  

This isn't relevant. Do you know why? Because hypoglycemia is only an issue in Type 1 patients. In the US, there are only 1.25 million Type 1 patients. Extrapolating that \~5% of total diabetes diagnoses to the rest of the world, you would need to divide your numbers by 20 to get your true patient population.

More so, this isn't a re-occurring purchase for the patients that do end up buying one. Most type 1's will eat a snack well before they get into an emergency situation even requiring this device. It may be purchased once by a small percentage of these individuals, but will most likely be purchased for emergency responders. And even then, will the company be able be able to break into the market vs. the big established dogs? Maybe, maybe not.

t3_i7t2d4,g13wrxg,"Hey, nice post - just a couple things I'd like to point out!

1. Depending on your broker you can also send a limit on open order, or set a buy stop limit for a price you know the stock will open *above* with a limit at the highest price you are willing to pay regardless of the open price. My point here is that just using a simple limit order is tedious and annoying cause you have to keep watching the news and adjusting your order. You could eliminate this by using a limit on open, buy stop limit or if you're really confident, market/buy stop market on open. 

2. In general, this is a risky strategy. You really have no idea what the stock is going to do right out of the gate, and it's much more practical unless you plan on swing trading it and holding it for a while to wait 10-15 minutes after the open of trading on it and make a decision based on a 1 min or 3 min chart. this way you let all the crazies gamble for a few minutes and do 10-15 minutes of price discovery before buying, so you're not going in totally blind...you've got some history to use as a measure of where to set your stop loss and targets and so on.",14,1597158946,[],,,

The problem also is that a lot of financial regulation deals with intent, and intent is harder to prove with some of these more nebulous issues.

In some cases if it’s blatant, and irrefutable, they will go after the person regardless (especially if “average” people were hurt), but often it is difficult to prove the case, or they will fine them a negligible amount.

t3_i8psb3,g1a6tzw,If you invest 200$ every month for 20 years and lose everything you won’t pay any taxes.,7,1597283264,[],,,
t3_i8psb3,g1agoo6,"240 payments of $200 is $48,000. At 5% annual rate, it should end at $82,550. If we assume 7% growth, you are just shy of $104,800. If you want to go higher, at 10% growth, that will end at a whopping $153,140. 

I am sticking with the 7% figure for the rest of this:

Assuming you held until the end of the 20th year, you would owe tax on the long term capital gain on the first 19 years, so roughly $102,300-45,600=56,700 at the LTCG rates of 15% (unless you are in a higher bracket by then, then it is 20%)

And tax on the last year of short term capital gains of the last year ($2,493-$2,400=$93) at your ordinary tax rate. 

The break out of long and short is over simplified for this example. Assuming you are in the middle bracket (24%) and that STCG is assumed taxed fully at that rate, and nothing else considered. Tax bill would be $8,505 on the LTCG and like $22 on the STCG, for total bill of $8,527. Even at the highest rates (20/37) you’re only looking at a bill of only $11,375. 

You can look up the brackets and play with the numbers more. The gains are the same, just depends on the rates. 

Another thing to consider, are these indexes paying dividends? 

Sticking with the monthly values of the 7% growth scenario for simplicity. The average S&P500 stock has a div yield of 2.5%. Going off those assumptions, we get increasingly large 1099-DIVs each year. You can run the calc yourself but it grows exponentially, here’s some highlights:

Year 1: $34
Year 5: $346
Year 10: $960
Year 15: $1,970
Year 20: $3,632

Total dividends over the years: $26,504. 

Since you are holding all for long-term, and simplicity, assume qualified dividend rates of 15/20%. Again, you can run the full calc but unless you are in the top bracket, you’d pay 15% each year on those dividends for a grand total of $3,976 in tax spread over 20 years. Give or take. 

I do not claim to be an expert, I do work with taxes and am a CPA, but I do not know your other income/deductions. This should be relatively accurate but was mainly done for fun since there are too many assumptions involved to be considered an accurate prediction. I would suggest seeing a financial advisor who could help you get a more accurate plan for your specific situation.

t3_i9uxq9,g1mv2t3,"I'm not an expert but have been studying/practicing trading for 4-ish years. What I can tell you though is the first thing you should do is a general google search, something like ""stock trading for beginners,"" ""trading mistakes to avoid,"" things like that. Then, google/watch videos on the different *styles* of trading, like long term investing, swing trading, and day trading. Get a feel for what will suit your personality **and** life circumstances the best. Then start putting learnings into practice on a paper trading (demo) account until you're comfortable with how to buy and sell, what the order types do, and the interworkings of everything. Tradingview has a simple one that doesn't require you to sign up for a brokerage. Youtube will help you navigate it if you get confused.

After a while of doing research, you'll start gravitating towards a type of trading style and certain people whose minds you jive with. Then you can see if they have a youtube channel/blog/twitter and learn more in depth. At first you'll be overwhelmed by all the opposing opinions and services out there, but just keep going and look at what's actually working today. As Paul Singh says, a lot of old fashioned trading books/resources are now outdated because the market's behavior changes as time goes on. Things that worked even in 2008 might not work as well now.

If you like podcasts, I definitely recommend chat with traders. That's what got me interested in stocks and helped me find what direction I really wanted to go. It gives you a peak into different traders' styles but also educates you.

Important tip: when you start trading with real money, never put more into stocks **total** than you'd be willing to lose. If you put $1,000 in and lost it all, would you lose sleep?

t3_iajxiz,g1p8wca,"I haven't read this in detail yet, but the first item explains something significant. This isn't a secondary offering or a shelf registration. It's a proposed increase to the **authorized** share count. 

If the company has already issued all of their authorized stock in the form of outstanding shares, they can't actually register or offer any additional shares until more are authorized. For example, say a company has 500 million shares authorized. In their IPO, they offer 100 million shares, turning 100 million into outstanding shares. The other 400 million sit on the shelf, and if they need to raise more capital, they can register and sell another 50 million, 100 million, whatever, until all the **authorized** shares have been issued and are outstanding.

If that's still not enough, then they need to file the form that this company has filed, which allows them to amend their articles of incorporation to authorize more shares. Those shares could be used to do additional offerings or they could be used as part of a merger, attached to warrants or convertible debt and so on. 

The fact that they are requesting to authorize more shares is not necessarily a red flag or anything negative on its own. The more important question is whether or not the company is habitually dilutive to the point that they have ""used up"" all their authorized shares by doing secondary offerings and now they need to authorize more, or if there's a good reason for more shares to be authorized. The form should give more detail about why they need to do this and what their plan is but like I said I haven't read it in detail yet. One other thing you might want to look at is any outstanding debt they may have coming due in the near future and how much cash they have.

For example, $AAPL Apple has had returns of over 100% this year. $tsla Tesla has had 390% gains. $AMD has see huge gains and was the largest winner percent wise last year. It traded last year for around $35 a share and now around $83. Remember buying a cheaper stock too obtain more shares is a bad strategy. 1 share of a company that has returns of 30% is better then owning 10 shares of a company that only returns 5% all things be equal if investing ~500. Sometimes you can’t buy 1 share because it costs too much. Take $AMZN for example or $TSLA. So you could see if your broker offers fractional shares as a service. If not you have several options. You could invest in a quality stock while you accumulate the cash to buy a higher price stock you have researched and expect to go up. Another opportunity would be to invest in options via simple calls. Options allow you too leverage a smaller amount of cash to control the right not obligation to buy shares at a future date. For example, if you think $AMZN will continue to increase in price you can buy a call option 3-4 months from now with a higher strike price or price you think it could be at. 1 contract controls 100 shares. If $AMZN rises the value of your option also rises. You can then sell it back. You will want too research this strategy and make sure you understand it before doing it. 
If you are just looking for returns and do not want to invest the time building a diversified portfolio then buying a ETF that represents segments of the overall market is your best bet. I would buy $QQQ which is the Nasdaq 100 . Technology stocks have performed the best in the last 10 years and I believe will continue fir a long time.

Why is Coinbase doing an IPO?

So why does Coinbase need more funding right now of all times?

Coinbase itself doesn't develop any cryptos, their profit margins come through increasing their volume of exchange.

Are they going to spend this funding on acquiring rival exchanges like Kraken or Bitfinex?

If it's for you, then great.  Pursue it and make money and I respect you for that.  EDIT:  You can also flip houses but that's not for me either.

So while there's other less common investments, stocks are the only game in town for me.  I think a lot of people are like me and I think there's more investors than ever with Robinhood and partial shares so I think stocks deserve a higher multiple than ever. 

So what else am I going to do?

If you never invest at all time high, you're basically never investing in it.  You would have spent from 2011 to 2020 waiting, still bought at a higher price AND lost out on any dividends.  Inflation alone drives the market to higher prices.  EDIT:  not necessarily all time highs like I said but when the market is up, people get scared and the market went up that whole time.

Also, if stocks run up 10% and then crash 20%, you didn't lose as much as it sounds.  And if stocks crash, usually other assets are hurting too so it's not like you chose a loser.  Those stocks will also recover so what are we talking about?

Regarding a potential crash, I don't understand the fear.  A boat in the harbor is safe but you don't build boats to leave them in the harbor (I slaughtered that quote lol).  I'm not investing money I need to live and at 35, I can survive a crash.

I think people get too caught in fear and these high level ideas when sometimes you just need to look at the thing in front of your face and go for it.  I don't think my answer is the only answer because investing is different for everyone but I don't understand constant fear.",45,1598528857,[],,,

t3_ikpu4w,g3njyk4,"Seems like quite the battle. Walmart has old infrastructure (brick and mortar), and Amazon started later so they probably have more tech framework.

For example, Walmart doesn't seem to have extremely-fast dropshipping, so I hypothesize their online order to warehouse to shipping sequence is inferior to Amazons. I would further that conversation by asking, who do we think will be able to implement drone-based shipping sooner?

However, it is a strength of sorts for Walmart to have stores in many if not most cities. I would test this strength by considering two main types of online purchases: common items such as Crest toothpaste, and esoteric items such as a 0.25"" derma-roller. Basically order an item that would exist locally in a Walmart store and one that wouldn't from their online store, and perform the same test at Amazon. Test which ones consistently ship faster. This should reveal some unseen infrastructure coefficients.

As an extension of that common vs. esoteric item test, an aggregate analysis is due for probing the implications of ordering online + shipping and ordering online + in-store pickup. Walmart crushes in this regard, but Amazon could potentially add store fronts in their warehouses and/or shipping facilities, so it will be important to track that if you maintain that Walmart has a comparative advantage.

As a Canadian, I find one drawback for Amazon is that, if an item ships from China, it's game over. It will take 2+ weeks, sometimes upwards of 2 months to arrive. Walmart doesn't seem to be as interested in these esoteric, low footprint items such as PCIe to 4 USB peripheral hardware for a computer.

In addition to this difference between common and esoteric items for Amazon and Walmart, I find that Amazon's reputation seems to be worse today because, as a company, they seem to be orders of magnitude more sociopathic than Walmart in the ways they treat employees as time-tracked cattle and have issues with lacking intent for cleaning up bot-riddled fake reviews and counterfeit/low-grade third world companies. Amazon is a network of third party sellers. Walmart is one seller that acquires products and then sells them.

I would ask the question, what will the future bifurcation be between frequency of online purchases vs. in-store purchases? If Amazon can use their current infrastructure as item pickup touchpoints, that brings Amazon pretty analogous to Walmart in terms of physical location saturation (and related logic). Shipping velocity strikes me as the most important attribute. In my opinion, that seems to be a critical factor in quantity of demand, more so than brand reputation. Both companies have significant economies of scale. Walmart seems less infested with both endogenous and exogenous dark triad vectors.

And of course, make sure a person studies ""dark shopping cart patterns"": [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf) Both Amazon and Walmart seem to heavily deploy those grey area ethics techniques. At the moment, whoever is using more of those is probably capable of harnessing more sales if traffic is in a 1:1 ratio.

Also don't forget Nike's recent movement to push transactions from external sources to their domain. This is significant, in my opinion, because it implies potential aggregate movement from centralization to decentralization. It begs the question, what other brands might try this, and who exactly is going to handle shipping when shipping velocity composed with total cost is among the primary concerns. Maybe we will see more aggregator websites with outbound links to shopping carts? I wouldn't want to assert much specifics here in the way of solutions, but an Occam's Razor will be converged upon via regression to the mean as free market mutations iterate from here, now.

Also don't forget that Walmart's market cap is $417 Bil, and Amazon's market cap is $1.75 Tril. That's a difference by a factor of 3, almost 4. Amazon also owns data via AWS that relates to transactions on all websites and servers using their database stores, etc. In some ways, the limit of Amazons comparative advantage approaches disgustingly-great as the amount of compared metrics approaches infinity.",7,1599001475,"[['USB', 1]]",USB,36.5099983215332,37.08000183105469

t3_inzipt,g4c0e3a,"Golden Nugget Online Gaming is still trading at a great value since it is still a SPAC and most 
people are not aware of it yet, but it should start getting a lot more publicity within the next month when it officially changes to Golden Nugget Online Gaming. Given that it is still a SPAC, Reddit won't allow me to post its current ticker, but it starts with a ""L"" then a ""C"" then finally an ""A"".

It is an online gambling company like DraftKings except Golden Nugget Online Gaming puts their biggest focus on iGaming while sports is secondary whereas DraftKings is the reverse; iGaming is more profitable than sports gaming and more pandemic proof. DraftKing's price doubled in just a little over a month after it similarly went public via a SPAC earlier this year and I'm expecting a similar result from Golden Nugget Online Gaming.

But the best part is that unlike DraftKings, Golden Nugget Online Gaming is actually already a proven profitable company and has been profitable for the past four years despite being around less time than DraftKings. And they have won top operator award for the industry 3 years in a row. Their Average Net Revenue per user blows DraftKings out of the water as well.

And as of now, they are still just in one state which they are the market leader in, so they still have 49 more states to grow into as more and more states legalize online gambling. They will be going into Michigan soon.",3,1599488389,[],,,

This is a really important point. Too many people just buy (or sell) options on a stock they have a directional opinion on without thinking about the risk/reward ratio. One of the primary reasons I stick to option spreads rather than naked options is that it's so much easier to quantify risk/reward.

I've made it a point to never do a spread when there's an ex-div date or an earnings announcement during the life of the spread.

Also, the best bid/ask spreads are on high volume ETFs, especially SPY.

I wrote a program that scrapes the entire option chain for any equity I'm interested in, and calculates all the profits, losses, and probable moves for every possible spread that could be constructed. Yeah, for an ETF like SPY there could be many thousands, but it doesn't take more than a couple of seconds.

I also scrape the stock history, and boot-strap it to get probabilities for any move.

Then it shows a graph of whatever variables I want, I usually start with probability of loss versus annualized expected return on margin, with a color code of maybe a figure of merit related to ruin theory. I can change any axis to any variable, set filters, and zero in on any section of the graph. It makes it really easy to find in on the best spreads.

I have a similar program for iron condors.

# $SHMP again ?

📷[**Graduating Penny Stock**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Graduating%20Penny%20Stock%22&restrict_sr=1)

Time to look at $SHMP again, too much happening now to look away. Many are talking about the application to NASDAQ which will be great but regardless there is so much revenue coming in 2021 there is no way this stock will not do well. Do your DD and join the Natural Shrimp shareholders group (SHMP) on Facebook. Just a couple things recently announced and this is on top of doubling the capacity at their La Coste, Tx location.

t3_j3dcp4,gloeve9,"I am holding with diamond hands! heres why ... Westwater Resources (NASDAQ: WWR) Is Looking Very Attractive Right Now.21% that I know of is sold short! There's 19M outstanding and 16M in the float. The shorts are scared as they have been increasing their positions a ton in the last few weeks and they have been posting negative (hit) comments and articles everywhere. It's a clear sign that diamond hands can squeeze these geniuses.

Here’s why…

Westwater may be the first major producer of battery grade graphite in the USA. The USA recently declared graphite a supply critical mineral. What the order means is the President requires certain government agencies to provide guidance in determining which projects are eligible for government support, which can include loans or grants. The agencies are also directed to use available authorities to accelerate the issuance of permits in connection with the expansion the supply chain for specified minerals.

In 2020, China will account for roughly 70% of all graphite produced, while the US only accounts for 1%. The United States Government is mandating this to change.

Current price $6.60/share

In Monday’s session, WWR shares opened at $5.90 per share after gapping from Friday’s close of $5.75, closing the day at $6.60 (+14.78%) per share. Trading volume was strong at 12M shares.

Let’s look at the graphite picture:

The market for graphite is growing. Every battery for an electric vehicle, cell phone, tablet, laptop, solar panel, and a plethora of other devices needs graphite. Every pencil and many lubricants use graphite. A diverse number of analysts place the growth of graphite consumption at 6-20% annualized growth rate.

The USA needs a source of domestic graphite, produced in large quantities and produced in an environmentally safe manner. Right now, America imports 100% of the graphite it consumes. The USA is literally at the mercy of its offshore trading partners for supply. China is the largest supplier, currently producing 70% of the world’s graphite. The graphite mined in China uses hydrofluoric in the refining process, creating a dangerous environmental cost. Westwater has filed a patent for their claim on an environmentally safe proprietary process.

The US President has issued an Executive order stating that America’s reliance on foreign sources for the minerals used in batteries a national security threat and advises government agencies to offer miners credit, other financial help, and ease in permitting to develop a domestic supply of graphite and other minerals used in batteries.

Now let’s look at Westwater Resources:

Westwater owns the most advanced graphite mine in the USA, located in Coosa County Alabama on 42,000 acres and called the Coosa Graphite Project. A Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) technical report for the Coosa Graphite Project was completed by AGP Mining Consultants Inc. in November 2015 and included an Indicated Resource of 78,488,000 tons, grading 2.39% graphitic carbon (Cg) at a 1% cutoff grade, for a total of 1,876,000 tons contained/in-situ graphite—the largest graphite Indicated Resource in the United States; and Inferred Resources of 79,443,000 tons, grading at 2.56% Cg at a 1% cutoff grade, for a total of 2,034,000 tons contained/in-situ graphite.

Currently, Chinese graphite sells for $500 to $1600 per ton depending on the flake size with the larger flake size going for a premium.

WWR has developed a method of processing graphite into its usable form that does not use hydrofluoric acid and has the potential to eliminate 300,000 tons of carbon emissions annually. The process is proprietary and is patent pending. The company is currently building a processing plant and in conjunction with three other facilities is processing 30 metric tons of graphite utilizing their new technology. This is happening right now!

The US government is involved in the development of a domestic graphite industry and WWR seems to have all the needed requirements to do just that in an environmentally responsible manner.

The US government carries stores of gold and oil to protect our national security. Could minerals for energy storage devices be coming into that equation?

WWR looks like it could be a ground floor opportunity, right now while the share price is low (54% off its October high). Keep in mind, the public float is only 15.78 million shares.

What is graphite?

A non-metallic mineral, Graphite is one of two natural forms of carbon (the other is diamond). With the highest natural strength and stiffness of any material, graphite is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. It is stable over a wide range of temperatures. Graphite is a highly refractory material with a high melting point (3650°C). Graphite has a high natural lubricity and is one of the lightest of all reinforcing agents. While chemically inert, Graphite also has a high resistance to corrosion.

There is an argument to be made for the frictional costs of letting a large number of employers go under simultaneously. While eventually we expect the outcome to be better - people will find new jobs and new businesses will emerge to compete in the wake of the failed ones - there will be a period of negative feedback loops where people who lost their jobs can't make other payments causing other industries/businesses to suffer as a result, in a vicious cycle.

If they have investor presentations posted to their sites after earnings, I definitely go through those.

If it's a company I'm considering, then I usually start at yahoo, look at the basic stats, price history, dividend history, etc. If that seems interesting, then I'll look at their balance sheets and P&L's, both end of most recent year and the last few quarters.

I believe Intel has always played ""smart"" with their dominant position, if they really turned the screws on AMD when dominant and killing them off, then they would face DOJ/FTC investigations on monopoly and antitrust violations. 

Did they get complacent? Yes, however considering they are also sitting on 25B of CASH ON HAND, pretty sure they'll be able to regain footing and bounce back. I believe the bigger shift this time around is the rise of ARM with general purpose/low power and ML/AI with high-throughput compute and Intel has been making inroads to both areas.  They've diversified a lot into things like storage (albeit with good success) but also lost focus on bread and butter (processors and manufacturing process leadership).

The downturn has been inevitable. Before the president entered office in January 2017 the Dow was at 19,804.72 and I’ve been saying over the last 4 years we’ve been experiencing a very stagnant market and not really seeing tremendous movements in any direction really

Election Day 2016 the Dow was 18,332.74
2017 January 19 the Dow was 19,804.72
2018 January 19 was 26,115.65
2019 January 18 (a Friday) was 24,370.10
2020 January 17 (a Friday) was 29,297.64
And here we are on October 28, 2020 only a couple months away from January 19, 2021 with the Dow at 26,519.95 and we’re right back to where we were in 2018 again

At one point around March 23, 2020 we dropped below 2016’s gains before settling 259 points above at 18,591.93

So like I said over the last 4 years a very stagnant market and now quite frankly totally propped up by the current government creating a lot of artificial valuations and overvalued positions and unless people got in before 2016 many of the retail investors and trend/momentum chasers unfortunately have been bleeding funds repeatedly if not wiping out all their gains repeatedly over the last 4 years chasing imaginary profits

Quite frankly between now and Inauguration Day I wouldn’t be surprised if stocks in the Dow further correct themselves for the existing bubble and fall back to the 18,000s again. After all it would only take a good month or two of solid red drops for this to be true and we seem to have a long hard winter coming around the corner",2,1603946114,[],,,

Last year around this time there was big talk about a huge resession expected within months or possibly weeks, and calm people reminded everyone that the same had been said the year before that. People keep guessing when it is all going to fall, and one day someone will get it right, and the one who gets it right gets crowned the new King or Queen of predictions, mostly based on luck.

The ones who need to worry are traders or people looking to make a quick buck. If you worry about getting rich fast, you will worry about lost opportunity, but no one can accurately predict how things are going to go. The bubble will burst, that is the only certainty we have, no one knows when, so again, be in it on the long run.   
Invest in companies with a solid concept, companies you believe in and want to support, and you really don't have to worry that much. Supplement your investments with gold, silver, cryptocurrency etc if you feel inclined, and try to take the backseat.  
Lost opportunities is basically another word for ""unbought winning lottery ticket"" for the most part in my book, and the only time you can really start talking about lost opportunity is if you choose to stand outside this whole thing out of fear, or holding onto your money with it's value minus inflation in hopes of catching the stockmarket in it's perfect downfall.",20,1604255817,[],,,

t3_jtqn8f,gc8x4v2,"I bought PTON at ~100 today. In the past 10 days, the US has had eight record days of Covid cases. The news of Pfizer’s vaccine caused a lot of movement everywhere, leading to an increase in airline and hotel stocks and a decrease in stay-at-home stocks. However, it is important to keep in mind 

1) Distribution will be an issue. Even if the vaccine was proven safe and released tomorrow, actually getting it out to people would prove to be an issue

2) According to polls,[only 58% of Americans](https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/10/19/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-racial-disparities/) would be willing to get vaccinated as soon as it was released. This number is down from the 69% that was reported in August. 

3) The movement we saw November 9/10th should be compared to the rest of the year. A 5% increase in the month of November doesn’t equate to huge profit if your stock is down 20% for the year. 

We all know that eventually, Covid-19 will end, but it won’t be happening any time soon. Way too many people get pissed about wearing masks and staying home,so it only makes sense that the US is handling the pandemic terribly.

Too much concentrated power within the business world is not good for the economy as a whole. I am not here to say stuff like eat the rich, but I think it's something to be cautions with a company of this size:

1. I doubt that Amazon would fail any time soon, but if they decide to collapse for whatever reason (e.g. failed ventures, class-action lawsuits, government intervention, etc.), we'd be in a recession for years to come when the market struggles to fill what Amazon has been building over the years
2. If Amazon doesn't fail and the government doesn't break it up, **theoretically speaking**, they will eventually take over every other sector of the economy and everyone suffers because there isn't any competition. There would be no economic growth, no innovation, no new IPOs and ventures that investors can take advantage of, etc. since there's no money left to be made. Of course, that's a hypothetical situation if Amazon takes over *everything,* but I doubt that would happen any time soon since he's not the only billionaire in the United States.",2,1605681224,[],,,
t3_jvt5fo,gcpifxg,"In the industry: it was a smart move after CVS bought the last huge insurance company. There wasn’t any insurers left for Amazon to buy so whats the entry into the market? Cash paying customers. They took the Walmart model and went next level: all rebates (both generic rebates and brand rebates) they receive they’re giving right to the customer (they’ll make money on the warehouse markup and prime growth). No middleman of 3rd party warehouse, huge undercutting of pharmacy pricing, ever improving delivery performance, etc. It’ll grab that market very quickly which is significant. The thing I’m not understanding is the partnership with all these pharmacies..haven’t figured out why they would work with amazon. Short term benefit to long term very bad impact in my opinion.  Maybe Amazon is talking to them about being a warehouse provider to them eventually (ie if there is one loser here it is McKesson). Pharmacies companies shedding capital etc invested in warehouse sector, similar to how all cell companies in areas rent from companies that solely put up towers.

The next phase is the one that will be very interesting and where the meat is: insurance companies and their massive customer base. Amazon will have to offer an insurance model of some kind, either an enhanced prime membership etc. With the integration in other pharmacy groups with both insurers and carriers, Amazon will not be getting those customers..., but their insurance prime might begin attracting companies to move their health plans over. 

In my opinion there won’t be many players left: amazon, walmart, and cvs/caremark. Walgreens may end up getting aligned with one of those. There will still be need for physical location but much reduced.

But it seems their earnings have been in steady decline and the downward trend is forecast to continue into next several (3ish) years.

Or are these calculations based on certain figures in their financials? I’ve always felt confused by this

[Exclusive: Moderna spars with U.S. scientists over COVID-19 vaccine trials](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-moderna-exclusive-idUSKBN2481EU)

[Labs are experimenting with new – but unproven – methods to create a coronavirus vaccine fast](https://theconversation.com/labs-are-experimenting-with-new-but-unproven-methods-to-create-a-coronavirus-vaccine-fast-134319)

So one of the first challenges for the FDA is do they want to consider the mRNA delivery method as viable treatment options both now and far into the future. The second challenge for Moderna specifically (not so much with some of the others) is convincing the FDA with no history of their own to back it up that they are worth an approval even on emergency basis

As of close today, this deal priced Slack at $45.52 ($26.79 + $18.73 (0.0776 share of CRM at $241.35/sh)). 

WORK will now move with CRM since the cash is fixed. If CRM goes up, those 0.0776 shares are worth more. If CRM goes down, they’re worth less.

Risks of selling now:
* if a bidding war improbably starts, you lose out
* if CRM rallies, you missed on a Slack increase

Rewards of selling now:
* if the deal improbably falls apart, WORK will crater but you already locked in by selling
* if CRM falls, you already locked in by selling

If you have another investment you want to buy into but don’t have the cash, then sell. Odds are CRM will trade relatively flat which means so will WORK. If you want to own CRM, sell WORK and buy CRM now. Fee-free trading has made waiting for a deal to close pretty obsolete.

Today: the US now wants to change the agreement but China has so far resisted. This push gained momentum after the Luckin Coffee scandal (btw, it was a Chinese firm that exposed Luckin).  
Analysis: this is just a leverage play to force China to come to some form of agreement. US investors, hedge funds, pension funds have already invested billions into Chinese companies.

t3_k5oc7s,gehvikq,"TRNE and APXT are the two I have the most knowledge on since there's more concrete information available. SRAC in particular sounds cool, but it's just so speculative that I'm not wanting to take the risk at the moment. My quick summaries:

Desktop Metal (TRNE) has some pretty lofty ""shoot for the stars"" financial ambitions, but their actual products have recently started making the rounds and are seemingly well-received so far. Also, the fact that they've attracted interest from BMW, Ford, Koch, Google Venture, etc. is a pretty big plus. Their merger finalization date is next week too, and movement is already starting to pick up. This is one I think has a lot of overlooked hype if it does well. Long term, they'll either be huge or fizzle out; I don't see much of a middle ground. 


AvePoint (APXT) is attractive to me because of how well they are managed. Zero debt, actual profit and demonstrable growth. They are dependent on Microsoft, but Microsoft partners with them directly and has a good relationship from what I've found. If you look back a few years ago, AvePoint's products were initially unfavorably compared to companies like ShareGate, but more recently they apparently made a pretty big effort to step up their game; their reception in the past year or so has shifted very positively. If you have reason to think Microsoft 365 will unexpectedly go under, maybe avoid this one.

But if that doesn't happen, the options expire worthless and you've lost the money. But that's how insurance works in every industry.

How I would start:

1. Learn about different assets their risk / reward, tax and your country's regulations, brokers, your time horizon  and your own limitations as an investor. 

Only you can and should decide what to do. 

2. Dont give into FOMO or wait forever for a big dip / crash

3. Enough money into emergency account / savings account

4. Get into the market with a broad and cheap ETF tracking the msci world / ftse all world / sp500 etc. to get a feel for fluctuations and how you cope with them. 

5. Have cash aside for further investments whether its dollar cost averaging / averaging down your initial investments or buying into new ones.
These could be be ETFs like the ones by ARK or individual stocks. 

6. Remember to do your due dilligence.

t3_kd0zlu,gful81k,"""People are more likely to believe inflation is coming when the news is full of it. Or that a recession is coming when everyone is tweeting about it. Or that a stock is going up when its all over Reddit. ""

You may want to do a deeper dive on the ""who"" behind the tweets and posts. Just because people are talking about something doesn't mean that they are intending for the stock to go that way - e.g. hyping up a stock when a big player is looking to cash out and conversely, trashing a stock when a big player is trying to get in cheap. You saw a lot of the former with a lot of the escalated messaging around the reddit meme stocks. I can't say that this was nefarious agenda pushing or just the equivalent of the barber giving stock advice, but the same holds true anyways. Social media gives everyone a voice with the false pretense of everyone's voice requiring the same value.

To your datasets:

\- Structured finance data is your gold standard.

\- Alternative datasets are fine, but might impose a LOT of noise due to variability. Then again, not sure what kind of datasets you're working with here.

\- People tweeting and redditing. This is a project in itself. You're doing classification, semantic analysis and content filtering and general analysis on account ""truthiness""

Finally... correlation is one thing. You're looking for causal. The way the HFT traders do this is intercept where the money is going and just assume that big money = big money already did the hard research part and they know something. They basically let everyone else do the hard work and open up shop next door (cough..cough..BurgerKing)

I recently decided to trade through volatility to increase my holdings in a company I believe in and set a limit sell near where the stock cap was trending. It sold at that level and I immediately set a limit buy where the bottom was trending. It worked and I increased my holdings by 13% for free. I immediately set a limit sell again after I re-evaluated where I thought the cap would be based on trends and it's getting close to hitting again.  Assuming that sale closes I'll set another limit buy for where I think the bottom will be to once again increase my holdings for free. Based on my current estimates, if this works I'll increase my holdings by another 21% (37% from when I started).  So far I've learned that this takes a lot of patience and commitment, but if trends continue, it's worth it.

t3_kdltt2,gfxe1rl,"It’s hard to know what is true in the world of stocks, with analysts trying to have you sell stocks they want to buy from you (Hey we have to buy million dollars of Tesla, you should totally sell right now ;), and strong opinions clouding so much of the finical atmosphere. 

Dedicate some of the portfolio to playing it safe with some large market cap stocks like Apple - but let’s get real, do we ever expect 2Trillion to 10x? And if it does, is that a future we even want?

Against a lot of judgment from what I could find online, I decided to start an “IPO collection” Holding about 30 stocks in my portfolio and few additional index funds - I’m trying to hold about 10 IPO stocks with long term vision to really see what can happen overtime. Which I hope in a decades time will really show which was the better investment. Apple’s amazing now - but the real people investors benefiting are people who got in decades ago, not the the small fries like myself buying less than a billionth of the company in the 21st century

Airbnb, Unity, and Snowflake all burst out the gates from their valuations - so far Unity and Snowflake have seemed to show overall positive from their valuations - and even if a bit optimistic, they are like safe bets that guarantee value long term 

- If you’re into Game Dev, you might realize how big Unity and Unreal really are and how much room they have to grow - At conferences like GDC in SF, the Unity and Unreal Booths are potetionally bigger dogs than Microsoft, google, and sony (And the sort of direct competivness Unity has with Unreal is healthy competition for long term growth in innovation (like apple and Microsoft growing in unison.)

Snowflake hosts some big names out there (quite a few companies you might own yourself! Providing data storage for companies like Sony, Caterpillar, Take Two Interactive, a whole bunch more) and these cloud platforms essentially have your data locked into their platform so it’s harder to leave)

AirBnB suprised me by doubling out the gates - Even if it gets corrected, will continue dollar cost averaging in for the long-term. The community is very strong, giving the company a long-term stability - Really good experiences with the company as a host, customer, and knowing employees, the margins are huge and the room to grow is very much still there.

Looking forward, am very excited to get in on Roblox too. 20 years later and I still love Legos, roblox seems to me, to be just as long-term visioned as Lego. -The platform is set up in a way for developers to be able to create content fast within the eco-system, for a seemingly infinite supply of content. The player base has a young target demographic so there will always be new kids trying the game out - and with some of its longer term visions, could expand to grow even further

Without writing too many more notes some of the other IPOs I got in on: 

Virgin Galatic SPCE - What if I told you, I own a spaceship company? 

Uber - As technology advances will robotaxi kill Uber? Or simply adapt its business model. As VTOL/ aviation/automation become more streamlined, I see a very profitable future for Uber with their long term visions

Zuora - The backbone behind many subscription services - recently got caught up in legal trouble, out of all listed this has been my worst performing to date.

Warner Music Group - If you have some idea how royalties work maybe you can see how big of a buy this is. Michael Jackson was only as crazy rich as he was because he understood the royalty game. Imagine every single song is a copyright, yea? And every single time it is duplicated, there’s money involved. Every single click on a streaming service, play of an advertisment, cover of the song, show. And this is the publisher, owning multiple artists - collecting money virtually every single second 24/7/365 paying back to you in some dividends

Lemonade - My most short-sighted IPO, I see lemonade has the ability to grow like wild fire and I will dump as it finds it and multiplies 10x from my investment",8,1608045241,"[['SPCE', 1], ['GOOG', 1], ['SNE', 1], ['AAPL', 1], ['rblx', 1]]",SPCE,24.510000228881836,27.440000534057617

Understanding The Market Requires you to Understand Market Psychology
Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time! 
When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them. 
9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!
9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself. 
10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback. 
11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. 
11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it. 
1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in. 
2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price. 
--- 
3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves. 
As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile. 
3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”.

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade 
1.    Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk. 
2.    Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily. 
3.    IV Percentile – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk. 
4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa. 
5.    Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value. 
Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price. 
6.    Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low. 
7.    Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%. 
8.    Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.

You might look at funds like NOBL if you’re interested in dividend returns. It’s a fund that only holds companies that have a long, stable history of increasing dividends. There are other, probably better options, but as an example of what’s out there, that’s a pretty good one. Type dividend ETF into Robinhood and you’ll see some other examples. The problem is you need to get a lot of “bang for your buck” while also protecting your buck and not overpaying, and that’s not easy.

You need to do some reading before you stray at all from Bogley index funds.

(ii)  If it were me, I wouldn't get an advisor, or I would find a fee-only advisor who would give me once-off advice, if  you can find one.  I sure wouldn't give an advisor 1% on an ongoing basis, and I sure wouldn't go to an advisor who wants to sell me his shitty mutual funds.

(iii)  I'd avoid a concentrated portfolio like the plague.  Giant companies sometimes fail, and there's better ways to annuitize your million than just living off the yield.

(iv)  Let's suppose you want to be safe-ish, and plan for a payout to age 95.  Let's suppose you're 35.

Remember the quote “ a fool and his money are soon parted”

Always remember it.

I can attest to it but I learned a huge lesson and that lesson is risk management.

I was able to build an account of 2k into 40k in less than 3 weeks. 
In dollars that not impressive but in percentages that’s over 1000%

The next week, I got scared and thought the market was crashing and I liquidated everything.
Took a 75% loss in one day.

My mistake? Not managing risk. 
I invested 100% of all profits into other trades.
When I should have started taking less risks.— I made more than I ever made working in 3-5 years working bs jobs, goddamint.

But that taught me 5 different lessons that will forever stay with me and will help me build my portfolio again with an added security measure- Risk Management.

Now, cutting my losses was my first priority because I didn’t want to go back to work so I stayed with over 200% of what I started with. 
Not bad. 
I learned two counter intuitive lessons. 
Cut losses and manage risk.
If I would have held on to those invesments I’d have over 2000% today because guess what? It was a market correction not a crash.
Two days after all the companies I was in started to climb back to my expected price range.

I’ll build that back up again in about 3 weeks.
But nowI will have more appreciation for money, because those trades and all that money had me thinking I was George Soros.


To cut the story short;
When you’re starting from the bottom, huge risks don’t matter because in the real world 50k means nothing. But if you know how to manage your risks with a proven system in hand,  you can make hundred thousands and up to millions *but that takes dedication and skill development.*

~~Huge amount of the population is unwilling to develop their skills or maybe their minds/genetics doesn’t let them.~~

Now if you’re starting with a million dollars, your biggest concern should be how not to lose it,  not to multiply it.

If you don’t know what to do with it, the safest bet is to secure a roof to live in.
Look into house hacking if you have no assets.

Giving money to someone else to manage is it very risky specially if you’re not in that field.

Look into your skills, and if you don’t have skills, seek to improve.

Zoom out, look at the bigger picture.

Lots to learn but the key is just to pay attention to factual information on a the world level. Invest in companies you know are innovative (TSLA, AMZN, AAPL) ...So many choices. And while the world is in turmoil, it creates opportunities.

Lastly, if you do well, maybe YOLO some profits on Meme stocks. It’s like playing with house money so you can be a bit braver. NIO, PLTR have done well lately. 

Regarding diversification, consider buying a rental property. We have a few so if for some crazy reason we could not sell our stocks due to a Black Swan event (unlikely) we’d still have the real estate income.

t3_kghps5,gggax5m,"I actually work in this space, my advice would be to keep it simple if you are going to try and go it on your own. If you are young, invest in some index ETFs across the entire equity market spectrum with a higher focus on the US (large cap, mid cap, small cap, REITs) but still some exposure to international and emerging markets. If you are planning on living off the money now or in the near term you would want to add some highly rated corporate bond exposure and a little high yield exposure. You really don’t need mutual funds for most US equities but honestly they add a lot of value in the real estate, bond, and international markets. There are managers that actually consistently outperform in those spaces even net of fees, but since you won’t get institutional share classes with the lowest expense ratios nor possibly the time and effort to research the right funds to pick, you might be better off with indexing those as well. I don’t know how much time you plan on actually spending on figuring this out, but that plays a role in deciding how passive or active you want to be. I have seen people mention there are funds that track the best dividend payers and the so called ‘dividend aristocrats’, but they shouldn’t be the end all be all and would maybe satisfy a piece of your large cap exposure. 

Definitely don’t blow it all in AT&T or Exxon, but if you want to make a few individual picks in industries you actually know about and understand the basics of stock and balance sheet analysis then there’s nothing wrong with that. If you want to add some income to the account, look at selling covered calls on the stocks or ETFs you pick up, or selling covered puts to get into them in the first place.

The most important thing you need to know is that you don’t need to use all the capital at once, and that you should do a lot of your own research to check what anyone tells you on here. I love reading all the different investing subs and get the occasional idea I like from some of them, but at the end of the day you need to be able to independently verify whatever you are reading. If you honestly don’t have the time to be able to figure it out and do it right by yourself, then you really should be getting professional help.",2,1608449027,[],,,
t3_kghps5,gggbf7f,"So a few people have already told you to diversify. Yes, betting a huge chunk of your retirement on one company is dumb. Companies fall from grace all the time. 

There is a reason ""T"" and ""XOM"" have large dividends. It is because they face headwinds. T has issues with a giant chunk of their users either dying (boomers) or cutting the cord on their cable subscription. They have a $158 BILLION in debt (although perfectly manageable in the near-term since they are cash flow kings). I don't have to tell you why XOM faces an uphill battle in the future. But in the near-term, you might make plenty in dividends and perhaps even reinvest some of the extra cash. But looking forward a decade or two, the underlying stock value will potentially erode. And often what follows is a cut in dividend. Which would be a big problem for your retirement plans.

So yes, diversification is good. Today there are tons of low fee ETFs and mutual funds that can still provide enough to retire on (as long as you are willing to live frugally and in a low cost of living area). 

I recommend SPYD for this approach. It is an ETF that holds the 80 highest dividend generating companies in the S&P 500 (and that includes XOM and T). The dividend averages around 4.5%, although in very sudden down turns it can briefly dip as low as the 3% range as it did earlier this year.

And I don't want to open a whole can of worms but perhaps talk to a professional about investing in ""O."" It is a REIT which means a real estate company (kinda). The cool thing about O is that it generates dividends MONTHLY instead of quarterly or annually. So you'd basically get your monthly allowance. And the dividend IS THE KING OF STABLE. Just [look at this baby](https://imgur.com/gallery/hKLycmP).

Their website touts the following: *605 Consecutive Monthly Dividends Paid,  93 Consecutive Quarterly Dividend Increases*

So this went a little long. But I recommend you pay up for a pro to assist you. It wouldn't even be that much. But you have inherited a life-changing amount of wealth. Don't be impulsive to invest where a redditor tell you to. And don't be impulsive to burn too much of that million dollars on cars or Vegas. With the right lifestyle, you might never work again.

These dividends aren’t always guaranteed as life events can happen to make a company reduce or cut their dividend (ie. Covid).

For dividend investing it’s best to be diversified for a couple of reasons.  #1 being what i said above. #2 if you split all of that money between say 10 - 15 companies that pay a dividend you will get those dividend payouts more often then just once a quarter.  The idea here is to get paid every month so that you have consistent cash flow, so it’s best to find companies that have opposite payout schedules.

Another thing that you didn’t factor in is the taxes that you would have to pay on those dividends.  In short you would need much more money than that to live comfortably at $50k per year.

I’m not sure what nationality you’re from, but you definitely need to think about what insurance your brokerage firm(s) have. This protects your stocks, funds, etc. in the case that your broker goes bankrupt. 

For example, in the U.S., all assets held in brokerage firms are covered by federal SIPC insurance up to $500,000. This means that if you put $1mil in with just one broker, half of that money is immediately at risk. If the broker goes bankrupt, you will lose half of your money.

My advice would be to split it up between several different brokers. If it was $1mil, I would park $250,000 with 4 different brokers, so that all of the accounts are completely covered and have room to grow the balance.

My first stock was SONY which I bought after reading an article in the NYT about how BetaMax was going to revolutionize digital recording.  It didn't but the stock went from $16 to $32 within 12 months.  

My 2nd stock was a little computer company called Apple.  I took my SONY profit and bought 400 shares of AAPL for $7 a share.  When it shot to $28 within 14 months I was sure I was a genius.  It took about 5-7 more years for me to figure out that I wasn't.  

I didn't become a profitable trader, I became a profitable investor.  The AAPL stock that I sold because it hit $28 would be worth over $1,0000,000 today, had I kept it.  I'm not complaining, I have owned AAPL 4 times, including right now and it has made me money each time.  

What I did wrong was trade,.  What I did right was learning that every stock doesn't need to be a high flyer.  In 1983 I bought 100 shares of T for $11 a share.  Today I get over $1100 a quarter in dividends from those same shares.  T hasn't produced the 1300+% that FB gave me but it has given me thousands of dollars in dividends over 30+ years.

My wife and I each opened and maxed out our Roth IRA accounts with her grandpa’s Wells Fargo advisor. We wanted an aggressive growth fund, so he suggested FTHCX. Those are up about 10% since some time in November. We’ll probably put our 2021 contributions toward the same fund or part of it towards a clean energy fund.

I started investing on Robinhood at the start of November with $2,000. Did some research and decided I didn’t care too much and blue chip companies like Apple and Microsoft since they were already in my IRA. I decided to put a good amount of my money into NIO and rode that hype train up for a while.

On December 4th I came across STPK,  special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that was rumoring to announce a merge with energy storage company Stem Inc. in the first quarter of next year.  They ended  up officially announcing the merge the next day I believe. Over the next week or so I sold off all the stocks I had and went all in on STPK.

Today was actually almost a big milestone for me, I was $2.77 away from doubling my initial $2,000 investment. I’m sitting at 99.8% gains since November 2nd, and I think I can realistically turn this into $10k by the end of 2021. 

Im still super inexperienced, but I think so far I’ve learned to do tons of research before making an investment, and invest like you believe in it.

Then there is the “leveraging while young”/“lifecycle investing” type threads that address using leverage over your lifetime to improve lifetime risk adjusted return. Essentially you try to spread your equity exposure more evenly across your life, using margin when you are young and reducing your equity allocation in retirement.

t3_kkkax9,gh34fhd,Use your own fund for long term and margin for day trades...  gain or loss clear the day trading inventory everyday ... if you can do it ... use the margin otherwise stay away ...,3,1609003991,[],,,
t3_kkkax9,gh4zckd,"I’m shocked there isn’t a single comment that says it’s okay to do this. 

I would say it’s fine under certain circumstances. It depends how risky the rest of your portfolio is. If it’s risky, I would suggest keeping margin at 10% of total purchases. If it’s not risky, 20% should be fine. Risky is generally more cyclical or higher PE stocks. Not risky includes dividend payers and low beta stocks. Generally, you’ll be fine. 

Basically, I would say there’s a time to run (aka take on margin) and a time to walk. Right now is a time to run in reopening stocks. Green light go. Once we’ve leveled off, I would suggest dropping it to 10% margin, and then you can take it back up to 20% margin on the next 10% dip, and then take it back down again when we hit a new high. Generally, this is a safe strategy that will perform slightly above average. 

I say all this without knowing your tax situation. If you are in a higher tax bracket, margin makes less sense. Short term gains are almost 50% between federal, state, niit, and maybe city taxes. It doesn’t really make sense to take margin up and down to pay 50% in taxes. The additional returns from margining are minimal over long terms. If your tax rate are low though,  then it’s a better scenario in which to take on margin. 

And as someone else suggested, consider just selling puts on stocks you like, or way out of the money near term calls on the stocks you own. You’ll be paying up to 50% again, but it accomplishes a similar low risk, low return goal. 

Overall, if you are going to get a 10% return, and you can margin up to 11%, you need to ask yourself if it’s worth doing at all and have to worry about it. Personally, I only use margins on big dips. I have margined maybe a total of 30 months in the last decade. Has worked well for me.

But it is potentially risky if you don’t know the risks.",3,1609043179,[],,,

Completely agree on the reason I'm extremely bullish on AAPL - service offerings. I've been using the Apple Fitness trial (3 months) and honestly... really like it. Pairs great with the Apple Watch. Most days I'll just do a core workout, ten minutes, before my actual workout. HIIT ones are challenging. Hopefully they actually add some iso strength workouts in the future and ability to sort workouts by body part in the future. Now that's just one part. I use the iCloud storage, Apple Music, and perhaps Apple TV in the near future. Bundling these offerings is only going to increase the appeal and exposure.
