I am currently doing valuation work on a telecommunications company which has its assets in Europe and provides internet connectivity to private companies.

Similar to telecoms in the US, it is run by a PE group, produces negative cash flow and earnings due to large CapEx and depreciation yearly, and has only just turned EBITDA positive.

t3_1vvhry,Thoughts on Declining Revenues? (Pfizer),"Hello everyone,


What is your thoughts on a company that has declining revenues? Typically I have a rule of thumb that if a company has two years in a row of declining revenues that I sell. This may seem ignorant but I would rather have my money in growing companies.


I have owned shares of Pfizer for a little while now and it came up on my portfolio annual review as one to sell as they have had now 3 years of declining revenues. However it appears the answer isn't so simple.


PFE's stock has gone up in almost a straight line over the past five years. However it isn't necessarily the business outperforming but a mixture of cutting R&D and share buybacks to boost EPS.


Last year they spun off Zoetis which has around $5billion in annual revenues. If shareholders would have received ZTS from the spinoff I wouldn't be having this discussion and be more than happy to hold.  However they did an IPO and shareholders did not get any shares. As Pfizer continues to spinoff businesses like this what should I do with my position?


They do have steady cash flow from their consumer brands (Advil, Centrum, ChapStick, Robitussin, Preperation H, Thermacare) and still have strong sales from a couple blockbuster prescription drugs (Lipitor, Viagra, Chantix). So there is very little risk in the business, they are setup for success. Not to mention a 3.30% yield.
Because of their declining sales though they have a PEG ratio of an outstanding 4.56!! How can I ignore that? That is the highest PEG in my entire portfolio. This a strong indication I should sell.


Reddit, what should I do? Hold Pfizer and allow them to scale down via spinoffs and continue to buyback shares even though R&D has been cut which impacts future growth? Or Sell Pfizer due to declining revenues?",4,1.0,1390419110,"[['PEG', 2], ['ZTS', 1]]",PEG,32.119998931884766,33.400001525878906

t3_1xt8lv,Technology Investment Opportunities in Canada: BSM Technologies (GPS),"BSM Technologies is a telematics supplier for the rail, construction and utility industries in North America.  For those unfamiliar with this technology, I would recommend going to BSM’s website or to Wikipedia.  BSM makes its money by selling hardware units and software services (SaaS) on a recurring basis that are used to monitor fleets of vehicles.  The company currently has a market cap of $120mln and net cash on its balance sheet of $25mln.  In 2014, BSM is expected to generate $28mln in sales and $5.85mln in EBITDA and free cash flow.  The company has been both net income and cash flow positive for the past 3 years while experiencing growth north of 30%.  

Aly Rahemtulla, originally an investor and now currently CEO, is responsible for much of the company’s transformation and success over the past few years.  Unhappy with the way the business was being run, Aly came on board as CEO in 2008, divesting underperforming segments and focusing the company primarily on the rail industry.  Shortly after, BSM won a major Teir 1 rail contract in Canada supplying its technology to the rubber-tire maintenance fleet.  To date, the company has a strong position in 4 of the 7 Teir 1 North American railways, is in discussions with the remaining 3 and has begun selling units to short line railways.  Furthermore, the company has won significant contracts with utility customers such as Bell, MTS, The Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York, Hydro Quebec and a variety of others.

BSM’s value to customers is simple.  Their technology provides fleet optimization (reducing the number of required vehicles), fuel savings, and lowers maintenance costs.  The ROI is highly visible and customers are quick to see the benefits of rolling out telematics solutions.  Specifically, customers report 7% savings on fuel and greater than 10% improvement in fleet utilization.  In most cases, the technology pays for itself in less than 1 year.

The total market opportunity servicing the rail vertical alone is 40,000 units.  Today, the company supplies ~8,500.  BSM charges $400 - $700 per hardware unit (depending on the model) and $25/month for the software.  Therefore, there is $12.6mln - $22mln in potential hardware sales and $9.5mln in recurring software revenue left to be rolled out.  The recurring software revenue is very high margin (75%) and ultimately is the source of cash flow for the business.  Therefore, management is working hard to secure sales of hardware units.  Outside of rail the opportunities are equally significant as evidenced by previous customer wins.  

In January of 2014, the company raised $22mln at $3/sh in the open markets.  Since then, the stock has sold down to $2.50 – absolutely terrible performance.  Why has this happened after all the positives I laid out above?  Is it valuation?  With Canadian tech companies like Constellation Software at 17x, Descartes at 16x, Avigilon at 23x, Enghouse at 15x, Computer Modeling Group at 21x, Redknee at 16x, Solium at 15x versus BSM currently at 15x I do not believe this is the case.  Instead, I would attribute the performance to a lack of announcements regarding acquisitions or new contract win.  However, this is where investors are being given an opportunity.  

The last acquisition (Autovision) was done at $14.7mln and added EBITDA of $2.5mln.  At the current multiple, this added 15x $2.5mln = $37.5mln gross value or $37.5mln - $14.7mln = $22.8mln of net value. Given managements criteria for acquisitions (strategic, profitable and accretive), the deployment of $25mln in cash can create significant value for shareholders.  I estimate that optionality, which we are currently getting for close to nothing, is ~$30mln on a current market cap of $124mln which equates to 30% upside on cash deployment alone.  Then we have synergies plus base business execution.  

There always exists risks with small cap technology investments but I can point to few that are as well capitalized, profitable and growing at the speed of BSM.  Outside of public markets, Telematics continues to be a very attractive investment area in North America due to the recurring nature of cash flows.  A gap continues to exist between BSM and other telematics companies publically listed in the US (e.g. 18.5x for Fleetmatics). Ultimately, I believe BSM will get acquired for their foothold in the rail industry. 

Interested in hearing others comments.

t3_1y9jev,Canadian Stocks: Investing without resources II,"Approximately 2 years have passed since I followed up on my earlier post (http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/nxuuo/canadian_stocks_investing_without_resources/).  Let’s start by reviewing investment performance assuming we employed a ""buy and hold"" strategy, equally weighting the 3 recommendations.

As of Feb 2014, GLN declined 20%, EIF was flat and ACQ increased 580%.  Therefore, an equally weighted portfolio would have returned 187% versus the broader TSX which returned 23%.  Despite two stocks that underperformed during this period, I will consider the last two years a victory.  I would also mention that this experience provides evidence in favor of taking a portfolio approach to investing.

So what happened with GLN and EIF?

As a reminder, Glentel is one of the largest independent wireless retailers throughout North America. The company holds licenses to resell mobile phone and data contracts for both Rogers and Bell in Canada as well as Verizon in the United States. In 2013 the company undertook an expansion project aimed at growing the business outside of North America. The attempt was unsuccessful and the company was forced to take a significant write-down to reflect this underperformance.  Although disappointing, Glentel’s North American business remains strong and management has proven its ability to grow the business in this region.  Since 2011, Revenue and EBITDA have grown.  Therefore, investors are assuming the company will continue to destroy value going forward.

In my opinion, investors are discounting the company’s shares as a result of this past transaction and drastically undervaluing the core business.  The company continues to generate significant amounts of free cash flow which it returns in the form of both regular and special dividends (currently yielding 3.7%).  Management is highly motivated through their 35% stock ownership and therefore I believe is working hard to fix their past mistakes.  In the meantime, the dividend offers appropriate compensation for patient investors.   

Exchange Income Fund decided to make an acquisition of a mobile tower construction company in the US.  The company they acquired, West Tower, has a contract with AT&T that increased in scale dramatically since the acquisition.  As this occurred, management lost control of expenses resulting in segment margins well below expectations.  The company is trying hard to fix these problems but, admittedly, it is difficult to determine whether or not they will be successful.  Management has been changed and a review of business processes has been ongoing.  It will likely take a few quarters before these issues are rectified.

Comparable companies such as MTZ in the US have very good businesses in this area of the market.  That said, it took them many years before they got to the level they are today.  I therefore believe EIF will require time before they resolve their problems.  The dividend payout is high yet management has said they are committed to its sustainability.  My concern is that it takes longer for the company to recover from their missteps and management will be left without any options other than reducing the dividend.  As a result, this investment is under review.

t3_22swp6,Spirit Airlines - Forming a Thesis,"A while back I listened to a NPR Planet Money Podcast interview with Spirit Airlines CEO Ben Boldanza which really caught my attention. The business model and the company culture really stuck in my head (even though I am not sure I would want to fly Spirit myself). I believe Spirit (SAVE) exhibits some characteristics of other high quality businesses.
I would like to prove out my theory (one way or the other) by doing some analysis and was wondering where are some good places to start as I am not an experienced security analyst. Although I do have access to Capital IQ and Bloomberg through my day job. In addition I wouldn't mind hearing what other people think about the stock.

*Ben Baldanza seems to be a highly capable and passionate CEO. I don’t have any solid data points but he seems to potentially be shareholder friendly in terms of capital allocation.  Unfortunately he does not have a large stake in the firm

*Spirit has a company culture oriented on cutting costs. Examples include their bare bones corporate headquarters.

*As part of Spirit’s strategy of “unbundling” their service for their customers they are focused on gaining market share by giving back to the customers to increase the loyalty effect. (scaled shared economics).  In a recent WSJ article discussing the potential downfall of Southwest there was a chart showing how all of the major airlines prices have increased in 2013 relative to 2008, but Spirits ticket prices actually went down.  This reminds me of Costco. http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303949704579459643375588678

*Spirit exhibits signs of being ahead of the innovation curve. Whether it is in terms of marketing, willingness to advertise within the airplane, or putting sleeper beds in the cargo hold they are clearly not afraid of taking little bets.  http://www.amazon.com/Little-Bets-Breakthrough-Emerge-Discoveries/dp/1439170436

*Spirit largely has a bad reputation, but it doesn’t seem to have stopped them from keeping people coming back and filling up the seats. I think the bad reputation stems from customers going to a website and seeing the cheapest flight and buying it without knowing exactly what they are getting into. Leisure travelers who are either not bringing carry-ons or paying for their carry-ons via internet beforehand seem to be repeat customers. (An unaware traveler who brings luggage to the gate will be sorely disappointed as Spirit charges for ALL extra services. They also charge more for more human involvement. For examples it is more expensive to check a carry-on on the internet rather than with a human. This allows Spirit to staff less employees and boosts their margins.) Baldanza has admitted that they are trying to do a better job of getting the word out there about how Spirit works in order to avoid dissatisfied customers. 

*Spirit offers a $9/month subscription for repeat customers, which enables savings for repeat customers. (Costco)

*Spirit maintains a 30% gross margin which is well above the relevant competitors. Spirit barely has a toe in in terms of market share. Their biggest markets right now are Fort Lauderdale and Dallas right now. This year they plan to add flights in Baltimore, Detroit, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis and Philadelphia for a 22%. If Spirit can continue to steadily, but conservatively expand while keeping its margins intact I would think that would lead a healthy shareholder return.

*The stock currently trades at a trailing P/E of 23.5 which seems expensive, but that doesn’t factor in future growth.  Spirit’s cash from operations has grown from 69 to 195 million between 2009 and 2013. They currently have no debt and a healthy cash cushion. Their fleet is relatively young and they have more in the pipeline. (On a separate note, I believe they only have 1 type of planes which makes it cheaper in terms of maintenance. Employees only need to know 1 kind of plane. They only need parts for 1 type of plane.) 

So those are my thoughts on Spirit and I would love to hear what people think as well as what kind of analysis I can do. Don’t mind taking criticism as well.

t3_2794d6,What am I missing here?,"Ticker Symbol: RICK. Rick's Cabaret. Essentially a chain of strip clubs and adult oriented restaurants. They own most of the real estate. Have a market cap of $102mn. Debt of $85mn, but obviously the real estate is held at cost and they have been acquiring it since 1995. LTM EBITDA generation of $29.6mn, which means they are trading at EV/EBITDA of only 6x(3/31). Buffalo Wild Wings trades at 14x(admittedly no debt). RICKS has an EBITDA/INT PMT ratio of 3.9x.

Worst case scenario, someone comes in, breaks up the company, sell all of the real estate (at $140mn conservatively?), pays off the debt and you are left with a 35% loss assuming you don't get paid anything for present and future cash generation which is doubtful.

But it gets better. The CEO owns 17% of the company so his incentive to perform is there. The management team has expressed a willingness to CONTINUE their policy of buying back shares. In addition, the CEO has paid off debt and used new cheaper debt to open new clubs when it makes sense.  On top of that, during the most recent earnings call they talked about their plans to spin off the real estate into a REIT. I'm still fuzzy on the implications of this but I think at the very least this would save on taxes.

On a side note, they have no unionized employees. In fact, their biggest assets in that of the dancers (no pun intended) are not even employees in every state but one. Even though I have never been to one of these clubs, it seems that they are more professional, create better atmospheres and have better controls than other clubs of that ilk.

Of course there is the glaring fact that these are indeed strip clubs and remain unsavory to the general public. But the unloved industry is exactly why it is so cheap. There are other cons that could arise in the form in unexpected regulations and problems that could arise in specific venues. 

Overall I don't think people are ever going to stop going to adult clubs and RICK's can use their economies of scale to their advantage. They are also diversifying into more sports bar type restaurants.

**Background:** 

Altisource Portfolio solutions ""Altisource"" was spun off from Ocwen Financial in 2009. Ocwen financial is a mortgage servicer. Of all the mortgage servicers, Ocwen is the most cost efficient, best run, and best capitalized. As a mortgage servicer, Ocwen acquires mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Owners of MSRs collect a small fee from every mortgage payment it is servicing. Ocwen may service a mortgage by handling day to day tasks of servicing a loan, process payments, keep track of principal and interest paid, manages escrow accounts, initiate foreclosure, modify loan payments for subprime and delinquent loans and so on. 

The reason Altisource was spun off from Ocwen in 2009 is because Ocwen's Chairman Bill Erbey knew the software division of Ocwen was not being valued properly within the business. Altisource is now incorporated in Luxembourg for tax reasons but it basically does everything a United States company would do. It files with the SEC, gets audited and does almost all business in the United States. 

**Thesis:**

**What does Altisource do?**

From the 2013 10k-

 ""Altisource®, together with its subsidiaries, is a premier marketplace and transaction solutions provider for the real estate, mortgage and consumer debt industries offering both distribution and content. We leverage proprietary business process, vendor and electronic payment management software and behavioral science based analytics to improve outcomes for marketplace participants.""

If you figured out what they did from reading that, congratulations, because I couldn't. I own the company and I still do not know all of the services they provide. What I do know is that more than half of Altisource's revenue is derived from Ocwen. Ocwen uses Altiosurce's state of the art servicing technology to service their loans. Altisource's technology allows Ocwen to be such a low-cost servicer. Altisource only provides their technology to Ocwen and no other servicers. 

http://oraclefromomaha.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/1.png 

In the above link, you can see the ways Altisource generates revenue. The main thing to know here is that Altisource generates a huge portion of their revenue from Ocwen. When Ocwen makes less modifications on loans, they use Altisource's services less so Altisource makes less money. When Ocwen modifies more loans then Altisource makes more money because Ocwen uses their serivices more. It provides a hedge against parts of their business that may struggle in a recession like any other business. During the natural economic cycle if there is a recession and Ocwen is modifying more loans because more homeowners cannot make payments then Altisource is making more money than they would during good economic times because Ocwen uses their services more. The more MSRs Ocwen acquires, the more Altisource makes. 

**Ocwen's growth (basically a quick long thesis on Ocwen)**

When a bank loans money to an individual to buy a house, a mortgage is originated and an MSR is created. The bank then keeps the mortgage on its books or sells the mortgage to another entity. Perhaps Fannie or Freddie. But what happens to the MSR? The MSR is then sold to a servicer such as Nationstar, Walter Investment Management Corp, or Ocwen. The reason the banks or originator of the mortgage sell the MSR is because they cannot service it properly and/or they would lose money in the process of trying to service it. Because of Dodd Frank, banks are trying to get MSRs off their books even faster because they cannot service them efficiently as previously mentioned and because they will have to hold 250% more capital against the MSRs. All banks are moving away from owning MSRs and non-bank servicing is becoming a larger industry, and Ocwen is leading the way. Due to the high supply of MSRs that are wanting to be sold by banks the MSRs can currently be bought at a 20-30% yield. Ocwen can buy the most MSRs because they are the best capitalized and they use the most conservative balance sheet. Ocwen being the lowest cost operator provides them with a huge competitive advantage when bidding for MSRs as well. Ocwen will continue to lead the non-bank servicers in buying MSRs. Ocwen currently has $464 billion of unpaid principle balance of loans they are servicing and another trillion dollars of subprime (Ocwen specializes in subprime) UPB is expected to get into the hands of non bank servicers by 2018 (3-4 trillion in UPB of regular MSRs). Ocwen will get the most of that trillion dollars of UPB of any servicer because of their competitive advantages. 

Another competitive advantage of Ocwen is their relationship Home Loan Servicing Solutions Ltd. HLSS was also created by Bill Erbey. HLSS provides the capital for Ocwen to service loans so Ocwen does not have to tie up their capital. In the future, HLSS will acquire more loans and allow Ocwen to sub-service them through a unique financing strategy. This strategy called the accretion model is a genius way to get capital for HLSS to afford a virtually unlimited amount of MSRs. HLSS pays a huge dividend and because of this dividend, HLSS trades above its tangible book value due to fixed income hungry investors who want a fat dividend. HLSS then issues more shares above tangible book value to then acquire more MSRs. Issuing shares above book value actually creates value for HLSS shareholders also instead of diluting value as many people would think issuing shares does. Those MSRs are then sub-serviced by Ocwen, who still uses Altisource's technology. 

Ocwen is also getting into foreword and reverse mortgage origination so they can have a constant stream of MSRs.

Basically, Ocwen and HLSS are going to acquire more MSRs and Ocwen will be servicing more mortgages. More mortgages serviced by Ocwen = more revenue for altisource. 

All MSR transactions have currently been stopped by a New York financial regulator but we will get to that issue later.

**Share Repurchases**

Up until a few months ago the laws of Luxembourg restricted the amount of shares that Altisource could repurchase. Altisource recently created a foreign subsidiary that does nothing called ""MidCo"" to hold all other parts of the business so there would legally be no restrictions on share repurchases. Until Altisource did this, they were repurchasing the maximum amount of shares that Luxembourg would allow. 

Here is Altisource's entity structure to bypass Luxembourg share repurchase laws http://i.imgur.com/J6LPEc0.jpg

The highlighted dark blue entity will be the entity repurchasing unlimited shares because MidCo, its parent company is not in Luxembourg. How smart is that. 

Altisource currently authorized the repurchase of up to 2.9 million shares. 2.9 million shares is 13% of their market cap. They could easily repurchase that amount. Altisource also just finalized a loan with BAC for $200 million to repurchase shares so the share repurchases will really start to kick into high gear with the new liquidity and cheaper price. Up until the sharp share price drop, Altisource was repurchasing for the past several months around $110. That shows the board and management think the company is undervalued at $110 and now it is at $84 and nothing fundamentally changed about the company. 

**Insider Purchases**

During the past 6 months, 3 insiders have purchased at $102, $103, $106, and $120. Between 20% and 43% above current market prices. Bill Erbey also owns 30% of Altisource and 13% of Ocwen. His views are directly in line with other shareholders.

**Bill Erbey and his Capital Allocation**

Bill Erbey is the Chairman of Ocwen, Altisource Portfolio Solutions, Altisource Asset Management Corporation, Altisource Residential, and Home Loan Servicing Solutions. Bill has done a great job of creating shareholder value for Ocwen and Altisource shareholders. Bill has also greatly benefited from this because of his stakes in thise companies. Before the sharp share price drop due to outside forces, Bill compounded Ocwen's stock at 30% per year since 2002 WITHOUT including the Altisource spinoff which compounded itself since 2009 at almost 75% a year. Altisource then spunoff Altisource Residential and Altisource Asset Management. Every spinoff is a value creating machine. At one point AAMC had compounded 430% in a year and a half, although it was due to a stretched valuation. Bill is dedicated to doing whatever it takes to create shareholder value. He relocated to the Virgin Islands just to save Ocwen some money on taxes. 

I once read a story about Bill in his Virgin Islands home and his electric bill for the air conditioning. Keep in mind, Mr. Erbey is a multi billionaire. Bill got his electric bill and saw his costs had skyrocketed due to his air conditioning. Bill then sat there after that baking and sweating in the heat in his home so he could save a couple thousand on his electricity bill. He will do anything to save a dollar. 

**Hubzu**

Hubzu is owned by Altisource. Hubzu is currently an online marketplace to buy and sell foreclosed homes. Like Zillow and Trulia but for foreclosed homes. Hubzu takes foreclosed homes from Ocwen and lists them on their website Hubzu.com. Hubzu is trying to get into the non-distressed house listing like other real estate websites like Zillow and Trulia. This will grow Hubzu at an even faster rate. Altisource states Hubzu gets about 1 million unique new visitors per month. When you buy Altisource you are also buying the jewel of Hubzu. Bill Erbey claims that Hubzu makes ""as much money in one quarter as Zillow does in 4 quarters"" Zillow has a market capitalization of $5 billion. Zillow's market capitalization is definitely stretched but a spinoff would create a lot of shareholder value even if the market gave Hubzu a fraction of Zillow's valuation. 

**Why is the company undervalued?**

All this greatness in one company so why is it so undervalued? Remember how Altisource's earning were pretty much directly tied to how well Ocwen does? A New York State Financial Department regulator named Benjamin Lawsky halted a $2.7 bilion ($39 billion in UPB) Wells Fargo MSR transfer to Ocwen. This also halted all of the other MSR transactions between banks and servicers. Benjamin Lawsky is probing into Ocwen and other servicers. He states that he wants to make sure Ocwen and other servicers have the capacity to service loans efficiently because they are ""growing too fast"". The relationships these 5 companies share though is somewhat sketchy. They have a lot of the same board members and they all work with each other and make money off each other. Ocwen is the best servicer of them all though. They provide more loan modifications than anyone else and they have the lowest re default rate. 

A slide from an investor presentation shows how they compare to others http://i.imgur.com/YkIKD2O.png

Even if Lawsky did find that some servicers do not have the capacity to service loans then Ocwen would be the last one in question because it is easy to see they are doing the best for their consumer compared to anyone other servicer. 

Benjamin Lawsky is doing this for his own political reasons. He wants his name on the news. He wants people to see his name. Perhaps he wants to run for governor or something. Why would he schedule an interview with CNBC about the probe into the mortgage servicers right after it is announced. Why would he send a letter to Altisource and at the same time send it to the press, therefore ruining Altisource's reputation without giving them a chance to respond. He is also really into regulating bitcoin in New York which is just another vehicle to get his name in the news. 

There are very recent updates with the regulatory pressure and basically the probing is narrowed down to an issue with force placed insurance and Altisource. Ben Lawsky could not find anything else. He sent this letter on Aug. 4th to Ocwen. So this is what the probe is narrowed down to.  

http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press2014/pr140804-ocwen-letter.pdf

Basically, if a homeowner is struggling to make payments and can't pay their insurance, Ocwen has the right to force place insurance into their payments so the mortgage owner does not incur massive losses if a catastrophe happens. Ocwen has to outsource whoever force places the insurance and the issue that Ben Lawsky was worried about was why Altisource was appointed to find someone to force place that insurance, why Altisource received commission for basically doing nothing, and why Bill Erbey did not consult with any of the Ocwen board before making this decision to allow Altisource to find an insurer. 

Altisource will probably get a one time fine settlement and they will go on doing business as usual. I believe this because an almost identical situation happened with Assurant and the New York State Financial Department and they settled for $14 million. There is also an interview on CNBC with someone who talks to the CEO of Ocwen and they are sure that Ocwen and Altisource will just settle with a deal with Lawsky and that will be the end of it.

**Risks**
Benjamin Lawsky actually finds something else that Altisource was doing wrong. 
Bill Erbey Dies. He is in his 60s and overweight.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion Altisource is extremely cheap. Remember that quote about not knowing how much a man weighs but knowing he is fat? That is the case with Altisource. Altisource is definitely undervalued but there are a range of possibilities of the valuation with Hubzu, regulatory matters, growth, etc.

t3_2dd37b,easyhome (TSX:EH) Price target $33 (+35%),"Just spoke with an Analyst. He recently raised EH PT from 27 to $32.5. It's a small cap so this is def not for everyone and please do your own research and consult an investment advisor before investing (insert standard disclaimer stuff).

[Link to the research report](https://mega.co.nz/#!tVgX1BzC!PggH-ZM3Me5OE9rOkedx_LxQPxBA_CM1u7950hnCZZQ)

Easyhome operates 2 business lines: 

1) Leasing: rent to own furniture and electronics, 18% operating margin, expected to grow to low 20s%. Majority of the revenue

2) Financing: recently launched, unsecured loans in the $1k to $5k (for borrowers with credit thats not good enough for banks, but they are not desperate enough for pay-day loans). Operating margin in the low 30%, loan book currently growing 65% YoY. Financing is expected to help boost overall operating margins to mid-high 20%.

EH has very low debt. They recently secured a $200mm debt package (~40% Debt to total assets), which will help boost growth. 

The story is very compelling. The mezz debt market in Canada is small and the US banks abandoned their Canadian operations in 2008/2009 (i.e. Citi, Wells Fargo), thus leaving only EH to supply an underserved market. He doesnt think the Big 5 Canadian will enter the market due to the risk and strict capital requirements.

Valuation wise, we are looking at 18x P/E LTM vs peer 19.6x P/E. It's even cheaper for forward valuation (10x vs 21x peer).

If EH can successfully execute the expansion of easyfinancial and grow dividends/buybacks, the stock will have no problem getting to the $30s. 

The analyst drew parallels to Dollarama (the dominant Canadian dollar store). Dollarama had 0 debt, low dividends, high growth. Then the stock really popped when they started buying back shares and increasing dividends, went from $60 to $90 in a couple of months.

t3_2ffo15,Bank switch thesis BMO v. BAC,"Hi SA,

Referencing Graham's suggestion that head to head security analysis can sometimes yield more conclusive results than analyzing any individual security, I'm contemplating switching from BMO to BAC. 

I like to keep things simple. My reason would be to move to a security with a lower price to tangible book value. By my canculation, tangible book/share for BMO=41.64, for BAC 10.34 (MRQ). P/TB of 2.04 for BMO, 1.55 for BAC.

Implicit in my thesis is that large banks tend to invest in similar asset classes and offer similar services, suggesting that their future returns measured as returns on equity will likely be similar. Since 2008 US banks seem to have moved in a more conservative direction similar to Can banks. It then seems to follow that switching to a security which offers more equity/$ makes sense.

t3_2gmll2,Long Thesis for BBRY,"Blackberry is a provider of software, services and hardware primarily  targeted at enterprise clients. Market share has declined drastically  since the entrance of AAPL and GOOG into the space, and the Blackberry  OS has crumbled as an ecosystem. Lack of apps meant less users, which  discouraged developers from making apps, creating a vicious cycle. John  Chen, who turned around Sybase, replaced Thorsten Heins on November 4,  2013. Using a sum of the parts analysis, we value BBRY at around $12.7  bn, or $24/share, which represents a 130% upside from current prices.

We  believe that the hardware segment is worth around $1.9 bn. Losses were  severe for 2013, but inventory write offs meant substantially lower than  normal gross margins for the year. We believe that it is likely that,  with better inventory management, the results were one off and  non-recurring. Management has decided to partner with Foxconn to cut  costs, and focus more on niche areas like healthcare with their new  phones (the Passport). As of Q1 2014 margins have already shown drastic  improvement. We believe there is a potential for turnaround for the  hardware segment, at least to profitability. Motorola sold to Lenovo for  $3bn, which was 3x sales. Nokia sold their headset segment to Microsoft  for around $7 bn, which was around 0.5-1x sales. To be conservative, we  will apply the lower end of that range to 2013 sales which comes to  $1.9bn. We believe that BBRY hardware is worth at least that much to a  private buyer.

BBM has become a very valuable asset. Whilst the  number of users have decreased from around 200 mn at its peak to just 80  mn now, Blackberry is looking to turn this business around by releasing  BBM on iOS and Android. Social media and messaging apps are generally  valued by the number of users they have, and how valuable each user is.  The Whatsapp acquisition valued each user at around $40, whilst the  Viber acquisition valued each user at $8. It is important to note that  scale matters a lot for a messaging app, thus each user on Whatsapp, the  market leader, is valued at substantially higher prices than users on  competing apps. BBM is not a market leader, but the user base does  comprise of working professionals and government officials, which may be  worth more than each user on an app like Whatsapp or Viber. The prime  selling proposition for BBM is the fact that it is hosted by its own  network and so is secure and does not require a data plan for it to  function. To be conservative, we will take the lower end ($8) and  multiply by the number of users which is 80 mn, which comes to around  $630 mn, although we believe that it is potentially worth a lot more.

BES  and Services is the new focus of the company. It competes with IBM,  VMWare, Good and Mobile Iron amongst others in a highly fragmented and  competitive space. Whilst competitors are abundant, Blackberry is the  clear market leader with more customers than the closest 3 competitors  combined. BES and Services provides solutions and security for companies  and governments to manage employees’ mobile devices and apps. As  smartphones become more prevalent, this business will continue to grow.  Previously, services for Android and iOS users were lacking, but  Blackberry is looking to solve this issue with the release of BES 12.  John Chen has a background in enterprise, and we are very confident of  his leadership going forward.

No direct comps but start-ups in  the same industry have been acquired (AirWatch) or have IPO'd  (MobileIron) at 5+ x sales. Looking at 2013 figures, sales for the  segment comes to around 3 bn, and COGS at around 400 mn. Gross profit  for the segment comes to around 2.3 bn. We will apply a conservative 4x  multiple on gross profit, valuing this segment at $9 bn.

The  software segment is primarily composed of QNX. QNX was acquired by  Blackberry in 2009 for 200 mn. Currently it is primarily used in  automobiles but has been touted for use in a wide variety of industries  and situations including surgery (healthcare) and space travel. It is at  the heart of Blackberry’s venture into the internet of things, which  can be seen as a moon-shot (like many start ups), and as an option.

Revenue  for 2013 comes to around $200 mn. Considering the progress that has  been made in the past few years, and its potential, we cannot see QNX  being sold for anything less than $200 mn.

Last but not least, we  value BBRY’s patents at around $1 bn. In 2011 Apple, Microsoft,  BlackBerry, EMC, Ericsson, and Sony formed the “Rockstar” group to  purchase Nortel’s 6,000 patent portfolio for $4.5B or roughly $750K per  patent. The high price was undoubtedly due to market conditions at the  time. Blackberry has not monetized its patents to any great extent,  although Huawei has settled. Some sources cite Blackberry’s patents as  being worth $2 bn (The Numbers Behind BlackBerry’s Patent Goldmine -  Corporate Intelligence – WSJ), although we doubt it will ever be sold  for that much. We believe that $1 bn is a realistic estimate of the  portfolio’s true worth, which includes BBRY’s own patents.

In  conclusion we believe that BBRY can be very conservatively valued at  $12.7 bn. John Chen and management has already shown signs of turning  around the company after Q1 numbers were released. We believe the  company is being undervalued by the market due to a fundamental  understanding of what its main business is. The market believes that  BBRY is about its devices which in fact it is the BES segment which is  generating the bulk of its cash flow. John Chen has shown us a deep  understanding of the enterprise market, and we are very optimistic about  Blackberry’s outlook going forward.",5,0.62,1410924637,"[['AAPL', 1], ['GOOG', 1]]",AAPL,25.147499084472656,25.712499618530273
t3_2hjfz4,Aviation Industry / Airline Analysis / Copa Holdings,"I've been looking into Copa Holdings (CPA) for the last coulpe of weeks. 

CPA is a Panama based airline founded in 1947 and taken public in 2005. It is a leader in passenger and cargo airline service in Latin America. The company operates out of Panama City, location of its Hub of the Americas, and transports passengers across the entire continent with 280 daily flights. As of the close of Q2 2014, CPA operated a fleet of 93 aircraft, including 67 Boeing 737-Next Generation aircraft and 26 Embraer 190 aircraft. Its destinations range as far north as Montreal, Canada and as far south as Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pedro Heilbron (54 years old) has led the company since 1988, making him one of the longest tenured CEOs in the industry. CPA has had consistent earnings growth throughout the last 10 years. It is an industry leader in operational efficiency and punctuality (recent quarter on-time performance of 89.5% and a flight-completion factor of 99.8%). The company benefits from a several moats, including the location of its hub (Panama City is perfectly positioned at the midpoint of the Americas). CPA uses up almost 80% of the capacity in Tocumen International Airport, which is undergoing a substantial expansion set to be completed in 2016. The company's fleet is scheduled to grow in capacity at a 9% yearly rate in the next two years.

CPA's stock has suffered recently in light of its Venezuela troubles. A significant amount of CPA's cash (roughly $528MM out of a $1,150MM total) is trapped in Venezuela. The funds are subject to exchange controls in Venezuela and are pending repatriation. The political and economic instability has also forced the company to cut its capacity in the country in roughly 50%. Venzuela was CPA's most lucrative market in terms of margin. The issue, however, does not appear to present a liquidity problem for the airline. Added to this, there are fears that a similar situation could be cooking up in Argentina, though management assures the necessary precautions are being taken. 

I've never conducted a detailed analysis of an airline before, and I'm well aware that the industry has been demonized by value investors, including Buffet (""Investors have poured their money into airlines and airline manufacturers for 100 years with terrible results"").

Still, it feels as though this is a high quality business trading cheaply at a 9.15 PE, considering its solid track record, moat, and near term growth plans. Perhaps the Venezuela issues have caused the stock to be oversold.

Prosafe is a provider of semi-submersible accomodation vessels (refered to as SSAVs). These SSAVs are used in the offshore industry when big tasks require the crews to stay at sea for longer periods or when additional persons are required for a task. Prosafe owns 11 high quality SSAVs out of a global fleet of only 20 SSAVs making Prosafe the biggest player in the market. Prosafe is in the process of building several new SSAVs. 

 Prosafe is headquartered in Cyprus but listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker ""PRS"". 

Before I continue with the analysis I have a word for the readers. This is my first published analysis and English is not my first language therefore you have to expect some grammatical mistakes. Please bear with me. Since I'm a novice security analyst, I hope that you will provide some constructive feedback or advices to my ongoing journey of becoming an expert security analyst. Everything from suggesting books that I should read to raising question about the analysis is very welcome. With that said. Let's begin. 

**The numbers**

Looking at the numbers we see a solid company. Good earnings, high solvency, high margins and so forth. We also see low valuation metrics indicating that the company might be undervalued. It certainly looks undervalued to me. 

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/W1Oh2sT.png)

Insiders, including the CEO and CFO, have acquired shares in the last couple of months which supports my belief that the company is undervalued at the current price.

**Dividend**

Prosafe's dividend policy is very shareholder friendly. They aim to pay out up to 75% of net income. At the current market price Prosafe yields ~11%. This yield is very nice for the dividend minded investor, but keep in mind that the dividend might get a cut in the future either due to lower earnings (see the risk section) or because additional capital is needed for the current process of building more SSAVs. 

 The image below provides a historical overview of the dividend (in norwegian kroner - NOK) and the payout ratio.  

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/GVytGUa.png)

**Prosafe and the price of oil**

Because Prosafe operates in the oil business I suspected a link between the price of oil and the shareprice. I decided to take a look at the relationship between the two (see the picture below).

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/nLRggQ3.png)

As you can see they are closely related and the recent drop in the price of oil is the main reason why Prosafe's share price has dropped 30% from 3 month high. The earnings also share some degree of sensitivity to oil price. The earnings are not as sensitive as the share price because Prosafe rents out the SSAVs on long term contracts. 

**Catalysts**

The share price, and to some degree the earnings, are closely linked to the price of oil. This implies that a higher oil price (say, 100$/barrel) would without a doubt push the share price up. Probably a lot. This makes an investment in Prosafe a play on oil.

Prosafe has historically traded in a band between P/E5 and P/E12 (as illustrated in the image below) and is nearing the lower band. I expect that higher oil prices would revalue the share at around P/E8 to P/E10. The analyst estimates for next years earnings are 7,2 NOK (1.1$ optained via 4-trader.com times the current USDNOK of 6,56) per share which - combined with a revaluation due to higher oil price - should push the share price to around 57,6 - 72 NOK. An upside of 67%-108%.

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/9W58DFN.png)

**Risks**

By investing in Prosafe you're going to face two major risks which can hurt earnings in the coming years.

1) The oil price stays at the current level or falls further.

2) The demand for SSAVs falls drastically due to new supply in the next three years. Over the next two-three years the global supply of SSAVs is going to increase by ~60%. Prosafe is the biggest player in the market and has a clear competitive advantage but is probably still going to suffer to some degree from this increase in supply. 

**Summary and closing word**

Prosafe's fat yield combined with the solid earnings history and strong financial position is hard to come by. There are however several risks in the coming time. Lower oil prices and/or the increased demand of SSAVs can hurt earnings and yield during the next couple of years and push the share price even lower than it is today. 

Given their strong financial position, their economics of scale and competitive advantage I have no doubt that Prosafe will weather the coming demand storm and continue as a succesful company (with a substanially higher share price). In my opinion Prosafe looks like a solid oil play for the dividend minded investor who thinks that oil at 80$/barrel is temporary.

t3_2khhje,DCF Analysis - Need a bit of help.,"So recently I was lucky in receiving an interview for a firm, and they asked me to pitch a stock. Realized I had a fairly hard time justifying my case with simply qualitative analysis and looking at key ratios and figured this would be the best place for me to ask questions. I only have a few days to submit this as well, and having relatively no finance background has me scrambling all over the place for answers.

Stock I picked is a semiconductor company, with relatively high growth, but trailing P/E, P/S does not seem too convincing. Analysts for some reason or another though, rate it a strong buy.

1. Trailing P/E is currently 3x of Forward P/E, what could possibly be the reasons for that? Is it simply that earnings are to increase 3x if price were to stay stable? Which P/E is the proper valuation ratio to use?

2. I've watched quite a few videos and read a few things on how to construct a DCF model. It seems that earning per share, and FCFF are used to predict future cash flows. I'm looking at the company's financial records and while Revenues have been consistently been increasing from quarter to quarter, cash flows have not been stably growing quarter to quarter (although they have been increasing YtoY so far). How do I predict future growth given that?

3. Just in general, anything else I should know when constructing a simple DCF model? What to avoid doing, common mistakes, things to highlight in regards to sensitivity tables (esp. how to calculate discount rates).

Sorry for this long post, just trying to jam everything in my head as it is under the time pressure and I realize I may sound a bit stupid. If anyone could volunteer to help me with this, I'd really appreciate it!

The Engineering investment case is becoming a very attractive deep value trade with potential upsides of 50% and low risks. 
  
Background and Sector specifics

Engineering is a major Italian information technology group which provides services such as software solutions, IT infrastructure, and business expertise on a global level (although 85% of its revenues are still derived in Italy). The group is organized around four main market divisions: PA (government) and Healthcare (31.7%), Utilities and Telco (28.9%), Industries & Services (22.2%), and Finance (17.3%). The company has a market cap of 520m euros, employs over 7,200 employees and achieved revenues of 823m in 2013(6.9% YoY growth) a 6.6% EBIT margin.
 
 
ENG has 3 main revenue streams: System Integration & Consulting, Outsourcing, and Proprietary licences and fees.

System Integration & Consulting

Characterised by contracts lasting less than one year, focus on providing IT services on enterprise content management (content, workflow and knowledge management). They also consult in areas such as organisation governance and people management. These areas of revenue offer higher profitability compared to outsourcing contracts due to the higher value of service provided and the nature of the price structure (turn-key contracts).

Outsourcing, Application Management, and Cloud Services		
Managed Operations Department provides clients with a full offering of Outsourcing Services thanks to a highly Technological Centre located in Pont Saint Martin. IT infrastructure is also based on Torino, Padua, Milan, Vicenza and Rome sites. Despite lower profitability in this area, outsourcing guarantees more visibility thanks to longer contracts (5-7 years) and c80% of contract value is made of a fixed amount. Outsourcing is anti-cyclical: in economic downturns and firms need to further improve their cost structure, they prefer to outsource IT services or computerize manual processes. 

Proprietary licences and fees 

ENG can rely on more than 200 proprietary solutions spanning from a CRM suite for utilities to compliance and governance software for banks. The offer of proprietary software is characterized by high profitability and strong customer retention (high barrier to entry depending on whether the software is recognised as market leader).
 
The market ENG operates in is concentrated around 5 players (IBM, Accenture, HP, Microsoft, Engineering) counting for a combined market share of nearly 42%. It is important to note that in an economic downturn firms tend to cut IT spending first. Thus, the Italian ICT market has seen a reduction in consumer spending since 2007. However after 7 years of market decline, Assinform forecasts an increase in overall spending by 0.6% in 2014.  Engineering claims that it has benefited from sector decline as it grabbed a larger relevant market share, up around 300bps to 11.5%.
ENG is a services company, 91% of its costs are made up of Personnel costs and the cost paid to 3rd party suppliers. Due to the heavy variable cost structure, the ability to improve margins is mostly derived through increasing labour productivity and efficiency, as well as reducing prices paid to suppliers. The business is also slightly seasonal; the first half of the year consists of around 48% of revenues. Typically, increases/decreases in spending see a delay of 6/12 months to GDP changes due to the nature and length of an IT project.

The Opportunity

Negative market sentiment in Europe seems to have influenced ENG’s price:  since its peak in April €54 the stock has dropped by 31% to €37, trading at 10.6x 2014 P/E. Yet the company fundamentals have stayed consistent over this period. Q1 results were weak (Ebit down 20% yoy to €10m) and the price drop might have reflected this. However, these results were in line with management expectations, taking into consideration the integration process of the company Engineering.mo (ex T-Systems Italia) and the consolidation of the newly-acquired company MHT. We can safely say there were no fundamental issues. In the meantime we have seen a recovery of margins, top line growth and a positive net financial position. Results in H1 are reflective of a solid business with potential to benefit from international expansion, or a share buyback with the cash that has been generated. Top line growth was 3% yoy, Ebit grew 7.6% to €33.9m and Ebit margins also improved by 50bps to 8.6%. Improvements in Public Administration payment times led to an increase in the net financial position by 15.9% to €45.2m.
Engineering stock is artificially depressed: On top of the overbearing market forces, we are expecting Bestinver to sell its 10% stake in Engineering after the departure of Francisco Garcia Parames as fund manager. Bestinver is facing 5billion euros in redutions to its AUM and will most likely begin to sell off its positions to liquidate. Market reaction to this news has led to further de-rating of the stock as people anticipate the selloff.  

Margins: Are they sustainable?

Given its capital returns (21.8%), operating history (12.3% CAGR 2000-2013) and international growth prospects, Engineering’s current valuation is only justifiable if (1) margins begin to fall off or (2) large amounts of receivables are written off. In the first case we would be looking at future increases in costs and/or severe deflation in the prices clients pay for the services ENG provides. This would also suggest ENG loses pricing power in its market. Second, Engineering holds a large amount of receivables on its books (€552m as of H1 2014). The risk here is that clients default on the debt owed and Engineering is forced to write off large proportions of its balance sheet. In this section we will explain why these 2 main risks are not significant enough to make up for the recent movements in the stock price. 


Trade Receivables risk

At face value the Trade Receivables situation that Engineering is facing does not look good. I would definitely consider this the biggest risk the company faces in the next 2-3 years. The Group claims that the type of operations justifies the high amount of receivables, such as the proportion due from the public administration, contractual durations. Trade receivables are all due within 12 months. However, the biggest issue here is the amount of receivables that are overdue. These have increased by 37.6% to €265m. Moreover, almost 30% of receivables are overdue by 120 days meaning the debtor hasn’t paid in 16 months. Yet most of the increase in overdue receivables has come from doing business with the Italian government. The Group has indicated that government bodies often do not respect the conditions established by contracts, but this does not result in irrecoverable receivables. In other words, even though the government is extremely slow at paying Engineering, they do not expect the debt to be defaulted.
The problem of overdue receivables is reflected in the dispute with the Region of Sicily over almost €100m, which has been ongoing for over 2 years.  After speaking to management about the problem they have emphasised that they are confident they will be paid. Their auditors are not in the condition to ask Engineering to write off the credit, implying a high grade of confidence in getting payment back. Another notable positive: there are expected future improvements to payments terms from Public Administration due to the European Late Payment Directive; imposing members of the EU to pay their private suppliers within 60 days. These changes would lead to further cash flow improvements.

Benefits from a positive NFP

Since ENG is cash positive (45.2m, 16% yoy increase) the options for share buy backs, increase in dividends and also growth through international acquisitions are all likely. In 2014 we are expecting a 7.6 cents dividend payout, which has increased from 6.5 cents in 2013. In addition, management has clearly mentioned that “we are plainly aware of the under-evaluation of our company meaning we can invest some of our cash in buying back shares”. The half year report has confirmed that the shareholders have voted in favour of a share repurchase plan for a maximum of 2.5m shares, within a maximum time frame of 18 months.  Engineering has 12.5m outstanding shares, so the share buyback policy could lead to 20% of shares being repurchased. This is a highly significant figure, and it is great news to know the company is this confident that the shares are undervalued. Once the company begins to repurchase shares, this should further restore market confidence. The belief that the stock is undervalued is certainly prevalent within the company. Chairman Michele Cinaglia has recently engaged in buying over €800,000 of shares over the months of August and September using his personal wealth. 
Management says they are evaluating investments abroad, which so far have proved to be the strongest sources of growth, and are convinced that geographical expansion will be one of the key points of success.

t3_2mhqhc,Analysis of a norwegian medical equipment supplier,"Medistim. Ticker MEDI @ Oslo stock exchange

The business:

The Norwegian company Medistim is in the business of developing, servicing, leasing and distributing medical devices. It specializes in technology for measuring blood flow, typically during heart surgery.
 
The main products are the VeriQ and the VeriQC. They also have a new machine called the MeriQ, but it is not yet approved in all markets, so it will not have much influence on this analysis.
These devices use ultrasound probes to precisely measure blood flow through blood vessels ensuring quality during surgery and giving the surgeon enhanced precision. This correlates positively with reduced chances for complications during and after surgery.
The company’s latest machine, the VeriQC, combines this technology with ultrasound imaging, further enhancing the functionality for the surgeons. According to the company, this is the only device in the market with this technology.
the technology can also be useful for other procedures, like organ transplants, and locating stenosis in blood veins (stenosis is a fancy word for unwanted narrowings)

By increasing the quality of surgery the company offer the hospitals higher efficiency during operations, lower costs due to lower need for re-interventions, and in the US, probably a few less lawsuits.

The product is cleared for sale in all the major markets, as Europe, USA and Japan.

The market:

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the western world, and also an increasing cause in regions now adopting a western lifestyle such as several countries in  Africa and Asia.
There is s about 700 000 bypass-surgeries and 600 000 vascular procedures world wide on an annual basis. 

The largest market is the US, where about 33% of all by-pass procedures are carried out.

Medistims equipment have received recommendations as ""standards of care"" by several  respected european and british cardiology societies, and medistim hopes this will influence clinical practise in other markets, such as the US.

USA
80% of all by-pass surgeries in the US is performed without any other means of assuring blood flow than the surgeon using his/her finger to feel the pulse in the blood vessels.
So far, Medistim has a market penetration of about 13% of the total 240 000 by-pass surgeries performed in the US annually.

Medistim has developed a unique business model for the us market, where they place the machines at the hospitals free of charge, and the hospital has to pay-per-procedure by purchasing smartcards that activates the machine for one surgery pr smartcard. Not unlike  going to a carnival where you buy tokens so your children can ride the carousels.
The reason for this is the insurance system in the US, giving a more specified cost pr procedure for the hospital bills. This also avoids the barrier of making a large investment before the machine can be put to use.
If a hospital wishes to buy the machine, they are free to do so, as is common in most other parts of the world.
A part of the commercial strategy for the US is ,in addition to regular sales, lobbying towards the cardiac societies to make the technology of medistims machines ""standards-of-care"" in the US.

Europe:

In europe it is common for the hospitals to buy the machines, as the focus on cost per procedure is not that relevant, and many hospitals are required by policy to own their equipment.
they do however need to purchase the different probes and consumables for the machines, this is medistims largest source of revenue.
The VeriQC system have received praise from influential sources in the UK , but there are only few installations.
Germany is the largest market in europe with about 60 000 by-pass surgeries annually.

Asia, Latin America, The middle east and other markets:

There is a general increase in the focus on cardiac diseases  in Asia and Latin America, and there is also a rise in the number of procedures as these countries adopt a western lifestyle, so presence here is important for the company.
In Asia, Japan, is the biggest customer base as of now, with about 65% of the sales in the region, but there has also been good growth in China.
In Latin America Brazil is the country with the largest potential for Medistims products. In the Middle East and Africa, Medistims latest product, VeriQC, has been well received, led by Saudi-Arabia.

Is the company profitable?

Yes the company is profitable. 
It’s actually highly profitable in relation to the capital employed in the business. 


Some definitions:
As the numerator i use operating profits, since we want to look at the core profitability of the business.

To exclude the effects of leverage I use capital employed. More spesifically, working capital + tangible assets, and i also include R&D since a big part of this companys strategy is to continue to develop their product. Goodwill is excluded.

With this as my starting point, the return on capital employed I get is an impressive 21,2%

If I exclude all intangibles I get 59% but I don’t think that is relevant, since the R&D of their systems is such a vital part of their future business. 
Between 2003 and 2013 the company has had an EBIT growth of about 16%compounded annually 
In 2013 the company’s divident payout was 51,9% of earnings. The divident has been growing about 13% annually since 2006, excluding 2014 , where the divident was reduced in relation with developing the 4th generation system MeriQ

Is the business  stable?

I would think so. I assume that most heart attacks in the general population  are unrelated to macro-economic events, although I would be inclined to believe that you might see an increase in incidents among traders in bear markets. 
On a long, long term however I think we will see a declining trend of cardiac incidents in the western world, as lifestyle related diseases are gaining focus. This may be offset by the other countries adopting western habits.


Competitive advantage, market position?

I reckon that the technology can be reproduced by other companies. If there exists a competitive advantage for these machines I suspect it will be high switching costs, probably not money, but time.
I am no expert in this area, but I expect that using a machine like this takes some practice and familiarisation before It performs optimally for the surgeon, and that surgeons and clinics familiar with the setup and handling of this machine will be reluctant to change systems, and spend time and resources on familiarisation with a new product if the competing product does not offer huge advantages.

If this advantage really do exist, as their high return on capital indicates, it will be essential for Medistim to maintain their R&D spending, and keep on the cutting edge of the technology, or they will probably be marginalized by competitors.
They are the market leader with this technology, having a global penetration of about 23%. Competitors have about 7% so there is still 70% of the global market available
As of now, they are the only company with machines that offer both measurement of flow, and ultrasound imaging.
The company is in the process of launching its 4th generation system, the MiraQ.

The revenue:

Aftermarket probes is the key revenue component. This is not bad news if you ask me, having a strong aftermarket as the base for revenue.

As one would assume, selling these machines is not like selling candy, and takes some time. And even though machine sales is not a the biggest source of revenue, it is key to the “aftermarket” probe sales, so when the company books a machine sale, it also books a recurring revenue stream, wich is always nice.

Third party sales is also a large part of the revenue. This seems to be because of the relatively larger market penetration in the north european markets, where this is a necessary service to maintain profitability. The third pary products are, according to the company, carefully chosen to fit the same customer base as the ultrasound systems.

Is the balance sheet clean?

The balance sheet is rock solid as far as I can see. The company has virtually no debt (equity is 69% of total assets) and a solid cash position. quick ratio=1,85. Their biggest liability is Tax and social liabilities.

There are not many tangible assets though, but I think this reflects the nature of the business, as it is capital light.

Do they generate cash?

Yes. Plenty. Although they periodically use a lot of it to develop their systems, they generally generate a lot of cash.

Is there anything I don’t like about this company?

Yes, of course, there always is

– In the 2013 annual report there was a substansial increase in accounts receivables. Now this might be troublesome, as it may indicate that the company is pushing product to agressivly, or loosening credit terms to book sales. I consider this a warning sign that is worth monitoring closely if an investment were to be made in this company. The receivables have been reduced some in the second quarter 2014, which is a good sign, but I would keep an eye on this

-Since the company operates in different markets, it uses currency hedges to reduce exposure to fluctuations. I am no expert in financial derivatives, but I would wish the mechanics of the contracts were described in more detail it the statements so it would be easier to understand the true nature of them. I know that currency hedges is commonly used by companies with operations in different regions, so for now I am willing to assume that they are of a normal nature, but I make a note to myself to increase my knowledge of currency hedges

-although the company has been growing impressively in the past, this is no guarantee that they will be able to do so in the future. A lot seems to be dependant on the US market, and should the technology become standards-of-practice in the US, I bet you would see  competition rizing in the blink of an eye.

The company has an impressive return on capital, which indicates competitive advantage, but it also has a staggering divident payout ratio. This indicates that the company can not reinvest all of its earnings in a profitable way. Now I know that earning too much sounds like a luxury problem, But the current situation makes it difficult for the company to create wealth for a new shareholder. The stock is priced at a level where they should not buy shares (in my opinion) and it’s also priced at a level that does not offer a very nice divident yield. I think this explains why the stock has not been moving much the last few years.  As I see it this stock is a low risk, low paying investment with a potential for something bigger.

So what is it worth?

Now this is where it gets problematic. I have done a series of valuations using different techniques to try to put an estimate on my assessment of fair value. I was surprised of the relatively low fair value spread i got between my calculations.

My assessment of fair value is 18-24NOK.

This is below the current stock price of 26NOK, and leaves no margin of safety.

So why is this problematic? Well these estimates is my assessment of the fair value of the stock, as it is today, But it does not in any way include the growth potential that would be available if the companys technology should become standards-of-practice in the US. I also do not know how their recent approval in Russia will pan out. I have a nagging sensation that my estimates are too conservative, but I have no reasonable way to know without opening the door for pure speculation. For example; what do I know about lobbying in the US health care industry? absolutely nothing.

I could ofcourse change my required return rates, and growth estimates until I received a higher fair value, but I don’t want to go there.

There are some aspects of this company that makes me want a discount before considering investing, In particular i mention the rise on accounts receivables, my lacking understanding of the currency hedges and uncertainty about growth prospects.  There are also several aspects of the company that makes me want to be an owner.

I will keep an eye on this company, and should the price fall I probably will be a buyer, I might even initiate a small tracking position, but I fear that this will be “one that got away”

t3_2shmjm,VRS - Verso Company,"Commentary - I'm really new to this and have little understanding of the paper business or the effects of energy prices on the company (which from my limited understanding, lower prices should increase profitability).

Analysis:

Verso and NewPage create paper products (an industry in decline).

I read the news that there was a merger involving Verso Paper buying out NewPage.  A number of things stuck out at me from the beginning - how does the #2 company in an industry buy out the #1 company if the #2 company isn't making any money?  What was particularly striking to me was that both companies showed a loss for the past few years in an industry that was on the decline.  In particular, both companies were losing money so why bother in the first place?  I spent a few hours digging through the documents to try to understand the point of the merger.

After digging, I emerged with a better understanding of the deal.  To call it Verso acquiring NewPage misses the entire nature of the transaction.  It would be better considered as NewPage acquiring Verso and the bond holders taking a haircut to produce a financially viable company.  It's really a bankruptcy and consolidation all rolled into one deal.  Since NewPage is much larger than Verso, looking at the history of Verso is beyond useless.

The basic premise of my valuation is this: NewPage + Verso creates a company with EBITDA of $419M and a debt service (at rates above 12%) of ~$122M per year.  Even if both companies gain exactly zero efficiency on the deal, the merger has created a company that adequately covers it's debt service.  The nature of the business is cyclical and decreasing over time, but I don't expect that management of this company predicts that they will be out of business in under 4 years.

So now we are evaluating a company with $3.5B in revenue, earnings after debt service of $300M per year and leveraged up to the gills.  The chance of default is somewhat lowered - it would be tough to imagine conditions that result in a 2/3 reduction in earnings.  Of course the leverage produces an interesting situation of heads stockholders win, tails bondholders lose.

On the face of it, the merger has created a conservatively leveraged business in a declining industry.  The stakeholders are previous bond holders that probably don't desire to own a paper mill company or shareholders in NewPage that just got a huge cash payout.  I would imagine that this company is under huge selling pressure and the actual value isn't readily apparent.

Value pros:  
Conservative leverage  
Shareholders are motivated to dump shares - many were owners of NewPage that just got cash payouts or bondholders  
High debt to equity ratio  
Capitalization is currently at $200M - too low for institutional investors  
P/E ratio is currently less than 1  
Declining industry  

Value cons:  
No insider buys - management paid in cash  
Ownership by Apollo management  
Management's stated purpose is debt paydown then diversification  
Industry in decline at around 3% per year  
Cyclical indistry  

The kicker:
If the company makes money, they can multiply that return by buying their own debt at $0.60 on the dollar.  
If they exceed expectations, all they need to do is continue paying down debt to continue growth for a few years.

Long Yahoo = 0.4 shares of SpinCo  AND 1 share of RemainCo

SpinCo = BABA * (SpinCo discount)

So Long Yahoo = 0.4 BABA * (SpinCo Discount) + RemainCoStub

Add a short BABA to the equation to take out that volatility

(43.73) - (0.4 * 89.81) = (0.4 * 89.81)(SpinCoDiscount) + RemainCo Stub

$7.81 = SpinCo Discount + RemainCo Stub

$7.81 - SpinCo Discount = RemainCo Stub

The idea is that you are buying $20 of RemainCo intrinsic value (that $20 will vary depending on what you value YHOO at) for $7.80 + whatever SpinCo discount will be in dollar terms.

The past year was a great reminder of the famous Warren Buffet quote, ""Price is what you pay. Value is what you get"".  Stock prices often deviate greatly from fundamentals.  In the case of GLN, the stock had precipitously declined from $20 in 2013 to a low of less than $10.  The details of why this occurred can be found in my previous post.  However, the underlying thesis (value) remained in tact and this year the company was purchased at an all time high valuation of $26.50 by BCE and Rogers.  In fact, if you account for the deal terms proposed by BCE, the value is currently closer to $30/sh.  This represents a return of over 25% compounded annually since my first post.

AutoCanada had a rather volatile year, reaching a high of over $90 to a low of almost $30.  Despite this decline, investors have still been privileged to an 85% compounded annual return since my first post.  Reviewing the year, it is clear the at its peak, ACQ was significantly over valued.  At $90, investors were pricing in more then a reasonable pace of acquisitions as well as giving the underlying dealerships valuations that were well in excess of its US peers.  Today, at $41, I believe the stock represents good value.  The company now trades at a discount to its US peers and the company valuation better represents the known dealer acquisitions presented by management.  The caveat to all this remains the outlook for the Western Canadian auto market (where ACQ still has considerable concentration).  In the short term, autosales may slow for 2015 as the western market deals with the oil price shock.    However, long term the original thesis remains in tact and investors should look at the current situation as an opportunity to average into the stock throughout 2015.

The past year for Exchange Income Fund demonstrated the value of good management teams.  The team at EIF appropriately decided to sell their ownership of West Tower to none other than Maztec (mentioned in the previous post).  Despite managements difficulties with running this business, they managed to sell it at a considerable profit (over 2x what they paid).  I was pleased with the decision (and somewhat shocked at the price MTZ paid) but still question managements ability to successful invest shareholder capital.  Since I first wrote about the company, the stock price has declined 3.9% a year only to be offset by its 7% dividend.  As a result, investors have still received a 3% total return.  Unfortunately, this is still too low given the alternatives provided by significantly lower risk investments.  

For those who have found these past 3 infrequent posts interesting, please comment.  For the next 3 years, I have identified another 3 non-resource Canadian investments that I will write about in the coming weeks.

t3_2w2upj,Let's take a look at Yara International (my second analysis) [xpost from r/investing],"**Introduction**

Yara International (from hereon referred to as ""Yara"" or ""the company"") is a Norwegian company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker YAR. Yara's main business area is the production of fertilizers used in the agricultural industry. The main focus is on nitrogen-based fertilizers, however, Yara also produces phosphate-based fertilizers and potassium-based fertilizers. Yara's other business areas includes the production of dry ice, nitrates, ammonia, urea and other nitrogen-based chemicals. Yara is the world's largest supplier of plant nutrients. 

The biggest shareholder is the Norwegian government which owns 36,2% of the shares.

[One year price development](http://i.imgur.com/6goVMAc.png)

*Before I continue with the analysis I have a word for the readers. This is my second published analysis (you can read the first one [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2jvq8v/lets_take_a_look_at_prosafe_my_first_analysis/)) and English is not my first language. Therefore you have to expect some grammatical mistakes. Please bear with me. Since I'm a novice security analyst, I hope that you will provide some constructive feedback or advices to my ongoing journey of becoming an expert security analyst. Everything from suggesting books that I should read to raising question about the analysis is very welcome. With that said. Let's begin.*

**Yara in a macroeconomic setting**

Yara's earnings are highly dependent on the state of the agricultural industry which is a cyclical industry. This makes Yara a cyclical company. Looking at the numbers through a cycle (see ""The numbers"" section) shows that Yara is dependent on the cycle, as you would expect of a cyclical company, but can handle being in the bottom of a cycle without experiencing financial distress.

 At the present moment Yara is thriving due to high USD/NOK exchange rate and low gas prices. The exchange rate benefits Yara because of the increased competitivenes a weakened currency brings. 

 The lower natural gas price is essential to Yara because the production of (nitrogen) fertilizers requires massive amounts of natural gas. A further reduction (or just a non-increase) in the price of natural gas is a major potential catalyst for increased earnings in 2015. 

 In the long term, Yara has a positive exposure to several megatrends. The megatrends that are going to benefit Yara are:

* Higher population and higher food demand - This is obvious since Yara is producing fertilizers used to increase crop yield.
* Higher urbanization - Fewer farmers are going to supply food to a growing urban population. Effective fertilizers are essential if you want to have enough food in the future urbanized world. 
* Focus on climate changes - Yara is highly focused on sustainability and is commited to creating a sustainable agriculturial industry and provide green solutions for farmers.
* Resource scarcity - The fertilizers increases crop yield and less water (and other scarce resources) are needed for food production. 

**Moat**

As the world's largest producer of plant nutrients, Yara has a clear production cost advantage through economics of scale.

 Being the world's largest producer of plant nutrients, Yara has developed a strong brand worldwide. Yara is especially known for producing high quality products and for being focused on sustainability.

**The numbers**

I want to start this section with a review of the 10 year financial results. 

[Ten year summary](http://i.imgur.com/gKnCxq4.png)

 As can be seen in the picture above, Yara has had strong growth in revenue and earnings over the last ten years. The balance sheet has also strengthened significantly over this period of time. The increase in NIBD from 2013-2014 is a result of two recent acquisitions. Even after this new debt, Yara remains solid with a debt/equity of 64,26% and high solvency (see solvency number under the ""Competition"" section). 

 Looking at the fertilizer sales per region shows that Yara is diversified across most of the globe. This prevents adverse economic developments in one part of the world (droughts, floods, war etc.) from bankrupting Yara. Europe and Latin America are the biggest markets. 

[Fertilizer sales by region](http://i.imgur.com/ujVLDKn.png)

 As stated in the introduction, Yara is diversified across different products. The picture belows shows the production volumes of Yara's products. Nitrogen products make up a big part of the production volume which makes Yara highly dependent on natural gas prices. 

[Production volumes](http://i.imgur.com/lWa7tD3.png)

**Management in short**

The CEO of Yara International, Torgeir Kvidal, has a long history in Yara International. He started as trainee in 1991 (back then Yara was a part of Norsk Hydro) and has advanced internally reaching CFO in 2012. He held this position until October 2014 where he was appointed CEO. One of Torgeir Kvidal's predecessors in the CEO role (Thorleif Enger who left in 2008) was involved in a corruption scandal involving Yara's foreign activities. Torgeir Kvidal does not strike me as a kind who will follow in the shoes of Thorleif Enger and engage in these kinds of activities. He answers question straight up and he seems like a person of integrity who is not going to sweep scandals and illegalities under the rug. 

 Reading through transcripts from earning calls and public statements, all members of the management seem to abide by Yara's ""Ambition, Trust, Accountability and Teamwork""-culture.

**Dividend and share buyback**

Yara's dividend policy is to pay out at least 30% of earnings as dividends. Yara had to cut dividends from 13NOK to 10NOK in 2013 due to lower earnings but it has been raised back to 13NOK in 2015. The current dividend yield is at 3,12% (with a current price of 417 NOK). The dividend has increased 20,93% per year annualized.

[Graph of dividends and payout ratio](http://i.imgur.com/DG3LgOR.png)

 Yara also has a buyback policy in place to return more cash to shareholders. Yara aims to return 40-45% of net income through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. 

**Competition**

The following four companies are also operating in the plant nutrient field and are used for comparison.

* CF Industries produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizers and other nitrogen products. Yara and CF Industries recently talked about merging but it fell through.
* The Mosaic Company produces fertilizers mainly from phosphate. 
* Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan produces and sells fertilizers and related products to the agricultural industry. 
* Agrium produces, retails, and distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, seeds, and agronomics.

[Competition vs. Yara](http://i.imgur.com/4163oLG.png)

 Looking at the numbers, Yara looks the best of the bunch due to a solid financial position and high dividend yield combined with the best RoC of the bunch. RoE is only mediocre but this is mainly a result of lower leverage.

**Risks**

Yara is very dependent on the agricultural industry. A slowdown in the cyclical agricultural industry will hurt Yara. 

 Yara is highly dependent on the price of natural gas. Right now Yara is thriving because of the fall in the price of gas but a new rally could hurt Yara. I expect that Yara will lock in the current, favorable prices or hedge against a rally over the short-mid term, but eventually an increase in natural gas prices will hurt Yara.

**Valuation**

I am going to do a relative valuation of Yara compared to its competitors and a dividend discount model to reach a valuation. 

[Relative valuation](http://i.imgur.com/LFsTFfI.png)

 Looking at all three multiples, Yara looks undervalued compared to its competitors. Yara's strong numbers combined with Yara's strong moat suggests that a higher valuation could be justified. I could see Yara being valued at 17-18 times FY2014 earnings (469-497 NOK / upside of 12-19% excluding dividend) if the strong Q4 results continues in 2015.

Assumptions for DDM:

* Three stage DDM model
* High growth for 5 years with dividend growth of 10% per year
* Transition period for 3 years
* Stable period with dividend growth of 3% per year
* Cost of equity of 9,49%. Calculated using Damodaran's method

Everything taken into account these numbers are fairly conservative and provide a good base case valuation. The result of the DDM is a fair price of 462 NOK equal to a P/E of 17 and an upside of 12%. 

**Summary and recommendation**

Yara International is a strong, healthy company thriving in the current economic environment. The future looks bright for the company, especially in the long term, due to exposure to several megatrends. Yara is thriving right now due to a high dollar and low gas prices. This has sparked a rally in the stock price over the last year and the company is currently trading at a P/E around 15 with a dividend yield at just over 3%. Looking at a relative valuation, the stock still looks slightly undervalued compared to its competitors and a conservative DDM supports this conclusion.

 My recommendation:

 Long term investors looking for a great companies at a reasonable prices can start accumulating at the current price. 

 People looking for great value opportunities can add to watchlist and buy on any pullback/correction.

*DISCLAIMER: I am a novice security analyst and even though I have worked on this analysis for quite some time, there is no doubt that I have overlooked something important. I advice you to do your own due dilligence before investing in Yara International.*

t3_2wdd6w,What am I missing with Lee Enterprises?,"I came across this company and it seems cheap as it trades lower than peers in addition to a great FCF yield. It has a tremendous debt load from a failed acquisition of Pulitzer in 2005. However, I and the investor in this article (which I will link in the comments), believes the company can use the FCF to pay down their debt load by 2023. The company declared bankruptcy in 2011, and reemerged in 2012. I do not think the market is taking into account that a) it is a newspaper company which is mixing its revenue more into growing digital subscriptions and advertising and b) that management does have capability of paying down this debt as well as c)it is a small cap at around 150 million dollars and may not get the attention it needs. The intrinsic value is much higher than it trading at currently. Additionally, a new hedge fund revealed a 9.1% stake in the company which was its debt financing partner before this event. This signals to me that the hedge fund believe the company can payoff its debt load that it is willing to take a huge stake. It would make no sense for debt lender to want to see its equity burn if the company was to go bankrupt since it could just seize Lee's assets in bankruptcy with the debt it owns. I know I did not post my own thorough analysis cause I have not completed my own DCF yet, but on first glance what else should I look out for besides its heavy debt as well as industry it is in? Thanks all, I appreciate any insights as a young investor who is trying to learn appreciates it.

t3_2wwkpr,Berkshire Hathaway Letters to Shareholders - 1965-2013 - My Notes,"[As requested here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2wvd06/the_intelligent_investor_handbook/coujrvg)

I had previously read bits and pieces of the Berkshire Hathaway letters but had never taken the time to complete the entire ~50 years. Last June after attending the BRK AGM I loaded up [Max Olson's anthology](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0615975070/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) on my Kindle (just $2.50!) and over the course of the summer finished it. I used the Kindle's built-in note-taking features to record the best quotes.

**I would recommend anyone who is dedicated to fundamental investing (professional or focused amateurs) read the original letters in their entirety because you may find different sections meaningful.** Furthermore, what this summary fails to capture is the context of business performance for each year. **For those who fit the above, I think the best way to approach the letters is to start by reading [The Snowball](http://www.amazon.com/Snowball-Alice-Schroeder-ebook/dp/B009MYD9F8/), read the [partnership letters](http://www.rbcpa.com/WEB_letters/WEB_Letters_pre_berkshire.html) (which I admit to not having finished yet) up to 1965, and then dive in (reading the 1965-1969 BPL letters alongside BRK's).**

Anyway, for those looking for one, this is an ok summary at less than 10% of the length of the full letters. It includes a mix of bite-size quotes and most if not all of the longer essays. It hasn't been edited in any significant way so the relevance of some may be merely personal, context is occasionally lacking, and formatting is rough.

Unfortunately the letters aren't properly separated by year so the specific year references aren't included. The page references refer to Olson's Kindle version linked above.

t3_2wvsv1,"A daily DCF calculation for stocks on the NYSE, Nasdaq, LSE and ASX","For anyone looking to value stocks using discounted cash flow this may be a useful tool to form *part* of your due diligence.  

Or if you are looking to learn about how to do a DCF calculation, this will also be useful as we provide a worked example for each company.  

Simply Wall St now does a Discounted Cash Flow for companies listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, LSE and ASX on a daily basis. As always we present the results in infographic format, however if you click on the black bar chart, you can also see the full detail behind the calculation.  
  
Here are a couple of example companies (remember to click the black bar chart for detail):
http://simplywall.st/NYSE:IBM/international-business-machines#value  
http://simplywall.st/NasdaqGS:MSFT/microsoft#value  
  
  
The idea behind this post is to get feedback on the calculation:  
1)	As a newbie are you able to understandable how the calculation is presented?  
2)	If you have some experience with DCF do you have any opinions on the assumptions and inputs used?  

Bear in mind on Simply Wall St we need to be able to do this calculation for any listed stock (subject to analyst coverage) without human intervention, hence conservative assumptions are used where possible.  
  
To give a few details on the calculation:  

**Which cash flow is discounted?**  
As the calculation is intended to be used for valuing stocks, an Equity valuation is performed. This is as opposed to a Firm valuation which would include the value to any debtors. This uses Levered Free Cash Flow.  

In the case of Banks, Financial Service companies, REIT’s and Insurance firms dividends are used instead as Free Cash Flow is difficult to estimate and often not even reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of FCF as a dividend, this method will underestimate the value of the stock.   
  
**Which growth pattern is used?**  
The calculation allows for 5 years of high growth followed by stable growth.  
  
**Where is the data sourced from?**  
Consensus estimates (e.g. the mean of 20 analysts) for Levered Free Cash Flow or Dividends are used. If this does not exist for any given year the cash flow is assumed to grow at the average annual growth rate in revenue from the last 5 years.  
  
**Which method is used to calculate Terminal Value?**  
The Perpetuity Method (Gordon Formula) is used to calculate Terminal Value at an annual growth rate equal to the 10 year government bond rate.  
  
**What discount rate is used?**  
In the case of a Free Cash Flow to Equity Calculation the Cost of Equity is used as a discount rate. This is calculated from the Risk Free Rate (the 10 year government bond rate is used), the stocks Beta (see below) and a Market Risk Premium (Currently 10% - Risk Free Rate).  
  
**How is the bottom up Beta calculated?**  
A bottom up Beta is calculated for each company by looking at the Unlevered Beta for companies in the same industry and then levered to account for any debt.

t3_2z9y88,Valuing the growth story behind Shake Shack SHAK,"The story behind SHAK's $1.7 billion valuation seems to be that the company has a history of strong growth and has Chipotle-like potential here.  While that may be true, I wanted to look and see what the future may hold by estimating revenue and earnings in multiple situations: 

* FY2015 projections based off of estimates made by the Company during this quarterly report

* FY2015 projections based off of double the store growth estimates made by the Company during this quarterly report

* FY2017 projections based off of estimates made by the Company during this quarterly report

* FY2019 projections based off of estimates made by the Company during this quarterly report

* FY2015 projections based off of my estimates of the Company's 2015 growth

I created an excel model that roughly accounted for the following variables:

* Growth in domestic, company-owned stores (DCO)

* Same-Shak comp store sales growth for DCOs

* Individual operating expense growth for DCOs

* Growth in licensed stores

* Growth in licensing fees

[Picture of the Excel Model](http://i.imgur.com/GiLY5SO.png)

[Full results can be found here](http://i.imgur.com/VJX0xRw.png)

Summary of the Results:
Based on the Company’s history and forward-looking statements made by the Company, it is reasonable to expect sales to grow between 38% and 42% for FY 2015, annually at 27.24% between now and FY 2017, and annually at 25.31% between now and FY 2019.  Earnings are expected to grow 79% annually between now and FY 2017 and 56% annually between now and 2019.  It is my belief that a quality company such as SHAK that experiences this level of growth should trade at a price-to-earnings multiple of around twice the annualized growth rate.  Looking out at the next three to five years, I expect an earnings and revenue growth rate of between 56% and 79% and between 25% and 27% respectively.  Merging the higher of the two, I come to an annual growth rate for the next three to five years of 53%.  Using my FY 2015 operating income projections, this would value SHAK at $525.75 Million, or $14.50 per share.  **In other words, it is my opinion that the original $14-$16 SHAK IPO range was, indeed, accurate, and that the stock is currently overvalued by 3.35 times.**

t3_30ef7s,"Here's a condensed summary of my research on ARLP, one of my favorite current investments (x-post r/investing)","**Background:**

Alliance Natural Resource Partners (ARLP, currently trading at around $33 a share) is a U.S. based thermal coal (the kind used for electricity, as opposed to mettalurgic coal which is used for steel). It is the 8th largest producer of coal in the country, and has consistently grown capacity by double digits per year for more than a decade.

ARLP produces only thermal coal, and does not export. It is therefore not directly affected by either international coal demand or by steel demand.

**Answer to immediate objections:**

1: ""Coal is a dying fuel, we won't be using it at all in the near future!""

* Actually every single major energy organization expects coal to generate a significant amount of our power all the way through 2040. Even the EPA, who hate coal and would love to see it gotten rid of, model coal to maintain a stable share of the power generation market (25-30% of total power) through 2040.

2: ""Solar/Nuclear/Wind/Fusion are going to take all the share and coal will stop being used!""

* No, see above. No one in the energy industry actually thinks this.

3: ""China is so polluted, they're not going to use anymore coal, that's the death knell for the industry!""

* Emerging markets matter a lot to some of the biggest players, but ARLP does not export coal. They sell exclusively into the U.S.

**Basic valuation**

ARLP is currently trading at 7.0x TTM P/E, and 8.0x forward. Even if there is no growth at all in earnings, the stock is still attractive at less than half the average multiple of the S&P. 

To put some numbers on it, a basic DCF shows the following (growth expressed as 5 years annualized, 12% discount rate, 12x exit multiple):

* Value assuming no growth: ~$60, almost 100% upside
* Value assuming 10% unit growth: ~$100, 3x upside
* Value assuming -10% units &-15% pricing: ~$32, no change

**Thesis**

The company is a good trade even without unit growth or improved coal pricing, but there are two factors that make me believe we'll see both:

1: The competition is in the shitter right now.

* 4 of the top 5 U.S. coal producers are losing (a lot) of money every quarter, and none of them are expected to turn a profit next year. They are highly levered, and some are getting dangerously close to tripping the covenants on their debt.

* Newly passed regulations favor the type of coal that ARLP produces (due to its position in the Illinois Basin) at the direct expense of the certain competitors. In fact, I've been told that as many as 50% of the mines in certain regions of Appalachia are currently not profitable, and are only continuing to be operated because it would cost more to shut them down that to keep them running. This is unsustainable, and ARLP is well poised to pick up the slack, having just purchased a large new swath of reserves contiguous to their current operations. 

2: Coals most serious competition is natural gas, but rig counts are falling and there's a good chance that a lot of supply will be coming offline as quickly depleting shale wells aren't renewed given current abysmal O&G pricing.

**Evidence and additional assurances**

With that highly condensed version of the thesis, let's move on to a bit of evidence, and some other key bits of information that provide some comfort:

Exhibit 1: ARLP has already made an agreement to acquire equipment and potentially contracts from Patriot Coal, who is drastically curtailing operations to try and stave off bankruptcy. Patriot is a spinoff of the largest U.S. coal producer, Peabody, that contains their unionized mines and the pension liabilities that go with them (which is currently the subject of a lawsuit). This shows that the beginnings of failure are already happening.

Exhibit 2: There have been a number of announcements related to supply cuts by major producers, and ARLP as taken market share. 

Exhibit 3: According to EIA data, ARLP has a far better contracting position, with a majority of their supply being contracted for between 1 and 3 years out. Their main competitors are heavily weighted towards contracts that expire much sooner. 

Comfort 1: ARLP has a stellar long term track record (especially compared to other coal companies), and a widely lauded management team that's been in place for decades. 

Comfort 2: As stated, the majority of ARLP's supply is already under mid to long term contracts.

Comfort 3: ARLP has far less debt than the competition, and has room to add more if needed.

Comfort 4: Due to its location, ARLP has great access to all three major types of transportation: rail, barge, and truck. Others do not share their level of access and flexibility on transportation.

***

I would encourage anyone that's interested to dig into the EIA data. There's so much there that you can work with to prove out the points I've laid out above. I've done a lot of work with it, as well as EPA forecasts, transportation costs, mine and plant level models, and talking to management, that's all lead to my conviction on the investment. I hope this encourages a few of you guys to take a look beyond the headlines, or at least that it was an interesting read.

t3_3gckuq,Let's take a look at Bakkafrost (my third analysis) [xpost from r/investing]," **Bullet points**

 Financially solid salmon producer with strong management in place

 Good and sustainable dividend yield (currently yielding ~3%) 

 Several potential catalysts in place

 Upside of 20% based on DAOE model

 **Bakkafrost**

 Bakkafrost is a Faroese salmon producer listed on the Millennium Oslo Stock Exchange (from here on “OSE”). It trades on the US OTC board under the ticker ”BKFKF”. Bakkafrost is the largest and only public traded salmon producer on the Faroe Islands and offers a wide range of different salmon products including whole, gutted salmon, value added products and fish-meal, -oil and -feed (FOF). Bakkafrost produced 44.013 tons of gutted salmon and 85.724 FOF in 2014. 

 Bakkafrost owns six hatcheries, 19 farming sites, five wellboats, three harvesting plants, two VAP plants and an FOF plant. The current investment plan started in 2013 and is planned to add another wellboat (delivered July 2015), another hatchery (expected to be completed in Q2 2016) and a merged harvest/VAP plant (expected to be up and running in 2016). 
Bakkafrost is fully vertically integrated. The current (2014) company structure can be seen below (Havsbrún is the FOF plant).

 [Figure 1 – Bakkafrost company structure](http://i.imgur.com/bXQhV2j.png)

 Below is a quick historical overview of Bakkafrost’s evolution from a small, family owned company to a successful, public company.  

 **1968** - Bakkafrost was founded by the two brothers Hans and Roland Jacobsen. The early Bakkafrost was mainly engaged in catching and processing of herring. 

 **1986** - Production of farmed salmon and smolts (young salmons) began. 

 **1995** - The first salmon value-added-product (VAP) factory was built and the production capacity of VAP products was increased in 1999-2001. Bakkafrost continued to grow both through M&A activity in the early 2000’s. 

 **2008** - Bakkafrost started merger talks with Vestlax (another salmon producer). 

 **2010** - The merger went through making Bakkafrost the largest fish farming company in the Faroe Islands with 55% of the country’s salmon production. Bakkafrost went public in 2010. 

 **2011** - Bakkafrost acquired Havsbrún, an FOF plant. This acquisition made Bakkafrost fully vertically integrated – from the production of FOF all the way to production of VAP and sales. Being fully vertically integrated, Bakkafrost has complete oversight over all the critical production points. This helps insure a high quality product and full traceability. 

 **2013** - Bakkafrost announced an ambitious 5-year investment plan to make the onshore operation more efficient, to increase organic growth and to reduce the biological risk.

 **2014** - The best financial result ever was reached in part because of the Russian import ban on Norwegian salmon. Bakkafrost is currently being led by the son of Hans Jacobsen, Regin Jacobsen who has been the CEO for over 30 years. Bakkafrost was named OSE second best mid-cap company in 2014. 

 Note: Bakkafrost reports financial numbers in DKK (Danish Kroner) but is listed on the OSE and trades in NOK (Norwegian Kroner). Conversions between the two currencies will be made throughout the analysis at a rate of DKKNOK = 0,8225.

 **Brief industry overview**

 The salmon industry is composed of producers from many different countries spread out over the globe. The biggest producers are located in Canada, Chile, The Faroe Islands, Norway, Scotland and the United Kingdom where the biological conditions for salmons are optimal.

 [Figure 2 - Harvest volume by country](http://i.imgur.com/4PK1lYH.png)

 Back in the day salmon was mostly caught in the wild. Nowadays salmon –especially the Atlantic kind - is primarily farmed. The change has been driven by increased global demand combined with limited expansion capabilities in the wild due to fishing regulations, quotas and biological restraints. Farming salmon as opposed to catching them in the wild has the advantages that it gives greater control over the production, easier catching/ transportation and better disease control. 

 [Figure 3 - Wild vs Farmed by volume](http://i.imgur.com/C9cYo1l.png)

 Salmon is most often sold and bought in the spot market(s) or on longer term contracts with a price based on the spot price. The historical price can be seen below. Note the trending nature of the price but with large short-term volatility. 

 [Figure 4 - Salmon spot price - 25 and 50 MA](http://i.imgur.com/1n7lPBS.png)

 The spot price is driven by the balance between supply and demand (obviously) which is affected by several factors. The supply is affected by political intervention such as regulations/quotas, new investments in farms and equipment and biological/geographical factors such as diseases and weather conditions. Some of the factors driving the demand are global wealth growth, global population growth and focus sustainability (salmon farming is far more environment friendly than classic creature farming). Note that the key demand drivers are primarily megatrends.
 
 The salmon farming industry is near maximum farming/biological capacity and increasing the capacity requires large capital expenditures to new farms, processing plants, well-boats etc. As a result the global supply is expected to increase 4-5% in 2015 and 2-3% in 2016. The expectation is a yearly 3% supply increase until 2020. A balanced market with no change in spot price seems to be reached with a global supply growth of 9% per year. This strongly suggests that we will see salmon prices continue on its long-term climb in the coming years. 

 In August 2014 Russia imposed an import ban on European salmon. This created a major supply vacuum in the Russian market and enabled non-EU salmon producers to sell their fish at a premium. Bakkafrost has been a major beneficiary of this development. At the moment the ban looks to be standing as long as the situation is tense between Russia and the Western world.

 **Recent share price development**

 The chart below shows the 52-week development in Bakkafrost’s share price.

 [Figure 5 – 52 week share price](http://i.imgur.com/U7qyihS.png)

 The overall trend has been upwards mainly attributed to great financial results and the Russian situation. In the period October 2014 to April 2015 we saw some consolidation and falling share prices mainly attributable to falling/consolidating salmon spot prices. After the Q1 results reported on the 12th May we saw a strong upward movement in the price as a result of the great financial results achieved in the first quarter (it was the single best quarter in the company’s history). 

 **Management and shareholders**

 Regin Jacobsen is the CEO of Bakkafrost (1982-present day). He holds almost 4.5 million Bakkafrost shares worth over 100 million US dollars. This equals 9.2% of the total outstanding shares. His mother Oddvør Jacobsen owns 9.4% of the outstanding shares. In total the Jacobsen family owns 18.6% of the outstanding shares. The large insider ownership secures a strong alignment of shareholder’s and management’s interest. Other insiders own 0.4% of the outstanding shares. There is no option salary program in Bakkafrost and thus no (potential) dilution of the shareholder’s interest in the company except – of course – from any future equity issuance. 
 
 Regin Jacobsen has transformed the small family owned business to the Faroe Islands’ biggest and one of the world’s most successful salmon producers (looking at profit margins). He won a price for being the best CEO of a mid-cap company listed on the OSE in 2014. Salmon analysts have called the current management team the world’s best Atlantic salmon management team. 

 Reading the management’s letter to shareholders and listening to the conference calls, it is clear that the management has a long term focus. The long term focus is seen at large in Bakkafrost’s ambitious long-term investment plan.

 Having a strong management team combined with no potential dilution and a long term focus is a big bonus in my opinion. On top of these qualities it gives me faith in the company’s future prospect to know that the CEO (and family) has a lot of skin in the game. 

 After the Jacobsen family, JP Morgan is the biggest shareholder and owns 7.8% of the outstanding shares through five different subsidiaries. 

 **Products, customers and geography**

 Bakkafrost is engaged in the production and selling of fresh/frozen fish, VAP’s and FOF. 

 FOF is produced at Havsbrún. The major part of the produced feed is used in Bakkafrost’s own farming segment. Only 20 % (17537 ton out of a total production of 85724 ton - FY 2014) of the produced feed is sold externally to other fish (salmon) producers. The FOF business is generally highly volatile due to underlying volatility in the raw products (fish leftovers and/or different plant parts) going into the production of FOF. The Q1 EBITDA margin of 30,53% in the FOF segment is not sustainable and is related to very favorable raw material cost at the end of 2014. In earlier years the EBITDA margin has averaged around 10-15%. Bakkafrost uses a higher content of fish oil in its feed than the average in the fish feed industry. This makes the production of feed slightly costlier but results in salmons with higher fat (omega 3) content. Feed cost is one of the largest expenses in salmon farming and the FOF plant provides some stability regarding prices. 

 Whole gutted salmon (or head on gutted – HOG for short) is sold at spot prices to fish markets/other wholesalers. Selling salmon at a volatile spot price gives a somewhat volatile revenue and income stream. Bakkafrost has historically achieved nice margins in this segment.

 VAP’s is sold on longer term contracts to retailers and wholesalers. The prices on the contracts are based on the forward price in the salmon markets as opposed to the spot price. VAP contracts are 6-12 month in length and given the fixed price, provides a more predictable and stable income than the fresh/frozen segment. The EBIT margin achieved in the VAP segment is considerably lower and more volatile than in the fresh segment. 

 In 2014 45% of the harvested volume was used in the VAP segment while 55% was sold whole and gutted. The long term goal is to sell 40-50% of the harvested volume as VAP products. The new VAP factory will help achieve this goal as harvested volume increases in the future. 

 Bakkafrost is located favorably to export their products all over the globe. Historically, most of the Bakkafrost fish has been sold in the EU and USA. The fattier salmon taste obtained by fish feed with higher fat content is a big hit in the US. Asia has taken an increased amount of Bakkafrost fish in recent years mainly for use in sushi.  

 In 2014 a higher fraction of the fish has gone to Russia as a result of the supply vacuum following the ban on imported Norwegian salmon. Bakkafrost salmon can be sold at a premium in Russia as a result of this situation. As long as the tension between Russia and the Western world remains (and the import ban is intact), Bakkafrost is expected to sell a larger than average volume to the Russian market. 

 **Competitive edge**

 Bakkafrost operates in a commodity-like industry where true competitive advantages are somewhat rare. Bakkafrost, however, do enjoy some competitive advantages which are pushing their margins higher than industry average. One of the competitive advantages is permanent and related to the geographically location of Bakkafrost’s operations. Another one is temporary and related to the Russian situation. The last is related to the current management team and is long-term but not permanent.  

 Bakkafrost has a permanent lower feed cost because of the biological conditions in the Faroe Islands (more stable temperature throughout the year among others). As mentioned earlier the feed cost is one of the main costs in producing salmon. Having a lower feed cost provides Bakkafrost with a nice competitive advantage. This competitive advantage is well-protected through a limited number of farming licenses and Faroe regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 20% of any salmon farmer.

 Bakkafrost is not affected by the Russian import ban on European salmon. As a result Bakkafrost has acquired a sizeable chunk of the Russian salmon market and can sell its salmon at a premium compared to the spot price. This is a temporary, but possibly long standing, competitive edge. 

 On top of these two competitive edges, Bakkafrost’s management is highly skilled and focused on efficiency throughout the organization. Bruce Greenwald has stated that companies operating in commodity(-like) businesses need to have a strong focus on being the lowest-cost producer and operating as efficiently as possible. I would consider the skill of the current management team another competitive edge.

 **Risks**

 Bakkafrost is exposed to several company and industry specific risks. 

 A lower salmon price is one of the major risks faced by Bakkafrost and other salmon producers. Both top line and bottom line is heavily influenced by the salmon price. A long time with low/declining salmon prices will push the revenue and earnings down and hurt Bakkafrost.

 Since feed cost is one of the major costs associated with salmon farming, a rising feed cost will have a negative impact on Bakkafrost’s profit if it isn’t followed by a higher spot price. Feed cost is influenced by commodity prices which are highly volatile and hard to predict. This risk is somewhat mitigated by Bakkafrost’s ownership of an FOF plant. 

 Diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites such as sea lice can hurt or kill the salmons and is another risk involved in salmon farming. Overall Bakkafrost has a good control with its salmon production and disease-risk has been managed tightly. Bakkafrost is actively engaged in research aimed at controlling these potential problems and is currently working on a solution to the sea lice problem by employing sea lice eating fishes (so called cleaner fish) in the salmon farms. The new well boat delivered in July is also capable of treating sea lice infected fish through a fresh water treating facility. 

 Bakkafrost is enjoying higher margins as a result of the Russian situation. If Russia removes the import ban on salmon from Norway and other EU countries the salmon supply to the Russian market will skyrocket. Bakkafrost will be hurt somewhat by this as they can no longer sell their fish at a premium. 
Overall Bakkafrost is a fairly risky business. This will be reflected in the required return used in my valuation model. 

 **Financials**

 In this section I will take a closer look at Bakkafrost’s financial statements. Some of my comments will be about my own and/or the managements expectations for the future. This will be used in the later forecast needed to make a valuation. 

 [Figure 6 - Income statement percentage change](http://i.imgur.com/jcOmxxN.png)

 [Figure 7 - Income statement common size](http://i.imgur.com/enbzumL.png)

 Looking at the income statement we see the numbers of a profitable and growing company. 

 Revenue has been growing 34,49% per year since 2010 which is attributable to a larger harvest volume (44013 ton gw in 2014 against 21626 in 2010) and a higher realized price per ton gw. We saw some slowdown in the revenue growth from 2013-2014 but I expect the growth to accelerate in the coming years as a result of the expected higher spot prices and the results of the investment plan. Especially the plan of reducing growing times of salmons from 18 months to 14-15 months gradually over the next 3 should provide a nice boost on the top-line in the coming years (guided at ~4% per year over the next three years from this development alone).

 The most notable thing in the operating expenses section is that expenses have grown considerably since 2010. This shows us that Bakkafrost is not a company that can grow without investing in more raw material purchases, higher expenses to salaries, more PP&E (leading to higher depreciation charges) etc. Even though expenses have grown, they have only grown at (roughly) the same pace as revenue. This means that we have (roughly) the same operating margin today as we did in 2010. Given the high operating margin back then, I consider this a great result and it shows the management’s dedication to efficiency and meaningful growth. 

 The new harvest/VAP plant being built as part of the investment plan is expected to reduce operating expenses by 70-90 million DKK per year from 2017 and onwards. Together with the other parts of the investment plan, this makes me believe that Bakkafrost will keep on having expenses under tight control while revenue is growing nicely. 

 The fair value adjustment on biomass and (provisions for) onerous contracts are both IFRS-related non-cash adjustments made to the operational result every year. The fair value adjustment on biomass is an adjustment to reflect the current value of Bakkafrost’s biomass given changes in spot price and other changing (biological) conditions. The “onerous contracts”-item is related to the long-term VAP contracts and other contracts related to raw materials. A negative “onerous contracts”-post means that Bakkafrost is locked in contracts where the economic benefit will be lower than the cost of fulfilling the contract. In 2014 we saw a reversal of 2012 and 2013’s negative posts because conditions changed and the negative impacts were not realized as expected. As seen, both fluctuates and are very difficult to forecast with the information provided by Bakkafrost in the financial statements. 

 “Income from associates” is Bakkafrost’s share in the income of its associates P/f Pelagos (30% ownership), P/f Salmon Proteins (76% ownership), P/f Keldan (25% ownership), Hanstholm Fiskemelsfabrik (40% ownership) and P/f Faroe Farming (49% ownership). I expect these companies to attribute with a small, positive result in the future if salmon prices rise. 

 “Listing costs”, “badwill related to the acquisition of Havsbrún”, “acquisition costs” and “loss from sale of subsidiary” are non-recurring charges. The first two were one-time charges related to the listing on the OSE and the acquisition of Havsbrún. The last two are related to Bakkafrost’s acquisitions and sale of divisions/related companies. Bakkafrost has mentioned that they will make meaningful acquisitions/take stakes in other salmon-related companies if it is at good terms and in line with the overall strategy. 

 The financial income is related to the interests earned on Bakkafrost’s big cash position and any dividends received from associated companies. 

 The interest expense is related to the coupons on the bond issue, interest on the revolving credit facilities and interests on the instalment loan (all three described in greater detail under the balance sheet section). Note that the current interest expense is covered many times over by the operational earnings (and operational cash flow). 
The net currency effect is related to the currency gain on the 500 million NOK bond. 

 The currency gain comes as a result of the sharp decline in the NOKDKK pair (Bakkafrost reports numbers in DKK). A currency-swap is in place which swaps the NOK to DKK. This means that the currency gain/loss is counteracted by a loss/gain on the currency swap. This counter effect is reported under comprehensive earnings. 

 The Faroe Islands have a nominal tax rate of 18% and a special resource tax of 4,5% from 2014 and onwards. The effective tax rate was 28,03% in 2014 due to earlier deferred taxes. I expect the effective tax rate to remain above the nominal tax rate for some time due a big deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. I expect the effective tax rate to be 22,5% in the longer run. 

 There are no non-controlling interests taking part in the profits of Bakkafrost. Furthermore there is no potential dilution from options as they are not part of the employer/executive salary package. The only potential dilution is from potential future increase of equity. Later in the cash flow section I will explain why I don’t see new equity being issued in the near future. 

 When looking at the income statement it is worth noting that in 2014 the margins were higher than the 2010-2013 average margins. As stated earlier this is attributable to the Russian situation. But it is also worth noting that the 2010-2013 margins were high even without having the effect of the Russian import ban. This shows us that Bakkafrost enjoys the gains from the Russian situation but is in no way dependent on it to survive or produce above average margins. 

 Condensing the income statement into one word I would call it “great”. 

 [Figure 8 - Balance sheet percentage change](http://i.imgur.com/mEtoqwx.png)

 [Figure 9 - Balance sheet common size](http://i.imgur.com/GGk1E1v.png)

 Looking at the balance sheet we see the numbers of a financially solid company.
 
 The “Intangible assets”-item is the first and in my opinion the most interesting item in the balance sheet. Bakkafrost writes that: “Intangible assets comprise primarily the fair value of acquired farming licenses. No licenses in the North region are recorded with a value in the Bakkafrost accounts.” This could mean that we’re looking at a sizeable hidden asset since a license to farm salmon in a given area is by no means worthless.

 First of all we have to split up the farming sites (and their farming license) into a Farming West and a Farming North region. Bakkafrost does not disclose which farming sites belong to Farming West and which ones belong to Farming North. After many hours of searching I found a semi-outdated site which lists all the Faroe fishing licenses and the owners. On figure 10 we see all Bakkafrost’s farming sites marked with circles. The yellow ones are listed on the site as belonging to “Bakkafrost Farming North” while the green ones are listed as belonging to “Bakkafrost Farming West”. The farming sites represented by red circles are listed as either belonging to just “Bakkafrost Farming” or another company from which Bakkafrost has later acquired the license. The blue line on figure 10 is my best guess at a division between the two regions. 

 [Figure 10 - Bakkafrost farming locations](http://i.imgur.com/WRwYcfR.png)

 This means that we have between eight and ten farming licenses which are recorded at a value of 0. To put a value on this hidden asset I’ll take a look at the value of the fishing licenses which are already on the balance sheet. 

 The intangible asset (worth 294,7 million DKK) is composed of at least six and up to nine farming licenses. To be conservative I’ll assume that this number is for all nine licenses potentially belonging to Bakkafrost Farming West. This means that each license is worth 294,7 million DKK / 9 = 32,7 million DKK per license. Therefore the eight to ten licenses located in the North region is worth between 261,6 and 327 million DKK. The market values Bakkafrost’s assets at 2,9 times assets. Using this as a guide, the hidden assets could be equal to 758,64-948,3 million DKK of additional market value. This is roughly 7%-9% of Bakkafrost’s current market cap. 
Given the uncertainty of the calculations made above I will not include the value of the hidden asset in my total business valuation. It is an area worthy of further research though and later on I will contact the management/IR department and ask them about it. 

 The total PP&E consists of all non-financial “hard assets” in Bakkafrost. This includes the hatcheries (six), farming sites (19), wellboats (five), harvesting plants (three), offices (various sales offices and the headquarter), processing plants (two), packaging plant (one), FOF plant (one), prepayments made for several hard assets in the investment plant and various other small PP&E assets such as computers, furniture etc. 

 Under the “Total non-current financial items” we have the “Investments in associated companies” and “Investments in stocks and shares” which consists of the stakes in the associated companies mentioned earlier. The long-term receivable is a minor item related to a long standing receivable with a customer. It is expected to be realized at the value stated on the balance sheet. 

 The total inventory consists of the biomass (equal to ~30% of the total assets) and other inventory. The biomass is valued at fair value and subject to an adjustment every year. The other inventory consists primarily of raw materials going into the FOF plant, packing material and semi-finished goods.

 The “total receivables”-item consists of accounts receivables and other receivables. Accounts receivables have grown far less than the total amount of assets which shows a tighter control with the account receivables. The other receivables are related to VAT, deposits for derivatives and receivables from the associated companies. 

 The cash and cash equivalent item is the bank deposits and other near-cash instruments such as short term bonds. Even with a high dividend and ambitious investment Bakkafrost has been able to build a big cash position (11,7% of total assets). I suspect that the cash position hasn’t been distributed as a dividend/buyback due to upcoming debt liabilities, future payments for the investment plan and to “buff up” the balance sheet in order to be able to withstand potential adverse industry/company specific developments. 

 Overall the total amount of assets has grown rapidly since 2010. The growth in total assets has been faster than the growth in equity because the total liabilities have been growing faster than the total assets. 

 The equity has been growing fast with no increase in the share capital. This is the result of high and fast growing comprehensive income. The equity/liabilities-ratio has been shrinking since 2010 due to new debt financing. The equity share is ~60% which I consider enough given the high amount of liquid assets, interest coverage ratio and quick ratio. 

 Long-term interest bearing liabilities (short- and long-term) consists of three different debt instruments which accounts for ~17,5% of the total equity and liabilities and 43,2% of the total liabilities. The first debt instrument is a 500 million NOK unsecured bond issued in 2013 with a five year tenor. The interest is NIBOR 3m + 4,15%. The currency has been swapped to DKK and the interest rate to CIBOR 3m due to primary exposure to DKK and EUR. The second debt instrument is an instalment loan of 500 million DKK obtained in 2011. It is payable with 25 million DKK each quarter (100 million DKK is listed as “short-term interested bearing debts”). The last debt instrument is a 600 million DKK (adjusted down to 553 million DKK after a sale of a subsidiary) overdraft facility fully payable in 2016.  

 As written earlier I suspect that the interest bearing debt is part of the reason why Bakkafrost has been building a big cash position. They have to pay back 653 million DKK in 2016, 100 million DKK (remainder of the instalment loan) in 2017 and 500 million NOK in 2018. Bakkafrost currently has 753 million DKK in available bank financing. 

 Bakkafrost has a sizeable deferred tax liability that – as noted under the income statement section – will keep the effective tax rate higher than the nominal tax rate for some time into the future. 

 The “derivatives”-item is an item related to different derivatives used in Bakkafrost. The two derivatives mentioned in the annual report are the currency-swap and the interest rate-swap related to the bond.

 In 2013 Bakkafrost decided to break the current liabilities into more sub-categories. “Trade payables” and “other current liabilities” took the place of “accounts payable and other debt” in 2013. These are small items related to bills waiting to be paid and other small, current liabilities not specified by Bakkafrost.

 In total, the amount of liabilities has been rising fast. It is however not alarming in my eyes since Bakkafrost generates huge amounts of cash through operations and have a lot of cash on hand to pay upcoming debts (see next section). 

 Overall the balance sheet and capital structure look solid to me. I do however want to keep a close eye on the development in the balance sheet when the big debt payments arrive because they arrive at a time where cash is needed for the investment plan. It should be no problem due to a high free cash flow (see next section) but it is always worth being on top of these sorts of things. 

 [Figure 11 - Cash flow statement](http://i.imgur.com/iy2Ttj4.png)

 Looking at the cash flow statement we see a flourishing company creating a solid stream of free cash flow.

 The cash flow from operations takes the operational EBIT and adds back all the non-cash charges made on the income statement such as the fair value adjustments to the biomass and depreciation charges. It has been growing very fast in the last years primarily attributable to the fast increase in operational EBIT.

 In the investment section we see the cash used in various investments. The most notable part is the massive use of money to buy or prepay PP&E. This is the result of the investment plan. Worth noting is that Bakkafrost still has a lot of money left after paying for the various investments. In other words, Bakkafrost has a high amount of free cash flow which is great. The high free cash flow points in the direction of no additional equity issuance in the near future and a high sustainability of the current dividend. 

 Looking at the financing section we see that Bakkafrost has acquired extra funding through the various debt instruments mentioned in the balance sheet section. One of the main cash drainers is the high (and historically fast growing) dividend being paid. The upcoming payment of 653 million DKK will be another major cash drainer next year but Bakkafrost should have no trouble with the payment given the high free cash flow and big cash position. When some of the current interest bearing debt has been payed of I could see Bakkafrost raise the dividend aggressively or initiate a buyback program due to the high free cash flow. 

 Overall the cash flow statement supports my conclusion regarding the income statement and balance sheet. The story being told by the financial statements is that we are looking at a great company. During my analysis I discovered no suspicious accounting. From the revenue recognition practices to the assumptions used to fair value the biomass and intangible assets, everything looks okay in my eyes.

 **Dividend policy**

 The dividend is currently at 6 DKK (payout ratio of 45%). The dividend policy is to payout 30-50% of the net income. Management has said that the investment plan will not change the dividend policy. 

 As written in the last section, Bakkafrost has a high free cash flow and therefore I consider the current dividend sustainable. 

 The current dividend gives a yield of 3%. Be advised that you MIGHT experience some dividend related tax troubles depending on your location. Personally, I have to send a letter to the Faroe tax authority every year to get a tax refund on the dividend. 

 [Figure 12 - EPS DPS and Payout ratio](http://i.imgur.com/qQcxtUG.png)

 **Competitors**

 The list of competitors is composed of the other seafood companies listed on the OSE. 

 **Austevoll Seafood** is the fourth largest company in the group with a market cap of 8,5 billion NOK. Austevoll is a diversified pelagic fishery based in Norway but with operations in Chile, Norway and Peru. 

 **Grieg Seafood** is the second smallest company in the group with a market cap of 2,9 billion NOK. Grieg Seafood is a salmon and trout producer based in Norway but with operations in Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. 

  **Lerøy Seafood Group** is the second largest company in the group with a market cap of 15,3 billion NOK. Lerøy Seafood Group is engaged in salmon farming and diversified seafood. 

  **Marine Harvest** is the largest company in the group with a market cap of 45,4 billion NOK. Marine Harvest offers a wide range of seafood. It is based in Norway but has operations in most of the major seafood countries. 

  **Norway Royal Salmon** is the third smallest company in the group with a market cap of 3,1 billion NOK. Norway Royal Salmon is a salmon and trout producer based in Norway. 

  **SalMar** is the third largest company in the group with a market cap of 14,6 billion NOK. SalMar is a salmon producer based in Norway. 

 **The Scottish Salmon Company** is the smallest company in the group with a market cap of 0,98 billion NOK. The Scottish Salmon company is a salmon producer based in Scotland. 


 To give you an idea about the relative ranking between these companies and Bakkafrost, I have chosen to compare them with the use of nine business metrics. Revenue and EBIT growth tells us something about how much the companies have grown in the recent past. EBIT margin and EBIT per kg gutted weight tells us something about how good the companies are at turning one dollar of revenue/one kg gutted fish into operating profit. ROIC and ROCE tells us something about how good the companies are at using their invested/employed capital optimal. Interest coverage and quick ratio tells us something about the companies’ financial strength. Lastly we have a dividend yield which is our direct yield of holding the investment. 

 [Figure 13 - Comparison on business metrics](http://i.imgur.com/OEprSLm.png)

 The top two in each metric is colored green and the bottom two is colored red. Looking at these business ratios, Bakkafrost is by far the best company of the group. It ranks as the best or second best in almost every ratio. In the two ratios where it doesn’t, it still has a solid position. A quick ratio of right around 2 (especially combined with the magnificent interest coverage) and a sustainable dividend yield just shy of 3% is not bad at all. 

 **Valuation**

 [Figure 14 – Relative valuation](http://i.imgur.com/g9tiOtg.png)

 Given that Bakkafrost is the best company in the comparison group (as measured by the nine business metrics) one might expect that Bakkafrost is valued relatively high compared to the others. But this is actually not the case. Looking at figure 14 we see that Bakkafrost is valued approximately in the middle of the group. It is neither cheap nor expensive measured on a relative basis. My earlier analysis points in the direction of a good future for Bakkafrost and the reasonable relative valuation could mean that we’re looking at a bargain.  

 To determine whether Bakkafrost is a bargain at the current price, I will use a Discounted Abnormal Operating Model (DAOE). This type of model is described in greater detail in “Financial Statements Analysis and Security Valuation” by Stephen Penman. It is somewhat expensive but I highly recommended it. 

 I will do a base case, optimist case (moderately optimistic, not “blue sky”) and pessimist case (moderately pessimistic, not “draconian”) valuation. The valuation will be based on a five year proforma statement for each case. The “cost of operations”/WACC is based on a “bottom up”-beta (Damodaran’s concept) with added industry specific risk. 

 The base case is built around average result from the investment plan and a moderate increase in salmon spot prices and harvest volumes

 [Figure 15 – Base case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/D4icNia.png)

 In the base case we get a fair value of 316,25 NOK per share. I consider the base case the most probable and assign it a probability of 60%. 

 The pessimist case is built on expectations of poor results from the investment plan, a moderate decrease in salmon spot prices and a constant harvest volume

 [Figure 16 – Pessimist case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/UW8ZxDa.png)

 In the pessimist case we get a fair value of 183,11 NOK per share. I consider the pessimist/optimist case the least probable and assign them both a probability of 20%.
The optimist case is built on high expectations for the investment plant and a solid increase in salmon spot prices and harvest volume

 [Figure 17 – Optimist case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/wCteyLe.png)

 In the base case we get a fair value of 395,72 NOK per share.

 Condensing the three cases into a single valuation I come up with a value of 305,5 NOK (0,60 * 316,25 NOK + 0,2 * 183,11 NOK + 0,2 * 395,72 NOK) per share. This value is 20,3% percent higher than the current price of 254 NOK. 

 **Catalysts**

 There are several different potential catalysts in the near future that can push Bakkafrost to my estimated fair value of 305,5 NOK.

 As written in the industry overview, salmon prices are expected to rise in the coming years as supply growth slows down. This is currently the biggest catalyst for Bakkafrost and I expect a strong rally as a result of great financial results if the higher spot price materializes as expected.  

 Chile is the second largest producer of salmon after Norway. The Chilean farming capacity has grown at an explosive rate in the last decade and quality/disease control has not been able to keep up with the growth. Therefore, news about adverse developments in the Chilean salmon/fishing industry such as disease outbreaks comes out every now and then. This kind of news pushes up the price of non-Chilean salmon farmers. Production problems in Chile act as a potential catalyst on non-Chilean farmers especially farmers (such as Bakkafrost) who can sell their fish to the Russian market with even less competition.

 The Russian situation is a joker in the Bakkafrost case. A step up (or prolongation) of the Russian conflict could act as a catalyst and push the stock price up but it could also hurt the investor sentiment and make investors more risk averse. 

 **Conclusion**

 Bakkafrost is a great company operating in an interesting industry which stands to benefit from limited supply growth in the short/mid-term and several megatrends in the long run. The management in place is as good as it gets and has been called the best salmon farming management team by analysts. 

 The gap up to my valuation of 305,5 NOK can be closed by several near-term catalysts. Bakkafrost is currently valued at a discount of 20,3% based on my valuation. Bakkafrost is not a deep value stock but rather a “good company at a fair price” kind of value opportunity. It is to some degree a play on the tension between Russia and the western world.

 My recommendation: **Buy**

t3_3gx4tr,Does Black Scholes still break in special situations (as Greenblatt suggested)?,"I just finished reading Joel Greenblatt's first book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius. Having studied the Black Scholes model at school, I always found it weird that using just historical volatility, current price and interest rates, you could fairly price an option while completely ignoring things that happen with businesses that are not reflected in such blunt measures as volatility. Joel Greenblatt sort of confirmed this oddity when he showed an example of how he bought options expiring in about a month just a couple of weeks after a special situation with the stock was going down. Obviously the Black Scholes model didn't take the existence of the special situation into account and so it pretty much broke in that situation.

While I would expect the BSM framework to still break down in special situations, I do however expect that the market would end up pricing the options correctly through supply and demand. So my question to you is that does the BSM framework still break down in special situations as Greenblatt suggested years ago in his book?

t3_3ku0z3,Are the fundamentals for NFLX changing?,"Let me preface this post by saying that I have not done a full read of NFLX's 10k, so forgive any ignorance or poor understanding on my part. 

For a long time I think a lot of people's problem with NFLX has been that while their customer acquisition and subscription model has been relatively successful,  their implied valuation has not been justifiable due to poor content acquisition economics. This meaning that NFLX has had to pay enormous licensing and rights fees to provide their streaming content which *they don't own*. As a result, FCF has not been there (TTM is -$543mm). 

What got me thinking about a shift in their overall business model was over the week as I finished up their new Original series Narcos. It always struck me as impressive that every Netflix Original series has seemed to do very well - House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, and Narcos to name a few. However, when I looked into it I saw that Netflix is the publisher of well over a dozen originals that range from documentaries to children's shows. 

So this leads me to ask the following questions about NFLX's business that I thought we could brainstorm on:

* What is the ROIC on publishing original content? 

* Is the mix of original content greater than, or could it eventually exceed, the amount of licensed content NFLX streams?

* What potential effect could a greater mix of original content have on customer acquisition economics vs. competing streaming services such as Hulu?

t3_3l4ojn,WYNN Revisited,"I thought I would post a new thread on WYNN since I am going to throw out some numbers to hang a value on Wynn. These numbers are rough, but it is a starting point. Wynn Resorts owns 72% of Wynn Macau, 100% of Wynn Las Vegas, and 100% of Wynn America (Boston). WYNN has 101.5 million shares outstanding.

&nbsp;

Macau:  
 - Last quarter the Macau property did $175M EBITDA. Annualized that is $700M.  
 - The new property will be in a better location and should do more EBITDA, but it will probably cannibalize the old one for some time. Let's assume that the two properties do $1.4B of EBITDA after the dust settles. 
 - Im estimating that the Macau box will need to increase debt load to finish off the Cotai property and will have around $4B of net debt after the property is complete.  
 - Assume Macau is worth 12x EBITDA  
 - $16,800M Enterprise Value ($1.4B * 12)  
 - $4000M Net Debt  
 - $12,800 Equity Value  
 - x72%  
= $9216M Equity Value to WYNN or $90.8/share

&nbsp;

Las Vegas:  
 - The LV box did $475M EBITDA LTM  
 - Assume it is worth 11x  
 - $5225 Enterprise Value  
 - $5200M of Debt at that Box  
 = Not Much Equity Value  

&nbsp;

Boston:  
 - Im assuming Boston does $250M of EBITDA (about half what the two LV casinos are doing - I really dont know). I googled Wynn America financing and found a Moody's piece that shows it is being financed with $375M revolver and $875M term loan. I guess the balance of the cost of the new property will be cash taken from the Las Vegas and Macau boxes.  
 - Assume it is worth 9x EBTIDA  
 - $2250 Enterprise Value  
 - $1250 Debt  
 = $1000B Equity Value or $10/share  

&nbsp;

Sum of the Parts:
 - $90.8/sh for Macau  
 - $0.0/sh for Las Vegas  
 - $10.0/sh for Boston  
 = ~$100/sh

&nbsp;

If you believe that Macau has bottomed and will return to growth in the medium term, the stock is probably cheap. If you think Macau has farther to fall, the stock is likely not cheap. One thing I want to point out is that I am counting the roughly $2B of notes that that was used to redeem the shares of that dude Wynn booted off the board a while back as debt against the Las Vegas box. I'm not endorsing this valuation, I just wanted to put some rough numbers on it if anyone wants to use it as a springboard to do their own work.

t3_3obyhy,Valeant's dirty accounting,"It's curious to me that Valeant is aggressively accelerating amortization.  In fact I think it's a baffling finding (see edit below for what I think is going on).  This is, of course, the biggest component of their CFFO, and accounts for the majority of the discrepancy between GAAP net income and CFFO.

Keep in mind that this is not a part of their ""business model"" of being acquisitive and cutting out fat.  Amortization of intangibles is purely tapping into reserves on acquisitions they've already paid for.  The intangible gets booked on to their balance sheet via the acquisitions line on Financing Cash Flows in a prior period.  All they're doing is recognizing acquisition expenses from prior years as cash flow in subsequent years.  The progression through time is Cash Flows From Investing (CF statement) --> Intangible Assets (Balance Sheet) --> Amortization (Income Statement) --> Cash Flows From Operations (CF statement).  The analogue to this is capital expenditures --> PP&E --> depreciation --> CFFO.  You use the former for intangibles and the latter for tangibles.



I take serious issue with the way they account for ""cash flow EPS"" as their metric for performance.  It's based off of elements that are only contained within CFFO but do not consider acquisition costs.  Conglomerates in the past have done this and it's deceptive because it dupes cash-focused investors.  Anyone who seriously wanted to gauge management's performance for a conglomerate would subtract acquisition costs from CFFO (as well as the usual capex), reason being that if acquisitions are within the normal business model of the company then acquisition costs should be treated as an expense.  In companies that grow organically, CFFO captures both revenues and expenses, which is a decent metric once you adjust for capital expenditures.  But for companies that are acquisitive, part of the expenses get shifted down the cash flow statement under Investing activities and get missed by traditional FCF measures.  So any metric for valuation that doesn't account for acquisition costs misses this major expense -- whether it's in the form of a multiple that includes amortization, such as EBITA/EBITDA, or discounted cash flows using FCF (CFFO-CapEx).

Disclosure: I am a long-only investor and hold no position in VRX.

Edited for clarity: accelerating amortization does nothing in and of itself to boost CFFO, but is a curious finding.  My best guess is that accelerating amortization is another way of writing off poor acquisitions from the past.  If investors use FCF or EBITA/EBITDA for valuation then the ""write-off"" gets baked into the ultimate valuation of the company.  In contrast, immediately expensing the write-off would not have this effect.

The next obvious question is: if management is admitting their intangibles are duds, then shouldn't they impair goodwill as well? Under GAAP you can't use the accelerated amortization trick to mask write-offs on goodwill since the rules have changed. Instead, you're required to periodically test it for impairment and write it down if book value exceeds fair value.

I have less evidence for this but what I will point out is that goodwill is impaired on a reporting unit level. This means all of the goodwill gets pooled into one account and considered as a whole. If one acquisition is a dud, you don't need to write it down if the rest of it is intact. So one thing you can do to get around writing off goodwill is to consolidate your reporting units. This is exactly what Valeant has been doing. From 2012-2013 they combined reporting segments (from 4 to 2). I don't know how much more consolidated you can get. The interesting thing is that when you do something like that, you're required to retrospectively make similar changes to prior periods for comparability. This gives you some limited insight into what those changes were. I'll spare you the gruesome details unless you want it, but the entire composition of ""Emerging Markets"" went from one of profitability to much less profitable/negative profits in some years. Yet in their disclosures they still state that Poland, Russia, Asia, Latin America, and Africa are within the category -- from both before and after reorganization. How can you retain the geographic composition of the ""Emerging Markets"" category yet have such dramatic changes in profits? My best guess is that they're burying losses by remixing the reporting units, and that way they're avoiding goodwill write-offs.",11,0.87,1444572617,"[['FCF', 3]]",FCF,9.149999618530273,9.199999809265137

The main reason for this is that even the large cap biotech names are often based on a single substantial product, one that will eventually expire, and you'll have to SPECULATE on how they could create shareholder value once that time comes. Gilead Science is a great example with their Hep C drug that has turned them into a household name in the industry, however, the stock has begun trading down lately with fears that they wont be able to create share holder value past their Hep C drug which they have exclusivity on for a few more years.

t3_3p7qqe,My Value + growth selection,"GILD and MU.

Gilead Sciences is currently trading 10.8 times TTM earnings. Generally, biotech stocks trade for far more, as they are perceived to have significant growth potential. With the chance of a revolutionary discovery, superb margins, and extremely good recent performance, it might even make sense. Gilead Sciences Inc is very cheap relative to the category. And that's not because they're a poor company. They have a rich pipeline, excellent margins and a very large competitive competitive advantage in the Hep C market, through Harvoni. The patent expires in 2018, meaning that they have 3 years before they'll need to find a new source of revenue. Currently, they have 3 HIV drugs pending regulatory approval. They're relatively weak outside of their niche (Hep C), perhaps making an acquisition a possibility.

The company faces many unique  challenges, although I still think the upside is greater than the downside. These risks include:

-Competition
-Legislative risks (notably, Hillary Clinton has expressed interest in regulating the price of drugs)
-Dependence on Harvoni

Competitors to Harvoni are still in early development, there is a strong lobby that would oppose an increase in prices, and they currently have many drugs in the pipeline, 3 years before the Harvoni patent expires, as well as the chance for an acquisition. I don't believe the aforementioned risks make a significant position in GILD excessively risky. I rate GILD a strong buy, on the basis of low valuation and significant potential. 

Micron Technology is currently trading 6.2x TTM earnings, after a small rally from 15 to 18.5 dollars. Following the latest earnings report, MU was beaten down 20%, falling further the following months. At one point, the stock was trading under stock+cash per share, and currently, it's trading 1.6x book value. If you asked me, this is extremely low valuation for a high-tech semiconductor company. MU produces NAND and DRAM, critical parts of high-tech computer products. Think of them as making chips that all smartphones, data centres and computers need. If you think people will buy a lot of those in the future, a stock like MU lets you profit without buying the companies directly. With all this talk of the next billion, the post-PC era and the power of the cloud, it seems like the future of computing can go many ways. And with overvalued, ovethyped companies like Salesforce, a cheaply valued company that profits no matter who else does seems like a dream come true. However, you still need to know about the bear in the room: MU's bad quarter. Reading the 10-Q shows that margin reductions appear again and again. Quite simply, they sold more, but sold it for less. The reductions in DRAM prices were too fast, and they couldn't reduce the production costs quuckly enough to keep up. They'll need new technology to maintain healthy margins. They happen to have a partnership with Intel, working on creating a new form of memory that seems nearly revolutionary. 3dXpoint memory is poised to be 1000x times faster than NAND, meaning that large data centres have access to a new product that vastly outperforms their old one, letting them work with extremely large amounts of data. However, Micron is not without unique risks:

-Margins worsening further
-3dXpoint not delivering what was promised
-Weakening PC/mobile/datacenter markets

These risks are significant, no doubt. I advise caution when considering stock allocation, as it depends on how bullish you are on the future of the PC markets. I consider MU  a buy; or a strong buy if you're bullish on computing.

Right now in the third quarter, 44 of our top 100 customers are negative. We have not lost any business with that group. They are negative in their spend. In some cases, they are negative because their business is very negative and they are somewhat negative with us. In some case, their business is treading water and they decided to tighten their belt. I mean, look at our capex next year - there is going to be suppliers to our capital spend that will have a tighter year in 2016 than they have in 2015, because we’re not automating two, three, four distribution centers in the next 12 months.

>Of that 44 that were negative, 32 of them were negative more than 10%. Of that 44 that’s negative, 17 of them were negative more than 25%. That’s a sign of a recessionary environment, because despite all that, we continue to add customers at a faster pace than we’ve done in recent years, which is about momentum into the future. We continue to grow our national account business, which is about momentum, but we have existing customers that are struggling through a pretty weak environment in their own business.

* Has had 99.5% capacity utilization rate during MANU games for the past 15 years, meaning regardless of the team's performance (this is greater than the 80% average at Camp Nou)

* CapEx for the company ranges from 5 to 15mn GBP ($7.5mn-$22.5mn USD), averages out to 10mn GBP over the past 5 years with no notable expansions over that time period, so a reliable estimate of maintenance capex

* Held on book at 220mn GBP/$335mn along with a training facility dedicated to MANU's team which was built before 2000

* Is defined as an ""Asset of Communal Value"" to Manchester, where the team can't sell it until the local Manchester United Support Trusts make a bid for it - obviously would look bad to not sell there, so actual cash generation could be limited (this includes if the company wants to perform a sale lease-back, though there is collateralized debt on the balance sheet that is secured by the stadium)

* Analysts estimate naming rights could go for $1bn gross in 20-year contract due to MANU fan-base size, but management has said they are against selling the naming rights due to the facility's historical value

* Can invest 100mn GBP/$152mn to expand capacity by 25% to 95,000, which could increase revenue by 25% that should mostly fall through to the bottom line - and MANU has this cash on hand if it wants to do it - IRR after ~40% tax = ~15%, or CF of $20-25mn.  This would make it the largest stadium in England and the 2nd largest in Europe

**Asset's Revenue Info** (I want to exclude this from the analysis and include it as a cash flow value, but if you have some input please advise)

* Last year it generated 90mn GBP/~$140mn in revenue for Manchester United, down from 110mn GBP/~$165mn year over year due to Manchester United's failure to qualify for the Champion's league (MANU is in *this* year's champions league, so revenue should go back up)

* Costs to service the facility are included on MANU's income statement, and EBITDA margin is ~20% while EBIT margin is ~10%

**Other Stadium Info/Comparables**

* Hard to find, but saw that the Dallas Cowboys spent $1.2bn building the new AT&T stadium, which has a capacity of ~80,000. Maybe you could argue similar value to MANU.  They sold their naming rights for an estimated $17-19mn in a long-term contract that is 1/3rd the estimated cash flow MANU could generate

I'm finding it difficult to ascribe a value to something that is a historical landmark, but cannot be easily liquidated.  MANU trades at a premium to the typical company at 16x TEV/TTM EBITDA (according to CIQ screen) but how much the intrinsic company's value is is what I'm trying to derive.",8,0.75,1447871175,"[['MANU', 5], ['IRR', 1], ['CF', 1]]",MANU,18.360000610351562,18.459999084472656
t3_3tgv5u,Are negative foreign currency impacts the biggest cop-out ever?,"This post will make it it glaringly obvious how little I know about currencies and FX, but I'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction. 

With the strong dollar we've had a lot of businesses with international exposure are having their bottom line hurt as a result of negative foreign currency impacts. I can only think of few companies where this hasn't been a problem when reporting earnings over the past year or so. 

My question is, is writing off a hurt bottom line because of the impact of FX really a legitimate reason to be concerned about a companies health? To me, its not. Using the example of PG, they had problems with this over the past year but if you dig deeper YoY unit sales increased in the areas affected, so the hurt bottom line is not the result of deteriorating fundamentals but rather a broader macro effect. I also know that regarding PG they're undergoing restructuring and what not, but I think it was a good example to use. 

Other times I feel that management talks about FX impact as a way to cover up lower demand for their products/services, and its an easy way to write off poor earnings. Can't think of an example of this one off the top of my head. 

Whats everyones take on this? ",12,0.93,1447959836,"[['PG', 1]]",PG,75.68000030517578,76.37000274658203
t3_3unxbv,Morgans Hotel Group (MHGC): >100% upside from current prices,"Morgans owns two related but distinct businesses. Firstly, they own, operate and manage three hotels in Manhattan, Miami and San Francisco. Secondly they run an asset-light hotel management business, which also acts as a licensor of its Morgans, Delano, Mondrian and Hudson boutique brands.  

MHGC is currently trading at around $3.20/share. I believe MHGC will be worth $7.73 within the next year, which represents a 134% return from current prices and as such offers a very compelling risk/reward opportunity. 
 
The Morgans board has been trying to effect a transaction for nearly 3 years but has failed for 2 reasons. Firstly, the slightly awkward makeup of the company means that there are few single buyers who will be interested in both parts of the company, making a sale of the company relatively more difficult to negotiate. However, more important is the fact that the board has been divided over what the best course of action should be. There is also the overhang of the preferred shares owned by Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa, which I will elaborate on later. As a result, both management and the board have lost credibility with the market, and the stock price has plummeted by over 50% ytd.  
  
I value the Hudson in Manhattan and Delano South Beach properties at around $600m together. The Hudson is located near Columbus Circle in a very valuable location. NOI for the Hudson was around $16m for 2014 and NOI for The Delano was around $15m. I used a cap rate of ~5% and $/key of around $400,000 to value the Hudson and a cap rate of ~6.25% and $/key of 1m for the Delano. Comps I used for the Hudson include the acquisition of the Sofitel NYC by Keck Seng Investments, the acquisition of the Times Square Hotel by the Qatar Group and the acquisition of the Palce Hotel by the Lotte Group. Comps for the Delano included the sales of the SLS South Beach and the James Royal Palm hotel.
 
Currently the hotel management segment of the company is earning around $15m-16m run-rate 2015. Including fees from owned hotels, sales would come to around $23m-25m. If we assume a 37% SGA haircut on sales (consistent with comps: Marriott, Choice Hotels and Starwood), EBITDA should be around $15m. The driver of value for this business is the strength of its brands; MHGC has a great track record of managing hotels: every single hotel managed by MHGC is rated 4 stars or higher on Tripadvisor and sales at thehotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas increased by 30% and jumped by over 100 spots on Tripadvisor after rebranding to Delano Mandalay Bay last year. MHGC’s brand equity and character provides clear differentiation from competitors. There is also a lot of potential for growth (6 signed contracts in the pipeline and each contract is material to MHGC given that EBITDA is only currently around $15m). 

The main weakness of the business is that it lacks the scale of chain like Kimpton (which had 70 hotels in its network when it was sold to Intercontinental Hotels), and thus has a loyalty scheme that isn’t as extensive as its rivals. Asset light hotel management businesses generally trade at between 12x and 17x EV/EBITDA multiples. As such I think a 15x EBITDA multiple is conservative here, giving us a value of around $225m for the business.
 
Currently, total liabilities are comprised of $600m worth of debt, which includes a $400m non-recourse Hudson/Delano mortgage loan as well as the $94m lease for the Clift hotel in San Francisco. In addition, Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa owns $75m worth of preferred shares, and the company owes Yucaipa $50m of accrued preferred dividends. Yucaipa also owns warrants to purchase 12,500,000 shares of Morgans at $6.00, which is expiring in a year. Assuming a target price of $7.60, the warrants will be worth $19.2m.
 
Taking into account the property assets worth $600m, the hotel management company valued at $225m, and assuming a haircut of 90% on the NOLs worth $380m which is $38m (back of the envelope I admit, but I think it is conservative) and subtracting the net debt of $550m minus the lease of around $94m, preferred shares of $75m, accrued dividends of $50m and warrants worth $13m, the equity is worth $239m, which is around $7.73/share. 
 
On September of 2015, a few weeks ago, Rambleside Holdings, an investment firm specializing in real estate assets and securities and one of the largest shareholders of the company offered to buy the Hudson and Delano for $507m, which is lower than our valuation for the 2 hotels but still higher than the value implied by current market prices. I believe this puts a floor on the value of the hotel properties at $507m.
 
The dividend yield on Burkle’s preferred dividends will increase to 20% from 10%, thus there is an incentive for the company to redeem the shares before this happens. Currently the firm has around $50m in cash. To redeem the shares, the company will need to raise capital, most likely by selling its two hotel properties.
 
The key risk to the thesis is the role of Ron Burkle in this whole process. As the owner of the firm’s preferred shares, his interests may not be aligned with the common shareholders. Moreover, his ownership of the preferred shares gives him certain consent rights over asset sales as well as potential acquisition of MHGC by a third party, and so he has significant influence over the value of the company. It is possible for him acquire the firm's hotel assets at an artificially low price. Theoretically he can refuse consent to the sale of the properties to a third party, essentially becoming the only viable buyer. In this worst case scenario, the firm will be a price taker, since they will be forced to sell the assets at Burkle's price.

Catalysts:

* Announcement of new CEO
* Sale of hotel properties (1 year time frame)
* Redemption of preferred shares
* Continued growth of hotel management segment

t3_3vq9gj,Why are restaurant valuations where they are?,"Looking into restaurants because a fund I know of is looking to hire a restaurant analyst - they are value based. Of the ones I follow the valuations are a little egregious on both TEV/EBITDA and P/E ratios. For Example:

* CMG at 17x TEV/EBITDA and 33x P/E
* MCD at 14x TEV/EBITDA and 24x P/E
* BWLD at 12.5x TEV/EBITDA and 34x P/E

The more reasonable I see right now is CAKE at 9x TEV/EBITDA and 20x P/E., a little more acceptable but still pretty aggressive.

I can understand something being at a higher TEV/EBITDA with higher growth expected but when I look at something at 15x TEV/EBITDA and 25x earnings I can't help but be skeptical. I was looking at DRI which is at a 10x TEV/EBITDA and 25x earnings and just spun off their real-estate (implying a higher forward TEV/EBITDA for the current valuation, as they will need to start paying higher rental expenses). With the spin it's hard to recomend there is underlying value in the assets since they were literally just sold, and instead we'd need to look at a restructuring and cost cutting to promote above-market growth rates in the restaurant space if the asset ownership is minimal.

What's the deal? Is this all looking at underlying real estate, or is the market being overly enthusiastic as it looks for growth?

I would really appreciate help on the following question on what seems to be a widely used ratio when looking at stocks. I'm still at high school, don't invest but am very interested in how stock analysis works. But baby steps first...

So: with price earnings if a stock is currently trading on say 15x and 10x next year, what do I take from that? 

1) Does it mean that investors should wait until next year to invest ie when it is cheaper? 
2) Are current and forward PE calculated using the current share price then dividing by this year's EPS and then NEXT year's EPS for the forward PE? 
3) This is the one I have trouble with... A high PE would imply the company is growing in terms of earnings, BUT surely if the EPS is high/growing then the PE should be lower as that number can be divided into the current share price fewer times? 

I hope these questions make sense - as said, any guidance or links to useful explanations would be great.

t3_3zw0dk,CLD Investment Brief,"Note: This is not professional investment advice. The following is a brief I wrote for myself and update periodically. I chose to publish it up for critique. 
---

Buy CLD common stock in the $2 area and hold to sell at $16 or higher. The buy-in target reflects an 85% discount to tangible book value. With the stock currently selling at less than two times free cash flow, CLD possesses a huge margin of safety. 

Cloud Peak Energy is a holding company that manages its 100% owned subsidiary, Cloud Peak Energy Resources. The Company is a producer of coal in the USA and the Powder River basin (PRB). The Company operates in three segments: Owned and Operated Mines, Logistics and Related Activities, and Corporate and Other. The Owned and Operated Mines segment focuses on thermal coal production. The Logistics and Related Activities segment delivers coal to the customer at a terminal or the customer’s plant or other delivery point, remote from its mine site. The Corporate and Other segment include results relating to broker activity, its share of the Decker mine operations. 

The current price of CLD common stock has been pounded by rapidly falling coal prices. This negative pressure is due to: (a) the vast quantities of natural gas available; (b) weak demand and significant oversupply for both thermal and metallurgical coal due to slower than expected economic growth in both the United States and overseas markets (such as China, the largest user of met and thermal coal in the world); (c) the imposition of restrictive regulations around coal; and (d) amendments to transportation and throughput agreements. 

CLD is one of the lowest cost producers in the industry and is currently one of the few coal companies with both positive EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Current free cash flow per share is $1.39, and this is under terrible industry conditions. This means that the common stock currently sells at less than two times free cash flow. 

The only risk CLD has is industry risk. It poses no significant credit risk.  
It has two fixed rate senior note issues outstanding (8.50% 2019 $300M / 6.375% 2024 $200M) and a capital leasing program. 
CLD possesses sufficient liquidity - through cash ($123.5M), FCF ($34M), as well as an undrawn revolver ($500M) and an undrawn A/R Securitization facility ($45.2M).  
Both the revolver and the A/R securitization facility carry variable rates, which may pose a risk if drawn. The capital leasing program ($7.8M of borrowings) also carries variable rates, however the impact on cash flow from a rise in rates would not be significant. 
The covenants on the credit agreement include the following: 
EBITDA/Cash Interest Expense ≥ 1.50 
Net Secured Debt/EBITDA ≤4 
TTM EBITDA > $125M 
CLD is in full compliance of all the covenants, with 2.12 EBITDA/Cash Interest Expense and $167.4M TTM adjusted EBITDA.
* Note that the EBITDA calculation in the Credit Agreement differs from the standard calculation. Under the notes’ covenants dividends and repurchases are also limited. 

The equity unquestionably has incredible upside potential. You can buy CLD common stock for less than two times free cash flow and at a discount of 85% to tangible book value. This is for a company with 14.37% average five-year return on equity and 8.69% average five-year return on invested capital.

For those even more cautious, the notes are guaranteed by subsidiaries with more than enough asset coverage. The 2019 notes are currently selling in the low 50s territory - most likely due to being subordinated to the revolver, which has a first priority lien on all assets except the LBA leases. Note that at the moment the revolver stands undrawn.

Good because of the financial position of the company, cigar butt because of price and lack of short-term catalysts other than industry sentiment improvement and a credit upgrade.",3,0.67,1452181695,"[['FCF', 1], ['TTM', 1]]",FCF,8.59000015258789,8.300000190734863

With the stock down 45% in the past year, Kors has suffered from consensus selling of the consumer apparel space as peers such as RL (-41%), FOSL (-71%), KATE (-41%), M (-41%) as well as some idiosyncratic issues since the company has failed to grow overall same store sales in the past three Qs. Management has cited the reason for weaker same store growth comes from a shift into smaller handbags for women, thereby reducing KORS sales of its higher margin products. 

However, longer term I think the core drivers for the business are intact 1) international growth remains an area of opportunity as European revenues have grown at a 100% CAGR from FY12-FY15 and even if projected to grow at a slowing rate, can be expected to drive incremental growth in CY17. 2) Wholesale distribution strategy remains intact with a 16% CAGR in CY13-15 in wholesale revenue. Kors holds key relationships with its distributors, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Neiman Marcus to name a few. 3) As marketing increasingly shifts to digital through social media and mobile, Kors holds a competitive advantage to peers. For a basic check - Kors with 17M Facebook likes outstrips peers with higher revenue bases such as Ralph Lauren with 8.4M likes, Coach with 6M likes. With improvements to its online sales and distribution channel, Kors holds an opportunity to capture share moving forward as global consumers spend online. 

When comparing the valuation vs. comparables, the difference is substantial. Kors trades at only 5X 2016 EBITDA, 12.5X FCF, 9x EPS in spite of 11% revenue growth in 2015 and 5% in 2016. This compares its peers such as RL at 8.5X EBITDA and 20X FCF with 3% growth in 2015, KATE at 9X EBITDA and 21X FCF 8% growth in CY15. The company has no substantial debt vs $430M in cash and inventory levels, receivables, and payables remain at historical levels as a % of revenues. Despite being one of the highest margin businesses in consumer retail at 25% operating margins, the stock trades at one of the lowest valuations, signaling that investors have priced in Kors products are oversaturated and expect FCF / EBIT to decline significantly in to 2016. For the company’s valuation to be in line to peers at ~20x FCF, 2016 FCF would need to decrease by 35%. Any strength in either growth or margins outside of the 35% decline may presents upside to the stock which seems like a favorable set up. 

In the past two quarters, Greenlight capital has also been accumulating 7M shares, its third largest position, and 5% of its fund. Looking through their shareholder letter, Greenlight also cites valuation and lack of distribution disruptions as areas of upside for the stock. 

Catalyst

Although pure discount in valuation may not be a sole catalyst for a stock, I think over time investors will recognized Kors is a severely discounted asset. Fiscal Q3 earnings may provide some of this evidence as the company posts holiday sales numbers, and FQ4 may be the next catalyst as the company posts initial FY17 guidance. For FY17, I am expecting $4,830M in revenues and $1,155M in operating income, relatively in line with sell side consensus. 

Risk

One area of concern is that a Google trend search for Kors shows a decline in YoY interest while peers such as KATE has witnessed an increase. Although some deceleration is probably baked into expectations, if the company misses guidance, valuations could further compress.",9,0.76,1452461362,"[['FCF', 4], ['RL', 2], ['FOSL', 1], ['M', 1]]",FCF,8.550000190734863,8.380000114440918

FELP may have to accelerate payment of 606 million to creditors as a result of a recent adverse court ruling.  

Given all this info I have a few questions..

1) Is it possible for FELP to raise additional credit financing to pay off the 606 million given the state of the coal industry and high yield energy credit generally?

2) How do coal investors think about reserves valuation? Assuming a 90% discount and $10 pt the value of the reserves is still 3 billion.

t3_41hjhe,Building more sophisticated financial models and understanding operating leverage,"Hi everyone. First time poster here. Would love to hear the community's thoughts on how they create more useful financial models. Specifically, how do you look at fixed vs variable cost breakdowns to estimate incremental margins? And how do you estimate EBITDA or EBIT break-even points? It's very nice when EBITDA break-evens and/or contribution margins are laid out in IR presentations and the like, but that's the exception and not the norm.

I'm a big fan of avoiding precision bias, so I'll usually focus on more qualitative factors than the typical trend extrapolation that dominates a lot of investment analysis. I see quite a few analysts setting SG&A to an average percentage of sales over the last 3 - 5 years and then adding small incremental improvements per year without a strong grounding in the unit economics of the business, and this seems like lunacy to me. But qualitative factors don't matter much without a quantitative framework - for example, knowing that there's a lot of excess capacity is great, but it's most helpful if I can understand it in the context of what incremental margins look like.

I sometimes try extrapolating EBIT growth divided by revenue growth to get a sense for operating leverage, but it's a very Rube Goldberg way of doing things and not necessarily indicative of what's going to happen going forward. Another way is looking at competitors with lower relative cost structures and estimating that the target improves over a number of years to hit that target, but this option isn't always useful or even available (sometimes there's no applicable competitor/peer group). I'll also compare quarter-over-quarter increases of EBIT and revenue and can get a sense for incremental EBIT margin that way. This last way seems like the best way to me, but there's usually so much noise that it's not frequently accurate.

Anyone else have a good way for quantifying this sort of marginal analysis?",9,0.86,1453095132,"[['IR', 1]]",IR,20.270000457763672,21.299999237060547

t3_41xkz1,On Shorting E&P Companies,"I had a friend recently ask me about what my thoughts were over shorting E&P stocks. I wrote back with the following. Curious to know what y'alls thoughts are. 

To me most of the shorts have played out. It's very expensive to short most of these midcap/smallcap E&P's and they're already trading at pennies; additionally, the decline in oil prices has been priced in. At this point if you want to short one of these stocks you'd need some type of catalyst beyond oil price declines. 

For me shorting most of these distressed E&P's that are trading at pennies is a strategy very similar to merger arbitrage at this point. You're betting on a bankruptcy to trigger the equity value going to zero. You can target a number of operators whose debts are trading at >$.70 on the dollar and that are most likely to violate their credit agreements in the next 3-6 months. The risk you're taking is if they get acquired or have successful asset sales to avoid triggering a bk / are able to work out an agreement w/ their creditor. 

I see more compelling longs in guys like PXD/ FANG that have recently been able to raise equity and have cash on hand to make some great acquisitions and build out their portfolio. Between assets sales from E&P's trying to stay afloat and from bankruptcy proceedings its a buyer's market and they could be well positioned for a rebound in the oil market. 

From a macro perspective it's always darkest before dawn, and looking at how last crash played out, when oil rebounded, it rebounded hard. Here are some of the things I'm thinking about:

- Announced 2016 Capex for E&P's is 30%+ down from last year, probably even more now since most guys were determining off of $40 oil

- Declines on shale wells are very steep, usually 50+% in the first year, people or underestimated how quickly production can roll off

- Looking at what caused the current crash: sluggish demand and oversupply in from NAM fracking producing light sweet crude that yields an large amount of gasoline compared to heavier crudes like Bahrain or Maya. This was the reason the fracking revolution was such a market shock, it's not just the amount of production, but the actual product. In thinking about what has traditionally driven oil prices: it's gasoline demand for US in the summer and gasoil demand for Europe in the winter. The former was impacted by domestic light sweet crude becoming abundant the latter was impacted by a mild winter. The point I'm trying to make is that the stars really aligned for this drop to happen

- On Iran/Saudi, with the current instability you'd figure it'd increase the price of oil; really though, there's a convexity in the price of oil relative to the Saudi-Iran relationship. If Saudi/Iran were to get along or at least be bearable to each other then that would allow OPEC to have more strength in establishing and enforcing quotas. Since the recent slaying of Shia muslims in Saudi Arabia the likelihood of the Saudis and Iran colluding has gone to zero, in fact the opposite is going to happen. Saudi Arabia's main goal throughout the last 6 months has been to keep Iran weak. People think the Saudis increased production to kill the US fracking industry - really they could care less - most geopolitical experts like Gen. Petraeus agree that ever since sanctions have been lifted on Iran the new Saudi goal has been to protect itself from Iran. The main strategy has been to prevent Iran's oil and gas industry from being able to get off the ground in part by tanking the price of oil, thereby starving Iran of cash, the recent execution of Shia muslims was most likely a deliberate attempt to further provoke Iran. Where the convexity kicks in is that if hostilities between the two countries were to escalate to the point of war then you'd see an increase in the price of oil - both countries reserves lie in the Persian Gulf in between each other. 

- Taking the aforementioned points in mind there's a good case to be made for potential oil recovery, any black-swan event I can think of would bias towards increasing the price of oil. My only real fear is if we enter a recession globally, and it seems like it could be a very real possibility - then all bets are off.",10,0.92,1453340275,"[['FANG', 1]]",FANG,60.599998474121094,73.48999786376953

t3_44c74r,Long PLOW Writeup,"**INTRODUCTION**

I believe that Mr. Market is currently offering Douglas Dynamics (PLOW) at a 30% discount to intrinsic value. 

As North America’s premier manufacturer of snow plows, de-icing equipment, and vehicle attachments, Douglas Dynamics possesses two formidable moats stemming from their ability to produce high-quality products more cheaply than their competitors, and then selling those products through an extensive network of dealers.  

Further, the company has significant advantages in the shareholder-oriented management team, a high free cash flow conversion rate, low capital spending requirements, and a largely variable cost structure. These considerations make Douglas Dynamics a company that can weather most any storm (pun intended). 

An unseasonably warm winter in Douglas Dynamics’s core markets has driven the stock down to $18.50---offering investors the opportunity to buy a great company at only 10X earnings,  a 12.5% FCF yield, and a 19% operating earnings yield! Additionally, management is dedicated to paying a significant dividend (5% current yield) under all weather conditions, without sacrificing near- or long-term liquidity. 

**WHY IS IT CHEAP?**

The primary factor weighing on Douglas Dynamics’s stock is the psychological tendency to overweight near-term salient factors (what Munger calls the “availability-misweighing tendency""), which in this case is the impact the warm winter will have on the company's core markets. With temperatures pushing 70 degrees on Christmas in much of the Northeast and little indication of snow, it is easy to discount a business whose prosperity presupposes wintry conditions. 

Looking at a small sample size, snowfall amounts indeed appear to be highly varied and unpredictable. But by widening the sample to Douglas's 66 core cities, we get a consistent rolling ten-year average annual snowfall of 3,100 inches. The market appears to be over-focusing on the short-term catalyst of heavy snow fall (or lack thereof), and overlooking longer-term factors, such as the high quality of the business and management's record of prudent capital allocation. 

With an estimated 600K units in use, and an average 7 - 8 year replacement cycle (at $5K - $9K each for light-duty mounted plow), Douglas Dynamics can count on a continual demand for products---even if that demand may be uneven. Because snow poses a grave and immediate threat to public safety and productivity, there will always exist a critical need to quickly remove it from roads. In short, it is not a matter of if customers will buy Douglas Dynamics products, but when. 

Despite the ill effects that a mild winter will no doubt have on Douglas Dynamics, the market has likely overreacted in the short term---presenting patient investors an attractive opportunity to buy a high-quality business trading at a 30% discount to intrinsic value.

t3_44bry4,Long HBP Write Up,"**Business Description**

Huttig Building Products, Inc. [NASDAQ: HBP] (“Huttig” or the “Company”) is an 81.6mn market cap U.S. housing supply company headquarted in St. Louis, Missouri. Huttig has a rich corporate history dating back to 1885, and over the years have positioned themselves as a dominant middleman between product manufactures and their customers in the local markets they service.

 Through its distribution centers, Huttig supplies millwork and building products (88% of revenue) (doors, windows, stair components, and molding) used in residential construction and remodeling and wood products (12% of revenue) (flooring systems, panels, and lumber) to an established network of specialty dealers and general retailers.

Huttig’s value add is two-fold. Their national distribution footprint provides the Company with economies of scale that offer customers access to a broader range of inventory than they normally would have access to at a more attractive price than what a manufacturer would charge, as well as next-day delivery on orders. Additionally, Huttig performs post-purchase processing on products to job-specific configurations needed by end customers, something that manufacturers with standardized SKUs are often not able to perform. 


**Investment Thesis**

* HBP will compound at a double digit rate over the next 5 years, driven by (1) bottom-line margin expansion from 0.4% to 1.3%, (2) cash margin expansion from 0.3% to 2.5%, and (3) increased analyst coverage and street visibility with upcoming management change.
* Bottom-line margin expansion will be driven by (1) 4-6% top-line growth as HBP’s serviceable market grows faster than the market is expecting, and (2) incremental cost savings as top-line growth outpaces growth in fixed variable fuel and wage expenses.

* Cash margin expansion will be driven by (1) unlocking of $107mn worth of net operating loss carry-forwards (NOLs) that the market has not recognized, (2) NOL contribution of an average $14.6mn to free cash flow over the next 5 years.

* Recruitment of a new CFO is focused on identifying candidates with extensive M&A and investor relations experience; street visibility will be considerably increased once a qualified CFO has been recruited along with a free option on any future accretive M&A. 

**Valuation**

I value HBP on 2017 FCF. HBP trades at 7.0x FCF, and I conservatively assume this multiple in my methodology to arrive at the Company’s various valuation scenarios despite the higher comps average. A DCF valuation of HBP also yields similar results to my P/FCF valuation.

My valuation yields a base price target of $5.09, 55.1% upside to current price. Bull case price target of $5.96, 81.7% upside to current price. My bear case price target of $3.01, -8.2% downside to current price. I believe my valuation scenarios result in an asymmetric risk/reward profile for the Company.

t3_456ivm,A napkin valuation of Amazon’s buyback,"So we know that Amazon just announced a $5 billion buyback. In what world does that sound like a good idea? 

Amazon’s P/E is currently 400, give or take a bit. To justify that valuation, either one or both of these has to be true: i) earnings are apparently but not intrinsically depressed, or ii) there is tremendous future growth. I’m thinking that both assumptions have to be in play for a P/E of 400 to exist. 

Let us assume for a second that earnings have been depressed by 4x, while the remainder “intrinsic P/E” of 100 is attributable to growth. Let’s tackle the first assumption first. Bull case says that it is cash flow that matters, not earnings. Well, we know two myths about the cash flow vs earnings argument. 

One, Amazon is investing in CAPEX for growth, hence the depressed earnings. We know this is not the case, as CAPEX would be capitalized on the balance sheet without affecting earnings. Furthermore, the bulk of expenses are categorized under the line item *Fulfillment*. This implies that most of the expenses are attributable to operating costs, not R&D. Even if we give the benefit of doubt, there is no reason why R&D should take up 40% of revenues. Even half of that would be excessive. One might make the argument that Amazon is accelerating depreciation of warehouses, by far their biggest cash flow expenditure, in favour of conservative accounting. Starbucks did this in the late 90’s, according to Penman’s book. However, we can see that is not the case, as *depreciation/amortization* is its own line item – and it is insignificant, less than 3% revenues. So we’re really left scratching our heads about where fulfilment expenses are coming from. 

Secondly, we know that Amazon is basically an online Walmart. Which means they have negative working capital. What this means is that they accept goods from suppliers, sell them first, and only then do they pay them back 30-60 days later. This is immensely advantageous, as it acts as a gigantic float. Having said that, it also obscures true free cash flow at year end. We know that Amazon’s biggest sales are during the holiday seasons of Christmas and New Year’s. Thus, they can report huge upfront operating cash flows before they’re paid to suppliers as part of FCF – which actually doesn’t belong to them. So much for the cash flow argument. 


What about growth? Well, a reverse DCF shows that a 100x P/E implies a 20 year CAGR of 25%. This is Buffett level growth, post-insurance float. Keep in mind that most analysts are only projecting about 10 years into the future, which implies a 58% CAGR. That’s approximately what Starbucks achieved - from date of inception. Not from juggernaut status. Even if it became the global status quo by overtaking Alibaba and global economic growth maintained at historical levels of 2.5%, it would not justify its P/E.

So what is Bezos doing with a $5 billion buyback? Not to be sceptical, but it seems like a confidence-maintaining move. Enron did a buyback in 2001 when shares fell from $100 to $15. There doesn’t need to be fraud for overvaluation to exist.

t3_45f99w,Interesting Stock? GWR.TO,"Occasional lurker, first time posting.

&nbsp;

I stumbled across this security last night, and I am trying to understand it, hoping for insight from others in /r/securityanalysis.

&nbsp;

GWR opened on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2010. The purpose of this corporation is to hold shares in GWRI, a corporation in Delaware, and it acquired a significant stake (48.1%). GWRI operates principally in Phoenix, and is focused on water resource management that owns and operates regulated water, wastewater and recycled water utilities in communities within Phoenix.

&nbsp;

GWR very recently filed paperwork with the SEC to be co-listed on the NASDAQ, which, to my understanding, usually leads to a large jump in liquidity and price.

&nbsp;

As to the financials, and here is the part that I'm trying to understand, they've gone from mediocre performance to pushing out a TTM FCF yield of nearly 20% (edit: much higher, as FCF is reported in USD), and prior to this initiated a very healthy dividend (not withstanding their special dividend). They don't appear to do anything other than hold their shares, so my question is: where did this jump in cashflow come from?

t3_47qjil,Help me take a look at HTS,"New to investing and doing my first read through of The Intelligent Investor. I got to HTS through graham stock screener online and decided to look into it more myself. 



HTS is an REIT that does a significant majority of its business in government agency backed mortgage backed securities. The rest of its operational business is mortgage servicing rights, non agency backed MBS, and morgage lending. 

The balance sheet shows these assets (in thousands): 

* Mortgage Backed Securities - 14,302,230
* Agency CRT Securities - 109,387
* Cash and equivalents - 816,715
* Accrued Interest Receivable - 45,008
* Principal Payments Receivable - 108,201

These assets total ~$15.38B  with total liabilities of ~$14B. I get a net value of these specific assets at $14.37 per outstanding share. The stock is currently selling at $13.93. Looking at total assets instead of just the selected ones above values the stock at ~$22.00


**Dividends**

The company was only established in 2007 but has consistently paid out very high dividends, currently 13.84%. I'm not really sure what to make of this. The yield is obviously very attractive but the fact that they pay out more dividends than they earn in a year is concerning to me. Especially when considering the leveraged nature of this kind of business as they have a total liability to equity ratio around 6.5. How do you guys feel about this?

**Earnings**

I almost didnt look further into this stock after I saw that it was trading at 44 times earnings. The past 3 years have shown poor earnings, but if you average the last 8 years of earnings and compare that to current price we get a PE ratio of 10.17. I'm aware that 8 years is the entire life of the company, and that in these past 8 years MBS has been a hot topic issue. Either way, that averaged P/E ratio warrants a closer look. 

This is where it starts to go over my head. REIT's are classically reactive to changes in interest rates. They have losses in the past 3 years from derivative instruments which they use as a hedge against rising interest, and these losses seem to grow year after year which has made their current PE ratio unattractively high. 

However, consider the fact that Libor 12 month rate is up from around ~0.8 in oct/nov 2015 to ~1.15 today, and consider the fact that the Fed is expected to raise interest rates more than once this year, probably starting in march. These losses from derivative instruments should shrink away, and potentially even turn them into profits as interest rates go up. If not for these derivative losses the shares would be priced at about 5-6 times earnings. 

   Also consider the fact that 78% of the mortgage backed securities owned by the company are guaranteed by government agencies like GNMA or Freddie Mac. So while rising interest rates will probably decrease the book value of these assets, the revenue they produce is guaranteed. Higher interest rates also means opportunity to acquire higher yielding mbs in the future.

**Conclusion**

There are too many suppositions above for me to make a solid conclusion. It seems like a good opportunity to me based on its net assets per share alone. However, the dividend payments seem unsustainable and the currently low earnings are concerning. I've rationalized an expected increase in earnings, but I admit my knowledge of derivatives and swaps is extremely limited.

t3_48uocj,What prohibits a hedge fund manager from enriching himself by acquiring a controlling stake in a company with his investors' money and paying himself out a salary from the company in question?,"I'm asking because I stumbled upon a bit of a special but interesting situation (OTC ticker: SDOI) and I'm genuinely wondering what can go wrong here and how I might be getting screwed as a minority shareholder.

So let me describe this situation briefly.

SDOI is a little shell company with ~23 M in cash and ~21M shares outstanding. It has NOLs of around 18M. The (illiquid) shares are currently trading at around $0,90, which represents a discount of almost 20% to NAV.

Now what makes this situation (even more) interesting is that 2 days ago, Standard General L.P. bought out a previously big shareholder (B. Riley & Co) by acquiring about 3.5M shares from them for ~ $1.18 a share. That represents a premium of 30% from where the stock is trading now. After this transaction Standard General L.P. now has 7.3M shares or about a 35% interest in the company.

So clearly, Standard General L.P. sees some value here (and so do I). At $0.90 these shares seem like a very good deal to me. So I guess I'm trying to figure out what the worst possible case scenario might be.

Frankly, the discount that's present here almost seems like it's to good to be true, which is making me very paranoid.

Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.

I noticed they have a negative shareholders' equity for 2014 (725), aswell as in 2013 (82). 

Relevant news to the shareholders' equity is that on 16 December 2014, IHG agrees to acquire Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants for $430 million in cash (According to news releases). In the Annual report it is reported that Net cash flow arising on acquisition is $438 million. (page 112). 

So to my understanding, since Shareholders Equity = Total assets - Total Liabilities. 
3,769 - 3,450 = 319 (For 2015)
2,818 - 3,535 = -717 (For 2014)

Since acquisition of Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants for $430 million was completed in 2015, I figure that the cash outflow starting from 2014 and the gain in the complete intangible asset of Kimpton in 2015 explain the change from negative to position shareholder equity within this time period. 

Assuming my understanding is correct, why is the ROE for 2014 & 2015 shown as N/A , while 2013 ROE value being shown despite it having a negative Shareholders equity ( of -$82m)?

t3_4ab0jn,First stab at a valuation: Activision Blizzard Inc. Comments and criticism welcomed!,"**Investment Thesis**

I am recommending a Buy position for Activision Blizzard Inc. Based on multiple valuation methods, the average fair market value of ATVI is $41.33. Activision is the largest video game firm in the world. It currently controls the entire video game realm with famous franchises including Call of Duty, Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, and the recently acquired Candy Crush. ATVI also owns Major League Gaming, a professional esports organization that hosts major video game tournaments worldwide. I believe they are positioned for a large growth as they enter a new genre of gaming with their Overwatch, first person shooter game. They are also expected to release a movie in 2016 made after the hit franchise Warcraft. And as Virtual Reality systems such as Occulus develop, so too will ATVI build games for that arena.

**EIC Analysis**

**Economy**

The markets have been very volatile at the beginning of 2016 giving ATVI a YTD return of nearly -18% while the S&P 500 only suffered -5%. The economy for video games is still very strong and worldwide. Four out of five households owned a video game console in 2014 and the U.S Computer and Video game sales have been increasing, even through the financial crisis.[1] Over the last five years, ATVI has had a total return of 200%, outperforming the S&P 500 by near 4x.

**Industry**

The video game industry is in a mature state characterized by cyclical growth and strong competition. The industry relies on constant new releases of popular video games to attract consumer sentiment and fuel demand. Over the last decade we’ve seen a large shift over to “social games” being played on devices that connect to the internet. Sales are largely generated through new channels that incorporate downloadable content, in-game purchases, advertisement revenue, and subscription fees. Esports has also risen to play a major role in gaming industry. MLG hosts professional competitions in CounterStrike: GO, Call of Duty, DOTA 2, Starcraft, and Halo. The amount of live viewers for esports events overall have been increasing over the year as we see more and more international competitive play amongst new games. Last year, the largest esports event reached 36 million in 2015.[2]

**Company**

Activision is primarily driven by the sale of its video games. They have large market shares in all types of gaming systems including mobile, console, and PC. They recently acquired King Digital, producer of Candy Crush, the top downloaded game in the iOS store in 2015[3] and ranked #6 in the highest grossing app.[4] They are also known for World of Warcraft, the largest Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game in the world which hit a subscriber base of 12.5 million players in 2012[5], and are currently reaping a base subscription fee of $15 per player per month. Last year, ATVI generated around $4.6B in revenue while King generated around $2B. Together in 2016, they are expected to generate around $6.5B.

**DCF/NPV Valuation**

A DCF model was created to estimate ATVI’s net present value . The following assumptions were made: a 6% projected growth for 2016 from the completion of the King Digital acquisition, revenues from mobile would grow from last year as the smart phone industry grew, and a conservative yet consistent year-on-year growth between 1-2% for the next 10 years with a terminal growth rate of 2%.

http://i.imgur.com/gWPUcvy.png

http://i.imgur.com/F8EV8z5.png

http://i.imgur.com/FRFlflg.png

ATVI historically has no debt. They recently took on debt for the purchase of King Digital and has been paying it down annually. I project this debt will be completely paid off in the future and accounted for that in our assumptions. Their NPV and Share price is highly affected by the discount rate and growth rate. As they move away from debt and towards full equity, their value increases.

http://i.imgur.com/ET5nK59.png

http://i.imgur.com/jQMU5K0.png

WACC Calculation: http://imgur.com/ZngMxuo

**APV Valuation**

An APV model was also created to account for their change in capital structure. ATVI went from historically no debt, to taking on close to $5B in debt on their balance sheet after acquiring King Digital. Their long-term debt has decreased this year. I'm inferring that ATVI does not tend to take on debt and will pay this off. Therefore, an APV valuation would reflect a closer accurate towards the company’s intrinsic value. The APV value for the firm came out to $33.10 per share. The below picture shows the APV projected cash flow and tax shields. This is under the assumption that ATVI does not take on anymore debt or acquisitions and continues to gradually pay off their current debt.

http://i.imgur.com/Ils2Hw1.png

http://i.imgur.com/BjDWAKO.png

**PE EPS Multiple Valuation**

The last method of valuating ATVI was to project the EPS growth over the next 10 years and multiple the terminal EPS by the forward P/E ratio. Their Price-to-Earnings ratio is currently 25.63. Their expected EPS in year 2025E is 1.65. This is using a conservative approach assuming their outstanding shares remain constant. Using the projected DCF model as a base, the estimated fair value based on the PE EPS multiple was $42.27.

http://i.imgur.com/dyZ61KK.png

**Technical Analysis**

Based on technical analysis, the stock has dropped almost 20% from its 52-week highs. On the monthly chart, we can see a very strong convicting bounce off the 20-day moving average. The moving averages are ordered in a bullish manner and the most recent red candlestick shows very strong buy volume from its long tail.

http://i.imgur.com/XW30axX.png


**Conclusion**

Activision is expected to have a huge boost in earnings this year due to the King Acquisition. I expect growth to subside the following year but remain stable as mobile games grow slowly with console and PC. Outside of mobile, I project 7% growth in PC revenues and 9% growth in console games over the year. Operating margins have increased slowly since 2014 and will expect to grow on average 1% a year. The recommend fair value price is based off three different valuations that all result in a higher expected share price. I expect ATVI’s share price to increase by 20% over the next 10 years in a neutral to bullish economy.

t3_4bhvi2,Let's discuss Chevron [CVX] in the greater context of the energy sector.,"Let's talk about the energy sector. It looks like oil has rebounded from it's near $20 low, back to the $38-$40 range. While still low, this allows a lot of the energy sector to minimize losses. US reserves have gone down for the first time in months perhaps signaling a shift that we've hit the bottom and are on the way up.

Chevron out all of the energy majors has some of the lowest debt to equity ratings. This means that even if these prices persist and debt obligations bankrupt a lot of the smaller players Chevron should be in the clear. It may even be able to acquire smaller rivals who go bankrupt for cheap. On top of that Chevron has a lot of its revenue coming from refinement, of which the major capital cost is the cost of oil. With oil prices depressed, it actually boost profit  generation from its refinement arm.

 It has a dividend yield of 4.44% which gives reasonable returns even in the absence of oil rebounding within the next year. However if oil does return to $80 a barrel it stands to profit handsomely.

However just today Chevron was downgraded by Raymond James from Outperform to market perform.

With all of these positives going for it, why the downgrade? What am I missing here?

EDIT: Would just like to add that I've completely changed my stance on oil. Sold all my CVX yesterday (good thing too, todays drops are pretty steep). I was listening to Art Berman talk about the future of oil in this podcast and one thing that stuck with me was his insistence on oil not being able to rally until our reserves dropped to < 80%.

t3_4boj7w,ROIC<WACC Value Destruction Conundrum,"Hey guys, my mind is currently wrapped around this basic idea that when the ROIC of a firm is lower than its WACC, it destroys value. Of course this is true if you assume unlimited funds to invest. I use the following example to explain this principle and why it does not hold under capital constraints on investment. I implemented the S&P 500's historical return of almost 10% for the WACC as I am not a fan of beta and use profit instead of NOPLAT for simplicity's sake. In this example the invested capital is the only cost of business - i.e. I spend all cash on sugar, lemons, and water, then sell all of it as lemonade, re-up and do it again.

Ex: Lemonade Stand. I have $1 and can either invest it in this business which has an annual ROIC of 9%, or invest it in the S&P500 and get 10%.

Lemonade Stand in Year 1:

Invested Capital (lemons, sugar, water): $100,
Revenue: $109,
Profit: $9,
ROIC=9/100=9%

S&P 500 in Year 1:

Invested Capital: $100,
""Revenue"": $110,
""Profit"": $10,
ROIC: 10/100=10%

So in year 1, by investing in the lemonade stand instead of the S&P 500 I have destroyed $1 of value. Very straightforward but here is where I get lost. As growth increases, the business with ROIC below WACC is supposed to increasingly destroy value but I take issue with this as it assumes that the investors have unlimited funds to generate these returns on. Let's say that my entire net worth is $100 before Year 1, so I cannot invest further in the S&P 500 even if I wanted to. 

Let's say that in Year 2, growth increases in the lemonade stand to such a level that I turn over inventory twice in the year.

Start of Year 2:

Lemonade Stand
IC1- $109,
Revenue1- $118.81,
Profit1- $9.81,
ROIC=9.81/109=9%,
IC2- $118.81,
Revenue2- $129.5,
Profit2- $10.69,
ROIC for second turn-$10.69/118.81=9%,
Profit for year: $20.5


S&P 500:

IC- $110,
""Revenue""- $121,
""Profit""- $11,
ROIC- 11/110=10%

So here is the issue. I only had $100 to start, so I couldn't invest anything more in the S&P 500 in Year 2. On the other hand, I retained all earnings from the lemonade business, increasing the effective invested capital and increasing profits despite ROIC remaining constant. This led to increased value generation on the year. Despite the opportunity cost (WACC) being higher than the ROIC of the business, value was increased through growth.

Please let me know if I am missing something, but under capital constraints, the assumption that if a firm's ROIC<WACC then value is destroyed with increased growth can be false. Of course if I had the same invested capital for both investments then the lemonade business would have destroyed more value in year 2 than in year 1 through its growth. In a public firm this value destruction rule would nearly always apply, but to a small investor who has the option of starting a business or any investor with limited funds it can be very false.

Looking forward to responses.

Baker Street Capital thought it was quite high compared to the stock price of around $40 but in 2015 they sold 300 stores for about $2.7bn- not good as it suggests a much lower RE value then they estimated. The rampant purchases by Lampert and others spike curiosity.. It seems they will be going bankrupt within the next few years so it may not be long before we find out, unless of course they can generate cash with the assets they still have. I find it highly interesting especially due to the fact that nobody can agree on this question. I am personally staying away due to my lack of understanding but am curious of everyone's thoughts.

To throw my opinion out there, I believe Berkowitz and Lampert especially are in over their heads and it seems the break up value may be less than expected... We shall see",12,0.88,1458929978,"[['RE', 1]]",RE,190.1699981689453,199.4499969482422

**Quick Summary (Long Thesis)**

Vasco Data Security International develops anti fraud and authentication solutions for access to its client's data. Their primary products is DigiPass - a complete security product for central or mobile data. Vasco's primary market is the banking industry, where they are the leader in providing security software solutions.

The software security industry offers excellent opportunities for sustained competitive advantage via moats. Customers needs are often specific and niche, providing the opportunity for custom solutions. These solutions, once implemented, will face high switching costs to an alternative. The risk of switching a security solution is just too high, especially for businesses in the financial industry.

Price competition is fierce, as the market is fragmented with numerous firms offering bids with their technologies. Security certifications and customer relationships offer a barrier to entry for new competitors. High margins and steady ROIC show that Vasco has been able to withstand competition over the last 10 years.

For the last 5 years, revenue forecasts have never missed by more than 10% and have been cautious. Operating margins have held above 10% and have increased over the last few years which shows management's commitment to good capital allocation. Vasco holds no long term or short term debt. It's growth is purely through its cash flows. Their highest operating expense is their headcount, which has been adjusted by management based on the economic climate. In 2016, management will be increasing headcount for fuel their growth divisions.

Using a DCF from free cash flows, with the historic ROIC of 15% and reinvestment of 30%, WACC of 10%, the intrinsic value of VDSI sits around $30. **Steady ROIC and improving margins, steady R&D, increasing cash flows, along with zero debt and the valuation make VDSI an attractive investment.** Furthermore, the current P/E of 14 sits near a 5 year historical low of 10. 

Overall I am confident about their financial strength and margins. I'm not as certain about the strength in their technology and their growth prospects; I believe this is offset by the increase in demand for digital security and the moat offered by the financial sector. What are your opinions? Would appreciate a critique on my thesis and analysis. This is my first shot at a DD writeup and am looking to improve.

t3_4cgmq5,Discussion of Net Net: Emerson Radio (MSN),"DISCLOSURE: I own a small stake in MSN. I am trying to decide whether it should become an normal sized position in my portfolio or if I should dump it.

After reading Deep Value by Tobias Carlisle I decided to see if there are any net nets currently available. I used the following Finviz Screener Criteria: Country: USA, Price/Cash:  Under 1, Debt/Equity Low (<.1). There are a lot of financial and biotechnology stocks that are not really net nets but show up. Emerson Radio is the stock I was most comfortable declaring a conservative liquidation value because the company's cash and short term investments are much higher than the liabilities.  
In Thousands
Cash and Cash Equivalents: $27612
Short Term Investments (CD that paid out in 1/16): $20114
Total: $47726

Total Liabilities: $3217
Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference: $3677
Total:6894

Net Cash Value:$47726-$6894= 40832
Diluted Shares outstanding=27130
Net Cash per Share: 40832/27130=1.50504976
Current Share Price: .90
Market Price  to Liquidation Value ratio: (.9/1.50504976)*100=59.79869%

If I assume the assets of MSN are worth absolutely nothing the company trades below Ben Graham's rule  of 66% to liquidation value. When I realized this I bought some shares. 

Then I did more research and what I would like to discuss in the thread is how to take the analysis to the next level and determine whether the cash level will stay around this level and whether there will be a catalyst for a change. The historical burn rate is not relevant because Emerson Radio just lost one of its major customers (Target or Walmart) that accounted for a lot of its revenue and lost its licensing deal which also accounted for significant sales. 

For a catalyst, the company's majority share holder (about 56%)is a subsidiary of Grande Holdings, a Chinese firm in the middle of restructuring. They seem to not care about the company as revenues have decreased significantly, will continue to decrease due to loss of customer and licensing deal, but expenses have some how increased. 

In conclusion, I was so excited to find a net net with such a conservative liquidation value, but looking through the proxy statement and the most recent 10-q made me think this was a bad decision because the company looks like it will burn cash very quickly and the majority shareholder seems to have abandoned the company. From reading Deep Value I know that net nets are supposed to be really bad dying companies. Is Emerson Radio a normal net net that looks horrible but will realize this liquidation value? I guess the crux of my question is how do I learn to do a deeper analysis to determine the probability that liquidation value will be realized in this case and other net net situations.

Thank you.

t3_4gvla7,Financial Modeling: Capital structure of a wholly owned subsidiary,"I am working on a project where I am proposing that Dycom Industries (DY) purchases a private company (let's call them ""target"") and I am not sure how to model the acquired company's capital structure. As a wholly owned subsidiary, would the private company's capital structure take on the characteristics of DY (i.e., the private company's D/E ratio = parent) or should I assume the private company's capital structure is independent of the parent company's? 

**My Thoughts So Far**
I have already made the assumption in calculating the discount rate for ""target"" that the capital structure (D/E) is going to be similar to that of the purchaser. It is important to note that DY is a holding company - the sum of roughly 30 subsidiaries. I have read in Damodaran's lesson about valuing private company's that is is reasonable to estimate a private company's cost of capital assuming that the capital structure is going to be similar to that of the acquirer. However, this may differ in reality. Is this true? Would the capital structure of individual subsidiary differ from that of the parent company, since they are essentially their own entity under an umbrella? Would the capital structure of the purchaser change to reflect any use of debt or equity used to make the purchase? ",10,0.91,1461870924,"[['DY', 2]]",DY,69.54000091552734,68.04000091552734
t3_4gus7t,Investment Thesis: SAFM,"Hi everyone,

I bought this stock back in November 2015 when it was at around 69$. I am usually pretty nervous about putting myself out there (who isn't?) and I did do my best due intelligence when I bought it. So i wanted to put it out there and hope that maybe I can learn more about myself or what someone else has to offer. I'm not sure how to write this up so I'll just write up my thought process and some rough calculations for how I arrived at buying in at 68$

SAFM stock price seemed to be beat up due to a combination of factors such as the Avian Flu infecting some chickens in America, export bans, and fears of chicken prices being corrected due to selling at a high price for such a long time. 

Well I decided to see how badly Avian Flu influenced SAFM. Turns out that the bird flu only struck in the Northwest and no cases have been found in the Southeast where SAFM operates. Additionally, the broiler chickens (the chickens raised to be eaten) have never contracted it and were not susceptible to the strain of flu going around. Well I thought the chances of the bird flu not happening are not exactly 0% so there's still a possibility. after all the virus can mutate right? 

The export ban didn't really affect their sales because it accounted for less than 10% of sales and eventually, the ban should be lifted right? Again, it's not 100% sure so maybe we can put it at 50/50.

As for the Chicken price. This I didn't know how to really assign a probability too. Well what if there was a contraction in price? I know that management bought feed and grains at a low cost so that would offset some of the margin they lost on chicken pricing.
Additionally, even if there was a prolonged case lower priced Chicken, I believe SAFM has a good chance of surviving due to their low amount of debt owed (10M$) putting debt-to equity at .01.

What really attracted me to SAFM were a few things. 1) People aren't going to stop eating chicken anytime soon. Again, there maybe a study of how eating chicken causes cancer (I'm just making things up) and the consumption will go down but SAFM's management is good at lower capacity through their plants to offest this and moving to higher margin markets for chicken. At any rate, even with new studies that will show chicken meat in a bad light won't end the chicken industry just like how people still eat red meat. 

2) The management team. This one especially. On top of most employees being enrolled in the stock program and the management having ownership of the company, management has good incentives to try and enhance shareholder value. They have been very disciplined in terms of how they spend their capital. I read through a bunch of the conference calls. Some things I gleaned from itnare that management is moving their operations to the big bird deboning market because of the profitability. Another show of discipline is in their calculations during questions asked in the earning calls for whether to buy back stock, spend on CAPEX, pay down debt, or increase the dividends. They said that building a plant to increase capacity would be equivalent to buying stock at around 38$ which is why they chose to increase CAPEX and not stock buybacks. Additionally, they have a leadership training program where they are training the future leaders of the company in the culture of the company and it's philosophy.

The company's  average ROE is 11% over the past 5 years (including their -25% ROE in 2011). SAFM's situation reminded me of Bruce Greenwald's example of how a company dominating a region will have higher ROE and is in general a better investment. 

The company paid down its debt from 2011 to 2015 going from .54 Debt to equity to just .01 and in 2013 when the debt to equity was at .04 they started ramping up their CAPEX again.

So now for the intrinsic value. I used the DCF on gurufocus.com
I used EPS of around 9.59$ and tried 3 different cases. For all three cases, I assumed growth would happen within 3 years then for the next 10 years they grow at around 3% (to match inflation) I used a discount rate of 10% as my hurdle rate because this is nothing particularly risky about this investment (no complicated financials or business model or high amounts of leverage).

-5% growth for 3 years: in the past 5 years they have posted negative earnings once. So that's 20% probablity if we are looking at a 5 year period. So I have to consider this is likely to happen. Let's say it happened the Intrinsic value would be around 64$. Fine I'll lose money but not much if I buy around 68$.

0% growth for 3 years: this would put it at the intrinsic value at around 75$. So I thought ok if I bought this at around 68-69 yes I could lose money but not much. Plus if this were the case, management to could several things. They could increase dividends, possibly buy back stock, or build more plants. So even though this may happen I wouldn't put it as very likely.

9% growth for 3 years: 9% CAGR is based off of their sales CAGR between 2015 and 2011. So the intrinsic value comes out to around 94$. 38% margin of safety.

So in summary, I saw very little downside based on my estimation for company that was beat down for no reason with a solid management team who is disciplined and knows how to spend their money. Which is similar to the management I saw in ""The Outsiders"" and companies Phil Fisher spoke of. Obviously, just because the price grew, I still need to understand whether it is luck or skill and how I can better enchance my process

Any criticism is appreciated!

t3_4h9u4d,MTBC writeup (long),"MTBC writeup (4/29/2016) - Happy to answer any questions

**Overview**

Medical Transcription Billing Corp. (“MTBC” or the “Company”) is a healthcare IT company that serves small to medium ambulatory healthcare practices (i.e. non-hospital, outpatient facilities with 1-10 providers), which account for more than 2/3 of the 500k+ ambulatory practices in the US. MTBC primarily provides revenue cycle management (“RCM”) services, but also offers electronic health records (“EHRs”), practice management, and clearinghouse and centralized electronic data interchange. As of 2015, the Company served 730 practices representing 1.5k providers across 60 specialties and in 44 states.

MTBC is a recurring revenue business with 95% revenue visibility at the beginning of each quarter and 1-3 year contracts with automatic renewals. Customer renewal rates were 79% in 2015, including 99% for customers who are also EHR users, which account for 45% of revenue. The Company is projected to generate revenue and EBITDA of $28.5mn and $1.8mn (6.1% margin), respectively, in 2016 at the midpoint of management’s guidance.

**Valuation**

I’m long MTBC common equity and believe the Company is undervalued at 11x 2016B EBITDA (9x excluding full credit for the federal NOLs, which don’t begin to expire for another 18 years), or 0.7x 2016B revenue. With an enterprise value of only $20mn, MTBC is a small and underfollowed company with low float and low institutional ownership. The Company had a busted IPO in mid-2014, pricing 50% below its intended range, and has seen its share price since decrease by 80%. I think further downside is limited at current levels and the business is at an inflection point in its growth trajectory.

The Company has continued to be punished by investors despite significant operational improvements. Since the IPO in mid-2014, the Company expanded EBITDA margin by 6.5% in 2015 and is projected to expand by 9.1% in 2016B (15.6% total margin expansion from 2014-2016B), has almost fully integrated the three sizable acquisitions made in connection with the IPO, and had its first quarter of positive EBITDA since IPO in Q4 2015.

In my base case (i.e. excluding sizable M&A), I value MTBC at $1.97 per share ($2.20 including full credit for the federal NOLs) based on 10.0x 2017E EBITDA of $3.4mn, which implies 97% upside to current levels (120% including full credit for the federal NOLs), or 2:1 upside by the end of 2017.

Catalysts include (i) financial performance improvement and return to pre-IPO margins, (ii) continued rollup of smaller RCM companies, (iii) acquisition of a larger RCM company in the $10-50mn revenue area, and (iv) increased investor awareness.

**Inflection point in growth trajectory**

Weak financial performance in the last two years (i.e. negative EBITDA in 2014 and 2015) is not an accurate reflection of MTBC’s run rate growth and margin profiles. This underperformance has been largely driven by one-time events in connection with management’s positioning of the Company for future growth.

In connection with its IPO in mid-2014, MTBC made three acquisitions (Omni, Practicare, and CastleRock). This was a transformative time for the Company, with revenue and provider base doubling. EBITDA margin turned negative for the first time in the last five years. Prior to the IPO and three acquisitions, MTBC’s core business (pre-acquisitions) had 7-12% margins from 2009-2012 and 11% in 2013.

Note that the Company is often acquiring struggling and unprofitable businesses that take time to integrate and turnaround, so there is an immediate negative profitability impact (there are also duplicative employees initially). Two of the three companies acquired at IPO were unprofitable. Integration of these three companies has also taken longer than expected, as the three acquisitions comprised essentially nine independently run divisions. As such, management was forced to revise 2015 guidance down twice, which punished the share price.

Management made significant improvements in 2015, with EBITDA margin expanding by 6.5%. In Q3 2015, MTBC raised $5mn of preferred stock to fund growth (note that management spent the entire Q3 getting this deal done, which took longer than expected).

The Company is now at an inflection point in its growth trajectory. With integration of the three companies acquired at IPO largely complete, $8mn in cash on hand, and a shelf registration for $20mn of additional preferred and common stock, MTBC is well-positioned for growth. Indeed, Q4 2015 was the first quarter of positive EBITDA since the Company’s IPO.

MTBC is now planning to focus more on organic growth. Historically, management has focused on initially improving profitability at the expense of revenue retention for acquired customers. This has led to trouble retaining customers post-acquisition. For example, in 2015, the Company only retained 48% of acquired customers from the three acquisitions at the time of IPO 17 months following closing. Customers of the acquired businesses from 2012-2014 (excluding CastleRock) generated a $5.3mn of revenue per quarter at the time of acquisition, which decreased by an average 23% one year post-acquisition. As these acquisitions are largely integrated now, management believes its customer base has stabilized. Management is now focused on customer retention in addition to improving profitability. Regarding the first acquisition of 2016 (Gulf Coast Billing; $3mn in revenue), management noted it “will be the first acquisition where our goal is to increase the revenue” and “[w]e expect to see that revenue at least stay flat if not grow.”

Also, having historically underinvested in sales and marketing (<2% of revenue), the Company hired additional sales and marketing staff in December 2015 and doubled sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue in Q4 2015. I expect this to drive incremental sales going forward.

**Management team aligned with shareholders**

Management and directors collectively own >50% of the Company’s common equity and 1.5% of the preferred equity. The founder / CEO himself owns 47% and 1%, respectively. The Company has been cognizant of shareholder dilution, choosing to issue preferred stock to fund growth since the IPO. The Company also has a $1mn share repurchase program. Management has indicated a preference to not issue new common equity until the Company’s valuation increases (>1x revenue), unless a sizable acquisition opportunities presents itself.

**M&A platform**

MTBC is a platform for rolling up smaller local and regional RCM companies serving smaller medical practices, having made 14 acquisitions since 2006 and entering revenue share agreements with four companies to manage their operations. The RCM space is fragmented with 1.5k+ companies and no single company with double digit market share. Given the ever changing, increasingly complex healthcare environment, it is difficult for many of these smaller companies to adequately serve their customers without significant investment in IT and human capital.

“We are in daily conversations with potential acquisition targets as we continue to work at identifying the very best opportunities to put our growth capital to work. The companies we are talking with, from the very smallest to the largest, are all struggling to hold their ground as the market evolves since they lack the technology and the business models needed to remain competitive…[W]e believe with the IPO market the way it is, with 6 IPOs so far, in one of the slowest and toughest IPO markets, some of these players who were thinking of going public as an exit strategy are finding it hard do so. And so we are talking to a couple of them in the $10 million to $50 million range.” – Management

The Company aims to acquire RCM companies, migrate acquired customers onto its software platform, and improve profitability. MTBC’s ability to lower operating costs post-acquisition largely stems from outsourcing operations (e.g. handling chart capture, payment posting, and follow up) to its call center in Pakistan (1.5k college-educated employees). Management believes its Pakistan-based team costs half of comparable India-based employees and 1/10th of comparable US-based employees.

The Company typically aims to buy companies in the $5-10mn range, it also enters revenue sharing arrangements for smaller RCM companies (under $3mn in revenue) rather than complete actual acquisitions. In these situations, MTBC takes over providing services to customers and pays the RCM company a percentage of the revenue it collects. These agreements have minimal upfront cost and allow MTBC to ultimately pay <1x revenue.

**Value proposition**

Managing the reimbursement process and day-to-day operations is becoming increasingly complex, costly, and time-consuming for small and medium healthcare practices. MTBC’s value proposition is simple: Reduce administrative burdens and ensure proper cash collection while improving clinical outcomes. Benefits to customers include accurate reimbursement, reduced claim denial rates, improved A/R days, and reduced patient no-shows. MTBC’s solutions provide real-time data needed for important decisions, such as insurance eligibility, provider productivity details, and payor benchmarking. Importantly, the larger players in the space (e.g. athenahealth) are not highly focused on practices with 1-10 providers, so there are not many players of scale here.

The Company is a low cost provider with its standard platform fee at 2.5-5% of a practice’s healthcare-related revenue (minimum $1k per provider per month). Thus, MTBC’s incentives are aligned with its customers, as it only gets paid if its customers get paid. Importantly, the Company’s solutions are effective. MTBC’s first-time acceptance rate (i.e. percentage of claims submitted electronically by MTBC to insurers and clearinghouses that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding) was 95% in 2015 vs. an industry average of 94%. MTBC customers’ median days in A/R (i.e. median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by the Company on behalf of a customer and the date the claim is paid to the customer) was 35 days for primary care and 39 days for combined specialties in 2015 vs. an industry average of 38.

**Risks**

Customer retention: The Company has historically had trouble retaining acquired customers, as previously noted above.

Small company: The Company could execute well operationally, but the investor base is currently limited give MTBC’s size, so catalysts may not have their intended effects on the market valuation.

Access to the capital markets: The Company will need to issue additional preferred stock, common stock, and/or debt to fund growth, and in particular, larger M&A transactions.

Compliance: MTBC disclosed a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in its last 10k. The Company also has several related-party agreements with its founder / CEO, which have significant contractual obligations and were not reviewed by the audit committee prior to enactment. I think both of these risks are understandable given the Company’s small size and involvement of the founder / CEO, and MTBC has taken steps to improve controls. However, this is a healthcare company that outsources work to Pakistan, so potential for HIPAA or other violations is elevated.

Debt compliance: At the end of 2014, the Company was not in compliance with its debt service coverage covenant required under its revolver, which was waived by TD Bank, its longtime lender of many years. This facility was later refinanced with Opus Bank, which has three financial covenants: (i) Maximum Senior Leverage Ratio: 2.25x for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and each quarter thereafter; (ii) Minimum Asset Coverage Ratio: 1.30x at the end of each month; and (iii) Minimum EBITDA: $1.05mn for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.",13,0.88,1462120108,"[['MTBC', 14], ['RCM', 7], ['TD', 1]]",MTBC,0.9800000190734863,1.0

Long-story short you can take a screen and see how it's performed over the last X years vs. the S&P 500. 

I've been working on http://simfina.com for a little while now and I'd love some feedback.

The site functions like a normal screener, you can add filters and tweak them to construct a strategy or idea (TTM P/E less than 15, EBITDA margin over 25%, etc) and see the stocks that currently fit that screen.  Where we try to diversify ourselves from a traditional screener is by giving users the power to see how that screen has performed over the last X years vs. the S&P 500 (more benchmarks to come).  

We're in early alpha so I'm sure there's a ton of bugs, if you guys could help me kink out the errors that'd be awesome!  We don't ask for an email or any personal info, just looking for some feedback on the general idea.  It's half-baked at the moment but if this is something you guys think could add value to your investing routine I'd love to know.

Add the two together, we get a new BV of about **2.0b**.

t3_4iql5c,Investment Thesis: TKOI,"Hey everyone,

So here is another one of my ideas for an investment. This one will probably be looked at as more controversial since it is OTC AND a penny stock. I do have a position in it as of almost a year.

For some background, I first came across Telkonet two years ago.  To put it simply, what they do is sell an array of items, such as automated thermostats to save you energy on your heating/cooling bill. Telkonet also sells HSIA (High speed internet) but they have started to phase away from that due to market saturation into the energy savings industry (hotels, schools, hospital) which is high margin (they recently made 55% GM in Q1 2016).

While working at my current job, I found Telkonet after offering to help my boss install some of their thermostat units in a hotel. The thermostats are all connected and synced up to a central unit  where the hotel manager can monitor the energy output of each room. So I'll give some characteristics of this company that I think will make it a good investment

PROS:

High cost of switching: Installing these units is a pain. But uninstalling these units is even more work. So once these units are set up, it will be a long time before a competitor will come and move in on the target so there is a ""stickiness"" there

Economy of Scales: The bigger the project, the cheaper it is for the hotel/school/etc. to save money. The cost to install the units depends on the amount of rooms but the cost of the software (telkonet also is a SaaS company) to monitor the energy output in each room goes down the more rooms there are. That's because the SaaS has a fixed cost and is spread out as the number of rooms increase

Incentives and Proprietary Knowledge: Never forget Charlie Munger said if you should be thinking about anything, its incentives. One thing I learned while installing these units is the amount of money the owner of the property gets from energy savings. This is due to  proprietary  knowledge. Telkonet has patents on their energy saving technologies which makes their products more responsive and quicker to react than other units. I know this due to my boss' knowledge in the industry and also from personal experiences at Hotels when Honeywell's thermostats (Enconn) units really failed to accommodate my temperature settings and didn't adapt very well or quickly. At any rate, due to the patents the managers is able to get a bigger rebate check then just using a Honeywell Encon unit, or Pelican.

Regional Dominance (?): From personal experience, I see salesmen at my office quoting more Telkonet and even customers asking for telkonet on jobs that require a HVAC system. On their most recent quarterly call, their east coast business has increased and I believe that if they can dominate the east coast they will begin to have a healthy ROIC.

Additional comments: I can't speak much for management but I do know that in the past 2 years they have all been buying stocks directly which reassures me SOMEWHAT in the success of this company. 

CONS:

They have been losing money for the past 6 years or so. Although in Q1 2016 they finally removed the ""going concern"" for the first time from their quarterly indicating that their auditors believe that they won't have any shortage of funds in the near future. But I want to keep my eye out on this and see how the company progresses.

Telkonet is in a new industry that is estimated to be worth billions of dollars. I can only find a few competitors. The biggest one being Honeywell (Enconn). I can't find any information on the finances of this unit so I don't know what kind of margins or cash flows to expect. But with Honeywell being such a big player and being able to expense so much to R&D, I wonder how long it will take for them to catch up to Telkonet and match the amount of money they offer on rebates. 

Catalysts: Management has talked about doing a reverse split to uplist the company from an OTC stock to a stock on NASDAQ. Reverse splits seem to be seen in a negative light so maybe most investors will ignore the stock or cause its price to become depressed. The other side is that it will become visible to more institutional investors.

There has been a growing knowledge in Telkonet's products and offerings. This has taken quite a while because the company had/has to go out and train several people in how to install the units, get them to speak to the software, etc. But it seems that recently there are more and more people becoming well versed in the telkonet products (again this is anecdotal on my part) so maybe in the near future we will see a ""critical mass"" in knowledge and installation as people become more efficient at installing these units. 

Closing: Again because this company has been losing money almost every quarter, I don't know how to project cash flows or EPS. So really, I can't even assign an intrinsic value. But with it being one of the first movers in this industry, is there a chance they can establish themselves and gain considerable market share and health margins? Or will they be one of the casualties like the first wave of pioneers who go to explore new lands?

I've recently fell in love with value investing, and have been reaching out to various people in finance trying to find out how I can get into the industry. 

However, it was recently made known to me that asset management jobs are usually reserved for people from target schools, such as MIT and Harvard. There were many reasons why I chose UMASS, mostly finances, but I also regret not finding out more before I chose my undergraduate. 

I'd like to plan ahead given what I know now. What kind of Master's program should I look into getting into in 3-5 years time, if I'd like to get a job in AM? 

My question isn't about which school I should aim for, so much as which program would be the most appropriate to land a role in 'value investing'. Should I plan to get an MBA? Or would an MsF from Boston College be more appropriate? I don't really see myself getting into Harvard or MIT, but perhaps an M7 school is possible.

I've also been encouraged to get a CFA, but some people have told me that its seen by employers as lesser than a Master's. Is this true, and to what extent is it true?

Any other suggestions would be most welcome. Thank you in advance for your time.

t3_4mvdhm,"Very New to This, Looking for Critiques on AIRT","Background: So I'm 21 and just graduated with an Accounting degree, working on my Master's now. I have a job lined up for afterwards and a good bit of money saved from an internship. Needless to say I am new to securities investing, but have followed it for a while. I opened an account about 3 months ago and put a lot of my money in blue chips, but decided I wanted more risk in my portfolio. Now I am pretty diversified, with a couple of large caps, some mid cap, and am now looking to value invest.

Running some screeners based off of some of Graham's recommended attributes for undervalued stocks, I came across $AIRT. Their financials look pretty decent for their size, but I don't know quite enough about the industry. AIRT essentially operates business units that repair airport tarmac equipment and move freight for shipping services, mostly FedEx. Their current and quick ratios are strong, but their margins aren't ideal as it seems the industry is going through a sort of squeeze. I am going long on them because they seem to be positioned to survive a consolidation in the industry and their previous year, which was less than impressive, looks to have been more of a one-off caused by restructuring and other discrepancies that should be getting ironed out as the new teams settle in. With that being said, their numbers are pretty solid. Highlights:

                    AirT vs Industry

Price/Earnings: 11.6 vs 22

Price/Book: 1.7 vs 6

Price/Sales: 0.4 vs 1.1	

Revenue Growth (3 yr): 7.9 vs 5.7

Net Income Growth (3 yr): 22.5 vs 24

Net Margin %: 3.7 vs 5.1	 		

ROA: 11.2	vs 7.8	 		

ROE: 15.5 vs 27.6	 		

This may not be relevant ever but they also authorized stock buyback of up to 750,000 shares (31.25% of outstanding shares).

t3_4pk4tt,"Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) arbitrage opportunities. Identify and scrutinise the suspect loans, buy the securities, and pursue remedies via activist bond actions","Back in 2006 to 2008 was the worst credit underwriting period in history for commercial real estate loans, especially retail assets, that were sold into CMBS pools. The same as for the RMBS sector....But there have been virtually no loans repurchased by the originating banks that reaped millions from fraudulent loan sales as with RMBS.
Why? The CMBS trusts have been rigged by the trust parties (servicers and trustees) that are charged with managing the assets/loans. As a result pension funds, insurance funds, and investors are left holding the bag on hundreds of millions in losses from retail assets because the trust parties are systematically violating the terms and spirit of their obligations under the trust documents, the pooling and servicing agreements and the prospectus.
Take the definition of controlling class in a CMBS for example of how they have rigged the trust....in 2003 when the banks pushed the rating agencies to change the definition of controlling class note holder. The definition use to be the junior most note holder with at least 25% of original principle outstanding PLUS appraisal reduction amounts. In 2003, starting with the BACM deals, the definition began to be just realized losses excluding appraisal reduction amounts. This created an arbitrage opportunity for the servicers and their usually-affiliated controlling class note holders. Realized loss timing and quantum can be controlled by the servicers and their 'out of the money' junior notes became the controlling class for multiple billion dollar CMBS pools, while those more senior notes that are 'in the money' with skin in the game lost control.
There was extensive discussion at the rating agencies behind this change and the arbitrage opportunity against the senior note holders was glaringly apparent. Well the rating agencies approved it of course, in a very Enron-esque environment where senior rating agency staff were sleeping with the bankers, etc...you get the picture.
By 2004 the definition of controlling class was across the board excluding appraisal reduction amounts. By 2005 the crazy underwriting was out of control and by 2006 all rational underwriting standards were out the window. The norm became that banks churn and burn and originate as fast as possible to take the profits, sell the loan, and run. I have numerous examples of banks selling loans with retail collateral where there are inflated appraisal values, undisclosed environmental catastrophes, half completed assets under construction being sold as complete and fully occupied, massive 'cash outs' in loan refinancings being sold as acquisitions, inaccurate historical NOI....the list goes on. Anecdotally, have a look at the number of loans originated in 06 to 08 that were extensively renovated just prior to loan sale to justify lower expenses.
The trust parties conveniently hid and ignored the sins of the originators and perpetuated the non discovery of the violations and now hide behind statute of limitations to bar action. They do this because they earn more from working out the loans, flipping the loans to their affiliates at a discount, and then selling the loans to the open market. Or they hold on to the assets for their own real estate operating companies. This is the biggest wealth transfer in history from second tier wealthy individuals and companies to the top tier hedge funds and private equity firms that now run the CMBS trusts.
When senior note holders try and take remedial action they face multiple hurdles. Firstly they must indemnify the trustee for potential losses associated with the proposed remedial action. Secondly the worried note holder cannot identify or communicate with other senior note holders without the trustees' cooperation. The central registrar of note holders is held by the Depository Trust Corporation, a 'non profit' controlled and funded by about 30 of the worlds top banks. Thirdly they face trading restrictions on an already impaired security because servicers deem the information as insider information-this is a scare tactic that has never been tested to my knowledge.

t3_4qhm7b,WNC thesis,"Hi everyone,

Here to pitch another idea. This time its Wabash National Corporation (WNC). This is a little more detailed and long so I'll provide a brief summary of my reasoning first and anyone can feel free to dive into the math and logic further down below.

Briefly, my thesis relies on two factors: 1) Good Management who allocates capital efficiently by knowing when to buy back shares, pay down debt, and acquire companies 2) Managment is disciplined which is shown in their ability to prefer margin over volume in sales transactions and 3) an inconsistency between the reality of the company (it is becoming  a more diverse company) and the way investors are currently view it (a cyclical trailer company) causing it to be mispriced. I calculate intrinsic value for the company under 4 different cases from its current price of 12.44 USD:

EPS growth at -8%: 10.17 USD (-22% Margin of Safety)

EPS growth at 0%: 12.64 USD (2% Margin of Safety)

EPS growth at 5%: 14.38 USD (13% Margin of Safety)

EPS growth at 10%: 16.28 USD (24% Margin of Safety)  

The more detailed explanation is as follows. Pulling from Google Finance:
""Wabash National Corporation is engaged in designing, manufacturing and marketing standard and customized truck and tank trailers, intermodal equipment and transportation related products. ""

The Company has three segments: Commercial Trailer Products (71% of sales as of 2015), Diversified Products (21% of sales as of 2015), and Retail (8% of sales as of 2015). 

CTP manufactures standard and customized van and platform trailers that the trucks haul. The Diversified Product Group sells products that compliment the trailer business such as liquid tank trailers as opposed to the dry bulk trailers we normally see on the highway. Retail segment is simply the locations owned by the company to sell directly to the customer. 

Now to the meat of my thesis.

In the past 5 years WNCs ratios are as follows:

ROE: 10%	15%	14%	16%	24% 

(In 2012 the company has a restructuring charge of 57 million USD giving ROE of 39% so I removed this charge)

Debt to Equity: 44% 155%	111% 83% 63% 

(they made an acquisition in 2012 but have been paying it off since then)

FCF/share: $(0.12)  $(4.46)	 $1.42  $1.12  $1.91 

Current Ratio: 1.6  2.1 2.1	2.6 2.5

In 2012 WNC acquired the Walker company to expand their business into the diversified products line. WNC claims that:

""through these brands and product offerings, our Diversified Products segment now serves a variety of end markets a number of which we believe are less cyclical than other markets historically served by Wabash""

I think that many investors have yet to see this transition from a cyclical company that sells trailers to a more diversified company because they diversified segment still only makes up 25% of sales. But I believe it will take another 2-3 years for the changes to be fully realized. 

This acquisition and diversification leads me to my next point which is Management. I was looking at managements philosophy on acquisitions and how they make capital allocations. In a conference call in we have management say:

“So we have not backed off on our interest in looking at acquisitions that make sense. I’ve said repeatedly in the past that, we will continue to be strategic in our growth initiatives, but selective. And that meaning that, we will look at a lot of opportunities to add to the business, but we’re not going to acquire for acquisition sake or diversify for diversification sake. It’s all going to be done that make sense to continue to increase value for shareholders with those actions.” (2015 Q4 Seeking alpha)

Well, it seems they are not willing to please wall street which loves a growth story and it seems management is disciplined. But where is the math to back it up? Well, I looked at how they could've spent their capital which was 364 million USD in 2012. Originally, taken out to buy Walker, they could have bought back shares or issued a dividend. 

Issue a dividend: I couldn't find anything in my notes about why they haven't issued a dividend but their philosophy is to maximize shareholder value and I am going to assume that they don't see dividends as a way to achieve that. Again, this is something I noted in many of the top performing companies. Many of them don't pay dividends.

Buy back shares: Between 2012 and 2015, EPS due to the acquisition of Walker has resulted in EPS CAGR of 38.92% (again I am removing the restructuring charge which boosted net income by 57 million USD). If instead they used the 364 million to buy back shares in 2012 for just that year? They would've been able to reduce shares by 49% if they bought at 11.09 (the high of that year). Now I would have to assume that their diversified product line didn't grow at its current rate. Instead I have to look at pre 2012 growth rates and use those rates to determine what the 2015 EPS without the acquisition would be.  I assumed a 5% growth in sales, and 3 % profit margin. 

WNC	               2011	  2012	2013	 2014    2015

Sales	               $1,187  $1,313 $1,357 $1,579 $1,841

Net Income        $15        $39      $41	  $47	    $55

At 36 million shares our EPS would go from .22 USD in 2011 to 1.53 USD in 2015. This is only an CAGR of 11.94%. Way below the 69.92% at which EPS are compounding currently. 

I believe management is disciplined as stated in many of their conference calls such as when the CEO stated: 

""What we have done as the orders were coming in late last fall in droves we were standing very firm and strict on our commitment to favor margin over volume. So we were looking at each one of those and adjusting pricing where we could. Remaining slots we have been extremely tight on scrutinizing just which order opportunities, which code opportunities has actually been converted to orders to get the most price benefit that we could out of them. So we've been very selective. We feel we've done a very good job with that..."" (Q1 2015 Seeking Alpha)

Because of this, margins have continued to increase even though sales have remained flat or decreased. Sales have increased by 11.52% CAGR from 2011 to 2015 while net income has had a CAGR of  28.99% in the same time period.

Management has also discussed paying down long term debt which is compromised of 150 millions USD in notes convertible due in 2018 issued to fund Walker acquisition. As shown in the 5 year financial ratios, WNC has decreased debt to equity from 1.55 in 2011 to .63 in 2015. Along the way, they have also repurchased 4.65 million shares in 2014 and reduce share count by 6%. Which was used for more than to just offset the stock options issued in the past 3 years which totaled a little over 1 million shares. This is something management talks a lot about: choosing between paying down debt, repurchasing stock, and making acquisitions.

**Intrinsic Value**: I used the following assumptions to arrive at my intrinsic values

**Terminal Growth Rate: 3%**

**Terminal Growth Years: 10**

**Discount Rate: 12%**

**Growth Rate Years: 3**

EPS: 1.80 USD

EPS growth at -8%: 10.17 USD (-22% Margin of Safety)

At growth rate of 0%: 12.64 USD (2 % Margin of Safety)

At growth rate of 5%: 14.38 USD (13 % Margin of Safety)

At growth rate of 10%: 16.28 (24% Margin of Safety)

During the final crisis of 2007, the companies worst drop in EPS in one year was 12%. They then posted 3 years of negative EPS. So I will assign the probability of 30% for this loss. Because of the past 10 years we had 3 that were negative. While I don't see another crisis as badly as 2007 looming, I will still assume that they company can lose 8% in EPS. 

Between 2011 and 2015 the EPS CAGR has been 62.92% 

(EPS in 2011 was .22 USD and in 2015 EPS was 1.55 USD). While impressive I don't think that's sustainable so I'd rather assume a conservative 10%. I assign a 10% probability of this happening.

For 0% growth and 5% growth I assume 30% probability and 20 % probability.

So the expected value is: 0.3*(10.17-12.44)+0.3*(12.64-12.44)+0.2*(14.38-12.44)+0.1*(16.28-12.44) = .151

In conclusion, the company has good management to sail it through a tough economic environment through disciplined spending and selling. I believe that in a few years, their integration of Walker will start to take place and bring up sales and margins and reduce their cyclical nature. But in the next few years, there is no guarantee that a downturn in the economy won't hurt their sales and hurt their ability to pay off debt. But as I showed above, the expected value of all the scenarios is positive so even if I lose money in case of a down turn I believe there is a bigger chance for me to break even or make money.

Just to be clear, I am a leaner and amateur in this field so my valuation certainly has a lot of flaws and one of the reasons I post it, it's because I want someone (possibly analysts and people in the finance) to point out where I am missing.

A quick recap of my assumptions:
Base year number TTM (2015 20-F - 2015 first quarter number + 2016 first quater number)
Revenues growth 25% for the next 5 years, and declining to 3% in year 10, after become a mature company.
unlevered beta 100% from internet sector firms average.
Country risk premium 100% from China as stated by the financials.

I valued the company in RMB curreny, once obtain the value per share in rmb I just divide by 6.70 to have the value in USD.

Very surpriced I got a very low number USD 94.50 (at least compared to the market price)

I am looking for some help to make my stock finder better. 

Currently it is filtering stocks as follows:

 * shareprice is less than 1.5 x book value
 * earnings per share is at least 2x bigger than dividend per share
 * dividend yield is more than 3%
 * 5yr PEG is between 0 and 1.1

What is your opinion on them? What should I change on my filters? What further analysis should I include?

With the above criteria I am filtering through 27 000 shares currently. It should take 3-4 hours I guess.

If you are interested in the technical side it is not that complicated:

1. Download Python 2.7
2. Download and install the Yahoo Finance API for pyhton : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance/1.1.4
3. Download a list of stocks for example from here: http://investexcel.net/all-yahoo-finance-stock-tickers/
4. Write the code. 

Here is a great example of it from jamescnowell: 
https://github.com/jamescnowell/screener

Some ideas for improvement:

 * Could someone review the filters I used? Is there maybe a better way, shall any of the filters be changed?
 * We might use SEC Data as well to have a more intelligent system. Here is a great free source for SEC Data updated on a daily basis: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4qxjr6/ive_processed_1tb_of_secs_data_to_extract/
 * Yahoo finance does not have all the data needed. If someone is interested in non US stocks a great data source might be: https://www.quandl.com/ Thanks for the idea OFFICIALDonaldJTrump

t3_4ufjxc,Trupanion (TRUP) - Pet Insurance,"I have been toying around with TRUP's revenue model for a while after coming across the company's annual shareholder letters (great reads, btw).  Essentially, they aim to be the GEICO of the pet insurance market that they argue is under-penetrated due to dysfunctional incentive structures by market participants and overall poor product quality.  

Uniquely, they are targeting vets by promising same day payments on claims with little to no paperwork/push-back with a cut upfront for the referral.  Apparently, pet insurance stands at just 1% penetration here in the US vs. 25% in the UK and 40% in Sweden.  They contend it is because lack of buy-in from service providers (i.e. vets) so getting them on-board is key to strategy.  

The model’s economics appear compelling at first glance with >50% IRRs (ex. G&A) on customer acquisition costs spent to bring on new members.  As G&A is relatively fixed, the scale affect on operating income is powerful as they march towards efficient scale of an estimated ~600k subs (vs. 288k current).  Further, given the characteristics of the insurance business, much of the growth is self-funded and over-time the company should continue to see releases of working capital as the float grows.  

Model example 
Acquire customer from vet referral for $120 dollar upfront payment at a 20% contribution margin on a $45 monthly premium, which lasts 6.1 years (1/churn rate), implies a high 60’s IRR. 

Variable costs are claims expense of 70% of revs and client servicing (e.g. claims processing) of 10% of sales. Fixed expenses represent G&A and technology which should scale positively and stabilize at 5% of sales at efficient scale.  

Pros

Subscription based cost plus model 

Potential secular growth story leveraging “pet huminzation” trend here in the US on the back of a under penetrated industry 

Growth is self-funded by FFO & working capital releases 

Owner/Operator/Founder CEO with 5% ownership 

Net cash balance sheet position 

Cons 

Superficially expensive stock and heavily shorted as bears focus on relative valuation to mature accident & health companies 

Monthly churn of 1.5% implies a 16.6% annualized “melting ice cube” dimension to revenues that must consistently be replaced to keep subs flat.  

50% of stock is VC owned 

Highly competitive space with much deeper pocketed competitors, including Prim Watsa from Fairfax financial  

Thinly capitalized relative to competitors 

Model extremely sensitive to customer acquisition costs & claims expense trends

Why compared to GEICO?  

Well they contend that they are structured to spend 70% of premiums on claims vs. peers that model 50% and still earn attractive returns on capital given unique operating, distribution, and financial model.  Over-time, this should create a better product in the consumer’s eyes reinforcing member growth trends and further leveraging the fixed cost base driving scale advantage.  

At 580k pets in 2021 (15% CAGR), the company should do $40-$45 million in EBIT while employing just ~$90 million of  invested capital representing capitalized acquisition costs of $120-$160/pet sub X 580,000 subs, which is increasingly financed by float.  

I know stocks like FAST were always expensive but still delivered low 20’s IRRs as they were able to deploy all FCF at high rates of return so I am trying to crack this nut by applying same approach.  

Any thoughts appreciated

** Update**
 
I believe it comes down to the company being able to deploy all FCF into new subs at historic ""normalized"" rates of return, which appear to be 25%-35%.  This implies IV growth of 25%-35% for a long time if 100% of FCFs are reinvested.  Under this approach, the stock could be cheap.

* I'm lucky enough to have access to a Bloomberg terminal at work

* i downloaded Free Cash Flow data for all SP500 constituents, along with their 'fully diluted market caps'

* I projected forward next 20 years the FCF for all ~500 businesses, using a very crude assumption that FCF will flat-line at the average of the preceding three years.

* Discounted cash flows at 9%, summed them all up and took this to be my own interpretation of the business' value

* Compared my calculated valuation versus current market cap, and noted down how many multiples higher the actual market cap is (i.e. how overpriced it is, relative to my very crude measure)

I figured this would give me an approximate sliding scale for rating SP500 businesses from 'hugely over priced' to 'hugely under priced'.

Without pasting the full set of results, my data indicated:
- oil/energy related companies were, perhaps unsurprisingly, rated as hugely overpriced. Phillips 66, Chesapeake Energy, Southwestern Energy, Ryder System, all big offenders in this regards

Delta Air Lines Inc
LyondellBasell Industries NV
CenturyLink Inc

I recognise my approach was incredibly simplistic, but wanted to possibly get a little conversation going about e.g.
(i) the virtues of DCF on FCF (for big businesses, a la SP500)
(ii) the validity of flat-lining future cash flows (because I'm not convinced this is a particularly less ridiculous attempt at predicting the future without crystal ball)
(iii) the four businesses that seem potentially under priced.

They also have the highest deposit balance/account and the best new employer metrics (acct maintenance costs, investment options, reputation, ect).

Analyzing commodity movements with trucking manufacturer WNC to guess gross marign going forward,"So I'm looking into a semitruck trailer manufacturer WNC and took hot roiled coil steel pricing and correlated it against material cost/new trailers delivered to see if I can surmise an impact here.  Just to start things off, the CFO had this to say about their material costs on the most recent conference call...

> <Q - Mike J. Baudendistel>: Thanks and good morning. I just want to ask you a question on the gross margin
percentage on the quarter, which I guess was a record. When I look at your Q, it looks like a lot of that was in the
commercial trailer segment related to material costs being down or at least not keeping us with price. Could you just
talk a little bit about, is there any sort of timing issue there with respect to material costs and how much of that is due to
commodity cost being down versus material taken out of trailers or any other issues there?

><A - Richard J. Giromini>: Yes, you get a little bit of both, we have done some component design optimization that
has benefited us in that regard. So there has been material cost that's been taken out from there. But on the raw
commodity side, we certainly have had some benefit from raw commodity environment. Just for some recollection for
everyone, on the aluminum and the hot rolled steel side of the business, we go out and take forward positions to – and
we price our product according to what the projections are for cost and then we actually go out and take forward
positions when we secure a firm order from customers.
So we mitigate any of the upside or downside that is associated with those commodities. So we don't see an impact
when it comes to aluminum and to hot rolled steel or the material that goes into rear frames and the bracketry systems
and all for landing gear.> 

Since I view this answer as the most difficult thing to interpret in the entire world (har har har) and there is no discussion about futures or forward contracts in the 10-Q [I went ahead and pulled the data that you can see here](http://imgur.com/a/m71D8), and it appears there is a significant correlation with steel pricing lagged over 4 quarters. At first I thought, great! With steel prices having fallen until this past quarter we should be in for more consistent margin growth.

Here's the thing though: this company typically turns inventory 10x/year. That says to me that this company is likely purchasing material to turn 2-3x/quarter, and that what I'm seeing should be a spurious correlation. Further, you'll notice in the unlagged chart [here](http://imgur.com/a/LBG1U) that there has clearly been a deviation in cost and steel prices this year. My guess is that they got really lucky on hedging earlier this year, but I can't determine anything here further as they don't discuss it in their 10-Q, and I'm trying to predict the gross margin in the quarters to come.

Any help coming to a conclusion here would be much appreciated.

t3_4zuoti,Benson Grahamathon and the wild story of Non-recurring losses,"I have a couple of questions that I've accumulated in my readings over the past few days:

- In Security Analysis Chapter 32, Graham talks a lot about the choice between charging certain extraordinary charges to income or to ""surplus."" When he says ""surplus"" is he referring to retained earnings? Like, is it possible to just directly lower retained earnings on the balance sheet without ever touching the income statement? I don't understand what this phrasing means.

- Also, Graham talks a lot about making adjustments to different companies' income statements so that their accounting methods will be made comparable. For example, he compares the statements of US Rubber and Goodyear for the years 1925-1927, and he shows three different methods of comparable accounting, depending on how you account for inventory loss reserves and actual inventory losses. My question is: It seems like if you were a professional investor who was keeping an eye on a set of companies over the course of several years, you would have to not only decide which method of accounting you were going to hold them to, but then also remember (or just make detailed notes in an excel spreadsheet) which method you were using from year to year. After many years of doing this, you would end up with your own ""adjusted"" financial statements that would look very much different from the actual financial statements that are filed by the companies. And I imagine that this would get really confusing. I guess I'm just asking how people deal with this. If I'm looking at a set of three companies in a particular industry in 2016, do I just arbitrarily go back five years to 2011, decide which accounting methods I'm going to use, and then make adjustments starting in 2011 to each company's statements until I'm all the way forward to 2016 and then I can compare? But shouldn't I actually start with the statements from the very inception of the company, so that I'm not starting in 2011 with a bunch of differently methodized statements? I obviously don't know shit about accounting, but the whole idea of this really messes with my head. 

- A question now from the book *Expectations Investing* by Michael Mauboussin. First off, I'm only 25 pages into this book but it seems like the basic idea of the book is to do a DCF model for a stock, but instead of making a series of assumptions to arrive at a calculation of ""intrinsic value,"" you use the current stock price as the market's estimation of intrinsic value and then just backsolve to see what the market expects in terms of cash flows and sales growth and shit. This is basically just algebraically rearranging an equation, not anything particularly crazy, but Mauboussin makes it seem like this is some super innovative new method for investing. I don't know. I'm only 25 pages in like I said. 

Anyway, on page 11 he says 

> Earnings do not recognize the cash outflows for investments in future growth, such as increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets.

Isn't this wrong? Earnings does account for increases in accounts receivable. Like, once you've recognized revenue, you see a corresponding increase in accounts receivable. Am I crazy?

- On the next page, he says

> Multibillion-dollar restructuring charges create ""cookie jar"" reserves that companies can use to fuel future, illusory earnings.

How does this work? I have no idea what this means

- Last question is from a passage on page 20:

> The discounted cash-flow model also dominates pricing in the commercial real estate market. When the Empire State Building went up for sale in the early 1990s, real estate experts pegged its market value at around $450M - and yet the purchase price was a scant $40M because of the building's long-term, below market rate master lease. Neither its marquee name nor its prime location set the Empire State Building's price. Its discounted cash flow value did.

Is this just saying that the owners of the ESB were locked in to where they could only charge really low values of rent for its tenants? Like, aren't most leases only 1 year long? Couldn't they just increase rent by 10x the next year?

t3_4zy823,Thoughts on Alibaba,"Recently, I have analyzed my position in [Alibaba Group](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/baba/quote.html) and there are some serious red flags I believe aren't necessarily reflected in the share price. This comes after the stock's recent run up, following the best year-over-year revenue growth rate [year-over-year revenue growth rate](http://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p160811.pdf) since its IPO. 

**Auditing**
For starters, many are skeptical as to who actually audits the company. The Hong Kong member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers signs off on each 20-F, but [some](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/can-we-trust-alibabas-numbers-auditor-has-never-faced-us-regulatory-scrutiny-2015-09-15) suspect that the audit is mostly done by the mainland member firm of PwC, Zhong Tian LLP. This suspicion is warranted; why would the HK member firm spend a substantial amount of time auditing in Hangzhou (Alibaba HQ) when there is already a [PwC office in Hangzhou?](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Price+Water+House+Coopers/@30.2738586,120.1593303,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x344c9d80d4b3464f:0xa1c2a0377ac5980b!8m2!3d30.273854!4d120.161519?) This would require PwCHK to send auditors to Hangzhou. If PwCHK isn't actually the principal auditor, then it is in violation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's  (PCAOB) auditing standards, [section 543](https://pcaobus.org//Standards/Auditing/Pages/AU543.aspx). However, the PCAOB is largely ignored in China; the board is forbidden from inspecting the Chinese firms and their U.S. listed audits (mainland or Hong Kong). As long as that continues, there is no telling whether PwCHK was actually the principal auditor. 

Moreover, why is the HK member firm engaged in Alibaba's audits in the first place? Nearly all of Alibaba's revenues and facilities are located in Hangzhou. Barron's supposes that a HK audit sign off is used to soothe investors' concerns over the 2012 SEC administrative proceedings against the mainland affiliates of the big four accounting firms. Though the case was settled in early 2015, there's a risk that if a few firms become non-compliant with documentation requests, the administrative proceedings could restart. Consequently, *if our independent registered public accounting firm, or the affiliate of our independent registered public accounting firm, were denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC, we would need to consider alternate support arrangements for the audit of our operations in China*. Remember, the proceedings were leveled against mainland firms, so surely the *affiliate* is a reference to Zhong. Furthermore, *if our auditor, or an affiliate of that firm, were unable to address issues related to the production of documents, and we were unable to timely find another independent registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to delisting of our ADSs from the New York Stock Exchange or deregistration from the SEC, or both. This would materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs and substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our ADSs in the United States. (FY2016 20-F;pp.49)* The auditing structure--much like the variable interest entities and Alipay ownership structure--is quite suspect.

**SEC Investigation**
More pressing is the recent SEC investigation that was revealed to investors in Alibaba's latest 20-F. It reported this:
*Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, informed us that it was initiating an
investigation into whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC has requested
that we voluntarily provide it with documents and information relating to, among other things: our consolidation
policies and practices (including our accounting for Cainiao Network as an equity method investee), our policies
and practices applicable to related party transactions in general, and our reporting of operating data from Singles
Day. We are voluntarily disclosing this SEC request for information and cooperating with the SEC and, through
our legal counsel, have been providing the SEC with requested documents and information.*
If the SEC forces Alibaba to consolidate its Cainiao operations, it could decrease net income by roughly RMB156 million. Though this will hardly effect non-GAAP net income of RMB29 billion, you have to wonder what related party transactions pertain to. Perhaps the abstract contracts with Alipay? In addition, any measures discrediting Singles' Days GMV count will adversely impact share price.

**Lawsuit**
In May 2015 Alibaba was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York by Kering S.A and other plaintiffs, concerning sales of counterfeit goods on Alibaba marketplaces. Thus far, Alibaba has been rather reactive, rather than proactive on protecting brands' intellectual property rights. Instead of actively targeting counterfeits, they merely react to voiced complaints customers and third party sellers. They have their own targeting system for these fakes, but I rarely hear impressive reports detailing crackdowns. I've only seen PR boosters from [WSJ op-eds](http://www.wsj.com/articles/counterfeit-goods-have-no-place-on-alibaba-1466635312) and the [company itself](http://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p151221.pdf). This aloofness will not help their case.

**Systemic Risk**
Also, there's been a lot of talk about an imminent collapse of China's economy. Notable forecasters include legendary short seller Jim Chanos, who has raised concerns about the debt/capital ratio of the country (300% of GDP), the real estate bubble, and the rapid decline in real GDP. George Soros claims China's credit growth will lead to a bigger crash than 2008. Stanley Druckenmiller stated that further stimulus provided the PRC central bank can't drive growth in the economy, which is already awash in credit. 
I always avoid blindly following the financial celebrities, but the given facts are hard to disregard. These are clear markers of an economy on the precipice of ruin. Surely this will hold back consumer spending habits and the rapid rise of the urban middle class, a projection essential to Alibaba's growth outlook. 

**Overwhelming Bullishness**
Lastly, investment experience has taught me that the market can move against the prevailing sentiment, especially when revealing facts are not incorporated into the general thesis. According to [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=BABA.N), about 90% of the analysts covering Alibaba have a buy or outperform rating on the stock. Sure, some of these analysts review Alibaba on a daily basis, and the latest quarterly report was promising. However, I'd expect at least a dozen analysts to recommend holding the stock considering all of these red flags. Maybe the market isn't being so efficient here. 

I bought into Alibaba when it was undervalued at roughly $70 a share. I quick look at the growth rates and a cheap reverse DCF calculation on [GuruFocus](http://www.gurufocus.com/dcf/BABA) gave me confidence that a margin of safety existed (Yes, in a Chinese Internet company!). But now all things considered, including an adjusted P/E of roughly 65 (excludes interest and investment income, which constitute nearly 65% of net income), the intrinsic value is hardly worth over $100. Amid all the strikes against the company, it'll take some real willpower to hold until it reaches the median PT of $110. 

As a risk averse investor, it seems like I should bow out of this play rather soon.

Any thoughts are welcome.

1) He says 

> Most value investors are specialists in either particular industries or certain special circumstances, such as bankruptcy workouts.

Is this true? I think of value investors as mostly generalists, but maybe I'm just thinking of the older guys like Buffett, Schloss, Klarman.

2) Here's another quote, in a section of the book where he's disparaging DCF valuation models:

> The present value approach in practice relies on information - parametric values for operating variables - that is often not knowable, especially in the distant future.

What does he mean by ""parametric values for operating variables""?

3) When making adjustments to the assets on the balance sheet in order to determine the ""reproduction value"" of the assets (i.e. what it would cost a competitor to come in and compete), he likes to try to take into account ""the cost of reproducing the engineering knowledge, images, dealer network, and organizational experience of the corporation"", and he typically uses three years of R&D costs to estimate this. I have many questions about this:

- Why wouldn't the company just poach employees from an already existing company instead of ""building up engineering knowledge""?

- Why use R&D expenses instead of SG&A?

- Why three years? Why not more or less?

- Wouldn't it take a real industry insider in order to determine these values? How would a generalist even know how much this stuff would cost to replicate?

3) Quote:

> We estimate that the cash most businesses need to run their operations amounts to about 1 percent of sales

Why? Also, in a low interest rate environment like today, wouldn't it make sense to keep some excess cash on the balance sheet, since the opportunity cost is less?

4) I'm not sure I really understand the concept of a ""LIFO reserve"". Any help on this?

5) I'm not sure I really understand the whole ""some companies earnings must be reinvested in the business in order to maintain market share, and can't be distributed to shareholders, so it's not real earnings."" 

Like, I understand that if a company must be constantly making maintenance capital expenditures for repairs on its factories and equipment, then these costs are capitalized and not expensed until later periods. But then in later years, these costs *are* expensed. So over the long run, not on a one year basis but on a decades-long basis, don't earnings always represent what can be distributed to shareholders?

t3_51dao1,"Useful criteria to screen for ""buy and hold"" type stocks","I've been going through a lot of old posts looking for gems, and I found this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4zzj16/alright_my_turn_post_your_stocks_and_get_a_full/). And within the comments, /u/dvdmovie1 lists his criteria. It seems like exactly how Buffett screens for his companies.

Here is his comment, copied and pasted:

""This is what I'm looking for. Again, I am not saying that this is ""the one way"" by any means. It's simply the things I am looking for when I am looking for potential long-term investments - and really, I buy with the intent to own for the long-term. I'm tired of all the trying to time this, that and the other. I'm not going to re-position and re-think for every Fed speech, I'm not going to try to endlessly tweak and stress over what I own and this is an attempt to find those longer-term names where I don't feel as if that's required.

1. Moat. I do not buy something if I don't feel the company has a moat/barriers to entry. That's really a huge thing to me, as I'm buying businesses that I want to own for 3-5 years and - hopefully - beyond. I do not want anything where I feel that someone else can do the same thing tomorrow. Whole Foods was a growth story and Whole Foods believed that no one else could do what they do. Well, no: everyone could do what they do and soon enough, they did. Whole Foods has admitted as such and now the growth story is over. They are scrambling to do this (open up smaller stores in an already overcrowded grocery market to emphasize their cheaper 365 product when they should have been doing that years ago in anticipation of the inevitable point where everyone would do the same thing), that (rewards program) and the other (be more promotional.)

2. Part of a durable theme. I try to identify what I believe are durable, long-term themes that I want to capitalize on. This can be as simple as a continued rise in pet ownership and spending money on pets. It may be something like the era of big data and associated infrastructure. It could be an acceleration away from B & M retail as more and more retailers face the reality that retail is overbuilt in this country and store counts are going to shrink. It could be something like more and more people growing their own fruits and vegetables and greater consumption of prepared/fresh as the freezer section declines. It may be alternatives to traditional sweeteners as people move away from sugar, yet still want sweetness in their drinks and foods. It could be many things. When I say durable, I mean....

3. ...not a fad. I do not want to have to babysit investments, I don't want to try and sit there and time the cooling of a trend and I definitely have no interest in trying to chase trendy investments. People can do very well with fads, but most people do not: the fad cools considerably and people don't exit it (see GPRO). I don't like apparel, I don't like fickle consumer plays - and the consumer is ultimately fickle. Michael Kors (KORS) was an incredibly hot stock until it wasn't. To quote ""Project Runway"", ""As you know in fashion, one day you're in. And the next day, you're out."" Have no interest in that. Also have no interest in...

4. ...drama. Especially stupid drama. Lululemon (LULU) has mostly done well for investors over the years. I'll question the moat, but beyond that, shit like promoting your clothing has seaweed in it and then it doesn't makes my eyes cross. I have no tolerance for inane bullshit like that.

5. Quality management. I want shareholder-friendly management that has consistently demonstrated a track record of shareholder returns. Look at some of the greats: look at John Malone's Liberty companies. Look at Danaher. Look at Bill Stiritz, formerly of Ralston Purina, now of Post Holdings. Berkshire. Markel. BAM. Middleby. Casey's.

6. Stable, consistent growth. I am looking for companies that hit the ball year in/year out. Fiserv is a fine example. Danaher. Visa. Ecolab.

7. Tangible assets. I do like to devote a good deal to tangible assets, including even things like land and water rights play Limoneira (LMNR), as well as a number of REITs and other companies (pipelines, infrastructure, etc.)

8. Needs. Does the company satisfy a need/address a problem? While not every investment is going to focus on ""needs"", a good deal of them do. Ecolab: giant hygiene and sanitation company: restaurants and grocery stores need to stay clean and follow food safety standards, hotels need to get rid of pests, etc.

9. Compelling valuation.

10. Dividend is a plus, most things I own pay a dividend, whether tiny or significant (or in-between.)

Bonus: I tend to like companies higher up the pyramid that deal with all of an industry rather than a specific player or just broader plays in general.

To offer an example of the kind of thing I'm talking about, rather than betting on a particular chain restaurant I'd rather bet on a Middleby (MIDD) that sells equipment to any restaurant and they are an enormous innovator for a lot of things that are behind-the-scenes at Starbucks, Subway, Chipotle, Chik-Fil-A, Dominos and elsewhere. Thermo Fisher is another one of these sorts of ""picks and shovels"" plays, only for science.

Additionally, for those who watch to watch a highly entertaining CEO speech, here's one from the Middleby CEO from a couple of years ago at the Baron Funds Conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL-jQwpZ5Ag
In terms of a broader play, I like Visa as a broad play on consumer spending where I'm getting something that will benefit with greater consumer spending, whether it be online or B & M, and I don't have to bet on a particular retailer that may or not may not have the right mix of products this quarter or may go through any number of other problems.) With Visa, the concerns are regulatory and to some degree technological advancement, it's not betting on a clothing retailer who didn't have a good quarter because they got stuck with too many Winter clothes during a warmer-than-expected Winter. Inane stuff like that starts to get into #4 above.

Lastly, I also like to focus on companies with considerable recurring revenue. Ecolab is heavily consumables that have to be reordered frequently.""

t3_51j713,Capitalizing R&D - Tax Benefit?,"Hi All,

I am working on building R&D capitalization into my DCF model and am confused on the tax benefit from this reclassification from operating to capital expense.

Specifically, does the tax benefit only last for the current year in which we are capitalizing the expense, or does this benefit last into our forecast period?

I was reviewing Damodaran's valuations for Tesla and noticed that he doesn't add the tax benefit to his FCF forecasts, so I am thinking that the tax benefit only exists for the current year and is an artifact of the reclassification, but won't be present in future years. (http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/03/return-to-firing-line-revisiting-tesla.html) Damodaran calculates the tax benefit (see ""R&D converter"" sheet), but then does not incorporate it into his model and does not add it to current year's NOPAT when calculating ROIC (cell B40, ""Valuation output"" sheet), so he's got me a little confused.

Pragmatically, my question is: when forecasting FCF, do we just need to adjust the pre-tax operating margin by the difference between the R&D Expense and R&D Amortization and multiply the resulting EBIT by (1-tax) to arrive at NOPAT, or do we need to add the tax benefit to this NOPAT figure to arrive at the correct estimated for our forecast of NOPAT?

Forecasted NOPAT:
1: (Unadjusted EBIT + R&D Exp - R&D Amort)*(1-tax)
or
2: (Unadjusted EBIT + R&D Exp - R&D Amort)*(1-tax)+tax benefit
where Tax Benefit = (R&D Exp - R&D Amort)* tax

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

t3_53smgu,Credit Acceptance : A Structural Short,"http://seekingalpha.com/article/4007510-credit-acceptance-structural-short

I recommended shorting the shares of Credit Acceptance (CACC) at the beginning of this year (read here), arguing that the imbalances brewing up in new vehicle market will manifest into used vehicle market resulting in severe headwinds for the company.  The stock has lost 7% on an YTD basis, although it was down by more than 20% at one point this year (in June), with the post-Brexit rally helping to recover the majority of those losses. The time elapsed since my recommendation gave me the opportunity to take a deeper look at the company’s accounting policies, review its relationships with dealers, keep a close-eye on the trends unfolding in the industry and lastly engage in discussions with fellow investors to get a handle on the wide variety of opinions surrounding it.  Interestingly, it’s the narrowly held opinions in the marketplace that serve as the fertile ground for the collective wisdom of crowds to fail, putting odds in our favor. 
So what are the collective opinions about Credit Acceptance? 
a)	A differentiated business model that allows CACC to make loans that have higher returns and lower risk than its auto lending peers despite it targeting a weaker consumer segment (Sub/Deep Prime). 
b)	CACC is in the 2nd loss position as dealers hold the 1st loss position in this transaction, bestowing a big margin of safety to CACC. Hence, the justification for the premium valuation relative to its peers.
c)	CACC program allows dealers to make sales and profits which they wouldn’t have otherwise. 
d)	The spread, difference between forecasted collection rate and the advance rate has never gotten to zero since the company went public in 1992. 
e)	The company’s auto loans performed remarkably well during the great financial crisis of 2008, and if the capital markets didn’t freeze up, CACC would have captured a bigger market share. 
f)	Fears related to an auto loan bubble are over-blown. 
And, what were the questions that fueled my cynicism?
a)	Why should a dealer sign up with CACC’s program especially when they have plenty of auto-financing options available from Santander Consumer USA (SC), Nicholas Financial (NICK), Consumer Portfolio Services (CPSS), and Wells Fargo (WFC)? 
b)	How much an independent dealer can make in profits with the CACC program? More importantly, why CACC’s conventional program isn’t attractive enough for the franchised dealerships. 
c)	Why the company has only been able to retain 5K dealers despite enrolling more than 20K dealers to its program since 2006?
d)	Besides the atypical deal structure (Dealer- CACC side of equation), what’s the value proposition for the consumer- ability to finance, state & price of the vehicle, or the loan terms.
e)	Why is the company so reluctant to share any credit performance metrics with investors unlike all other players in this industry?  
Before we embark on our journey to find answers to aforementioned questions, let’s dig a little deeper to understand the economics of a loan:-
CACC advances a portion of the expected future cash flows to the auto dealer at origination (~ 44% of the Loan amount (Principal + Interest). Collections on the consumer loan are allocated first to Credit Acceptance to pay its 20% servicing fee. The dealer loan made by CACC is then repaid in full before any payments are made to the dealer (80% of collections after paying advance loan) with respect to the dealer holdback. In theory, the holdback amount cushions Credit Acceptance against the losses on the consumer loans since 80% of losses come out of the dealer holdback - a fact clearly visible in its annual filings before 2003. But in reality, CACC projects a forecasted collection rate (outlined in red- Table 2) to the gross amount of consumer contract (Principal + Interest) - given the credit profile of the borrower and employs this projection to determine the amount it is willing to advance to the dealer. This adjustment, however, changes the dealer holdback economics sharply.

80% of collections forecast $	$8,792

Dealer Holdback ( before fees) 	$1,694 

A dealer's holdback changes from $5986 per contract (100 % collection) to $1694 / contract (before fees- forecasted collection rate). A 33% haircut to the gross installment contract turns into a 72% haircut in potential profit for the dealer.  On the other hand, servicing fee revenue for CACC drops from $ 3271 (20% x $16354 -100% collection) to $2198 (20 % x 67.20 % x $16354) ~ $1073 per contract. In other words, for each dollar CACC loses in its servicing revenue, a dealer loses $4 of holdback payments. That’s, unquestionably, one hell of a risk sharing agreement from CACC’s perspective but a sucker’s bet for a dealer. 

This demands serious introspection by investors as why would dealers agree to this model considering they are accepting a lower up-front cash payment, and hoping that after 2-3 years of sale they would begin to earn their back-end profit of $900 per car .  Kindly note, that until a dealer closes a loan pool (100 contracts), their holdback is withheld by the company.  To provide context, new active dealers have historically done 16 loans / year with CACC, while the average volume /dealer has hovered near 37 loans per year. Clearly a lot of wait time for the dealers before they see their holdback payments. 

I believe, the way and context in which dealers receive information from CACC profoundly influences their decision to enroll with CACC’s program. First, CACC's uniquely structured deal is the only such program in the lending industry, thus absent any comparable program- dealers rely heavily on the first piece of information offered to them- which in this case is the potential of fat-checks at the back-end. 

CACC’s management asserts their program allows the dealers to generate incremental sales that otherwise would be unavailable to them since their program guarantees 100% approval.  And to substantiate this claim, I reached out to few dealers but was taken aback by a comment made by one particular dealer –it allows them to sell end of life cars that otherwise would be scrapped.

Management notes that 70 % of the company’s dealer partners are independents, and their program allows independents to compete with the established franchise dealerships. Interestingly, the management acknowledged on the recent Q2-FY16 earnings call (link here) the challenges it faces in order to penetrating larger franchise dealer segment. An astute reader, at this point, may ask if a program isn't economical for franchise dealers with fast inventory turnovers than how is it economical for independents.  I’d note that industry wide gross margins for used vehicles have been in an unrelenting decline after a short lived uptick in 09, as shown below. 

 


It seems, to offset the punishment of lower margins, independent dealers are left with no choice but to inflate the price of the car until it escapes the ‘monthly affordable payment' a customer's psychological barrier.  Or, they are forced to buy inventory at the very back end of the black book- suggesting stretched loan to value ratios. 

CACC’s nearest competitor America’s Car-mart (CRMT) has historically paid nearly 80% of CACC’s advance amount ($5825 versus $6886 for CACC) to acquire their inventory. This spread, however, began to invert starting Q1-FY15 and fast forward to Q3-CY16 CACC’s advance amount ($5620 / unit) now sits at 80 % of what CRMT ($6925/ unit) is currently paying to acquire their used cars. Gross margin headwinds surrounding CRMT for the last 7-8 quarters are very well known to investor community. CACC’s loan term is almost 2 x. longer than CRMT’s (53.2 months vs. 30 months). The belief that declining advance amount reflects mitigation of risk on CACC’s part; these beliefs are myopic and fail to comprehend industry dynamics.  If the current industry dynamics continue, CACC’s dealers will be forced into difficult decisions to force back-end inventory on their consumers or demand advance amount materially above today’s rates –driving CACC spread lower. 

 


The overarching question is how it translates into CACC's financials. And this is where it gets trickier because the management shuns any conversation regarding loss rates, deficiency loss or the true charge-offs. Rather, it steers investors towards the consistency exhibited by the forecasted collection rates it discloses to construct a coherent story for the coherence-seeking investor mind, who more or less follow a list of boxes that must be checked before making an investment decision. During my conversations with longs, I made a disconcerting observation that investors indeed assign a heavy weight to the forecasted collection rates, sometimes to the point they are disregarding subsequent information plainly because peeling it away is rather discomforting.  


Forecasted Collections and Losses

2015 forecasted percentage at the end of Q2-FY16 was 67.0 %, a 40 bps decline q/q, or 186 bps decline y/y, the biggest decline for any vintage in 22 quarters. Additionally, I’d note that 2015 vintage had 23.2% of collection realized compared to 28.7%/26.5%/26.2%/25.8%/25.6% for 2010/2011/2012/2013/2014/2015, lowest collection among the vintages issues after 2010.  2016 vintage even though had a very little seasoning to them so far, had 5.0% of collection realized , compared to 6.2% / 6.3% / 5.9% / 6.0% / 5.6%  for 2011/2012/2013/2014/2015 vintages.  

 

The question arises how these collections transpire into the finance charges? Finance charges according to the company’s 10-K comprise of 1) servicing fees earned as a result of servicing consumer loans assigned to them, which generally equals 20 % of collections, 2) finance charge income from purchased loans, 3) fees earned from third party ancillary product offerings, 4) monthly program fees of $599 charged to dealer dealers under the portfolio program; and 5) fees associated with certain loans; 

And, we can reasonably estimate the cash collections realized by the company during any given year using two methods:-
a)	Principal Collected for Dealer Loan  plus accretion  ( From Note 5 in 10K’s)
b)	Cash collected for each year vintage using credit metrics the company provides (See Appendix-Table 1), and we arrive at same numbers using method a) as well. 

I demonstrate in the table below, that finance charges generated from its portfolio (20% of cash collected) and purchased program (cash collections –principal collected) only make-up two-thirds of its total revenue while the monthly program fees ($599 / month) & the fees earned from 3rd party ancillary product offerings account for the remaining 30 % of the revenues (excluding 5% fees with-held from holdbacks).

Average yield (finance charges / average net loans receivable balance) on CACC's portfolio program is meaningfully lower than reported – 16.8% versus 25.8% widely reported and purchased program yield stands at 18.7% for FY15.

After adjusting the fees (~5%) the company nets out from the holdback payments, I note a shortfall of 480 bps between the reported yields and the estimated.

One wonders “Why would CACC leave that amount on the table by not netting out this amount from the advance at the time of contract assignment to mitigate its risk?”  Evidently, netting this amount upfront from the dealer advance renders the transaction completely uneconomical for the dealers.   The excess amount booked as revenue (~ $136 m for FY15, ∆ Yields x Avg. Rec. Balance) appears to originate from the cash that CACC withholds from the dealers who haven’t closed a loan pool, and treats the cash collected from consumer repayments as its own. It is worth noting that only 50 percent of dealers are able to close a loan pool with the company. I emailed the company’s investor relations the following question 

“During our last conversation, you stated almost fifty percent of your dealers are able to close the pool. Does CACC retain all the back-end money on the loans from dealers who haven't closed a pool yet?""  

After some back and forth emails, I received a reply that confirms this transaction.

Me: “Got it, so less than 50 percent of dealers close a pool and those who don't their hold-back is retained by the Credit Acceptance”.
IR: ""Yep.""  

The aforementioned answer is consistent with my belief that the amount withheld is indeed booked as finance income charge on the income statement, but the associated liabilities of paying out to the dealer once aren’t recognized anywhere on its balance sheet. A counter-argument could be made that contractual obligations of holdbacks are contingent upon the receipt of consumer payments and the repayment of the advance, thus allowing CACC to retain this amount.  The notion that a company can use consumer payments collected on behalf of its dealers, yet somehow withhold the excess amount and use that substantial amount in ways that have not been explained to its investors is astonishing.  

The table below shows my estimate of what CACC could be liable for holdbacks in the next four years ~ $1.0 billion.  This sort of financial engineering not only helps in overstating top line revenue but also helps in masking the real net debt the company owes.  Adjustments to offset financial engineering profits, results in a leverage ratio of 10.2 x versus 7.6 x ( Debt / EBITDA) or  3.0 x versus 2.2 x ( Debt / Equity), suggest the investors , lenders are completely misjudging CACC's true value, health, and risk.

 

Charge-offs absorbed 

Another investor favorite metric to strengthen their argument is lower charge-offs compared to its peers.  Investors, I’d argue are failing to consider alternative explanations that help in uncovering the real charge-offs experienced by the business. And, to bring some light on the true credit metrics of the business, let’s go down the memory lane to refresh ourselves on CACC, as well its accounting policies.

Since going public in 1992, the company listed dealer holdbacks, net as a liability on its balance sheet, and maintained a reserve of advance losses which were charged off or partially charged off when the company's analysis determined the expected discounted cash flows associated with the related loans were insufficient to recover the outstanding balance in the pool. Just to put it in perspective, the company charged off nearly $760 million against the dealer holdbacks from 1999 to 2003. An estimated 80% of charge-offs were absorbed by the dealer-holdback this way (In discussion with management, they affirmed holdbacks continue to absorb nearly 80 % of losses). 

But effective July 1, 2003, the company retroactively eliminated the reserve for advance losses balance, which was previously classified within dealer holdbacks, net and transferred the balance into the allowance for credit losses which is classified within Loans receivable, net. Readers should note that following these modifications, the company ran into issues with their previous auditor Deloitte, purely on the auditor's assertion that the company should account for its loans as a servicer of loans in conjunction with being a lender to those dealers.  SEC in June 2005, informed the company's method of accounting should change to ‘servicer of loans' and ‘a lender to those dealers,' rather an originator of consumer loans. The company changed its accounting which allows for finance charges to be recognized based upon forecasted cash flows not based on the life of the underlying asset. Subsequently, the company inserted the policy of not writing off loans once there is no forecasted future flows on any of the associated consumer loans, which occurs 120 months after the last consumer assignment.  

The company’s liquidity and capital resources explanation in their annual filings changed radically from 2011 onwards to ‘We need capital to maintain and grow our businesses from ‘We need capital to fund new Loans and pay Dealer Holdback”.

Management’s assertion that holdbacks continue to absorb nearly 80% of losses suggests from 2006 to 2015 approximately $4.4 billion of losses (cumulative holdback payments: $888.6 million divided by 20%) had been charged-off this way. 

 

Despite having a charge-off policy remarkably different from its competitors such as Nicholas Financial (NICK), Car-mart (CRMT) (120 months vs. 9-10 months), CACC's charge-off to liquidation or charge off as a percentage of average net loans receivable is nearly  6 x worse than its peer NICK.

Finally, let’s debunk the fallacy of limited losses that the company faced during the 2008’s financial crisis. Considering the primary risk to CACC emanates from the loss of servicing fees on contractually delinquent accounts, estimating its effective servicing fees (20 % x Forecasted Collection Rate) is fairly simple.  We can notice in the table below the effective servicing fee for CACC since 2006, as well as the credit loss provisions. 

 

 Portfolio Prog.

Allowance for Credit Losses (Derived)	($67)	($78)	($72)	($50)	($81)	($134)	($148)	($155)	($175)	($280)

	53%	59%	64%	46%	72%	94%	89%	84%	89%	119%

From 2011 to 2015, the credit loss provisions (derived) were more or less in line with the reported financials, but I note servicing fee loss only made up 55 % of loss provisions from 2006 to 2009. Seemingly, these provisions reflect the losses for certain vintages which extended beyond the losses absorbed by the holdbacks. And these losses, in my view, would have suffered meaningfully absent ‘cash for clunkers’ program announced during the depth of financial crisis to give a life line to ailing auto-industry. 


Sustainability of dealer growth

Management points to 55k dealers as their TAM, but the real number is probably closer to 40-50% of the stated TAM, reflecting the nonprime & subprime market.  The company has grown its active dealer base by 4x since 2006, and management suggests it can double the dealer-base 1-2 x to present its case for more than enough runway ahead of it.  Investors meanwhile failed even to ask the reasons for massive attrition witnessed from 2007 to 2015.  CACC, effectively saw an attrition rate of ~65% after signing up nearly 15K dealer partners since 2007, out of which only 5k turned into active dealers. I remain puzzled by why; a company given such a long runway behind it is still unable to stop mighty dealer- attrition.

For Q2-16, active dealers were down 4 % q/q, the first decline in eight quarters, and the management attributed this decline to an increasingly competitive environment during the Q&A session on the conference call.  Dealer attrition of 17.2% was highest in the last five years while the volume per dealer continued to decline in 1H16, down by 2% y/y in Q2-16.  The most important revelation during the conference call was the penetration headwinds the company faces with their traditional (portfolio) loan program.   (Link for Earnings Call Transcript).

It shouldn’t strike surprising to anyone that large dealers aren’t finding CACC’s traditional program attractive enough now that we know that it isn't as profitable as initially narrated.  CACC , it seems exists solely to hollow out the capital from the dealers by forcing an abusive transaction on them  and exorbitant interest rates from the consumers. 

The last argument left in bulls quiver rests on the management's track record in capital allocation considering CACC has bought back nearly 50 % of their stock since 2001. If, CACC stopped growing its balance sheet, would the business actually generate free cash?  I believe the company now finds itself in a vicious cycle where it can only re-purchase shares marginally by raising more debt as demonstrated in the cash flow projection below. Really, what is the point of CACC growing if, after all of this time, it still can-not generate cash?  CACC has been free cash flow positive only once in the last ten years.

* NTQ LN Equity/Enteq Upstream (Which I will be bidding for at 15.50 - just a handful of shares to put some money where my mouth is, and because I'm encouraged at the sight of one of the current large shareholders).

* SRS AU Equity/www.spicers.com.au: A long running paper merchant trading in deep value territory. They made a very costly and failed expansion attempt in to Europe and Canada in last few years. I think management are committed to turning this around... but lots of liabilities and possible pension/legal challenges overhanging from their EU/CAD retreat.

* SBB AU Equity/www.sunbridge.com.au: looks very strong on balance sheet. Sells sunglasses, tonnes of cash assets, few liabilities, but it has strong Chinese links and I wouldn't trust this stock with an investment. Website is crap too. No sir.

Canada, similar to Australia in terms of focus on basic material businesses. Some highlights included:

* SEC CN Equity/www.senvest.com; some sort of investment/holding firm, too big and complex for me to really understand what was going on. Looked interesting on balance sheet.

* NFD/A CN Equity/www.northfieldcapital.com; Very few liabilities, considerable assets including cash. As above, its value is derived from its holdings of other businesses. I don't feel comfortable in this ""holdings"" space though.

Japan... lots of eligible stocks. But where english is not the first language for a businesses' website/marketing material etc, seems like a space for gamblers to me.

* 4840 JP Equity/www.triis.co.jp; strong balance sheet, relatively few liabilities and a cash balance that nearly equals market cap.

* 3770 JP Equity/www.zappallas.com. None functioning website. Good balance sheet (to my untrained eye anyway)... lots of cash, few liabilities. They seem to operate in the digital space i.e. are not fixed asset heavy.

t3_55o3ow,What is your favorite method of capital allocation?,"I have been thinking about this a lot recently, possibly because it is one of my favorite topics in business. 

What is your favorite method for a management team to allocate capital. Put differently, what is your favorite method of cash being returned to shareholders? 

I think they are all pretty subjective to the particular business situation, but I have some general thoughts on each. 

**Capital Expenditures**: This is the yardstick that all forms of capital allocation should be measured against. Capex is great because it does two things: 1) improve the general quality of a businesses core operations, and 2) allow a business to expand into new territory. Through the income generated we can calculate the return on capital for capital expenditures - especially if you can break the biz down to unit economics and say ""this is what a new store costs, and this is how much profit you get in year 1, 2, and 3"" - boom, instant credibility for why you spent the money. However, as economic laws tell us, the bigger a business gets and the more profit it generates it becomes harder and harder to sustain a high return on capital. In my opinion, if a business cannot earn a high enough return on capital in excess of its cost of capital it should not spend capital on capex, but rather one of the other methods below. 

**Dividends**: Useless in my opinion. I know many people like this, and I understand why, but if I think of capital allocation as a way to maximize my company's returns on capital I just don't see any value created from dividends. I understand that it increases *my* return on capital as a shareholder, but I would rather capital go towards improving the business in some form. People often critique buybacks as what businesses do when they run out of ideas, I would suggest that its really dividends that fit that summary. 

**Buybacks**: On that topic, I view buybacks as a double edged sword. Buybacks can be a businesses best friend, especially in the hands of an activist. Lets look at both sides. On one hand, buybacks are great if the business is undervalued, especially if management thinks the business is so undervalued that they can earn a higher return on capital buy repurchasing shares as opposed to other methods of capital distribution. This is a net positive for everyone. On the businesses side, they earn a high return on capital through buying undervalued shares, and as a shareholder my slice of the pie increases - even more so with aggressive buyback plans. On the other hand, buybacks can be a great way to simply light money on fire. Here are some ways that I have seen this happen 1) the business is overvalued and the share price declines heavily after a large buyback program, 2) the business fundamentals are deteriorating and the buyback plan is just enough to meet EPS targets when net income is falling, and 3) large issuances of stock options and other dilutive securities would increase the number of shares outstanding, so buybacks are put in place to ""even out"" the effect and keep shares outstanding normalized. 

**Debt Repayment**: I really like this method of capital allocation. Repaying debt does two things: 1) it de-leverages the balance sheet, and 2) it reduces your interest expense payments which boosts net income. The net effect if an increasing ROIC numerator and denominator that stays the same (if I have $110 gross capital and $10 cash, my net invested capital is $100. If I buyback $10 of debt with cash then my gross capital is $100 and with $0 cash my net capital is still $100)  - thus increasing ROIC. This is also a good way to get creditors off your back if you're getting close to a stressed capital structure, and when done aggressively, can be a very positive change for businesses. A lot of times I see this with businesses that re-IPOd after having been owned by PE for a number of years. A lot of times investors can get frustrated with this method because it takes a while to shed the LBO debt before other forms of capital allocation can take place. 

**M&A**: Not quite tied with dividends for how useless this is, but a close second. I only say that because this method is not as cut and dry as the effect of buybacks or debt repayment, or even capex, on returns on capital because the success/failure of M&A is tied to the execution ability of the management team and whether or not ""synergies"" are actually attainable. PCP, for example, was a business that executed M&A very well and actually implemented internal ROIC targets for the operations of the new biz that needed to be achieved. In cases like this, value can be created. But for every successful M&A operation there are probably a dozen or so more that fail to deliver any value-add and probably destroy value if anything. 

So that was kinda a long rant on the subject, but I'm curious as to what you guys think about this topic. ",17,0.81,1475507543,"[['ROIC', 2]]",ROIC,20.8799991607666,20.790000915527344

It has a dividend payout ratio of 33%, and retains all remaining profits for growth/debt service. Hence, cumulative real dividends should equal 1/3 of $2,522m, or $840m.

Therefore, net present value of FCF should be cumulative dividends + realizable value, i.e. $840m + $1,800m = $2,640m.

Is this correct?

The commentary in these subs become the ""new"" analysis that is compelling because some of these people come up with legit stats at times way better than what we see from disney's media.

Today I came across [this Motley Fool article](http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/11/23/1-way-qualcomm-inc-is-leaving-intel-corporation-in.aspx), and I started to write a post in response defending my beloved Intel. But after looking at some more data online I'm not so sure. The article claims Intel is under threat from Qualcomm's accelerated development cycle in mobile chips, compared to Intel's recently decelerated cycle of 3 years. I take issue with this stance primarily because since at least 2014, Intel doesn't seem to be competing in that market segment anymore. Instead they've slowly shifted resources to their data center group, which has seen its share of Intel's revenues grow 10% over the past five years. Data centers are definitely a market Intel can be and is competitive in, with 99% of the market share according to [these guys](http://marketrealist.com/2016/04/will-competition-affect-intels-dominance-data-center-market/).

But wait, that last article revealed some things to me I had somehow missed. IBM and Qualcomm are breaking into the data center market as well, and now [even Nvidia is getting into the game](http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/08/15/what-led-to-the-surge-in-nvidias-data-center-revenues-in-q216/#2f0c1b515120)? This doesn't look as bright as I'd hoped for.

I'm still going to hang onto Intel for now. IBM and Qualcomm are just appearing on this battlefield and it'll be some time yet before either of them can make a significant dent in Intel's market share if we're strictly talking about processors, chipsets, and motherboards. Nvidia getting into the game is a great big looming cloud on the horizon, though. I've long suspected that Nvidia has the potential to shove Intel out of the processor market the way they've shoved AMD out of the GPU market if they devoted the appropriate resources to it, and it looks like those guns are coming to bearing. 

Anything can happen in the future, and unfortunately for me it looks like a lot of hopes and expectations have already been priced into NVDA's stock, making it too ""expensive"" for me as an investor. That being said, my confidence in my vision of the future has been rattled and I'm definitely giving the attention now that I perhaps should have before buying into Intel in the first place.",7,0.77,1479941634,"[['IBM', 2], ['AMD', 1]]",IBM,161.36000061035156,162.1999969482422
t3_5er6r6,What kind of multiples/valuations do you see the Canadian Marijuana LPs getting if recreational is made legal?,"So most of us can price out the approximate gross revenues of the recreational market; from there, pricing out where the LPs/growers will be valued is a further equation of net margins/market shares/capex/etc (standard valuation metrics). Now, for the two scenarios I see playing out for the Canadian Marijuana Industry, one lends itself to higher multiples while the other leads to lower multiples.  
  
I see lower valuations/multiples coming from a loosely regulated market. With bulk retail sales you will just buy strain X from a jar and pay whatever the price it is; i see no differentiation of brand in this scenario and since all of these companies have the potential to grow all the same strains, commoditization of price should occur. In this scenario the low-cost producers benefit the most, and then the industry valuations will be lower because margins will be squeezed and net margins will end up at lower levels; less net revenue/commodity pricing leads to lower multiples, less differentiation of product.  
  
But, I do believe the most probable scenario with higher valuations/multiples will come from a highly regulated climate, with prepackaged goods and regulated pricing; this will relieve some downward pressure on pricing that would come from commodity pricing of bulk goods. If prepackaged goods are mandatory as well, then branding will play a large part in retail sales. Branding means people will pick your product over competitors, so you have better pricing power and market share (better pricing power = better margins, higher market share = higher revenue). In this case, I see potential for companies capturing higher market shares (due to branding) and I see higher net margins due to more pricing power; due to these factors, I see higher potential valuations/multiples.  
  
Not to mention the probable higher multiples due to being an eternal, defensive industry (a lot of famous investors talk about the best investments being the ones you can forget about for 100 years, ill argue Marijuana being one of the more eternal industries). Lower CAPEX required to run the business (Which means margin protection). With the industry being brand new, ill argue that 20 years of recreational sales being the norm will be a huge factor in eliminating negative stigmas associated with marijuana; this should increase consumption and gross revenues. Highly regulated climate also means potential barriers of entry for LPs and could mean all sales going through very few establishments (provincially owned), so you know your brand will be in every store.  
  
Im rambling, but does anyone else see how a highly regulated marijuana retail climate could lead to potentially high multiples/valuations when it comes to the LPs/Growers? Occam's Razor dictates that we see a highly regulated climate with provincially controlled stores and prepackaged products; I see this being the perfect storm for LPs to capture higher market shares/net margins. From a security analysis standpoint, I see plenty of catalysts for higher valuations/net multiples; also see plenty of margin of safety as well (even if they only do medicinal sales).

* Funny enough, Georgia Dept of Ag is now [unable to publish a price for this week](https://google.com/#q=www.wsj.com/articles/chicken-price-report-halted-amid-scrutiny-1480528304) due to lack of participation (out of 11 possible submitters).

Short version is below for anyone that doesn't want to read more than two pages

**Bebe Stores (NASDAQ:BEBE) Writeup (11/30/2016)**

I am long shares of BEBE at $0.53 per share. At this price, BEBE has a market capitalization of $42.7mn. With no debt and $47.3mn of cash on the balance sheet, BEBE has an enterprise value of negative $4.6mn. Bebe is trading at 0.4x tangible book value of $121.2mn. I think this is an attractive entry point with high margin of safety for an ""iconic"" brand that should generate more than $300mn of revenue this year. 

**Introduction** 

Bebe Stores (""Bebe"" or the ""Company"") is a mall-based and online retailer of ""unique, sophisticated, and timelessly sexy"" contemporary women's apparel and accessories (e.g. separates, tops, dresses, active wear, handbags, and shoes). The average Bebe customer is 32 year old (ranges from low 20s to high 40s) and is college-educated, working, single, and has no children. The Company currently operates 182 retail stores, including 143 retail stores and 38 outlet stores, and has 82 international licensees operating stores in 23 countries. Bebe was founded in 1976 by Manny Mashouf (CEO and Chairman of the Board) and is headquartered in Brisbane, CA. 

From its founding in 1976 until the 2008-2009 recession, Bebe was a fast-growing and profitable specialty retailer. Since then, it has been a turnaround story with lots of C-suite turnover (four different CEOs). The stock is down 90%+ over the last 5/10 years. After a tough 2009-2010, Bebe saw solid performance in 2011-2012. Then a lot of damage was done when Manny stepped down as CEO and hired Steve Birkhold to run the Company in early 2013. Under Steve's leadership, Bebe made a number of questionable operational choices that confused and/or alienated the core Bebe customer, such as messing with product pricing, investing in marketing campaigns that overemphasized the party lifestyle (e.g. Bebe is for young 20-year old party girls that live a ""9pm to 5pm"" lifestyle), and organizing store layouts by color palette not by type. 

The substantial decline in share price was enough to get activist fund Prentice Capital Management (5.47% current ownership) involved in March 2016. Prentice filed a 13D and sent three letters to the Company's Board There was a long period of silence until Prentice filed a 13G six months later the day after the Company reported Q1 2017 results), which superseded its 13D filing. What happened in those six months / what did Prentice learn / did they just give up? Lloyd Miller filed a 13G with 5.46% ownership on the previous day.

**Thesis #1: Valuation is attractive** 

Bebe is an ""iconic"" brand, and the Company generated $384.5mn of revenue in the last 12 months and should generate more than $300mn this year. With a market capitalization of $42.7mn and $47.3mn of cash, Bebe has an enterprise value of negative $4.6mn. The Company is trading at 0.4x tangible book value of $121.2mn; even if tangible book value was cut in half, Bebe would still trade under 1.0x. The market is essentially saying Bebe is not worth the cash, let alone the assets at cost, on its balance sheet, which I think I don't think is the case. 

Why does this opportunity exist? Performance has been terrible, and the market is not assigning any turnaround value to the founder coming back as CEO or the JV transaction with Bluestar Alliance. There are also not many natural shareholders of Bebe. It's microcap stock with a share price under $1, is not part of any major indices (dropped from the Russell 2000 and 3000 in June 2016), no longer pays a dividend, no longer has any major sell-side coverage, and stopped doing earnings calls / hasn't presented at industry investor conference in a long time.

What is Bebe worth? That's hard to say, but I am betting it's >0. In my base case, I value Bebe at $1.40 per share (150% upside), which includes $0.59 for cash, $0.37 for real estate at cost, and $0.44 for the Bluestar JV (Bluestar paid $35.1mn for just under 50% ownership, which implies the enterprise value of the JV is $70.2mn). Adding $0.56 for closing the gap between current market capitalization and tangible book value and $0.08 for the NOLs using a 50% discount rate ($169.2mn of federal NOLs are unlikely to be used in the foreseeable future, but they are worth something / long-term upside), you get a share price of $2.04 (almost 300% upside). If the Company completely turns it around, that's an even greater multiple of where we are today. 

**Thesis #2: Manny is back (again) and is taking action to finally turnaround Bebe** 

In February 2016, Manny returned as CEO for the third time, and the Company has historically performed well under his leadership as CEO. He currently owns 58.14% of the stock, which has decreased in value from over $1bn prior to the downturn to ~$25mn currently. Manny is now 78 years old; he can't run the Company forever. 

In June 2015, Manny filed to sell his shares in a secondary offering at $2.47 per share (the registration statement was withdrawn two months later after the stock had decreased another 45%). Manny won’t be able to unload his position at the current price; he probably doesn’t want to sell now either. Unless performance drastically improves and a secondary is possible again, I think Bebe is ultimately taken private. While Manny has rebuffed recent acquirer interest, I think he is a seller (he was at $2.47), but wants to show a performance bump first. 

While profitability and cash flow have suffered over the last four years, the Company is now focused on rightsizing the cost structure and store base, not growing sales. Per the Q1 2017 10Q: ""Our strategic focus for the remainder of fiscal 2017 is to close unprofitable stores or negotiate rent reductions for stores with kickout rights or where the store lease is up for renewal. In addition, we continue to limit the size of the investment in inventory and capital expenditures."" Bebe cut over 80 heads and closed 21 stores in FY 2016 and plans to close up to 24 stores in FY 2017 (no plans to open any new stores this year). The Company is negotiating lease renewals on 35 stores in FY 2017, so there is potential to cleanly roll off underperforming stores if they are unable to negotiate rent reductions. Management is projecting a flat cash balance in FY 2017 vs. prior year.

**Thesis #3: International wholesale upside** 

In Q4 of FY 2016, Bebe entered into a joint venture with Bluestar Alliance to develop wholesale domestic and international licensing business. Bebe contributed its IP assets for 50.0000000001% ownership in the JV, and Bluestar contributed $35.1mn of cash ($35mn of which was paid to Bebe) in exchange for the remaining ownership in the JV. That values the JV at $70.2mn, which is well above the Company's market capitalization, so there is a lot of upside here. The purpose of the JV is to develop a wholesale domestic and international licensing business for the Bebe brand. Bluestar will manage the day to day operations of the JV. Bebe retained a royalty-free, perpetual license to use the Bebe IP in the US and Canada (i.e. to continue its existing retail store and e-commerce businesses). Bluestar is a brand management specializing in purchasing consumer brand companies and converting target operations onto brand licensing entities. It acquires successful as well as distressed companies. Since its inception in 2006, Bluestar has acquired select brands with current retail sales exceeding $1.5bn. Its current portfolio of brands manages over 200 licensees who distribute product globally. 

**Downside** 

The main downside is the obvious one: The turnaround doesn't materialize and Bebe continues burning cash.

**Catalysts** 

1. Quarterly improvement in same store sales and profitability (Q1 2017 was good) 
2. Capital structure improvement, such as finding a bank to provide a revolving credit facility, doing a sale-leaseback of the distribution center and/or design studio, or selling the two condos in LA 
3. Strategic alternatives (Manny is getting old, there are a lot of willing buyers) 
4. Cash starts to flow in from the wholesale licensing JV with Bluestar as new licensees are added 
5. CFO with solid retail experience is hired

t3_5j9cyi,"""The word is Herald."" A look back to close the loop on an unexpected 2011 Buffett purchase that did not make sense at the time.","Here's the relevant time stamp from a CNBC video from the time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fUhJnXtcm4#t=6m14s

The word is Herald. Omaha World-Herald, one of a group of 63 midwest newspaper companies purchased off of Media General. Berkshire paid $142 million cash and loaned Media General (the part of the company that was left, that wasn't acquired by BRK) ~450 million at 10.5% interest. Just two years earlier Buffett told his shareholders: “for most newspapers in the United States, we would not buy them at any price” because “they have the possibility of going to just unending losses” and he didn't ""see anything on the horizon that causes that erosion to end."" The investment got scrutinized at the time, and a lot of people took it as an old man making a sentimental purchase. What we didn't know was that he also got the right to buy 5 million shares in the remaining Media General company for a penny each. Media General today is worth about $20 per share, up from $4 back in 2011. Meaning the warrants alone are worth a little under $100 million (and more than that at times). In addition, the debt loaned to Media General has been paid back, and Berkshire collected interest of 10.5% for years on that loan. Media General also paid another $44m to Berkshire as a condition of a later merger. Another example of profiting off of having liquidity when others do not. The Herald was just a bonus.﻿",40,0.9,1482185648,"[['MDWT', 1]]",MDWT,56.18000030517578,68.0

I find his definition interesting but haven't found how to calculate it yet. He believes, at least it's my understanding that he believes, the least it should equal is 2% of Single-Family Mortgage assets (approximately $60 B).

Assuming warrants are canceled and senior preferred shares are wiped, Fannie Mae could produce a $20 share price assuming a $100b market cap. for the company. The historical average PE Ratio for Fannie Mae has been 10. The company produced $11b of earnings in 2015. Some could legitimately argue that those earnings were inflated by $3b based on suspended dividend payments to the preferreds.

The valuation of the GSE's are highly dependent upon the capital requirement that is chosen, among other things. Interested in what others have to say and if anyone is able to answer my initial question.

t3_5kiklh,[Discussion] Reliq Health Technologies (CVE:RHT),"**Outline:**
RHT is working on an app which connects healthcare professionals and patients, along with the patient's circle of care (i.e. family, friends, anybody able to assist in outpatient care). Their aim is to provide automated monitoring of patients through proximity sensors and wearable biometric devices, and to facilitate communication within the circle of care.

**Pros**

+ There are three already established pilots (Florida, LA, UK), and one white-label contract (to the estimated value of $1.2M; San Antonio, TX) commencing February 2017.

+ The company's and NHS' (UK) aims with regard to treatment are highly aligned, accordingly the NHS has expressed considerable interest in RHT.

+ Progressions towards mHealth (mobile health) incentivized by significant reduction in cost to healthcare systems through ease of administration.

+ Patient outcomes improved through more efficient health monitoring, further reduces costs by mitigating such fines as those imposed by e.g. Medicaid for preventable readmissions. 

+ In future RHT will establish Big Data services, providing another source of revenue.

**Cons**

- Liabilities of ~$1.3M, at present the biggest obstacle for RHT appears to be the accrued debt. Their cash runway is projected to last until Q1-2017, at which point the revenue from the aforementioned contract in TX will be their lifeline, unless they also acquire further financing from other sources.

- Currently not profitable, projection for profitability is in 2017. 

- Some degree of trust to overcome with some patients' expressed worry over cybersecurity.


I presently have no shares in RHT, however wanted to post about it here in order to discuss and clarify the viability of the company.

Further Buffet has also stated that Berkshire Hathaway's favorite holding period is forever. My question is; If the goal of investing is to buy something below fair value and sell at fair value, once the market corrects its valuation - What is the rationale for holding forever? Ideally, isn't it better to hold stocks for only as long as they take to move to fair value. Further from an IRR standpoint don't you want to hold stocks for as small a time period as possible because of the compounding?

t3_5nd9up,Interesting Investment Ideas,"Hey guys,
with the market reaching ATH after ATH mostly through multiple expansion, it gets harder and harder to find great investments that can produce returns of 8-10% ++. That`s why I would like to start a thread about your best Investment ideas at the moment. 

Here is the most attractively priced Company on my watchlist atm:
United Internet. You might not know this company as it´s a german mid cap but I'm from germany and am fairly familiar with it. They provide E-mail and other internet services and also sell DSL Internet to consumers and businesses.
They also did a JV with Warburg Pincus recently to do larger M&A Deals ( recently Strato). Uniteds founder and CEO Ralph Dommermuth owns about 40% of the company and he is thinking long term. Because of his long term ownership Exec and director comp is fair and not too high. The valuation is pretty cheap at around 15x forward FCF if you take into account that this is a fast growing (around 10%) company with low Capex requirements and very high returns on invested capital. Debt is modest, especially with euro interest rates ( thanks mario ). Their recent stock investments in Rocket Internet and Telecolumbus haven`t done very well but they are about 200m each ( 1€ per share) and could turn around, but even If they do not , this company is still very cheap. I think United Internet is a high growing, high ROIC company trading at a very attractive valuation. I think returns of more than 8% are easily doable and US investors also have the super strong $ to take advantage of. Definitly worth further research.

That was my best Idea atm, I looking forward to hear yours! :)",10,0.86,1484153821,"[['DSL', 1], ['FCF', 1], ['ROIC', 1]]",DSL,19.059999465942383,19.290000915527344

t3_5odd7b,Calculating Enterprise Value on a business that heavily utilizes Joint Ventures,"Hi all,

Trying to wrap my head around the correct way to get to EV for Adeptus Health (ADPT).  Appreciate the insight of anyone with a deeper understanding or experience with this.

Here's my current formula (millions), numbers rounded: 

Market cap: 233.7
(+) Debt: 160.4
(+) Noncontrolling interest: 85.1
(+) Preferred stock: 21.9
(-) Cash: 28
(-) Equity investments in affiliates: 265.1
(=) Enterprise Value: 208.0

Preferred and cash are tricky because the company raised about 21.9m from private equity sponsor and other shareholders in November according to the Q316 10Q (pg.49), with the reasons cited for the raise being general working capital needs and payroll.  For simplicities sake, I've assumed that basically all of this capital raised has gone to cash on the BS, and that this cash has not yet been tapped into (for lack of better data).  Therefore, cash is equal to 6.1 that was present on the BS per 10Q plus ~21.9 raised from preferred offering in November.  So this represents by first ""black hole"" of confusion.

My second source of confusion relates to the JVs.  As I understand it, you want to adds noncontrolling interest to EV (JVs where ADPT owns greater than 50%) but subtract any equity investments in affiliates (JVs where ADPT owns less than 50%).  In the formula above, I've simply pulled both from the BS.

Final source of confusion relates to a tax receviable agreement entered into at the time of IPO that entitles the pre-IPO owners (PE firms) to I think 85% of any tax benefit received by the company.  This is equal to 237.9m (close to the market cap of the company).  In the formula above I've excluded this because I have yet to determine how to go about it.  However, as you can tell, subtracting this amount from the enterprise value results in a negative EV.

Appreciate thoughts.  Also if anyone is interested, LTM adjusted EBITDA of this business is 75m per most recent 10Q.  If my math is correct that implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 2.77x.  The only problem is that I am not yet confident of my math at this point.  Thanks! ",5,0.66,1484599735,"[['ADPT', 2]]",ADPT,36.209999084472656,40.619998931884766

t3_5oyg6r,How do you go about building detailed operating models with limited info?,"Say you're an ordinary individual investor with access just to company filings, equity research notes and basic industry data. How do you build a detailed integrated three statement model, in particular with an bottom-up, granular revenue and cost model within the income statement. (Without calling and asking an analyst to send you his/her model).

Context: 3rd yr analyst in M&A at a BB aiming to break in to the buy side. A lot of places require this kind of modeling test (e.g CD&R give you 7 hours and an old laptop with a stack of 10ks and 5 broker reports to build a 3 statement model, dcf, lbo, comps etc). The valuation approach for me is relatively straightforward, but without knowing a company or industry extremely well I find it difficult to understand how an investor can forecast volume, price/mix, fx by operating segment and geography and have a fair knowledge of the split of cogs by type and split of sg&a by type, the drivers etc. In banking, we are often either given private company info, or detailed due diligence reports from consultants and the big 4s that allow us to build a sensible operating model. A 10k offers very little outside segmental revenues and operating income (sometimes!).

Any recommended resources on this? Books/websites/ paid resources? I'm sure it's often sector specific but any suggestions would be appreciated.

Macabus and other sites I've used are great from a macro perspective but don't offer the granularity that many firms require from prospective new joiners. I'm currently using WSO PE and HF resources and BIWS case studies to practice. Happy to share my thoughts on both but overall I think they're too US focused and should offer an IFrS equivalent! Also on IB for those that may be thinking about it - I would say your exposure to actually building this kind of detailed operating model can be quite limited - and your often stuck with using the company's business plan and flexing upside and downside cases. Not what I'd hoped to be doing!

t3_5uvbhg,Alliance Resource (ARLP) - Deserves a closer look,"Alliance Resource is a marketer and producer of coal that supplies to United States utilities and industrial users.  ARLP is the nation’s first publicly traded master limited partnership involved in the production of coal.  It currently is the second largest producer in the Eastern United States, operating ten mines.  The company’s mines are located in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia.  

    Third quarter earnings of $.91 per unit beat the consensus estimate by $.18.  Alliance Resources also beat expectations during the second quarter; this trend is expected to continue.  Two factors are benefiting ARLP: a) lower costs and b) stronger than expected demand for thermal coal.  Note that two types of coal exist, metallurgical and thermal.  Metallurgical coal is used for steel making and thermal, which ARLP produces, is used for electricity generation.  Demand has likely increased because of a) increased natural gas prices (natural gas is competition for coal) and b) healthier demand for thermal coal from overseas. 

    Increased commodity prices will certainly help boosts profits for coal, but given that most of the sales are derived from long-term contracts, we won’t see any benefit from improving pricing until next year.  

    I’d regard the management team as exemplary.  Primarily, management closed four high-cost mines, most recently Pattiki (in Carmi, Illinois), over the past year.  Management moved output from these high-cost mines to lower cost mines such as Hamilton. 

    ARLPs units are trading on the lower end of their historical valuation range on both a price to book and price to cash flow basis.  Units haven’t traded this low on a price to cash flow basis since 2010.  Also, the dividend (currently 7.40%) was recently cut back, with the savings going to paying down debt.  The dividend may be cut further if a) coal prices decrease or b) demand weakens. 

    While the current ratio, coming in at .74, may suggest that Alliance Resources lacks sufficient liquidity, this is supported by a $480 million revolving credit facility of senior secured financing, maturing in May of 2019.  If the company needs liquidity, they can draw upon this money just as one would do with a credit card.  ARLP does not incur any debt until they draw on it.  Revolvers are great to provide liquidity/availability if a working capital drain eats up cash flow and the company needs cash.  Alliance Resources can also fund acquisitions under its revolver, then choose to term out heavy revolver draws once they are too drawn.

    Margins are holding up reasonably well and can improve if coal prices pick up because the mines are currently running well below full capacity.  Price to book ratio is 1.7.  Price to sales = 0.9    price to cash flow = 2.5    debt to equity = .2   Interest coverage = 8.81   Operating margin = 35%   Net profit margin = 16.9%   10 yr average return on partners capital and return on capital, respectively = 54.19% and 29.59%. 
Total debt = $773.5 million (also due in 5 years).  Long term debt = $237.3 million and Long term interest of $30 million.  $21.4 million in cash, $278.3 million =current assets, $691.8 million = current liabilities.  Price to owner earnings = 4.05 (min 2.08, max 30.09). Earnings yield 8.23% and dividend yield 7.40%. EV/EBITDA = 3.9 and EBITDA per share = $8.13. 

    I arrive at an intrinsic value of $88.15 per unit based on DCF analysis (FCF based), using a 12% discount rate.

I am reading McCormick Annual Report (2015), and I came across something that I could not get right. 

Basically, in page 69, section **17. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATA**, under **Other long-term liabilities**, Pension (which I assumed to be Net Pension Obligation), stood at $192.8 for the year 2015. Fair enough.

So I went back to page 61, **10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND RETIREMENT PLANS**, and got the Funded Status for year 2015. I'll summarise the results below.

|                                          | United State | International |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Benefit obligation at end of year        | $ 722.0      | $308.1        |
| Fair value of plan assets at end of year | $ 548.6      | $288.3        |
| Funded status                            | $(173.4)     | $ (19.8)      |

Adding the results up leads to a missing shortfall of $0.4 

    (173.4 + 19.8 = 193.2)
    (193.2 - 192.8 = 0.4)

So I was wondering where could the difference be? And the gap is even wider for the year 2014, so I doubt it could be simply attributed to currency difference, but I could be wrong.

Case in point, AMD's 2016 10-K, page 42. Here's the relevant section: http://imgur.com/MyAqYzJ

You can download the full document here: http://ir.amd.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=74093&p=irol-sec

Purchase obligations, including obligations to Globalfoundries (their wafer supply partner), are a total of $3.7 bln. These are the minimum, non-cancellable amounts. This is obviously quite significant, as it comprises over 50% of total long-term contractual commitments, and can potentially have a huge impact on the company's valuation.

On one hand, I think they should be included, as these represent real cash outflows that will not go towards equity holders.

On the other hand, since they are payments to suppliers, presumably they would be reflected in future COGS. Therefore, as long as future COGS are above this floor set by minimum purchase obligations, there is no need to capitalize them. Basically, if I were to do a DCF, and I projected higher COGS than these numbers, there would be no need to adjust for them. At the moment, I'm leaning towards this.

The worst part was the conference calls, the worst time was when we had to sit through 5 of them over the course of a month before we even saw a price sheet.

At a certain point, we said, “Enough is enough.” We were developers, we had studied and worked in the finance space, “This should be easy we thought.” It wasn’t, but in the end, every roadblock that popped up in our way only gave us more motivation to succeed.

**The Product:**

Thus after a year of hard work, we finally feel that our product, [Trade Defender](https://www.tradedefender.com) is ready to launch. Our goal was to make our pricing transparent, and our customers’ lives easier.

t3_5z1awe,Any users here proficient in the BACKTEST function in Bloomberg terminal? Better functions than Backtest?,I am attempting to create a scale in strategy to back test. I am limited by the factors I can include when creating the strategy. The strategy uses the 2 day RSI and 200 day moving average to determine when to enter and exit the position. The first entry is 10% of total desired position and then scales in an additional 20% if the closing price is lower than the initial entry price any day the position is held. This scale in can potential happen two more times with the 3rd position being 30% and the fourth position is 40% if the closing price is less than the last entry price at any time. I am not having issues with the initial entry or exit rules but rather the scale in scenarios that could occur. The issue is that I cannot set a factor based on time – for example the RSI is below 25 for 2 DAYS. Additionally I cannot figure out how to enter with 10% of total position initially and then 20% of total position for the next entry. The last issue is that there is no factor that allows me to set a rule based on the last entry price. Any advice would be helpful. Maybe I should not be using the BACKTEST function but rather a different Function? ,5,0.73,1489356564,"[['RSI', 2]]",RSI,9.789999961853027,10.0
t3_5zjx0m,Eagle Bulk Shipping [EGLE] long investment thesis,"Hi everyone,

Here is a stock pitch I've been working on over the past month or so. I have submitted the long version of this post to some value investing firms since after 4 years of reading about investing and trying it on my own, I've decided this is something I want to do seriously and as a career. I know I've seen some posts on here about the shipping industry and how everyone is basically taking their capital from that industry so that's what sparked my interest. Anyways the crux of this thesis is basically who can bleed the longest before things get better in the dry bulk shipping industry. This was a pretty tough one since its a commodity business and really there is no differentiation besides good management. Any counter arguments and critiques are welcome and encouraged. So anyway here's the thesis.

Thesis:

I place a target price for Eagle Bulk Shipping in a range between $ 6.55 - $8.78 per share based on it's Net Asset Value per share (NAV). Currently it is at $ 5.59. This represents a 17 % - 57 % upside based on its vessel values being worth 50 % -60 % of what book value states and an additional 50 % - 100% shares issued through private placement.

Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc is dry bulk shipping company that specializes in owning Suprmax dry bulk vessels which transport commodity products such as coal, ore, petcoke, and grain. The average age of the fleet is 8.6 years as of September 2016.  Supramax vessels have the additional flexibility of onboard cranes which allow ease of loading and unloading cargo, unlike other vessel types such as the Panamax which require port facilities to load and unload their cargoes. 

Eagle Bulk Shipping is trading at multiples of current ratio of 4.99, debt to equity ratio of .46, and cash to interest ratio of 6.5. This is compared to the average current ratio of 3.88, average debt to equity of .69 and average cash to interest expense of 4.10. The peer group is composed of 5 other different dry bulk shipping companies: Golden Ocean (GOGL), Scorpio Bulkers Inc (SALT), Navios Maritime Partners L.P. (NMM), Diana Shipping (DSX), and Safe Bulkers Inc (SB). 

The Dry Bulk Shipping market is currently depressed due to an oversupply of ships built and ordered back in 2008 because of China’s fast growing economy. As a result of China’s economy slowing and a surplus of ships, vessel values have decreased. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI), a daily average of charter rates, reached an all time low of 290 in February 2016. As a result, Eagle Bulk Shipping is trading at base case Price to NAV multiple of .84 which is the lowest in its peer group. Eagle Bulk Shipping has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and new management yet is trading at a bigger discount to its NAV then its peers. 

The stock is mispriced for the following reason:

1.	In a worst case scenario if vessels are written down to 40 % - 50 % of their book value and shares are increased by 80 % - 100 % over the next 6 – 18 months, NAV per share can range from   $ 3.24 - $ 5.46 per share which results in a – 41 % to – 1 % downside. 

2.	The base case assumes the vessels are valued between 40 % - 60% of book value and total shares issued only increase 20 % - 50 % over the next 6 – 18 months. In this case, NAV per share will fall in between $ 6.55 - $ 10.97 giving an 18 % - 98 % upside. 

3.	In a best case scenario, shares outstanding will remain the same or an extra 20% are issued over the next 6 – 18 months.  Assuming vessels are at 50 % - 60 % of book value, NAV can range from      $ 8.19 - $ 13.17 per share which offers a 48 % - 138 % upside. 

In all three cases, I am assuming they do not use excess cash to pay off any debt for the next 6 -18 months. Realistically, Eagle Bulk Shipping is obligated to pay 75 % of excess cash flow June 2017 and December 2017. 

Catalysts in the next 6 – 18 months include:

1.	The Ballast Water Management Convention coming into force September 2017

2.	The Orderbook on new ships built is at a 10 year low

The Ballast Water Management Convention is designed to help prevent the spread of aquatic organisms when ships travel between ports. Most ships will need to install on-board systems to help treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Management will have to determine if it is economically feasible to continue running older ships, who may only have 5-7 years left, with new equipment or scrap the older vessels.
 
Ships older than 16 years represent approximately 14% of the total fleet tonnage which if scrapped due to the new Ballast Water Management Convention will greatly increase charter rates. The second catalyst is dependent on new ships being built. With fewer ships out on water, charter rates and NAV would increase. At the end of 2016, new ships Dwt are only 10% of existing fleet which is a 10 year low. 
 
With such a low amount of new ships being ordered, supply and demand could return charter rates to profitable levels again which would benefit Eagle Bulk Shipping since its break even cost on charter rates is second lowest among its peer group.
 
The most relevant investment risks for Eagle Bulk Shipping include:

1.	Global economy slows down which will further depress vessel values and charter rates

2.	Stockholder dilution through private placement of more stock

3.	Dry Bulk Shipping companies may preemptively order new ships built in anticipation of the cycle turning which would further depress vessel values

4.	Defaulting on debt 

If the global economy, specifically big coal and iron ore importers like China and India, slows down, then there would be an additional headwind contributing to demand the dry bulk shipping industry would face. The prolonged depression in charter rates could lead to a possible chain reaction of different risks playing out. The low charter rates could cause Eagle Bulk Shipping to offer more shares in private placements to maintain liquidity and current shareholders would be diluted. Now, if the company cannot successfully raise more capital due to a slowing economy then they may default on their first lien debt. On a similar note, it’s second lien debt is very expensive and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 14.00% per annum (with a 1.0% LIBOR floor) or the Base Rate (as defined in the Second Lien Loan Agreement) plus 13.00% per annum, paid in kind quarterly in arrears. Even though the company only has to pay excess cash flow for its semi-annual debt payments (which could be $ 0 in a best case scenario and would not pose a problem for liquidity), the bigger concern would be that the dry bulk shipping industry does not improve in the next 12 – 24 months. The Ballast Management Water Convention set to be in full effect September 2017 may have no impact on ship scrapping and charter rates may remain the same. Lastly, one of the biggest risk factors is undisciplined management in the dry bulk shipping industry. Back in 2013 – 2014 ship owners began to preemptively order new ships in anticipation of a reversal in market conditions. This feedback loop caused prices in charter rate to dip again which decreased the order book for 2015. It is likely that such a feedback loop could play out again before charter rates reach profitable levels. This lack of discipline also resulted in an over ordering of ships back in 2008 which began the drop in the dry bulk shipping industry.

However, I've noticed they sometimes report negative wacc. For example, look at KOSS Jun 2014 (annual), WACC is reported as negative. 

I don't understand how they are getting this as it must be an error. Fwiw, the market value of equity is obviously positive, as is the book value of equity so no issue in errors resulting from use of book value of equity (not that it should be used anyways). They use book value of debt in their calculation. They use market risk premium at a constant of 7.5% in CAPM to determine cost of equity. 

Their explanation of their calculation can be found at the following link (pretty standard but omits preferred stock and calculates cost of debt via interest expense as a proportion of 2 yr avg of debt level):

t3_62y39p,Outstanding Shares after an IPO,"A company that's going to list on the ASX through an IPO has caught my eye because of their products, and I'm not entirely sure how to deal with options relating to the offer when making a model. The following is information from the prospectus:  
Shares issued under the offer = 25.5m  
Shares issued pursuant to the ""Exchange Agreement"" = 100m  
**Total shares on completion of offer = 125.5m**  
Options issued under the offer = 25.5m (1 option for each issued share, which is exercisable if the stock price increases 10% in 2 years)  
Options issued to directors and management = 11.4m (exerciseable if stock price increases 50% in 3 years)  
Options issued to Joint Lead Managers = 10m (exercisable if the stock price increases 10% in 3 years)  
**Total options on completion of offer = 46.9m**  
**Performance shares issued = 45m** (3 different types, based on certain milestones).

My question is that if we assume that all options are exercised and performance shares converted to shares, does that leave total shares outstanding of 217.4m (125.5m + 46.9m + 45m)? So there's a ton of dilution occurring? My understanding at the moment is that the company will issue 25.5m shares to the public, keep 100m as insider shares, and any options/performance shares will add more pieces to the pie.

t3_63rdvt,Need some help with a valuation spreadsheet,"Hi, 

I'm using Valuation by McKinsey to polish up on my valuation skills, and I'm trying to wrap my head around how they organize their spreadsheet. The excerpt I'm confused about is posted below: 

>COMPONENTS OF A GOOD MODEL

>If you combine 15 years of financial forecasts with 10 years of historical analysis,
any valuation spreadsheet becomes complex. Therefore, you need to design
and structure your model before starting to forecast. Many designs are possible.
In our example (see Exhibit 11.1), the spreadsheet contains seven worksheets:

>1. Raw historical data: Collect raw data from the company’s financial statements,
footnotes, and external reports in one place. By keeping the datatogether, you can verify information as needed and update data year by
year. Report the raw data in their original form.

>2. Integrated financial statements: Using figures from the raw-data worksheet,
create a set of historical financials that find the right level of
detail. As a general rule, operating and nonoperating items should not
be aggregated within the same line item. The income statement should
be linked with the balance sheet through retained earnings. This worksheet
will contain historical and forecast financial statements.

>3. Historical analysis and forecast ratios: For each line item in the financial
statements, build historical ratios, as well as forecasts of future ratios.
These ratios will generate the forecast financial statements contained on
the previous sheet.

>4. Market data and weighted average cost of capital (WACC): Collect all
financial market data on one worksheet. This worksheet will contain
estimates of beta, the cost of equity, the cost of debt, and the weighted
average cost of capital, as well as historical market values and trading
multiples for the company.

>5. Reorganized financial statements: Once you have built a complete set of
financial statements (both historical and forecast), reorganize the financial
statements to calculate NOPLAT, its reconciliation to net income,
invested capital, and its reconciliation to total funds invested.
>6. ROIC and FCF: Use the reorganized financials to build return on invested
capital, economic profit, and free cash flow. Future free cash flow will be
the basis of your valuation.

>7. Valuation summary: This worksheet presents discounted cash flows, discounted
economic profits, and final results. The valuation summary
includes the value of operations, value of nonoperating assets, value of
nonequity claims, and resulting equity value.  

I'm currently on Step 2. Here's where I'm confused. First, do I reorganize the raw data to separate operating/non-operating items, as well as debt/equity in the second spreadsheet? Then do I have to reorganize the data again to calculate NOPLAT in Step 5? If this is the case, how to I find the right level of detail to reorganize the statements in this step? At this point, should I be making other worksheets to detail operating lease commitments, options, debt schedules, etc? This seems like it would be the most tedious step, so is there anything I should be doing to keep things organized? 

Second question - it says that the worksheet in Step 2 should contain historical and forecast financial statements. But previously it says information should flow down the spreadsheets, not up. And in order to forecast financials, I need to calculate the ratios in Step 3 first. So the information flow would end up going Raw Data --> Integrated Financials --> Historical Analysis and Forecast Ratios --> Integrated Financials. Is this correct?

t3_66593r,need online broker recommendations for $5M+ account,"Hi guys, I'm not really sure where to find this (without just default to using Interactive Brokers), so I was hoping to pick someone's brain on here.

My current employer (a small insurance company) is giving me a small book of my own to manage, starting with $5M and the potential to bump up to $10M and more, depending on my performance (and if the market goes down, they’ll allocate more to me). Basically, this money would be wired into a managed account under one of the subsidiaries of the insurance company, with me managing it directly.

Given that they are an insurance company, most of the $1.5B+ in assets is invested in bonds for regulatory reasons, and they are pretty heavy in trading bonds, primarily high quality corporate, municipal, government, etc.

However, I'm about to be their first equity/special situations/distressed focused guy. They have asked me to decide on which broker I would like to use. This is really out of my wheelhouse, as far who would be best broker to use.

My personal experience from trading my PA for the past 10+ years is TD Ameritrade. I don’t think they would be a good option for an institutional size account like $5M.

The following would be the requirements for the account:

- the account would need to be tied in with the insurance company’s existing accounting/tax people, so that my returns can be tracked (for the purpose of helping me build a track record that I can market to investors in the future)
- should hopefully have an easy online interface. I will have a Bloomberg Terminal for research purposes, but I will likely place trades from my Mac.
- need margin and full options capabilities because I will be shorting, mostly to hedge
- international access preferable, although not a big thing here since I will mostly be US focused, as well as Europe and probably Japan
- focus will be on small and mid cap special situations, mostly equities, followed by debt and sometimes hybrid securities like preferred stock and things like warrants, CVR’s, credit default swaps, etc.

I have experience with the regular hedge fund prime brokers (Jefferies, Wells Fargo, etc.), but this setup is too small for them I believe; I’d never meet their minimum revenue requirements. I doubt any of them will take me on for $5M alone.

I’ve heard Interactive Brokers being throw around, but their website is horrible (I wired in money into a PA there once, and then pulled it all out 1 day later because I couldn’t stand it - I’ve also heard their customer service is bad). I don’t know if I could handle IB for this purpose. I’ve also heard horror stories about their margin policies, as far as raising margin requirements overnight and if you don’t make changes to your portfolio immediately, .

Would some kind of discount broker like Ameritrade or Scotttrade or Fidelity be able to take on an account like this for an insurance company? I’m assuming we should be able to negotiate margin rates, but I doubt anyone can beat a real prime broker or even Interactive Brokers.

Is it worth talking to a mini-prime broker like Weeden or BTIG? would that be the best option? Or should I try contacting one of the online discount brokers like TD Ameritrade and see what they could offer for a $5M+ account?",2,0.58,1492545298,"[['TD', 2]]",TD,48.709999084472656,49.290000915527344
t3_66acsw,Berkshire Hathaway is Undervalued,"I posted this on my [blog](http://www.slowappreciation.com/blog/2017/4/16/berkshire-hathaway-brkb), and figure some here might find it worth a discussion.

**INTRODUCTION**

Berkshire Hathaway is a conservatively-run, well-capitalized business, managed by one of the greatest CEOs of all time. It uses minimal leverage, operates across many recession-resilient industries, and has grown earnings 20% per year since 1999. Businesses like this rarely trade for less than 20x earnings. Berkshire Hathaway trades for 7x.

While the company is best known for being a collection of “Warren Buffett’s stock picks”, it now derives a significant—and growing—portion of its value from another source: earnings from the company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. We argue that this latter group—whose earnings exceed those of Amazon, Google, Netflix, Tesla, Twitter, and Uber; combined—is being under-appreciated by the market.

**BUSINESS HISTORY**

In 1964, Warren Buffett took control of a struggling New England textile manufacturer, named Berkshire Hathaway. Its net worth was $22m at the time. Fifty years and $411b later, Berkshire Hathaway is now the fourth largest company in the US, with a reach so wide it makes money nearly every time:

* a plane is flown
* a car is sold
* a house is built 
* goods are transported to/from the West Coast
* an iPhone is purchased
* a lightbulb goes on in Nevada
* someone drinks a Coke
* a french fry is dipped in ketchup
* [and the guy at DQ does this](http://shenzhenphotos.com/images/20101213144523_upside%20down%20blizzard.jpg)

So how did Buffett grow a modest textile company into a sprawling conglomerate—one that now owns dozens of operating companies and a stock portfolio worth $150b?  

In the decades after taking control of Berkshire, Buffett steered the company through three major—and lucrative—shifts. He began in the late 1960s by acquiring insurance companies. Then he started using the insurance premiums generated by their operations to buy shares of publicly traded companies. Finally, in the 1990s, he began buying large businesses outright. 

**Phase I**: Buying Insurance Companies to Generate Float

The first step took place in 1967, when Berkshire purchased a small Nebraskan insurance company called National Indemnity for $8.6m. Buffett was drawn to characteristics unique to the insurance business: cash—in the form of premiums—is collected years before claims are paid out. In the meantime, the insurance company is free to invest it. This money is commonly referred to as “float”. Buffett explains further:

“Float is money we hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the money. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay. That leaves it running an ‘underwriting loss’, which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.”

In other words: for most insurers, the combined cost of running their business and paying out claims usually exceeds the money they receive from premiums. Most insurers make up for these underwriting losses by profitably investing their float. If they just so happen to earn an underwriting profit—that is, if premiums ultimately exceed the cost of running the business plus the cost of claims—it’s simply a bonus. 

Unlike most insurers, Berkshire consistently earns an underwriting profit. So not only does Berkshire get to invest the float, but it’s effectively paid to do so! Buffett says, “That’s like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay you interest.” 

An insurer that consistently generates float and earns an underwriting profit is a great business. Still, Buffett saw more potential. Instead of investing the float in conservative and low-yielding bonds like a traditional insurance company does, Buffett took a new approach: he used the float to buy stock in other companies selling for reasonable prices.

**Phase II**: Using Float to Buy Partial Ownership of Other Companies (i.e., Stocks)

Throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, Buffett used the proceeds from Berkshire’s insurance businesses to buy shares of a number of fantastic companies—such as Coca Cola, American Express, and The Washington Post—which were at the time selling for far less than their intrinsic values. By investing the borrowed money (i.e., float) that Berkshire was in effect being paid to hold, Buffett was able to lever his returns—earning Berkshire and its shareholders 20%+ per year. Even better, this leverage came from owned insurance operations rather than debt—which meant Berkshire reaped all the benefits of leverage without shouldering its traditional downside (such as interest expenses and an increase in risk).

Until the early 1990s, Berkshire Hathaway was in essence a lightly-leveraged, publicly-traded stock portfolio, managed by an unusually prudent investor. But as Berkshire grew in size, it became increasingly difficult to find opportunities in publicly traded companies that were large enough to move the needle. So Buffett changed track for the third time: he began acquiring operating businesses outright.

**Phase III**: Buying Full Ownership of Operating Businesses

hough Buffett did buy a few operating businesses in the 1970s and 1980s, it wasn't until the 1990s that he started doing so in earnest. Present-day Berkshire fully owns dozens of businesses, including: GEICO, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, Dairy Queen, Benjamin Moore Paints, Clayton Homes, and ACME Brick. At first, the collective net worth of these businesses was dwarfed by Berkshire’s investment portfolio. And to this day it is the investment portfolio which remains the focus for most investors. But as Buffett continued to acquire simple, stable businesses that possessed what he deemed favorable long-term competitive advantages, their total value swelled. Today, they make up half of Berkshire’s intrinsic value.

**PRESENT-DAY BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

I. What is the Value of Berkshire’s Investment Portfolio (and Cash & Bonds)?

Included in this half of Berkshire’s value are its cash, bonds, and 5%-15% partial ownership stakes in companies such as American Express, Kraft Heinz, Apple, Coca Cola, IBM, Bank of America, and many others. Valuing Berkshire’s investment portfolio is simple. Since “cash is cash”, and the market prices the stocks and bonds every day, one needs only to look up the price and the number of shares owned by Berkshire to get an approximation of their worth:

[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/ayoXqDS.png)

An investor can then apply a premium or a discount, based on whether current market prices are under or overvalued.  An argument could be made that Berkshire’s stock portfolio warrants a slight premium in light of Buffett’s investing prowess, but for simplicity’s sake we are assigning no premium, and assume the market is pricing each company correctly. 

After summing up available cash, stocks, bonds, and preferred shares, we get $257b worth of investments.

|Book Value|Per B Share
:--:|:--:|:--:                               
Cash|$66.3b|$27
Stocks|$120.5b|$49
Bonds|$23.8b|$10
Preferred/Warrants|$17.3b|$7
Kraft Heinz|$29.6b|$12
**Total**|**$257.5b**|**$105**

On a per share basis, this totals $105, or 64% of Berkshire's current $163/share price. 

II. What is the Value of Berkshire’s Operating Businesses?

The rest of Berkshire’s value comes from its operating businesses. After backing out the $105/share of investments from Berkshire’s current share price ($163), the remainder—or $58/share—is what the market believes the operating businesses are worth. 

[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/KdpdCHX.png)

Since the true value of its investment portfolio is more or less determined by the market, the question of whether or not Berkshire is properly valued at $163/share comes down to this: is $58/share a fair price to pay for Berkshire’s operating businesses? Considering these companies earned $8.56/share (pre-tax) in 2016, we feel that paying $58/share for this group—or 7x earnings—is a bargain.

Let’s break this down. Berkshire’s group of wholly-owned operating businesses has grown20%/yr for nearly two decades, earning $21b ($8.56/share) in 2016. Broadly speaking, its businesses fall into one of five segments: insurance; Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE); Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF); Manufacturing, Services, & Retailing (MSR); and Finance & Financial Products. 

[Berkshire Segment Subsidiaries](http://i.imgur.com/GArlySE.png)

**1. Insurance**

*2016 earnings: $2.1b (10 % of total)
*Companies: GEICO, General Re, National Indemnity, etc. 

Since the purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire’s insurance operations have become the largest and most profitable in the world. They have delivered 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits—a feat unheard of in the industry. 

Aside from unusually consistent earnings, the insurance group provides Berkshire with an even greater benefit discussed earlier: float. At year end 2016, the company’s float—money that Berkshire holds but does not own—stood at over $100b. This free financing is available to Berkshire to acquire more businesses across a range of industries.

**2. Finance and Financial Products**

* 2016 earnings: $2.1b (10% of total)
* Companies: Clayton Homes, XTRA, Marmon, CORT

This is Berkshire’s smallest group, made up of companies that specialize in mobile home manufacturing/financing, furniture rentals, and equipment leasing. 

**3. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE)**

* 2016 earnings: $2.7b (13% of total)
* Companies: NV Energy, MidAmerican Energy, PacifiCorp, etc. 

Berkshire Hathaway Energy is a group of regulated utilities, renewable power sources, and gas pipelines operating in Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Oregon, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Regulators allow these monopolies to exist, in exchange for a limit on how much they can earn. Even with these limits in place, this group of companies provides predictable and recession-proof earnings, with the important added benefit of allowing Berkshire to defer billions of dollars in taxes because of their large capital expenditure needs. 

**4. Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railroad (BNSF)**

* 2016 earnings: $5.7b (27% of total)
* Companies: Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad

Railroads play a vital role within the US economy; they ship goods from point A to point B more efficiently and cheaply than all other forms of transport. And because railroads require massive amounts of capital, land, equipment, and government cooperation, these companies are virtually impossible to duplicate—making disruption by a new competitor extremely unlikely. 

The railroad industry is made up of regional duopolies, with BNSF and Union Pacific controlling the western US. While their earnings are cyclical and highly dependent on the health of the national economy, their long-term returns will almost assuredly be above average. Since acquiring BNSF in 2010 for $30b, the company has already earned a total of $24b, and is now the second largest contributor to Berkshire’s operating profit. Like the BHE group, BNSF requires large amounts of capital investment every year to maintain the infrastructure. And just like BHE, these capital outlays can be used to defer taxes at the parent-level for decades to come. Being able to “pay today’s taxes tomorrow” is another nice little form of float; one that lets Berkshire profitably—and tax-efficiently—reinvest billions of dollars back into both segments. 

Said more simply: owning utilities is not a way to get rich; it’s a way to stay rich. And Berkshire intends on staying rich.

**5. Manufacturing, Services, and Retailing**

* 2016 earnings: $8.5b (40% of total)
* Companies: See’s Candy, Lubrizol, Dairy Queen, Marmon, The Pampered Chef, etc. 

This segment drives the lion’s share of Berkshire’s operating earnings. It is an eclectic collection of businesses, selling everything from Dilly Bars to partial ownership of private jets. As a whole, the group earns very respectable returns on capital—with almost no use of financial leverage. Furniture, ice cream, airplane parts, and underwear may not be the most trendy businesses in the world, but they’re safe, stable, and profitable, with many earning 15%-20%/year. 

Together, these five groups earned $21b last year for Berkshire, or $8.56/share.

|Pre-Tax Earnings|Per B Share
:--:|:--:|:--:                               
Underwriting|$2.1b|$0.86
BHE|$2.7b|$1.10
BNSF|$5.7b|$2.31
MSR|$8.5b|$3.43
Financial Products|$2.1b|$0.85
**Total**|**$21.1b**|**$8.56**

**Are Berkshire’s Operating Businesses Being Fairly Valued by the Market?**

Back to the question: Is $58/share a fair price to pay for Berkshire’s operating businesses? 

For $58/share, investors are getting $8.56 of earnings generated by a group of stable companies that: earn solid returns on capital; have been vetted by an investor widely recognized as the greatest of all time; have grown earnings at 20%/yr since 1999; are unlikely to be disrupted by technological advances; and have long-term competitive advantages. 

A standalone company with similar characteristics would probably trade above $170/share. Yet Berkshire’s operating business group trades for only $58. Perhaps if Berkshire renamed this part of their business Berkshire Hathaway AI Biotech Cloud Data Inc., it would it start trading at a more appropriate level. To put this in perspective, let’s imagine that certain popular tech companies started trading at a similar multiple to Berkshire’s operating businesses. Google’s share price would be $245 (versus actual $823); Netflix’s would be $4.50 (versus actual $142); and Amazon’s would be $64 (versus actual $884).

So how many times earnings should an investor be willing to pay for Berkshire’s operating businesses? Each of the five groups has different economic characteristics, so one could apply specific multiples to each (for example, 10x for insurance, 12x for BHE, 15x for BNSF, 15x for MSR, and 10x for Financial Products are probably appropriate). Doing so may yield a more precise (and probably higher) assessment of Berkshire's worth. But with either approach, the message is clear: the market is undervaluing Berkshire.  

We apply a simple—and rather conservative—10x multiple to Berkshire’s group of operating businesses, which yields $85/share in value. When combined with its $105/share of stocks, bonds, and cash, this puts Berkshire’s intrinsic value at somewhere around $190/share—a 15% premium to today’s price.

**Conclusion**

50 years ago, Berkshire Hathaway was a struggling New England textile manufacturer. The business—which required a lot of capital, was barely profitable, and had no long-term competitive advantages—was not a good one. But Warren Buffett decided to buy it anyway, thinking the company’s assets (e.g., machines, factories, accounts receivable, etc.) were worth more than the price he could could pay for the entire business. After assuming control, business steadily deteriorated, and it became apparent the market had been right—Berkshire was a dud. 

Half a century later, Berkshire Hathaway is far from a dud. In fact, it’s probably one of the best companies in the world. While the textile business is long gone, what remains is an investment portfolio worth $105/share, and a collection steadily growing, well managed, and very profitable businesses, that together earned $8.56/share in 2016. A company like that should trade for 20x earnings. Berkshire is available for 1/3rd that.",93,0.93,1492610432,"[['B', 3], ['DQ', 1], ['BHE', 1], ['AI', 1]]",B,50.20000076293945,53.810001373291016

t3_66uuiv,"Kingstone Companies Inc (KINS), a fast growing P&C insurance company","This is my first public post of a security analysis. Any feedback or constructive criticism for improvement on analysis or writing will be highly appreciated. 

Kingstone is an insurance company that has been operating mainly in New York for over 131 years. It has been very profitable in recent years due to the company’s massive restructuring in 2009. The restructuring involved selling most of its underperforming assets and operations as well as acquiring KICO and commencing its operations as a property and casualty insurance company. Earnings have increased almost every year since 2009 and will most likely continue to increase due to Kingstone’s promising future plans for expansion.  

Kingstone plans to expand in two ways:

* Improving A.M. Best rating to A- Excellent
* Expanding sales and operations into neighboring states

**Improving A.M. Best rating to A- Excellent**

**Why focus on a “A” rating?**

With the current B++ rating (one grade below A-), Kingstone cannot be competitive in insuring high valued homes and commercial liability, as the broker agents or client contracts often require an A- rating or better. High valued homes and commercial liability are two lucrative and high-demand markets that will allow Kingstone to continue to grow its sales in existing and future locations. In the event Kingstone’s current clients now require insurance from an A-rated carrier, a higher rating will also ensure higher retention rates.

**How does Kingstone plan to raise their rating?**  

During 2017 Q1, Kingstone issued 2.7M new shares of common stock in a public offering, raising $23M to be used in support of the ratings upgrade plan and anticipated growth (geographic and product expansion). Kingstone relies on quota share reinsurance, an agreement that allows Kingstone to share policy liabilities and premiums with other insurers. The a appropriate level of reliance on reinsurance is one of the factors of A.M. Best’s rating evaluation. As such, Kingstone plans to reduce their reliance on quota share reinsurance, which they believe could lead to a rating upgrade.

On April 12, 2017, A.M. Best announced the upgrade of KICO’s financial strength rating from B++ to A-.  The ratings were “based on the improved risk-adjusted capitalization of KICO, following a $23.0 million capital contribution from KINS on March 1, 2017; improved underwriting results and operating returns in recent years; and increased catastrophe reinsurance coverage.”

**Expanding Sales and Operation into Neighboring States**

Kingstone plans to expand its current New York operation into contiguous states, as the company is licensed to do business in New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Kingstone’s current success is due to providing extraordinary service to small-sized agents who are often disregarded by major insurance companies. In return, the insurance agents place their business with Kingstone as well as provide market and product feedback. Kingstone plans to duplicate its success in neighboring states following the same business approach.

**Analyzing the Numbers**

**P/E**

Kingstone’s current P/E ratio is 13.60, and its 3-year trailing P/E is 17 (current stock price / 3 year average EPS). Because P/E should dictate the desired company’s earnings growth, we would want at least 17% growth for the next few years for the price purchased at today. I am choosing the 3-year trailing, as my margin of safety, as it shows a more consistent view of what the company has been earning and what we are paying for that earning today. Since the 2009 restructuring, Kingstone has had a 7-year average net income growth of 49% and EPS (diluted) growth of 43%, with recent averages still strongly above 17%.

**Diluting Outstanding Shares**

One concern with Kingstone issuing new shares to fund expansion is that it dilutes the EPS, lowering the value of each share for its shareholders. To ensure that Kingstone’s growth plan makes sense, we need to analyze how effective Kingstone has historically been with newly raised capital from issuance of new shares. On December 13, 2013, Kingstone issued 3,450,000 new shares, raising $18,804,000 and increasing their outstanding shares by 90%. The result was that when comparing the averages over the next three years to those of the previous three years, revenue had increased 120%, net income had increased by 301%, and EPS had increased by 137%. Not only had revenue drastically increased, but Kingstone was also able to significantly reduce operating cost to the point where EPS growth exceeded revenue growth.

**How well does Kingstone have to perform?**

In February 2017, Kingstone issued 2.7M new shares, increasing its outstanding shares by 35%. With our required growth rate of 17%, Kingstone will have to increase net income by 142% by the end of the year in order to justify the share dilution from raising new capital.

**Conclusion**

Kingstone is in a prime position to expand and duplicate its success across the Northeast region. Operating in New York, Kingstone was able to obtain its rating upgrade in Q1, which allows the company to enter and become competitive in the high valued homes and commercial liability markets. The main challenge for Kingstone would be to duplicate its success in states outside of New York, which has yet to be proven. The specific focus will be on New Jersey, which according to the U.S. Census Bureau, is the state with the seventh largest property and casualty insurance market in the nation.

t3_671caj,"Firstly, how useful is P/BV for holding companies? Secondly, why are holding companies rarely sum of its parts?","Say Company A is almost exclusively a holding company, i.e. it has limited of its own operations but holds Company B (55%), Company C (62%) and Company D (70%), all of which are listed companies as well. 

Now, the way I understand is, 100% of the assets and liabilities of each of Companies B, C and D will be listed on Company A's balance sheet. Will this not distort the Book Value of Company A? Since, it will not have 100% claims to the assets of the other three companies it holds. Is this the reason why holding companies/conglomerates with diversified listed subsidiaries have low P/BV values? 

Second thing further to the above example. The market value (market cap) of Company A is rarely the sum of the parts of the market value of its holdings in Company B, C and D. When I add 55% of the market cap of B with 62% of the market cap of C and 70% of the market cap of D (discounting the net cash situation of Company A) and compare the sum of the above to the market cap of Company A...there is usually a large difference.

t3_6836rz,Calculating Implied Forward Risk Premium for a Stock using IRR Method (Damodaran Technique). What will this illuminate?,"I know how to calculate an implied equity risk premium for a market using the Damodaran method (which is just an IRR calculation using index value, dividend yield, consensus growth rate for high growth period, and long term T-Bond or zero coupon bond rate for terminal value).

I realize that equity risk premiums for individual stocks are generally based upon the market where the revenues are collected, using risk free rate + weighted average risk premium from different revenue areas.  But I am curious, what if I use the implied equity risk premium (IRR) method on a single stock using current price, dividend yield (including any buybacks), forecast growth rate for high growth period, T-bond rate for terminal growth period and find an implied risk premium for a single issue. What info would this IRR illuminate for me?  Basically, I'm curious as to how I should think about the output in context of an analysis.  

My first impression is that this would be an implied hurdle rate, although I know it's not at all the conventional measure to calculate a hurdle rate. But as an investor shouldn't I check this number and compare it to my assumptions about the company if they can really generate this return over a given period?

EDIT: I forgot to mention, should I be looking for a high implied ERP via this method, which would imply that the stock is relatively low priced. If it beats the CAPM expected return [Risk free*(1-Beta)] shouldn't that be a good signal?

Are there any other metrics by which a comparison to this would be useful? For example, a reverse DCF valuation with conventional cost of equity / capital? I feel like I'm seeing a useful bit of information but can't put it into context.

I looked up $GSAT and came up with these queries for the company, based on its January 2017 presentation. I tweeted the same to the co. but never heard back from them:

Slide #18:
1. How many satellites does your company have? Is it 24 (8 planes x 3 each?)
2. How many of these are 2nd generation satellites?

Slide #19:
3. 2nd generation satellites have a build out cost of $1bn. How long does it take for a custom, 2nd gen statellite to get built and delivered by manufacturer? How much does it cost to put the satellite into orbit, or is it already included in the cost?

Slide #3:
4. Globalstar completed a $1bn capex in 2013, yet has annual revenues of about $97mn only. It has ~0.7mn subscribers, and the ARPU average revenue per user comes to ~ $137. Does the company expect significant growth in subscriber numbers and ARPU, both?

Slide #6:
5. ""Company has already initiated proceedings in certain countries and by Q1 2017 will have initiated proceedings in countries representing a combined population of 375 million."" How soon does the company expect to obtain these approvals?

Please let me know if anyone is tracking GSAT, and what you think of my queries. Thanks.",3,0.72,1493922324,"[['GSAT', 1]]",GSAT,1.649999976158142,2.5899999141693115
t3_6a46td,Is value investing obsolete or are we just in shit times?,"Ok, so obviously value investing is still a great framework, etc. But how many of you guys have actually found good opportunities that fits within its loose definition? I mean really good ideas, not leveraged cases where the business is in an existential crisis?

Good companies with steady earnings are trading at very high multiples and growth stories are trading into the stratosphere.

We're almost a decade into the recovery of the last crisis, and the Fed hasn't moved the interest up much. So we've got pretty darn expensive markets and the eventuality of higher interest rates. Either that or we get another crisis emanating from Europe or China.

Is cash the answer? Maybe. 

So this is undoubtedly a difficult time to be a value investor in the traditional sense.You won't get too many good deals.

You can try to find a good opportunity that somebody else hasn't realized yet, i.e. a growth story, but that's extremely hard. Few of us are lucky to get those or smart enough to recognize them.

This isn't like the times of young Buffett when you found decent companies at a fraction of liquidation value.

Has investing become an unrewarding endeavor at this stage? 

I myself am heavily concentrated in 3 stocks, 2 of which are OTC. I consider them good companies and priced attractively. You don't need a lot of ideas, you only need 1, true. But it just feels like there's not too many great choices out there. Not too much gets me excited at the moment. 

Low rates, low economic growth, expensive market. If nothing happens, career investors suffer. If a crisis happens, new investors can do well, people with all their money in the market will suffer. If we get a sudden booth in growth, people on the fear train, who have suffered, will continue to suffer. That's all fine I guess, but it's not going to be easy for the majority of ""value investors"" to do well in the future is my guess. The game has gotten much harder. I'd say we're just in shit times for enterprising minds. Will value come back in vogue later on? Probably, but probably not in its original Grahamian form. The wait might take a damn long while though. TSLA and AMZN are not value investments. AAPL might have been, but the questions you have to ask are just so damn big. Not a traditional value investment but definitely of a similar vein.

Just a rant on my views. How do you guys all feel?

**Edit:** Also if I may add. Why the hell does anybody here give a damn about what Munger or even Buffett says? They're managing billions so they have a tiny opportunity set. They wouldn't have become the people they are today by following what they're doing today when they were younger. I respect them as well but their advice is irrelevant unless you're managing billions.

**Edit2:** I hope I'm not the only one on this reddit not managing billions.

**Edit3:** Thanks to the open debate on this thread along with some people sharing their recent ideas, I feel much more optimistic than I did when I began writing this post. I still feel discomfort operating in such an expensive market, but it's good to be reminded again that you only need a few good ideas to make money.",21,0.8200000000000001,1494318911,"[['TSLA', 1], ['AMZN', 1], ['AAPL', 1]]",TSLA,61.81999969482422,64.01200103759766
t3_6aevsx,requesting advice for attending first shareholder meeting,"Hi guys,

I wanted to get some advice - I'm attending my first shareholder meeting during the first week of June. My employer (a wealthy family) is sending me on his behalf and would like me to ask some questions at the shareholder meeting. It is a company in liquidation (New York REIT).

I wanted to get some tips on how exactly these go down? I see in the proxy form that they will be voting on keeping the same auditor, as well as the board members, etc. That's pretty standard stuff.

At what point does Q&A come in? And do I need to bring anything with me to show that I'm going as a representative on behalf of my boss? Or can I just walk in, as long as I show them my license? I don't really care about the voting part, moreso about being able to ask questions.

My boss also wants me to try and meet with management team (mostly the new CEO who was just brought in) outside of the meeting. He probably owns a little over $1M of the stock (vs. $1.6B market cap), but based on the results of this meeting, I would have the authorization to buy a lot more. How would I go about setting this up? Is it as easy as just emailing IR and if I'm lucky, they'll agree?

Sorry of these questions sound amateurish - I have never been to a shareholder meeting before haha.

t3_6c2ly7,Recommendation for a company on the basis of which I could do security research for educational / practice purposes,"Dear all,

I want to do a financial analysis on a company in order to determine if it is over/undervalued. I already do have quite some background knowledge given that I passed the first CFA exam and have an university education with a finance background. So while my fundamentals, what theory is regarded should be solid, I also want to test these in practice (also as a means to build up a bit of Excel infrastructure if I would value any other company in the future or in the context of an interview). 

What I would be asking for it you could recommend a publicly traded company, based in Europe, that is not a financial company, with well defined financial statements (so I can test all these ""juicy"" ratios we get to study for the analyst exams in one go), which is preferably already analysed somewhere on the internet (I would want to compare my results with the website) and finally which is preferably well defined in the sense of the industry it is operating in (thus it is not a multinational conglomerate of X different industries).

t3_6d1mw1,Help understanding HD's balance sheet - shareholder equity,"Hello to the Security Analysis community! I could use some help understanding what's going on in Home Depot's balance sheet. I'm not a necessary a novice with equity analysis, but I'm certainly not an expert, and I would really appreciate some insight on what I'm describing below!


I was doing a quick research of the company's financials. I typically first like to review some key financial ratios, before diving into the financial statements. I like to see a low debt/equity ratio; I prefer to see 60% or less (although I'll admit that I don't fully understand why it's good for equity to be a good measuring stick against the company's debt...). I was astonished to see that HD has a debt-to-equity of something like 500%!!! So I looked at the balance sheet to better understand why that is, and the debt side of the equation looks OK compared to its assets, and not out of line with what I have seen on balance sheets of many strong companies... but shareholder equity has been tanking the last few years, which is what is driving the high D/E ratio.


Diving into the balance sheet:

-Total debt: 23.6B

-Equity:

    -Common stock: 88M

    -Additional paid-in capital: 9.7B

    -Retained earnings: 35.5B

    -Treasury stock - common: 40.2B

    -Total ""other equity"": 867M

    -Sum of equity: 88+9,700+35,500-40,200-867 = 4.2B


Total debt-to-equity: 561%


So the biggest drivers of equity above are retained earnings and treasury stock. Looking at the 5 year trends for each, treasury stock has grown at a much faster rate than retained earnings, which is what is causing the total equity to decline. My understanding is that treasury stock is essentially the value of the shares the company buys back, so this appears to be an intentional strategy by HD's management. Please correct me if my understanding about this is incorrect :)


I would like to better understand the big picture: Is it a bad thing for shareholder equity to remain low like this, especially since it is largely due to management's decision to buy back stock? If so, why would they choose to do this? I understand the general concept of shareholder equity, and more seems to be better, but I don't understand if it's a bad thing for HD to have low equity compared to its debt, etc, and if so, why. Also, more broadly, why is shareholder equity a good measuring stick against the company's debt?


Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

When analysing a company having made a recent merger or acquisition, is there any particular way to account for the large differences it can make to the income statement?

For example, $WDC made their merger with SanDisk last year, and because of one time payments due to this, incurred 2 quarters of significant net losses, in a streak of otherwise positive quarters and growing revenue. In building the DCF model for $WDC, the 2 quarters of net loss would greatly impact the model, even though they only represented one time costs.

Beating the Street by Peter Lynch - mostly relative valuations and going to malls for research. I would like to hear his thoughts on that now since the advent of econmerce.

I've been looking into Aswath Damadoran since he seems to be one of the few that talks about the actual valuation method (DCF).  Do people recommend any specific books of his? I watched his Google talks and have been looking into The Little Book of Valuation. Are there any others?

Also, I've heard that Buffett says that you shouldn't be calculating it all down to 2+ decimals. He says he does it quickly in his head. It makes sense since he's looking at 1000's of companies and there should be a margin of safety.

Aswath seems to take it down to the deep end looking into WACC's, APV's, and making large excel sheets. 

I can't see Buffett making excel models for all of the companies he's sifting through since he doesn't even use a computer. Do you guess that he filters companies out with relative analysis then does a rough mental DCF model in his head from all his experience?

t3_6g79sx,There are 5 or 6 Canadian cannabis companies worth buying right now. Emerald Health trades the farthest below intrinsic value and is the only one that easily has 500-1500% w/ significant margin of safety based on present value of future cash flows.,"I wrote it all on my website with better formatting but here are my thoughts on the most recent joint venture announcement by Emerald Health, a licensed producer of cannabis in Canada. This $120 million market cap cannabis licensed producer now has the ability to net $40 million or more annually by 2019 (legalisation occurs Summer 2018). Emerald is both undervalued relative to intrinsic value and relative to peers. The industry economics are starting to unfold around the cannabis industry and it looks like there is a strong possibility of high FCF, high margins, price regulation (good for commodity), supply lagging demand for years (huge plus for investment merit), low reinvestment requirement and a few other major qualitative and quantitative variables that could lead to above average valuations as well but even at low-end estimates for net income there is still massive profit potential in Emerald.   
  
I have a ton more info about the sector at felkerinvesting.com if you want some good primers on the industry, I keep an updated spreadsheet of the 12 bigger licensed producers as well with all of their current and planned production numbers and some metrics used to show relative value. I currently think there is investment merit in Aurora, Hydropothecary, Organigram, Aphria and Emerald. My allocations are on my site but i think theres a strong argument for Emerald trading significantly below its intrinsic value and the best value of its peer group, id be very surprised if this doesnt 10x over the next 5 years (the small peer group with investment merit, most of those licensed producers are smoke and mirrors and promises).  
  
This is the fastball that Buffett says to swing at. Its being legalised, the industry economics are easy to understand and more importantly, there are a variety of qualitative and quantitative variables that could lead to very positive investment merit and  above average valuations due to some legislative and industry factors. A brand new industry does not pop out of the ground every year, there are still some high quality companies that are significantly underpriced right now because cash flows from legalisation are a year away and because its such a small inefficient market (banks cant own this, its not legal yet and the companies are all 100-200m (minus the big 2) and arnt on anyones radar + there was a downturn).  
  
Please trust me. Just do your own DD and read my primers and other thoughts on the industry, this is the only 300-500% youre going to see in 3-5 years and theres still a few companies that can 10x. Plus its still an extremely infant industry with a ton of room for growth as stigmas fade and the medicinal uses are more commonly known; there are non-psychoactive (dont get you high) ways to use cannabis in 1 drop of tasteless oil every day that will challenge billions in medicinal revenue.  
   
_______________________________________________________________________
  
http://www.felkerinvesting.com/2017/06/emerald-health-therapeutics-emc-and.html  

Earlier this week we saw a game-changing move in the cannabis industry with Emerald Health Therapeutics ($EMH) entering into a joint venture with Village Farms ($VFF), a North American produce-growing company with 4.8 million sq ft of greenhouses in British Columbia, 30 years of operational experience and 750 years of combined ""master grower"" experience. In the joint venture, Emerald Health will pay $20 million (in tranches) for a 50% stake in the JV that will lease (with the option to buy) 1.1 million sq ft. of existing greenhouse and the option to lease or purchase an additional 3.7 million sq ft. of existing greenhouses owned by Village Farms (for 4.8 million sq ft total). The 1.1 million sq ft. greenhouse is projected for 75,000,000 grams annually and the 4.8 million sq ft. of total greenhouse space should yield over 300,000,000 grams. This puts Emerald Health at the best relative value in the industry by a large margin and also provides the largest margin of safety relative to intrinsic value.  
  
This joint venture with Village Farms might be the best acquisition/partnership that we have seen in the industry so far. At $20 million for 50% of the JV-owned 1.1 million sq ft. and 75,000,000 grams annually, Emerald paid $36/sq ft. (1.1 mil / 2 = 550,000 sq ft. ; $20,000,000 / 550,000 sq ft) and $0.53/gram of annual production ($20,000,000 / 37,500,000 grams); this is comparable to Aphrias' greenhouse construction cost of $50/sq ft. and $0.66/gram of annual production, or to $250/sq ft. and $2.56/gram of annual production for Auroras' acquisition cost for Peleton Pharma (for acquisitions, there are comparable numbers in my article on the Mettrum acquisition HERE); it is even comparable to Emeralds' cost for their existing greenhouse that was projected to cost $10,000,000 per 10,000,000 grams of production. The cost for the retrofit of the greenhouse could exceed $20 million but it would have to double/triple before it becomes overpriced relative to other industry acquisitions/partnerships. The JV deal is also to be paid in tranches with only $2 million up front and $18 million to be paid out as milestones are reached, this saves Emerald on the back end if the deal falls through or isn't finished according to plan. Most importantly, in my opinion, is that Emerald just paid $20,000,000 for 37,500,000 grams of annual production, which should end up producing $30,000,000-40,000,000 net, annually.  
  
Emerald will still need to retrofit the existing greenhouses for cannabis production, which according to Village Farms most recent investor presentation, should initiate the cultivation license process in June 2017, the greenhouse conversion process in Summer 2017 (completing March 2018), and the growing process in late 2018. It seems that an in-process tomato crop in the current greenhouse is delaying the process (tomato crop completed Nov 2017) but even with growing starting late 2018, I'm still optimistic. We obviously want production as soon as possible but this is an eternal industry with a lot of variables still left to play out, a 6 month delay from legalization does not ruin the investment merit of this company and the point still stands that they are priced at close to 2-3x net income for 2019 (without the addition 3.7 million sq ft from the JV and further expansion on their own facility). Emerald also has 10,000,000 grams planned for production by legalization from their current facility in British Columbia and up to 100,000,000 grams if the full footprint is built out.  
  
A quick look at market caps and production across the sector show relative value for Emerald.  
  
Market values, planned production, and price per gram of production as of June 8, 2017  
Aurora - $680 million - 99.8 million grams - $6.5 per gram of production  
Canopy - $1.25 billion - 92 million grams - $13.5 per gram of production  
Aphria - $720 million - 75 million grams - $9.5 per gram of production  
Organigram - $230 million - 26 million grams - $9 per gram of production  
Hydropothecary - $150 million - 29 million grams - $5.1 per gram of production  
**Emerald - $120 million - 47.5 million grams - $2.5 per gram of production**  
  
Price per gram of production is a metric that I created to show relative value between companies, based on their planned production relative to their market capitalization. Obviously some companies will deserve a better premium over others based on management, ancillary services, location, competitive advantage, etc.   
  
We see here that Emerald is priced at almost 1/2 of Organigram while producing almost 2x more product. Emerald is also 17.5% the size of Aurora but is slated to produce 50% as much product, if Emerald was priced the same as Aurora (in terms of price per gram of planned production) it would be worth $308,750,000, obviously Aurora is going to be worth more per gram of production because they have a different management, different financing, different location, different medicinal patients, etc. but Emerald still has incredible value when looking at relative industry valuations and valuation relative to net income.  
  
For a better relative valuation, Aphria has 75,000,000 grams projected from their 1,000,000 sq ft. greenhouse completing construction in July-August 2018 (growing starting just before or around the same time as Emerald); Emerald is projecting 47,500,000 grams annually (67% of Aphria production) and is priced at 17% of Aphria. Both of these companies use greenhouses and both are low-cost producers.  
  
When looking at future potential production, Emerald has a maximum capacity now of 250,000,000 grams annually (at low-end production estimates, more than any other LP) which could net $250,000,000 annually (2x its current market cap). Aurora maximum production is 150,000,000 (50,000,000 of which is dependent on a facility that hasn't been started and is only in the planning/zoning stage, we also haven't heard about the additional facility in quite a few months), Canopy maximum production is 130,000,000 grams (with construction on a large portion of this incomplete/unstarted), this leaves Emerald with the largest potential production for the industry, by far. This is also extremely beneficial for Emerald because, unlike almost ever other LP, these production numbers are backed by actual completed greenhouses (retrofitting is still required, but doesn't require full bottom-up construction and planning like most other LPs). My biggest issue with this industry (and the reason I created this spreadsheet) is that the majority of the LPs have planned so much but have so little construction actually underway, Emerald benefits here by not having to plan and construct new facilities from the ground up.  
  
Village Farms is located in one of the best climates in Canada for greenhouses, the coldest temperatures during the winter tend to stay above 0 degrees Celsius which should help with heating costs. Aurora, for example, experiences a ""real"" winter that will require higher heating costs that will cut into COGS during the winter months. Village Farms also owns a 7 MW power plant that is fueled by recycling landfill gas, it is unsure if this is going to be used for the JV.  
  
Emerald Health also provides the highest margin of safety relative to intrinsic value out of any LP that I follow. Margin of safety is also most apparent for Emerald in the case of a production limit (something that is very possible in the future once supply overtakes demand); Aurora also provides a strong margin of safety in this case, not because of margin of safety relative to IV but because they own a supply chain in Germany that could take excess product that might not be allowed in Canada.  
  
Risks  
  
Emerald (and Village Farms) will still have to raise additional capital to build out the first facility and to retrofit the additional 3.7 million sq ft., this will lead to dilution. I dont have much of a disdain for necessary dilution (especially dilution that pays for itself 2x over within its first year or two of production).  
  
There is risk of the retrofit being more costly than planned or lagging the proposed timeline. Although extra costs are possible (probable?), lagging the timeline is less possible because the $20 million funding from EMH is in tranches to be paid out based on completing milestones.  
  
I would also like to know the leasing agreement for the facility and whether the power plant will be used to subsidize power costs. I would also like to see the costs for acquiring the additional facilities.  
  
I am interested in how the 50% ownership will work for Village Farms, will they sell the product to Emerald? Will they receive their own cultivation/sales license and sell their 50% of production themselves? What prices will they be charging Emerald, if Emerald buys their product, or will they sell it to competing LPs? Are all profits from EMH sales from the facilities split in 50%? Will the JV sell under their own label, with 50% of profits funneling to each partner? Sell under Emerald, with 50% of profits going to each partner? Village Farms is definitely undervalued now, but there are so many questions when trying to determine just how undervalued they are.  
  
It also seems like these acquired greenhouses are not as automated as the Aphria/Aurora greenhouses (although labeled ""state of the art"" in their investor presentation). Are these facilities going to have a long life? Is there significant capital spending required in the future for upkeep? Are the facilities going to produce significantly less per square foot as the automated facilities (projections are below-average but estimates are said to be conservative)?  
  
Price Targets  
  
Im writing an article on price targets across the industry so I wont go into extreme detail here. This is an extremely simplified price target and in no way represents my analysis on the industry, this company or this JV; this is a quick calculation based on net income for the growth phase on an industry that could very well end up completely different based on how various qualitative/quantitative variables play out.
  
In 2018, Emerald should net $0-10 million depending on how revenues play out from their 10,000,000 gram/100,000 sq ft. facility that is supposed to be finished by legalization. Emerald could net $40-50 million annually from this JV and their facilities combined for 2019 (depending on spending and operations; net incomes should be low for initial phases of legalization due to required spending for expansion). Emerald also has the opportunity to obtain the rest of the 4.8 million sq ft. available, which could push them over $150 million net (47.5 million current + 150 million if all 4.8 million sq ft. is utilized, minus margin of safety; also not including the rest of the 32 acres that Emerald owns that could add another 90 million grams annually if built out).  
  
If this joint venture doesn't hit any major roadblocks, Emerald should be worth well over $800,000,000 by 2019. $800,000,000 represents a 20 PE on $40,000,000 (less than $1/net on 47.5 million grams, a low end projection w/ margin of safety), this disregards any additional expansion on their own 1.4 million sq ft. property or the acquisition of the 3.7 million sq ft. that Village Farms has remaining in the JV contract. I also believe that valuations for this industry could be higher than average because of a variety of reasons that I've listed HERE in my analysis on the industry.  
  
I believe that Emerald now has the best potential to be the largest licensed producer in Canada, based on all current information. It is not crazy to think that Emerald could be worth $1.5-3 billion down the road if there is a market for the 300 million grams that the JV could potentially produce across its 4.8 million sq ft. of greenhouses, plus there is the 1.4 million sq ft. of land that Emerald leases in BC (from the CEO).

t3_6mju4s,MET: Life Insurance valuation a hopeless cause?,"Dipping my toes into MET in advance of BHL's upcoming spin-off and I gotta say, financial companies -- especially life insurance -- seem too intractable to pin down.

My understanding so far is that it all comes down to signing policies, effectively managing the risk borne by those same policies, and receiving moderate returns on the available float. Since the 08-ish crisis, regulatory requirements have become more stringent, further increasing coverage demands. The spin-off of BHL seems like an effort by MET to avoid uncertainty surrounding pending regulatory requirement changes that could be coming down the pike for life insurance (LH). That, and given Property Casualty (PC) insurance has a different set of dynamics, it appears MET would prefer to focus its efforts on a single front rather than chase a second rabbit.

But goodness... Made some charts and lots of notes, but it still seems awfully opaque. It's all one giant theoretical probability orgy complete with ""conditional tail expectations"", asset rating categories, and a bunch of other similarly worthless calculations. I assume peers are roughly the same on this matter, I doubt there's much variance in the sense that competitors each run similar actuarial tables. For example, no executive team in their right mind would willingly assume a ton of tail risk just to be different from the pack, PLUS! the regulatory requirements and looking-over-their-shoulder ratings agencies strongly encourage a sort of conformity.

Practically speaking, insurance can increase/reduce risk through new policy initiatives, and I imagine that takes some time to cycle through to new customers in a material way. So it's a slow moving industry in that sense just by the law of numbers. Which means cost cutting cost cutting cost cutting is the main lever management can pull. Either that or fundamentally altering its in-force policy contracts by restructuring its business in the form of say, you guessed it, a spin-off.

However, I'm tempted to toss this squarely in the ""too difficult"" bin. There seems to be so many nooks and crannies to tuck away poor performance.

t3_6myzyk,Strong moats = monopolies,"Many investors go the ""Buffett"" route and look for companies with large moats - a durable competitive advantage.

I recently read Peter Thiel's book ""Zero to One"" and he talks thoroughly about how he looks for startups with monopolistic-like characteristics. He categorizes businesses in a spectrum from ""perfect competition"" to ""monopolies"". Perfect competition being where there are tons of players in the industry and they essentially compete away all the profits (ie; restaurants, t-shirt shops, groceries, etc.) and monopolies which are self-explanatory.

This got me thinking that companies with strong moats are essentially just monopolies since they do not allow competition from chipping away their profits.

If you are looking at companies with strong moats, those companies will essentially always be the top players in their industry. They will typically have the higher ROE, profit margin, revenues/earnings, etc. than their competitors. This inevitably happens since they have a stranglehold on the market share. Think Google as a search engine, Microsoft as an OS, Apple as a smart phone provider, Coke as the leading soft drink, Amazon as the ecommerce hub, etc.

The cash flows of monopolies are essentially a certainty and calculating a PV on their future cash flows seems like it would be a cinch. Would it not be best to invest in these companies once the price is somewhat reasonable no matter what? It might take years for that opportunity to happen, but why wouldn't this be a simple and profitable methodology to follow?",27,0.88,1499915627,"[['PV', 1]]",,,
t3_6nmgjb,Calculating portfolio returns - Need help to confirm if I am doing it correctly on Excel,"Generally, I get it that there are two ways to calculate returns. 

1) (End value - Start value)/(End value)

2) Using IRR calculation

The first method is simple enough, but will likely understate returns if you are buying new stocks and adding to your positions throughout the year (especially if this is the first year you're investing). 

The second method (for now) seems bad as well cause it is overstating my portfolio returns, but will likely normalize once I can get a full year to analyze. 

Anyways, for the second IRR method, I use the XIRR Excel formula. I just want to know if I am doing it correctly or not. In particular, with regards to the dividend.

I am reading Benjamin Grahams's The Intelligent Investor, and wanted to make a couple inquiries. I am reading through bonds at the moment and had the following questions that I am hoping someone would be willing to explain to me:

1. I do not understand the inverse relationship of bond prices to yields. If I am loaning out money to the government or a company at a greater price, shouldnt I demand a higher yield?

2. Seeing how the T bills of the 70s yielded much higher yields than today, am I to assume that the current treasury bond market isnt worth looking at despite an unprecedented bull market we are in?

3. If I am to purchase a bond at above 100, that implies I bought the bond at a premium, correct? If it is cutting into the returns I would expect to receive, why would anyone want to enter this agreement?

4. What happens if I hope a bond past its maturity date? Will that mean I cannot redeem it?

t3_6oqb1d,"Department store apocalypse investment idea, own their real estate, or buy the firm?","Hi, I'm considering buying real estate tenanted by public companies in the department store sector. I've been drawn to investments in the retail space because there are companies trading well below historical price/book value, the retail apocalypse may price some companies post-bankruptcy, where bankruptcy may not be so certain, potentially revealing opportunities for margin of safety.
Also, in both cases I have an opportunity to invest in real estate with these companies are the tenant.
So, I would like to be able to compare an investment in real estate occupied by these companies, bonds, and common stock.

For Bon-Ton. In 2007 a private equity firm bought the company and loaded it with debt, it has not found much profitability during this history. The stock price peaked at $56 in 2007, on high hopes that the private equity firm will earn money for shareholders.  The recession hit, and in 2008 the stock was trading for $1.19, then reached $18 in 2010, $3 in 2011, $21 in 2013, and now trading as low at $0.73. The high volatility is due to the speculative capital structure (high debt, little equity). 
The gross margins are stable at 37%, but high SG&A have led to its first operating loss in the TTM since 2009. Operating margins have been historically low since 2012 and dramatically dropped below 2% to 0.35% in 2016. The company has a heavy debt burden, as mentioned, about $70m a year in payments, much of their debt from 2007 has been paid off, but due to current operating losses this debt is rising. The company's cash on hand is about $7m, which is flat since 2013, a sign of capable cash management. Capital lease obligations have risen since 2016 from 45m to 127m. Debt is currently approximately equal to the company's assets, leaving a negative equity position. I researched that corporate bonds are currently trading at 40% of par with an 8 coupon rate, yield to maturity of about 37%. Current net losses are $57m (2016) $63m (2017) and $83m (TTM). The company has expanded by purchasing property, plant, equipment of about $50m per year. There is no stock repurchases.
Insider ownership has risen from 15% in 2014 to 25% in 2017. Is that signs of optimism in the common stock?

This company, along with many other retailers have dealt with declining Q4 revenues, current top line revenues have dropped to 2009 revenues (2015 & 2016). While it is likely that we are in a weak spending cycle (approximately once every 7-10 years going back to 1995). It is said that they have a 25% of defaulting on debt over the next 12 months. We need to know whether the company's balance sheet can survive another 2-3 years of negative earnings, or not. Can the company aggressively sell off assets to pay down debt while keeping locations open that are capable of the debt service plus profits? Did their untimely expansion in 2007 cause them to a ultimate bankruptcy, or will this company work out? And, given these unknowns, what is a fair price to pay for the common stock. How cheap is cheap enough? The stock traded as low as a $6m market cap last week, and is currently around $17m in market cap, in 2007 the market cap was over $1 billion, and over $400m in 2013.
Will the debtors force bankrupty, or continue to provide financing.
Is the current down turn a permanent shift due to Amazon, is America in a retail specific recession, are the recent retail closures/bankruptcy affecting the foot traffic of other retailers (yes), or is there a combination of negative factors causing operating (probably).
If the common stock makes sense, at what price, in market cap? $20m, $10m, $5m, $0m?

And then there is the real estate. I have a property under contract, tenanted by BonTon. It pays about $350,000 per year in net income (NNN lease), with a lease until end of 2021 (about 4 years left), guaranteed income of about $1,400,000 in 4 years.
Vacant, the building would be worth maybe $400,000. With a 10-year lease, it could be worth over $4,000,000. I would personally try to acquire the property for about $1,000,000 - $2,000,000, with a mortgage loan on the property.

**Where on the capital structure do I want to be?** Stocks, bonds, real estate.

Do I want to buy the real estate, fee-simple with a lease by a company close to bankruptcy? I should know whether my lease get paid in full despite a bankruptcy proceeding? There is a corporate guarantee on the lease, but how do I know exactly if I the terms will hold up in bankruptcy. 
If I buy the real estate, I think I can assume a 17-20% cash flow return (unleveraged), leveraged with 50% would drop cash flow to $300,000 but increase cash on cash to about 40%/year for 4 years.

For starters, I think we can remove the corporate bond route, because that only has a chance of being redeemed at par, with little speculative advantage afterwards, a nice return, but I can accomplish this the same with the real estate, and bonds are paid after real estate leases, I believe, plus at the end of the lease term I am left with an asset. 
In comparison to common stock, it is not as obvious.
For the price I pay for 1 piece of real estate ($2,000,000 earning 17% return), I could buy 10% of the entire company. That includes operation of over 250 stores.

My mind started to take me in thoughts about how to do both real estate and get exposure to the speculative upside of the company if it were to survive.

For comparable analysis, Gordman's (a bankrupt competing department store retailer) was recently bought for $75,000,000, in cash, by Stage Stores, very low debt in this deal (as well as Stage Stores). Gordman's enterprise value ([according to gurufocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/financials/GMANQ) was $77m as of the 2016 bankruptcy))
Gordman's had higher gross margins than Bonton and Stage Stores (41%) and couldn't keep SG&A costs down during periods of declining revenue. These operating losses were not financed by more debt, although $44m was taken out in 2014

The market cap of Gordman's was about close to par of the Enterprise value, until 2014 where market cap began to decline down to about 50% of Enterprise Value. The liquidation price, already noted, was for approximately the enterprise value. Debt at the time was about $30m.
More successful retailers like Kohls and Dillards are trading for about 60-80% of book value right now, while losers Sears and JCP are selling at about 20-25% of book value. 

What do you think about Bonton, at 1.4% of Book Value! A fair chance of default ~25%, inventories about equal to long term debt.
Or Stage Stores at 21% of Book Value, but with NO chance of default, Current Assets greater than Total Liabilities, plus they are making acquisitions.

And considering I could own the real estate of Bonton for the price of 10% of the entire company, how should I look at this situation in the most profitable, least risky way.  Could I somehow leverage the real estate and make a hedge using the common stock's upside (given its highly speculative pricing, the little equity present will be volatile).

t3_6qs30p,"The End of Coca Cola, P&G and the traditional business model","Going to be stepping on some holy grounds here so please hold the crucifix for now. 

One of the things I got to thinking over the past several years was about whether the business model we have seen Buffet and other investors invest in continue to make sense or not. I know this sound crazy but hear me out. We all know the story of Coca Cola, the low price, inelastic, semi-addictive product then converted into large global distribution base and brand portfolio. The story of the company for the past 40 years was about building out this massive global distribution footprint to the point where it was easier to find a bottle of coke in some rural Indian village than a bottle of water. But there are some problems to this model, primarily that A) You can't really find another 1-2 billion consumers now B) It is hard to capture consumer surplus (price segregation is impossible and C) it is hard to capture increasing share of the consumer wallet as living standards improve. (people will cap out on how much product to drink a day). 

And I got to think about the problem with mass distribution or infrastructure models, usually the core is highly profitable and end up subsidizing the hinterlands, the last mile country road to a small town is a very unprofitable investment. In my mind, this is also a problems existing CPG companies face, the last customers is hard to reach, expensive to acquire, at some point it is much better to increase wallet share and/or capture the consumer surplus of your core base of customers. This is why targeted ads are changing marketing so much, as it allows companies to price segregate by customers (different tier of a similar product) and big data is so valuable (increasing wallet share). 

I wonder if the time for traditional companies that relies on the formula of building out distribution, acquire/develop a bunch of products and push through your channels is over. The rise of third party infrastructure rails like Amazon and facebook for distribution and customer aggregation also has removed the needs for doing that yourself. I feel the economic laws revolving around specialization will push companies to being more product oriented and focused on capturing consumer surpluses through niche products. The obvious play is that the infrastructure rails will capture a large part of the economics, but who knows if big scaled brands even exist 10-20 years down the line?

t3_6rllin,FL and GME (Foot locker + gamestop) -- Dying or undervalued?,"I've been giving these companies a lot of thought for several weeks now, and both appear to be deep value opportunities on the surface. Foot locker has been steadily increasing YoY earnings, pays a 2.6 div which it fully supports with its cash position, has favorable earnings multiples, etc. but is the fear of its extinction warranted, or pushing the stock to a fantastic buy level? The main fear here is obviously online retail competing away brick and mortar (namely amazon, specifically its deal with Nike), but I am wondering if there is something to be said for shoes as a specialty retailer who actually often requires a brick and mortar visit. Will there always be those who like to try on their shoes, or line up around the block for the biggest release? Or will those trends be eaten up by online consumption in due time. Gamestop similar story. Beautiful picture surrounding the numbers of the stock, 7% dividend supported by balance sheet, fairly flat growth, but selling at a low 6X earnings multiple, and the store itself is very cyclical when you talk to its clientele and staff. Big console releases can make or break earnings, and the current console generation is 5 years in, leaving us ripe for some releases that drive up same store sales. To me this implies that its sunk to a low multiple on disappointing growth, but a rebound remains possible, meanwhile the dividend is attractive enough to adequately compensate for the risk. The 2 encroachers here are Amazon again, and the ease of buying things online -- will we all be doing it in a few years, regardless of release hype, or the easy used game business. More directly, Gamestop is threatened by the increasing prevalence of digital releases, undermining the need to even order a game in the mail, let alone step out to buy it.

Do you think there is reason to believe that either of these 2 companies could decline to the point of collapse? Or is there sufficient margin of safety to make entry into these positions to see a market recovery.

t3_6vkqn7,what is the purpose of an MLP?,"I'm asking this question more from the perspective of the sponsor/general partner.

1. So you have say an oil/gas/coal/ that also happens to have midstream assets like a pipeline.

2. The assets earn consistent cash flow, which makes them appropriate to put into an MLP structure that pays a dividend, as MLP investors who want income are attracted to the consistent nature of the dividend.

3. The sponsor/GP drops down these consistent-cashflow-producing assets into the MLP, receiving either cash from new shares the MLP issues to the public or MLP shares in exchange for those assets. The GP also gets IDRs, where if the MLP pays out more dividends than some threshold, the GP gets a large portion of it vs. the MLP unit holders. So the GP, which manages the MLP, is incentivized to have the MLP grow its cash dividends, which ends up benefitting MLP unit holders overall, but the GP to a bigger extent.

4. MLP unit holders get favorable tax treatment - distributions reduce cost basis and once cost basis is below $0, distributions are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. 

So what is the benefit to the sponsor or GP here as far as dropping the asset into the MLP as opposed to just hanging onto it?

Is it that MLP investors, who are typically very yield hungry, will pay more for the asset when it's put into the MLP as opposed to if the sponsor tried to sell the asset directly to another buyer (like another E&P)?",6,0.8,1503511077,"[['MLP', 12], ['GP', 4]]",MLP,12.270000457763672,13.199999809265137

t3_6zry1o,STRI--- A NET NET trading at 10% of tangible assets.,"STRI( STR Holding Inc.) has been a stock beat up on for years. They are a solar encapsulate company that has suffered from negative margins and falling market share. After selling a large stake to a Chinese solar company they were hoping to compete more cheaply with a new cenergy but falling prices and un-credit worthy customers made it clear that an American company in China is unable to compete in this industry. With that realization, they are closing all Chinese operations and moving into India, where we are assured that there is higher profit and more trustworthy customers, but I have my doubts.

So all that being said I think this is one of best stocks on the market. As of 6/30/17 their balance sheet has 14M cash/ 20M current assets/ 35M total assets and 6M total debt. That is 8M net cash/ 14M net current assets and 29M net tangible assets. Oh, silly me, I forgot to mention this is all currently selling for a market cap of 3.5M. They are also in the process of selling a factory for 6M cash. So they selling at around 25% of net cash alone.

For a fire sale like this you would assume, and most of the time be correct, that this is too good to be true. But they are not printing new shares/ going dark/ raising debt/ chinese or going bankrupt any time soon. In fact they are running a burn rate of about 300K a quarter. That would give them almost 12 years to figure out a plan even if they don't sell more assets or turn profitable.

To me this fits all my classic marks for a simple mean reversion. They can become profitable with current business/buy another profitable business with cash/liquidate or slowly burn through assets for years, in which case you will have plenty of time to sell.  The low prices are a function of being OTC and being unprofitable. But because its otc you are mostly dealing individual investors who long on ideas and short on time horizon. This is simple time arbitrate and if you can stomach leaving your money in this for two to three years I would guess that you will have handily beat what we all expect the S and P to do over that same time frame.

This is my first write up ever so I would love your feed back but even if you dont like my write-up of STRI try any of the bellow links of write-ups done in the last year.

t3_72lq36,Grocery Sector,"Hey everyone,

Im looking at the bombed out grocery Sector (specifically Kroger) for opportunity and I'm finding it hard to see lots of asymmetric upside here.

Groceries are a stable business but highly competitive, low margin, and the industry seems to struggle earning excess returns.

Becuase margins are so slim and there's opps for operating leverage it seems to me a core driver of valuation is sales growth, which is largely driven by inflation dynamics on a macro level. My issue with that is that in inflation, wholesale prices rise faster than retail and I'd imagine grocers try to keep prices low to keep traffic, at the expense of margins. In deflation, everyone is incentivized to cut prices to boost traffic, at the expense of gross margins.

So the way I see it is that no matter what, there is a strong competitive lid on gross margins in either an inflationary or deflationary environment.

Add to that the increased competitive pressures from Amazon (who doesn't care about margins) WMT Aldi and other discount brands, I fail to see the upside case from here for a Kroger, despite the fact they are one of the better operators in the space.

I guess my thought is the macro picture is so bad, and so many of the companies seem to be driven by hard to predict macro variables, that there's not a lot of margin of safety or asymmetry in outcomes in the space.

Am I thinking about this the right way? What am I missing here? ",7,0.89,1506445070,"[['WMT', 1]]",WMT,78.66999816894531,79.77999877929688

It has been around since 1979 and only recently went public (December of last year). What is fascinating is that they did not go public to pay down the debt but for expanding its operations (they already were profitable with sufficient positive free cash flow to fund its operations). The management stated in its recent investor presentation that it seeks to focus primarily on telecomm industry due to its high projected growth for next 5 to 10 years.

It is vertically integrated from manufacturing, sales, and services of these DC power systems and therefore have operated with above industry average margin.

Fortunately company is very predictable however the one big question is tax rate. The company has historically generated significant losses and was only recently profitable so they currently only pay very limited taxes. Assume going forward they will generate sufficient earnings to utilize all the tax benefits. They also have about half a billion in NOLs and a TRA liabilitybfrom an Up-C IPO structure which my understanding is that it reduces future tax burden although they most pay out a majority of that benefit to pre-IPO holders.

Main questions are:
1. How would you think about tax rate 10ish years from now? 
2. How would you think about the NOLs and Up-C payments over time?
3. Looking out very long term as in 20-30+ years once all tax benefits have been utilized, how would you think about a run-rate tax rate? Would it be mainly federal + state taxes + foreign earnings taxes?

t3_74rhhy,Graham and Fisher are telling me to buy FOSL (Fossil Group).,"TL;DR: FOSL could double overnight, and could 10x in 3-5 years. Despite being a profitable operating company over decades and recessions, FOSL (Fossil Group) is trading below book value, due partially legitimately due to reduction in operating income, but exacerbated by Restructuring Charges and a Goodwill write off. These apparent declines in operating quality as actually a part of the improvement of the business in the long run. The stock is trading as if it was a dead zombie, but its future is just beginning. 

Hi all,
In an effort to revisit stock market investing in a better way, I've been reading Graham and Fisher, along with Lynch, Greenblatt, and others. 
I'm considering taking a sizable position, so here is my basic analysis, I hope you can improve on it. 

After writing the below report, these are my thoughts:
This is a chance to buy a global brand that is unwavering operating profits over decades including recessions, including now. The stock is being punished for the following reasons:
1. Declining sales, sales have dropped from $3.5b in 2014 to $2.8 in TTM (2012 levels).  We may see unimpressive sales this Christmas due to the retail 'apocalypse' especially in regards to retail sales and store closures. My only hesitation to pounce on the stock is the opportunity to buy it for 1/2 price if the Christmas season is bad. I'll buy in increments.

2. Restructuring right offs. $150m charge over a few years, making an already weak operating margin worse.

3. Good will write off of $400m due to reduced stock price and impaired sales. (Question: how could goodwill be affiliated with stock price?) 
Adding back the restructuring charges and asset write down, the company earned operating incomes of 567m in 2014, 315m in 2015, $155m in 2016, $93m in TTM. Interest is about $35m/year right now leaving $58m, a 7.6 PE ratio (at 433m market cap). If their earnings return to only $100m/year it would be a 4 PE stock, and if they recover only to 2008/2009 levels of $206m income then the stock is trading at a PE of 2.

I'm primarily handicapped because I don't know what I don't know. Can you tell me why this is isn't a magical time to buy the company, and then buy more if the market tanks because of predictably ugly retail numbers. I think this company is being thrown out with the bath water.

Fisher's 15 points
1. Yes, this company can potentially make a sizable increase in sales for at least several years. It can increase its sales by continuing to deliver products to the tastes a growing population, plus it has room to grow in the global market. (They are opening a new Hong Kong office).

2. Yes, the management is determined to continue to develop products that will increase total sales potentials. This is best demonstrated with the multi-year restructuring program that began in 2016 (""New World Fossil""), which targets improvements in operating profit ($150m investment is supposed to bring over $100m/year in savings), and supports sales growth through a leaner infrastructure and an 'enhanced' business model (not sure what that means), but it likely has to do with optimizing for more ecommerce.

3. The company doesn't do research and development, but it does create new products and new partnerships. In new developments, they have a strong horse in the digital watch space (Fossil entered the top 5  for the first time and much of this is credited to the acquisition of Misfit in late 2015. With a large distribution network of fashion stores and multiple brands Fossil managed to attract a previously unaware audience to the wearables market.) Growth in this space has been phenomenal, increasing market share by 217%. Additionally, they are continually on the cutting edge of fashion brands, and would expect them to maintain this edge (branded watches) as new fashion brands arise in the future.

4. Yes, above average sales organization. Grew sales from 105m in 1993 to $3b in 2016 (peaked at $3.4b in 2014).

5. Yes, worthwhile profit margin. Gross margins are steady over 50%, operating margin is typically around 15%, but has averaged about 11% due to the recent restructuring AND the goodwill write off. Based on the sine-wave trend going back to 1993, it looks like every ±8 years they go through a period of low margins (5), followed by a period of high margins (18). Net margin is usually around 8%. The operating income would cover the interest expense would be covered by 5-10 times on a typical year.

6. The company is improving margins by its $150m restructing plan, downsizing retail locations, increasing investments in digital products, structural improvements in their ecommerce business.

7. Based on their corporate marketing, it looks like Fossil is a great and fun place to work. (rated 3.6 out of 5 on Glassdoor)

8. They recently hired Gail Tifford, VP from Unilever overseeing media and digital strategy, so they are attracting good executive talent.

9. Yes, has depth to management, the growth trend has been for decades, and many people have participated in the success.

10. The company likely has sufficient cost analysis and accounting controls given the scale of their mass production. I don't know a way to check that right now.

11. In relation to competition, we have already seen their explosive growth in digital watches, entering the global top 5 and likely to rise. Fossil has an interesting advantage because of their dedication to leveraging other brands to sell their watches across new and different markets. Most people still wear watches, what you wear is guided by a set of principles you have, and Fossil appears to be above average in providing the fashion accessories that the public wants over a long period of time. I never had a Fossil watch myself, and the first watch I ever wore was a Huawei Android watch, but I didn't like it, then wore a Hamilton automatic watch for about 2 years, until I decided to get a Rolex. The path for Fossil watches wasn't relevant for me personally because I never wore a watch growing up, and by the time that I did I jumped to the best android watch at the time, and then since my real estate business was doing well, I decided to splurge on the Rolex. I am not an example of their potential market, although for a moment when I had an android watch I was, and at that time I might have picked Fossil's version, but they did not have the same products then as they do today, nor the sales numbers!

12. I think that Fossil has the potential to increase their long term profits. The trend is to higher profit margin sales thanks to ecommerce, the question is whether dropping retail sales can be totally made up by ecommerce sales, and retail margins made up by ecommerce margins. No question, the restructing the company is doing is designed to increase margins, the company has a good track record of delivering higher margins after periods of lower sales.

13. With over $300m cash in the bank and a fully profitable operating business, Fossil is unlikely to raise equity to expand their business. In fact, despite cutting back stock repurchases in 2016, they started to pay down their long term debt.

14. Management seems transparent and relevant in regards to discussing the current situation of declining revenue and the two one-time charges (restructuring and goodwill), but I have not spoken with management myself nor listened to their calls.

15. Considering the long track record of the company, its global brand, and watching insiders buy millions of $ in stock is a positive for the sake of their integrity.


Substantial insider buying after the recent down turn in price. Short interest is still very high, over 64%, could that be a mistake on their part at this point? Even after the massive goodwill write off, the stock is trading at .79 Tangible Book, almost equal to the 0.72 PB ratio, this is half of where the stock was in the 2008 recession. 
Around 5 insiders bought shares between $6.99-$8.73, signaling a significant bottom in the stock.
Value investor Joel Greenblatt started buying at $16-27, and increased his position at $9-18.

t3_75hlg0,Let's talk Non-GAAP metrics,"I've been spending some time lately thinking over the concept of Non-GAAP metrics both in terms of practicality of existence as well as the way investors/analysts interpret them. Due to the type of companies I look at, nearly every one has their own Non-GAAP version of adjusted EBITDA/FCF/revenue, etc...

There are certain limits that GAAP imposes on financial reporting. Because businesses and their models change faster than governing bodies can reasonably respond to, sometimes GAAP just doesn't reflect the economic reality of what is going on. 

In light of that, there are times when I think Non-GAAP reporting makes sense and those metrics are useful to look at. For instance, Valeant was known to be a heavy pusher of their Non-GAAP Cash EPS number, but if you go back and look at the add-backs most of them make sense. In fact, the reasons why the Company blew up didn't really have anything to do with their Cash EPS number at all...meaning, it didn't necessarily hide anything insidious that one wouldn't have been able to identify otherwise. 

Of course, I'm a big believer in auditing the add-backs. For example, I recently looked at a Company with reported Adjusted EBITDA of around ~$250.0mn. If I stripped out all of the add-backs, Operational EBITDA was around -$20.0mn. That wouldn't be fair, though, since some add-backs were legitimately non-cash such as impairments and others. So Cash EBITDA comes out at ~$150.0mn. Essentially, ~$100.0mn of the add-backs were sketchy and really recurring cash items. Definitely a curious case where a skeptical mind and vigilant eye towards the reconciliation came in handy, but not necessarily something that I'm going to overly penalize the Company for. 

Where I get frustrated with Non-GAAP metrics isn't really the way which Company's employ them. Sure, they'll highlight them rather than GAAP metrics, maybe have their bonus structured off of Non-GAAP targets, etc but none of that really matters to me because 1) underlying decay in the core business will eventually erode even the most add-backy of Non-GAAP figures since there is only so much one can find to add-back, and 2) you don't get any points in blowing the whistle on Non-GAAP numbers. 

And its the second point where I find myself getting frustrated with the analyst community. For some reason, I find a lot of write-ups and opinions where the analyst crucifies management for trying to ""deceive"" the investing public by adding back certain things to whatever metric. No one is getting deceived. At least, no one who is smart and checks the numbers is. Investing based solely off management's Non-GAAP figures is essentially the same as investing based on an analyst recommendation without doing any work and then blaming the analyst when it goes wrong. 

I have even seen some write-ups where the analyst accuses management of fraud for adding back certain things which is just silly. The add-backs are disclosed, the reconciliation is provided, and the auditor has signed off on it. Besides, as analysts we are all making our own pro-forma adjustments anyway. 

So then how do you look at the figures? 

Refer to my example above (which I affectionately refer to as the add-back queen internally). Cash EBITDA is really -40.0% less than what the Company is reporting and has been flat to LSD declining over the last several years while reported Adjusted EBITDA is flat to LSD increasing over the same period. What I really care about is 1) the underlying performance and trend of the business (my Cash EBITDA #), and 2) whether or not the amount of bad add-backs are shrinking as a % of what is reported as well as if the sequential line-items are recurring or something new. 

In this particular example, underlying performance is deteriorating and the nature of the add-backs is not changing (meaning as a % of Reported as well as recurring nature). My Cash EBITDA number is now supporting a substantial debt load at 7.0x (vs. Reported 4.0x), with near term maturities, low maturity, and the bond slightly off from par. Makes a pretty good short in my opinion. 

Which brings me to final (maybe?) point. Some might say, well the credit agreement allows add-backs of X,Y and Z nature so the Reported figure is what the lenders are looking at and they say it is alright. True, its allowed. But if the business cannot/principal payment and needs to refinance the lenders may say ""sure you have a nice Reported # which we technically allow, but we're not stupid and can see what your real performance is and we're not going to refinance you"". Then, the Company is in serious trouble. 

So I think that wraps up my long winded rant on Non-GAAP figures. I'm not sure if it really ended up in the direction it may have seemed to be going since I just pulled a recent example I could think of, but my main points are that 1) Non-GAAP in itself is not a sin and something a Company should be crucified for, and 2) ultimately, thoughtful analysis of the underlying fundamentals will ultimately get you where you need to go. 

Maybe it would have made more sense if I used an example where everyone hated the Non-GAAP number but it turned out to be right, but oh well. 

Curious to hear any other thoughts on the topic.

t3_78i7hu,Long KO,"Not the most comprehensive pitch I've ever made on here, but I'd also say this is one of the easiest layups I've come across. 

**Investment Thesis** 

The Coca-Cola Company (“KO”) equity represents a rare opportunity to invest in a misunderstood mega-cap that is set to expand margins, grow free cash flow, and increase returns on invested capital. My variant opinion is that at 23.4x NTM earnings, KO equity currently does not price in the upside offered by the forthcoming completion of their bottling operation restructuring efforts and instead reflects the typical consensus story of whether volumes will either be LSD or MSD. Normalized earnings, through the noise of the restructuring operations, show a business that is set to return capital to shareholders after several years of disappointing returns (~5.0% P.A. excl. dividend 2012 – Present). 

**Business Description** 

KO produces syrup concentrate used in the production of various carbonated and un-carbonated beverages. KO’s syrups are sold to bottler partners on a global basis. These bottler partners control regional/local Coca-Cola franchises. The bottlers make the finished product, distributed in bottles and cans. Bottlers are responsible for selling, distributing KO products to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors. 

60% of the Company’s FY16 revenues were derived from the sale of finished products and 40% were derived from the sale of concentrates. 48% of the Company’s FY16 revenues came from the United States while 52% came from international sales. 

It is worth noting that over the past several years KO has made an effort to diversify their brand portfolio away from traditional soft drinks and in to sports drinks and vitamin water-type offerings. 

KO maintains equity investments in their bottling partners and receive both equity-interest income and dividends. The market value of these investments is about $20bn. 

**Situation Overview**
 
Over the past three years, KO has been restructuring their bottler relationships across Europe, China, Japan, Africa and North America which will result in 100% of the Company’s unit case volume being distributed by third-party bottlers rather than KO itself. Bottler restructuring will be complete by the end of 2017. 

Parent KO is divesting their interest in their bottling rights to various partners because their national scale is too large to adequately invest in the local-level relationships necessary to build high-margin bottling operations. Restructured bottlers enter into Comprehensive Beverage Agreements (CBA) with Parent KO under which they are authorized to purchase trademark beverages from KO, or another authorized supplier, and exclusively distribute/sell to territories under their agreement. Each CBA has an indefinitely renewable 10-year term. 

Cash flow from the restructuring has been slow to materialize which is why I suspect these activities are never more than a brief footnote in consensus research. 2014 and 2015 proceeds from re-franchising was $713mn while 2016 proceeds were $2.3bn plus another $2.4bn from the sale of Keurig to JAB Holding Co. 

Proceeds through the end of 2017 should come in around $4.5mn from the sale of Chinese bottling operations, divestiture of remaining North American operations, plus dividends and income from bottling equity investments. Management has been quiet about their capital allocation intentions for these proceeds, but suffice to say they have some levers to pull. Before serious returns to shareholders can begin there are a few obligations KO needs to meet first. $3.2bn to Anheuseur-Busch InBev for their interest in CCBA which should be paid 4Q17 (KO intends to immediately sell the CCBA bottling franchise after this, so maybe it is fair to say this transaction nets out). $3.3bn debt matures in 2018, $4.5bn in 2019, and $4.4bn in 2020. 

**Valuation**

Under the following assumptions – 0.0% revenue and EBIT growth – KO will earn $4.9bn FCF per year. With an additional $4.5bn from 2017 activities the Company will be able to meet all of their upcoming obligations, including scheduled share repurchases and dividend hike, without raising additional debt. In fact, at 2.5x net debt, KO has room for an additional full turn of leverage (approx. $10bn debt) that could be returned to shareholders while comfortably maintaining interest coverage.

But how do normalized earnings look? KO earns a 4.3% pre-tax margin on LTM bottling revenues of $15.9bn. Backing out bottling, KO earns $14.2bn normalized LTM EBITDA and $11.4bn LTM FCF (EBITDA – capex – cash interest) (5.1% yield). Company bottlers earn an average 7.5% pre-tax margin on bottling revenues. Assuming 0.0% growth from acquisition of bottling operations, equity income to KO should grow ~41.0% to $1.4bn given a potential ~70.0% growth in bottling pre-tax income to $1.2bn from $0.7bn (calculated as pro-rata KO share of margin uplift plus historical growth of legacy equity income). 

On flat revenues and margins, this will result in ~$12-13bn FCF per year for KO. This is also likely understated due to the real volume benefit gained by better performing bottling operations (KO gains revenue uplift from selling more syrup to bottlers as well as a % of income due to equity ownership). Maybe a more likely scenario would be in the range of $15bn FCF (6.7% yield) per year for KO with unheroic, LSD volume growth. After debt repayments and other obligations this leaves at least an extra $3bn FCF per year for shareholders without adding incremental debt.

On top of this, KO ex-bottling operations will have $37.5bn invested capital (down about $5bn pre-restructuring). On normalized LTM EBIT this yields an ROIC of 33.9%. 

Can you find equity ideas at a more compelling valuation than a 6.7% FCF yield? Of course you can. But a 6.7% yield seems like a good deal for a $200bn market cap business with entrenched competitive dynamics that sustains a 30.0%+ return on invested capital.

t3_78ptvx,CSV Thoughts,"Does anyone have any opinions on this Company? I am torn. 

For those unfamiliar, CSV is a death-care operator with an EV of about $810mn ($365mn net debt (5.3x), $445mn equity (12.4x). They operate funeral and cemetery businesses as a levered roll-up. Their CEO is super old and has a background in high yield/reorgs. Unsurprisingly, their cap structure has always ridden the edge. 

Over the past 5 years, CSV has grown EBITDA at about 9% annualized. How they achieve this is weird. Consider same-store operating revenues and profit have grown at 3.2% and 5.6% over the same period. Acquired store revenues and profits have grown at 25.2% and 40.3%, respectively. 

About 20% of operating profit is comprised from M&A additions. 

Another 20% is comprised of commissions earned on insurance sales as well as trust earnings. A unique aspect of this business model is that they sell pre-need funeral/cemetery services up-front, which last in a trust for about 3-5 years. This is sort of like an insurance float and the Company can invest it. What concerns me is that their investment style is fairly aggressive for a trust under an RIA - corporate bonds are a large % of the portfolio - again, not shocking given the CEOs background (and a good # of their analysts I could find on LinkedIn have HY backgrounds) a little more than a year ago, their bond portfolio was quoted at 80%. 

But my gut instinct is that these death care operations are not as profitable as they come off due to the interesting composition of their revenue/earnings stream. 

I mean, its almost like you're not really buying a death care operator. You're buying a Public LBO and RIA. So you're really counting on 1) the ability to continue closing accretive M&A  (and the larger you get, the harder this becomes) and 2) the ability of the RIA to continue performing well. 

But where I'm stuck is that LTM FCF is about $22mn - 2x interest coverage. I haven't done enough work to figure out what the cash flow margin on insurance commissions/trust earnings are, but I suspect it is a high % of FCF. If that business faltered they'd be in trouble. Again, also in trouble if M&A dries up. 

Bonds all have maturities out to 2021 and trade at 2-3% yields, and since I can't really think of a good reason why FCF will actually materially decline I have no reason to short them. But I also can't really think of a good reason to short the equity. 

I suppose I just feel like this Company is full of shit and there isn't anything I can do about it. ",8,0.79,1508957563,"[['CSV', 3], ['FCF', 2], ['HY', 1]]",CSV,23.600000381469727,26.059999465942383

I own shares in a couple companies that are fundamentally sound from a financial and business model perspective, but I wanted to get a deeper look into things that might not be reflected in a 10-K. I looked on Glassdoor for reviews and was somewhat concerned:

Company A - More of a deep value play (a shipping company trading really cheap)

Reviews did not look great. It seemed like a very cutthroat culture and people were upset about low pay and favouritism regarding promotions. Obviously I wasn't particularly happy with this.

Company B - More of a Warren Buffett than Ben Graham situation (technology research company with a solid moat, 30% average ROE, huge growth potential and trading slightly cheap even when growth is not considered)

t3_7bazjq,CNX Spinoff (CEIX) [Long Thesis],"CNX is a gas and coal company that’s spinning off it’s coal business. Management indicated that they wanted out of coal. I think most of the institutional shareholders want out of the coal business as well. Clean energy has been coming down significantly in price, and coal is simply dirty. Right now, all the stock is owned by institutional owners, and I’m willing to bet they all see CNX as a gas company. In addition, CEIX will pay CNX $450 million, and they’ll source these funds by taking on debt. 

CEIX’s coal business is a low-cost producer, and so they are positioned to benefit relative to the rest of the industry as prices are cut. While coal use has been decreasing, conservative estimates have 25% of US energy needs being met by coal by 2025. It’s decreasing, but coal is not going away. As a result of the pessimism, the valuation of this business is depressed.

Greenlight capital did a presentation on CNX that you can find readily online, and part of that presentation includes a DCF valuation for the coal aspect of the business. Their assumptions for the DCF still hold true, as they’ve used conservative estimates for coal use projections, and what that means for prices. They’ve assumed a spot price per tonne of coal at $50/tonne, increasing to $55/tonne by 2025. The current spot price is $57 (much higher than the values used in their DCF), and it’s likely because of a squeezed supply, since a lot of coal companies have gone out of business. Assigning the conservative price to project out revenue, they’ve assigned a value of $3B to the Thermal Coal business, and $0.5B to the Metallurgic Coal business.

The Spin Off

For every 8 shares of CNX you have, you receive 1 share of CEIX (the CoalCo spinoff company). 

The CFO of CNX was apparently deeply involved in the orchestration of this spin off, and he will be the new CFO of CEIX. In addition, CNXC, which holds approximately 10% of CEIX’s mines is currently valued at a market cap of $394.7M. That implies a $3.9B market cap for just the mine assets of CEIX (since they own the rest).

I think CEIX will be oversold by institutional owners who want in on a gas company because gas prices are projected to keep going up, and to take away from oil.

I also believe the structure of giving 1 share of CoalCo for every 8 shares of ParentCo, while keeping the number of shares to around 28 million might be to ensure the intrinsic value of the stock price would be high. If the stock were to be fairly valued right off the bat, it would create a “sticker shock” kind of effect that would initially discourage ownership. This means the stock likely won’t be at fair value initially. A depressed initial valuation would benefit management – they haven’t set compensation plans yet, but would be able to cite a lower stock price for the strike price of any options.

Their compensation plan will probably be similar to the compensation plan set for 2016 by CNX. The Long-Term Incentive Compensation was set to be linked to the Relative Total Return to Shareholders (TRS) vs the S&P 500 (50% of additional compensation), and the Absolute Stock Price (the other 50% of additional compensation). 

Finally, CEIX has reserved 2,600,000 shares for employee compensation. Since the total number of shares available will be 28,000,000, this means that a little over 9% of all shares will be reserved for employee compensation. This seems like quite a bit, and management should be aligned with shareholders in that respect. 

The Idea 

Wait until CEIX starts trading on Nov 29th, 2017, and buy in when it’s experiencing selling pressure. 

Side Note: I'm new to this, so if you can mention things I've missed, or tear me a new one, please do so.

Okay, so the interesting thing here is the WACC ends up actually being lower than the WACC calculated by Greenlight. I made the assumption that their interest payments would decrease over 20 years to a quarter of what they will be initially to account for their changing capital structure as they delever. I realize this isn't perfect because it involves a lot of assumptions, but the alternative view is they maintain the same levered capital structure until the mines shut down. 

In any case, once you subtract out the interest payments, and use the updated WACC that accounts for the riskiness in the leveraged capital structure, I got a PV of $3.05B for the Thermal Coal business… but then I updated the DCF for the price of coal they're currently getting (it's not actually $57 - it's $45. Huge oversight on my part). 

It drops the valuation like a stone, but it still may be undervalued once it starts trading. **My assumption here is coal will still hit 55 and stay there by 2025, so I plugged in a smooth increase until that point. I feel like this is important, because a levered coal company that has interest payments would lose money over time if the price didn't go up.** That being said, I also believe it's a reasonable assumption because CEIX is still a cost-leader, and there's not many companies that can survive these prices for long. Sans interest payments, they're in one of the best positions to weather the storm. 

I got a value of $1.9B for the Thermal Coal. I haven't valued the met coal, or the port, and this value only takes into account the guaranteed 700ish million tons that should last about 25 years (there is potentially more, but I'm trying to be conservative). So we'll find out what happens once it starts trading I guess.

t3_7bis15,BBX Capital (NYSE:BBX) - Long Thesis,"On October 23, 2017, BBX Capital (NYSE:BBX) filed a registration statement with the SEC relating to a possible IPO of Bluegreen, the company's wholly-owned vacation ownership or timeshare subsidiary. This would be a very positive development and help to highlight the undervaluation of BBX Capital. BBX is currently trading at $8.79 per share and we think Bluegreen alone is worth $13-$14 per BBX Capital share. The IPO will help to illustrate this value.  

Management appear to be wisely seeking to take advantage of a favourable window of opportunity to list Bluegreen with the share prices of the major competitors (Marriot Vacations (VAC), Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) and ILG (ILG)) up 55% - 65% YTD. These comps now trade on trailing EBITDA multiples of 15.7x, 12.9x and 14.3x respectively.

The IPO registration document shows total outstanding shares after the IPO of 74.7m which, at the mid-point of $17 per share, gives an equity value for Bluegreen of about $1,270m. This equals $12.45 per BBX Capital share or 42% above today's closing price of $8.79.
There is also roughly $2 .00 per share of various real estate assets offset by $0.40 per share of net debt at the holdco that are unrelated to Bluegreen. There are also some net operating losses that will further add to value. This gives a combined value of roughly $13-14 per share for BBX Capital compared to the current price of $8.79 per share or 50% upside. 
Management appears to be taking advantage of strong current trading at Bluegreen and an equity market that has recently re-rated the industry materially. So, hopefully we now have a very near term catalyst to reveal value if management press ahead with the IPO as soon as possible.

The underlying industry of Bluegreen, vacation ownership interests or timeshares, has gone through substantial change over the past decade. The industry has evolved from a capital-heavy, developer-oriented market plagued by bankruptcies and aggressive sales tactics to a much more capital light model involving generally reputable firms such as Starwood, Hilton, Wyndham and Marriot (although still fairly aggressive sales tactics). These companies have spun off these businesses over the past several years and there has been a lot of consolidation in the industry over recent years. This year has seen a dramatic increase in the market value of vacation ownership companies (+55-65% YTD) as they are growing very strongly and earn extraordinary returns on invested capital.

I'd like to know what structures you are all using or seeing to split profits between GP and LPs. 

I don't like charging management fees, only performance, but, how should I approach expenses related to partnership maintenance, like bookkeeping, and accounting? 

I would probably pay my analyst and asset management staff out of my performance, is this commonly done? 

My two leading ideas are to offer:
4% guaranteed return, then 50/50. (this is like buffetts structure, but again, what expenses am I able to include as a partnership expense vs coming out of my performance bonus?) (A 15% return would be split  9.5% LP 5.5% GP) 

Or, a 60/40 split, the investor earns a preferred return, then I catch-up until my performance split. (a 15% return would be split 9% LP 6% GP) 

The first model benefits me more if make exceptional returns. 

These are mainly personal preferences, but the big question again is how to handle my management expenses, thoughts? (Office (I work at home), staff, CPA, travel expenses related to due diligence or asset management). 

My proud self would prefer to pay for everything myself, but ask for a maximum profit split. But my conservative colleagues suggest charging everything to the partnership, but then I can't justify the same % split.

t3_7d1xz9,advice for a new PM? interested in hearing how you structure your day and deal with the emotional aspect of the job,"Hi guys,

I want to switch gears from the usual topics posted in this sub (i.e. direct investment related) and talk about the actual job.

I started a PM job about 6 months ago. Long story short, I'm managing a mid-7 figure portfolio (starting off...with more capital allocated to me if I do well) for a privately-owned insurance company. They have never invested in a fund, but are helping me build a track record within the firm with the hope of funding me to go out on my own in the future (hedge fund).

I wanted to pick your brains here, especially those who have been/are PM's, regarding 2 things.

&nbsp;

******************************************************
**First**, how do you structure your day? I am trying to become more process-oriented as opposed to goal-oriented in the sense of building routines and habits, so that I can chip away at all my work on a consistent basis. I've fond that since I've started this new job, my work output/productivity tends to fluctuate with my emotional mood/motivation. When I feel good, I get a lot done. When I don't feel good, I basically drag things out forever. 

I want to eliminate this dependency, at least to a sense where I've developed habits/systems that allow me to get work done on a daily basis.

What I'm curious about is for example - do you do your analysis related work (reading a company's filings, etc.) in the mornings? I am trying to read less news in the middle of the day and put stuff like that off till later in the day or night when I'm already tired. For example, you don't need to be mentally fresh to read WSJ. I'd rather spend those hours doing things that require critical thinking.

As an example, here are the things I'd like to get done on a daily/weekly basis:

&nbsp;

*Investing:*

* watch existing positions

* work on ideas in “pipeline”

* check various sources on daily/weekly basis to add new ideas to pipeline

* keep up with general news (macro)

* read various investment blogs I subscribe to that talk about either ideas or investing in general

&nbsp;

*Mental Development/Skill Sharpening:*

* read business history book / maybe take notes

* read biography book (Rockefeller, JP Morgan, Sam Zell, etc.) / maybe take notes

* read investing-related books that discuss various frameworks

&nbsp;

I'm struggling to find a way to set up a daily routine where I can take a whack at a few of these on a daily basis.

&nbsp;

******************************************************
**Second**, I've also found that since starting this PM job, I am watching my Bloomberg Terminal way more than I would like to and getting sort of mentally distracted by day-to-day price fluctuations. Part of it is the emotional aspect of being a PM (i.e. other people have entrusted their capital to you), but the other part is that I'm being given a big opportunity here, and I don't want to blow it.

&nbsp;

When you started off as a PM or as you look back on your career, how did you learn to not let your portfolio performance affect your mood/self-esteem? I'm finding that I'm taking that self-esteem hit home with me, which isn't as big an issue since I'm in my mid to late 20's and not married. But it's something I would like to overcome as soon as possible. Maybe it's just something that will take time and part of the ""growing pains"" of a PM role? I've only been in it since May, so perhaps it will just take more time.

&nbsp;

I feel like these are both some underrated aspects of a ""money manager"" role that deserve more attention.

Would love to hear any thoughts/advice/feedback you could provide

t3_7dlngn,Friday Discussion - 'Flash Point' Investing and Negative Media Situations,"Happy Friday! 

  I wanted to start a discussion on investing during 'flash points' - or when a company's stock price rapidly moves (often negatively) as it is subject to negative or positive media exposure. While this is certainly not a novel approach, in my opinion, the proliferation of near-instantaneous media creates more pricing mismatches as negative information is released immediately, and then stocks are re-priced to reflect economic reality over the coming hours, days, weeks, and months. 

  I've found it's not useful **independently** as a tool for finding undervalued securities (except in rare cases), but rather as an additional consideration for bringing ideas you've already researched within your margin of safety. 

  Again, to some, this may sound like a value trap or an attempt to dress up your dogs, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. Anecdotally, I've been pulling the trigger on ~10% or one out of every dozen-or-so 'flash point' situations. It's been incredibly helpful in rounding out my personal investing skillset to non-traditional or special situations (e.g. estimating legal risk re: settlement sizes). As both a caveat and a bonus, I've also found it to be a good gauge of one's own competencies or lack thereof in analyzing the causes and second-order causes of pricing mismatches (i.e. fundamental vs. ephemeral changes in the business). 

  A few examples of 'flashpoints' that have popped up on my radar over the past 24 months: 
  
  - EA post Star Wars BF2 microtransaction debacle  
  
  - Equifax post data breach 
  
  - Walmart + other retailers post Amazon-Whole Foods acquisition 
  
  - Mid major E&P's in early 2016
  
  - UAL post doctor-beating debacle 
  
  - WFC post unauthorized accounts-gate

  - Valeant ('nuff said)

t3_7fkvu1,OPINION: Further Upside for Constellation Brands,"Constellation Brands (STZ) is a Fortune 500® company and a leading international producer and marketer of beer, wine and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, New Zealand and Italy. Constellation is the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the U.S. market. The company’s high-end, iconic imported brands include Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Pacifico. The portfolio also includes Ballast Point, one of the most awarded craft brewers in the U.S. In addition, Constellation is the world’s leader in premium wine, selling great brands including Robert Mondavi, Clos du Bois, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Mark West, Franciscan Estate, Ruffino and The Prisoner. The company’s premium spirits brands include SVEDKA Vodka, Casa Noble Tequila and High West Whiskey.

The company’s fundamentals are strong! As of the most recent quarter, the company’s market cap is $42.57 billion with a forward P/E ratio of 23.57 (A good sign; level P/E ratios common in mature industries like this; Beta of -0.01) compared to an alcoholic beverage sector average of 23.27 and an S&P 500 average of 23.28. Their revenue amount to $7.46 Billion. Organic net sales rose 8% to $2.07 Billion, beer segment sales increase 12.8% to 1.38 Billion, wine and spirits sales fell 11.7% to 705.6 Million, and they improved adjusted earnings guidance to $8.25-$8.40 per share from $7.90-$8.10. This is their 12th straight earnings beat and 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement (40% increase at $2.47 per share). So how does STZ square up to competitors? For this analysis, I will be looking at Constellation Brands (STZ), Diageo (DEO), Brown-Foreman (BF-B), Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), and The Boston Beer Company (SAM). I will also very briefly mention Campari (CPR-MI), Remy Cointreau (RCO-PA), and Pernod Ricard (RI-PA) for further comparison within the industry.

Constellation Brands is most efficient in its operations, effective in management, and consistent in performance. Let’s first look at each company’s revenue per employee (independent variable) and operating margin (dependent variable) …

STZ: Revenue per Employee - $828,418 Feb 28, 2017 (Operating Margin = 33.76% August 31st, 2017)
DEO: Revenue per Employee - $489,858 June 30, 2017 (Operating Margin = 29.50% June 30th, 2017)
BF-B: Revenue per Employee - $630315 April 30, 2017 (Operating Margin = 33.34% July 31st, 2017)
TAP: Revenue per Employee - $368679 December 31, 2016 (Operating Margin = 36.60% September 30, 2017)
BUD: Revenue per Employee - $258,383 December 31, 2016 (Operating Margin = 28.92% September 30, 2017)
SAM: Revenue per Employee - $617,890 December 31, 2016 (Operating Margin = 15.43% September 30, 2017)

Source: Y Charts


Although TAP’s operating margin is superior to the rest of its competitors with data given so far, STZ maintains the lead in terms of superior operating margins in correlation with revenue per employee (BF-B comes close but revenue per employee falls short while SAM’s operating margin is the worst in comparison even though revenue per employee is close to that of BF-B). This illustrates that STZ’s labor and operations efficiency is the highest. It is worth noting that operating margins for Campari, Remy Cointreau, and Pernod Ricard also fall short of STZ and even that of BF-B so these are not in consideration (especially taking into account that they trade on European Stock Exchanges and are subject to currency exchange risk; DEO is subject to these risks as well but the security is traded on US stock exchanges).  

Let’s now look at revenue and earnings of each company…

Constellation Brands (STZ)
2015 - Revenue: 6.03 Billion, Earnings: 839.30 Million

2015: Revenue: 43.60 Billion, Earnings: 8.27 Billion

2015: Revenue: 959.93 Million, Earnings: 98.41 Million
2016: Revenue: 906.45 Million, Earnings: 87.35 Million

The only company to maintain a consecutive uptrend in BOTH revenues and earnings is STZ. In fact, in the past five years, STZ's stock price has failed to increase, per quarter, only three times. TAP is the only company on the list that ends up at a higher revenue and earnings level compared to the first year but considering that it has no consecutive earnings beats compared to STZ whose beat earnings 12 times in a row, consistency comes into question. 

Finally, let’s look at 5-year stock performance…

STZ: 518.39%
DEO: 16.94%
BF-B: 67.68%
BUD: 33.64%
TAP: 92.16%
SAM: 57.30%
RI-PA: 48.92%

Source: Y Charts


Evidently, Constellation continues to outperform all its competitors for the past five years and beyond. Many comparisons between STZ have been made against DEO and BF-B but from the data above, DEO seems to be sluggish and inefficient based on its operating margins and revenue per employee while BF-B, although a close contender, lacks consistency in performance (BF-B's stock price has fallen eight times in a quarter-to-quarter comparison in the past five years). But what could explain STZ’s superior performance and growth?

Looking at the 10-year chart, STZ (excluding SAM) breaks out from the rest of the companies in comparison around 2013 with the pace quickening near the end of the 1st half of the year. Around that time, the company completed its acquisition of Grupo Modelo’s U.S. Beer Business from Anheuser-Busch InBev for approximately $4.75 Billion. The acquisition nearly doubled company sales and significantly increased EBIT alongside free cash flow, helping solidify Constellation's position as the #1 multi-category supplier for beer, wine and spirits in the U.S. at the time of the acquisition. Furthermore, Constellation entered the tequila game early with its acquisition of Casa Noble Tequila in 2014 for only $30 Million. Compare this with DEO’s later acquisition of George Clooney’s Casamigos Tequila brand (respectable brand but not on the level of Casa Noble and a little late not to mention expensive; makes STZ’s tequila play a massive bargain in comparison) for approximately $1 Billion earlier this year and one can see why STZ is where it is now. These are arguably pivotal moments in the company’s history as their blockbuster Corona franchise is America’s best-selling premium import and the company alone was responsible for the 60% of the growth in the high-end beer category last quarter (this segment expanded by 9% over the past six months). Furthermore, Modelo, not Corona, led the beer portfolio higher by posting a 20% spike in consumption for the last quarter.

There is reason for concern when considering their wine and spirits segments, however, and recent acquisitions in the craft beer space. According to the company, wine and spirits sales fell 11.7% to 705.6 Million which is worrying especially considering the company’s recent acquisitions of Charles Smith and Prisoner wine brands. These acquisitions are further put into question with the acquisition of Ballast Point in 2015 for $1 Billion and expansion into craft beers (to make matters worse, the company alongside others making similar moves such as BUD are facing negative sentiment from the craft beer community). For example, after BUD’s purchase of Wicked Weed Brewing, many brewpubs and craft beer festivals cut ties. Furthermore, negative trends in the craft beer space led STZ to take a $86.8 Million impairment charge on the Ballast Point’s trademark value to $136 Million and the need to further write down the value more and more could grow. In other words, it looks like the company overpaid for Ballast Point, especially considering that the acquisition of Grupo Modelo only a few years ago cost approximately $4.75 Billion and the return on that investment has proven life-changing for STZ. However, despite these facts, the fact that Charles Smith alongside other new brand launches including Buddha Funky Brewery, acquired this past August, helped contribute to the most recent earnings beat and raised the bottom line is encouraging. Regarding their acquisitions in the craft beer space, although the price tag for Ballast was a little high, the move marks STZ’s overall strides to expand their presence in the high-end beer market and although their focus should be more on Corona, etc., this seems to have been a necessary move. Acquisitions to fuel strategic growth is a strong characteristic of the company and so far, they have been making the right moves for the most part and will do so going forward. But what is there to prove that they are making the right moves? Their debt-management. 

A major concern for the company is their debt load and just recently, STZ priced in $2 billion in new debt as of Oct 31st, 2017 which closed on November 7th. So evidently, debt-management comes into question. Okay, so at first glance the debt situation looks bad but let's dig a little deeper...

So, although STZ's debt is rising, their debt-to-equity ratio is decreasing. Back in 2015 around the beginning of the second half, it was about 1.224 and now it's resting at about 1.129. In short, their equity is rising faster than their debt can keep pace and instead of focusing on dividends and distributions back to shareholders, they're keeping profits on the balance sheet. And their management under Rob Sands is excellent so these profits are getting reinvested to fuel smart and strategic expansion of potential economic profits. The style of debt they're using is old-fashioned, but it is working for them. The share price is a testament to this superb management and a result of the company putting its profits to work. Take another look below…

2015: Net Margin % - 13.92% | Financial Leverage - 2.62 | Return on Equity 15.61%
2016: Net Margin % - 16.11% | Financial Leverage - 2.59 | Return on Equity 17.11%
2017: Net Margin % - 20.94% | Financial Leverage - 2.70 | Return on Equity 22.83%

Source: Edgar Online Database


The reason for the overwhelming rise in equity is due to improving net income margins. While many companies are achieving this at the expense of increasing leverage and thereby risk, STZ has made improvements in the right areas. According to the data above, financial leverage for STZ increased by just 3% in three years and was not a significant contributor to the increase in return on equity. Compare this with its peers and STZ’s results look even more impressive. For instance, in the case of Anheuser-Busch (BUD), the return on equities has dipped despite an increase in leverage and risk. Therefore, excess returns from higher return on equity with minimal increases in risk (leverage), when peers are failing to do that, should support further expansion in STZ's earnings multiple. So, knowing the story behind this debt alleviates any concern regarding the company’s debt and, in fact, recent news of more debt is encouraging with management intact.

Now that the case for STZ against its competitors is made, let’s evaluate the intrinsic value of the company. For this analysis, a discount rate of 8.49%

The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm). Note the market value of equity is used not the book value ($43,044,787,154).

Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))
0.608 = 0.531 (1 + (1- 30%) (20.79%))
Levered Beta used in calculation = 0.8


It is important to note that any type of DCF calculation is subject to significant variance depending on discount rate and growth rate. The discount rate is based on the cost of equity since the perspective is from the viewpoint of a potential investor so cost of capital (Weighed Average Cost of Capital/WACC), which accounts for debt, is not used. So clearly the intrinsic value is not up to par with my bull thesis of the stock. In fact, for the past two years I’ve been analyzing the stock, the DCF model has concluded STZ is overvalued yet the stock has continued to climb. I believe this is the case because DCF is a highly quantitative technique and therefore does not fully reflect changes in non-financial information. The company is simply making too many moves that the valuation can never keep up and full current potential is not being realized. So, what does the company have going for itself moving forward that is justifying further upside?

First, CEO Rob Sands makes it clear in the most recent earnings call that distribution growth is anything but at its highest potential due to retailors dedicating too much shelf space to low-margin, low-growth brands. Evidently, the velocity on STZ products are much higher than its competitors in terms of the high-end beer market and therefore the point Sands made in the call was that retailers are beginning to assign more shelf space to Constellation’s portfolio as they realize higher margins and growth can be unlocked, benefiting both sides. With that said, the full potential of STZ is yet to be realized implying further growth ahead.

Second, the company is beginning to reap the financial benefits from its multiyear investments aimed toward boosting Mexican brewery capacity and added efficiency to its glass production, spending which peaks over $1 Billion this year, as part of an $4-billion-plus total investment. Capital spending should slow significantly from here, though. Constellation Brands is expecting over $1 billion in annual free cash flow beginning next year, compared to the $775 million it expects to generate in fiscal 2017. That will result in larger amounts of free cash flow that can be directed toward bigger beer and wine brand acquisitions, accelerated share repurchases, and a rising dividend. This increase in growth and repurchasing of shares should point further upside while attracting more equity as the stock brings in more income investors with a higher dividend. 

Third, STZ announced plans to debut its newest additions to the Corona franchise this upcoming February: Corona Premier (domestic markets) and Familiar (all major Hispanic markets). This is an excellent move for two reasons: 1) 66% of net sales consisted of beer segment sales which increased 12.8% to 1.38 Billion with Mexican beers leading the charge behind this massive growth and therefore makes the focus on Mexican beers like Corona paramount, and 2) the company states that 55% to 60% of all beer sales occur during the first half of the year so the fact that the new beers will debut near the beginning of the first half is optimal. With the Corona franchise already exceeding expectations and test markets showing approval so far, expect further growth and dominance in the high-end beer market, arguably their strongest segment.

Fourth, a recent 9.9% stake purchase (~$195 million) in Canopy, a world-leading provider of medical marijuana is another effective and early move reminiscent of STZ’s moves into the high-end beer market through the Grupo Modelo acquisition and tequila through Casa Noble. Both those acquisitions have paid off immensely and no doubt this move into the weed industry will prove successful as well. And although this initial investment may seem small, the company has options to buy more shares at a later time. This move comes at a time when approximately 27% of beer drinkers have already substituted beer with cannabis while BUD and TAP are already trying to secure sole licensing rights in Nevada to distribute cannabis. The move by Constellation therefore is clearly an effort to secure Canadian distribution before legislation is passed requiring cannabis be sold and purchased through a government licensed distributor which would cost significantly more. But legalization is the trend with recreational marijuana already legalized seven states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Washington) alongside Washington, D.C. Increased legalization of recreational marijuana will equate to lower beer and spirits sales, so this is a smart move. The question of legalization is not “If” but “When” and soon, many if not all, of the other states will follow and the cannabis market is expected to hit a lofty $50 billion by 2026, according to Cowen. More importantly, Constellation is going to work with Canopy Growth to develop cannabis-based drinks for its customers who already purchase wine, beer and spirits made by the company. In states like Colorado where recreational use is legal, cannabis-based drinks are booming. By working with Canopy Growth, Constellation goes from a triple threat (beer, wine, spirits) to a quadruple threat. This investment should continue to fuel STZ’s growth as it enters a potentially explosive market in the coming years.

Finally, Senate Republicans are proposing significant excise tax reductions for wine, liquor, and beer. Only downside is it would only last two years, so the Republicans are proposing extensions (Would begin December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2019). This would be the first distilled spirits tax reduction since the Civil War if approved. Some examples of how reductions would work (Potential $130 million generated from this throughout the industry, will be reinvested back into businesses which is good for investors) …

Beer: $16/barrel – First 2,000,000 barrels, $18/barrel - 2,000,000+

Small brewers: $3.50/barrel - First 60,000 barrels, $16/barrel - 60,000+ 

Spirits: $2.70/gallon – First 100,000 gallons, $13.34/gallon – between 100,000 and 22,130,000 gallons, $13.50/gallon - 22,130,000+

Wines: $1.07/gallon -14% alcohol content, stronger wines increase with alcohol content, $13.50/gallon - 24% alcohol content (Sparkling wine at $3.40/gallon)
Increases lowest taxable increment of wine from 14% to 16% (Sparkling wine will be taxed in line with still wines)

Reduce Excise Taxes: $1/gallon – First 30,000 gallons (produced or imported), 90 cents/gallon - next 100,000 gallons, 53.5 cents/gallon - next 620,000 gallons

Source: CNN Money

Although this is more speculative and there is no guarantee that this proposal goes through, if these tax reductions are realized then the potential for additional upside would increase as this is not necessarily priced into the stock itself. To put this into perspective, STZ paid approximately $730.1 Million in excise taxes for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 so any savings that can be realized from excise taxes would be a boon to not only STZ but the alcoholic beverages industry. But under superior management and efficiency in operations, this tax relief should be of more benefit to STZ than its peers. 

I will not provide a price target as such is not in my nature to do so. And statistically, this stock would not count as an undervalued security as the relevant P/E and P/BV are not below 15 and 1.5, respectively. Furthermore, the DCF model shows that STZ is overvalued but considering all points mentioned and that the stock has continued to steadily rise over the years above its peers, I am expecting further upside fueled by its promising future growth prospects.

t3_7hkl10,Query regarding page 456 of 'The Intelligent Investor',"Hello,

On page 456 of 'The Intelligent Investor' (Revised 1973 edition) Benjamin Graham is comparing H & R Block to Blue Bell as they were at the end of 1969. He says that Blue Bell was earning 2.5 times as much for its stock and that it had 5.5 times as much in tangible investment. 

I am confused as to how he gets these amounts. I calculated that H & R Block's EPS for the year was $6,380,000/5,426,000 (earnings for the year over the number of shares) = $1.18, whilst Blue Bell's EPS is given as $4.47 in table 18-4, which is 
3.79 times as much rather than 2.5 times (I don't know why H & R Block's EPS is given in the table as only up to October, where it is $0.51).

I assume 'tangible investment' refers to tangible assets rather than total book value. Blue Bell has 18.28 times as much book value per share ($34.54 compared to $1.89), but the tangible assets are not listed in the table so they cannot be compared by the reader.

t3_7hznbl,Updated Berkshire Valuation (@ new corp tax rate),"With Berkshire set to benefit a lot from the new corp tax rate, and a run up in the company's stock portfolio, I thought it might be interesting to revisit the valuation I posted a few months back. The stock is ~$198/share, so here's a quick breakdown of both sides of the Berkshire business: the cash and investments, and the wholly-owned operating subsidies. 

**1. Value of Cash & Investments**

* $66/share stocks
* $36/share cash (after taking out $20b for dry powder)
* $12/share KHC (marked to market)
* $11/share fixed income
* $1/share Pfds/Warrants
* *less* $10/share deferred tax (new rate)

= **$117/share book**

**2. Value of Operating Businesses** = $198 (current price) - $117 (cash & investments) = **$81/share**

* 2016 Earnings operating businesses earned $8.50, so implied multiple on the operating businesses is 9.5x. 
* This seems low, and I think it deserves a higher multiple, which in and of itself would give us a ~15% discount to current prices. 
* Then factor in if you think BRK will benefit further from lower taxes not just at their operating businesses, but also with their stock holdings. AAPL, WFC, BAC, AXP in particular will benefit. And then do you think the portfolio has more room to run? Berkshire's stock portfolio trades at 19x earnings, whereas the S&P is at 25. Maybe this says more about the market's valuation than Berkshire's, but I certainly wouldn't say Berkshire's stock portfolio is overvalued.

They beat quarterly revenue and earnings expectations, and EBITDA/ EBIT even increased -- EPS decreased compared to the prior year because they had to pay a higher tax rate.

1) The backlog has dropped by half over the past year and they haven't added any significant projects. However, they still have 500 million$ in contracts left and aren't expected to be done by mid-late 2018. Additionally industry conditions are pretty strong, so this seems like a bit of an overreaction. 

2) Negative FCF for this quarter -- this is because of how the payments work and the fact that they collect cash payments before a job, but only record the earnings in the quarter where they collect. Again, this is plausible but doesn't seem like a reasonable explanation.

In the CAPM/APT models: E(R) = Risk Free + ∑ Beta(s) * Risk Premium(s).

There's no specific risk since as investors, we're supposed to have diversified portfolio which should reduce (or ultimately eliminate) the specific risk factors.

Okay, I get the logic here. But when we do a research on a company for a potential stock investment, what we really trying to do is finding the competitive advantages that separate this particular firm to the rest. These differences, to me, are that specific factor in the CAPM/APT models.
 1. So if we apply the CAPM/APT in the Cost of Equity model to obtain the final Cost of Capital, we're just supposed to ignore totally that crucial aspect of the firm? What's the point of identifying the ""X factors"" in that situation other than to forecast growth/Cash Flows?

I strumbled upon Tix Corporation in one of my recent screens. For many years pre-crisis they did not earn a net income. Since 2012 that changed for the better - or at least positive territory. This company sells tickets on discount for same-day shows and restaurants in Las Vegas. Current market cap is 6.2 mUSD.

As of 3Q 2017 they had 5,844,000 in current assets, mostly cash. Office equipment, furniture and lease improvements totaled 3,792,000 before depreciation in the 2016 annual report. And they had a Deferred Tax Asset of 10,220,000 hence allowing them to lower future tax payments. On the liability side is mostly current liabilities of 1,701,000 and a Deferred rent obligations of 17,000.

A back of the enveloped a 50 % discount to PP&E, taking cash at face value and liabilities at face value while applying a 15 % discount rate to the tax asset to estimate present value yields a estimated reproduction value-based NAV of 14,925,956 USD. It is hence selling at a discount of around 58 to reproduction value as defined by Calandros wonderful book ""Applied Value Investing"".

In April 2015 they decided to pay regular quarterly dividend, which seemed to have been ""left out"" in the third quarter. MGM Resorts International decided in the third quarter to open their own booth and hence Tix cannot sell tickets for the Cirque du Soleil. They recently launched a online platform to mitigate the decrease in tickets sold. They seem keen on utilizing the NOL and realize the value of it. 

Is it overlooked because bigger investors have difficulties in establishing a meaningful allocation and hence the value not ""corrected""? This is from their annual report ""In general,
an ownership change would occur if the Company’s ""5-percent shareholders,"" as defined under Section 382, collectively increase their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period."".

* ROIC - 43.17 (industry median is 13.48)

* No debt

* Price to cash is relatively low (14.2)

Their company headquarters is in Houston, TX and Hurricane Harvey shut them down for a solid 2 weeks in Q3 (including their E-commerce distribution). There has been high turnover in management over the years and they seem to be having difficulty with their product line this year. 

I do like the current CEO though. He seems very honest about the situation and is accepting blame for the company's failures. I really like that he is consolidating the store's product line in order to focus more on their core customer (women in their 20s).

t3_7qdmkt,Why Mortgage REITs Are Getting Clobbered?,"So I wanted to compile some data to help illustrate what is going on in the market that is resulting in mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts getting clobbered. 

For this particular analysis, I am focusing on [ORC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORC/). They recently announced a cut to the monthly dividend from 14cents a share per month to 11cents a share per month and the book value has gone down to $7.87. 

 That said, they have 44% of their market value in cash ($178.53 million). 

The past year has not been kind to buyers of MBS such as mortgage REITs like ORC. 

[ORC MBS Portfolio Characteristics](https://imgur.com/a/OIjuY)

As you can see from the image above:

Currently, ORC has a MBS portfolio of $4.36billion. The majority (67%) of their portfolio is in 30 year fixed rate MBS at $2.9billion. 

Of their $4.36billion portfolio, 59% of their portfolio is invested in Fannie Mae which is about $2.2billion. The other 39% is invested in Freddie Mac which is about $1.5billion. 

Before I continue, I want to explain how bond prices and yields work - typically bond prices and the yield of interest rates are inverse related. As bond prices drop, the interest rate yield (not the coupon interest rate) goes up and vice-a-versa. 

This information is important to know as next we are going to look at the 30 year mortgage interest rate for the past year.

As you can see from this chart, in March 2017 the 30 year interest rate peaked at 4.33% and finished 2017 at 3.99% (it started 2017 at 4.09%). 

Given that the interest rate  virtually ended 2017 where it started, you'd expect the MBS prices to reflect this but they don't. In the following image, [Fannie Mae 30 Year 4.0 coupon](https://imgur.com/a/XvgYW) we can see that the price of the 30 year bond for Fannie Mae actually ended 2017 lower than it started. At the start of 2017, the bond price was at 105.33 but ended 2017 at 103.90. That is a price difference of 1.43. 

We also can see this when we look at the [Freddie Mac 30 year 4.0 coupon](https://imgur.com/a/Xkfv0). Here we can see that at the start of 2017, the price was at 105.19 but ended 2017 at 103.90. That is a price difference of 1.29. 

For the 30 year bond prices to be at 103.90, we would expect the 30 year mortgage interest rate to be at minimum 4.2% to 4.3%. Not 3.99%. 

The other factor that plays into all of this is the [Federal Reserve Funds Rate](https://imgur.com/a/XvgYW), here we can see that the Federal Reserve Funds rate started 2017 at .56% but ended 2017 at 1.3%. 

How does this impact mortgage REITs? 

Mortgage REIT's make money through the spread of borrowing money and the interest rate yield of the MBS they've invested in, when that spread narrows - it makes it harder for them to make money. As the spread grows, it gets easier for them to make money. Mortgage REIT's do engage in hedging via interest rate futures to help protect the downside.

My thoughts on the future: 

Something has to change, either bond prices go back up to reflect the interest rate yield or the interest rate yield goes up to reflect the bond prices. As soon as either one happens, mortgage REITs like ORC will stop being squeezed by the narrowing of the spread and will recover. Of course no one knows how long the current divergence will last.  

Disclosure: I am long ORC, I am a buy and hold investor compounding the dividends.  ",29,0.91,1515954988,"[['ORC', 2]]",ORC,7.800000190734863,8.149999618530273
t3_7qkivm,On the false dichotomy of growth vs value,"Is anyone else annoyed by the growth vs value framework?

All investing is 'value' investing. If you are not value investing you are speculating (nothing wrong with that, mind you).

The most seemingly 'expensive' companies relative to the broader market can still be dramatically underpriced (google, facebook, amazon, etc). 

Conversely, companies which seem 'cheap' relative to the broader market can often still be dramatically overpriced.

All profitable investing comes down to paying up less than NPV.

In order to form a good idea about the NPV you need to be making qualitative assessments about the *future* strength and prospects of the business.

A lot of these so called value investors with poor track records imo spend too much time analyzing past financial statements and looking backward than they do making assessments about where the business is actually going, i.e. skating to where the puck is currently instead of where it is going to land.

In other words, they are making the old mistake of prefering to pay a 'cheap' price for a mediocre (deteriorating) business instead of a 'fair' price for an exceptional (growing) business.

t3_7rsspj,Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) worth the wildfire risk?,"PG&E's shares are down ~37% over the past 3 months. Catalysts include concerns raised in October that the company may be liable for the recent northern California wildfires and management's subsequent decision to suspend their dividend while the smoke clears.

High-end estimates for the damages are in the $13B range and the company has $800 million in insurance coverage. Not an expert but I think PG&E makes for a great long term investment, the stock is oversold, and the company will get though the firestorm. I just started buying shares at $44.50. Interested to get some feedback on this. Pardon the puns.

Overview:
- P/B: 1.2 (5yr average: 1.6)
- P/E: 10.2 (5 yr average: 24.6)
- Gross Margin: 70% (10 yr high)
- Operating margin: 20% (10 yr high)
- Solid top line growth.
- Superior ROIC (8% TTM) and ROE (12% TTM) relative to other top holdings in the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU).
- EV/EBITDA: 6.37
- Debt to Capital: 73%
- Concerning negative FCF given high capex over the last 5 years.
- Directors, including  Richard Kelly, have been buying shares according to recent Form 4 filings.

“After extensive consideration and in light of the uncertainty associated with the causes and potential liabilities associated with these wildfires as well as state policy uncertainties, the PG&E boards determined that suspending the common and preferred stock dividends is prudent with respect to cash conservation and is in the best long-term interests of the companies, our customers and our shareholders,” said PG&E Corporation Chair of the Board Richard C.

t3_7s13yn,Basic Metrics Understanding Checkup,"Hi, can somebody confirm my understanding of these basic metrics? Just started learning about value investing a couple days ago.

**P/E Ratio = Market price per share / EPS**

- The lower the better typically, means it's potentially undervalued, look for companies under 15

**P/S = market cap / revenue & P/B = market cap / (total assets – total liabilities)**

- Low P/B and P/S indicates a potentially undervalued stock

**Debt to Equity ratio = (long term + short term debt) / total shareholders' equity**

- Look for a ratio below 1?

**Enterprise value = market cap + short term and long debt - cash & equivalents** 

**Free Cash Flow**

- Operating cash flow = Cash flow from operations from CFS
- Free cash flow = operating cash flow - capex
- put it over sales to see the % change over the past ten years

**Return on Invested Capital**

- NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - .4)
- Invested capital = total assets - liabilities excluding debt
- ROIC = NOPAT / Invested capital
- Should consistently be over 15% in the past couple years?

**Return on Tangible Capital**

- Adjusted working capital = Current Assets excl. cash - current liabilities excl. debt
- Net fixed assets = PP&E with depreciation accounted for
- Tangible Capital Employed = adjusted working capital + net fixed assets
- Return on Tangible capital = EBIT / tangible capital employed
- Must consistently be over 20% over the past couple years

t3_7slmdm,"Revisiting FOSL, plus 2 other retailers to buy now.","[I made a post 3 months ago supporting the case for FOSL.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/74rhhy/graham_and_fisher_are_telling_me_to_buy_fosl/)

Today FOSL is trading at 10.78.
At the time, October 7th, it was trading at about $9.00.

I entered my trade November 13, at $6.5952. I'm up 63%.
My basic case for FOSL is that it will not go bankrupt, and so you should keep buying while it is trading below book tangible value. The company is making operating profits and growing tangible book value despite a significant reduction in revenue due to changes in the fashion accessory landscape. Fossil is a dynamic company that has been public since 1993, and has never suffered an operating loss despite multiple recessions. 

The four reasons that the stock is trading below book value are (in no particular order):
1. Retail pessimism (cyclical retail decline compounded by fears of amazon)
2. Intangible write offs
3. New World Fossil initiative (improving operating margins)
4. Decline in revenues

I believe that none of these reasons justify a value below tangible book value.

Why is tangible book value the correct indicator to value FOSL? Because historically the tangible book value has been a solid indicator of a bottom for the company. Perhaps this is because a competitor can acquire the brand and inventory for a great price, so should the market. Tangible book has been rising since 2015. Ironically, when tangible book was dropping starting in 2011, the price didn't adjust accordingly. Price to tangible book has previously hit as high as 9 or 10, VERY high, and leaves no margin of safety.
I am not concerned about their debt position because they have a current ratio of over 2x during this recent down turn.
Current tangible book price is 11.37, today price to tangible book (PTB) is at 0.95. The two previous all time lows are, 1996 when PTB hit 1.56, and in 2009 it hit 1.10.

**I think FOSL is an overweight until it reaches $12.50 (1.10 PTB, 15% upside), even weight at $17.00 (1.56 PTB, 57% upside).**
Now, IF we see that FOSL is getting its groove back with an increase in annual revenues and profits, then this stock should be trading at least a 2x PTB ($22.74 at todays tangible book value), but this is a speculative position and I don't recommend this unless you have deep insight into the relevant retail trends, or you believe that FOSL is a brand that will survive and thrive over the next 5-10 years.
I personally have no idea what will happen to FOSL in the 5-10 year time frame, I will reduce my position at around $12.50, and consider exiting at around $15.00-17.00. I'm primarily looking for deterioration of tangible book value (or lack thereof). If FOSL does get its groove back, then this stock should be a good one to hold for decades.

At todays prices, my two other retail picks are:
FRAN - $6.17 - Current PTB is about 2x, I would be holding this until it reaches PTB of 3.25x ($10 price target, 62% upside.  Not trading below tangible book, but also has zero debt. Tangible book has been stable year after year. This is a profitable retailer in a niche market, net margins have declined to 5% inclusive of the impact of the hurricane which impacted its shops and distribution. 

BGFV - $6.15 - Tangible book per share of $9.27.  Despite all retail issues, tangible book per share has risen consistently every year, therefore I find it illogical that the stock should trade below tangible book value. Currently at 0.67 PTB, certain to return to the recent 0.85 PTB ($7.90), so overweight until $7.90, 28% return, I think the stock remains an overweight until it reaches previous multi-year PTB lows of 0.92 ($8.52). Overweight until 1x PTB, even weight until 1.25x PTB, and not very interested beyond 1.5x PTB. I find it hard to believe that BGFV will be a growth story in terms of revenues or margins, so I am not willing to hold it for more than a very modest PTB.

Other retailers that I have recently taken profits on are:
GNC - $3.31 entry, currently trading at $4.84. Company has a negative book value and has some major questions with its debt. If it passes its debt restructuring hurdle, then this company should return to a price north of $20, and if their China sales start to accelerate through 2018, then it can return to previous highs of $40-$60.
HIBB - $14.165 entry (0.90 PTB), currently trading at $25.50 (1.58 PTB). I've exited this position, but I think it is a buy until 2x PTB. (This is a very interesting stock because their current share buy back schedule implies a 100% return).

I hope this wasn't overly amateur, I am seeking cheap stocks that have a margin of safety. So far, so good.",5,0.78,1516781049,"[['FOSL', 7], ['VERY', 1], ['BGFV', 1], ['AMZN', 1]]",FOSL,9.65999984741211,8.800000190734863

t3_7y9xqc,Betting against Nvidia's monopoly on AI (NVDA),"Reposting a comment I made on another subreddit about Nvidia since I'm making a value argument against it.

=========================

Okay, no position in NVDA yet, but I plan on buying 2020 puts on it. They are way overvalued and too much future success has already been priced in. Why?

1.) Nvidia's pillar is AI in all its forms: data center training/inference, autonomous cars etc. Right now they are a monopoly charging monopoly prices. But their monopoly position will be aggressively challenged this year by Graphcore, AMD, Nervana (acquired by Intel), and Google's in-house TPU. Data center providers are still salty about Intel's monopoly on CPUs and will do all they can to avoid the same thing repeating with GPUs. We can already see that with Google's in-house level. I can only assume that AWS/MSFT are either doing something too or scoping out an AI chip startup to acquire (there are lots of those around). I doubt Nvidia will realize monopoly profits of the next two years that are already priced into the stock today.

2.) Look at Nvidia's revenue vs market cap. Now look at Intel's. Intel is actually a very similar company - most revenues come from selling to data centers (top top CPUs), to gamers (top CPUs) with some for personal computing (avg CPUs). Intel has had ZERO competition for years, only now is AMD a threat. For NVDA's revenue to market cap ratio to look like Intel's, its revenues would have to 5x (not an exact number, but you get the point). Highly unlikely to happen, especially due to new competition from point 1 above.

3.) Market will crash, most probably by 2020.

4.) Crypto will crash.

5.) Autonomous cars are decades away. Maybe California will have them within 10 years, MAYBE. The rest of America will take another 10 years with the rest of the world another 50 years after that.

I can elaborate more on the 1st point since I'm part of the deep learning community and that's kind of where I got that insight from, since my friends and I often talk about upcoming products from competitors since Nvidia GPUs are so damn expensive due to crypto.

As I said, I haven't taken a position yet since for the next few months I'll be liquidating my most of my current portfolio. At that time I will look to add Jan 2020 puts to my portfolio.... unless you convince me otherwise ;)

t3_7ytkf0,AviaAM Leasing Update,"A couple of months ago I posted a thesis here on a company called ""AviaAM Leasing AB"".  The full post is viewable [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/7j0aqz/long_thesis_aviaam_leasing_ab/).  

The prospects of these shares have changed considerably in the past week or so and definitely not for the better.  I'd just like to provide an update to the current situation, as I think the circumstances are somewhat unusual/interesting.

Last week, the company posted their full year 2017 financial statements, which were rather uneventful in and of themselves.  However, the real news from management was that a controlling group led by Zia Valda had increased their stake in the company to ~78%, and that they were initiating a squeeze-out process to eliminate all minority shareholders and take the company private.  Based on the regulations governing the Warsaw Stock Exchange, any majority holder owning over 90% of a security can compel the remaining 10% to surrender their shares for a set price, and any holder owning over 80% can delist the company from the exchange.  Zia Valda is essentially threatening minority shareholders with a delisting while using a tender offer to attempt to acquire their shares.  The real shot to the gut comes in the form of what Zia Valda is offering minority holders, as the 5.62/share price they have made in their offer is far less than the 6.36 print the stock closed at the day before, making this a complete take-under.  From everything I've read and from my correspondence with other investors, this price is surprisingly just about legal under Polish regulations, and Poland does not provide for the pursuit of appraisal rights.

Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this development.  My attitude towards these situations has always been ""hate the game, not the player"", but one can't help but feel angry at a manager who IPO'd a company at 8 PLN/share to raise capital in 2013, did such an abysmal job of IR that the company eroded to a fraction of its true intrinsic value, and then used their own incompetence as an opportunity to essentially steal the remaining shares they didn't already own at a price far less than they're really worth.  I can't imagine having owned this since the IPO in 2013 (or having bought it above 6 PLN the day before!)

For me, one failure in analysis I had was that I didn't realize that Mesotania Holdings was a Zia Valda affiliate (that paper trail went cold in Cyprus).  However, my main failure was my assumption that securities laws and regulations, despite their quirks, are largely similar across the western world.  Just in the last week, I've learned much about how minority shareholders are treated differently in Europe than in the United States, and I'll certainly be more aware of these nuances in the future.

As for AviaAM, one complication that may work in the favor of the minority holders is that the Company is based in Lithuania, not Poland.  From what I've been reading, Lithuania is far more minority owner-friendly than Poland is, especially regarding appraisal rights and minimum buyout offers.  I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out and how strong Zia Valda's hand may actually be.  My latest understanding is that they will be able to delist the company with 80% ownership, but won't be able to squeeze out at this offered price.  The tender offer doesn't close for a while, so I'm currently planning on waiting to see what announcements/lawsuits shake out from this.",10,0.86,1519104876,"[['IR', 1]]",IR,31.729999542236328,33.290000915527344
t3_7z1e2p,Anyone look at RAD?,"Read announcement today of buyout by Albertsons. Potential RAD arbitrage opportunity seemed intriguing on its face. Plus it seems like many burned by prior RAD/WBS merger may be scared away this time (pure speculation).

Two different ways of playing this:

1) play RAD merger spread
2) play ancillary players in this (i.e., Kimko)

I’ve only scratched surface on both these. For 2) I get the following:

Albertsons shares outstanding post-merger: 392,900,000

Implied Albertsons per share price: $23.16 ($1.83 cash divides by 0.079 shares)

Implied Albertsons value: $9,101,354,430
(as a check, this is within ballpark of announced $24B value, less the respective RAD and AB debt as of most recent 10-Q)

Kimko share of AB: 9.74%
Kimko value: $886,471,922
Kimko cost: $140,000,000
Kimko gain: $746,471,922

This looks like a substantial gain for Kimko. Presume it would have to pay tax on it (even though Kimko a REIT). Still that is something like $500M minimum gain.

Also, I didn't bother taking notes on stuff one could dig up online or some non-financial stuff that I frankly couldn't pay attention to (like high-level biographical info about when they were kids).

**Jamie Dinan, York Capital** - basically opened with a story of his life, which he said he thought of like an ""option"" where the two most relevant factors are volatility and time. Did IB, then merger arb, then went to law school. Seeded York with $5MM he raised from ex-DLJ colleagues. 

Back then smart college grads went to Goldman and McKinsey, whereas asset management was still a backwater so it was easier to get noticed and climb the ladder if you put your mind to it. Building a reputation as a hard worker that said yes to everything as an analyst is what built his reputation and allowed him to raise money for his fund.

*On markets* - bullish because global economy is doing extraordinarily well. Investor class (pension funds, SWFs) growing richer. There will be a correction but not like before. IG bond market is ""behind the economy"" and yields are going higher. Expect volatility and uncertainty in the market over the next few months.

York runs 0.3-0.5 beta portfolios.

Likes energy because it's inefficient, lots of technological change. Retail is challenging, brick and mortars are here to stay but valuations are richly-priced, and there is excess gross margin in the industry that will get competed away. Malls are overbuilt, but York is long real estate where demographics are growing. Very suspicious of administered care industry (hospitals, nursing homes, etc) because of high capex and reliance on government reimbursements. Orphan drugs are good. Excess supply in the telecom industry that will drive down revenue.

Likes credit because ""machines can't do it,"" you have to be active and there's too much friction and opacity for automation.

Buying the Milwaukee Bucks was the most fun investment, but since buying them three years ago they've only broken even. Giannis is the nicest kid you'll ever meet.

**Dave Miller, Elliott Management** - Volatility that we saw in 2018 is due to the market determining what will happen economically. Late in the cycle, high likelihood of downturn in next couple of years (could be preceded by some false starts like we saw in early Feb). Broker-dealer and bank balance sheets have shrunk since '08, which could help explain why credit has lagged equity this last decade.

**Angelo Rufino, Brookfield Asset Management** - the opportunity is global; international restructurings are more inefficient and thus more profitable. Rule of law is key in this process. Brought up their participation in the restructuring of Brazilian telecom Oi and how it's challenging in that equity has disproportionate influence in a bankruptcy.

**Jon Zinman, Solus Alternative Asset Management** - Also brought up Oi, also mention subordination issues in Brazil where debt isn't necessarily made whole before equity gets something. Regulator coming and taking over would have been the worst outcome. Bought the debt so cheap that any resolution to the bankruptcy would have been profitable. Currently there's an issue because the judge on the case gave the OI CEO a lot of sway, and that's being contested.

Apparently Solus was on the losing end of the Hovnanian CDS trade. Didn't mention the the firm by name (it's BX), but basically said it's not proper that an investor can extend credit conditional upon a voluntary technical default. Solus is challenging this in court.

Largely stayed away from retail but just got involved in Toys R Us. Brick and mortar is in danger as Amazon currently is prioritizing putting competitors out of business vs. making a profit. Brands are important, you can monetize the IP at Toys. Real estate is a complicated issue there because Toys stores are under a master lease.

**Matt Kimble, Avenue Capital** - Energy is a great industry for distresed debt investing as there's lots of cycles. Invest in upstream because that's where the BKs are. Avenue likes the power sector in particular, which is facing difficulty because of oversupply and low nat gas prices. Regulations are a big deal in power.

**Matthew Bonanno, York Capital** - focused on the BKs of Samson and Linn Energy. Linn business model was doomed to failure from the beginning, bought the distressed unsecured bonds at 9 cents, lots of dry powder for energy PE but the big buyers in Dallas are really only experienced in dealing with clean assets where they can just buy and start drilling.

Upstream has a G&A problem, need to reduce administrative overhang through consolidation.

**Marc Lasry, Avenue Capital** - (moderator asked him the same questions as for Dinan) bullish on market because economy doing well globally. Trump is getting all the credit for reforms put in motion by Obama. Real risk is exogenous events, with the example that you'd want 500bps over treasuries for South Korean sovereign debt for geopolitical risk and etc, but you'd only get 10.

Bullish on energy, seeing large restructurings in services and power sectors. Retail is tough, if investing has to be in senior debt. Long healthcare. No opinion on telecom, not enough companies in trouble.

Active investing has underperformed over the last few years because hedging is expensive.

Then Lasry spends half an hour talking about shenanigans he got into with Bill Clinton and Bush. Says Clinton is the smartest person he ever met.

**Bruce Richards, Marathon Asset Management** - never been as much duration related to interest rates as there is today. The three main drivers of rates (Fed, inflation, supply/demand) are all pointing to higher rates.

Low likelihood of global recessions, expect sub 25% downturn in earnings for a future recession. Recessions are hard to predict, and economists have been predicting them happening every year since 2015. One will probably happen in next couple years but nothing says it has to, Australia hasn't had one in 30 years. American economy accelerating because of deregulations, tax cuts, lots of capex, prediciting 3% GDP growth.

$54B in distressed bonds currently vs. $100B in dry powder for distressed assets. Managers who raised funds in the last few years anticipating a recession are running out of time to deploy capital. 

Institutional investors are shifting towards private credit, 2011-2013 fund vintages have had ~13% returns whereas last three year vintages have had ~8% returns.

Banks starting to lend to the upper middle market so there will be more competition for the direct lenders and BDCs. Smaller companies are still too cumbersome for banks - and borrowers don't have to put up with stricter covenants if they can turn to alternative lenders.

BBB debt issues are exploding, currently half the IG market.

PR is going to be a key issue going forward (referenced the heat on Klarman for buying COFINA bonds).

Both his fund and Avenue Capital are raising seperate aircraft leasing funds.

For the first time in a long time, Marathon is favoring southern Europe over northen Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal but staying away from Greece). Mostly corporate loans and CRE loans where they could take over the real estate.

The fraud resulted in a run on the bank that was stabilized when Berkshire Hathaway was asked to step in.  Berkshire provided a line of credit and received an equity stake.  Berkshire was going to get a second tranche of equity but over 80% of shareholders voted against it stating that the company had stabilized and that they did not see the value of issuing more stock to Berkshire.

Since the fraud, the company cleaned house and has a new executive team, has had two quarters of profits, and has the backing of Berkshire Hathaway.  There are some lawsuits pending but most of the fines and regulatory issues are over.  In addition, the lawsuits, while not insignificant, would not make a big dent on the bottom line.  They have also paid off the line of credit issued by Berkshire and had EPS for Q3 of $0.37 CAN and Q4 of $0.38 CAN.

t3_80stu4,$CATO - Value Opportunity or Value Trap?,"Value Investors/Security Analyzers,

tl;dr $CATO is an intriguing value play that looks absurdly cheap on the surface. Would love to hear your thoughts. 

Looking to gauge opinions on Cato Fashions ($CATO). Like many stocks that end up being value plays, this company is clearly ‘diseased’ and out of fashion, but there appears to be no chance that it is terminally ill given lots of cash, zero debt, and positive cash flow (for now at least). Here is pertinent balance sheet and stock info (data from most recent 10Q/10K or recent stock price):

-	Recent Price: $11.50
-	Shares Outstanding (Class A): ~24M
-	Market Capitalization ~ $276M
-	Unrestricted cash and investments - $215M (~$9/share)
-	Interest-bearing debt - $0
-	Enterprise Value ~$60M

So what does $60M get you?:
(To put Enterprise Value in context, if you pay $276K for a house, and then find $215K cash inside the house, how much did you pay for the house? Answer: $61K) In FYE 1/28/17, the company had around $72M in operating cash flow and returned $77M to shareholders via dividends and buybacks (though some goes to ~2M Class B shares). If the company were to repeat this performance in FYE Jan 2018, then you’d be fully paid back in one year. Through 9 months, the company has operating cash flow of $38M and returned $61M to shareholders. If they are otherwise inept, at least management is prioritizing returning money to shareholders over value-destroying growth. 

Ugliness:
To be clear, things are not pretty for this company. I believe the last 24 months have seen negative Y/Y same store sales growth (double digit declines for much of this period). The stock has been hammered as a result. The really good news is that all stores are leased, and lease terms are less than 5 years. A competent management should be able to identify stores with negative contribution margins that don’t support the overall strategy (more on this later) and allow these leases to lapse/close down the store. Sure this will mean more impairment, but again, this doesn’t require cash outflows. 

Strategy, from my perspective: 
Low cost fashion retailer concentrated in the Southeastern US, specializing in plus-sized women’s clothing. Stores are in strip malls (ideally anchored by a Walmart). Stores also offer credit and layaway for purchases. Minimal online presence. 

Strategy, analysis (much of this is my conjecture):
The Southeast is one of the poorest, and thus least healthy regions of the US (forgive the generalizations from someone from the Northeast). The combination of layaway and plus-sized clothing appears to be a pretty solid match for the region. Target customers are also likely underrepresented as Amazon Prime customers, so e-commerce threat is perhaps a bit limited. Historically, high density of stores and geographic concentration has been the winning strategy for retailers (think how Walmart grew from its Midwest base). I can’t say with any confidence that this is a long-term viable retailer (i.e. 10 year horizon), but if management can’t strategically close its non-performing 1,000+ stores, there should be scope for cash flow to improve. 

Other positives:
-	13 year board member Daniel Stowe (North Carolina business owner) bought 9,500 shares in 2017 at ~$14. Insider purchases by long-time, local board members (i.e. not someone who flies in 2x a year to meet) are generally best positive predictors. 

Risks:
-	For some odd reason, this company bought an airplane in FYE Jan 2017 (long trips between Mississippi and Alabama?). This is scary, because it could be indicative that founder/CEO John Cato is a crook. He only owns 5% of Class A stock, but in total has 43% of voting power (I’m sure his cronies get his voting power over 50%). The saving grace here is Class A stock gets dividends first, so Cato will need to pay us if he’s going to pay himself. 
-	It seems like there is some financial engineering going on (credit https://seekingalpha.com/article/4139384-cato-corporation-remains-dangerous-value-trap). Somehow, this North Carolina, US retailer has $24M of unrepatriated cash outside the US. There was also a positive adjustment to gift card estimates which helped net income this year. Not hugely concerned, given that cash can’t lie, however, and the company has a clean audit opinion from PwC. 
-	This company is a real mess, and could be a value trap with inept management. 24 months of declining same store sales is brutal. If things don’t turn around, the company could start bleeding cash. 
-	While the credit/layaway business seems complementary to the strategy (and really helps profits), it could pose some risks, especially given geographic concentration.

Overall:
I am willing to take a flyer on the company, given very limited downside. In my view, you are paying $11.50 for a $9 bill, which also generates cash every year. I think somewhere in the $15-17 range is fair for this stock, which gives a pretty decent margin of safety. Please disagree and/or offer alternative perspectives. Forgive the long post.

Edit: In the interests of full disclosure, I've recently entered into a long position in CATO. Additionally, I'm taking Bruce Greenwald's 'Value Investing' class this semester, and am hoping to crowdsource some ideas on this stock, since my group will likely be using it as our case for the final project.

t3_80s7d2,GME has a few puffs left,"GameStop is very cheap on an earnings multiple basis and also a dying business that nobody wants to invest in. 

With their most recent 8-K, GameStop reaffirmed their guidance for 2018 EPS hitting around the middle of $3.10-$3.40, *without factoring in the tax bill*. GME pays an effective tax rate of 32%, and lowering this to a conservative estimate of 20% we can estimate EPS of $3.67-$4.03 with a midpoint of $3.85. I can't predict earnings, but the positive tailwinds of the continued shortage for Nintendo Switch and the success of newer Xbox One models make me optimistic, especially considering that GME gave this exact guidance range last year and cruised comfortably over the top.

GME has an AT&T-store business which I'm not too excited about, and I'm a bit worried that their guidance of $80-$95M operating contribution, about $10-$25M lower than 2016, is optimistic solely based on the fact that they have missed their estimates badly in the past. It makes some amount of sense that GME wants to leverage their SG&A by growing their footprint; good luck to them(it also makes their numbers look better, but they go into enough detail that you can figure out exactly what the impact is).

When you look at the core business, things amazingly don't look so bad. The used disc business represents the largest segment of gross profit contribution to the business, about 30% of gross profit. In 2016, GME managed to sell about $2.2B worth of used games, earning a $1B gross profit. Over the past 10 years, the most they ever sold was $2.6B of used games(in 2012), earning a $1.2B gross profit. In other words, over the past 6 years, GME has lost about $200M in gross profit and seen this segment decline less than 3% per annum while gross margins slid .3%. Over that same time frame, total gross profit in the core business has slid by about $174M, even after margin contribution of $200M or so from an entirely new segment, ""collectibles."" 

It's important to think about where we are in the console cycle, with the Nintendo Switch shortage driving foot traffic into the stores, and likely with it, sales of collectibles, accessories, exclusive offers, and new discs. Reduced console sales pushing down sales of their higher-margin goods like collectibles and accessories may be the greatest threat on the downside.

Factors on the upside include Xbox expanding backwards-compatibility for old games, which potentially increases the value of GME's inventory and drives resurgence in their used game business. In addition, collectibles are a bright spot and growing quickly, although still a small contributor to bottom line.

If you just chart net income for GME by year over the past 10 years, there's no major deterioration in earning power that's apparent; it looks pretty flat(it's helped by debt-financed acquisitions). EPS, on the other hand, is not far from all-time highs for the business, with the difference due to buybacks. GME has their dividend and interest payments fully covered by cash flow, and I'm not too worried. 

In summary, you have a stock trading at 4x forward earnings and 5x forward EV/EBIT, where it seems that the market is pricing in an imminent collapse of the business that I do not believe will materialize. And fundamentally, I think AMZN is a threat to every retailer; but when you're trading at a 5x forward multiple you have less far to fall, and infinite upside.

The current stock price requires Netflix to triple BOTH revenue and net margin to eventually get at a PE level similar to current competitors in the industry (i.e. Disney and Time Warner). This assumes everyone maintains a net margin above 20% despite increasing competition.

Disney, Time Warner, Comcast, Amazon all generate more cash, generate more revenue. There must be a reason why Disney prefers to publish 10-20 movies annually instead of >80(?) for example. Netflix is earning less than 4 times interest, interest is more likely to go up than down in the future based on historic levels.

t3_82cpfs,Help calculating PLNT total net leverage ratio,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for a little understanding on how Planet Fitness is calculating their total net leverage ratio. In their most recent 10-K (page 58) they stated:

> As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our senior secured credit facility financial covenant with a leverage ratio of 3.4 to 1.0 which was calculated
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 based upon certain adjustments to EBITDA, as provided for under the terms of our senior secured credit facility.

Per the terms of their credit agreement (page 35), here is their definition of total net leverage ratio:

> “Total Net Leverage Ratio” means, on any date, the ratio of (a) the difference between (i) Total Indebtedness on such date less (ii) the amount of Unrestricted Cash and Unrestricted Cash Equivalents of the Loan Parties not at any time to exceed $30,000,000 on such date to (b) EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ended on or most recently prior to such date.

Just above that there's a definition for total indebtedness which is the sum of 5-6 things which are not immediately clear to me. For brevity in this post I'm not copying it here but the link to the agreement is at the bottom.

I'd like to see if someone here can come up with the same 3.4 to 1 leverage ratio that they have in their 10K, and show the calculation used to get there based on the numbers in their most recent statements.

- Some overlooked suppliers to QSRs growing overseas -- the likes of Lamb Weston (fries and other potato products) are benefitting from piggybacking QSR international expansion. In that industry, for instance, supply is highly constrained and they're expanding capacity at very high ROIICs. 

- Aftermarket car paint manufacturers like Axalta benefitting from consolidation among a fragmented customer base (called MSOs) resulting in more of their paint being used as opposed to suppliers with less exposure to those customers.

t3_84yqlk,NL Industries ($NL),"Would appreciate any thoughts on this. This seems so cheap it doesn't make sense. 


NL Industries (fka National Lead Company) is essentially a holding company of three stocks (KRO, CIX, and VHI) with a significant amount of environmental liabilities on its balance sheet. NL holds $1.14B  in cash and stock but is only valued at $407M.


The biggest drag on the stock is an adverse court decision in CA under which NL and two other companies (Sherwin Williams and ConAgra) were held joint and severally liable for creating a “public nuisance” from its legacy lead paint businesses. While the settlement amount is still TBD and will undoubtedly be material, I believe the current discount overastates NL’s exposure by a huge margin..


I value NL at **$770M, or $15.81/share, for an upside of 89%** from its current price. The math on this is pretty simple, though I admit my analysis on the potential legal exposure is speculative. Nonetheless, the current discount leaves plenty of room to be wrong. 


**KRO – 35.2M shares at $23.53 - $828M**

Really all the value of NL is via its 30% stake in Kronos Worldwide. KRO produces titanium oxide which used by paint manufacturers to make paint white. The business is extremely cyclical and the product is essentially a commodity. While the business is on the up cycle, I believe the company is conservatively valued at 8.4x EBIT versus its peer average of ~18x (CC, TROX, VNTR).  


**CIX – 10.8M shares at $13.25 - $145M**

NL owns over 80% of CompX International which manufactures mechanical locks and boat parts. It’s admittedly a shit but stable business andI think the current valuation (P/E 13x, EV/EBITDA 7.2x) adequately captures this. 


**VHI – 14.4M shares at $6.91 - $100M**

VHI is the parent company of NL, KRO, and CIX (actually more like a “sub”-parent as VHI is owned by privately-owned Contran Corporation) . Why NL holds shares in its parent co. is beyond me.

I have yet to do any DD on VHI but it’s pretty immaterial relative its other holdings. If you want to be conservative go ahead and slash the value in half and call it $50M.


**Cash - $69M**

Now on to the liabilities….


**Total Liabilities – ($184M)**

NL really has no debt but is on the hook for environmental remediation costs and a nominal amount of accrued pension costs. For the sake of being conservative I’m subtracting total liabilities in their whole.

If you feel like fine-tuning this number note that while the balance sheet reports $107M in EROs, there's a footnote in the latest 10-K that notes this figure could increase to $154M.  If you do a DCF analysis on the $154M I expect you’ll get a similar amount. 


**Lead Abatement Settlement – Base Case:  ($188M),  Worst Case: ($283M), Best Case: ($0M)**

The original decision came in December 2013, where the judge ruled NL, SHW, and CAG (defendants) were joint and severally liable for $1.15M to fund an abatement program to remediate lead exposure in CA homes built pre-1980.

The defendants unsuccessfully appealed but the court did narrow the scope of homes to those built prior to 1950, which will significantly reduce the total settlement amount. The amount is pending re-review but NL’s attorney was quoted saying the will come in at ~$400M, while plaintiff’s attorneys say $700M. Call it confirmation bias, but I believe the math sides with the defense counsel. Here’s why:

The original ruling covered homes built prior to 1980, approximately 4.70M homes. When the appeals court narrowed the scope to pre-1950 homes, it reduced this to 1.55M homes, or 33% of the original amount. 33% of $1.15M is ~$378M.

While I peg the settlement amount at $378M, the ruling only covered 9 counties and other CA jurisdictions will undoubtedly pursue similar relief with ease. Fortunately these 9 counties covered 67% of the CA population per census data. As such I am using $565M as my total settlement projection ($387M divided by 0.67). 

Also worth noting: the average square footage of new homes increased significantly between 1950-1980, from under 1000 sqft. to 1600 sqft. which could further bring this number down. 

Here’s where it gets tricky: CAG, SHW, and NL will undoubtedly sue the hell out of each other to minimize their respective contributions. The three defendants are held joint and severally liable, meaning they are each liable for the full settlement amount. The plaintiffs can colllect this from any of the defendants, and I expect they will go after the most liquid company to get the full amount. This definitely won't be NL. It will then be up to the defendants to fight over who pays what.

For my base case I’m assuming each party equally splits the $565 amount, or $188M each. For my worst case I’m assuming NL pays half, or $283M which I believe is extremely unlikely – in reviewing the facts discussed in the court’s decision they each appear to be equally culpable.

Also, NL, CAG, and SHW will have the opportunity to drag other tortfeasors into this. 


 I see four ways NL gets out of paying all together:

1 – SCOTUS overturns the CA ruling. While something like 1% of cases get accepted for SCOTUS review, this one has a higher likelihood IMO given the policy implications. NL is basically being retroactively charged with creating a public nuisance through its promotion of a legal product. This sets a dangerous precedent – think gun manufactures, oil and gas, alcohol and tobacco, opiates, etc. Either way, probably shouldn't count on this outcome. 

2 – CA Voters pass the Health Homes and Schools Act in November 2018. The defendants are cleverly funding a ballot initiative to create a $2B fund for lead paint remediation which would nullify the court’s ruling all together. Take a guess on how I’ll be voting.

3 – Sherwin Williams pays NL’s share. I have no real basis for this, but NL sold its leading paint brand to SHW in 1980. I could see NL arguing that SHW is the successor in this liability. 

4 – NL’s GL insurance covers its contribution. NL has insurance but frustratingly doesn’t disclose how much. Either way, NL will fight tooth and nail to have its insurers pay all/some of this. However, I have no doubt the insurance companies will argue NL’s mandatory contribution to the abatement fund doesn’t qualify as covered “damages”, and the argument will be decided in court.


Final Value - $770M or $15.81/share


Biggest risks

1 – downturn in TiO2 cycle leading to KRO price decrease
2 – attorney’s in other states will try to replicate the same legal approach. I’m less concerned on this as California is uniquely retarded, and similar suits have failed in other states. Still, this is the biggest bear thesis.
3 – NL’s contribution to the abatement fund is larger than expected


I should note that NL does have recurring corporate costs (~11-12M a year which should wind down as legal issues get resolved). I should DCF this and subtract from my valuation, but fine without as I think I'm already conservative on valuing the liabilities.

t3_86bb8k,My cocktail napkin for Photronics Inc (PLAB US),"Hey Guys,

My brief and short valuation of Photronics. PLAB is a semiconductor photomask manufacture trading in the mid cap range. Numbers in the following is partly from 10-K and partly from 10-Q.

Net assets calculation:
Current assets @ 50 % discount: 492,357 * 50 % = 246,178.5
Total liabilities @ 100 %: 163,009
 
Net assets = 83,169.5

Human capital calculation:
SG&A @ 1x: 43,585

Human capital = 43.585

Property, Equipment and Land calculation:
PP&E @ 50 %: 1,862,163 * 50 %

Property, Equipment and Land = 931,081.5

Commitments calculation:
Operating leases: 3,925

Net Aseet Value: 83,169,5 + 43,585 + 931,081.5 - 3,925 = 1,053,911 USD

All numbers are in 1.000 so that’s roughly a NAV of 1 Billion. This number is about the same as its earnings price value ([operating income + depreciations - taxes]/discount rate + cash). I used 10 %. 

The NAV equals a share price of ~15,2 USD and at a margin of safety on 2/3 it’s a buy at anything less then ~10,1 USD. It currently trades at 9,05 USD. 

Any takes on this one? I own a small allocation while I’m getting comfortable that I bought at a little less then 8 USD. Do your own research, don’t consider this a buy recommendation.

t3_89l1d6,Questions regarding Buffett's 2010 Geico Valuation,"I apologize in advance for the elementary questions.

In the 2010 Berkshire annual letter, Buffett explained his 1996 estimate of Geico's intrinsic value to be $4.6 Billion:

$1.9 B Tangible Equity + $2.7 B Economic Value of Policyholders = $4.6 B valuation

Annual premium volume at the time was $2.8 billion, so Buffett was valuing customers at 97% of what they paid annually. 

My question is why is this 97% figure appropriate to determine policyholder's value?

 I assume that this hinges on estimates of how long policyholders remain with the Geico, future policy pricing and operational expenses? If this is the case, why does Buffett present policyholder's value as a percentage of annual premiums instead of a standalone figure?

Also, this valuation seems to disregard Geico's potential in 1996 to gain market share. What am I missing?

From the letter:
""Let me quantify Tony’s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn’t already
own, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangible
net worth of $1.9 billion.
The excess over tangible net worth of the implied value – $2.7 billion – was what we estimated
GEICO’s “goodwill” to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholders
who were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in
premiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO’s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were
annually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary
insurer: Because of the company’s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.
Today, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our
books at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICO
increases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic value
decreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick we
applied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO’s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And this
value is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO – off to a strong start in 2011 – is the
gift that keeps giving.""",14,0.78,1522805856,"[['B', 3]]",B,58.7599983215332,60.79999923706055

Dalio has been trying to build business in China for years. China is notoriously difficult to navigate and if the government doesn’t like you, you will face a wall of bureaucracy as a hedge fund manager. 

If Dalio put shorts on something like MSCI China ETFs, the Chinese government would refuse to allow him to operate in China and would try and attack him through the part newspaper like they have Soros and Kyle Bass, both yuan bears

Trade between eu and china has grown over last twenty years. China is now the eu’s biggest trading partner. 

If China is slowing down, this could explain the EU recent slowdown.

Not my own theory, got part of it from zero hedge. But there is logic to it when you feel it out.

So I am just looking for some advice on what to specifically look for in analyzing a HY name.

As I am starting out with some analysis, I realized that certain things like long-term growth initiatives might mean different things for equity vs debt holders (cash outlay). Also, what is kind of throwing me off is the capped upside on a HY bond (10-15%), and I guess just how to go about to justify/evaluate that in a thesis. The only credit pitch that I have ever worked on (with someone else) was one already in default (trading at 10c on the dollar), so any advice in general would be tremendously helpful.

I'm coming to you today because I've been learning a lot of value investing recently, but it's hard to know if I'm on the right track. 


So what I do is I compare myself to other analysts of the same company, see how far am I. Their number is of course not an absolute truth, but I guess it's closer to it than one calculated by a beginner.


So, let's take Michelin, which is a French big cap.

http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xpar/ml/quote.html


Why did I pick this ? Well, furthmore than being French myself, this is a pure stable/non-growth company. So... I guess it's supposed to be easier to estimate.


* The company has almost no debt and no financial health issue (0,2 debt/equity, current ratio 1,83, Baa1 Moodys)
* Its rentablity is very good (ROE/ROIC >10% for many years)
* BV per share is at 58,03€ and with a growth average of 8,8%/year (10 years)
* Dividends were 3,25€ in 2017 and with a growth average of 13,8%/year (10 years)


So I have everything I want to compute a intrisic value calculation. This gives me an average of around 100-110€ for a return of 6-9% per year during 10 years, which seem fair to me regarding averages return of placements today + risk.


Current share value is at 116€ so for me, it's a bit overpriced. As I begin I tend to put a big margin of safety even afterwards, so here if I compute 100€ I wouldn't buy above 80€.


However, when I look at analysts who publish in the press, I see they analyze the fair value around 140€. Some even state 150€ or 170€ !!!  With my model, 170€ is equivalent to a annual return of 1% ! How can I be so far off ? Is there a big parameter I am missing here ?

t3_8mxgcx,Altice USA - long thesis with catalysts,"Some of my initial thoughts on Altice USA – which is potentially a 'special situation' in the cable sector. The company is currently undergoing some structural changes as they are being spun off from their struggling European parent, Altice \(referred below as Altice EU\) went through a reckless buying spree over the last few years.

I thought it could be interesting, as Altice USA is further along in the capex journey in terms of upgrading to digital, than Charter \(being that they have a smaller footprint to upgrade\) and they have suffered from being an arbitrage target over the last few months \(IPO lockup period ended in Dec 2017, and a 27&#37; short on the float due to spin dynamics\).

**Altice USA:**

* **Current price**: $18.50; **Market Cap**: $13.6bn, **Net Debt**: $22bn \(5.4x\)
* **Fourth largest cable provider in the US** – with 4.5m customers and passes through 8.6m homes
   * 45&#37; of the $9.3bn in revenue is made up of TV and 55&#37; broadband
      * Broadband is accelerating growth with 4Q17 rev up 13.1&#37; driven by ARPU growing 10.6&#37; y/y.
      * Similar to Charter, I expect **EBITDA margins for broadband are approximately \+60\%** versus 40&#37; for the whole business \(company does not break this out\)  due to high programming costs/carriage fees \(approx 70&#37; of tv revenue\)
* Strong fundamentals with attractive valuation **\(8.0x 2018E EBITDA** versus Charter at 9.4x\)
* Background: In 2015 Altice EU, a European telecom company, purchased US cable systems Suddenlink and Cablevision – \(will do MR on what they paid for these businesses\)
   * Altice EU IPO’d 10&#37; of the Altice USA shares on the NYSE for $30 in June 2017, the shares currently trade around $18.50
   * **Altice EU has decided to spinoff Altice USA on June 8th**  which will increase the float by 4x
* Altice EU shareholders will receive 0.4163 of a US share for each share in the spinoff. As a part of the spin, **Altice USA has committed to a $2bn repurchase** over the next 3 years \(15&#37; of the MC\)
* Altice EU went on a massive M&A spree over the last few years, and now find themselves highly geared \(6.5x\) and with little to show for it – hence why they are slowly divesting assets
* Due to the decision to spin, arbitragers have been heavily shorting Altice USA \(currently short sales account for 27&#37; of the float\)
* Further to the arbitrage dynamic, the lockup period for the IPO has also served as an overhang which expired in Dec 2017. The number locked up was more than 233m and only 51.7m were trading at the time
* **Tax loss carry\-forwards** will shield Altice USA’s rising cash flow and the US business has committed to buying back stock with that cash
* R**ecently added to the Goldman Sachs ‘High Conviction’ list**  **with a target price of $28 \(50\% upside\)** based on the expected rise in FCF/share from $2.20 to $3.09 per share \(or 18&#37; CAGR\) in 2020 while keeping debt levels to 4.5x and continuous buybacks
   * Consensus Mean Target Price: $26.50 \(43&#37; upside\); DB: $38 ; Citi: $30 ;
* Risks: **The debt is quite high at around 5.4x net debt/EBITDA,** the upside is that Altice has lower capex spend, having already invested in digital set\-top boxes – and therefore Net Debt/\(EBITDA\-capex\) is **7.7x versus 10.7x for Charter \(due to higher capex phase\)**
   * As at 2017 year\-end  86&#37; of homes within Altice USA’s footprint have access to 400 Mbps or greater, up 23&#37; a year ago, compare this broadband speed to Charter’s where only 25&#37; of the footprint have access to 200 Mbps – hence the lower capex going forward
   * Although Altice USA is highly levered, borrowing costs may decrease as the co. refinances/class 1/3rd of it’s highest\-cost notes in 2018/2019.
   * **It is also worth noting that 85\% of the debt is fixed rate**
* Cable companies typically operate 'local monopolies', plus Altice has negligible overlap with Charter and Comcast. This means that post\-spin \(increased float\) will make Altice a prime M&A target \(esp if Trump softens regulation on the sector\):

I’m eagerly scanning all the 8-K (and other filings) my spare time can muster in the pursuit if learning how to uncover special situations that might be good value investments.

Today I stumbled upon Schulman A’s latest 8-K (yup a couple days behind), and saw that LyondellBasell Industries plans to merge with Schulman A.

The offer: 42 $ per shares (currently around 44.35 $) and contingent value right currently judged to be worth 2.35 $ given that “the market is correct”. The rights gives the holders 85 % of the proceeds regarding some litigation less customer claims and expenses of the first 38.5 m$ and splits the proceeds 85/15 between CVR right holders and LyondellBasell of amount above that. 

My question is not whether this is a good value trade, but rather if anybody have examples of previous mergers with CVR’s gave good returns and bad returns so I can study them a bit?

And does anybody have good experience with value investing in this area? If the merger goes through and it’s possible to buy the share (have not been so yet) for less then 42 $ it seems like a nobrainer. Of course mergers does not always go according to plan.

t3_8s81fp,'Back of the envelope' Calculations,"Hi all,

I hear this thrown around a fair bit: ""it should only require a back of the envelope calculation"". As a novice value investor, this seems very enticing to me... synthesizing the immense amount of inputs that go into any valuation into a few key value drivers, and using these to arrive at a price, without labouring through the process of creating a functioning model. And its not that i disregard the importance of DCF models, but I often find the assumptions (especially as the forecast-horizon increases) egregious. With so much value stored in the terminal value, and with how sensitive it is to your inputs, it intrigues me that successful market participants can translate current operating characteristics into a clear idea of underlying value. Can anyone provide any insight into this? Can you give me examples of investments you may have made where value was so clear, and what the characteristics of the operations/financials were that made it so? 

This question essentially stems from my recent examination of an Australian growth firm which looks extremely attractive to me in terms of its underlying economics and attractive capital structure (essentially allowing for an annualised ROCE of 35-40%). But, as i laboured through the DCF, making assumptions about future capital raising, growth rates etc., it felt dismal trying to make any meaningful attempts at forecasting revenue/operating margins etc. 5+ years out.

My intuition is that these back of the envelope calculations may revolve around cash flow yields, i.e. a 20% FCFE yield is clearly attractive. But i'd love to hear from all you knowledgeable people and your thoughts.

t3_8sgirg,technicolor,"Technicolor is value filth of the highest order. Below is a quick and dirty look at it.

Interested in hearing any feedback from people with good knowledge of connected home and production businesses.

Technicolor (TCH) is a deeply unloved amalgamation of 4 entertainment businesses, 2 which matter and 2 which provide free options in the future, but all 4 have caused the problems in the stock. 

Set top box and router business – Almost doubled the size of this business in 2015 by buying Cisco’s business in cash and stock for $580m. Paying 0.3x sales and 6x EBITDA, this acquisition was meant to take them to scale and improve margins. However due to rising DRAM and NAND prices margins fell to 5.7% last year instead of the 10%+ they would have been without the higher chip prices.  At 10% margins and 6x EBITDA this business is worth €3.40 per share. 

Production – They produce and animate movies, adverts and games. They are one of the top 2 players in the visual effects (VFX) industry alongside Disney. The movies they worked on have won 4 Oscars and 3 BAFTA’s in the past year. Revenues were flat in this business last year after a big 2016 in the ad business. On a similar multiple to an ad agency at 8x EBITDA it is worth €2.20 a share.  

DVD – Historically they owned IP related to DVD production and printing but have since outsourced the majority of this to Sony. Nonetheless having anything related to DVD’s creates negative sentiment. With over a billion of revenues and 10% EBITDA margins the business has some value but we value it at €0.  

Licensing business – Involves licencing and enforcing its 40k patents in areas ranging from video coding to display technology. They sold this business for $150m earlier this year to IDCC. This was the final straw for most investors as they had valued it at considerably higher price. However TCH will get 42.5% of any future revenues from this without the management distraction of fighting lawsuits etc. IDCC have a very good track record monetising patents and if they were to achieve their average ROIC then it would translate to $28m (8c a share) a year of cash flow to TCH. We value the business at €0.  

Why is our view different?

We believe the stock is washed out and that most investors have given up on it after an 80% collapse since the beginning of 2016. The capitulation is clear as over 100% of the shares have traded since February this year. The change in the shareholder register is also interesting and appears to have gone unnoticed. Cisco have been a price insensitive seller as they dump the shares they got as part of the transaction, whilst the CEO and Chairman have recently bought shares. There has also been increased murmurings from quasi activists, RWC, JO Hambro and Lansdowne between them they own at least 15% of the shares. Unlike the rest of the market we do not believe memory prices will increase forever and with new supply coming on in the second half of ’18 pricing should normalise, meaning margins at TCH mean revert.

t3_8sduow,Aurora Cannabis and Medreleaf Risk Arb,"This is pretty short since there isn't much too it.

Aurora (""ACB"") is acquiring Medreleaf (""LEAF"") for 3.575 shares per share of LEAF. This currently equates to 22.6&#37; premium to LEAF's current trading price. 

First, ACB has a ridiculous borrow cost, so I'd suggest using a synthetic short on it as opposed to shorting it. I've structured my position to have a bit of upside to ACB's price, but there's no reason to if you want it to be strictly risk arb. 

The deal is expected to close August (with the special shareholder vote on July 18), so there isn't really any time risk. The annualized return is nearly unbeatable assuming it closes on this timeline.

The deal is going to go through because:

\- No real legislative hurdles. This makes Aurora the largest LP in Canada, but there are a substantial number of players still in the market.

\- LEAF requires 66.66&#37; of shareholders to vote in favor of the transaction. 56&#37; of the shareholders are already locked into voting in favor.

\- ACB requires a simple majority. This is likely the only real maybe as to a sticking point. ACB is widely held with no significant institutional investors. Institutions hold 4.4&#37; of shares, insiders hold 6.5&#37; of shares. I still don't see a world in which ACB votes this down. It's fully supported by both LEAF and ACB's boards. There are some concerns around ACB diluting further, but in the current market it's nothing but expected.

\- Hefty breakup fee of $80mn up to $95mn.

t3_8svgmf,Calculating Owner Earnings?," The book i'm reading says you should start out with is Net Income from the cash flow statement. Unfortunately different sites use slightly different values for Net Income on the 1st line of the cash flow statement. The example i'm looking at is KMB (2017 annual). 

Yahoo Finance is showing 2,278 which is ""Net Income""

Other financial sites i've looked at is showing 2,319 which is ""Net Income Attributed to KMB""

2,319 - 41 (Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest) = 2,278

t3_8toue2,Special situation - Chapter 11 with liquidation incentived management,"Hey All,

Still on my quest to learning about different special investments. This weekend I stumbled upon Orexigen Therapeutics 8-K from the 22th of June. I have not heard about this company before, but they got me excited when I saw that the management was incentived to actually sell the assets of the company.

Basically Orexigen filed for ch. 11 on the 12th of march and got a bid the 23th of aprilk for its assets from Nalpropion Pharmaceutiicals of 75mUSD. 4 days before Bankruptcy Court approved a Key Employee Incentive Plan (KEIP), which basically means that management will score 350.000 USD if this sales go through. Bankruptcy Court wanted a ""Stalking horse"" bidder, and on the 22th of June, the company said they did not receive any other bids. A little side note, two days after the KEIP was approved, a little investor called Baupost was mentioned in a SC 13D report owning 37,5 &#37; of the company (Up significantly according to my Bloomberg right now). Not a lot of shares are changing hands (from an institutional perspective) which might keep some away because its difficult to build a significant position.  


My question is, if the company gets sold, what about the DIP financing they got, dont they have a claim on the proceeds before equity holder? (Seems like its ""only"" 35m). And what about all of the other debt, can that just go with the assets in a sale like this? And lastly, is this a common situation during chapter 11 cases where a reorganisation is not possible and do you have examples going good and going bad?

t3_8y3uwo,Understanding Amazon,"Hey everyone, I just started looking at Amazon and I have a few questions.

Firstly, the investment thesis that I hear thrown around a lot is that Amazon has a weak bottom-line due to their continued re-investments, which is why their earnings are so low. On their balance sheets most of the revenue goes toward cost of sales, however, and it seems depreciation is another monster that ate up 12.2 billion from earnings this quarter alone. Hence, where in the world is this supposed ""re-investments"" as the reason for Amazon's meager earnings?

Secondly, I am struggling to understand if Amazon does have so little earnings, where in the world does it cough up its cash position that's currently sitting at 16.7 billion? So far, it seems to be almost entirely adding back depreciation. And if lease expenses are counted, the free cash flow of Amazon is significantly lower, and right now ""free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases decreased to an outflow of $3.0 billion for the trailing twelve months""so how is Amazon the FCF machine that people tout?

WH (Wyndham Hotels & Resorts): shit hotels, 52&#37; daily occupancy rate for its rooms, a third of the revenue per available room as Hilton and Intercontinental…yet now at almost a trailing PE of 20 it’s trading close to Hilton and Intercontinental, which trump WH in both occupancy (75&#37; daily occupancy rate on average for their different segments) and RevPAR. Moreover, as a mid-scale and economy hotel provider, it faces far much uncertainty in its occupancy and ability to attract customers in economic cycles. With the American economy more robust than ever in the past few years, its occupancy rate has actually be dropping (from 54.5&#37; in 2015 to 52.0&#37; in 2017). How could this business even justify having a PE ratio that approaches strong, high-end, high occupancy hotels like Hilton and Intercontinental? 

WYND (Wyndham Destinations): solid business, stable cash flow, long-term predictability. Not a fantastic business, but currently trades at close to 7 PE ratio. Marriott’s timeshare/vacation rental business is at 14, Hilton’s is at 22. 

Most importantly, WYND brings in triple the revenue of WH ($907M vs $302M), while WYND’s adjusted earnings is at $85M and WH at $58M from Q1 2018 (adjusted WH’s $64M in earnings by subtracting a $6M one-time hurricane insurance recovery revenue). And yet, WYND has the smaller market cap at $4.5B vs WH’s $5.84B. 

I haven’t been able to find that much information on either companies yet, just because the spinoff happened relatively recently and they haven’t filed independent financial statements and MD&As afterward.

t3_8yfxnv,[Long thesis] Pershing Square Holdings (Bill Ackman's hedge fund) - Thoughts?,"Ackman’s stellar long-term record has been overshadowed by 3 years of underperformance and PSH shares now seems to offer significant value. Curious to get everyone's thoughts on this.  
**Summary**

* Pershing Square Holdings (PSH) is a hedge fund run by legendary value/activist investor Bill Ackman.
* Over the last 3 years, PSH’s concentrated fund has drastically underperformed the market by 70.1&#37;.
* As a result, PSH is currently trading at a [\~23&#37; discount to Net Asset Value (NAV).](https://www.pershingsquareholdings.com/company-reports/weekly-navs/)
* However, despite recent results, I argue that: (1) PSH’s long-term track record and performance is excellent, outperforming the market by over 272.8&#37; over the last 13 years. (2) PSH is extremely undervalued compared to its peers. (3) Significant catalysts exist that are expected to narrow the discount to NAV.

**Performance worries**

The major reason for the large discount to NAV is the underperformance over the last few years. Indeed, PSH has returned an abysmal -20.5&#37; in 2015, -13.5&#37; in 2016 and -2.1&#37; in 2017, compared to +1.4&#37;, +11.9&#37; and +21&#37; respectively by the S&P 500 for a total underperformance of 70.1&#37;.

While the past few years have undoubtedly been disappointing, even accounting for these terrible years Ackman and PSH’s track record since inception is still stellar. Indeed, in the 13 years since 2004, PSH has generated 493.6&#37; compared to 220.8&#37; by the S&P 500, beating it by 272.8&#37;. Put another way, from 2004–2017, PSH has generated compounded annual returns of 13.6&#37; compared to 8.7&#37; by the S&P 500. This is an incredible long-term performance and 2018 results (8.8&#37; vs 0.97&#37; S&P) suggest mean reversion is underway and his 3 year losing streak may be over.  


https://preview.redd.it/zwt9n066fj911.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ef39205b007f82e83f3ca9b6ebf2314ed3b2ee

The gross results (i.e. actual investment results without accounting for hedge fund fees) are even more impressive, showing Ackman beating both the S&P 500 and Berkshire Hathaway by over 770&#37;, with gross compounded annual returns of 18.2&#37;.  


[Source: Slide 9 of this presentation \(https:\/\/assets.pershingsquareholdings.com\/media\/2017\/01\/26165616\/2016-PSH-Annual-Update-Presentation-FOR-DISTRIBUTION-1.pdf\)](https://preview.redd.it/9qiuyt3bfj911.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=63eda1eb095399046d85cfdd64c95374684b0c59)

It’s worth noting that PSH runs a notoriously concentrated portfolio with generally less than 10 positions and thus suffers from much higher volatility than most funds. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as many of the great value investors believe in concentration as it allows you to get to know a few companies very well. Greenblatt’s Gotham Capital achieved 40&#37; annualized returns from 1995–2006 while having 6–8 positions make up 80&#37; of the portfolio.

The downside of this is that afew big losers/winners can heavily skew the results. While in the past this benefitted Ackman with big winners such as General Growth Properties ([GGP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GGP)), Wendy’s ([WEN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WEN)) and Canadian Pacific ([CP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CP)), he’s made his fair share of mistakes over the last few years, the biggest of which being Valeant (VLX) on which [he reportedly lost $4.6B](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-14/bill-ackman-is-done-losing-money-on-valeant) and the Herbalife (HLF) short on which he lost $1B. Together, these two companies account for over 80&#37; of the underperformance over the last three years.

[He’s stated he has learned from these mistakes and will be going “back to basics” as an activist investor and avoiding the limelight going forward (i.e. no more public shorts and CNBC live-broadcast arguments with Carl Icahn)](https://www.reteurs.com/article/us-hedgefunds-ackman-exclusive/exclusive-ackman-cuts-staff-shuns-limelight-as-he-seeks-to-turn-around-fund-idUSKBN1FB32Y). His current portfolio seems to demonstrate this, consisting largely of solid, cashflow-generating businesses. While the quality of his current portfolio doesn’t pertain to this investment thesis, it is worth noting that PSH is extremely transparent regarding their investments and the research behind them, with much of their analysis being [found in annual letters here](https://www.pershingsquareholdings.com/company-reports/financial-statements/) or individual company reports. PSH’s portfolio is up 8.8&#37; this year versus 0.97&#37; by the S&P500.

**Comparables**

[In the US, the average closed-end fund trades at a 4.5&#37; discount to NAV.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4065639-closed-end-fund-discounts-continue-fall-cef-weekly-update) In fact, there is only one fund in the US trading at a similar discount to PSH and that’s Foxby (FXBY), a fund with a track record that doesn’t even come close to PSH’s with only about $5M AUM and [\-5.12&#37; annual returns since inception](https://www.cefconect.com/fund/FXBY).  


https://preview.redd.it/bm9xr2pkfj911.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c699ad436e1d782fd6dce895d46149b21bdc5e0

Indeed, the most similar firms can be seen as Carl Icahn’s investment fund IEP and Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, both of which have similar long-term track records to Ackman. Indeed, IEP has yielded an annualized rate of return of approximately 7.5&#37; since 2004 ([source: page 15 of this presentation](https://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/IEP_nov_2016_-_Investor_Presentation_FINAL.pdf)) and Berkshire Hathaway 9&#37; return since 2004. In the same time period, PSH provided annualized returns of 13.7&#37; and yet it trades at a 23&#37; discount to NAV while IEP and BRK trade at 30&#37; and 40&#37; premiums to their respective NAV's.

**Catalysts**

1. Stock buyback — $300M stock buyback offer has been completed at a strike price of $13.47/share, reflecting a 20.5&#37; discount to NAV. While this had very little effect on the discount to NAV, it decreased free float and is likely to have a positive effect if demand for PSH shares go up following other catalysts. Also, it further increased insider ownership and commitment to improving PSH’s performance.
2. Insider ownership limit removed — PSH shareholders have voted to remove the 4.99&#37; insider ownership limit, thus allowing insiders to purchase more PSH stock and further narrowing the discount to NAV. [In the first 2 weeks of May alone, Ackman purchased 10,804,142 public shares at an average price of $14.79/share ($160M total) while Mr Botta (CFO of PSH) purchased 18,648 shares at an average price of $14 ($261,072 total)](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/media/2018/06/07105025/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-Announces-Purchases-of-PSH-Public-Shares-by-Bill-Ackman-and-Nick-Botta-and-the-Listing-of-Additional-Public-Shares-Due-to-Conversion-of-Management-Shares.pdf).
3. Personal investments by Ackman — Ackman himself has stated in the latest shareholder letter that he plans to invest significant personal funds (“several hundred million dollars”) into purchasing PSH stock over the next year. There are reports [he is selling luxury apartments from his successful real-estate venture in Philadelphia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/ackman-to-plow-luxury-apartment-gains-into-hedge-fund-buyback) in order to reinvest the money into repurchasing PSH stock.
4. No fees — While closed-end funds normally trade at a small discount to NAV due to fees charged (US closed-end funds trade at an average of \~4.5&#37; discount to NAV), PSH’s management agreement has a “high water mark” features such that investors only pay performance fees on increases in NAV above the highest NAV at a which a performance fee has recently been charged. As a result, investors will not be charged any performance fees until the NAV reaches the “high water mark” value of $26.37 per share. For reference, NAV is currently $18.75 and thus the next \~40&#37; of NAV appreciation will be fee-free.
5. Possibility of liquidation- As a result of the above “high water mark” feature, [some analysts have speculated that PSH management may eventually be incentivised to liquidate the fund in order to start a new one where they could immediately earn performance fees.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4127867-pershing-square-holdings-hedge-fund-available-23-percent-discount) If this is the case, investors would realise an immediate gain equivalent to the discount to NAV (currently 23.5&#37;). It is worth noting that, unlike many hedge funds, PSH’s portfolio doesn’t include any venture investments or other illiquid investments and in fact consists only of highly liquid securities.
6. Improved performance — Performance is improving as PSH is up 19&#37; this quarter and 8.8&#37; this year, compared to the S&P500 which is up 0.37&#37;.
7. Lawsuits settled — Alergan/Valeant insider trading lawsuits have now been settled, eliminating one of the major sources of uncertainty regarding PSH stock price and allowing Ackman to focus solely on delivering alpha.
8. Size of fund — Ackman currently manages around $8B in assets (down from nearly $20B at his peak), making the set of available investment opportunities much larger and potential returns far greater. As Buffett says, “size is the enemy of performance” in investment.
9. Personal factors — Ackman is clearly fiercely competitive and is unsatisfied with recent results. Many factors seem to point to the fact that Ackman is now back focussed and devoting himself fully to PSH. He has divested other investments in order to pour significant personal funds into PSH. He has delegated all marketing and PR duties to Ben Hakim in order to stay in the office focussing on financial analysis. In addition, the insider trading law-suits have now been settled and his divorce proceedings, initiated in 2017, are now concluded as well ([the financial ripping he reportedly took here may provide additional motivation to improve PSH’s results](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/bill-ackman-divorce)). Overall, many factors look to be lined up for Ackman to return to his winning ways and narrow the discount to NAV.

**Conclusion**

At this point, PSH and more specifically Bill Ackman are effectively distressed assets. The last 3 years of underperformance h[ave put Ackman hate at an all-time high, ](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/is-bill-ackman-toast)[new negative news pieces are written about him everyday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-pulling-bill-ackman-hedge-175352357.html) and [many in the industry are completely dismissing him as an investor](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4048464-ackman-investment-performance-still-horrible-pershing-square-risk). Indeed, this sentiment is perfectly encapsulated by One WallStreetOasis member who refers to him as Bill “destroyer of capital” Ackman.

As with most distressed assets, the rampant negativity prevents most people from looking deeper and analysing the situation objectively. In this case, I have argued analysis reveals an interesting investment opportunity; paying 77 cents on the dollar to gain access to an investor with one of the stronger long term track records (and who only a few years ago was called “Baby Buffett”) and who also seems to have learned from his recent mistakes as his portfolio is up 8.8&#37; this year. Add to this all the catalysts which should act to close the discount to NAV and I believe Ackman’s fall from grace provides savvy investors with a solid investment possessing a clear margin of safety.

t3_8zxujj,Changes at Himalaya Capital?,"Li Lu is a favorite investor of mine, and I've been curious about some of the big changes he's made in his operation lately.

**1. Huge inflow of capital from new investors**

Himalaya managed $2-3 billion for a number of years (their fund was closed for many years), but it now appears their asset base ballooned to over $9B in a very short period (according to their latest[ form ADV 2A](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/Common/crd_iapd_Brochure.aspx?BRCHR_VRSN_ID=487072)).

I view Li Lu as very deliberate, so this makes me wonder what he sees in China and his other relevant geographies. This capital was raised around March this year. 

Scaling an investment operation 3x is a huge endeavor, and it's very hard to build out a quality long book in a short period.

Li Lu even said himself in a Graham and Doddsville interview that any capital he takes in starts compounding at 6% per year (the preferred return for the fund before he earns any incentive fees, and his management fee is budget based, not % based), so he takes accepting capital very seriously.

**2. Himalaya office moved from Pasadena to Seattle.**

This is notable because Li Lu's mentor Charlie Munger lives in Pasadena, which is why he set up shop there.

Does anyone have any additional information on what changes might be going on?",14,0.8,1531937034,"[['ADV', 1]]",ADV,10.399999618530273,10.399999618530273
t3_94ehcl,MTY Food Groups (MTY CN) Long Thesis,"First things first: this is my first time posting to this subreddit and would love any sort of criticism/feedback from you all. I've been lurking this sub (commenting occasionally) for quite some time but would love to be more involved in the future. I recently joined the Discord channel so hit me up there too.

#The Company
MTY Food Group is a small-mid market (~$1.4B CAD market cap at the time of writing this) Canadian quick service restaurant (QSR) company with operations in both the US and Canada. The company is centred around buying smaller, fragmented brands and licensing locations of said brands to franchisees. Among these brands are: 

-	Canada: Baton Rouge, Extreme Pita, ManchuWok, Mr. Sub
-	USA: Baja Fresh, Cold Stone Creamery, Planet Smoothie

*As well as many others.*

MTY currently earns the majority of its revenues from its franchisees via royalties and fees. Approximately 55% of revenues come from Canada, with 45% of revenues coming from USA locations. This capital-light revenue model allows the company to reinvest the cash from thriving restaurants into further acquisitions. Historically, the company has been able to operate this model with huge amounts of success while maintaining a Debt/Equity ratio of ~50% as of Q2 2018. 

#Thesis
MTY Food Group acquires companies with a very strong ROIC, typically in the mid-high teens, allowing the company to earn higher rates of return than same-store sales growth (SSSG) alone would typically provide. Further, MTY typically focuses on smaller acquisitions, and benefits from the overall fragmentation of the North American fast-food and QSR industry. The company has a history using invested capital efficiently to compound growth for shareholders and will continue to do so over time.

The company is currently facing a discount in the market due to recent closing of stores and below-estimate SSSG. I believe that this discount is unwarranted:

-	Closing unprofitable locations creates a better path for growth in the long term.
-	SSSG is less important for MTY due to its highly acquisitive business model and overall brand diversification.

#Valuation
From FY2016 to FY2017, MTY experienced YoY revenue growth of 44%, primarily stemming from $248M cashflow to acquisitions in FY2016. My modelling assumed that the company will continue to make acquisitions at a consistent level over time during its growth phase, beginning with the LTM value as of Q118 and growing at a rate of 15% per year. This is a crucial figure for the company, as it is the main driver of growth and makes up the majority of CapEx. 

With high levels of investment, I modelled strong revenue growth to continue, ramping down from 30% in the projected FY2018 to 5% in FY2023 with a maturity growth rate at the current Canadian risk-free rate of 2.15%. This leads to suppressed FCFF in the growth phase of the company due to the high net CapEx, but high long-term FCFF once investment and growth both begin to taper. I believe that this projection is consistent with both management's strategy (the President & CEO owns 20% of the shares outstanding, motivating him towards long-term growth) and the company's past performance. 

My discount rate was the WACC of the firm, which I found to be 6.14%. This includes a 3% company risk premium assigned to the Cost of Debt due to the nature of the business model. 

Here are the numbers that my model returned, as well as some ration analysis compared to the Restaurants industry averages in the USA:

Price/Book | 2.37 | 77.39
5Y Avg. Rev Gr | 24.22% | 14.11%
Operating Margin | 36.60% | 14.55%

#Risks and Conclusion
My investment thesis for MTY hinges on its ability to deploy capital into exceptional companies into the future. To support this thesis, management (CFO) has been quoted as saying they are unlikely to run out of companies to acquire, specifically in the USA, because of the fragmented nature of the industry and low barriers to entry. I would agree with that statement, and see it as probable that the company will be able to thrive from this growth. 

However, things can go wrong - if MTY is not able to continue to make value-creating acquisitions, this investment thesis will not hold up. With the compelling margin of safety provided by the fulfillment of this thesis, as well as the low valuation ratios relative to other firms in the industry, I am comfortable making that bet on the company and its management.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the quality of this idea and my report.

So the company received $10 million in cash but also gave up $32 million in cash that was offset by some obscure liabilities.

Has anyone been following party city? Stock is down 5% today. 

I think people think that their business is dying and that their announcement to start selling on Amazon is a bad sign.

However, I think selling on Amazon will result in increase revenue. I  have sold items on Amazon and the fees will not be that bad at all. In addition, I highly doubt Amazon will start selling costumes  anytime soon.

Yes people have little brand loyalty when it comes to costumes, but Amazon has many more year-round sellinv items to start making on their list before costumes.

Also, if costumes have such low barriers to entry, why does party city have so few competetiors. Walmart and Target are well aware of the opportunity and always have been.

I also think the Toy City is a very good idea that will help increase revenue. There still is something about buying a toy from a store and a costume.

Costumes only make up a portion of their revenue. I believe plasticware is more...but that's a whole other topic...

I also did a reverse DCF. The market does not think party city will grow much.i am not sure I did it correctly. For net assets I subtracted all liabilities with assets (not including intangible assets, patents, etc.)
To that I added the value from NPV function in Excel with a 2.93% discount rate. I think the net income growth rate I obtained for ~10 years into the future was ~15%

Does anyone have any reports on this company?
What else should I look at? 


Does it have too much debt.

Also, why do they have so much inventory? 600 Mill seems like a lot and I am worried some of it is old stuff that no one will buy anymore like Mitt Romney costumes or something like that.

t3_97329a,My first investment (finally!),"The stock?


Debenhams (LSE:DEB). Of the many people I have spoken to both online and IRL about this, only one person also agreed that it offered potential. Everyone else said that retail was dead, Debenhams was a terrible pick within a terrible market and that I was stupid. I think therefore it's safe to say I've fully taken on-board Mohnish Pabrai's advice in Dhandho Investor to 'buy distressed businesses in distressed industries'.


The investment merits as far as I am concerned are:

•	Other UK bricks & mortar retailers going into administration is creating worry and depressing the stock prices of other retailers.

•	I believe that their business strategy to drive more footfall and cut excess footage by utilising space for gyms and restaurants is a very good idea.

•	There is a focus on Beauty within the business, an industry segment that is growing rapidly.

•	Strong e-com growth, and the CEO, Sergio Bucher, being ex-Amazon gives me confidence they'll continue to do well here.

•	The recent, heavy discounting by other retailers, including House of Fraser hurting profit is likely to reduce now that House of Fraser has found a buyer in Mike Ashley, a 29% owner of Debenhams. The two chains are now less likely to commit mutually destructive acts. Additionally, Mike Ashley is regarded as a great trader so having him as a prominent stakeholder is a plus.

•	Low profit margin, which can be useful in a turnaround business as a small increase in profit margin will have big a big impact on earnings.

o	This is also a big risk if profit margin decreases further, which is a real possibility if the pound continues to fall.


The downsides:

•	Earnings and cash flow have been decreasing for the last 10 years and this negative growth has accelerated in recent years.

o	I believe that the new strategy of the business will begin to turn it around and that if earnings do not grow, the stock is still so undervalued that the investment should still not lose money.

•	There is no discernible durable competitive advantage that stands them out from other big UK retailers.

o	Debenhams has good physical locations across the country and a growing online presence. Due to the relatively straight-forward nature of retail, they will be able to copy the strategy of other retailers if the concept is proved. Bucher’s strategy however is time-consuming to implement and as they will be the first retailers to get a sense of whether or not it worked, they will be in a good place to fully implement this before the arbitrage opportunity of having restaurants/gyms in-store disappears.

•	The overall UK bricks and mortar retail sector is performing poorly and with the ever-growing e-commerce industry posing a huge threat, there is a chance that a snowball effect takes place with high streets emptying resulting in lower footfall and causing more shops to go out of business.

o	The strong e-com growth Debenhams has shown means that if more and more consumers choose to buy their fashion online, it should be able to grow sales further through this channel.


The value:

Share price at purchase = 11.7p (Mkt Cap = £144m)

Estimated earnings for year-end September 2018 = £28m (=£35m PBT * 80%).

LY basic EPS = 4p

At a PE of 5 using estimated earnings (3 using LY earnings) compared with a 5-year median PE of 9.8, the stock is undervalued compared to its historic self and very undervalued compared to its peers.

Mike Ashley paying £90m for a private company with a similar, albeit a bit more high-end, offer to Debenhams that is currently unprofitable and requiring a CVA to continue trading suggests to me he would value Debenhams at a lot more than £144m. In fact, he did value Debenhams at significantly more than £144m when he built up his 30% stake.

The analysts’ consensus of £28m earnings would give a profit margin of 1.2% (assuming revenue stays constant with LY). A 0.1% increase of profit margin would result in an 8% earnings growth, whilst a return to the 5-year median profit margin of 3.7% would yield 208% earnings growth.

I currently believe the stock could easily climb to at least 40p if the company’s strategy allows it to return to revenue growth. Even if this is not the case, the astute trading mentality of Mike Ashley could hopefully provide similar results by increasing profit margin from its current all-time low.

Any feedback/comments are very welcome!

Whilst many of you may disagree with the stock pick, without the reading material supplied through this sub-reddit I wouldn't have had the confidence to take an independent viewpoint on it and certainly would not have put my money where my mouth is! So whether you agree or disagree with the pick, thanks for playing a part in helping me formulate my own investing opinions.

t3_985nss,End Of Brand As A Competitive Advantage,"Currently writing a report on decline of ad industry, it’s impact on consumer brands and the rise of its largest competitor - Amazon

I don’t want to just dump my post in here, so I’ll go through some of my ideas in shorthand. Would love to hear counter-arguments!

Can’t claim all ideas are my own. I’ve taken some from Scott Holloway, but put them in context of ad industry and consumer goods.

Advertising Is A Tax

-on poor people (not paying for Spotify)
-it’s becoming less and less effective 
-regular advertising ‘artificial stories’ can’t compete with digitally native vertical brands (DNVBs - brands which own their supply chain and run tight social media operations (e.g. Dollar Shave Club-esque companies) 
-DNVBs have an advantage, because story-telling costs nothing if done well on instagram, Snapchat or through publicity stunts
-there’s a reason Kylie Jenner’s on track to be liming billionaire - she has more intimidate relationship with audience 

Amazon Own Brand Could Swallow Unilever, P&G etc

-they can produce their stuff at a far lower cost:
1. They cut people out of the supply chain 
2. They don’t need to pay 6-8 bill on kn marketing like big guys, they can advertise on their platform for nothing
3. Their own-brand products are high quality 
4. They will make big companies paying an advertising tax, a supply chain tax and an AWS web tax to use their services. The net result is their products will be cheaper but equally as good 

Spirit Of Innovation 

Consumer goods companies spend almost nothing on innovation. They assume that their brands will keep selling that’s the way it’s always been. Amazon is innovation essentially.

Supply Chain Infrastructure 

-Amazons SCI is dramatically better than the one currently used by consumer goods companies. 
-As Prime grows in popularity, brands will be forced onto Amazon’s platform. 
-Amazon is a false friend, because it will eventually want to promote its own products

I’m not saying Unilever, P&G are instant sells. But I struggle to see how their are 20 year ‘sure-things’. Even look at buffett talking about kraft Heinz recently, I listened to his analysis and honestly struggled to understand anything he was saying. Kraft Heinz looks like an absolute disaster, even with the 3G Midas touch it’s a shambles.

t3_9a19zb,Affiliated Managers Group (AMG),"Just wanted to start a thread here on this stock. 

I've provided a write-up that broadly covers the pro's and con's, questions about valuation, and my own forecasts. CAUTION, some of the data is old, and could potentially be incorrect. 

The main point is not to dissect whether my forecasts are correct, but rather create some discussion around the merits of active management and the competitive position of this particular business. 

Would love to hear well thought out feedback or any questions!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Affiliated Manager's Group (VIC application, March 2017)**

(I think we can agree that active management is a shrinking, not terminally ill, industry) 

Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) is a holding company that derives its revenue from a growing and diverse portfolio of high-quality, high-active share, investment managers they call affiliates.  These affiliates generate revenue, represented by an expense ratio (fees/AUM). AMG runs 836 billion in AUM. This is just about 3x their 2007 size and 9.3x their 2000 size. 

The management team is shareholder friendly and the business will be able to reinvest its earnings for a very long time. The stock has not participated in the general market multiple expansion of the last 5 years and has not yet recovered to previous high's despite record earnings. 

**Business Overview:**

AMG owns non-controlling equity or full ownership of boutique actively managed investment firms, known as affiliates. A boutique is defined as 10% or more owned by employees, less than 100 billion in AUM, high active share, and at least a 5 year track record. Active share is a measure of the percentage of stock holdings in a manager's portfolio that differs from the benchmark index. 

This is further broken into 550 unique investment products. 75% of AUM is derived from institutions and high-net worth individuals. About 50% of AUM is domiciled outside the U.S, which surpasses many peers by orders of magnitude. Crucially, most of this AUM is in separately managed accounts ""SMA's"". SMA's have the advantage of being more difficult to withdraw from, but they also demand less fees - it focuses on maintaining the longevity of investor capital rather than trying to squeeze out as much fees as possible.

AMG offers an appealing platform for independent firms: Unlike Legg Mason or Federated, AMG does not re-brand or interfere with the investment culture of any affiliate. In fact, AMG has emphasized a desire to maintain each affiliate's culture and retain investment and management teams. AMG will try to help it grow by providing access to their international distribution channel and outsourcing marketing, reporting, and other administrative functions as a supplementary service.

Execution of this mandate is best illustrated by the length of time affiliates have been in AMG's portfolio, which often spans more than 10 years, the accompanying track records, and AMG's continued ability to attract high-caliber investment firms to partner with (the last 2 years provides numerous examples). Acquisition success likely attracts more talent, creating contagious network effects. Employment contracts with newly acquired affiliates can require up to 10 years of commitment from incumbent management, ensuring acquired affiliates are aligned with a long-term outlook. Often times AMG will optionally provide a seed investment in the fund itself to sweeten the deal.

AMG reportedly has 1500 existing relationships with potential acquisition targets that over the course of many years have been developed.

AMG's investment injects affiliate owners with liquidity but also leaves them with significant rights to future cash flows, an attractive deal for owners looking to potentially move on or think about succession. The latter is not a unique quality per se, but AMG has a significant edge in consummating deals given their decades long practice doing it vs peers who’ve only recently started.

AMG may also be one of only a few asset managers with capacity or wherewithal to acquire sophisticated investment firms looking for a permanent lot to park their businesses. I was surprised to see that Legg Mason and Federated Investors are the only other players who’ve been active in M&A over the last 5 years. Larger players like BlackRock are letting their active divisions go and focusing on passive, quantitative, and in-house development, so is Invesco and State Street, but T. Rowe, Gamco, Eaton Vance, and some of the smaller competitors have yet to prove themselves formdiable. I suspect there’s some form of potential cannibalization with existing funds that would occur if those kinds of firms were to acquire affiliates.

Finally, the CEO, Sean Healey, has been with the company since 1995, was promoted in 2005 to CEO, became Chairman in 2011. He has a Harvard Law background and considered going into academia. He possesses 117,000 shares and has a large portion of his compensation made out in equity. He’s still only 55 and has over 20 million of his wealth locked up in AMG’s stock. Since current management took over, the team has demonstrated prudent decision making and resilience in the face of crises; they are time weathered. Recent conference calls indicate they are scaling back acquisitions, especially in private equity as they see valuation multiples stretching out.

**Absolute Valuation:**

AQR:

Around 15% of AMG’s EPS and 25% of AUM is due to AQR. Acquired in 2004, this firm has grown AUM 23.6% annually since and currently employs 815 people and runs about 195 billion. Industry forecasts suggest AQR will grow AUM 15-20% annually for the next 5-10 years. The result: 3-5% boost to AMG’s earnings annually so by 2023 AQR would have about 600 billion in AUM and 6$ of contributing EPS. Quantitative firms are one of the very few sectors in the active investment industry that is growing rapidly. AMG is obviously aware of this, management has discussed it on conference calls. Quant firms have grown AUM from around 7% in 2014, to around 14% in 2017.

Core Affiliates:

Firms include: Tweedy Browne, ValueAct, Winton Capital, Harding Loevner, Blue Moutnain Group, and various non-controlled and controlled affiliates. 

85% of EPS and 75% of AUM is comprised of this group. I assume a below trend, 1-1.5% AUM organic growth rate for the next 6 years. Some of these funds have tripled or quadrupled since partnering with AMG over their life, indicating that either AMG is able to identify promising affiliates, or indicating that they have a network and resources that significantly benefit affiliates. 

In virtually all affiliate relationships, AMG has optionality to increase ownership and or the owners may “put” their equity to AMG at certain time intervals if certain performance criteria are met. 

This is important because it enables AMG to reinvest earnings into and throughout a deep and growing pool of existing investment manager relationships. Additionally, non-controlled affiliates, represented by equity method income, seem to be providing much higher expense ratios than AMG’s consolidated affiliates - perhaps because the consolidated affiliates are weighted down by mutual fund expense ratios, whereas the new investments are directed toward higher charging funds. 

The bottom line is that current expense ratios have defensible characteristics, (see risk section). AMG has optionality to stabilize them in the near-term via reinvestments into higher fee managers.

While my estimated growth rate for core affiliates is significantly below historical trend, it could easily be lower if passive index funds somehow begin compounding faster than the last few years of 12% annually. However, AMG has levers to avoid competing with passive as a growing 39% of AMG’s core is in alternative funds. 

Acquisitions: 

If an average of 650 million is spent each year for the next 6 years, EPS would increase roughly $4.50 by 2023. AMG has historically compounded AUM at roughly 15%, but a large part of that was acquisitions related. AMG has averaged 667 million in capital expenditures annually since 2010, adding on average 3-4 new affiliates per year. Management guides that for every $100 million spent on growth, there should be $.1 to $0.14 of EPS accretion. Financially able, AMG has generated over 1 billion in FCF before acquisitions each year since 2014, and reduced leverage, essentially leaving the business with $468 million in cash and declining interest expenses.

Shareholder friendly initiatives: 

In the first 6 months of 2017, AMG repurchased around 1.33 million shares for $200 million, repaid $85 million in debt, and initiated a $44 million annual dividend that could easily be 1-2%, but is currently a .5% yield and far below peers. Shareholder initiatives should add at least $1 in EPS cumulatively by 2023.

Summing up:

By 2023, I expect around $19.5 in GAAP TTM EPS plus at least a 1% dividend yield. On a 16x 2023 TTM earnings multiple I am getting a price of around $300. I did not calculate the more aggressive “economic earnings per share”, which in some cases is 5$ more than GAAP, but still trades on 14x valuation multiples.

Base case - 2023 outlook (5-year)

1. AQR AUM 190 → 600, EPS $1.9 → $6
2. Core AUM 575 → 620 billion, EPS $7.6 → $8
3. Acquisitions → $4.2 billion capex, EPS --> $5.25 

If you add it all up, by 2023: AUM 765 → 1,187 ex acquisitions, GAAP EPS $9.5 → GAAP EPS $19.25

**Relative Valuation:**

According to FactSet, AMG historically trades at an 8% discount NTM PE relative to the S&P 500. Today it trades at a 38% discount NTM PE relative to the S&P 500 and 23.5% discount to it’s historical “economic earnings” multiple of 14.23x. The last time valuation compressed like this was in 2008 and 2003. They trade roughly in line with “peers” on an absolute basis. 

On a relative valuation, the market is trading at a 61% premium while growing 20% slower! Factset reports a market 3-year forward pe of 14.5x and 11.6% EPS growth rate vs AMG’s 8.65x EPS and 13.3% growth rate. AMG also trades well below its historical average.

**Risks:**

They have historically incurred a lot of debt to grow: 6.2 billion issued since 2012. But they’ve also generated 5.3 billion over the same period in operating cash flow. They don’t issue debt every year however and they don't to given their low fixed costs capital structure - they only rasie debt when they expect to make acquisitions, which has been the situation over the last 5 years and will likely repeat itself over the next 5 years if there's consolidation in response to industry difficulties.

Consolidation will be catalyzed from active management outflows and increased regulation. There’s been a notable uptick in consolidation within the broad sector already. Peers like Legg Mason, Federated Investors, BlackRock or even major bank holding companies like Goldman Sachs’ asset management division have gone through significant M&A activity. To sum up, especially for active managers, there’s a necessity to consolidate in anticipation of losing AUM to passive products and to gain some scale or safety from expected increased regulation like the DOL fiduciary rule or brokerage commissions transparency.

A stock market shock isn't life-threatening. AMG has proven to be highly stable over long-periods of time. In 01 and 09 AMG's business temporarily collapsed via outflows, cash flow returns on total capital fell by 50%, and 30% respectively, from the prior year. That said, pre-tax margins never fell below 15% and AMG has historically added the majority of their AUM in the aftermath of recessions. Despite two of the possibly worst market bubbles in US history, they’ve compounded FCF at 15% annualized since 1999.

There should be concern about the longevity of active managed funds but investors should also carefully consider the stickiness of client interests in AMG’s existing portfolio and the quality of affiliates themselves. The constituent base is growing in institutional and in alternative allocations, but even the retail base is in mutual funds have outperformed the market over the life of those funds.

Expense Ratios:

Expense ratios will likely deteriorate over the long-term. For every basis point of expense ratio deterioration, AMG will lose more revenue for basis point lower. But, the extent of damage to AMG should be muted by the alternative portfolio, AQR, and the high-quality core affiliates. Furthermore, expense ratio deterioration, while it has been trending down, is not that bad. 

ICI indicates that expense ratios have deteriorated at about 1.67% per year for equity mutual funds since 1996, translating to an average of 2.1 basis points per year. The caveat here is that AMG is diversifying into active alternatives which generally provide both uncorrelated performance, command higher fees, and have longer lock-up periods. The result of their strategic foray into alternatives in recent years has set them up for better long-term durability and an improved expense ratio complex.

AMG’s aggregate expense ratio (Aggregate Revenue/ Average AUM) charged to clients was .66% in 2016, but will likely remain stable to slightly increase in 2017 due to a transformative 2016 acquisition spree and positive hedge fund performance YTD. This compares to a .71% expense ratio in 2012, or a decrease of roughly 1.25 basis points per year. A closer look reveals that the expense ratio from consolidated affiliates has decreased from .47% to .33% or 3.5 basis points over the same period and expense ratios from equity method affiliates has decreased from .87% to .74% or 3.25% per year.

Why haven’t expense ratios decreased 3.3 basis points per year since 2012?

The reason overall expense ratios aren’t going down as quickly is because AMG has been acquiring equity method affiliates much faster than consolidated affiliates effectively stabilizing the expense ratio. Furthermore, 69.5% of Net Income available to common was derived from equity method affiliates, and roughly 60 billion in equity method affiliate AUM was acquired, which will show up in H2 17/H1 18 according to management.

Why are equity method affiliate expense ratios 40 basis points higher? How stable are they?

Equity method affiliates are largely composed of alternative strategies such as private equity and quantitative hedge fund firms, and thus can generally command higher premiums for performance than mutual funds, which comprise consolidated affiliate AUM. Equity method affiliate acquisitions have been a strategic focus for AMG’s management team because of the higher expense ratios achieved. All of 2016’s acquisitions were alternatives and I believe management will continue diversifying their portfolio into these kinds of strategies until they don’t need to.

**Other Notes (in no particular order, some are repetitive)**

● They generate predictable cash streams because of significant exposure to sticky separately managed accounts (SMA’s), which is approximately 75% of AUM. SMA’s are generally less liquid than an ETF, so in a sense slightly more stable than an index fund.

● During the first 15 years of existence AMG accumulated 381 billion in AUM, but another 390 billion has arrived over the last 5 years. In other words, they’re growing AUM at 3x the historical rate. It would be unjust to speculate why specifically, but I suspect AMG’s long track record of success and reputation was a catalyst.

● In 2016 AMG had a gross expense ratio of 65.5 basis points. This compares to a typical expense ratio of over 1% for the average mutual fund, a 60% premium to AMG’s, and a likely competitive factor against ETF’s.

● Returns on invested capital (acquisition expenditures primarily) are enhanced by management's’ ability to prudently acquire affiliates at good prices, return capital to shareholders when M&A is too hot, and score a few home runs along the way, i.e AQR.

● AMG is particularly attractive to international funds seeking a distribution channel into US capital, and likewise US investors can use international funds to access emerging markets expertise. Close to 50% of AUM is already domiciled out of the US and as of recently acquisitions seem to be more and more frequently sourced from abroad.

● Since AMG does not rebrand or interfere with the investment culture of their affiliates, often times when auctions occur prospective affiliates simply choose AMG at whatever price is offered

t3_9af9lg,Mulberry Short Thesis,"**Company Overview**

Mulberry is a UK based luxury fashion company that makes leather goods (90% of revenue), mainly handbags (70%). The company was founded in 1971, employs 1,400 FTE (mostly in the UK) and makes approx. 50% of handbags at two Somerset factories, employing 650 FTE. The rest of production is outsourced overseas. The business strategy is to continue growing handbag sales and in the long-term expanding into other categories including footwear, accessories and men’s leather goods.

**Financials**

Share Price = 434p

Market Cap = £257.8m

Revenue = £170m (5yr CAGR = 1%, 10yr = 13%)

Earnings = £4.9m (5yr CAGR = -23%, 10yr = 4%)

Equity = £88m (5yr CAGR = 2%, 10yr = 15%)

Profit margin = 2.9% (gross profit margin = 63.5%)

Charts: https://imgur.com/a/i1v2xm9

**The investment merits:**

•	Mulberry is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 52.5, despite an Earnings 5-year CAGR of -23%.

•	Revenue has only grown by 0.6% CAGR since 2013. This is driven by a steady drop in Wholesale revenue and little growth in total UK retail sales (as this composes digital and in-store sales, in-store sales revenue must be falling).

•	2018 Earnings of £4.9m are likely to be substantially lower in 2019 due to a number of reasons:

1) £3m cost associated with House of Fraser’s administration.

2) If as expected up to half of House of Fraser’s stores close, Mulberry’s wholesale revenue will also be significantly affected as House of Fraser concessions (21) represent 47% of Mulberry’s total concessions.

3) The company is launching into a partnership in South Korea that will entail c. £3m in costs in 2018/19. Whilst in the long-run this may be a strong revenue growth area for the company, in the short term it will have a negative impact on the bottom line.

4) Mulberry has stated that in the short term it plans to strategically refine and enhance its store network. This is likely to result in significant costs incurred over the coming financial years.

5) Mulberry has also stated that if the UK market continues as it is, the company’s full-year profit for 2019 will be materially reduced.

•	Compared to Burberry, probably the closest UK publicly traded company to Mulberry, the fundamentals look very poor, aside from Price to Sales and Price to Equity.

o	Price to Earnings: Mulberry = 52.5 | Burberry = 33.7

o	ROIC: M = 4.1% | B = 12.9%

o	Profit margin: M = 2.9% | B = 10.5%

o	Price to Operating Cash Flow: M = 22.6 | B = 14.3

o	Price to Sales: M = 1.5 | B = 3.6

o	Price to Equity: M = 2.9 | B = 6.8


**The downsides:**

•	International and digital revenue are both growing steadily, both growing at an 11% CAGR since 2013, which may partially offset the increased costs over the coming years.

•	The company has no debt, either short or long-term which will be helpful in weathering rough years.

•	The 5-year CAGR in earnings to 2012 was 46% (revenue = 28%). If the business returns to these rates, its current valuation is likely warranted.


**Summary:**

At a PE of 52.5 (PEG ratio = 98.9) using 2017/18 earnings, the business seems to me to be valued using the growth rates it experienced leading up to 2012. Additionally, the Return on Invested Capital of 4% shows that the business has not been successful in turning its capital into earnings over the last 4 years. I believe it is highly probable that 2018/19 earnings will be lower than 17/18 and as such investors will re-value the stock using recent years’ performance as opposed to the optimistic valuation based on previous years. Even a PE ratio of 30 and assuming no earnings decrease next year, the share price would still drop by 43%. (PE of 20 = 62%).

-----------------------------

Very keen to hear people's thoughts on this. **I do not actually plan on shorting the company** as I don't have the facilities to do this and generally don't want to engage in any gamble with a theoretically unlimited upside but will be following the story over the next year to see how this plays out.


One question I do have for more learned investors than myself on this forum is: the top 3 shareholders of Mulberry account for 92% of outstanding shares. After that and the Chairman's 1.2%, there are 4 million shares outstanding. Is this reduced liquidity likely a key factor in the company's high valuation? If so, should one of these stakeholders decide they want to invest elsewhere, would the stock price suffer a severe drop?

Hawaiian Airlines (HA): Key reason - good company, trading cheaply. Investment caught my eye because of cheap valuations. Airline is rated most 'punctual airline' in the country, niche player that has 80% market share of interisland market. Beaten down due to news Southwest might enter the westcoast-hawaii market and the interisland market. Consistent growth (top and bottom line) over the last 10 years, with Roe of 40%+ and ROIC of 26%+ (on the higher side for industry). Is one of the few survivors of a very competitive market that has seen a lot of bankruptcies. FCF can be inconsistent in years when they are investing in new airlines, but on a steady state, typically generates 1x FCF/Net Income. My valuations: DCF put fair value 40-50% above current value. on a P/E basis, trading at 1.4x cheaper than competitors.

Standard Chartered Bank (Stan.L): Key reason - deep value.  An incredibly strong brand in emerging markets and a stalwart in ASEAN/China region. In 2014 bank went through turmoil that slammed top and bottom line. They were bending over backwards to do business with whoever would have them, and this led to several unprofitable business and severe fines and investigations from several countries (including the United States - Iran sanctions).  Mgmnt was reshuffled, and Bill Winters (ex JPM and seen at one time as potential successor to Jaime Dimon) is appointed in 2015 as CEO. He took an axe to the business, reshaping/selling/slashing. Top and bottom line have started to recover, but at time of investment P/B was trading at a 40-80% discount to comparative banks (depending if you compared them to Global, Asian, European, or American banks). Key catalyst for recovery from deep value: They need to bring their costs down.

Lear Corp (LEA): Key reason - Great company, trading at a healthy discount to fair value. Makes seating and electrical systems/parts for auto companies like Ford, GM, FCA. Consistent trajectory, growing 7-9% per year (top and bottom), FCF of $1.2bn, ROIC at 24%+ , last quarter was a record breaking quarter in terms of results. Second largest market share in industry. Moat is driven by stickiness of customers (Auto companies spend a long time on Due diligence, preproduction validation, etc before choosing a supplier), extensive R&D in 'smart' systems for cars (preparing for increase of electric or SDV), and efficient scale (production spread across the world to service clients globally). A high proportion of facilities located in low-cost countries which also gives it a cost advantage. My DCF valuation put it at 20-30% discount to FV, and P/E trading around 30% discount to competitor.

t3_9fdyzu,FNJN: A cheap patent troll - Long thesis,"**Background**

Finjan Holdings Inc. (FNJN) is a micro-cap, cyber security intellectual property licensing and enforcement firm. If you not familiar with IP licensing firms, think “patent troll.” Finjan currently owns 53 US patents and 38 international patents. Of these patents, 24 were recently acquired (Aug. 2017) from IBM to form a new partnership, and have yet to be monetized. The company has a few wholly owned subsidiaries, one of which sales a mobile VPN product to consumers and enterprises, another of which offers cyber security consulting services. Neither of which have ever earned any income. Finjan earns all its profits from licensing and enforcement. The company IPOed in 2014.

&#x200B;

**Financials/Valuation**

As of September 12, FNJN is trading around $4.05 per share with a market cap near $112 million and $65 million cash on hand. At 27.5 million of float, that is around $2.36 cash per share. Over the last 4 quarters they have generated $105.5 million in revenue and $60.5 million in EBITDA. It is a trading on an EV/EBITDA multiple is less than 1. By nearly every standard measure this is a cheap stock.

&#x200B;

**Why is FNJN cheap?**

The primary reason is the fact that Finjan’s income and expenses are highly uncertain and can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Many think that Finjan will have little success in winning new settlements and will spend all of its cash of long drawn out jury trials (a jury trial costs the company between $1 and $2 million per quarter). Additionally, as is, the firm’s theoretical earning potential is time-bound, as each patent has a lifespan. Altogether this makes Finjan a difficult company to value. However, for the reasons below, I think FNJN is an excellent buy.

&#x200B;

**Why Long?**
FNJN is cheap. While I don’t think too much consideration should be given to valuation metrics, FNJN is so cheap that it doesn’t have to perform all that well for the stock to outperform. The company is priced as if it will only win 1 or 2 medium sized settlement awards and will not increase any licensing deals in the next 2-3 years. If this is true, then you shouldn’t buy. On the other hand, if Finjan can win several settlements/awards in the next few years or increase licensing or secure new patents to extend the company’s time horizon, then the stock will appreciate considerably and you should buy. Below I present some evidence why I think Finjan will do better than most think as well as some additional considerations.

&#x200B;

**Increasing licensing and court awards**

· Finjan has aggressively pursued licensing and should increase revenue to $200-$400 million in the next 3-4 years from existing patents (based on the company’s projection). The company has increased annual revenues each of the last 4 years

· Most of the existing licensing contracts have “pricing protection” which could increase payouts based on the licensees’ use (some of this is included in the above figure)

· The FinjanBlue program with IBM has 24 patents that are untapped

· The company has a strong track record of defending patents and favorable court rulings. As this continues it could make competitors more willing to settle

· The company has proved many times that it can secure new patents and looks for well priced opportunities

&#x200B;

**Cash And Valuation**

· The board authorized a $10 million buyback program in FY18 Q2, $2 million of stock have already been purchased

· The company recognizes awards in the quarter when it was awarded, not when it was paid - meaning that cash on the balance sheet doesn’t reflect the full amount of earnings

· Finjan's management has shown a strong interest in returning capital to shareholders, including the possibility of one time distributions

**Other Considerations**

· There is a possibility of an acquirer or other partnership – the company's financials and portfolio make it attractive to competitors and the company has retained Atlas Technology (a Silicon Valley investment bank). As explained on the most recent earnings call “strategic options have presented themselves.” There are many larger IP firms or technology companies who could potentially seek a partnership or acquisition

· The business model should be minimally effected by market conditions as Finjan’s revenue is generated by “captive” payers (don’t like the term recession-proof)

· Finjan has the possibility to generate additional revenue from its subsidiaries. While I don’t place much faith in Finjan Mobile’s VPN product, it is currently undergoing a re-brand as “Invincibull” and the company is pursuing enterprise customers

· More promising is Finjan’s $5 million VC investment with JVP. Not only might this produce a solid return but also gives Finjan access to cutting edge cyber security tech

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

To sum it up, if Finjan can generate earnings anywhere close to what they have done recently then the stock should increase significantly. I am confident in management ability to aggressively license, enforce, and grow its IP portfolio. ",9,0.84,1536804193,"[['IP', 3], ['IBM', 2], ['VC', 1]]",IP,52.619998931884766,54.95000076293945
t3_9hd1ch,Analyzing negative cash flow companies,"Hello All,

One thing i see a lot of value investors place a high importance on is free cash flow.  For this reason, when I see companies that have a pattern of negative free cash flow, I typically stay away from them. For example, GM, HTZ, and CAR are 3 tickers I've looked at that have large negative free cash flows.  My main question is how do you guys view companies that have consistently large negative free cash flow companies?  Those that have bought these companies recently, do you care about free cash flow?  In your opinion are there other numbers on financial statements you place higher importance on?  Do you expect the FCF to turn positive for these companies?

t3_9ipl0b,Diamond Hill Capital (DHIL) Thesis and Valuation Draft,"Hello. I’m looking for some guidance on my investment thesis and valuation of Diamond Hill Capital.

**Overview**

Diamond Hill (NASDAQ: DHIL) is a Columbus, Ohio-based asset manager with $22 billion AUM as of September 5th, 2018. They have a market cap of around 570M and are currently trading at $162.70, down 20% YTD. The equity is trading at a 4.9x EV/EBIT multiple and a 10x P/E multiple. 

The firm is an investment advisor employing a research team of 48 individuals that publicly manage 11 public equity funds, 4 public fixed income funds, and 2 private hedge funds. Their CEO since 2000, Ric Dillon, stepped down at the end of 2017 in a planned exit from the firm. Their most recent fund was the Diamond Hill Global Fund, which was introduced at the end of 2017. Most of the AUM is invested into their Large Cap strategy, with 11.56B dedicated to that particular function. Their second greatest weight is in their Long-Short strategy, at 4.30B. 

Though they sit at the oft-maligned intersection of active management and value investing, the great majority of their funds have managed to outperform their respective benchmarks on a lifetime basis, although recent performance has been comparatively poor. This has not prevented their total AUM from growing. From 2007 to 2017, their total ending AUM CAGR has been 12.11%. 

The firm has annually distributed a special dividend for the past 10 years, returning a nominal amount of $211M back to shareholders. Buybacks are rarely implemented—the last was in 2011. 

**Safety**

The business is very capital light and generates high free cash flow. 

Management is diversifying their holdings, explaining the launch of a global equity fund. Along similar lines, the fixed income portfolios are doing well, possibly prompting more marketing efforts in that area.

Employees have their interests aligned with the firm. Compensation is tied to performance after 5 years and involve options as well as cash incentives. 

**Risks**

The investment portfolio of $205M is subject to market volatility.

Market downturn would affect their cash flow generation as well as their investment portfolio.

Key personnel may leave, leading to poor performance, leading to more departures.

Secular headwinds in the asset management industry as a whole.

**Valuation**

DCF File: https://www.dropbox.com/s/55jfby7zbcrzanb/DHIL_Financials.xlsx?dl=0

Given a general lack of guidance in valuing an asset manager, I tried to fit the firm’s operations into a more traditional DCF valuation. Given that my numbers are indicating a 37% upside with a terminal FCF growth rate of -6.6%, my valuation is deeply flawed. 

My projections tied revenues to a percentage of total ending AUM, as this relationship has remained fairly consistent, hovering around .60%. Compensation and Sales and Marketing expenses were both tied to revenue, while G&A and Mutual Fund Administration expenses were tied to AUM. I looked at the covariance in those relationships and aimed to project the relationships that fluctuated the least for each.

* *Base Case Assumptions*

My base case assumes 1% CAGR in Ending AUM for the next 10 years. 

Investment advisory fees decline from .60% to .58% over the next 10 years. 

* *Upside Case Assumptions*

1% growth in ending AUM in year 1.

The following numbers come from the 2017 PwC report on Asset Management, specifically the North American AUM growth projections. 

5.7% growth in years 2 and 3. 

4% growth til year 8 and 2% growth after. 

Fees stabilize at .60% over the next 10 years.

* *Downside Case Assumptions*

1% growth in year 1. 25% decline in AUM year 2. 2% growth til year 10.

Fees decline from .60% to .51% over 10 years. 

**Peer Comparisons**

There were constraints on the peer group: these were some of the only companies that I could find the forward earnings projections for. I chose Manning and Napier (MN), Pzena Investment Management (PZN), Virtus Investment Partners (VRTS), and Victory Capital Holdings (VCTR) for the peer comparisons. They have AUM ranging from 23B to 63B, which I thought was a decent range, and market cap ranging from 600M to 1B with the exception of Manning, which has a market cap of 40M due to the common stock only having a 17.8% claim on the actual investing business. 
I looked at the companies primarily through EV/EBIT multiples. The median LTM multiple was 8.6x, but the projections saw a decrease after two years to 7.6x. On the other hand, DHIL’s LTM EV/EBIT multiple was 4.9x, decreasing to 4.8x over the same period. 

**Conclusion**

Given their ability to attract capital inflows, Diamond Hill’s low multiple seems unjustified. While the numbers on the DCF do not seem trustworthy by any means, I think they definitely are pointing in the right direction. 

**Next Steps**

I am unsure what quantitative or qualitative factors I should take a deeper look at. I am comfortable reaching out to IR but am looking for feedback on where to go with my analysis. General advice on how to form an investment thesis would be appreciated, as well as ideas on how to troubleshoot a DCF.

**Vistra Energy Corp (VST) – $22.45 on Oct. 23, 2018**

A recently spun-off entity of Energy Future Holdings, the largest LBO and bankruptcy in history, VST is an integrated power producer with the lowest cost of operations in the nation, lowest levered company in the industry, and either the #1 or #2 player in the retail and wholesale power market in Texas. 

When the company IPO’d in 2016, a majority of its stock was owned by its creditors coming out of the bankruptcy. (Brookfield, Apollo, and Oaktree) Management has stated in earnings calls that the creditors are urging the company to diversify its shareholder base so that the creditors can rotate out their stock. Despite the creditors trying to rotate \~7B in stock, the stock has doubled since 2016.

Management has tried their best to attract new investors whom they might have lost from the bankruptcy. VST returned 1B in capital to shareholders in 2016 and the board has approved 500m in buybacks for 2018. Management has hinted at a recurring growing dividend starting at 3-4% coming soon.

With the recent merger with Dynegy (all stock with value of around $1.7B or 60,000/MW of capacity, majority CCGT plants, compared to 895,000/MW to build a new CCGT plant), the company has $10.387B in debt. VST plans on paying off $3.6B of debt by YE2019 with its free cash flow to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5x. The company hopes to achieve investment grade status to lower its cost of debt, attract more institutional investors, and lower its cost to hedge.

The clarity in VST’s earnings and cash flow come from their ability to hedge natural gas prices and heat rates well before they are required to deliver. Having one of the lowest cost of operations in industry provides ample margin of safety, as well as having the retail business. One of the great things about the integrated power model is that one is not coupled to either the wholesale or the retail market’s prices. If retail customers see their cost of electricity increase, they will flock to the wholesale markets, and vice versa. Because VST is the biggest player in both, they see stable earnings regardless of price fluctuations.

In addition, VST has the advantage in the retail markets due to its size and integrated model. Because retail customers hate seeing their power prices increase, especially in the summer during peak demand, VST is able to smooth out prices for their retail customers. Other retail players in the market cannot do this because they are too small and do not have the capital or extra capacity required. It is not unreasonable to expect VST’s retail business to grow in the future. 

A quick summary of management, the CEO has 35 years experience in all of the power markets. He emphasizes VST’s rigorous investment discipline of a hurdle rate 600 basis points above cost of capital and commitment to being the lowest cost and leveraged operator.

**What’s the upside?**

The company is currently valued according to management’s guidance for 2018-2019, with EBITDA growing at 1% thereafter. There is a lot of room for potential actions that will be accretive to the stock , such as buybacks or acquisitions, that are not priced in. With 1B in 2019 and 6B in 2022 of cash available for allocation, the probability of something good happening is fairly high.

**What’s the downside?**

The plants are valued at 20% of overnight capital cost, or the cost of a new plant if it were to appear overnight. Guidance is close to certain, as the company hedges out earnings 2 years ahead.

Management expects the markets to tighten as there are not many new CCGT plants being planned for the next 2-3 years. That means that power prices should increase in the next few years during peak demand.

The newbuild of wind in ERCOT is unlikely to effect VST because wind is not generated during peak demand hours. For wind to be competitive with VST’s CCGT plants, batteries must also be installed along side the renewables, yet there is no forecast for future battery storage in ERCOT.

Solar is still a non-player in Texas, and wind is starting to reach its potential in the best locations for generation. 

Other risks include plant outages, management going against their word to accrue large amount of debt, and regulatory risk.

**Why does this opportunity exist?**

With a daily volume of 5 - 6 million shares, I believe the shareholder base is diversifying and the creditors are selling. This is why the price wiggles around 23. Management still needs to earn investors’ trust back after the bankruptcy, so it will take some time and results to see sentiment around VST change. There are also biases against VST with the current atmosphere around renewables and clean energy. The utilities industry is also not known for high growth and may still have a bad taste in investors’ mouths.

t3_9y9gng,Thoughts on American Axle & Manufacturing (NYSE:AXL),"Hey, I wrote my thoughts down on AAM after its Q3 earnings, let me know where I can improve, thoughts on what I wrote, or anything I got wrong/missed.  

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 

American Axle & Manufacturing (NYSE: AXL) is an OEM parts distributor for auto companies across the United States.  They currently supply parts for General Motors (GM), Jaguar, Nissan, and are OEMs for various other supply companies.  Due to the nature of automotive manufacturing, it is important to note that this company is a long-term hold.  In the automotive industry, it is common for the time between shipment and receiving money to be longer than 6 months.  As a result, companies can have a large accounts receivable at any given time.  With that in mind, let’s dive into why AXL will be a good hold.

1. Book price per share of $16.445

First thing off the bat is a book per share higher than the stock price as of writing (currently at $11.66).  Normally, book per share is the minimum a company should be valued at, by calculating its assets and subtracting the liabilities.  This, divided by outstanding shares, is the value of all assets the company holds.  This means that if the company sold all its assets to pay to its investors, each investor would receive the book per share price.  As such, the price should eventually rise to this price, as it has been hovering around that price for a while.

2.   Decreased dependence on General Motors

Normally, a company that supplies only to one company will move in step with the company it is supplying for.  And for a while, GM was 66% of AXL’s business.  This means that if GM were to move on, they would lose the lion’s share of its revenues.  While unlikely, this move would completely shut down the company.  However, in 2017, GM only accounted for 47% of AXL’s revenue, a 19% decrease.  This was not due to GM; rather, it was due to AXL’s acquirement of MPG, another OEM like AXL.  This move will help them in the long run by diversifying its customer base, allowing it both more market share as well as hedges against uncertainty in the supply chain.

3.  Position as OEM to big brands creates a high wall of entry for competitors

AXL’s nature as an OEM helps them greatly in retaining customers.  Generally, when an automotive company picks an OEM, it becomes difficult to switch up partners, simply due to how intensive the production of these cars is.  Unlike markets such as electronics, there aren’t as many producers of specific parts for cars due to the cost of it.  So picking an OEM is basically a proposal for most companies.  This shows with AXL’s track record, winning GM’s 2016 Supplier of the Year award and maintaining the lion’s share of GM’s business.  With their acquisition of MPG bringing them new large customers, AXL has a clear path for additional revenue in the future.

4.  The company’s own people are buying it

When the company’s own people sip their Kool-Aid, the company is either drunk of their own power, or they believe that they still have a solid company.  With AXL, I believe it is the latter.  Due to lackluster Q3 results, the stock dropped from its ranging $15-17 dollar range to around $11 dollars.  Despite this setback, many of the company’s leaders bought shares after the dip, including the CEO purchasing a million dollars worth of stock.  The company and its people believe in the long-term growth of the company, and they are more incentivized now to produce as well as they have been for the last few years.

5.  Sales for end of 2018 are looking on track

The third quarter for AXL is looking to shape up to how it was for Q4 of 2017.  Their driveline segment is on par for last year, with roughly 3.2 billion dollars in sales so far, only 800 million short of Q4 last year.  Meanwhile, its metal forming unit has produced sales by Q3 this year that almost outstrip Q4 for AXL last year(1.176b vs 1.242).  Its other segments, powertrain, and casting, have both beaten Q4 results from last year already.  This shows that the diversification of AXL is paying off already, increasing sales in multiple segments for the company.

t3_9zylyp,Learning about valuation and wanting to cross-check my current understanding,"New investor here and as the title suggest, I would like to cross-check some of the knowledge I recently acquired to identify gaps as I move forward learning about security analysis.

My understanding is that when it comes to valuation there are 2 main approaches: Intrinsic and Relative valuation.

**Intrinsic Valuation**

The value of the asset is estimated by its cash flow, growth and risk. The EIL5 version is that the asset value is relative to how well we project the company will do in the future. This requires a few assumptions like ROE, Growth Rate and FCF. DCF is the common approach to find a stock's intrinsic value to which there are many variations: DDM, FCFE and FCFF.

**Relative Valuation**

The value of the asset is estimated relative to its peers group market value. The EIL5 version would be to compare it to paying for a house. One would pay for a house after scouting what the next door houses sell for and adjust price expectations accordingly. The same applies for stocks.

To do relative valuation we need a standardized price to be used to compare assets since the market value of the stock is in some ways a function of the number of outstanding shares. So to normalize the price for comparison, it is divided by some value that directly relates to the company valuation such as earnings for example (i.e: a multiple). The reason to use company valuation is because relative valuation assumes that assets within the same peer group shares similar cash flows, growth and risks.

Some examples of relative valuations are: P/E, P/B, EV/EBIT etc. Those can be used to compare assets directly within the same peer group or compare the multiple of the asset against the multiple of the entire peer group average.

That being said, since not every company is made equal such a company can have a higher growth than the average expected growth of its peer, we need another multiple to account for growth differences which otherwise would make companies with unusual high growth have high price to earnings compared to the average. One way to do this is the PEG ratio which is basically taking the PE divided by the expected growth. The ELI5 version is that such as we normalize the market value relative to valuation criteria, we account for growth difference by normalizing the multiples to the growth to have an adjusted metric for comparison across a set of assets.

I'm usually looking for undervalued securities that trade at a discount to their intrinsic value, particularly in small caps and spin-offs.

t3_a2cs95,Buffett and EBITDA: Chairman's Letter-1989,"As a copy-paste from his 1989 shareholder's letter:  


&#x200B;

""But as happens in Wall Street all too often, what the wise 

do in the beginning, fools do in the end. In the last few years 

zero-coupon bonds (and their functional equivalent, pay-in-kind 

bonds, which distribute additional PIK bonds semi-annually as 

interest instead of paying cash) have been issued in enormous 

quantities by ever-junkier credits. To these issuers, zero (or 

PIK) bonds offer one overwhelming advantage:  It is impossible to 

default on a promise to pay nothing. Indeed, if LDC governments 

had issued no debt in the 1970's other than long-term zero-coupon 

obligations, they would now have a spotless record as debtors.

&#x200B;

This principle at work - that you need not default for a 

long time if you solemnly promise to pay nothing for a long time 

\- has not been lost on promoters and investment bankers seeking 

to finance ever-shakier deals. But its acceptance by lenders took 

a while: When the leveraged buy-out craze began some years back, 

purchasers could borrow only on a reasonably sound basis, in 

which conservatively-estimated free cash flow - that is, 

operating earnings plus depreciation and amortization less 

normalized capital expenditures - was adequate to cover both 

interest and modest reductions in debt.

&#x200B;

Later, as the adrenalin of deal-makers surged, businesses 

began to be purchased at prices so high that all free cash flow 

necessarily had to be allocated to the payment of interest. That 

left nothing for the paydown of debt. In effect, a Scarlett 

O'Hara ""I'll think about it tomorrow"" position in respect to 

principal payments was taken by borrowers and accepted by a new 

breed of lender, the buyer of original-issue junk bonds. Debt now 

became something to be refinanced rather than repaid. The change 

brings to mind a New Yorker cartoon in which the grateful 

borrower rises to shake the hand of the bank's lending officer 

and gushes: ""I don't know how I'll ever repay you.""

&#x200B;

Soon borrowers found even the new, lax standards intolerably 

binding. To induce lenders to finance even sillier transactions, 

they introduced an abomination, EBDIT - Earnings Before 

Depreciation, Interest and Taxes - as the test of a company's 

ability to pay interest. Using this sawed-off yardstick, the 

borrower ignored depreciation as an expense on the theory that it 

did not require a current cash outlay. 

&#x200B;

Such an attitude is clearly delusional. At 95% of American 

businesses, capital expenditures that over time roughly 

approximate depreciation are a necessity and are every bit as 

real an expense as labor or utility costs. Even a high school 

dropout knows that to finance a car he must have income that 

covers not only interest and operating expenses, but also 

realistically-calculated depreciation. He would be laughed out of 

the bank if he started talking about EBDIT. 

&#x200B;

Capital outlays at a business can be skipped, of course, in 

any given month, just as a human can skip a day or even a week of 

eating. But if the skipping becomes routine and is not made up, 

the body weakens and eventually dies. Furthermore, a start-and-

stop feeding policy will over time produce a less healthy 

organism, human or corporate, than that produced by a steady 

diet. As businessmen, Charlie and I relish having competitors who 

are unable to fund capital expenditures.

...

 The blue ribbon for mischief-making should go to the zero-

coupon issuer unable to make its interest payments on a current 

basis. Our advice: Whenever an investment banker starts talking 

about EBDIT - or whenever someone creates a capital structure 

that does not allow all interest, both payable and accrued, to be 

comfortably met out of current cash flow net of ample capital 

expenditures - zip up your wallet. Turn the tables by suggesting 

that the promoter and his high-priced entourage accept zero-

coupon fees, deferring their take until the zero-coupon bonds 

have been paid in full. See then how much enthusiasm for the deal 

endures.""

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm naive and just don't understand the role of EBITDA based measures when it comes to analyzing cash flow. He gives his conservatively-stated FCF formula, he never said he didn't account for cash flow, but he didn't (at least back then) concern himself with new measures that allow you to get away with so much accounting and financial mess. If his point stands to scrutiny and those sorts of features erase depreciation and amortization as measures to account for when investing in a business, then why are EBITDA based measures so prominent?

t3_a4t636,Looking for Feedback on a thesis - Short AOS AO Smith,"The pitch is pretty undeveloped - most of the work has been trying to figure out if all of the legs of the thesis work in general so far. If I get encouraging feedback on this front, I'll work on formalizing the pitch and bringing exact measurements into the picture, especially around the valuation part.

&#x200B;

Thesis: Short AO Smith, degree of bearishness is contingent on Chinese view. Valuation on LTM EV/EBITDA is 12.5x is egregious compared with similar home product manufacturers in light of US difficulties and Chinese risks. The company has previously performed like a growth stock and has traded like one, but the company should trade at 7-9x EBITDA similar to comps like Generac.

&#x200B;

Key issues: Larger china exposure than the market is expecting. Market has extrapolated recent explosion in US commercial revenues as secular, but the increase was due to a regulatory change, and should revert to trend line revenues. US Residential revenues should also either stagnate or decline due to lapping replacement cycle from 2005-2007 era. 

&#x200B;

Overview: AO Smith makes water heaters, boilers and water treatment filters. Water heaters make up 90% of revenue. 64% of revenue comes from the US, 34% from China, and 2% from RoW. They’ve built a large Chinese business over the past 2 decades, growing from $50M in revenue in 2003, to $1.05B in FY 2017. The US market is a profitable oligopoly with AO Smith at roughly 50% mkt share, the rest split between 3 other players, and AO Smith has 27% market share in China in a highly competitive market.

&#x200B;

Key Thesis Points:

1.	China exposure

AO Smith has grown their Chinese revenue at a 21% CAGR from 2003-present. However, given the structure of the replacement cycle of water heaters, AO Smith’s Chinese revenues are very vulnerable to a Chinese real estate turnaround. 

&#x200B;

Water heater sales are split between newbuild and replacement water heaters. Replacement heaters are sold when an old one breaks down, so this volume is tied in effect to the number of heaters in operation. Newbuild heaters are sold when new buildings need a water heater. Water heaters are replaced on average every 14 years according to AO Smith (interestingly enough, because of improvements in technology, heaters are now lasting longer, decreasing AO Smith’s available revenue). 

&#x200B;

AO Smith’s Chinese business grew from $50M in 2003 to \~$1B TTM and I think that most of this growth is tied to newbuild residential construction growth in China. Given that AO Smith had \~7.5% Chinese mkt. share in 2003, and their revenues were $50M, overall China-wide revenues from water heaters was \~$650M. In 2017, AO Smith had 27% mkt. share and $1.05B in revenues, for \~$4B in total Chinese revenues. Given the fact that replacement volumes are driven solely by water heaters in operation, I believe that maximum water heater revenues are roughly $650M, at most say $1B.

&#x200B;

The rest of that $4B, $3B+ is extremely vulnerable to a slowdown in construction. In the US from 2007-2009, in a much less bubbly housing market, newbuild sales fell 66% (house price/income ratios of 3-4x, not the 10-30x of China). I think that in a Chinese real estate slowdown that newbuild sales would fall more than that 66% number. In addition, AO Smith owns the high end portion of this market, so I believe their sales are more vulnerable.

&#x200B;

2.	US growth will disappoint

US water heaters are split roughly evenly between commercial and residential sales. Residential sales are driven by the same replacement cycle, 12-14 years. I believe that both residential and commercial segments are lapping large increases in sales that have set expectations too high and will mean revert

&#x200B;

There are two parts to this point – first, US residential replacement volumes are beginning to lap the high newbuild volumes from 2005-2007. While newbuild revenues are a smaller portion of US revenues, the lap is significant. In 2006, 9.5M units were sold, with roughly 2M of those newbuild. In 2009, 7.9M were sold, with only \~600,000 newbuild units. That decrease should start lapping over the next couple of years, and replacement sales should start decreasing slightly.

&#x200B;

Second, AO Smith is losing market share in their commercial segment, in addition to lapping a 2015 regulation change that heavily boosted sales growth. Because AO Smith doesn’t break out revenues by gas or electric, I assume that they roughly mirror the industry mix of gas vs. electric. Modeling out the respective breakdowns, I find that almost all of AO Smith’s revenue increase since 2014 was due to higher volumes in the commercial electric storage water heaters in the US.  

&#x200B;

Please check the trade industry web site:[http://www.ahrinet.org/statistics](http://www.ahrinet.org/statistics) under monthly shipments and historical data for more charts. Here's the most pertinent one, of commerical water heater volumes :[http://www.ahrinet.org/Resources/Statistics/Historical-Data/Commercial-Storage-Water-Heaters-Historical-Data](http://www.ahrinet.org/Resources/Statistics/Historical-Data/Commercial-Storage-Water-Heaters-Historical-Data)

  

This is clearly unsustainable – with all water heater purchases, there needs to be a reason for the water heater to exist – you need to build a new school that needs one or replace an old gas water heater in an existing school. All this recent increase in revenue did was pull forward sales, but management has made no comment about this. I believe there is no reason for sales to not to dip back into 100,000 units a year territory. If you look at AO Smith’s 2017 10-K MD&A, they even admit that a lot of the recent strength has been due to pre-buys, or pulling revenue forward. Over the next 2-3 years I predict a 25-35% decline in commercial electric revenues over the next year or two, a decline of roughly $200M in revenues. 

&#x200B;

Valuation: I believe AO Smith should be trading at roughly 9x 2020 EBITDA. There are two scenarios – the US part of the thesis will execute regardless, but I have no real ability to predict Chinese macro conditions, and I’m just stating that if China falls into a recession, the consequences for AO Smith will be worse than the market predicts. 

&#x200B;

China: I believe this segment will turn deeply unprofitable and will be lossmaking or EBITDA breakeven, removing the roughly $140M it currently contributes to EBITDA.

&#x200B;

US: I believe the incremental $200M in commercial sales generated roughly $50M in incremental EBITDA.

There will be roughly 33% drop in total EBITDA to $400M, and at 9x EBITDA, AO Smith should be worth around $3.5B for roughly 45% downside.

	

Risks: 

&#x200B;

Price increases - highly unlikely, in my opinion. They already raised prices a lot in 2015, which accounted for most of their OM% from 14% to 21%. I don't believe that they'll try raising prices into a declining market. I've also found info that some of their competitors will be ramping investments in the US.

&#x200B;

China - I think the biggest risk here is that China will keep performing, which is entirely possible. Too many people much smarter than me have more insight on this issue. What I'm saying specifically about AO Smith is that from a long perspective, AO Smith is as levered as you'd expect to Chinese housing stability+growth, but that leverage is magnified on the downside. Caveat Emptor on this part.

&#x200B;

Commercial electric revenues continue ramping - Unlikely. The cracks already started to show 3 months prior, as you can see in July's data at the AHRI site. Volumes are now regularly comping 10-20% down YoY vs. 2017, and this was the source of the company's recent weak guidance.

&#x200B;

Thoughts? Criticisms? I don't know how to feel about the China angle, as I think it's very important and something I think the rest of the market isn't seeing, but the timeline for that is unknown and I could just be wrong that China is risky anyways. The US stuff alone is nice, but I'm worried it's not a big enough factor to contribute to real downside. If you take out the China factor, most of the downside I project is due to multiple compression, which I believe will happen as AO Smith has traded at elevated multiples for a while, but is not something to stake a thesis on.

1. Private Equity  has gone through a fund raising boom, growing their AUM several multiples of what it was when they Came public.  There is over a trillion dollars of dry capital waiting to be deployed as opportunities arise.  The market is valuing the names below their ipo prices despite the fact that they are all much larger companies now than when they came public. 

     One of the biggest criticisms of owning these stocks was the lumpiness of their earnings , there could be wild fluctuations from quarter to quarter. In order to address this issue they have forced more LP's (investors) to tie up capital for longer periods which guarantees them a certain amount of fees per quarter which contribute a stable earnings stream to the parent company. 

3.  Another positive catalyst could be the conversion of most of the sector from a pass through entity with k-1 statements every year and complicated structures which many funds are not allowed to own. In addition to the complexity of this arrangement, being a pass through doesn't entitle them to be a member of any of the large indexes which keeps the shares from being owned by many institutions. 

4.  Dividend yields are juicy with some names yielding Near 10%

5.  These are the opposIte of indexing. If you feel passive investing had its day and active management is going to outperform these guys will do great. They thrive on market turmoil and actually welcome it as it gives them a chance to buy companies in distress and attempt to turn them around. 

6.  Possible change in laws to allow the public access to these funds. Blackstones Schwartzman has stated that there could be a time where the public could have their 401k invested in one of the PE funds.

If you give them a conservative $2 EPS and below average sentiment ~5-10X P/E the stock looks pretty attractive.  What are your opinions on this?  What am I missing?

t3_a8zxex,Video Game Stocks - Bullish or Bearish?,"I've been following this industry for almost a year now and have my own view developed, but wanted to create a discussion thread since these names are fairly topical. Would love to get some back and forth going. 

Names I generally think of in this segment are EA, ATVI, TTWO, GME, NTDOY, etc. 

Kerrisdale Capital has this bullish write-up on EA posted to VIC recently. [https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Electronic\_Arts/2008582929](https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Electronic_Arts/2008582929)

I personally disagree with this thesis because: 

* The alpha test of Battlefield V did not receive good feedback counter to their claim it did. I heard directly from the alpha test community that air combat game play was a disaster, weapons werent balanced, other problems with the netcode, etc. 
* EA claims they delayed BF V because they did not want to compete with COD 4 and RDR2 releases during the same window. But, because of the point above, DICE completely re-hauled the BF V code just two weeks prior to EA's announcement of the delay. Due to this, there was no way they could complete a satisfactory alpha / beta test session and meet the original deadline. 
* Fortnite impact on industry is a larger discussion, but has nothing to do with ""battle royale"" mode. 
* I disagree that video games are ""annuity like"" just because a new version comes out every year. Maybe MMOs since you purchase a subscription in some cases, but the examples he uses are definitely not annuities.
* No commentary on increased micro-transaction regulation risk or what % of EA's earnings come from that (its a lot). Surprising because EA's SW BF II micro-transaction debacle was huge news at the time.
* Digital purchases having higher margins and growing as a % of revenue share isn't a new thesis point.  
* Actually, the digital purchase gross margin benefit is likely over-earning at the moment because up-front sticker pricing will probably need to decline in order to get consumers to purchase games when the back-end, digital / DLC content component is beginning to out weight the content available in the original game build. 
* I don't really think the valuation is that compelling unless it was low enough to where you were getting the micro-transaction component of FCF for ""free"".

t3_aaovno,Questions on Debt and Capitalization,"How do investors think about a company's capitalization structure? Obviously they look at it on a stand alone basis and on a relative basis to peers but what exactly can you extract from cap structure information? What are some of the questions investors ask when looking at cap structure?

Suppose I'm looking at WEX Inc. (NYSE:WEX). The Company has a LTM Debt/EBITDA ratio of ~4.4x, compared to Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) at ~4.3x, and First Data at 5.9x. 

From a capitalization perspective, do investors think along the lines of ""WEX and Global Payments can lever up closer to 6.0x and use those proceeds to invest in growth opportunities (organic or inorganic)"" or do they think ""First Data is a much riskier investment due to significant higher leverage compared to WEX and Global Payments""?

Also, how do investors think about debt maturities and best capital structures for businesses? Is the ability to refinance existing debt when it matures all they care about or is there more?",7,0.9,1546116697,"[['WEX', 2]]",WEX,137.77999877929688,146.61000061035156

t3_ac7w3h,Magnora Investment Case - Thoughts Appreciated,"Hi all,

I have been posting on and off on this sub and I wanted to post an investment idea I've been playing around lately. Would really appreciate any feedback. Let me know your thoughts !

Sovereign

========

&#x200B;

Magnora (MGN NO) is a legacy company based in Norway. It has no direct operations, following a divestment of its core business in 2017 and a return of capital (8.5 NOK per share) earlier this quarter. However, Magnora earns licensing revenues from two agreements: the Western Isles Agreement (where the underlying asset is operated in the UK North Sea) and the Penguins Agreement (where the underlying asset is being built in APAC). Magnora has a market cap of 342m NOK or 40m$, and 81.6m NOK in cash pro-forma for the return of capital.

&#x200B;

A. Western Isles Agreement

The Western Isles development consists of production and water injection wells tied back to a new build FPSO with oil export using shuttle tankers. The Western Isles Agreement gives Magnora the right to $0.5/boe produced and offloaded from the Western Isles FPSO during the lifetime of the FPSO (estimated to be 15 years, however Magnora has guided for a potential life of 20-25 years).

The FPSO is owned and operated by Dana Petroleum, which used to be listed but is now fully owned by Korea’s National Oil Corporation (“KNOC”). The Western Isles Agreement is KNOC’s largest project. First oil was achieved in Q4 2017, and the project has a daily production capacity of 44,000 boe.

Magnora does not have any operations but essentially just earns licensing revenues. The revenue from the Western Isles Agreement so far has been 6.8m NOK in Q1, 15.2 in Q3 and 13.8 in Q3. I estimate the run-rate revenue to be \~54m NOK per year (assuming 85% capacity on the 44k boe/d (vs 97% implied in Q2 and 88% in Q3 from the revenue numbers) and a 7.9 USD to NOK hedged exchange rate). At a 10% discount rate the 15 years revenue stream is worth NOK 7.8 per share.

&#x200B;

B. Penguins Agreement

The outstanding milestone payments for the Penguins Agreement are conditional on: completion of the unit (an FPSO), start up and successful production. The party the FPSO is set to be delivered to is a JV between Shell and ExonMobil so I would say there’s not a lot of counterparty risk here. The total nominal value for the total payment is 16m$ over 3 to 5 years. I’m not too sure what value to put on this – after all Magnora is not directly involved and the related parties may just fail to deliver, things could go wrong. Assuming a 50% probability and a payment of the 16m$ only in five years + a 10% discount rate, I find a PV of 43.2m NOK or 0.8 NOK per share. Assuming a 100% probability of success would push this up to 1.6 NOK obviously.

The co said it estimates office costs of 10m NOK which I value at a 10% discount rate, implying a value of NOK -1.9 per share.

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

SOTP, NOK per share

\+ 7.8 -- Western Isles

\+ 0.8 -- Penguins

\+ 1.6 -- PF cash

\- 1.9 -- Head office costs

**= 8.3 -- Equity per share**

Now the full value assuming the Penguins Agreement will be successful is closer to 9 NOK, while if you add an increase in estimated FPSO life to 20 years for the Western Isles FPSO instead of the current 15, you get to NOK 10. For a downside valuation, there’s really not much to say here beyond assuming the Penguins Agreement will never yield anything for Magnora and using a higher discount rate on the Western Isles Agreement of 15%, which would result in a 6.1 valuation per share for Magnora.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I think there is a bit of a value disconnect here, since my valuation gets me to \~30% upside. The implied dividend yield for next year is \~13% based on my 54m NOK revenues and 10m head office cost divided by the most recent share count. Magnora said it would look to return all cash to shareholders unless it found other opportunities. Management also has the possibility to buy back shares, which was granted at a recent EGM. I’m not too afraid of management re-investing in bad ideas. In fact I don’t expect them to reinvest much of the cash unless they find great opportunities. The team seems to have good background and reputations in the North Sea E&P space.

Overall, this is mostly a dividend yield play.

However, I would caveat that

a) this is a fairly illiquid stock, and some banks got stuck on the shareholder register in a reverse offering. As a result Sparebank is the top shareholder with 15%, I’m not sure whether they really intend to be a long term holder of this and they may dump the shares. I note that in the reverse offering (organized to get rid of a large annoying shareholder (Teekay)), almost all holders doubled their holding;

b) there’s no catalyst and no reason for the stock to appreciate beyond future dividend payments, and/or value recognition. There’s of course the small chance that management finds a great opportunity but I wouldn’t count on this.

t3_acyh0t,High margin cloud business soon a commodity? [Discussion],"In a recent interview Stan Druckenmiller stated that he's betting big on cloud companies like Salesforce, Workday and Service Now. He likens the current cloud expansion with the growth of mobile in the last decade.

&#x200B;

Currently Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are the leaders in this business. Meanwhile many other competitors like Oracle, Salesforce, Workday and ServiceNow are all battling for market share.

&#x200B;

With all these players (and more) will the margins inevitably come down over time? Do any of the above mentioned companies have any moats as cloud providers?

&#x200B;

I was thinking about it when I was taking a closer look at Microsoft. Their cloud business currently makes up a significant part of their revenue growth and delivers high margins. While I can see how their software business (Microsoft OS and Office Software) can sustain high ROIC over time, due to high market share, network effects and high switching cost for enterprises, I don't see how the cloud business will be able to sustain the high margins in view of all the competitors in the field.

Here's an article about their new capital raise: https://seekingalpha.com/news/3421399-annaly-capital-slips-capital-raise

This has been going on for a few years - you can see they did the same thing 4 other times since 2017 for a total of $3.5B raised. Look at their annual report here on page 12: https://www.annaly.com/~/media/Files/A/Annaly-V2/Annual%20Reports/2017%20Annual%20Report.pdf

Simultaneously, amidst these stock sales, they've been paying dividends of 10-13% the market cap, higher than almost any other company in the U.S. They don't lower the dividends. These dividends, which total about $1.5B per year, coincidentally add up to slightly less than the total amount raised over the same duration.

What I'm seeing is money coming in from new investors, and money being paid to old investors, simultaneously, while at the same time both of these values being *significant* portions of the company's total value. If you need money for your company, don't you stop paying your ""profits"" as one of the first steps? Unless you've become a ponzi scheme?

t3_aggc60,Free Cash Flow vs. Payout Ratio,"I’m curious to know if anyone has any idea of what the historical tendency is w/r/t the evolution of valuation multiples for stocks that had consistently generated, or had sustainably raised as a result of operations, measures of Free Cash Flow to Shareholder Distributions. 


A bit a long, but this is how I would clarify:

For example, suppose a firm operates in what might not be considered a “high” growth industry, but due to its niche the operations generate a relatively high and sustainable level of FCF, and for whatever reason management is stubborn on raising distributions (e.g., closely held business with controlling shareholders that might not want cash distributions due to personal tax reasons). 

Eventually, something has to give, and since the level of reinvestment needed to sustain FCF becomes a lower and lower portion of FCF, it would (in my mind) make sense to expect an eventual higher payout ratio on FCF, as this is a more effective use of the cash that’s getting hoarded. 

Taking it a step further, suppose the payout ratio IS raised and there isn’t much, if anything sacrificed in the way of both maintenance and growth CapEx. It’s reasonable to expect increased demand from buyers like pensions/income oriented investors, as well as opportunists sniffing a fat PE target to bid up the float without an offsetting flow of sell orders (i.e., the bidding pressure raises the market cap and therefore the multiple). 

So back to the original question - what has been the result on multiples over time for shares with fundamentals that fit this broad description? 

More specifically, what has been the precedent for the magnitude of change in multiples relative to the market? It’d be interesting to know if this dynamic has a similar contribution to total return as the combination of building equity via sustainable FCF and dividends over the life of the investment.

t3_ahby5c,Valuing Online Retail E-Commerce Businesses with Non-Subscription Customers,"Hi All -

First time posting here. I am a long term focused value investor (fine with 5-10+ year positions). I've been diligencing an online e-commerce business for the past year now I find compelling. As I've gotten further into this though I have noticed there really are not too many publicly listed online E-Commerce retailers. I'm wondering if anyone has seen any helpful fund write-ups or analysis to help think through a proper valuation. 

Rather than marketplace E-Commerce businesses such as Amazon or Ebay, I'm more thinking the speciality online retail businesses such as ASOS Plc (AIM:ASC), Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W), AO World plc (LSE:AO.), Zalando SE (XTRA:ZAL), Zooplus AG (DB:ZO1), boohoo group plc (AIM:BOO),  Ocado Group plc (LSE:OCDO), etc.

I know there is no one size fits all but I'm really looking for examples of different ways investors have approached valuation for these types of businesses. I'm not interested in the offline retailer that has an impressive online growth catalyst, but really these pure online retailers. These are often companies growing quickly and maintaining low margins that, assuming they can maintain strong customer economics and reach scale, should be able to demonstrate sizable dollar profitability down the road. Often some of the most interesting are committed to operating at near break even, allocating 100% of the spread between gross profit and non-S&M Opex entirely to marketing to acquire customers and lock expected long term profitable cohorts down the road.

I've seen people just look at TEV/Sales multiples, some attempts at an NPV on the customer base given disclosed customer economics (e.g. - LTV/CAC and retention, etc.), a terminal market share and EBIT margins x mature EBIT multiple, and several other approaches.

 If any of you have seen any interesting analysis or fund letters on these types of businesses I'd greatly appreciate it.

t3_ahidpk,Short Moody's as a hedge against rising rates?,"So Moody's (MCO) peaked at about $70/share before the GFC in 2008. It now trades at $160/share. 

Although rating agencies directly contributed to the systemic risks w/ the housing market and AAA ratings on subprime MBS, they are the one of the biggest beneficiaries of the consequences. The lowering of interest rates to near zero (free) led to an explosion in corporate debt, and guess what? These bonds needed to be rated by MCO and SP. 

>Since 2007, the value of corporate bonds outstanding from nonfinancial companies has nearly tripled – to $11.7 trillion [source](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/overview/in-the-news/are-we-in-a-corporate-debt-bubble). 

MCO's market size grew 300% in about 10 years or about 12%/yr. This growth cannot continue into perpetuity.


It looks like rising rates and declining liquidity are pressuring the debt market. Corporate debt issuances in December 2018 declined 24% YOY [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/reuters-america-update-1-corporate-bond-issuance-shrinks-to-7-year-low-as-selloff-deepens.html). If corporate debt dries up,  could pressure MCO's fwd growth. As rates rise, corporations will likely slow debt issuances and will also stop refinancing their debt - all of which needs to be rated. It appears obvious that rising rates will pressure the debt market, and this will indirectly impact MCO's fee rating business.

My only real concern here is that they also likely have massive amounts of data, something that is not shown on the balance sheet. Financial data could be very valuable in the near term with ML and AI. ",14,0.86,1547868541,"[['MCO', 1]]",MCO,158.11000061035156,157.0399932861328

Notes:

Q: How do you make capital allocation decisions?

A: The base dividend is set at .20 per year. The board considers a supplemental divided in Q4, depending on how the business performs.

\- This year, TECK asked shareholders how they wanted capital returned.  Shareholders overwhelmingly requested buybacks.

\- Shareholders wanted buybacks over dividends.

\- On close of the QB2 investment, the board will consider more dividends or buybacks, balanced against business needs.

\- Management believes that the current share price represents a good value, so buybacks make sense in this case.  They pointed out that TECK trades at a low EBITDA multiple and a low multiple of analysts estimates of NAV.

\- Most of TECK's capital allocation for growth over the next few years is going to copper via QB2 and possibly QB3.

\- Management considers buying external assets, but in recent times haven't seen anything that meets their quality standards at a price that they can justify paying.

\- QB2 is in the works, we know.  But QB3 has the potential to share a lot of infra with QB2, making QB3 incredibly capital efficient.  QB3 decisions could come in the late 2020's.

\- Moody's upgraded TECK to investment grade last week.

\- The two other ratings agencies are waiting for the QB2 deal to close before making any ratings adjustments.  Expect more upgrades.

\- Investment grade ratings from 2 of the 3 agencies will save the company more than 50 million per year.

\- Teck is very positive about copper over the medium to long term.

\- Teck has considered expanding into battery metals to take advantage of the electric vehicle boom. Nickel may hold some interest.",3,0.81,1548450357,"[['TECK', 3]]",TECK,22.399999618530273,24.020000457763672
t3_alhi76,"Breaking down Alibaba's 2019 Q3 - Observations, Questions, and Estimates","BABA declared \~42% revenue growth and $1.84 GAAP EPS today and the markets responded positively. 

&#x200B;

Looks good on the surface, but my quick review shows some really interesting points:

1. Of total revenue growth (34B RMB) YoY, the main source of revenue growth in the core commerce, Tmall and Taobao and related advertising fees, grew \~27% or 14B RMB. Other growth Alibaba included was mainly owing to the new supermarket chain Freshippo, new sales from the search engine/retailer Kubei. In the same period, fixed costs went up 33B RMB (26B from cost of revenue). Gross margin dropped from 58% to 48% owing to slim supermarket margins and 11/11 discounts aimed at spurring more purchases to continue growing that day's sales. Meanwhile, you have little to no organic growth in international (apart from companies they bought) and money-burning initiatives in direct sales and what they call ""new retail"" that continue to increase losses while growth is fairly slow. 
2. I'm confused on how when revenue for sales goes up 27%, Cainiao delivery revenue went up only 15%? wouldn't it be a 1 for 1?
3. Operating income remained **unchanged** between 2017 and 2018. In 2017, Alibaba revalued Cainiao to generate 23B RMB in investment income. In the same period, they wrote down the amount they previously revalued for Alibaba Pictures (18B RMB in 2015 and wrote down 18B in 2017... suspicious), which offset this somewhat. In 2018 December, Alibaba revalued Kubei to generate 10B RMB in investment income. This grants them the ability to continue showing a net income YoY growth number, when it was actually flat.
4. Alibaba continues to bloat to its balance sheet from investing in subsidiaries, goodwill, and borrowing. There are no equivalents in large US tech companies where goodwill and subsidiary ""value"" account for more than 50% of assets. 
5. Net income was 33B RMB and Amortization was 3B, but cash from operations was \~65B RMB. Where did the other 29B RMB come from? 
6. Related to this point, FCF was 25B RMB, but for their 25B increase in short-term assets they also have an additional 40B in short-term liabilities. **They also spent 31B in investment while marking up their investments by about 60B in the same period.** So cash should have decreased, not increased here.

My eyes hurt from trying to adjust everything by the right amounts, but what it seems to me is that Alibaba revenue is actually slowing considerably for its main companies (maybe 15-20% growth fueled by lowering prices and deteriorating margins), offset by buying companies and continuing to revalue them. At some point it will mark down these big investments, but as long as there's another company to devour and revalue by 2-3x just by virtue of being bought by Alibaba then they can mask these deteriorating margins. 

&#x200B;

The cycle continues and their ""assets"" and liabilities grow. Strip away these ""revaluations"" and you get a messy conglomerate trading at almost 60x earnings with halted revenue growth in its core businesses and widening losses in others, without profitability in sight. The one bright spot is the cloud, but it's not a significant source of revenue yet. Offsetting that, Alibaba is hit by the China slowdown, hard, and this trend should continue. 

&#x200B;

2. Using Equity Growth as a proxy for EPS Growth. This one I am still scratching my head. Could someone point me to a resource or provide a quick explanation why Equity Growth will be in many case a good proxy for EPS Growth? especially when the company wouldn't do any buybacks?

t3_ao6b2a,Valuing an Oil and Gas Company,"Hi all, 

&#x200B;

Wanted to ask some help in trying to value an Oil and Gas Company. 

I'm trying to value a small oil and gas E&P in Australia. I'm trying to do a Net Asset Valuation and have looked up the average Oil price and average gas price and used production to deplete the reserves year by year to get the revenues. 

I tried to use the cost of sales from the annual report as the cost of production. And used a decline rate of 5% for gas and 10% for oil, though it's shale and I'm not sure if that's too low. 

I have tried to minus the capital expenditure while adding back the depreciation and amortization. As would be done for a normal company. Hope that's correct? 

After using a discount rate of 10% to get the cash flows, I've managed to get a valuation. 

I had a few questions, I wanted to ask

&#x200B;

1. Are those decline rates okays? Are there any good sources to find decline rates? 
2. Is the method I used above to get the Free Cash Flows to discount by okays? The oil and gas accounting is a bit different so I've been trying to figure it out. 
3. The valuation I did based on 1P is very low and on 2P it's also a fraction of the market price. I am guessing this may be because the company has added reserves every year for the past few years and the market may also be pricing in higher future oil and gas prices. Is NAV usually a good valuation tool? Using relative valuations (P/E multiples, P/Reserves multiples don't seem to make as much sense for a value investor). 
4. Would it make more sense to try to factor in the number of reserves they'll keep adding in the next few years? 
5. I googled and found that some companies supposedly list PV10 estimates? but when I looked up a few annual reports, I couldn't find any of these? 
6. I had to make rough estimates of the cost of producing oil vs producing gas, let along selling them. Any guidance on this would be great

Sorry for the long list of questions, but any info would really help! 

Please do guide me to any resources, books or otherwise

&#x200B;

Thanks!

t3_aqcsqa,"Newbie questions to recent drop in CSS industries (is this a ""value play""?)","First some short infos to me:


I just started looking into investing, i´m not a native english speaker and not used to reddit formatting, so please excuse any ""dumb"" questions, spelling or grammar mistakes and eventuall walls of text.


So i have been reading the first 2 books of Phil Town and pretty much liked the style of investing because i can follow where he is going and the reasoning for valuating stocks. I also researched to some degree what Warren Buffet and Benjamin Graham taught and have just finished reading ""The Dhandho Investor"". Some info in the Dhandho Investor correlated to the style of Benjamin Graham and early Warren Buffet. Buying bussines under the book value.


Wich brings me to CSS industries, a company producing and selling crafts and gifts (ribbons, stationery,...) wich faced a loss of 25% on Friday (8 feb.) after the earnings statement. I than started to research a little bit more and noticed that CSS had come down a whopping 75% in the last 2 years sitting at 6,88$ a share compared to 24.24$ book value per share giving it a P/B of 0.28 (i did not specfically search for low P/B ratios). There are around 8.8mio shares and around 75% is owned by institutions. Insiders have been buying lately (not massivly but there where no sales recently)


So i wondered if that massive drop and misprice ratio was justified and here is what i found (please correct me if i got something wrong):

The company took a big net loss getting a EPS of -7,57. They also have some debt at medium high levels. Both comes from 

1: acquisition of 2 companys (simplicity and Mccall)

2: Some heavy non-cash tax costs (actually i did not fully understand whats the meaning of this but that it should not repeat this heavily in the next year)

3: Moving parts of production from China to the US

I think this alone dropped the stock quite alot.


Next negative i found was that their sales in Brick and Mortar stores is going down on most products and they lost some major retailers selling the products. On the contrary Simplicity did good sales. On the earnings call they said that sales will probalby continue to drop year over year but they are looking on selling more online and have a consumer subsription service and a online sales app in the pipeline for 2020.

The stock is paying 0,8$ dividend wich is 11.6% on the stock price of Friday.


There is also some more mixed in because of the seasonal character of the bussines wich i think made the drop even stonger.


The EPS in the recent history was around 1.5-2$ and the market was willing to pay an average P/E of 14. The P/E dropped last year to 7,5. The analyst forward EPS is 0.96 and the EPS 2011 after negative EPS 2010 (-2.45) was 0.58.
The P/B ratio the last few years was around 1


So my conclusion:
This is not a ""wonderfull bussines"" i want to own for 10 years but it might be ""a cigar butt with 1 smoke left inside"". CSS will probably become profitable again somewhere end of this year or start of next year. 

I think the P/B will not come back fully to 1 but maybe around 0.7ish because the sales are declining.

I also don´t see a P/E of 14 anymore but rather somewhere around 10. With the forward EPS that would justify a stock price of 9.6$ if looking at P/E and around 17$ looking at P/B.


So my final thought is a goal of around 10$ per share by end of this year with a possible higher price somewhere mid 2020.


I don´t see a reason for the price to drop another 50% or so to somewhere 4$ ish but i see the danger of an general economic downturn dragging CSS further down. 


So, what did i miss? Does anybody see a trap? Am i too positive in the outlook? What other numbers should i look at for valuition (i looked at FCF and the other numbers but im still juggeling with to many numbers)

t3_asw93r,Berry Global Corp $BERY Thesis,"**Background:**

Berry Global Corporation ($BERY) is a global company that sells plastic and rigid containers through their three components, Engineered, Health, Hygiene & Specialties, and Consumer Packaging. Blue chip costumers include Starbucks, McDonalds, Home Depot, and Walmart. In the past 10 years, they have expanded their corporation through the acquisitions of 19 companies, and 44 in the past 30 years.

**Thesis:**

Berry ($BERY) should return upwards of 30% given that:

1) Acquisition strategy has been strong

· Maintained high Net Income despite carrying more debt than their comparable companies

2) Shown consistent growth in current operations

· They have hovered around 3% organic growth

**Fundamentals:**

· $6.90bln MC; $12,304 EV, 24.8 EV/E

· $601m FCF in 2017, $630m FCF 2018, EST $670 FCF 2019

· $2.51 EPS in 2017, $3.71 EPS in 2018, 

· COGS makes up 82% of revenue, SG&A makes up 6%

· Gross margins of 18%

**Model**

· Maturity -3%

· Discount 5.5%

**Competition:**

· Sonoco Products ($SON) - $6.11bln MC, $7.17 EV, 40.9 EV/E

· Bemis ($BMS)- $4.82bln MC, $6.09 EV, 53.0 EV/E

**Risks**

· Having too much debt if they decide to bid for RPC and get accepted.

· Currency fluctuation as the company continues to expand internationally

· Consumer Packaging segment operating income went down 13%, EBITDA went down 7% from Q1 2018.  

· Wall Street predicts $0.97 EPS for Q2, I model it at roughly $0.85-0.94. Might be better to wait until after Q2 to get a better price.

· Continuously beats their own expectations, and highlight that in their investor relations packet. Always makes me question how honest the management is (under promising and over delivering). Small problem, not major as I realize many firms do this.

  

**RPC Merger**

· This is not built into my model, but I think that if it occurs, would be good for the company.

· £3.2bln MC, £4.4bln EV, 17.3 EV/E 

· Current bid is £3.3, not sure what it would have to be to get accepted.

t3_atasjr,Deep Value (High Yielders) vs. Revenue/FCF Growers,"Hey there,

I was wondering what your thoughts on Deep Value (typical high yielders like a lot of brick-and-mortar retailers) prospects during loftier periods of valuation are like versus companies growing sales/fcf at fast rates (>20% CAGR).

&#x200B;

After playing around with a few screeners for a while over various time periods, I'm getting that firms with high revenue yields on enterprise value / high free cash flow yield on enterprise value are performing very well in 2008-2012, whereas the prospects have sort of tapered off as index-buying has pushed up the market in general. For example, i'm only finding low-margin retailers and small oil/gas refiners as ""high-yield"" prospects right now - but we've all seen margins flip.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, it seems like companies that grow fcf or revenues quickly (usually the software / tech firms with no dividend and high ROIC ) sort of outpace the index buying and remain solid long opportunities into late-stage markets.

So beta is basically how the market reacts to news about a company.

t3_b1himc,Issues with YELP (Cut and Pasted from AIDVP site),"# Case Study: Do you really know what is going on at YELP?

&#x200B;

Leave marks where bodies are buried. That is exactly my feeling after I read YELP 10-K MD&A cliff notes. Let me explain.

**Troubling Text 1: (Pg 57 in 2018 10-K)**

>**Specifically, we agreed to indemnify GrubHub and certain related parties against certain losses arising out of Grubhub’s purchase of Eat24, including, but not limited to, any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by us or Eat24 in the purchase agreement. While Grubhub’s right to recover for many claims is limited to the funds being held in escrow, certain claims are capped only at the total purchase price. The date and amount of final release of escrow funds are subject to the resolution of any such claims. The escrow balance is presented on our consolidated balance sheets as another non-current asset.**

The issue here is not the escrow account, which is only 10% of the total price, but the highlighted line. That purchase price is $287.5 million. Why the hell would they tell us this now? Especially, why would they put it under liquidity and capital resources? A point that would keep me up if I am invested in Yelp.

**Troubling Text 2:**

**From 2018 10-K -**

>**In 2018, we recognized an income tax benefit of $15.3 million primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance previously recorded against certain deferred tax assets, offset by foreign income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased $46.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the gain on the disposal of Eat24 in 2017, offset by the release of valuation allowance in 2018. Income tax expense increased $30.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016primarily due to the gain on disposal of Eat24 recorded in 2017**

**From 2017 10-K -**

>**It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months there may be sufficient positive evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance. A release of this valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.**

**Why is this troubling?**

Because it is a great way to temporarily pump up net income. Note that valuation allowance is something management can have great control over. It is what an accountant call ""best judgment"". Right... It is like deferred revenue when management can't make the revenue number, they ask their accountant - ""how much deferred do I still have?"". The fact that no mentioning of what -""sufficient positive evidence"" leading to releasing a significant portion of the valuation allowance - makes me think ""really? Given people complaining about bad customer experience, fake reviews, low morale. "" Most importantly, they have done similar things for 3 years in a row - 2016, 2017, and 2018. Why would a growing business do that?

**Troubling Text 3 -**

From 2018 10-K

>**We expect provision for doubtful accounts to increase as advertising revenue generated from newer customers continues to become a larger percentage of our overall advertising revenue.**

These were added in 2018 10-K (page 54). Just for the record, it is a whopping 20% increase from 2017. If the number wasn't the biggest issue, then the underlying message is. As we all know, YELP has recently changed its contractual process with new customers. No more long term contracts. If no more long term contracts, why would existing clients not make up the bulk of the advertising revenue as Yelp has been around for years? Why would doubtful accounts increase so much when no long term contracts are required?

# Since Sep 2018, more than $25 million worth of stocks were sold by ALRM executives and we continue to see them selling. What do they know that we don't? Let's take a look into ALRM's recent 10-K filing and look at MD&A cliff notes section, compiled by our AI. The quoted lines are the direct extracts from their 10-K.

**The ""tell good"" cash figure**

&#x200B;

On paper, ALRM shows 60.71M in CFO. However, The $3.5 million increase in cash from operating was primarily due to the $28.0 million expense recorded during 2018 but not yet paid as of December 31, 2018. If it was paid, CFO would have decreased YOY. EBITDA would be negative.

Do you know that the working capital figure reported in 10-K exclude deferred revenue, even though that they should have at least included the current years deferred since it is a current liability?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Our software license revenue growth 30% but...**

>**Additionally, the increase in the software license revenue was due to the timing of the acquisition of certain assets and** **assumed certain liabilities** **of the Connect line of business and** **all of the outstanding equity interests** **of the two subsidiaries through which Icontrol conducted its Piper line of business in June 2016 or the Acquisition.**

But I (ALRM mangement) made some assumptions on liabilities and all of the outstanding equity interests of the two subsidiaries...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Our contacts with customers (Adoption of topic 606)**

>**The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition policies, however, as a result of adopting the new standard, we changed our treatment of commissions paid to employees, which we** **previously expensed as incurred.**

&#x200B;

Let me speak in another manner - We still pay our staff the same way. It just in order to not affect our revenue figure, we capitalize their commissions and amortize its costs over a period of three years to not affect our bottom line that analysts look at...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The disconnect between Debt and Equity**

>**""On November 30, 2018, we amended the 2017 Facility to incorporate the parameters that** **must be met** **for us to repurchase our outstanding common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on November 29, 2018.""**

If you are a momentum trader, ALRM looks great. Up 50% and show strong support at 40. If you are a fundamental number guy, you love it. It has solid quality numbers - FCF/S at 12%, CROIC TTM at 14.4%. Five years annualize growth rate at 26.4% and GPA at 0.62. Looking great. However, why would the lenders restrain them from purchasing equity if the company that is so promising? because everyone else does it... But, cov lite is every where and terms are so loose these days. Maybe, they are not that promising. By the way, look at the date. Board prove the buy back on 29 and immediately, one day later, debt holder ask them to add the new parameter to restrict them from repurchasing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**We can lose it all if we default**

>**The 2017 Facility contains various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our capacity to incur other indebtedness, liens, make certain payments including dividends, and enter into other transactions without the approval of the lenders. The 2017 Facility is** **secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property.** 

The last part of the disclosure is very scary - The 2017 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. Why would any firm bet with everything if not desperate?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ongoing Intellectual Property Litigation**

>**The $40.4 million increase in general and administrative expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was due in part to a $39.9 million increase in legal expenses primarily resulting from a $28.0 million expense for the agreement reached to settle the legal matter alleging violations of the TCPA by one of our service providers as well as this service provider’s sub-dealer agents within our Alarm.com segment.**

Litigation expense has increased 3 fold since 2016. In the most recent 10-K filing, there are 92 mentioning of litigation. Most importantly, its litigation expense is now 2 fold of net income for 2018. **Do you know that ALRM's executives are paid based on adjusted EBITDA, which exclude litigation costs?**

&#x200B;

**Executive Compensation**

ALRM uses Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under their executive bonus plan. Their Adjusted Ebitda excludes acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses. In 2018 Alarm faced a G&A increase of $39.9 million in legal expenses, which likely to continue with other lawsuits. Their non-adjusted EBITDA is 34.93. Because of their exclusion of legal expense (which is ""normal"" if not getting sued), their adjusted EBITDA is 93.1M for 2018. However, their NOPAT is around 14M if not account the tax benefit which is not even half of what it was in 2017 (NOPAT around 34M)

t3_b568zo,Why is Levered FCF / EV a flawed multiple?," 

Hey guys, just wanted to post a bit of discussion on  FCFF (Free cash to the firm) and its impacts on EV/FCF, FCF yield on EV, Free Cash ROA. I’m not in line with traditional finance methodology so I might be entirely wrong.

In terms of measuring profitability to shareholders, I believe Levered FCF / EV is the superior metric. FCF / Price is flawed in that impacts from payments of principal on net debt are excluded from the calculation. Although these do technically “clean” or de-leverage the book of a company, payments to principal on net debt just decrease interest and increase book value– but this does not increase future FCF (other than the interest impacts) since no assets are added. For example, a company with 100 B in debt and 1 B in equity might be mainly oriented towards creditors, and free cash flow might not be in shareholders eyes for a long time since the company might be stuck dealing with paying creditors principal or even just paying preferred share dividends. Even if “mandatory debt repayments” may be factored into FCF as short-term impacts, they are not provided over a period and so might temporarily depress FCF in a short period when the company has to pay back its debt. These sorts of firms have insane FCF / Price ratios since only interest payments are factored into FCF, but the impacts from net debt are ignored entirely (like Windstream holdings, and other extremely levered firms). I do understand that “cleaning” the book can result in allowing for additional debt offerings which can provide a company with fresh cash, but this is mitigated with the risks present in taking on debt (covenants). On the other hand, FCF / EV factors in the impact of debt principal in the denominator, since EV can represent impacts from preferred shares, debt (which can be refinanced), or other impacts like minority stakes.  If a company has a large amount of debt financing, then payments to principal on net debt might suck up a lot of FCF. These might not be represented sufficiently by a FCF / Price multiple as debt due in, say, 3 years won't show up in the current multiple. Nevertheless, FCF / Price is great for unlevered firms / firms without minority stakes or preferred shares. 

Also, UFCF / EV doesn’t factor in interest payments, only the impacts from debt principal in the denominator. This results in important miscalculations, since whether a firm pays 3% or 27% interest on its debt makes zero impact whatsoever to UFCF / EV. This means that its role as profitability of an entire business is entirely flawed. You cannot just factor out interest and use debt in the denominator – this results in excluding extremely valuable information on what interest rate is paid. Therefore, this metric seems flawed for its purpose. For example, Kohl's showed up on my screener - although they have to pay 16.6% of fcf annually just to pay interest. This excludes the impact of the principal they will also have to pay.

 Another way to think about why FCFF / EV might be misleading is a firm that takes out 100 B (exaggerated figure for clarity) in loans and receives 100 B in cash. EV will consider the new debt and cash to effectively nullify each other, and FCFF will ignore the interest payments. Therefore, the FCFF / EV would be the same, but interest would squander all of real free cash flow available for equity holders. Interest could even be so great that the firm might go insolvent. Therefore, FCFF / EV would represent the entire firm.. but would be a relatively useless metric for any shareholders. 

I understand this is not in line with conventional finance teachings, but I have no inclination as to what is wrong about using these updated metrics. The same logic applies for UFCF/EV as EBIT/EV.. EBIT does not reflect interest payments at all and EV just reflects the net debt principal.",7,0.74,1553488761,"[['FCF', 11], ['B', 4]]",FCF,12.199999809265137,12.930000305175781
t3_b6544g,"SMTA, speculation play on small-cap REIT","**Preface:** I am not long or short SMTA I am awaiting more analysis, I want to hash through potential holes in my thesis. Criticism and scrutiny welcome and encouraged.

**The** **business**: 

SMTA (SPIRIT MTA REIT) is  an externally managed REIT formed in Maryland that invests in and manages a portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the U.S. that is generally leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to tenants operating within retail, office, and industrial property types. 

Spirit MTA was spun off from Spirit Realty Capital for risk mitigation purposes for latter's real estate portfolio.

**Basic Info:**

Price: $6.87 as of previous close (3/26/19)

Market Cap: $295M

Current Yield: 19.4%

Beta: 0.59 (Nasdaq)

**Dividend** **history**: 

Q3 18: $0.33

Q4 18: 1.33

Q1 19: 0.33

**Analysis:**

*The bad:*

SMTA has been absolutely hammered over the last six months, trading just below $12 in November to under $7 currently.  Red flags for investors include SMTA carrying a negative book value of equity due to accumulating a deficit, despite slight increases in the debt structure in the company. The Company issued $150M in preferred equity in 2018. There is a legitimate concern that the company may go into liquidation. They have already written off a sizable portion of their debt.

This is key:  As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was an allowance for loan losses on loans receivable of $35.1 million. $33.8 million of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2018 relate to an allowance on the B-1 Term Loan due from Shopko as a result of Shopko's bankruptcy. I am under the impression that this Shopko loss will be a one-off, but it is not the end of the road. From 2019-2023, Shopko owes SMTA $209M of $1,072M of operating leases (19.5% of  total op leases over that period). SMTA has sold off a small amount of their owned properties portfolio, which has contributed to less revenue. Revenue over the past few hears has been stable, but not showing any signs of growth.  

&#x200B;

*The good:*

SMTA paid a special dividens of $1 on top of their regular dividend of $0.33 in Q4. Let's adjust this to assume a $0.33 dividend for for quarters for a $1.32 annual dividend. If the stock stays in the $7 range, this will yield 18.8%.

Even when being conservative and assuming no special dividends, and no growth. And lets assume also assume since this company is not a going concern, so lets make the cost of capital higher than what they are currently raising.

They issued Prefered shares paying 10% dividends, they have raised debt at effective rates of just below 6% interest. 

&#x200B;

**Assumptions**:

WACC. Using Duff and Phelps CAPM plus High Financial Risk Size Premium here. I would like some feedback on this part, if nothing else.

Rf = 3.5% normalized Rf rate

Beta= 0.54 SIC 6798 Median Beta

ERP= 5.5%

HFR Size Premium= 16.37%

Total KoE= 22.8%

 Cost of raising further Preferred shares or debt will be more than in previous capital raises. I think using a weighted average of the cost of debt and preferred shares would inappropriately bring down the WACC. 

Reminder that the Dividend Growth Model is P0= D1/(r-g)

Case 1:

Let's assume no growth in the dividend over the next year for a divided of $1.32 over our cost of equity of 22.8%. This gives us a price of $5.79, indicating it is overvalued by about 17%.

Case 2: 

Let's assume small growth in the dividend over the next year, continuing with their special dividend giving us $2.32 annualized, but no further growth in the future with the same cost of equity. This would give us a price of $10.18, indicating about a 40% upside. 

Case 3: 

The company cuts dividends to $1 annualized, and indicates no future growth, with the same cost of equity. This would give us a prive of $4.39, a 37% downside.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

This stock seems to have a lot of question marks, especially with recent capital raises and high financial risk. If you are willing to speculate and are optimistic of the company's performance and a similar year. I am somewhere between all three of these cases, and from the relatively small time I've put into this analysis, I would not be surprised in either direction.

t3_b7u40y,BYND Stock,"Beyond Meat is supposed to IPO this year and as a vegan myself I'm curious if others have also looked into the business. Even if it IPOs at an inflated value, assuming the price stabelizes is anyone interested in also owning this company? Its hard to look into the fundamentals of a private company any tips? 

BYND seems to have a major market share and frankly produces a product which is unrivaled at the consumer level other than impossible foods which only sells to resturantes. They also hold a sizable cash position which they intend to deploy to aquire other brands and from what I've read have low debt. This market share plus their aquisition potential lead me to believe they can be the biggest player in the growing vegan foods industry in the future. They currently run the vegan beef market and their new vegan sausage line is gaining market share fast. With the addition of possibly a vegan dairy line (beyond milk?) Which is currently 11B+ in sales worldwide they can be a juggernaut. With the aquisition or partnership with a company like miyokos creamery (small vegan creamery that makes dairy alternitive which is clearly the best from a quality perspective but lacks in supply chain and resources compared to larger companies like daiay) that would be a dangerous combo to the market.

Edit: also a good amount of people are dogmatically opposed to veganism and the average investor who has these oppositions to veganism might also allow these biases to have a unreasonably negative outlook when deciding to invest in a company like BYND leading to deflated pricing? Is this possible?

t3_b8cxjx,Sportsman Warehouse- SPWH,"**Industry**

The outdoor activities and sporting goods market is highly fragmented and competitive. There are four distinct types of stores; independent locally owned stores often known as “mom and pop”, specialty retailers such as Bass Pro Shops, sporting goods stores such as Dicks Sporting Goods, and mass merchandisers such as Amazon and Walmart.

U.S. outdoor activities and sporting goods retail sales in our related product categories totaled over $70 billion in 2017. The size of the pie is increasing as wildlife recreation has increased across all categories that Sportsman operates in. This increased participation is evidenced by numerous surveys involving recreation participation.

Over the past decade, specialty retailers, such as Sportsman Warehouse, have gained market share of equipment sales at the expense of mass merchants, discount stores and independent retailers, or “mom & pop” shops, which Sportsman believes comprise approximately 65% of the market.

In addition, while there are over 55,000 federal firearms licenses, or FFLs, in the United States today, only 4,000 are currently held by national or regional specialty stores. Since FFLs are issued at the store level, these statistics imply that the remaining 93% of the market is fragmented among mom & pop stores.

This fragmentation the market presents an attractive opportunity for Sportsman to continue to expand its market share, as customers increasingly prefer a broad and appealing selection of merchandise, competitive prices, high levels of service and one-stop shopping convenience.

**Company Profile**

Sportsman Warehouse was founded in 1986 as a single store in Midvale, Utah and has grown to 87 stores in 22 states. The company is the largest outdoor specialty store base in the Western United States and Alaska. The stores range from 15,000 to 65,000 gross square feet, with an average size of approximately 40,000 gross square feet. The company currently has plans to grow to 100 stores. The company sells hunting, shooting, fishing and camping gear.

The company believes it is less capital-intensive for it to open new stores compared to its principal competitors because of its no frills store layout. Stores generally require less square footage than the stores of its competitors and a smaller initial cash investment. In small- to medium-sized markets, Sportsman Warehouse is often able to establish itself as a standalone destination for customers. In larger markets, the company has successfully leveraged existing infrastructure to open stores in shopping plazas near complementary retailers. In 2018, the company expects to grow its square footage by approximately 3% as it shifts some cash toward reducing its debt balance. Over the long term, Sportsman’s target remains to grow its square footage at a rate of greater than 10% annually.

Sportsman effectively serves markets of multiple sizes, from Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or MSAs, with populations of less than 75,000 to major metropolitan areas with populations in excess of 1,000,000. It generates consistent four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales volumes.

Sportsman’s stores typically reach a mature sales growth rate within three to four years after opening, with net sales increasing approximately 25% in the aggregate during this time period. For the 40 stores opened since 2010 that have been open for a full twelve months (excluding our 10 acquired stores), Sportsman achieved an average four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.1% and an average ROIC of 74.1% excluding initial inventory cost (and 27.9% including initial inventory cost) during the first twelve months of operations. In addition, Sportsman’s achieved an average pre-tax payback period of less than one year (excluding initial inventory cost) and expect to achieve an average pre-tax payback period of approximately 2.5 years (including initial inventory cost).

**Moat**

Sportsman holds against the online stores as regulatory restrictions create certain structural barriers to the online sale of approximately 33% of Sportsman’s revenue, such as firearms, ammunition, certain cutlery, propane and reloading powder. As a result, this portion of its business is currently more protected from online only retailers, such as Amazon.

**Management**

Sportsman appointed a new CEO from the role of COO. Prior to joining the company in 2017 Jon Barker was VP Global Officer for Wal-Mart Stores. The current CFO has announced that he is leaving the company and the company is currently searching for a replacement.

**Valuation**

The company earned $.55 per share and trades at $4.8 per share. It trades at roughly 9 times earnings. Due Sportsman’s moat, expanding market share, and less capital-intensive requirements I believe Sportsman is a buy at current prices.

t3_b93al3,Help understanding truck leasing company accounting,"Hi all,

I am currently looking at valuing a truck leasing company, but am having trouble with some of the accounting related to the debt financing of the vehicles. 

The business uses leverage to acquire the truck fleet, part of which is collateralized by the vehicles, part of which is unsecured. However, when thinking about the cash flows generated by the business, I am having trouble understanding how this flows through.

Lets say they earn $3B in EBITDA, and have depreciation expense of $2B (no amortization). The EBIT would be $1B (lets assume no taxes), and therefore NOPAT is $1B. If you add back the $2B in depreciation, you have $3B in gross cash flows. Their CapEx on fixed assets is quite small, lets assume $300M, and the change in working capital (defined as current assets-cash-current liabilities, which does NOT include the additions to vehicles) is $30M. The math for FCF here works out to $3B-$300M-$30M=$2,670M. That seems like an insane number for 1 year's worth of FCF on $3B of EBITDA with a business with huge fleet expenses. However, the fleet expenses are in cash flows from investing, and are classified as non-current assets.

My question is, where in the FCF calculation would you factor in the fleet spending, and how would you forecast the accounting for that (i.e. do you forecast additions to debt to offset that on the balance sheet)? Would i include it as part of CapEx in the FCF calculation?

Thanks in advance.

t3_b91it5,Thoughts on how this applies in low interest rate environments...,"Hi all, I was reading Klarman's intro to Security Analysis and came across this nugget:

>Another standard is to invest when a security offers an acceptably attractive return to a long-term holder, such as a low-risk bond priced to yield 10% or more, or a stock with an 8% to 10% or higher free cash flow yield at a time when “risk-free” U.S. government bonds deliver 4% to 5% nominal and 2% to 3% real returns. Such demanding standards virtually ensure that absolute value will be quite scarce.

This seems to coincide with Graham's mechanical recommendation that stocks should have an earnings yield twice that of AAA bonds (although he specified the yield never be less than 10%).

Anyway, I'm wondering if, in such low interest rate environments, a FCF yield that is twice the risk free rate really offers an  ""acceptably attractive return to a long-term holder"".

In Canada, the risk free rate seems to be 1.96%--using Klarman's logic, would a FCF yield of 3.9% really be an attractive yield (assuming the stock's fundamentals were strong)?

Apologies if this is a silly question--many thanks for your time!

P.S. I'm thinking of using a required yield as a screen, then performing DCFs to reach an estimate of each security's intrinsic value.",14,0.87,1554315260,"[['FCF', 2]]",FCF,13.020000457763672,13.489999771118164

t3_b8sh0p,Consolidated Water Co. (CWCO) Long Thesis,"**Background:**

Consolidated Water Corporation (CWCO) is a seawater desalination and water distribution company. They operate in four main segments, Retail, Bulk, Services, and Manufacturing. Retail segment supplies water to end-users in Cayman Islands inn 2/3 highly populated areas given by government. Also has a desalination plant in Bali, Indonesia. The Bulk segment supplies water to gov owned distributors in Cayman Islands and Bahamas. The Services segment does desalination plant management and operating services and the Manufacturing segment manufactures & services water products from 51% equity in Aerex Industries in US.

**Thesis:**

My price target on Consolidated Water (CWCO) is **$19.12**, based on the following reasons:

· 13.5% growth in the next 5 years and decreasing to 9.32% in the terminal year. This growth is organic and driven by their increase in operations in Mexico and in the United States

· Market is expected to double by 2026

· No debt, $31m in cash which gives the company flexibility

· Long term contracts that are not set to end in the next 10 years

**Concerns**

· Their EBIT margins are around 15%, which is half of the industry standard.

· Bad acquisition strategy that turn a strong balance sheet into a poor one. However, given that their past acquisitions have gone well (Aerex Industries) so it is not a huge concern.

**Key Ratios/Statistics**

· $191m MC, $161 EV

· ROIC = 5%, Cost of Capital = 7.38%

· $31m cash, $1m in debt

· 2.67% dividend

&#x200B;

Current Price: $12.75

My Price: $19.12

Upside: 49.95%

&#x200B;

Hopefully you found this thesis interesting. The last one I did generate a lot of good questions, so I hope this does the same as I feel that I have gotten a lot better at modeling. I welcome all questions/comments, I personally do not have much experience in this industry so if there’s any red flags please point them out in the comments.

t3_bempha,FISV & FDC Merger,"I have been intersted in FISV for years. Curious to hear any opnions, especially about the technology at First Data, which seems to be ahead of FISV. here is a good summary from a hedge fund I like

FISV is a leading provider of bank technology, which encompasses account processing systems and ancillary solutions such as bill payment, card processing, debit payment and online/ mobile banking. One in three US banks employ its systems, on which run 140mn deposit accounts, while in 2018 it moved over $75tn and processed more than 30bn digital payment transactions. It supplies mission-critical services for which demand is non-discretionary and as a result, over 85% of its revenues are recurring. The company’s long-term track record has been exemplary, and EPS has grown at double digit rates for 33 consecutive years, but its revenue growth has been limited to c. 4% recently, because of a failure to execute effectively on some new initiatives and the continued consolidation of its core client base of small and medium-sized banks and credit institutions.

FDC is the world’s largest provider of both card issuer processing and merchant acquiring solutions.

The issuer processing business has more than 4,000 financial institution customers, 1.2bn cards on file, and deals with 25bn transactions annually. It can route debit transactions from 121mn cards over its “STAR” debit network/ rails. The merchant acquiring business provides payment acceptance solutions for both physical and eCommerce transactions and offers payment technology embedded within a wide range of software solutions. The company captures 40% of all US point-of-sale (“POS”) transactions, at more than 6mn locations, and >$2.4trn of annual volumes globally. The POS market has moved away from relatively standard legacy terminals to smarter variants, which offer a simpler on-boarding process and ERP-type software to small businesses, and FDC’s “Clover” product has gained significant traction with over 1mn of these terminals in use and payment volumes processed are growing by an estimated 40% YoY, off a 2018 base of $70bn.

FDC traded on 9x 24 month forward earnings before the deal, because of its high financial leverage (4.7x net debt/ EBITDA), its history of ceding market share to more nimble, technologically advantaged competitors, the market’s unwillingness (so management believes) to recognise substantial recent improvements and reinvestment in the business, and, finally a significant share overhang from its private equity owners (KKR).

We like this deal for several reasons.

It is highly accretive for FISV. The combination of $500mn of revenue synergies, $900mn of cost synergies and the re-financing and pay-down of FDC debt will result in over 50% accretion to FISV’s EPS at the full synergy run-rate. We believe the visibility of these synergies is high and that the company could achieve more because management does not account for significant platform consolidations. Furthermore, the accretion forecast is net of an incremental $500mn of technology spend, which we hope would have some pay-off.

We see the value of integrating FDC’s merchant acquiring solutions (particularly Clover) with FISV’s account processing distribution network. The vast majority of FISV’s banks lack a merchant acquiring offer, and the cross-sale of FDC’s products into their SME customer base will yield incremental revenues, add further stickiness to their customer relationships and improve their ability to compete with disruptors such as PayPal and Square. Merchants will likely want to use a solution from their bank because of the overall benefits of buying from one provider and their ability to manage their banking relationships through Clover (they will, for example, be able to obtain working capital finance from their point of sale terminals).

We also think this deal is more strategic in nature than the market realises. Scale matters in payments, and the deal will make the combined debit businesses of the two companies stronger, while the combination of FISV’s directory of 140mn accounts and FDC’s large merchant acquiring business could provide strategic optionality in this fast-changing industry.

We do not feel that FISV’s CEO would have risked his excellent reputation and the company’s track record to do a deal whose rationale hinged on cost-cutting alone and it is interesting that, since the announcement of this deal, FIS has merged with WorldPay, a higher growth, better positioned, but far more expensive peer of FDC.

The pay-off from this transaction should yield durable EPS growth over the next 4-5 years.",13,0.8,1555600382,"[['FISV', 2], ['FIS', 1]]",FISV,85.01000213623047,86.73999786376953
t3_betorh,Linamar Corporation (LNR.TO),"Linamar Corporation is a global auto parts company (based in Canada) that manufactures powertrains and drivetrains for vehicle and power generation markets. It is the second largest auto parts manufacturer in Canada, behind Magna, with a market capitalization of $3.5 billion. The company is split into two segments: a transportation segment, which makes vehicle engines, transmissions, drivetrains, and bodies; and an industrial segment, which makes mobile-industrial and agriculture equipment. The transportation segment accounts for four fifths of Linamar's revenue.

At the moment, Linamar shares trade for $53.09. My intrinsic value estimate ranges between $66.5 to $73.5, with a rough target price of $70. If my price target is correct, Linamar has a potential Margin of Safety of 25%. While not quite a bargain, such a discount may be attractive to some given current low returns.

Linamar has a seven year average NOPAT/EV yield of 7.6%, and a current NOPAT/EV yield of 11.3%. The current ROIC is 11.9%. Over the past seven years, the highest ROIC has been 18.6%; the lowest, 8.9%; and the average, 14%. The capital structure seems fairly optimal, with debt representing roughly 30% of the total capital structure. Average seven year EBIT covers current interest payments 7.7 times.

Linamar has consistently paid a quarterly dividend since 1995. The current dividend yield stands at just 0.92%, however, compared with a 3.3% yield on the S&P/TSX index. While the company does not appear to have repurchased shares within the past decade, they have announced plans to repurchase up to 10% of their stock over the next year, in order to correct (as per the CEO) [""a significant level of under valuation of Linamar stock.""](https://www.fool.ca/2019/01/29/this-industrial-stock-is-buying-10-of-its-stock-should-you/)

While the company appears to not face any significant financial risks, it does face business risks materializing in the form of auto tariffs of 25%. How substantial these risks are to Linamar's long term prospects is hard to say (their 2018 annual report provides little insight into the matter). Linamar has only been minimally impacted by the previously enacted steel and aluminum tariffs. [For the time being, Trump has backed off the threat of auto tariffs, citing the threats as a ""negotiating point.""](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/10/02/trump-abandons-threat-of-auto-tariffs-on-canada-saying-it-was-just-a-negotiating-point.html) Personal politics will likely affect one's opinion on whether such affirmations can be taken at face value--I reserve comment. NAFTA negotiations may have scored a boost today, with a new congressional report finding that [free trade would likely increase U.S. GDP and jobs](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-impact-study-1.5104030). Ratification of NAFTA would be a plus factor going in the favor of Linamar's future.

The case for Linamar's undervaluation relies largely on the outcomes of trade policy negotiations. In my opinion, the likelihood and severity of auto tariffs on Linamar's general long term prospects do not warrant too much pessimism on that score. Linamar is globally diversified, and has room to grow abroad. Should decent conditions prevail, Linamar trades at an attractive entry price. Linamar has the size and financial strength to weather any reasonable vicissitudes that the future holds, and should create satisfactory shareholder value--barring significantly adverse conditions.

t3_bgazzf,Accounting for Uber's hybrid and equity investments made possible by divestiture,"The following questions I intuit can be answered by those who have an understanding of accounting common to companies with complex balance sheets, discontinued operations, and a history of divestitures and don't require a few hours venture into Uber's S-1.

&#x200B;

I am starting to dig into Uber's notes to consolidated statements which include details on extraordinary additions to the IS, BS, and CF.

&#x200B;

Essentially Uber records their equity investments in a joint venture with Yandex (MLU B.V.) by noting the net consideration (valued equity holding in MLU B.V. minus cash and equity contributed to MLU B.V. and other Uber assets within the geographical region of Russia) of their investment which saw them divest their wholly-owned subsidiary Uber Russia in exchange for 38% ownership of MLU B.V. and a board seat. This figure (net consideration) when added with the carrying value of assets transferred represents the gain on disposition. And the difference between the cost of Uber's investment in MLU B.V. and Uber's pro rated share of MLU B.V.'s assets is recognized as the basis difference which is largely comprised of equity method investment goodwill. Therefore, it happens that the carrying value of the investment is less than the fair value of consideration received by the 38% stake in MLU B.V. and greater than the basis difference or even net consideration.

&#x200B;

**Therefore, how do I reconcile carrying value if it is different from (in order from largest amount to least) fair value of received consideration, net consideration, gain on disposition, basis difference, equity investment method goodwill.** In addition, gain on unrealized investments impacted the IS greatly for FY 2018 based on the first quarter divestiture of Uber Russia and stake in MLU B.V., **how could one forecast the impairment account to equity method investments such that the carrying value is increased/reduced and added/subtracted to other income (expense)?**

&#x200B;

Secondly, Uber's divestiture of its Southeast Asian operations were made in exchange for Grab' Series G preferred stock which include a redemption right that requires payments of 6% interest on a compounded basis from the original amount of preferred outstanding. Due to this redemption feature the investment is classified as an available-for-sale debt instrument whose change in fair value is reflected in other comprehensive income (expense) on the IS.

&#x200B;

It seems to be a stretch to calculate preferred stock as a debt instrument when the only feature that would qualify it as a hybrid instrument is contingent on the lack of existence of a Grab IPO before 2023. **What possible reason would Uber have for classifying the investment as a debt instrument, so reporting any possible impairment could be avoided (that preferred is inherently riskier and the accounting may reflect as such)?**

&#x200B;

**More broadly, how should these investments be treated in the BS on a forward looking basis? How do they factor into Uber's value in a discounted cash flow framework?**

 On November 1, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Illumina, Inc. (“Illumina”) and FC Ops Corp., a whollyowned subsidiary of Illumina (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which Illumina will acquire us for $8.00 per share of our common stock in an all-cash transaction and FC Ops Corp. will be merged with and into us (the “Merger”), with us surviving the Merger and becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of Illumina. Completion of the transaction is subject to terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including expiration or termination of any waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and clearance under the antitrust laws of certain non-United States jurisdictions. At a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on January 24, 2019, our stockholders, among other things, approved the adoption of the Merger Agreement. We and Illumina have each received a request for additional information and documentary material, commonly referred to as a “second request,” from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) in connection with the Merger. The FTC’s “second request” has the effect of extending the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger until the 30th day after substantial compliance by us and Illumina with the “second request,” unless the waiting period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the FTC. The parties have entered into a timing agreement with the FTC that extends the waiting period of the “second request” to mid-2019. **We and Illumina continue to expect the Merger to be completed in mid-2019,** at which time we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Illumina and will cease to be a publicly-traded company. No assurance can be given that the required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, even if all such approvals are obtained and the conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals.

t3_bhw48w,Canfor Corporation (CFP.TO),"Canfor Corporation is a Canadian softwood lumber and integrated forest products company. Its subsidiary, Canfor Pulp, manufactures kraft pulp and paper. It is active throughout North America, with lumber mills in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Southeastern United States. The company has a market cap of $1.7 billion, and revenues of $5.044 billion (ttm).

Currently, Canfor trades at $13.87. My intrinsic value estimate ranges between $19.94 to $25.23. While the stock was trading at a third of my lowest intrinsic value estimate earlier this week when I first observed it, in the time following it appreciated slightly, and now only shows a 30% Margin of Safety.

In my attempt to value Canfor, I computed an estimate of the company's owner's earnings to the firm. After carefully reviewing depreciation rates employed by the company, I decided that the depreciation figure provided was acceptable, and charged it against cash flows. Canfor's average five year owner's earnings yield to enterprise value is 14%, and its current earning's yield to enterprise value is 20.3%. The company has reported two owner's earnings deficits over the past decade, and an operating cash flow deficit in 2009.

The ROIC has been spotty, however on average it has been satisfactory. Over the past decade, the average has been 8.48%, and over the past five years, 11.45%.

The company does not pay a dividend, however it does [repurchase shares](https://www.canfor.com/docs/default-source/news-2018/nr20180305_cfp_-canfor-announces-renewal-of-normal-course-issuer-bid.pdf?sfvrsn=6505ec91_2) (and has done so on a consistent basis since 2013).

Canfor's seven year average EBIT cover its current interest charges 11.7 times. Its bonds, $408 million worth, are backed 62% by cash, and backed fully by working capital. Its bonds account for 23% of the company's capital structure. Its current ratio is 2.63, and its quick ratio is 1.01.

The company has achieved satisfactory growth over the past decade--it is, however, facing headwinds due to oversupply in the lumber industry.

Canfor is a decent quality company, which in my opinion is trading below a fair, conservative appraisal of its earnings power.

Fits a multimodal distribution, consider playing momentum come offering price even if it gaps significantly above opening. I'm going to be watching the range between the previously rumored IPO implied price per share at $120 bill EV (\~$65) and the next highest frequency of relative value price targets at $77-80 whilst playing momentum once clearing the $92 mark where there is a valley in frequency of price targets. **Note: This is not a long-run analysis, of which I'm still working on a DCF (revised PT @ $55 a share). This is if one is aligned with the heretofore zesty IPO runs.**

&#x200B;

By dissecting Uber into its constituent parts \[Ridesharing (Core Platform), Uber Eats (Core Platform), Uber Freight (freight trucking brokerage), Uber Elevate (Jump) (dockless e-bikes), Advanced Technologies Group (AV, Vertical-Take-Off-Landing)\] and using comparable companies that operate in each of those segments, Uber valued at $80-90 billion appears to be relatively undervalued on the basis of LTM revenues and gross bookings from each of its segments. It’s ridesharing business alone merits the valuation it will receive in the public markets.

That is, if you can appreciate the already frothy valuations of a narrative driven high growth comp set, Uber’s ridesharing business on an average/median implied TEV/LTM Rev/Gross Bookings foundation fetches between $88.2 billion and $108.8 billion of enterprise value.

Uber Eats (Uber’s online restaurant marketplace and food delivery segment) contains a lot more discrepancy in a sum-of-the-parts comp valuation with estimates between $12.7 billion and $61 billion in enterprise value.

These disparate figures are due to a comp set including businesses which happen to be either whole or majorly invested in the online food marketplace with limited percentages of their business dedicated to delivery (Grubhub, Takeaway.com) or of which outsource delivery to third-party logistics firms altogether (Just Eats). Therefore, when using implied TEV/GMV) averages or medians (which less information is available on then LTM Rev), it is harder to reconcile Uber Eat’s segment gross bookings (total dollar value of restaurant earnings, Uber Eats driver earnings, and Uber’s take) with peer gross merchandise value such as Grubhub’s cited total food sales which exclude a calculation of delivery fees either fulfilled on behalf of the restaurant or Grubhub. It is likely that TEV/LTM rev is a more accurate multiple on a comparable basis.

Uber’s freight trucking Brokerage business faced similar discrepancies on a percent difference basis of implied enterprise value. This is due to the fact that the comp set included both pure domestic ground freight companies solely involved in brokering shipments between shippers and carriers (Convoy) as well as larger logistics conglomerates which offer trucking transportation, warehousing services for shippers, and who fulfill a variety of different methods of transport including air freight, intermodal, and ocean bound transportation (C.H. Robinson). Therefore valuations were not only varied based on the scale of the comp set and differing maturities of the businesses (third/fourth private stage rounds vs. public 20 years+ companies) but also because of the differences in comparing TEV to LTM gross revenue and LTM net revenue which represents revenue less the cost of transportation and services. The cost subtracted from gross revenue to arrive at net revenue wouldn’t exist for a pure freight brokerage unexposed to the physical infrastructure required to move goods and therefore provides a valuation of Uber’s less capital intensive freight brokerage segment between $228 million and $1 billion with the more likely valuation range between $715 million and $1 billion.

Uber’s wholly owned dockless e-bike subsidiary is described alongside its ridesharing business and consequently fit into a category Uber calls “New Mobility”, owing to Uber consumers’ range of transportation options which are transforming the way travel within 30 mile distances is conducted. Due to the inability to back out JUMP’s revenues and gross bookings beyond that of only 2018 in addition to its peers, a valuation is harder to come by. However, Uber did purchase JUMP in May 2018 for $139 million with $100 million recorded in goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired’s net assets.

Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) which is largely purposed to developing autonomous vehicle technology was established in 2015 with 40 researchers from Carnegie Robotics. The AV wing of Uber has manufactured 250 AV units and has embarked on a trident partnership strategy with OEMs such as Toyota, Volvo, and Damier. Their partnerships are diversified in scope. For example, they have partnered with Toyota in 2018 to retrofit Toyota cars with their developed AV technology (a partnership with DENSO has also been added to the general agreement between Uber and Toyota). They are partnered with Volvo to develop their own fleet of AVs. And they expect to integrate Damier’s fleet of owned-and-operated AVs into their transportation network. Therefore, it appears that they may be targeting multiple approaches to enabling AV technology within their platform given the high degree of uncertainty that exists in AV with respect to regulatory environments related to TNCs, OEMs, and the pace of AV adoption itself. Recently, Uber has raised $1 billion from SoftBank for its ATG which has implied a post-money value of $7.25 billion for the group. The AV comp set includes the following: Waymo, Cruise, Tesla, Apple, Zoox, Aptiv, May Mobility, Prontoai, Aurora, Nuro, Damier.

A sum of the parts analysis with the most appropriate multiples (net rev vs. gross rev, gross bookings vs. GMV) when averaged places a value on Uber Technologies Inc. at approximately $141 billion. And on a median basis $119 billion. It seems apt that Uber is pricing at a little bit above their latest post-money valuation of $76 billion in light of Lyft’s oft decreasing valuation. It also happens that this pricing is on par with a relative valuation of their ridesharing business alone which seems appropriate given the company’s distance from profitability, the unexpected nature of AV, and the still nascent status of their “other bets” such as Uber Freight. However, what may be overlooked by those who forecast little to no upside for Uber at this valuation is the supplementary driver liquidity that arrives with the value proposition to drivers when both Uber Eats and Uber proper are opportunities for sustainable income making with one’s vehicle, in the case of Uber Eats even for those who have a bike or scooter. Ultimately, the Uber Eats business as both a marketplace and delivery operation is proven and gaining market share in their served geographies. This portion of TEV is what makes me confident in determining that Uber’s sustainable value is above what the IPO price implies.

Therefore, when taking into account how recent tech IPOs have been perceived by investors, especially concerning the fact that most of the segmented comps used to calculate TEV are private companies with less fervent private valuations, investing in Uber seems to have an asymmetric risk profile that would result in short term positive returns and which would only appreciate further insofar as execution begins to ramp up in the various bets that Uber has already invested a significant amount in and in the industries they intend to disrupt. Post-IPO they’ll be sitting on approximately $15 billion in cash which is nearly double the amount Lyft has on their balance sheet.

   * Non-GAAP G&A as a percent of revenue will increase 4 pps in Q2 from Q1 and peak at 26% of revenue in Q3 and Q4

&#x200B;

**Observations/Scrutiny**  


* It is moderately troubling that gross bookings isn't being reported especially when the counter intuitive explanation for not doing so were to avoid ""investor confusion"" as other segments of the business which have a negligible impact on the top line are areas where revenue equals gross bookings, i.e. Lyft owns their own capital in their e-scooter business. Gross bookings is a metric useful in deriving an understanding of the scale of a given TNC and calculating the implied take rate which is one component in forecasting driver liquidity and utilization rates. Reporting of ride milestones ""from time to time"" is a step down in the level of disclosure from the S-1 too. However, less disclosure on rides may be justifiable given that there are bike subscriptions that Lyft offers where an unlimited amount of bike rides are accessible for a fixed dollar amount. 
* Brian Roberts (CFO) cites reduction of S&M as a percent of revenue from 127% to 54% to 37% by 2018. This statistic isn't impressive as revenue has increased by 141% to 75% to 48% and is a testament to the benefits of businesses reliant on network effects anyway. 
* Brian Roberts also mentions that Lyft's ""strategy is to win on experience, not price"" while competitive pressure has ""recently receded"". However, it seems highly unlikely that either of these statements are true given that excess driver incentives and customer discounts have been more aggressively put forth by both Uber and Lyft. Additionally, smaller TNCs are able to gain market share or more aptly reworded in the case of ridesharing a shared market, given competitive pricing (see Via). 
* Logan Green (CEO) responded to a question inquiring about the performance of specific initiatives toward attracting riders and increasing the number of active riders, especially having done so in Q1 2019 to achieve a new record of active riders which increases each quarter anyway. Logan responded by mentioning the Shared Saver feature which is only live in 3 markets and the first rollouts of the bike and scooter in-app integration, both of which are new and currently limited features that don't relate to the increase in the record number of active riders vaunted on the call.
* Lyft is increasing the number of ESG snippets to contribute to their brand's goodwill in what they think will allow them to differentiate themselves from Uber and maintain loyal riders. Some of these actions have been voluntarily buying carbon offsets to make every ride on the Lyft platform carbon neutral and launching a program where riders who opt in will pay their fares in rounded amounts with the excess being donated to a ""handful of nonprofit\[s\]"". I remain unconvinced that this would curry brand loyalty. 

&#x200B;

**Notes**  


* Release of new product feature ""Shared Saver"" which decreases the price for shared Lyft riders by pairing nearby riders to the same pick-up location
* High-value mode ""Lux"" has grown twice as fast as the rest of the ridesharing modes such as Lyft, Shared, Lyft XL
* Introduction of Lyft Direct which provides a no-fee bank account and debit card where Drivers can instantly access their earnings after each ride and Lyft Driver Centers which offers discount on maintenance, repairs and car washes for Lyft drivers' vehicles

* Expected deployment of Waymo vehicles on the Lyft platform in Q2 2019 and to reach 10 vehicles in Q3
* 300,000 users got rid of their car in the last quarter
* Expect 2019 to peak in terms of pro rated losses
* Reducing insurance costs via mitigating the frequency and severity of accidents
* Investments in telematics to assess speeding and braking, predictive analytics to assess fraudulent claims, transition to a new third-party claims administrator to reduce claims cycle times
* No plans for international expanison
* Each insurance initiative has a different timeline for unlocking benefits

t3_bsmsmn,"Security Analysis - Implenia, 1.8 x EV/EBITDA","  

**1 Introduction/ Summary**

Implenia is a swiss construction and construction services company that is involved in infrastructure development, as well as building construction and civil engineering. The company had some short term operational problems in 2018, causing the stock price to decline over 60% from its peak in mid 2018. 

&#x200B;

According to SIX Swiss Exchange, insiders bought CHF 1 m worth of shares in December of 2018. 

&#x200B;

If the company can realize their guidance for 2019 and return to an average historical valuation multiple, there’s 78% potential upside from the current stock price in the short term (<= 1 year) and more than 150% in the mid term (<= 3 years).

&#x200B;

All of the investor information and annual reports are available in english on the companies website.

&#x200B;

**2 Strong growth in the last 10 years**

The company has grown substantially in the past 10 years. Revenues have increased by 7% annually to CHF 4,4 bn for FY 2018. The order book is worth another CHF 6,2 bn. 

&#x200B;

While the top line growth has been impressive, the margins are very slim. The company has been earning a 5% EBITDA margin on average, with FY 2018 coming in at just 2,1%. 

&#x200B;

Free cash flows have been positive over the past 10 years, with a conversion of EBITDA to FCF at around 50% on average.

&#x200B;

At the same time the dividend was steadily increased from CHF 0,70 in 2009 to CHF 2,00 in 2018, before being cut back to CHF 0,50 this year.

&#x200B;

With the current market capitalization of CHF 560 m and a net cash position of CHF 397 m, the EV is just CHF 163 m. With an EBITDA of CHF 89,7 m for FY 2018, the company currently trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 1,82.

&#x200B;

**3 What happened to the stock price**

In July of 2018, the company anounced, that long term CEO, Anton Affentranger, steps down from his position. Appointed as new CEO, Andre Wyss, a former Novartis manager with no prior experience in the construction business. 

&#x200B;

With the release of the Q2 results in August, the company had to revise its guidance, stating that „the \[record EBIT\] target \[of CHF 140 m\] will probably not be achieved this year“.

&#x200B;

In December, the company adjusts its outlook for 2018 yet again: „As of today, management expects to make value adjustments totalling CHF 70 to 90 million for the 2018 financial year as a result of one-time write-downs and lower earnings from ongoing business in parts of the International Segment.“

&#x200B;

Finally, the company confirms its December outlook in February of 2019: „The profitability has suffered significantly due to the value adjustments announced in December. The EBITDA amounts to CHF 89.7 million (2017: CHF 173.8 million).“ Furthermore: „The dividend payout to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting is CHF 0.50 per share (2017: CHF 2 per share).“

&#x200B;

**4 Why I think the company is cheap**

I valued the company against its own historical value, as well as based on an intrinsic value calculation with a standard DCF model. 

&#x200B;

Both methods show a potential upside of over 78% from today’s stock price.

&#x200B;

4.1 Multiple valuation, relative to itself

The company is currently trading at an EV/EBITDA of 1,82. The average valuation over the past 10 years was 4x EV/EBITDA. That’s including the depressed valuations at the hight of the european souveraign dept crises in 2011 and 2012.

&#x200B;

If the company can realize the EBITDA outlook for 2019 of CHF 150 m and return to historical average valuation multiple of 4x EV/EBITDA, the stock would trade at CHF 54,00. That’s 78% upside from the current price.

&#x200B;

If the company can achieve its mid term guidance (which it still confirms after lackluster 2018), i.e. CHF 5 bn in revenues, 5,25% EBITDA margin at the low end and 5,75% at the high end, the share price could go up to CHF 78,35 and CHF 83,76 respectively, assuming a 4x EV/EBITDA multiple. That‘s 158% to 173% upside from today‘s price.

&#x200B;

4.2 DCF valuation

The DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of CHF 68,06 per share, assuming a low annual revenue growth rate of 2%, returning back to 5% EBITDA margin and a 10% discount rate.

&#x200B;

**5 Macro tailwinds**

5.1 Interest rates; short to mid term

Low interest rates facilitate higher spending in infrastructur. The ECB interest rate is currently at 0% and not expected to increase any time soon. In Switzerland interest rates are actually negative.

&#x200B;

5.2 Increased government spending; short to mid term

At 0% interest rate, monetary policy is exhausted as a means to facilitate growth in Europe. With decelarating growth or even a recession, governments will have to increase their spending in infrastructure in order to help the economy. 

&#x200B;

5.3 Mobility and infrastructure investments; long term

By 2035, CHF 2,4 trillion will be invested in economic infrastructure in Western Europe (vs. CHF 1,9 trillion in 2017).

&#x200B;

5.4 Urbanisation; long term

By 2050, 87% of the population of Western Europe is expected to live in urban areas (vs. 79% in 2018). 

&#x200B;

**6 What could go wrong**

6.1 The new CEO

Wyss might not be able to follow in the foot steps of Affentranger and continue the trajectory his predecessor had put the company on. 

&#x200B;

Although Affentranger should get a lot of credit for the growth of the last 10 years, many shareholders have critized him for being solely focused on top line growth to the detriment of the bottom line. The new CEO has the opportunity to get the company on a path of more moderate, but profitable growth, which he has already communicated as one of his priorities.

&#x200B;

Besides, current chairman of the supervisory board, Hans Ulrich-Meister, a former high ranking Credit Suisse manager, is not known to be a passive bystander. If things should go south with the new CEO, he will step in.

&#x200B;

6.2 Deeper issues with the international business 

Admittedly, it‘s hard to asses the extent of the operational issues with the international business from the outside. The company has said that the problem is contained and no further depreciation of the project in question is expected. They‘ve already put measures in place to prevent similar incidents in the future. 

&#x200B;

6.3 Macro headwinds

Implenia has already proven to be fundamentally robust to adverse macro environments. They were able to increase revenues and earn constant margins during the great financial crisis and the european souveraign debt crisis.

&#x200B;

**7 Possible Catalysts**

t3_bsfqdj,Is RLGY a steal or a value trap?,"I need to read earlier annual reports to get a better picture of the company's operating history, but from the numbers, it looks like they did a capital restructuring in 2012, reducing debt in exchange for a lot of share dilution.

In 2013, with free cash flow of $492 they had a market cap of $7.2b. Through the restructuring process the company always maintained EBIDTA of $500m+, an EBITDA margin on sales of about 12.5%. EBITDA margin in 2018 has declined to about 11%.

Free cash flows for 2018 were $394m.

I understand there are some competitive pressures from Berkshire Hathaway and Zillow. BH has had some very positive numbers and has the greatest ability to expand by acquisition. Zillow is extremely disruptive and potentially more so in the future, but so far they are playing with the realtor community, probably because most buyers/sellers prefer to work with a human being for this type transaction.  On March 27, BH ranked Number 1 in US residential real estate, BH HomeServices [surpassed](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/real-trends-500-report-ranks-nations-largest-real-estate-firms-300819128.html) Realogy's ([RLGY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RLGY) \-0.5%) NRT unit this year, which logged in 337,235 transaction sides closed. Sounds very intimidating, but its not like HomeServices got bigger the same way Geico did, via organic growth, it's via acquisitions, so its less intimidating. I'd imagine Berkshire continue to pile money into this business if it can make them a satisfactory return on capital.

But the brands under RLGY are not to be sneezed at, Better Homes, Century 21, Coldwell Banker, ERA, and Sotheby's are each individual brands that any reasonable buyer or seller would not blink to do business with. I haven't had time yet to look at the other brands that I know less about.

Recent quarter results were worse than last year and for the first time in a decade they reported a quarterly EBITDA loss. Q1 always has negative net income, although this year was much larger than usual: Since 2014, net income for Q1 has been: -$46, -$32, -$42, -$28, -$67, -$99 (2019). Due to 9% decline in quarterly revenue.

Q1 2019 operating EBITDA was negative $4M vs. positive $34M a year ago.

An executive recently bought $1,000,000 of shares  @ $8.38 on May 8, stock currently trades @ $7.13.

Most of the above summary should set off red lights.

EBITDA to Interest Expense ratio is currently 2.82 (2.49 in 2013, 2.68 in 2014, 3.26 in 2015, 4.37 in 2016, 4.52 in 2017, 4.38 in 2018).

Management claims to pursue up to $70m in annual cost savings. This will no doubt further compress margins in the meanwhile.

Current market cap is $814m, EV is: $4.5b.

They earned $394m in free cash flow last year, bought back $402m of stock, while adding $250m of debt.

Dividend is about $40m per year, or about 5%.

Bonds are trading at $91, $94, $99, and $100 for 7.4%, 10.4%, 5.68%, and $3.125, respectively, With maturities of 2023, 2027, 2021, and 2019, respectively. Total long term debt stands at about $3.33 billion.

Is RLGY heading to wind down, or is the stock price actually cheap right now due to an over-reaction to recent operating fluctuation? 

How do you guys think about this company, and the stock?

More questions that come to mind. Is there something broken about the company that is not obvious, or is there something obvious that I'm missing? Are gross margins as a % susceptible to shrinkage, if so, to how much? Are brokers eager to leave RLGY for competition due to some cultural reason? What is the minimum maintenance operating expense needed to support the RLGY agent network? What can we learn about the real estate market when reading RLGY financials, and vice versa? At what price would a private buyer take over the company, or an activist investor buy its stock?

t3_bujuvn,Some ideas on valuation and the flaws of relying on it,"Hey everyone,

I just joined this sub after I was looking for a place I could get some feedback on some thoughts I've been developing about equity valuation.  This likely is all a bit jumbled, so I apologize in advance.  As a disclaimer, I'm likely wrong about some (if not all) of this, but I've been thinking about it for some time and can't find where I might be wrong.

Basically, I've been thinking lately about how analysts spend so much time building hyper-complex three-statement models, complete with revenue builds and an absurd number of line-items.  Now, these are absolutely useful in understanding a company's financial condition, margins, growth, etc, but are extremely unreliable when trying to determine what price to purchase a stock at.  There is far too much ambiguity.  If you, me, and ten others all built a model and DCF valuation for P&G, we would likely all come up with a different price target.

Plus, even if an analyst can perfectly project a company's financials and link it all into a FCF DCF, there is no guarantee the company's stock price will align with its calculated intrinsic value.  A stock price represents the consensus view of millions of individuals at a given point in time, and if they are all determining their opinion using different models and valuation methods, the stock's price won't line up precisely with the target of the one analyst who did it correctly.

So, since projecting a precise target is not an effective way to generate alpha, what is?  Well, many analysts rely on sell-side price targets for the trajectory of a stock, believing that, over time, a stock's price will roughly follow the trajectory of its earnings.  They think if a stock is trading at $50 and the Wall Street consensus target is $60, the stock will trend upwards.  In some sense this may be true if enough investors take action on the Wall Street recommendation. EDIT: I know investors seldom if ever take sell-side targets at face-value.  But, many cross-check their valuations against the sell-side ones, and there is a bias towards some degree of alignment with them.  Many amateur investors also take sell-side recommendations, as do many financial advisors.

I could go on longer in another post about why I think Wall Street recommendations should be taken with a New York-sized grain of salt, but I'll just give the executive summary of my current opinion: analysts have rarely been accurate with their price targets in the past.  Most use comp multiples in their valuations, which are a) extremely subjective to manipulation, which is problematic since analysts are incentivized to put out ""buy"" recommendations, and b) inherently ignore the state of the broader market (if the entire market or sector is overvalued, the comp multiple will be unjustifiably higher).  Plus, sell-side analysts do not have (to use Nassim Taleb's phrase) skin in the game with their recommendations - aka they do not have to put their money where their mouth is.

Many investors end up going deep into the weeds in building monster financial models for their valuations.  I'll admit it can be fun doing this as a sort of puzzle.  But, I believe that after a certain point the more complex the model, the less accurate.  There's a fascinating study about professional odds-makers for horse racing.  A group of them were asked to place odds on a race between 10 horses, and were told they could have any 4 pieces of data for comparing them (i.e. jockey weight, age, breed, etc).  They forecasted with 19% accuracy, which is not half bad.  They reported they felt about 10% confident (I may have the numbers slightly off) in their conclusions.  Then, they were asked to project another race, and this time were given more pieces of information.  After several iterations of this (up to something like 30 pieces of data), their accuracy had remained about constant, but their confidence had risen significantly despite the stagnation in accuracy.  So, complexity and extra information is not always as beneficial as one may intuitively think.

The main conclusion I've come to is that there must be a more simple way to value a stock that accounts for reality - meaning the actual behavior of the market - along with some degree of fundamentals instead of all one or the other.

For example, I've been considering this valuation technique:

* The historical harmonic average P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is 14.25 (monthly since 1928).  The average annual EPS growth over that time was 6.32%.  Both appear to revert to the mean over time.
   * Hence, this seems to be a better way to capture the average perception of the market: 6.32% earnings growth warrants a 14.25 P/E multiple
* So, a company with >6.32% growth should trade at a higher multiple, and one with lower growth at a lower multiple
* Then, you add an adjustment for risk.  A company with 6.32% growth but less risk (narrower distribution of possible outcomes) than the average company should trade at a higher multiple, and vice-versa.
* Finally, you add on a margin of safety (i.e. 5-10%) to compensate for unexpected events and forecasting error.

This method would only require calculating a growth rate.  This could be done with a simplified income P&L forecast sheet, and would be easy to run a sensitivity analysis on.

&#x200B;

The qualitative factors are, therefore, the most important piece of your analysis.  There have also been studies showing that people making decisions who have lots of quantitative data will overweight their decisions towards quantifiable indications while missing qualitative ones.  Buffet and Munger do not spend their time modeling out depreciation and CAPEX or equity issuances.  This is not to say these factors should be ignored, but there is an opportunity cost in spending too much time on them, and, according to what I've seen, decreasing marginal returns the deeper into the weeds you get.

I remember a speech where Munger was asked, ""What is the best investment advice you could give someone starting in the industry?""  He responded, ""Most people seem to think we use some magic formulas and complicated ideas to make decisions.  Back a few decades we just saw most cities had only one major newspaper, and some had two with one slowly dying.  So we bought all the good ones.  Does that seem like a complicated idea?""

t3_buczwr,JD.com accounting,"Dear all,
I am an investor in the company JD.com. One issue has bothered me for some time related to the company, and I would like if you could clear it up for me since I am not that proficient when it comes to accounting:
Each quarterly earnings report since JD Digits (what was previously JD Finance) was reconsolidated (starting with Q4, 2017) has noted that the receivables of JD Digits have an impact on JD's operating cash flow (CFO). These reports then present FCF and remove this impact on the CFO from the FCF. 

I don’t fully understand how, mechanically how this works. On the one hand, it makes sense to me that, since JD still absorbs the credit risk for the receivables of JD Digits, these should be removed from its cash flow. After all, if JD Digits was still consolidated, then the loans it made to people for purchasing JD products would be counted as cash outflow, while the cash that JD then received from these customers would be cash inflow. These would cancel each other out. So subtracting the positive effect these receivables have on CFO (as has been the case the last few quarters) allows us to see the true cash flow situation now that JD Digits is deconsolidated. 

However, once these receivables are actually received by JD Digits (i.e., paid off by the borrowers), then JD no longer absorbs the credit risk for them. So if these were subtracted from JD’s CFO (in calculating FCF), should they be added back to CFO once they are received?

I also have essentially the same question for what happens once the receivables are securitized and sold off to third parties (which JD describes in its most recent quarterly earnings 6K). Once this is done successfully, shouldn’t the amount sold off be added back?

Thanks for your help.

t3_bvppb0,High risk; high reward; Qudian (QD:NYSE),"Recently, I initiated a long position on QD:NYSE (Qudian). In the past year, QD have repurchased >25% of their entire market cap in shares. They're also growing at around a 20 - 25% clip, but have been priced for failure - despite all evidence to the contrary, sentiment is unbelievably bearish. Should the stock price drop (which it most likely will given the negative China sentiment), I have 2 more bullets ready to fire.

Full 15-minute deep dive into QD:

&#x200B;

Due to the economic conditions they've wound down their DaBai Autos lending sector. Having said this, they've now dedicated 100% of their focus to growing their micro-lending business - in Q1 of 2019, the majority of their revenue growth came from off-balance sheet transactions, reflecting them shifting their business model from direct lending to lending intermediary (which addresses the regulatory crackdown concerns). They've forecasted revenue for FY 2019 to be at least RMB 3.5B; if we have some favourable exchange rates this should see their PE per ADS down to \~3!

&#x200B;

QD does not come without its risks though - if we dig carefully into their 20-F, we'll see that even though they're growing off-balance sheet transactions aggressively, they have guaranteed their institutional lending partners any defaults - this means they will pay the shortfall of defaulted loans that haven't been repaid (in-part or in-full), to their finance partners. Having said this, it looks like they're sensibly managing their delinquency rates at \~3-4% (and slightly decreasing).

&#x200B;

Should QD continue to exercise prudent management of delinquents, I believe they will soon mean revert back to a fair valuation, once the fears of regulation, trade war, China slow down, and etc. have blown over.

t3_c0i66t,Reading between the lines: What Slack didn’t disclose in its IPO filing," Slack Technologies, the developer of the popular namesake team collaboration messaging app, recently [applied](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8) for a public offering on the stock market. This is not a classic IPO, but a “direct listing,” also known a “direct public offering.” This means Slack is not raising money by directly selling shares and instead allows early investors and employees to sell their shares in the public offering. Music streaming service Spotify held a successful direct listing last year.

This story caught my attention for a simple reason. In August 2016, I joined the team developing a still-undercover product called Workplace by Facebook—a direct competitor to Slack. I worked on the product for 2.5 years. Back then, I dreamed of having an opportunity to look inside Slack’s business metrics.

It may seem that Slack has revealed a lot of data about the business in their [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8), a document that is almost 200 pages in length.

The reality is, they haven’t. The company had already disclosed in various ways much of the information compiled in their report.

But if we combine the data disclosed in S-1 filing and the experience I gained while working on Slack’s competitor, we’ll be able to uncover interesting details that will paint a more holistic picture.

I must say that this article contains my personal thoughts on the matter, jotted down while going through their S-1 filing, and should not be considered as investment advice.

## Slack’s top-level business metrics

* Slack doubles its revenue every year: $105.1M, $220.5M, $400.5M (respectively from 2016, 2017, 2019).
* Gross margin remains at the level of 87-88%. This doesn’t sound bad at all, although it isn’t unexpected from a fully digital product that costs several times more than its direct competitors.
* There is a lot of talk in the press about Slack’s unprofitability; the company shows a net loss of about $140M per year. But if we take a look at the cost structure and growth drivers (we’ll get to this later), then the losses won’t look like a problem. You can read more about this [here](https://tomtunguz.com/slack-s-1-analysis/).
* Slack estimates the market opportunity of workplace business technology software communication platforms at $28B per year. My own evaluation of the market stands at about the same number.
* Slack’s S-1 reminds us of the true costs of venture capital. The founders are left with 8.6% and 3.4% of the company. Meanwhile, the biggest shareholders are VC firms Accel Partners (24%), Andreessen Horowitz (13.3%), and Softbank (7.3%).

## Number of free and paid Slack customers

* Approximately 588,000 organizations use Slack.
* However, the concept of “organization” is rather vague in the report: “We define an organization on Slack as a separate entity, such as a company, educational or government institution, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a subscription plan, whether free or paid. Once an organization has three or more users on a paid subscription plan, we count them as a Paid Customer.” So, if there are 15 IBM teams using Slack, does it count as one organization or 15? It’s not clear.
* 88,000 of these organizations are paid customers, and over 500,000 organizations use Slack’s free subscription plan.
* Therefore, 15% of the active organizations are paying for the service. But this doesn’t give us a lot of information. Imagine 100 new companies register with Slack, but 99 of them stop using it after a while, and one remaining company purchases one of Slack’s paid plans. In this case we can say 100% of active companies are paid customers. But looking at it from a different perspective, only 1% of new companies become paid customers.
* My assessment of a long-term retention rate from a new organization into an active one for Slack is 5–10%. This is a very rough estimate. Moreover, long-term retention rates differ greatly depending on industry and acquisition channel.
* This estimation is based on my personal experience and the following quote from an old [interview](https://firstround.com/review/From-0-to-1B-Slacks-Founder-Shares-Their-Epic-Launch-Strategy/) with Slack’s founder: “Most people who fill out the form and hit submit — more than 90% — never invite anyone or start using the software.”
* If this estimation is correct, then 588,000 active organizations indicate that 5.5–11 million new organizations joined Slack over the service’s entire lifetime. This means that Slack gets about 115-230k new leads per month.
* If the estimate of the total number of organizations is correct, then the conversion rate from a new organization into a long-term paying customer stands at around 0.8-1.6%. If we factor in the average churn for SaaS (approx. 50%), then the conversion rate from a new organization signing up with Slack into the one that pays at least once will stand at around 1.5-3.5%.
* In many ways, Slack’s cleverness is hidden behind its strong brand and a huge flow of new organic leads. We will talk about it further on.

## Slack’s user engagement

* Slack’s DAU stays at around 10 million users (these are the users who either created or consumed content in the service at least once in 24 hours). The dynamics of DAU looks impressive.
* Slack had previously revealed its overall DAU and DAU of its paying users. But in the S-1 filing, it only mentions the overall DAU. This might signal that the growth of paying users has slowed down. Overall revenue growth is being pulled out by raising prices through the introduction of new tariffs and Slack for Enterprise taking a greater share of the revenue of the service.
* More than 1 billion messages are sent via Slack every week. This means that the average active user sends 14 messages per day. This is a good level of user engagement, but it’s not extraordinary or impressive.
* An average active user spends 42 minutes per day in the service. In comparison, active paid users spend an average 90 minutes in Slack per working day. These numbers don’t look bad. But when compared to the average 14 messages sent per user, they look dubious.
* The big question is, how does Slack calculate time spent in the product? A few years ago, they simply looked at the time the service was active on users’ devices. That has changed, but the company mentions no specific methodology in their filing, which makes it difficult to interpret the numbers.

## Slack’s business model

Even without a report, Slack’s business model seems obvious, but the company laid it out eloquently in the filing:

“We offer a self-service approach, for both free and paid subscriptions to Slack, which capitalizes on strong word-of-mouth adoption and customer love for our brand. Since 2016, we have augmented our approach with a direct sales force and customer success professionals who are focused on driving successful adoption and expansion within organizations, whether on a free or paid subscription plan.”

Here are the key points:

* Slack gets most new customers organically through word-of-mouth(self-serve model).
* Some of the new organizations convert into paying customers.
* The sales team works with leads that qualify as large organizations.
* The goal of the sales team is to increase Slack’s penetration within large organizations.

Let us now reflect on some of these points in more detail.

## The top of Slack’s funnel is driven by organic signups from word-of-mouth

“We offer a self-service approach, for both free and paid subscriptions to Slack, which capitalizes on strong word-of-mouth adoption and customer love for our brand.”

The first question that occurs after reading this sentence is, why doesn’t Slack accelerate growth by investing in acquisition through paid ad channels? It isn’t hard to verify that Slack almost doesn’t invest in Google Ads or Facebook Ads (there are some paid ads, but they’re mostly focused on branded search).

Here’s the short answer: The SMB (small and medium-sized business) segment’s economics doesn’t justify paying for ads because the return on investment is negative (ROI < 0). Meanwhile, direct advertising channels don’t work for the enterprise segment. 

Now here’s a more detailed answer:

* The average cheque for Slack’s paying customers is $380 per month.
* If we ignore companies that Slack considers as enterprise customers (with more than $100k ARR), then the average cheque per month will be $230, and the average organization’s size will be 40 people.
* Thus, a self-serve client brings \~$2,760 in revenue in the first year and \~$2,400 in gross profit in the first year.
* If the goal is to get a positive return on investment (ROI) within 12 months, then, then a long-term paying client should cost $2,400 in the self-serve segment.
* With a 0.8-1.6% conversion rate into a long-term paying customer, a new organization should cost $20-40.
* But in B2B, leads from organic channels usually demonstrate 2-4 times better metrics than the leads from paid advertising channels. Let’s assume that in the case of Slack, the difference is 2x. This means in order to get ROI > 0, Slack needs to acquire new organizations at a cost of $10-20.
* This looks unrealistic if we consider the economics of paid advertising channels in developed markets, where the average cost of a new organization from Google Ads or Facebook Ads will be around $100-200.
* That’s why Slack invests nearly nothing in paid acquisition. It grows mainly through strong brand, word-of-mouth, integrations with other services and the subsequent cross-promos, the professional communities in Slack and tools for communication between companies.

On the one hand, Slack is shielded from competitors because it has a huge number of organic leads and due to the fact that paid acquisition doesn’t work in the market, it is nearly impossible to get close to Slack in the self-serve segment.

On the other hand, as you will soon see, the self-serve segment acts as a gateway to reach enterprise customers. But Slack’s competitors have other ways to reach these companies.

## Net Dollar Retention Rate is the most interesting piece of data Slack revealed

The following chart shows the growth of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) by cohorts based on the year when organizations first paid for using Slack.

ARR from organizations that first paid for Slack in 2015 continues to grow steadily in the following years.

For most products, cohorts shrink as they age. But in Slack’s case, we’re witnessing the opposite (this is also called Negative Revenue Churn). This is one of the main reasons why Slack is worth so much ($7B valuation at the latest funding round, $10B proposed valuation for the public offering).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvfzpl7vla431.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=3634cf8ede9a4f8fb1f0eb974752f5d10088d96e

However, it is worth noting that such growth patterns are typical for products in this kind of market. Zoom, which recently went public, has a Net Dollar Retention of 140%. Twilio and Atlassian showed even more impressive figures at the time of their IPO ([source](https://tomtunguz.com/slack-s-1-analysis/)).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gix4fovvla431.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f44393afabbccdbb49adf609015cc63f114f42d

The following are the main growth drivers:

* Expansion of the user base within companies that are already using the service: Slack is building up their sales team, which reaches out to companies that have already started using Slack, and does everything to get the remaining employees to switch to the service.
* The organic growth of customers: Companies that have started using Slack are hiring new employees and growing in size. More employees -> more Slack users -> Slack gets more money.
* Price changes: Slack raises prices directly or by introducing new tariff plans.

An interesting consequence here is that Slack’s growth depends more on how the team is developing the product and the growth of its current customers than on attracting new users and converting them into paying ones.

Acquisition, of course, is just as much important, but it has a rather delayed impact on the overall revenue growth.

Another consequence is that such growth mechanism depends greatly on having enough enterprise customers with many employees who have not yet started using Slack (it will be difficult to grow revenue from of old cohorts if all of them are SMBs with 40 employees).

If you look at the growth of new paying customers, it doesn’t look promising. Slack added 22,000 paying customers in 2017 and 29,000 in 2018. This is a 30% increase in new paying clients, but still not the kind of dynamics Slack would like to see.

Therefore, the main driver of Slack’s exponential revenue growth is the expansion of cash flow from its old customers.

Slack measures this process using the Net Dollar Retention Rate metric: They take all the customers who were already paying 12 months ago. They then divide the current MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) by the MRR for the previous 12 months.

Net Dollar Retention Rate for the last three years looks like this: 171%, 152%, 143%. That is, customers who paid a year ago pay much more in the following year. Which is fantastic. Net Dollar Retention Rate is gradually decreasing, but this is expectable due to the slowdown of growth in old cohorts.

Here’s what Slack’s report says about this:

“We disclose Net Dollar Retention Rate as a supplemental measure of our organic revenue growth. We believe Net Dollar Retention Rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain, and grow revenue from, our Paid Customers.

We calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the MRR from all Paid Customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or Prior Period MRR. We then calculate the MRR from these same Paid Customers as of the current period end, or Current Period MRR. Current Period MRR includes expansion within Paid Customers and is net of contraction or attrition over the trailing twelve months, but excludes revenue from new Paid Customers in the current period, including those organizations that were only on Free subscription plans in the prior period and converted to paid subscription plans during the current period. We then divide the total Current Period MRR by the total Prior Period MRR to arrive at our Net Dollar Retention Rate.”

## Enterprise is a problematic segment for Slack

If you have enough patience to go through the entire 200-page report, you will notice Slack repeatedly showcasing its success in the enterprise segment. This segment accounts for a significant part of the market ($28 billion spent on communication tools each year), and this is what Slack is striving for. This is the where their long-term growth lies and where they are getting Net dollar retention rate > 100%.

Here’s what the report says about this segment:

* Customers should have ARR > 100k to be considered enterprise customers.
* The number of enterprise clients in the past three years: 135, 298, 575
* The revenue share of the Enterprise segment in the past three years: 22%, 32%, 40%
* Revenue from enterprise customers over the past three years: $23M, $70.5M, $160.2M
* Average monthly spending by enterprise customers in the past three years: $14,200, $19,700, $23,200
* The largest customers have “tens of thousands of employees” or tens of thousands of active users per day—quite an ambiguous wording (“our largest Paid Customers have tens of thousands of employees using Slack on a daily basis”).
* For the last two years, almost all of the Slack product releases have been aimed at adapting the product to large organizations. Take for example Slack Enterprise Grid, adding Threads, Unread section.

At first glance, it does look impressive. But let’s take a closer look.

* Customers should have ARR > 100k to be considered enterprise customers. This means that organizations with over 1,000 employees using Slack fall into the enterprise segment. This is a rather low threshold. I assume it was chosen to get a larger absolute value of enterprise customers.
* Even with such a low threshold, Slack only has 575 enterprise clients. It is not much. Even Facebook Workplace, which entered the market much later (and doesn’t have such a phenomenal influx of organic leads), announced three months ago that it has 150 companies with more than 10,000 employees on the platform ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/facebook-says-that-workplace-now-has-2m-paying-users/)). And Teams, Microsoft’s Slack competitor, which launched even later than Workplace, has also achieved similar figures ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/teams-microsofts-slack-competitor-says-its-signed-up-over-500k-organizations-adds-whiteboard-and-live-events-support/)).
* Another way to look at 575 Enterprise customers is to compare it to the total number of organizations that have created a Slack workspace (5.5 – 11 million). Only 0.01% of them achieve enterprise status. Slack is very skewed towards the SMB segment, which suffers from a high churn rate and has very little potential for expanding revenue from its old customers.
* Major customers have tens of thousands of employees. It sounds impressive, but those who have worked with products focused on the enterprise segment know that there are many companies in the world with hundreds of thousands—and even millions—of employees (and usually they are outside the technology sector). A few examples of Facebook Workplace’s customers are Walmart, with 2.2 million employees, Starbucks with 250,000 employees, and Telenor with 37,000 employees ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/workplace-facebooks-enterprise-edition-snaps-up-walmart-as-a-customer/)). In terms of revenue, onboarding Walmart equates to signing up thousands of companies with 1,000 employees. This is not an attempt to say that Workplace rocks, but rather to mention that Slack finds it difficult to strike big deals.
* For the last two years, almost all of Slack’s product releases have been aimed at adapting the service to large organizations. This is true, but Slack doesn’t do it for fun. Slack loses most of its deals to competitors when trying to sign up enterprise clients, because the service works poorly for companies with over 500 employees, and even worse for companies scattered across different time zones. Synchronous communication, which is Slack’s forte, starts to falter under such conditions.
* And now regarding the blind spots that Slack was silent about in the report. The report has no clear breakdown of Slack’s customers by industry. This is an important question, since Slack initially grew in the IT and media segments. And it is unclear whether they managed to step beyond these limits, and how the product performs in more classical verticals (e.g. banking, retail, insurance, etc.). If Slack experiences problems there (as it previously has), then the market of $28B will be dramatically narrowed down to the niche of the technology business, which isn’t very impressive.

And here’s where things get really problematic for Slack:

* Microsoft already has access to a lot of large enterprise clients from all verticals and has been selling them products bundled in a single package for a long time. They recently added Microsoft Teams to the Office Suite, which is just as good as Slack in terms of functionality. Does Slack offer enough incentive to convince enterprise customers to forgo the benefits of their long-term relationship with Microsoft?
* Workplace by Facebook was originally designed for large organizations and outperforms Slack product-wise in this market segment. Moreover, Workplace works great outside the technology sector too because the product’s interface is very familiar to the masses, which means companies save a lot of money and time since they don’t need to do any employee training.

In the next 5-7 years (indeed, B2B and especially the enterprise sector are slow-paced markets with one of the longest transaction cycles) it will be thrilling to see how Slack responds to these threats and challenges.

## Summing it up

* Well done for Slack. They won over the self-serve market segment and no one even comes close to them.
* Just as much as Slack enjoys its growth in the self-serve segment, they make the best out of it using it as a source of enterprise leads for the sales team, which then spreads Slack inside large corporations.
* Slack is growing rapidly and will continue to do so in the next few years (mostly due to the expansion of revenue coming from the old cohorts). However, what happens next is still a big question.
* Slack’s long-term growth depends on how much of the enterprise segment they’ll be able to conquer, and whether they’ll be able (or perhaps they already have – this is not clear from the report) to expand beyond the segment of tech companies.

t3_c5uuct,"Cost of capital - specifically cost of equity : vital, but impossible to calculate?","Hey all,

&#x200B;

I've been thinking lately about how so much of finance is predicated on the discounting of cash flows at a discount rate to determine the value of something (a security/project/etc) in today's dollars.  This is fairly do-able with fixed income instruments, but equities is a completely different story.

Every finance program I've seen teaches CAPM as one of the fundamental building blocks of stock valuation, along with WACC.  We all know the formulas: Er = rf + B ( Erm - rf) ; WACC = We(Ke) + Wd(Kd)(1-t)

&#x200B;

Given tiny fluctuations in the discount rate can significantly alter the result of a DCF calculation, effectively estimating Ke is very important.  The method we are given (and which until recently I took for granted) is CAPM, which takes the risk free rate, adds an equity risk premium to adjust the required return for the added risk of investing in equities instead of government debt, and then adjusts that term for firm-specific risk, quantified by beta.

&#x200B;

While building a valuation a couple months ago, I realized how much I could alter the output by simply calculating my Beta differently.  Regressing daily prices against the S&P 500 over a three year time horizon and monthly prices over the same horizon yielded significantly different results, as did changing the time horizon to five or one year.  Enough of a difference to shift the output from indicating 10% downside to 10% upside.

This got me thinking - why does Beta make any sense as a measurement of risk?  All it calculates is the covariance of the stock's returns and the market's, which is a measurement of volatility.  But, volatility shouldn't measure risk.  If I buy a stock today for $10 and sell it in five years for $30, it doesn't matter if the price was highly volatile or extremely stable over that time-frame.  Investment returns are vector, not scalar, meaning they are not path dependent.  Risk should be measured by the probabilities of realizing different possible returns over different time frames.  Beta does not measure this.

Calculating the expected return on the market is also difficult, and can be done in many different methods that yield results different enough to swing the output of a model.

&#x200B;

So, what I'd be curios to hear from you all is if anyone can think of a better way to estimate Ke.  Or, if I'm missing something here with CAPM (which is very possible, especially if there is a mathematical nuance of covariances I'm not understanding), I'd love to hear what it is.  I've seen enough credible people (Nassim Taleb in particular) criticize the use of CAPM, so I am semi-confident I'm not crazy.

I'm thinking there could be a way to use a Monte-Carlo simulation to develop a sense of what the cost of equity should be.  Maybe there is a way to quantify firm-specific risk based on capital intensity, operational/margin sensitivity, ROIC, etc.  Or, maybe the best way is to use a constant number and then use a sensitivity analysis to get a feel for the valuation range of a DCF at different Ke's.

Looking forward to hearing all your thoughts!

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm also aware that many (if not most) professionals do not use CAPM in practice, but I have yet to see a highly concrete calculation method.  I more am trying to stimulate a conversation about what Ke represents and how to translate the theory into an actual calculation.",61,0.9400000000000001,1561578822,"[['DCF', 2], ['B', 1]]",DCF,9.133999824523926,9.550000190734863

&nbsp;


Thanks for the thoughts everyone. Two main criticisms:

 
&nbsp;


*1) Lack of Competitive Advantage*

So this is probably the biggest hangup with this stock. I get people's anecdotal complaints about customer service, but realize all of these HSA providers have anecdotal experiences like these... all of them... The facts are that HQY has sustained HSA additions faster than their second and third largest competitor combined, and that HSA customers have proven to be exceptionally sticky. Another factor that was unmentioned RE: growth concerns is their revenue is tied to AuM, which not only grows from # of accounts under administration, but cash balances within the accounts, which only continue to grow year after year. It's also tied to prevailing interest rates, which not only serves somewhat as a hedge, but is arguably a secular boon given what 50-year historical rate curves look like. In addition, net income growth % will meaningfully outpace revenue/HSA additions as cash margins skyrocket and $ is plowed back into the business. From my perspective, it's hard to argue that customer complaints will hinder a 5-year compound 50%+ net income growth sufficiently to drop <25% given the overwhelming positives. To own this stock, you don't need any sort of catalyst or re-rating, you're actually betting on anything better than a de-rating and fairly pessimistic status-quo.

/u/galt325 made very important comments regarding competitive dynamic as well (enterprise decision, complicated nature of business, bigger institutions exiting biz) that argue against the importance of customer experience/fee (although these are important and I do believe HQY mgmt is privy to these factors!). RE: betting on other, cheaper competitors to ride the HSA trend, I would much rather go with the pure-play dominating the landscape. As mentioned, the magnitude of potential FCF generation is disconnected with the current price of the stock.

 

&nbsp;


*2) Regulatory Risk*

Regulatory risk needs to be taken into account, but in my opinion there's not much more to be said. As far as healthcare legislation goes, bi-partisan support is a big deal and HSAs have that.

 
&nbsp;


Again thanks for the thoughts. Maybe I'll post another thesis soon.


&nbsp;


**Original post:**


&nbsp;



I personally would like to see more original discussion on individual stocks/businesses so let’s have a conversation about HealthEquity (HQY)!

&nbsp;


**Why?**

To my knowledge, there have been no adequately articulated bull theses anywhere on the internet (save seeking alpha BS), one short thesis on VIC, and one short for a competitor WAGE (which somewhat translates into a bull thesis for HQY) on VIC. Over the last year I have become very bullish on this stock and business and it is one of my top holdings. Their latest announcement to acquire WAGE re-affirms my confidence in the management team/future growth/capital allocation of the business and I can’t help but pound the table on this stock. This will be very verbose so feel free to jump around but I’d like to get a discussion going regardless.


&nbsp;


TLDR: HQY is the early-mid innings of what will be one of the best, most stable, highest-ROIC businesses in the world. At a 4B market capitalization it’s trading at a fraction of intrinsic value. I estimate a 5-year 20%+ IRR from purchasing the stock at its current ($65) price.


&nbsp;


**The Industry**

&nbsp;


*The Problem with US Healthcare and need for HSAs*

News flash: there’s a healthcare spending crisis in the US. From ~6% of GDP in 1965, national healthcare expenditures total ~18% of GDP today and are projected to continue to eat more of the GDP pie. Healthcare quality has not improved proportionally. You could point to a multitude of causes but many congressmen/healthcare experts highlight the arcane, esoteric cost structure of the industry. Now there are 1,000 page volumes on why this is/how it works but long story short a major flaw is **lack of agency on the part of Healthcare consumers** (see [Consumer-driven healthcare]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer-driven_healthcare)). I’ll give an abridged version of this phenomenon. Identical healthcare procedures can fluctuate in cost 100-600%, with the same level of quality. I.e. if I’m getting a colonoscopy you can quote it out to 5 different places and receive prices **for virtually the same operation** for $800-$5000 (these are real numbers, svc charges include differing prep kits, diagnoses, sedation techniques, pathology, facility etc). The way many insurance policies are structured disincentivize consumers from shopping healthcare costs and actually making a price/quality decision, causing costs to balloon and providers/insurance co’s to make out like bandits (just look at ROIC of *those* businesses). So, there has been a big push to put cost/healthcare decisions back in the hands of consumers and make them more responsible for their healthcare choices.


&nbsp;


*How does an HSA help?*

Enter Health Savings Accounts (HSA). An HSA is a savings account offering triple tax-deductibility (tax-free contribution, growth, and withdrawal) for qualified medical expenses. HSAs and similar devices enable consumers to pay routine medical expenses/save for future costs while falling back on a High-Deductible Health Plan for large expenses. So now when I go and shop around for that operation, I’m going to have costs in mind (as the balance will fall into my pocket) and the idea is this should help control costs in the long-run for the country. HSAs were created in 2003 and grew rapidly to 4.5m accounts in 2007, 9m in 2013, and 25m in 2018. The rise in popularity of HSA/HDHP and similar plans demonstrate the efficacy/potential of this model. Arguably there is a secular shift which will increase the portion of ~190M under-age 65 consumers to adopt the HSA/HDHP or similar model.


&nbsp;


**The Business**


&nbsp;


*Overview*

HQY is a mission-driven first-mover and innovator/pioneer of the industry itself, with founder/CEO dynamics, offering HSAs coupled with health plans since 2005. Stephen Neeleman (VP/Founder, prior CEO) is an HSA expert and aggressively lobbies for HQY/HSAs in congress. Jon Kessler (CEO) previously founded WageWorks (NYSE: WAGE) a $2B company which offers competing products. It’s interesting that Kessler left WAGE (which focuses on inferior FSAs, being cannibalized by HSAs) to lead HQY and now is essentially pulling a Steve Jobs and acquiring his old company (more on that later). To say HQY is dominating this industry is an understatement. They have sustained growth for years higher than their second and third largest competitors combined. It’s a combination of astute management, industry know-how, aggressive marketing/sales/account tactics, strong company culture, and exceptional customer service. 


&nbsp;


*Competitive Advantage / “Moat”*

Other HSA Plan Providers: HSA Authority; Fifth Third, Optum, UMB Bank, BenefitWallet, HSA Bank, Further, HealthSavings Administrators, Bank of America


&nbsp;


As already stated HQY is dominating the competition. The fact that their fees charged are more-or-less in the middle of the pack demonstrate that **lower fee is not what drives the competitive dynamic**. Administrators can differentiate based on investment options offered, quality of those investment options, transparency of service/options, customer-service, robustness of technological platform, eligibility/compatibility with investment managers/health plans, ability of the admin to sell into company plans, etc. Long-story short… it’s not simply a race to the bottom on fees (ala retirement/trading accounts, which bears have pointed to). It’s much more complicated and based on a multitude of complex dynamics/relationships that lie at the center of the byzantine American healthcare system. HQY’s business provides: 

&nbsp;


1)	A liaison between consumers, healthcare plans (employers, etc), healthcare providers, investment managers, us govt (to continue to lobby new plans/savings vehicles)


2)	A robust technological platform integrating saving/spending decisions, healthcare bills, cost comparison, investment comparison, benefit information, wellness incentives


3)	Education and transparency to all parties, especially consumers


&nbsp;


Additionally, HQY is one of the few (and only major) competitors that made the business decision to solely focus on HSAs. In addition, as much of this business is network-based, there are inherent scale/network-effect benefits. It’s not an industry with a low barrier to entry and speaks to the large gap between HQY and the competition.


&nbsp;


*Revenue*

HQY had 3.5M accounts on their platform as of FY ’18, adding ~700K accounts each year since 2016. HQY generates revenue via

1)	Custodial: cash assets deposited with custodial bank partners/annuities with insurance partners (48%)

2)	Service: fees charged for monthly account services (31%)


3)	Interchange: fees charged on physical/virtual payment cards (21%)

Note the vast majority of revenue growth is coming from Custodial segment – tied to what is basically the “AuM” of the business/prevailing rates, and the long-term business strategy is to reduce other fees as a benefit to the consumer. As these three revenue sources are virtually disconnected from any consumer supply/demand dynamics, management has highlighted the unusual amount of stability/foreseeability (“90% visibility”) in all three sources. 


&nbsp;


*WAGE acquisition*

So as I’ll highlight in the next section HQY is a cash machine. They have sustained 100%+ ROIC and have just stockpiled cash/investments on the B/S with virtually no liabilities. So a huge question is capital allocation… and the newly announced WAGE acquisition reaffirms my confidence in that department. The acquisition will consist of total cash outlays of ~2.3B, funded by ~600M of cash and ~1.7B of new debt. They plan to rapidly deleverage with the high, stable, cash flow of the combined businesses. I’m not going to go into the details on WAGE’s business model, please see VIC short idea post for that, it’s a great writeup. Long-story short their margins are inferior, their products are inferior, and HQY is cannibalizing their business. The general idea is to convert a large portion of WAGE’s customers to the better-serving, fiscally constructive HSA/HDHP model. 


&nbsp;


**The Numbers**


&nbsp;


*Metric Definitions*

Cash Flow: OCF – Special Items – Maintenance Capex/Dev Costs

Net Liquid Assets: Short-Term/Long-Term Liquid Assets(Cash/Investments) – All Liabilities [included to show how HQY just stockpiles cash]

ROIC: Cash Flow / Operating Assets (Assets less mainly intangibles and cash)


&nbsp;


*HQY Financials ($mn)*

Year|Revenue|Cash Flow|Cash Margin|Net Liquid Assets|Operating Assets|ROIC
:--|:-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:
2013|46|11|24%|NA|NA|NA
2014|62|13|21%|-7|12|108%
2015|88|15|17%|96|17|88%
2016|127|26|20%|107|25|104%
2017|178|45|25%|163|29|155%
2018|230|81|35%|218|41|198%

2019 HQY cash flow (40% growth assumed, vs 80% last year) = (FY2018 CF) 81 * 1.4 = 113

2019 WAGE cash flow (15% contraction assumed) = (FY2018 CF) 127 * .85 = 108

2019 PF Combined cash flow = 221

2019 PF Combined Net Income =  67*1.4 (HQY) + 26*.85 (WAGE) = 116

(Tentative) Interest Expense = 3.5% (Libor + 120 bps) * 1.7B = 60

&nbsp;


The cash margins speak to the scalability here… their incremental margins is in the range of 70%+. They’ve compounded net income growth at 50%+ since their IPO. Anyone who has studied ROIC of businesses will immediately recognize how ridiculously lucrative this franchise is. You can argue against those adjustments (intangibles/cash) but it’s perfectly sound practice on the street/many shops. It’s a cash machine. Also realize there’s a thousand ways to calculate all these metrics but don’t get bogged down to lose the big picture here…


&nbsp;


**Risks/Bears**

The way I see it risk could be bucketed into three major categories which I will briefly address (and maybe leave some to you guys!) Note there is **a lot** I did not cover about this stock, leaving the nitty-gritty for Q&A:


&nbsp;


*1) Regulatory Risk*

It goes without saying, one stroke of a pen in congress can destroy most US healthcare businesses. It’s always a risk in this industry. HSAs have always had bi-partisan support and I personally believe cooler heads will prevail. Spiraling healthcare costs are one of the hottest issues the US faces and I think responsible decision-makers know CDHP is a solution not a cause of the problems.


&nbsp;


*2) Competition*


I have touched on this briefly in the writeup above.


&nbsp;


*3) Valuation*

Many investors get scared off by a 40x+ P/E valuation but you miss a lot of great investment opportunities with this mindset. I also go back to this quote from Buffett:

&nbsp;


> “The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to. Because then you feel so strongly about the product”


&nbsp;


**The Bottom Line**

So you’re looking at a business with a strong “moat”, high ROIC, reinvestment opportunity, recurring revenue, low churn, strong mgmt., industry-leader, that has sustained net income/cash flow growth of 50%+ trading at ~20x cash flow and ~40x net income. **Those multiples assume no synergies whatsoever on revenue/cost from the acquisition, which really are inevitable**. I predict HQY will manage to sustain net income growth of 25%+ over the next five years, and pay down a significant portion of the debt resulting in a net income figure of ~350mn, a ~10B market capitalization with a 30x P/E multiple, justifiable given the robustness of the business. At the current share price of $65, a 5-year holding period would generate an IRR of 20%.",25,0.93,1561751948,"[['HQY', 14], ['ROIC', 3], ['IRR', 2], ['FCF', 1], ['SVC', 1]]",HQY,63.34000015258789,64.66000366210938
t3_c8eonj,Afterpay Will Continue To Outperform (Updated),"Hey guys, this is a re-post as Beren wanted me to do a longer write up (full video analysis at end of post):

&#x200B;

For those of you who aren't familiar with Afterpay (APT:ASX), they are an Australian founded BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) provider.

&#x200B;

Since their inception 3 years ago, they've captured over 16% of Australia's addressable retail market, and have recently launched in the USA and UK. In their short time there, they've already captured the attention of some major retail brands, and are signing up approximately 10,000 new users per week (on their app).

&#x200B;

A week ago, VISA came out with an announcement that it intends to partner with its network to provide BNPL, and the APT share price fell off a cliff. However, the market has overreacted because Mastercard tried to do this in:

&#x200B;

2016 - failed

2018 (AMEX tried it too) - failed yet again

&#x200B;

The problem these companies face is that 2/3 of millennials don't own or want to own a credit card. Furthermore, APT works like a recruitment company, whereby the user e.g.: candidate gets a premium experience for free. As long as their users don't default, they are charged no fees or interest for being able to split their purchase into several installments - often, this is enough to tip a potential buy over the line, to make a purchase decision. Should they default, their accounts are suspended permanently - APT do not offer evergreen BNPL.

&#x200B;

In my video, I deep dive into stats detailing why millennials are more likely to purchase (online and offline) if there are some ""instant gratification"" incentives - 40 - 45% (buy and buy more), and 75% when it comes to e-commerce. I also deep dive into conclusive stats based on web traffic interest, backlinks, mobile and desktop user trends, and etc.

# Description

SMSI is a mobile application developer who sells to  carriers, which in turn sells to their subscribers. Similar to how Sprint bundles Hulu with their phone plans to end customers. I believe  SMSI is worth significantly more than it’s current valuation and the market have not priced in the following key developments:

**Main thesis:**

1. SMSI shifting revenue from low margin graphics business to high margin  mobile app business. Company grew gross margins from mid-70s in 2017 to  91% in 1Q19
2. Revenue and profit expected to increase QoQ over the  next 2 years. Revenue expected to grow from 23M in 2017 to 38M  (estimated) in FY19
3. Expected new partnerships with other carriers  in 2019, as guided by management across several major product lines.  Stock tripled when SMSI signed Sprint in late 2017.

SMSI  recently turned the corner and became profitable in FY18. I expect they  will continue to grow meaningfully while generating positive cash flow  QoQ.

It’s hard to run into an opportunity as compelling as SMSI.  Below I’ll provide a very brief background on SMSI and cover their  margins, growth and upcoming opportunities for the company and  shareholders. I believe the business will grow to be x3 – x5 it’s  current market cap of $100M over the next two years.

# SMSI: A brief overview

**SMSI Financial Profile:**

&#x200B;

The company is currently valuated at 100M, has zero debt, and $7.5M in cash at time of this writing.

https://preview.redd.it/rj8ibiu5ow831.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=858c66390a9b88a5f24109ffc039c5e8d290d8c2

&#x200B;

\*GAAP EPS. Non-GAAP EPS is generally 2c higher which excludes amortization and stock based compensation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Smith Micro Software is a mobile application developer with three main applications product lines:

&#x200B;

* \-SafePath: Essentially a location, family and parental control app.  Although they are growing the product line to expend into smart homes  (SafePath Home), and IoT devices (SafePath IoT).
* CommSuite: A  visual voice message app with integrations to Alexa and other smart  home devices. This product line up is also extending, although I’ll skip  the intro due the fact that the expansions are still being launched  with minimal revenue at this point.
* ViewSpot: An application  installed on a device in retail stores (think BestBuy, AT&T stores)  to provide guided tours for retail customers. These ‘guided tours’  control what shoppers see and how they interact with a device. AT&T  and Verizon are SMSI’s biggest customers for this product.

*The  company also has a legacy graphics business. This is a profitable  business but has negligible revenue contributions so I’ll skip the  intro. It contributes roughly $1M/year in revenue.*

&#x200B;

For more information, I recommend going to smithmicro.com to read more each of SMSI’s 3 main software products.

&#x200B;

For the purpose of this write-up I’ll focus on the business itself.

# Overview of Smith Micro’s Sales Process:

SMSI’s  has a deep sales relationship with all the Tier 1 and many Tier 2/3  carriers & MSOs in the US. Unlike most application developers who  releases their apps directly to consumers, SMSI white labels their  products to carriers and MSOs. Carriers & MSOs then rebrand SMSI’s  products as their own, and sells these apps their own retail customers.  Here’s a brief overview on how SMSI release their products to consumers:

&#x200B;

1. SMSI sign a revenue share agreement with a carrier, which has historically been around a 50/50 revenue split
2. Carrier pre-installs SMSI’s apps on their phones to be sold to retail customers
3. When retail customers purchase a phone from a carrier, the carrier have  the opportunity to upsell SMSI app subscriptions to these retail  customers, similar to how BestBuy upsell customers on insurance when you  buy a dishwasher
4. If retail customers purchases the subscription,  they are billed an extra few dollars per month, resulting in 100%  margins for carriers, and 91% gross margins for SMSI
5. If retail  customers declines the subscription, they have the opportunity to use  SMSI’s free-tier apps and subscribe to the premium version at a later  time

&#x200B;

This is a beautiful business model because:

\-	 Carriers receive 100% margins of these sales, while offering their  retail customers additional value provided by SMSI’s apps. Customers are  less likely to leave a carrier when they have multiple service  offerings with a single carrier (stickiness)-	SMSI receives high margin revenue with zero to no marketing expense

&#x200B;

For SMSI to grow, they need to:

1. Sign more carriers / MSOs, or
2. Grow their existing partnerships

&#x200B;

As we’ll discuss below, SMSI is currently growing on both fronts.

# Catalysts - why now

SMSI’s recently turned the  corner and became Non-GAAP profitable in FY18 (adjusting for outstanding  warrants), with positive cash flow expected in the next 2-3 years.  SMSI’s key growth areas is detailed below as well as their recent growth  rates and forecasted 2019, 2020 growth rates. Most of this is fairly  simple to model out given the recurring nature of their revenue.

**1. Growing existing partnerships**

&#x200B;

SMSI signed and begun ramping up Sprint for their SafePath application in 2018. This single relationship has grown from $200k in 1Q18 to $2,100k in 1Q19 revenue. Management has also guided towards continued growth in 2019.

Below we show SMSI’s 3 key applications and their current and expected growth for 2019, and 2020.

I’ve included 2018 and 1Q19 (actuals) revenue for reference.

https://preview.redd.it/dpjuqsldow831.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1ea07413084a9f636660cc7ac41903e63b8339b

&#x200B;

A few assumptions:

1. I assume conservative growth of 100k/Q for CommSuite, based on CC guidance and 1 on 1 calls with management
2. I assume a growth rate of 30% for Q2 for Safepath, an 400k/Q thereafter. The 30% growth comes from guidance from conversations CFO Tim Huffmyer (who has historically been fairly conservative with his guidance). And the $400k/Q thereafter uses a historical average. This does not take into account the expected Sunset of Sprint’s legacy subscriber base to SafePath, which will bring an additional 3M/Q in revenue to SMSI. You can read more about this in SMSI’s 2Q18 or 3Q18 CC transcripts.
3. Viewspot is a new purchase in late 2018. I assume growth to be conservative at 100k/Q for 2019, although speaking with management, they’ve told me they expects growth to be \~20-30%.
4. I assume no revenue for SafePath IoT and SafePath Home. Speaking with CFO Tim Huffmyer, he stated that it’s ‘too soon to tell’ on how much revenue these two new expansions will drive in 2019.

My forecast last year and Q1 has been fairly accurate to actual earnings releases (I expected 8.4M in revenue, they came in at 8.43M in 1Q19). I have fairly high confidence that actuals will come in line with these forecasts. If SMSI signs a new carrier, my ’19 and ’20 models will be revised accordingly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2.	Signing more carriers**

Last  year prior to SMSI acquiring ViewSpot, CEO Bill Smith had guided  towards signing a new Tier 1 carrier by 1H19 (all evidence points to  T-Mobile). This would a meaningful win for the company since T-Mobile is  50% larger than Sprint, and SMSI's stock tripled on the Sprint signing.

However  when asked about this guidance on 1Q19’s CC, Bill revised his guidance  in saying he expect the signing would go past his initial guidance of  1H19, but he now expects to sign a new customer for each of Safepath,  CommSuite, and Viewspot.

While I’m not as bullish as Bill, all  data points to T-Mobile has the next SMSI customer. I expect T-Mobile’s  delay may be tied to their impending merger with Sprint, which is  expected to close in the short term.

# So what’s SMSI worth?

&#x200B;

Below I share my revenue guidance for the company. A few granular points to note:

1. The company has higher expenses in Q1 due to higher sales variable cash compensation (bonuses), and trade shows at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), and Mobile World Congress (MWC).
2. The company is ramping up their engineering team for deployments at additional carrier wins this year. CFO Tim Huffmyer told he they currently have 20 open reqs. I have modeled towards increased R&D expense per Tim’s guidance.
3. For expenses, Tim has guided towards a $500k decrease in expenses for Q2, and fairly consistent run rate for 2019, with slight increases in 2H19 due to R&D
4. While management does not provide overall guidance, Tim did say he expects SafePath revenue to increase 30-40% QoQ.

&#x200B;

**SMSI Model**

https://preview.redd.it/am891y8low831.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac571332bb9def7a2d013f9739dfe82d8a156108

&#x200B;

A few key takeaways:

1. The company is expected to generate 0.21 in cash EPS next year. Shares currently rate at only $3.30/share.
2. The company has no significant cash obligations and is expected to generate cash every quarter

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

&#x200B;

As a microcap value investor, it’s easy to fall into value traps or invest in cigar butts. However when a true value opportunity arises, it’s hard not to get excited.

SMSI is a profitable software developer with high operating leverage, clean balance sheet, and growing 40%/year without even accounting for the expected large customer wins in the next 7 month.

I won’t dive to deeply on valuation as every investor has their own valuation methods and discount rates. Here’s my simple DCF model:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ax1oqw5sow831.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb4cea7bae13b8d623ba5b7294ffa3c65e24a0b

&#x200B;

A simple DCF valuates the company at **$13/share**. This assumes a 15% discount rate and did not include any future customer wins.

For terminal year, I valued the company at a simple PE of 10. Software application companies traditionally trade at PE of 25+.

If this opportunity looks compelling, I recommend doing your own due diligence and arriving at your own conclusions and value for the company. Please reach out if you find any mistakes or oversight on my part.

**Important Terms**

Registered User: Created an account, for free

User Cohort: Aggregation of users added in given time period

Premium Subscription: A package purchased by a user; a single user can purchase more than one subscription


**Cohorts**

Cohorts are referred to as a subset of users, categorized by acquisition date. It allows companies to analyze important subscriber metrics like churn, which is when a subscriber ends their paid subscription with a company.

**TROI (Time to Return On (Marketing) Investment)**

TROI can be found by this formula: Revenue gained per Subscriber / Cost to acquire each Subscriber

**How does TROI tie into Cohorts?**

Say your first month of business you gain 100 registered users with 10 of these users paying for a premium subscription. Next month you gain 200 more registered users with 20 of these users paying for premium as well as 10 more of the users from last month converting to premium. Each month your goal is to:

1. Get more users to register
2. Get existing ones to convert to premium
3. And reduce churn


Now say you invest $100 in marketing and in return gain $10 in revenue from subscribers. Overtime your revenue from subscribers will continue to increase as more people continue to pay their subscription or convert to premium. So that initial marketing investment will continuously increase revenue overtime.


So cohorts are important because they are a driving source of future revenue growth. You want last month's registered users to convert to premium and premium users to continue paying for their subscription.


**Wix Subscriber Growth**

- The company’s registered users increased to 142 million as on Dec 31, 2018, up 19% year over year.

- Total subscriptions were 4 million, up 24% year over year.

- Existing cohorts expected to generate future collections of $4.3 Billion

- Every new 100K Net Subscriptions = $165 Million in Collections over 8 years at an 80% Gross Margin

- TROI remained stable over the last 3 years while marketing investment and collections grew 2.3x


**What makes Wix stand out**


**New Products:** Improving and creating new products like Wix Ascend and Turbo create opportunity to expand their user base and convert users to premium subscriptions.

**Global Penetration:** Continued penetration into the company’s geographic area of operations will drive revenue growth into the future. 

**Brand:** Wix.com is the strongest brand in the industry with over 4 million average monthly searches from Jan-Mar 2018

**Partnerships:** Partnerships with the NY Yankees and Manchester City FC are a great way to reach new audiences in an engaging way

**Acquisitions:** DeviantArt, the largest online art gallery and community, was acquired by Wix in February of 2017

**E-Commerce:** Massive growth in e-commerce and transition to mobile sales will give Wix significant long term opportunities with global e-commerce expecting $5T by 2021, according to eMarketer",9,0.91,1562610875,"[['ADI', 1], ['FC', 1]]",ADI,111.4000015258789,116.08999633789062
t3_caxwld,Am I missing something or do IPOs seem like a really bad deal?,"I'm talking about your standard book build not the new direct stuff that slack and spotify did recently.

Anyway, thinking about it, as an investor, the way these deals are structured, it seems to me your upside is severely limited while your downside is not. 

You apply for your allocation through your broker. If its a popular IPO, it will be oversubscribed and your upside is scaled back as you get less shares than you applied for. Since high demand tends to equal high prices, when you make a good pick you're not rewarded as well as you should be. If on the other hand the IPO is a dud you'll get your full allocation and you'll get to experience the lovely likely subsequent shareprice drop in full. 

Unless you're absolutely certain the IPO price is way undervalued, I don't see why you'd want to participate. And lets face it if we could be certain about things we'd all just go to vegas and forget about this whole investing thing anyway. 

It's a game of risk vs reward and unless I'm missing something IPOs don't seem to add up very well for us pleb individual investors.",27,0.8300000000000001,1562659590,"[['SPOT', 1]]",SPOT,144.38999938964844,156.8000030517578
t3_cc5rkg,SRCI - SRC Energy - Valuing An Oil & Gas Company," 

Whilst I’m not a huge fan of investing in commodities like Oil & Gas, base metals, and etc., I thought it’d still be interesting to make today’s article and video about this topic, and will be using SRC Energy as an example company on how you may want to approach valuing Oil & Gas equities.

**Reasons why I dislike commodity equities:**

* Not only do you need to know your company, you also need to be fully across macro economics and socio-political factors - this will mean you’ll be at a significant disadvantage if you’re not an industry insider;
* Oil & Gas reserves are based on technical reports and analysis by “competent persons” - nobody can ever be 100% sure how much Oil & Gas is underneath the ground, hence the inherent nature of these equities are higher risk;

**What are reserves?**

There are 3 types of reserves:

* Proven - 90% of commercial feasibility to extract
* Probable - 50% of commercial feasibility to extract
* Possible (inferred/indicated) - 10% feasibility to extract

As mentioned above, this is measured by “competent persons” and is their best educated guess, based on various techniques and methods - it’s uneconomical to dig up an entire patch of ground or a seabed to make 100% certain, hence there is always room for human error.

There are also “resources”, which happens to be measured by the same group of “competent persons” - these are not classified as reserves because they’re less confident about these, hence why they’re classed as “resources” - all of this seems highly anecdotal to me, which is why as an average retail investor, I think it’s safer to discount the potential value of these “resources” (unless you’re well versed in reading 150+ page technical reports, drilling, fracking, engineering, geology, etc.)...

**What are SRCI’s reserves worth?**

Based on the tables below, I've used SRCI's proven reserves as per their FY 18 report. As you can see on fig 1, they have 88mm Bbl's of oil, 771.9 bn c/f of gas, and 89.1mm Bbl's of NGLs (proven).

On fig 2, I've plotted their operating and net margins - these are inclusive of cash costs, and all expenses such as royalties, sustaining CAPEX, OPEX, project CAPEX, and even derivative gains or losses (because commodity companies sell into the spot market, but they always have a portion of their book hedged).

What's important to pay attention to is that they will always achieve a sales price less than the spot price, for this very reason. Therefore, it's also important to discount the net value of SCRI's reserves by the average percentage difference in realized vs. spot price, in addition to a 10 - 15% margin of safety discount one would normally apply.

[Fig 1](https://preview.redd.it/2zl80eazms931.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d5c8a776f7018231b129be77b7c517b7fb7d50e)

**Other factors to consider:**

* The next oil bear and bull market - how long these will last for;
* What are the geo-political uncertainties e.g.: Libya, Iran, overproduction, undersupply, manipulation by OPEC, etc.;
* How American Oil & Gas companies can remain competitive, if they need to ship their exports across an entire ocean vs. Gazprom being able to deliver it directly via it’s pipeline network

**If you prefer a video analysis, please see below:**

[**https://youtu.be/It-1r3npH\_g**](https://youtu.be/It-1r3npH_g)

In summation, I believe SRC Energy is trading at or slightly above fair value, when comparing their Enterprise Value to net value of reserves (at the average price). If we see another oil bear market, then SRC Energy will become loss-making (like back in 2015-2016), therefore there is not enough of a margin of safety to consider this stock just now.",9,1.0,1562903360,"[['SRC', 4]]",SRC,44.439998626708984,44.02000045776367
t3_cdqj8t,Long Thesis on Unity Biotech,"**Overview:** This post seeks to articulate an investment thesis for [Unity Biotechnolog](http://ir.unitybiotechnology.com/)y (UBX). *I welcome any perspectives that challenge this thesis.* In light of Unity’s strong team, promising science, risk mitigation strategy, large market potential, loosely defined category, and recent pullback in valuation I believe this is an opportune time to begin building exposure to the company. Unity is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing drugs to extend human health span (defined as how long we live free of chronic diseases of ageing). Unity works across the spectrum of mechanisms that drive aging with a near term priority to remove senescence cells for patients with osteoarthritis (the main reason it hurts to be old). Senescence cells (SC) are cells that no longer divide and tend to poison around nearby tissue (cause inflammation). Beyond osteoarthritis, Unity will also work to rollout similar therapies for eye, pulmonary, and cognitive diseases which affects millions of aging individuals. Unity’s current market cap is 360MM, the company went public in May 2018 at a valuation of 700MM valuation.

**What difficult problem is the company solving (better than others)?** Key questions include: Why do people get sicker as we age? Are there drugs to halt, slow, or potentially reverse the mechanisms of aging? What is the most impactful disease to demonstrate the drug’s efficacy and safety? As context, quality of life decreases as we age due to a number of factors including stem cells (loss of mitochondrial function), nutrient sensing (caloric restriction as we age), circulating youth factors (loss of protein production) and cellular senescence (cells that no longer split and cause multiple issues in nearby micro tissue). Unity focuses on cellular senescence, not because it is the only or even most important aging mechanism, but because of all the mechanisms identified to date, it is the most “druggable” approach (i.e. easiest to make drugs and molecules to combat against). During the last 7 years, Unity has proven their thesis in mice allocating several rounds of venture capital to mitigate the main scientific questions and company killer risks. The scientific breakthrough leading to company’s creation occurred in 2008, when Judy Campisy (one of Unity’s co-founders) effectively showed that accumulation of SC poisons local tissue and contributes to diseases of aging, based on this and subsequent scientific research, the team at Unity proved that removing SC in mice (genetically engineered to age faster), not only increased lifespan by \~35% but improved bone density, mobility, hair growth, and decreased cognitive decline, materially improving overall health span. Unity recently completed Phase 1 clinical trials to prove safety and tolerability in humans with osteoarthritis of the knee. Over the next few quarters the company will work to replicate the technical success seen from removing SC in mice on humans and will continue to expand its pipeline. Next areas of focus will include ophthalmology, pulmonary, and cognitive diseases of age affecting millions of aging Americans.

**Is this the right/best team to solve this problem?** Unity features a solid team  (presumably the best) to succeed in this nascent but promising field. Nathaniel (Ned) David (President and co-Founder) co-founding four biotech companies (two exits large exists, one for $270mm another for $2.1bn) and gotten two drugs approved. Ned is also a tenured partner at ARCH Ventures (credible biotech VC firm with strong realizations). Sapphire Energy (genetically engineered algae to produce liquid transportation fuels) was a well documented failure executed proved leading bio-engineering and built production at scale, the company was backed with Bill Gates. Technical co-founders include two pioneers in the field of aging research: Judith Campisi (Buck Institute) and Jan Van Deursen (Mayo Clinic). Keith Leonard (former CEO at Kythera) acts as Unity’s CEO and has worked with Ned for 15 years and was a former senior executive at Amgen. The board features prominent VCs and scientists (Bob Nelsen and Kristine Burow from ARCH Ventures, Camille Samuels from Venrock, Margo Roberts former CSO of Kite Pharma). Financial backers include top-tier VCs and Family Offices featuring Jeff Bezos, Peter Theil, and Paul Allen among other prominent financial and strategic institutions that further legitimize the investment opportunity and caliber of the team.

**How will Unity capture, distribute, and realize value? Is their position sustainable and defensible?** Unity is a clinical stage/pre-revenue company focused on R&D. There is little visibility as to timeline of commercializing any of its drugs yet, let alone go-to-market strategy. This is common of early stage biotechnology companies. Guidance on pricing, go-to-market, and distribution will likely be provided as closer to Phase 3 and commercial viability. As customary, we expect the company’s position to be defensible though the use of patents, intellectual property rights, as well as exclusive licensing and/or royalty structure with leading larger pharma partners.

**What is the market opportunity and state of competition?** The market for health span drugs is large given the tens of millions of aging baby boomers in America and other developed markets suffering from arthritis, pulmonary, eye and cognitive diseases related to aging with estimates of potential royalty payments between 2-5 billion. There are multiple smaller players in the field pursuing multiple other mechanisms but generally lack both credible talent and financial backing. Competition from large pharmaceutical companies is not evident at this stage but expected to increase as technical and commercial feasibility becomes more evident. A potential acquisition is a probable scenario but Unity also has the potential to become a durable and standalone commercial aging platform (releasing new drugs with little incremental cost) to generate large future cash flows streams.

**Why is now the right time to invest?** Biotech is a risky endeavor, it takes time and capital with significant binary risk. Due to the slow nature of clinical trials it could be 2-3 years before their thesis fully plays out -- by such time it may be too late to fully participate in the upside. Given this uncertainty, young and smaller capitalization companies fluctuate widely in value, making an investment highly speculative and prone to failure. As of July 2019, Unity has lost nearly 50% of its IPO valuation and trades at a small premium to all capital raised to date (market value to total paid-in capital of \~15%). Due to high R&D and overhead, a dilutive follow-on transaction is likely within the next 12-18 months. This investment represents an  opportunity to gain exposure to VC like risk/reward through a public vehicle. Unity looks like an option to get exposure to an emerging and large vertical of healthcare. Although highly speculative this seems like an opportune time to build a position in the company. Consider building exposure a 4-5% exposure at \~$8.5/share leaving reserves to accumulate more with more evidence of technical success. I welcome your views on this thesis\*!\*

t3_cenxkw,Qudian Update Analysis (QD:NYSE) - Potential 3 - 4 Bagger?,"Hey guys,

I've decided to make a follow up analysis (on QD) to my previous one back in May. Previous reddit post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/bvppb0/high\_risk\_high\_reward\_qudian\_qdnyse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/bvppb0/high_risk_high_reward_qudian_qdnyse/)

My initial analysis saw an 80% upside, which I believe was too conservative. Let's explore a few things below, to see why...

**QD is the top performer amongst its industry peers**

[Fig 1](https://preview.redd.it/ign2p50cmza31.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b406368e6baf1041ed421f27b55716ff79d44074)

As you can see in Fig 1, QD has the lowest default rates amongst its peers - the lower the default the better, because any default when it comes to lending means write-offs and charge-offs, which lead to impairments that hurt EPS.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, XRF is 7 months late on its 20-F, Q418, and Q119 reports - red flag. Moreover, JT's sales & marketing expense is >60% of its revenue, resulting in net margins of \~2%. YRD is not bad, but it still has a large portion of its funding coming from P2P sources. PPDF is also not bad, but what separates QD apart is how high the repeat borrowing rate is, and how low the default rate is.

&#x200B;

This is important because the cost of acquiring a new customers is 3 -5x that of maintaining your existing customers (source: Forbes).

&#x200B;

**QD has an issue of too much demand (this is a great problem to have)!**

&#x200B;

[http://ir.qudian.com/financials/quarterly-earnings](http://ir.qudian.com/financials/quarterly-earnings)

&#x200B;

Having reviewed all of their earnings call transcripts, the prevailing theme is that they have too much demand, and are playing catch up to secure funding, to service this demand. Despite growing their loan book to >35 billion RMB, they are still only able to service a fraction of their user base and approved borrowers...

[Fig 2](https://preview.redd.it/gcwyg0eqnza31.jpg?width=1166&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8833226eb38e03b0121678d72c2606cf23a1dcb)

As you can see on Fig 2, QD only serves \~5.5 million of their 29.1 million credit approved borrowers. This means they have the analytics and data for the other \~23 million not being served - a valuable asset - it's no surprise they launched their open platform to refer these to funding partners who can exceed their max lending limit of 6000 RMB; QD's CFO has stated on many occasions that they do not wish to exceed this sweet spot, as their target market is Chinese young people making 3000 - 5000 RMB per month (the under-served with no credit history).

&#x200B;

Since the inception of their open platform only 2 quarters ago, QD has referred 160,000 transactions for a total borrowing value of 1.8 billion RMB, with average borrowings of 8000 RMB per person (Q1 FY19 earnings call transcript notes).

&#x200B;

Based on this, I've used Fig 2 to project what could realistically be their revenue stream from the open platform alone, in the future quarters (serving a similar sized user base). Their take rates for their organic business is 13 - 15%, vs. 5 - 10% for referral business, but the referral business carries no risk and is effectively pure profit.

&#x200B;

**QD is misunderstood**

&#x200B;

For the purposes of my intrinsic value calculation, I will only use their current updated Net Profit FY 19 guidance, and leave all profits from the referral business as upside. Please refer to Fig 3 below:

[Fig 3](https://preview.redd.it/ie307uj3pza31.jpg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32aa9c88f5245f05a652283cecc3e9cf2fdf5fe7)

Based on current EPS and EPS growth, I've assigned a re-rate to a PE multiple of 10 - 12, and a 30 - 50% EPS growth for FY20. You may think this is too bullish, but my reasons are below:

* QD is still being lumped into the same group as P2P lending peers, despite them no longer conducting any P2P lending whatsoever;
* This is a young industry, hence I have limited data, but assessing the oldest of the group (YRD) and QD's previous PE historical trend, I believe 10 - 12 is a logical earnings multiple (see Fig 4 and Fig 5 below)

[Fig 4](https://preview.redd.it/1ts5ahenpza31.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7566ec0e0c89bb382030357b6eff01c8b3ace12d)

[Fig 5](https://preview.redd.it/k915hii8qza31.jpg?width=732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bc8a121b7af6177f487a4f0c3d236e3bc049dd3)

**Fig 6 - why I'm confident in another 30 - 50% EPS growth in FY 20**

Below are some relevant comments from QD's CFO, which highlights why I don't believe a 30 - 50% EPS increase for FY20 is too bullish. These comments are from their earnings call transcripts:

[Fig 6](https://preview.redd.it/9qji7dmgqza31.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=769e6faec331797f55812705fd116691ddf324d3)

**In Summation**

Based on the above, I believe there is sufficient evidence QD will be trading at the \~$25 - $30 range in the next 18 - 24 months.

&#x200B;

Disclosure: I'm long QD. None of this should be construed as financial advice, and you should always DYOR + consult a qualified professional before investing in anything!

You can read it here: [SNC-Lavalin: Buy A Highway, Get The E&C For Cheap](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275981-snc-lavalin-buy-highway-get-e-and-c-cheap).

 

Unfortunately the publication of my [article ](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275981-snc-lavalin-buy-highway-get-e-and-c-cheap)corresponded with a significant press release from SNC and a public statement from the CDPQ . On the news the stock went from $25 to $21 per share. That’s my timing for you.

Of course nobody wants to see bad news but I believe this is the news that we were looking for. I see the recent announcements as positives.  It’s like a doctor telling you that you are getting brain surgery to remove a tumor. It’s not good news but that’s what needed. Short-term pain for a better future.

In the article I said that I wouldn’t be surprised that the new CEO takes the quarter as an opportunity to ditch guidance and dump more bad news and that’s exactly what happened. SNC took a $1.9b impairment charge link to its oil and gas division, Kentz. They already took a $1.2b impairment charge back in February. SNC bought Kentz for $2.1b back in 2014. The CDPQ, the largest shareholder with 19.9%, publicly came out against the deterioration of SNC performance. Back in the spring the CDPQ said they will “be a rock” for SNC, I guess they are losing patience like everyone else.

SNC is facing many headwinds, operationally, financially, politically, reputationally…let’s quickly address them:

* SNC has been having operational issues. SNC some good assets and bad assets. The recent restructure announced will have SNC focus on its strong points. SNC is still in business. They are still winning contracts. SNC is walking away from Turnkey lump sump projects, the key source of its problems. Exit: O&G, mining, and construction which are its least profitable activities.They will focus on design, nuclear, engineering services “EDPM”.  They will be less risky and more cash-flow predictable. More details on the new strategy is expected in the fall. The future SNC might look like more of a WSP Global or Stantec.
* Finance: SNC took on a lot of debt for its WS Atkins acquisition of $3.6b in 2017. Despite paying a big price for Atkins, it’s one of the strong points of SNC today. To deal with the debt SNC is selling part of their private highway, cut the dividend, and is engaged on a cost cutting program. Once the sale is completed SNC debt’s level should be back to their historical norm of low debt. SNC also has $13.87 (post-H407 sale) of net assets in their Capital Investment Portfolio.
* Politics: Unfortunately SNC was in the middle of a political scandal for the Trudeau’s Liberal government. SNC was also a victim of a diplomatic spat between Saudi Arabia and Canada. There’s not much in SNC’s control at the moment. Hopefully after the election the government will finally find a solution to SNC’s legal problems.
* Reputation: SNC didn’t murder anybody but you would think they did. Their reputation is not good. It’s affecting employee morale and departures. The public perception of the company is toxic. SNC is managing a PR crisis. SNC, a 100+ year old company, has its brand; a once valued intangible asset is now in the garbage bin. You can change a reputation. Merck’s Vioxx is responsible for the death of 38,000 people and the company is still around. With SNC it will take time. I don’t expect anything before the Canadian Federal election in October. Plus they have to Libya bribery court case they have to deal with. It will take a lot of time, a string of good news/quarters, and communications to deal its reputation.

With the recent announcements, SNC has a market cap of $3.6 billion, the same price they bought WS Atkins in 2017. Atkins is one of the most respected planning and project management firm in the world. The stock is cheap and very attractive for a competitor looking to expand. The CDPQ has \~20% and RBC recently built a 16.6%. I understand this is a difficult stock to hold or even buy. It’s not supposed to be easy. I believe SNC will eventually emerged a better company.

t3_cn57i5,Long Thesis. CARE Ratings Ltd NSE:CARERATINGS,"Note: 1 lakh = 10\^5 and 1 crores = 10\^7. FY17 = 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017

*This was written on Tuesday so the PE multiple might be a bit off.*

CARE Ratings is India's second largest credit ratings agency. It is the second player in an oligopolistic market, with high barriers to entry. At 11x trailing EPS this seems like the perfect place to buy a great business at a decent price.

THE BUSINESS

CARE's core business is exactly the same as credit rating agencies across the world. They rate corporate bonds and bank debt of companies that are borrowing money. CARE gets paid a % of the bank loans/ bonds by the company that wants to borrow money. After the company borrows money, the rating process is not over. CARE has to rate the debt of the company as long as it has debt outstanding (which the company has to pay for). This process is required by SEBI and so CARE gets a steady recurring revenue stream as long as the company has debt outstanding.

WHY THE STOCK IS CHEAP

In September of 2018 India's largest transport finance company's subsidiaries defaulted on its bank loans (IL&FS default). This triggered a review in 2018 by SEBI (India's market regulator) about the processes of credit rating agencies. CARE and ICRA (Moody's subsidiary in India) had both rated IL&FS AAA till it defaulted on its debt. CARE stock has fallen \~62% from its 52 wk high of 1395. To add to the problems of the company an anonymous complaint was received by SEBI that the senior management took bribes to give better ratings to IL&FS. The CFO resigned recently with no explanation given. This has had investors spooked about the future of the company. The company reported weak Q1 numbers, and the price fell 36% (as of  6 Aug). The Q1 numbers are

The company is currently facing short term headwinds (weak corporate borrowing, regulatory scrutiny leading to CEO fired, CFO resigning) and so Mr. Market has marked down the price of the company. There is unwarranted negative sentiment about the company.

THE THESIS

1.You don't need smart management to run the business.

CARE's business is a toll booth into the debt markets and for borrowing from banks. All management has to do is: A. Rate companies B. Return cash to shareholders. CARE's management has understood B very well and has had a payout ratio of 65%. On the point of A, I feel that after the IL&FS scandal, the increased regulatory scrutiny has led the ratings agencies to be more conservative in their ratings, and this is a plus in the long term. Even if SEBI bans Rajesh Mokashi from ever running a ratings agency, they have enough depth to get new management. And in the end management doesn't matter that much in this business. (Proverbial idiot being able to run a business)

2.The impact of regulatory scrutiny is over-emphasized

The main concern of the bears is that: SEBI will ban CARE from rating companies like they did with Deloitte for auditing. This seems unlikely. The main complaint SEBI has with CARE seems to be that they revised their ratings extremely quickly just before the default. From a recent new article: “Despite four changes to ratings rules in the last three years for improving transparency and processes, agencies still make abrupt, multi-level downgrades from top ratings to junk, rattling the market. A case in point is the sudden downgrade of bonds sold by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) and related entities after they defaulted on payment obligations in September.” source: [https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/sebi-rbi-examining-business-models-of-rating-agencies-1558030782374.html](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/sebi-rbi-examining-business-models-of-rating-agencies-1558030782374.html)

The most likely things seem to be: 1. SEBI requires that the ratings agencies keep the ratings committee separate from management. 2. They have a probability of default on the rating.

Neither of these damage the earnings/cashflows of the company. In the long run in my opinion, these rules should improve the quality of ratings, and so reduce future regulatory scrutiny is reduced.

3.The business is still a high return on capital business

Excluding cash and ST investments, PreTax ROC (EBIT/ (Assets- NIBCL)) has been between 42% and 30%. Even if you assume that they cut prices (after all they will get stares from regulators for increasing prices just after the crisis), and if they have lower margins as a result of this, EBIT margins  could go down to 30% if the price per rupee of debt rated goes down even 10%. This business has high operating leverage and this means that if in the future, they are able to increase the price per rupee of debt rated by 10%, then margins will go up very quickly. Either way RoC should remain in the downside 20%, and in the upside 40%. The company will sustainably earn in excess of its cost of capital even in the most poor environment,

4. The market is forgetting that the business has an extremely long runway to grow

The corporate bond market in India is expected to double by 2023. This means that if and when the economy picks up then CARE should see revenue growth in the mid-teens and the operating leverage along with it. This increases the top possible margin to 60% EBIT like it was in FY16 and FY17. High ROC + Long growth = Great Business to own for the long term

5. The company has a target on its back and is stuffing the income statement with every expense they can find.

Employee expenses are up 16% YoY and “Other expenses” are up 24% YoY. My (unproven) hypothesis is that the company is trying to send a message to regulators that they aren't making too much money and so shouldn't be fined as harshly.

IS THE COMPANY A FRAUD?

I don't think the company is a fraud despite the CFO resignation. It does sound suspicious and does warrant further investigation. My personal hypothesis is that the CFO knew that the company would come under investigation and didn't want his name tarnished. But as I showed earlier, you don't need a Jack Welch-like person to run this business. You just need someone who rates bonds and pays out dividends.

VALUATION

Comps trade at 25x ttm EPS and CARE trades at 11x ttm EPS. The market should recognize this discount when the cloud over the business from SEBI scrutiny and the slowing economy goes away. Another way of approaching this is that the company needs close to zero capex in excess of depreciation. From FY15 to FY19 Net PPE increased by only 1722 lakhs (1 lakh = 10\^5 rupees) while EBIT increased by 1686 lakh rupees. Almost all of the net income can be treated as FCF. This means that (although we haven't got the FY19 CF statement), FCF for FY2019 will be in the range of net income. If FCF is 10767 lakhs, market cap is 147400 lakhs, the company trades in the range of 13x FCF. This implies a 7.6% FCF yield + a growing stream of cashflows. This is clearly cheap and has a long way to go.

Bear Case

Net Income stays constant forever and regulators fine the company 10% of revenues. This leads to a 1 time drop in earnings. The company is valued without growth at a 14x FCF multiple. This implies an upside of 7%.

Base Case

Revenues grow at 6% (GDP level)

Net Margin stabilizes to 30% so FY 21 Net income is 10143 lakhs. This should be valued at a multiple of 25x (as a net margin of 30% implies a RoC in the high teens/low twenties which warrants such a high multiple). This means that a market cap of 25 billion rupees in 2021. That means that investors today will get a 33% annualized return. The regulators don't fine the company

Bull Case

The economy picks up and grows at 8% (The RBI target). The RBI reduces regulation on corporate bond markets and they go to developed market levels. CARE would have 15% revenue growth and extremely high margins implying a 50% upside when operating leverage kicks in. If valued at 30x earnings (justified due to the 30%+ ROC that the company will have in the case), investors should see a 50%+ annualized return for the next few years",9,0.85,1565181256,"[['CARE', 11], ['FCF', 4], ['B', 1], ['ST', 1], ['CF', 1]]",CARE,18.979999542236328,19.270000457763672

""Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores and are accounted for in the period in which the amount of percentage rentals can be accurately estimated.""

Then they provided a table showing future minimum annual rentals over the next 5+ years. Are these projections of the percentage rentals to be paid over the next 5+ years based on future sales or are they recognizing the percentage rental payments for current and prior year sales over the 5+ year window? 

The amounts are almost as large as the projected operating lease payments, which seems high. I would have thought the percentage rent based on sales would be small in comparison to the overall lease payment.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eqt-corp-rice-proxy/rice-group-wins-board-control-at-gas-producer-eqt-new-ceo-to-be-named-idUSKCN1U51Q5

And they think a lot of costs can be taken out of EQT, so that seems like good news for EQM, as that means probably more production growth. 

Debt is managable at 3.5-4x EBITDA and they are forecast to earn $900 to $950 million on a market cap of $6.2 billion.

They are building a new pipeline which is 85% complete (and they get some income from it already) which had issues with environmentalists and cost overruns. This is expected to be finished somewhere in 2020 and add about 30% to EBITDA.

But overall with the deep level of gas inventory and likely modest production growth in the area, this is a very cheap stock. Meanwhile you get over 14% of your money back within a year.

There is the risk of lower rates, but that is mitigated IMO, as EQT owns almost 20% of EQM and pipelines are hard to build due to environmentalists. They are not exactly a commodity in most areas, which gives pipeline companies generally a decent amount of leverage.

t3_csmlyq,Cyclerion Therapeutics: Application to Value Investors Club,"I applied to the Value Investors Club with the below please let me know your thoughts.

# Why it’s interesting

The three reasons I think this is an interesting idea are that Cyclerion comes from a spinoff which **initially looks ugly to the parent company’s investor base** leading to a sell off, that **most of the top executives and founders of Ironwood chose to work at the smaller no revenue producing Cyclerion** with some even buying shares of the company in the open market making it appear to be an attractive place to build equity and that **there is a potentially very near term catalyst resulting between September and December**.

# The spinoff

In the 10-12B, Ironwood states:

*The strategic objectives of the separation are to unlock value, enhance operational performance and strategic flexibility and tailor the capital structures to best serve these distinct businesses.*

* *Going forward,* ***Ironwood intends to focus primarily on programs targeting treatments for GI diseases and abdominal pain****. Ironwood's assets are expected to continue to include its flagship product linaclotide, which is available in the United States and over 30 countries worldwide for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, or chronic idiopathic constipation under the brand names LINZESS® and CONSTELLA® (linaclotide). In addition to commercializing linaclotide, the company also intends to develop and commercialize (if approved) its core pipeline candidates, IW-3718, a Phase 3 program being developed for the potential treatment of persistent gastroesophageal disease, and MD-7246 (formerly linaclotide delayed release), which is being evaluated for the treatment of abdominal pain associated with all forms of IBS. All of Ironwood's current linaclotide collaborations will remain with Ironwood.*
* *The new company, which has been named Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc., or* ***Cyclerion****,* ***expects to leverage its pioneering work in cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or cGMP, and sGC pharmacology*** ***to advance an innovative pipeline of five distinct programs*** *focused on the treatment of serious and orphan diseases.*

*At launch, Cyclerion's portfolio will comprise five differentiated sGC stimulator programs:*

* *olinciguat, currently in a Phase 2 trial as an oral, once-daily vascular sGC stimulator for patients suffering from sickle cell disease;*
* *praliciguat, in two separate Phase 2 trials as an oral, once-daily systemic sGC stimulator for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, and for diabetic nephropathy, respectively;* 
* *IW-6463, a central nervous system-penetrant oral sGC stimulator, is currently in a Phase 1 first-in-human study and is designed to treat serious and orphan neurodegenerative diseases; and* 
* *two organ-targeted programs to address serious and orphan diseases of the liver and lung, respectively.*

The spinoff Cyclerion is initially ugly looking because it comprises of 5 products that are only in clinical trials or discovery phases and seems extremely difficult to value. I originally almost stopped looking when I learned that Cyclerion is a company with products only in a testing phase. I believe if you had bought Ironwood prior to the spinoff your thesis was about the LINZESS® product and the Gastrointestinal Disease market. The separation of Cyclerion looks like a lottery ticket about sGC stimulators which as an investor you likely have no idea about and not enough time to become an expert. **Why risk your capital on the results of trials?** You may as well sell now with the guarantee of value and only keep the shares of profitable Ironwood.

On April 2nd Cylerion officially started trading as CYCN opening at around $20 a share with a market cap of around 550 million and closed at $14.50. CYCN never got to $20 again. Today CYCN is at $8.85. Ironwood at that time had a market cap of around $2 billion. I believe the drop in price occurred because of how ugly and different it appeared to Ironwood investors and encouraged them to get cash today.

# So actually though why risk your capital on this?

At this point it seems to make sense as an Ironwood investor why you would sell this. I almost gave up on this ugly duckling that appears as a lottery ticket, but then I asked what do insiders think? My discovery was that they clearly think this is a very attractive opportunity. Almost all top executives and founders have left Ironwood for Cyclerion. They left a company with a profitable product for one that will be defined by testing results. They must feel pretty good about what the outcomes will be. 

# The team that left Ironwood

1. **Mark Currie, PhD - President and Chief Scientific Officer**   
Mark is the primary inventor of LINZESS®, a market‑leading treatment for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. Mark led R&D at Ironwood and was the Chief Scientific Officer. Prior to Ironwood, Mark led the discovery group at Sepracor and discovery pharmacology at Monsanto/Searle, which produced several important medicines, including LUNESTA® and CELEBREX®.
2. **Peter Hecht, PhD - Chief Executive Officer**  
Peter served as co-founder, chief executive officer and director of Ironwood from 1998 to 2019. During his tenure, Ironwood grew from nine PhD scientists to a commercial biotechnology company that discovered, developed and is now commercializing LINZESS® – the branded prescription market leader in its class.
3. **William Huyett - Chief Financial Officer**  
William served as Chief Operating Officer of Ironwood. William Huyett, has extensive experience in pharmaceutical and medical device corporate strategy, capital allocation, finance, product development and commercialization, and corporate leadership gained during his 30‑year career at McKinsey and Company, Inc. 
4. **Brian Cali, PhD - Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications**  
Brian co‑founded Ironwood Pharmaceuticals in 1998. From then until joining Cyclerion in 2019, he served in various enterprise leadership roles, including responsibility for discovery and early development activities, program leadership and portfolio management, R&D strategy, assessment and in-licensing of external innovations, and corporate communications and investor relations.
5. **Christopher Wright, MD, PhD - Chief Medical Officer**  
Christopher led the global development organization at Ironwood, including responsibility for advancing the late‑stage and life‑cycle gastrointestinal programs. He has two decades of medical research and drug development experience in orphan and specialty diseases, including cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy and dementia. While at Vertex, Chris oversaw the development of ORKAMBI® through Phase 3, and the successful development and rapid approval of KALYDECO®, a life‑changing cystic fibrosis therapy, by the FDA, EMA and other health authorities. He also played an important role in the global development and approval of INCIVEK® for hepatitis C.

# What's at stake for the team?

We have established that this past successful team has left a company with guaranteed revenues for one in trial phases. What other ways can we quantify how valuable this team thinks the equity will be? Let’s see how they get paid first.

Any unvested stock options and restricted stock units in Ironwood will be substituted to Cyclerion options or Cyclerion restricted stock options. According to the 10-12B this was the salaries of some of the executives in 2018:

Peter M. Hecht, Ph.D $100,000 salary with option awards of $3,842,268  
Mark G. Currie, Ph.D. $485,000 salary with option awards of $1,424,289  
William Huyett $465,000 salary with option awards of $2,346,469

As we can see most of their salaries at Ironwood were in options which they decided to convert to Cyclerion options. There is another item in executive compensation stating:

*“Since co-founding Ironwood in 1998, Dr. Hecht has declined cash bonuses each year. Recognizing that Dr. Hecht's cash compensation is well below his market peers, the Ironwood Compensation and HR Committee granted Dr. Hecht stock options, in lieu of an increase to base salary and cash bonus, to keep his overall compensation competitive with that of his peers.”*

Clearly Dr. Hecht’s net worth is heavily tied to the equity and has opted for it to be related to equity. He has decided that a lot of his net worth should be in Cyclerion over Ironwood. He must be fairly confident. 

At this point the team seems convinced, but one of them goes even further to show his conviction in addition certain board members also show conviction. Chief Scientific Officer Mark Currie on April 2nd buys 270,107 shares at $14.81 on the open market totaling around a $4 million purchase of his own money. He was the inventor of LINZESS® the revenue producing product at Ironwood. He is the Chief Scientific Officer his team created the sGC platform that Cyclerion is based on. He must be incredibly confident by the prospect of the sGC platform as compared to his prior invention at Ironwood. Two board members who are partners at Polaris Partners bought in total 626,117 shares at $16 on April 8th for around $10 million on behalf of Polaris. It does say this purchase was acquired from unaffiliated stockholders in a negotiated, private transaction.

# How do we value this

I could do a lot of guesswork at what the likelihood of passing phase 2 or what revenue they will derive from each product, but whatever I come up with it will be a lot of guesswork that I think is meaningless to try and derive a price per share through that analysis. I am in this because the team has decided their future time and net worth is better placed in a company that from an outsider perspective seems much riskier than the parent. They must feel very confident that this has an attractive future. 

I do have a price where I feel the stock could go based on the teams actions. Most of the options exercise prices are in the teens. Additionally, Mark bought around $15 and the board members at $16. Given that its a biotech company, I feel they must expect their returns to at least double. So I will give a range of $26 - $32 a share expected this year or 2020. It is currently at $8.85.

# Client Opportunity Size

Diseases they are targeting:

1. **Sickle Cell Disease** \- is a destructive disease with lifelong complications and debilitating symptoms.  
**Market Size:** Affects approximately 100,000 patients in the US. Globally, affects an average of 300,000 children born annually.
2. **Diabetic nephropathy** \- is a serious and progressive complication of diabetes that leads to chronic loss of kidney function.  
**Market size:** 160 million patients with diabetes have Diabetic Nephropathy.
3. **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction** \- Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing global epidemic with no approved therapies. HFpEF often leads to impaired daily functioning, low exercise tolerance and frequent hospitalizations.

**Market size:** Heart failure remains a rising global epidemic with an estimated prevalence of approximately 38 million individuals globally. HFpEF comprises 44% to 72% of new heart failure diagnoses. Heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in Medicare patients and represents approximately one million discharges per year.

Between 1987 and 2001, the average prevalence of HFpEF hospitalizations increased from 38% to 54%. Admitted patients with HFpEF have a 50% chance of re-hospitalization for heart failure within six months. Mortality rates over five years for patients diagnosed with HFpEF have been reported to range from 55% to 74%.

# The Catalysts

The exciting part about this is some catalysts will come very soon. Here they are:

1. Two praliciguat Phase 2 studies for diabetic nephropathy and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) on track for data readouts in Q4 2019 
2. Phase 2 study of olinciguat in sickle cell disease on track for data readout in mid-2020
3. Webcast investor event focused on praliciguat cardiometabolic programs to be held on September 17 in New York City ahead of anticipated clinical results.

I think this stock will run up on September 17th and after from the investor presentation and then will go up significantly on the phase 2 results. I will sell a good portion of my stake then if that happens, but hold some for the sickle cell results since the Cyclerion website seems to market that segment the most as if that's the most valuable part of this company. If phase 2 for Pracliguat does not go well, I will still hold for the Sickle Cell results as I feel there must be a reason management feels so good about Cyclerion’s prospects.",5,0.78,1566245448,"[['CYCN', 3], ['HR', 1]]",CYCN,8.430000305175781,10.289999961853027

*Edit 1: I messed up by not including the subscription revenue. That makes this analysis flawed, and keep this in mind while reading this.*

*All financials are in EUR unless otherwise stated*

**Ferrari not only sells cars; but an experience – a power rush to those who want the feeling of wealth and exclusivity**. The company is at an inflection point where it scales up growth in Asia and investors have to decide whether this will come at the expense of exclusivity. Investors buying/holding today will have mediocre returns going on.

Ferrari is an Italian luxury car manufacturer which is one of the most iconic brands in the world. The company was founded in 1929 by Enzo Ferrari, to race Alpha Romeos . The company started to make its own cars in 1947, and Fiat bought 50% of of in 1969 which was increased to 90% in 1988. In 2014 Fiat Chrysler decided to demerge it from the parent and the stock has had a great run since then.

**The Business**

Ferrari’s business model is to manufacture extremely high quality cars and sell them for a premium price to the super rich. This business model allows Ferrari to have high margins, (52% gross vs industry average of 18.5%)\* and returns on capital (18% vs industry average of 5%)\*. Ferrari spends less than .5% of sales on net capex (which is far lower than the industry average of 3.3%.)\* It is safe to say that Ferrari, is an outlier in a value-destroying industry.

\*Source: Damodaran Online

The company’s large profitability can be attributed to the fact that it sells cars to an extremely exclusive club of people, and charges them an extremely high price for being part of it. The company has been helped by the tailwinds of the growth of the Chinese super-rich and a strong global economy. Buying a Ferrari is not just buying a car, but gaining entry to an exclusive club of the super-rich. **Ferrari not only sells cars; but an experience – a power rush to those who want the feeling of wealth and exclusivity.** This exclusivity allows it to exploit the envy tendency of humans, and charge a price far beyond your average car manufacturer. The company sold cars for €278,000 in 2010, and prices per car have increased every year since then. The CAGR in price per car has been 3.6% a year indicating the strong pricing power of Ferrari.

In all of 2018, the company sold just 9251 cars for an (unshockingly high) average selling price of €370,000 (US$ 411,000). The company did \~€3.42 billion in sales and made \~€826 million in EBIT which implies an EBIT margin of 24%. They sold 2671 cars in Q2 2019, at an average selling price of €362,000. 10 years after the financial crisis, with asset prices at all time highs, the super-rich seem to have had enough money to buy Ferrari cars for the past 10 years. If you have a billion dollars, and your investments go up to 3 billion, then you get a psychological boost from the increase in wealth and spend even more. This wealth effect along with the rise of the Chinese super-rich has led to a massive increase in the number of buyers who want a Ferrari. But all dreams don’t come true. According to[ carbuyer ](https://www.carbuyer.com.sg/pay-s1-216-million-and-wait-two-years-for-ferraris-ultimate-v8-coupe/)the average waiting time in Singapore (the same city where Crazy Rich Asians was set) was 6 months for old models and 2 years for new models. Ferrari does this to maintain its exclusivity.

Now where does all this get us? Ferrari is a luxury goods company with strong pricing power, low reinvestment needs and an exclusive client base. The exclusive client base implies that Ferrari is unlikely to (or even impossible to) have large increases in revenues in the developed countries, leaving us to value it as a company whose past was in the US but whose future is in Asia.

Given this discussion, we can agree on one thing: **The defining question is whether Ferrari can maintain exclusivity and grow?**

In Europe and Africa there were 4970000 HNW\*\* individuals. 3901 Ferrari’s were sold there in 2018. So 0.078% of HNW\*\* individuals in Europe and Africa bought a Ferrari. (This is imperfect, I know. But still it will do fine for estimating the Asia TAM). In the same way 0.04% of HNWs\*\* in Middle East bought a Ferrari. In Asia that number was 0.033% for 2018 and 0.029% in 2017\*\*. In other words **Ferrari is less than half as penetrated in Asia than Europe. It is far more exclusive in Asia than Europe.** The bear case for the stock is that they will dilute the brand while scaling up in Asia. This is far from true. **Ferrari can increase Asian sales by 80% and still not reach the penetration level seen in Europe**. We have answered the question in the previous question, and so will move on to the next one: **How much can they grow**?

\*\**Source : World Wealth Report*, *Ferrari 20-Fs and author’s calculations*

The answer is obvious. Given the discussion in the previous paragraphs, the answer is to sell more cars in Asia and have the penetration levels move to that of Europe/North America. This will mean an 800 to 1000 car jump depending on how much penetration goes to. If 0.05% (which is the global average of HNWs who purchased a Ferrari in 2018) of Asian HNWs (keeping HNW numbers constant) buy a Ferrari in 2020, then the company will have a 800 car boost. If it goes to European style penetration levels (0.07%) then 2700 more cars will be sold. Ferrari is obviously taking time to do this. They need time to find the right dealers and supply the cars to China and APAC. This will take some moderate capital investment, but the efforts will be worth it.

Most investors aren’t thinking of the TAM in this way. All the Seeking Alpha posts and the one Value Investor’s Club post have no estimate of the TAM in Asia. Several investors on SA and VIC have expressed skepticism that the company can go beyond the 9k unit or 10k unit mark. But as I showed before, **that wouldn’t eliminate the exclusivity by any means because the company sells comparatively very little in Asia.** Moreover the 10k unit mark is just a psychological barrier.

The next question is:**How much should you pay for this ?**

TTM 9560 units were sold. Lets assume that they grow 4% annually. The average selling price increases in our model at historical norms at 3.6%. Revenues are €5.13 bn in 2022 (in line with management’s estimate of \~€5bn in 2022.) Assuming at 25% EBIT estimate and a 23% tax rate, then NOPAT will be €.98bn or roughly €1 bn. This company deserves a premium multiple. (The standard I use for assigning multiples to companies is from Askeladden Capital’s website. See the “How do you approach valuation” section of: [this](http://www.askeladdencapital.com/about-contact/). In case you are too lazy to click I’ll paste the relevant part on Appendix 1.)

Given that they will have strong barriers to entry and meaningful potential for earnings growth, I think it should get a 20x EV/NOPAT multiple.

This translates to €19.77 billion to €20 bn in EV in 2022. Today’s EV is €27.94b. **If you bought the stock and held it till 2022, you will have got a -6.7% (read: minus 6.7%) annualized rate of return. Who wants that?**

Even with aggressive growth assumptions and a multiple at the high end of the spectrum, RACE will deliver negative returns to investors.

**Conclusion**

I agree with the bulls on every aspect except valuation. Ferrari is a great company with a great brand name, strong growth potential and pricing power. But at current prices, you will face mediocre returns.

**Appendix 1** (taken from Askeladden Capital’s website at [http://www.askeladdencapital.com/about-contact/](http://www.askeladdencapital.com/about-contact/)):

Assuming a debt-free company, this then equates to the following valuation rules of thumb: 

Undifferentiated company (GDP-like 2% growth): \~12- 13x EV/NOPAT

Company with modest growth prospects. (somewhat GDP-plus growth, say 3%): \~14 – 15x EV/NOPAT. (KFY was in this bucket.)

High-quality company with solid growth prospects. (meaningfully GDP-plus growth in earnings, say 4%): \~16 – 18x EV/NOPAT.

Very high-quality company with strong growth prospects. (5%+ growth): \~20x EV/NOPAT, or potentially even higher. (FC and ANSS are in this bucket.)

The business had a decent ROIC of 17.4% last year (16% in 2017), much lower than the ROE figure of 37% due to high long-term borrowings of £6.8bn (yielding a D:E ratio of 1.1), although it’s worth calling out that the majority, £5.4bn, of the borrowings is in the form of leases on aircraft.


*Where am I going with this?*


This came up on a screen I made of UK companies with high ROIC and low PE ratios. It seems on the face of it like a decent business. Plus, given its size, there should be enough analysts following this for it to be priced vaguely correctly. However, of the top 10 airline companies globally- IAG has a price to earnings ratio (2.6) of roughly half the next lowest, Lufthansa (4.91). Admittedly, it comes 7th when ranking on price to sales ratio, maybe suggesting the market expects future profits to dip much more severely than other companies.


Margin of Safety price: If the business were to grow profits at 10% per year for 10 years, with a 15% cost of capital, and assuming a future PE ratio of the median of the 10 companies, at 9.2, the business is 46% undervalued today.


Owner Earnings: starting with the £2.62bn of reported earnings and adding back on £1.11bn of depreciation & amortisation, then subtracting my £2.55bn estimate for maintenance Capex (this year’s aircraft lease agreements + the line billed as ‘engineering and other aircraft costs) and reducing working capital by £58 million as per the financial statement. This gives me owner earnings of £1.16bn and a ten-cap price of £11.6bn, 40% above today’s price of £8.29bn.

Clearly the above is a quick, initial valuation and doesn't look into the attitude from managers to shareholders, insider buying, or any comment on whether IAG can maintain its current market position, all of which I'd want to include in a more detailed analysis, but I thought I'd share to get thoughts from others and start a discussion.",5,1.0,1567552770,"[['IAG', 3], ['ROIC', 2]]",IAG,3.759999990463257,3.5299999713897705

I'm thinking about a valuation for a private business. I did the DCF, but I also want to apply the exit multiple method to ensure things are lining up. There is a more relevant comp set, mainly of public companies that have been taken private, that I can use after applying a private company discount factor. As the exit valuation is based on Year 6 numbers, I see two approaches:

\- Option 1: Take the exit multiple of that year's results and discount it back to PV at the discount rate, or

\- Option 2: Use a lower (but somewhat less appropriate) exit multiple to reflect the additional duration risk, and discount that back to PV at the discount rate

I think that there is a more theoretical question here is: **does the discount rate reflect the economic, industry, and company-specific risks only, or does it also reflect long-term risks of multiple compression/pricing?**",17,0.92,1567512186,"[['PV', 2]]",,,

I am a CPA by trade and work in M&A for a F500. I found the content in chapter 12 on per share earnings  highly interesting. However, I was wondering if there were some limitations to his arguments in the book

Edit number 1: thanks for feedback folks. I understand this book is about value investing and my examples are mainly focused on growth. I’ve edited and bolded my post to make it more clear that intended this to be a discussion of the metrics used to determine intrinsic value from future cash flow, not growth vs value. For instance: 

**1) BG advocates for using EPS as a measure**

> while I agree EPS is a good starting point, many companies are not EPS positive and more importantly **EPS is often a poor proxy for future cash-flow**. I wonder if this limits investments in growth companies, and those which are **value cash cows** but require a lot of upfront capital (REITs, telecoms, utilities). Should the enterprising investor use additional metrics to  value companies depending on the industry or stock? Such as FFO for REITs, EBITDA - capex for telecom, etc. 

**2) BG advocates for using GAAP earnings over “adjusted” or non-GAAP earnings on the basis that it avoids excessive add-backs of “one-time” (but truly recurring) adjustments.**

> while I agree that adjustments can often be “recurring” my basic criticism with solely relying on GAAP earnings is that an investor may undervalue an opportunity because of a clearly non-routine or non-cash charge, such as tax reform in the US that lead to many corporations writing of GAAP deferred tax assets, despite the fact that taxes would decrease going forwards. Additionally, using GAAP EPS May include non-recurring and non-cash gains for a company that is selling off or carving out entities or businesses, which is hardly a sustainable business and **using this measure on a value stock could result in overvaluation.** I would suggest a better approach for an enterprising investor would be to judge the individual adjustments and determine himself if appropriate. 

**3) instead of using adjusted earnings, BG advocates using an average of several years earnings, on the basis that the non-routine charges should level out (a precursor to CAPE if you will)**

> while I agree this can be useful for cyclical stocks or stable stocks, I wonder if taking an average of historical results undervalues growth, which may be demonstrated year over year, and growth can be better vetted by using adjusted earnings. For example, it would be more appropriate to use the LTM earnings when looking at FB than the average of the last 5 years, due to the growth of the company and online advertising.

t3_czsqa4,CBL Preferred E,"On Monday, August 26th before the market opens CBL Properties a REIT owning malls files a 13D. The 13D is filed by Michael Ashner who recently acquired around 6% of CBL common shares.

Ashner has been on Pershing's board with Ackman and has affiliations with many big-name activists. 

From what I found every public REIT he has been involved with he liquidates. 

He liquidated:

1. Burnham Pacific Properties Inc.

2. Shelbourne Properties II Inc

3. Winthrop REIT

4. New York REIT

In the reason for purchase he states:

“The Reporting Persons anticipate having discussions with management and the Board of the Issuer on a constructive basis relating to the Issuer’s underperformance, overall business strategy, board composition (which include reconstitution of the Board), corporate governance, management accountability, capital allocation, capital structure and the evaluation of strategic alternatives.”

I believe Ashner will get on the board with the strategic alternative to liquidate. In order for CBL to give a cash distribution to the common shareholders in liquidation, CBL has to redeem preferred shares first. 

CBL.PD and CBL.PE are redeemable at $25. They are both attractive and don't have many differences in the prospectus. The yield is currently a little bit higher in the D, but the price is higher than the E which is why I chose the E with how soon these issues could get redeemed. 

The common is currently at $0.91. Ashner's cost is $0.94.

CBL's Total NOI for the 1st half of 2019 is $293,953,000 annualized that is $587,906,000. 

As of June 30th, CBL has a total share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt of $4,416,058,000 and preferred with a redeemable worth of $626,250,000 so a total of $5,042,308,000 to cover.

According to CBRE, the mean power retail cap rate is 8.45% with the C class segment (or worst class malls) having a mean at 9.86% for the 1st half of 2019. (A power center is a large 250,000 to 750,000 square ft. outdoor shopping mall that usually includes three or more ""big box"" stores).

CBRE has neighborhood/community retail at a mean of 7.48% with the C class having a mean of 9.19%. 

CBL has both property types of power and neighborhood/community

The common shares outstanding as of June is 173,473,000.

The common shares are around zero in value at an 11.65% cap. $587,906,000/0.1165 = $5,046,403.43 minus the amount to cover $5,042,308,000 = $3,901,433.48/173,473,000 shares is around $.02

At the C class mean of 9.86%, the common shares are worth almost $5.3 a share. Valuing them at the C class level is likely unfair because as per the financial supplement for June 30th 41% of the mall NOI or 36% of total NOI (total includes office, self-storage, or smaller retail) comes from Tier 1 malls that have increased sales per square foot as compared to a year ago.

At the power retail mean of 8.45%, it's $11.04 a share.

This leaves a decent amount of breathing room for the preferred in liquidation. They would have to deviate around 320 basis points from the retail mean and 179 basis points from the C class mean.

The preferreds even have more breathing room than that though because mortgage debt is on the asset level. This means that as long as the best assets cover the credit line plus senior notes which have a total balance of $2,230,244,000 as of June 30th and the best properties individuals mortgages then the preferred will be paid. The others they can default on and the balance will not have to be paid by preferred or common holders. Many properties have no mortgage debt. 

One strange thing in Ashner's 13D is that from the moment he initiates his position he buys shares every day the market is open beside for two days. July 10th and July 11th he pauses buying and that is where the stock reaches its highest point in his time frame of buying of around $1.20. If he thinks he can liquidate this thing at those supposed cap rates why should he care about saving around 10 - 20 cents? I don't know the answer, but the pattern makes me scared of the common because he may believe its more likely to liquidate at something like $4 or lower. 

The reason why the stock is so low is not only the sentiment on retail but the fear of CBL breaking the covenants on their very sizable debt. 

Their credit line and senior note covenants that investors are worried about are: 

1. Total debt to total assets: < 60%; 

2. Secured debt to total assets: < 40%

3. Total unencumbered assets to unsecured debt: >150% 

With the NOI declining quarter after quarter, some believe the asset values lowering will cause them to be in default soon.

I believe Ashner has done his homework and feels he either has a replacement for the credit line or CBL has enough time to sell enough properties to pay the line off.

The preferred has much less risk for the possible scenarios where he exists his position, where he is wrong on timing, where he loses a proxy fight for control and where he cannot sell at high enough prices all while having a potential return of around 260% when redeemed at $25. With the preferred E, we get paid $0.415 a quarter to wait vs the common at this moment has zero dividends.

Ashner issues a proposal to shareholders saying his estimated liquidated value on the common. The higher the better.

t3_d5frlr,Best of the Best plc,"BOTB

Best of the Best plc is an online gaming company with essentially one game- players pay around £1 for entry to guess where a football (that has been photoshopped out) should appear in a photo. A panel then also guess where the ball should be and whoever guesses closest to the judges wins the prize- mostly luxury cars, but they've expanded into some other luxury items. The shares are currently at 285p, giving a market cap of £26.7 million.


Historically, the business has operated mostly out of airports and shopping centres, however, realising that focusing on their online business provided higher margins, over the last few years they have shut all physical locations.


I believe that BOTB is significantly undervalued based on earnings potential without having to forecast more than 3 years ahead. I believe this potential is a side-effect of top-line and earnings growth being hampered by the steady closure of physical locations, combined with the lack of institutional following of the business. The average growth rate of online revenue for the past 4 years has been 30%, whereas the total business revenue rate was only 14%.


There are a handful of tailwinds and a few downsides I would call out:


Pros:


•50% of revenues, and 80% of visits come from mobile. Despite this, BOTB doesn’t have an app. They plan on introducing one, which should provide a substantial uptick in engagement of their returning customers.


•Management owns 72% of the outstanding shares. I have faith that our interests would be aligned.


•One of my worries that the business would go overboard on digital marketing given their newfound online-only business structure. Undisciplined expenditure on digital marketing would more than offset the benefits of the higher-margin online activity. In the strategic report however, cost per acquisition vs. lifetime value is called out as a key business metric.


•The margin used to forecast future earnings assumes that margins stay the same as the average of the last few years. Given that the switch to online-only was done due to this segment of the business being higher margin, there is significant upside here.


•The company did a tender and bought back £3.5m of shares at 485p. Given the high management ownership of the shares, I suspect the board would have only taken this action if they felt the share price was fair value. Given only positive results since then, it's unlikely they have reduced their internal valuation for large-scale buybacks.


Cons:


•The skilled game element of the customer interaction means the business is not regulated. Regulation changes could eat into profit/revenue.


•The undiversified product mix is particularly susceptible to competitors.


Assumptions used:

•Cost of capital = 15%.

•Share buyback rate of 1% per year (in line with previous years).

•PE and PEG range calculated using share price 52 week high & low for each FY 15-19.
•After tax profit margin (vs revenue) of 10.8% used (average of 2015-19).

•3-year weighted average revenue growth rate used for PEG calculation to smooth out the denominator.


Using 2015-19 FY, the median low PE (FY earnings / 52 week low) was 9.6, compared to the median high PE of 27.4. Similarly, for PEG ratios the medians were low = 0.7, high = 1.7.



Valuation

•2019 Actuals: £14.3m online rev., earnings = £1.76m, margin = 11.9%

•2020 Projection (+30% rev): £18.59m, earnings = £2.01m, margin = 10.8%

•2021 Projection (+30% rev): £24.17m, earnings = £2.61m, margin = 10.8%

•2022 Projection (+30% rev): £31.42m, earnings = £3.39m, margin = 10.8%


Assuming a PE of 27.4, the median of the last 5 years 52 week highs and a cost of capital of 15%, the present value of the future 961p stock price would be 632p, giving more than 50% discount on today’s 285p price.


Using the 52 week lows median for the future PE prediction gives a future price of 337p or a present value of 221p.


It seems unlikely that the PE ratio would trade at the lowest end of the recent historic range, given the earnings growth rate is likely to double from 15% to 30%.",5,0.86,1568720623,"[['PEG', 3]]",PEG,60.869998931884766,62.599998474121094

Does Burry claim these stock prices are distorted since they actual security is not being purchased, it is being purchased through an index? 

*“Central banks and Basel III have more or less removed* ***price discovery*** *from the credit markets, meaning risk does not have an accurate pricing mechanism in interest rates anymore. And now passive investing has removed price discovery from the equity markets. The simple theses and the models that get people into sectors, factors, indexes, or ETFs and mutual funds mimicking those strategies -- these do not require the security-level analysis that is required for true price discovery.*

By price discovery, does Burry mean the stock's intrinsic value? 

*“Potentially making it worse will be the impossibility of unwinding the* ***derivatives*** *and naked buy/sell strategies used to help so many of these funds  pseudo-match flows and prices each and every day. This fundamental  concept is the same one that resulted in the market meltdowns in 2008.  However, I just don’t know what the timeline will be. Like most bubbles,  the longer it goes on, the worse the crash will be.”*

# SGH: Two Stories – One Truth

SMART Global Holdings, Inc. (SGH:US, “**SGH**”) relied on its subsidiary SMART Brazil for 62% of its 2018 revenue. This revenue was only possible because of a tax incentive for which SMART Brazil no longer qualifies. We show that management was not clear with investors about the grave risk Brazil posed to continued SGH profits before it happened and, even more appalling, did not adequately update investors after it happened on July 1, 2019.

SGH management still has not been clear about the severity of the adverse events in Brazil. Our extensive analysis and on-the-ground due diligence in Brazil and India reveal that SGH’s new strategy and recent acquisitions won’t replace that lost profit margin.

One recent SGH acquisition, InForce, had been owned by two SGH directors and Chairman/CEO Ajay Shah, who personally profited $5 million from the deal. Moreover, according to Indian filings that we pulled, SGH paid $12 million, or over 13x sales for this de minimis business that appears to be only accretive to insiders rather than shareholders. This related-party transaction puts a spotlight on Shah’s complete control over SGH. He is Founding Managing Partner of SGH’s controlling shareholder, Silver Lake Sumeru, which with Silver Lake owns over 40% of SGH shares. Shah also sits on one of the two boards that oversee Silver Lake Sumeru’s investment.

SGH’s short life post-IPO can be characterized by aggressive leverage, asset stripping, and cash sweeping, dumping the husk onto public markets. Crippled by the loss of the subsidy in Brazil, SGH is no longer smart money.

* SGH built its SMART Brazil business on a Brazilian subsidy for local tech, providing SGH customers tax benefits up to 28% of gross sales, allowing SGH memory to sell at a premium to international prices. Without the subsidy and with no other advantages, SGH cannot compete head-to-head in the global commodity memory market.
* In June 2019, Brazil released details of its new subsidy program. Under it, SMART Brazil can’t earn its OEM customers enough points to qualify. We have uncovered meetings and statements demonstrating that SGH knew the dire impact of this change but has not been clear about the gravity of it with shareholders.
* As a strategy re-direct, in 2018 SGH acquired Penguin Computing; it has high fixed costs and low operating margin of 6% (1Q18). This raised SGH costs and diluted its margins. In July 2019 SGH acquired Artesyn Embedded Computing and Inforce Computing. This was a step backwards, as in 2010 SGH had shut down its embedded computing subsidiary.
* The related-party Inforce acquisition turned a $12 million profit for SGH executives, with $5 million for Ajay Shah himself. SGH disclosed little about the deal. Shah is CEO/Chairman of SGH, founding partner of Silver Lake Sumeru and a member of the board that oversees Silver Lake’s investment in SGH. Silver Lake and its affiliates own 40% of SGH shares.
* SGH is practiced at murky disclosure. SGH shows KiWan Kim in California as President of SMART Brazil. But in Brazil and according to filings there, Rogério Nunes is its CEO/President. SGH doesn’t mention him in SEC filings, but we discovered Nunes has held full control over SMART Brazil since before SGH bought it 17 years ago. Omitting to disclose key-man Nunes allows SGH to conceal his compensation and any SGH share ownership/sales, or potential conflicts of interest. Nunes is director of two trade associations that lobby the Brazilian government, and he founded another that seems laser-focused on SGH interests in Brazil, sometimes against Brazilian interests.
* The failure of SGH to immediately disclose the impact on revenue of the lost subsidy, its failure to provide details of the InForce related-party deal, its concealment of key-man risk in Brazil and his failed lobbying to save the subsidy, all starkly reveal management’s indifference to good governance through their lack of clarity to shareholders.
* Silver Lake and its affiliates have already extracted much more from SGH than they invested to buy it. Since the IPO, 2017, they have sold over $270 million of stock. Meanwhile, executives have been doing the same: their $26 million of sales since the IPO compares to just one open market purchase.

t3_deyuyg,Long KHC Pitch,"I've included the crux of my pitch on KHC  below. You can find the detailed report in this [LINK](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mqjru2elfnur5ns/KHC%20Investment%20Thesis.pdf?dl=0). 

I'm using this pitch for interviews so welcome all constructive criticism. 

**Recommendation: KHC has never been about topline growth given meaningful underperformance vs. peers. Rather, we believe the company has room to support core EBITDA margins of \~27% vs. consensus at 22-23%. We see favorable risk reward in KHC (up 45% /down 20%) driven by supply chain deflation, manageable leverage, positive earnings revisions and a sizable valuation discount vs. peers.**

**Investment Thesis**

§ **Supply Chain Deflation.** KHC has seen \~$700m of EBITDA pressure over the last 18-months from supply chain inflation. These issues should start to reverse over the next 6-12 months, given freight, overtime labor, and packaging costs are deflating Y/Y.

**Relative Valuation.** KHC trades at a \~25% discount to Diversified Food peers on the back of legitimate, albeit addressable concerns. At current level, KHC trades at 10.5x consensus 2020 EBITDA vs. our implied 9.9x estimate, largely driven by the potential for positive earnings revisions. There is also scope for this story to re-rate higher (not our base case), but will be predicated on executing on the margin front. 

**Visible Path Towards Delevering.** Net leverage remains relatively high at 4.9x vs. the peer group at 3.5x. We believe leverage targets of 2.5-3x are likely not achievable in the near-term, but do see a credible path towards leverage of 3.9x by 2021, driven by \~$4.5bn of disposals (Maxwell/Ore Ida), 50% dividend cut, and cumulative FCF of $7.6bn (consensus). 

**Incremental EBITDA From Mondelez:** The 10Y license held by Mondelez for Kraft and Lunchables branded products outside of the US is expiring in 2022. We see the potential for an incremental \~$170m of EBITDA to flow to Kraft in 2022-23, which consensus estimates exclude. 

**Key Risks**

**Margin Weakness Continues.** Further deterioration of EBITDA margins given \~500bps of erosion over the last 3-years. Management has spoken of further investments (marketing/media) to ignite topline momentum. We think continued supply chain misstep and ag inflation could lead to further margin weakness in the near-term.

**Dividend Cut.** KHC cut the dividend by 40% during 4Q18 earnings to support FCF. The dividend yield stands at a whopping \~5.5% vs. peers at 3.2% and 200-300bps over its bonds. We view the possibility of a dividend cut as a credit positive and supportive of de-levering actions, given management has repeatedly noted its commitment to IG credit rating. 

**High Yield Downgrade.** Net leverage stands at an industry high of 4.9x, while plans for asset disposals are temporarily on hold. Credit rating agencies have stood behind IG ratings, although stable/negative outlooks could deteriorate into HY category. CDS spreads and term structure spreads are pricing in a downgrade to HY, but we think this is premature given a visible path to 3.8x net leverage. 

**More Goodwill Impairment.** Goodwill/intangible (\~$85bn) is still 2.3x KHC’s market cap, despite taking $16bn of impairment YTD. While it’s difficult to estimate when another impairment charge could materialize, we think another $11bn of charges is possible. However, this would be a non-cash charge, excluded from core EBITDA/EPS, and not affect credit metrics. 

**Catalysts**

**SEC Investigation.** The SEC launched an investigation into KHC citing accounting issues. The investigation is ongoing, despite voluntarily restatement of historical numbers, given supply rebate irregularities. Any resolution will likely be well received. 

**Additional Asset Sales.** Although on hold for now, KHC was considering divesting some underperforming assets. We think additional asset sales would temper credit rating downgrade expectations. 

**Unveiling Strategic Initiative.** New management is formulating a plan to drive better execution on growth, margin expansion, and strategic initiatives. As such, this announcement could come as early as February 2020 and could clear up a lot uncertainty.",12,0.72,1570535452,"[['KHC', 10], ['FCF', 1], ['HY', 1]]",KHC,26.530000686645508,27.6200008392334
t3_dgh0o4,United Natural Foods,"This is a curious name I've been kicking around lately...I'm not quite sure what to do with it yet, but thought it'd make for an interesting discussion. I'm new to this industry and this is just about a days worth, so excuse any errors. 

UNFI is a leading distributor of organic / natural foods. They are the exclusive supplier to Whole Foods under a contract expiring in 2025. Whole Foods historically was about 1/3rd of the Company's revenue prior to the 2018 leveraged acquisition of Supervalu which diversified the Whole Foods exposure down to \~15%. Pro-forma for Supervalu, about 23% of sales are to independent markets, 17% to Whole Foods and Whole Foods-type retailers, 60% to conventional retailers, and the small balance to other vendors. 

Distributing organic foods used to be a pretty good business because 1) the organic foods industry has strong secular tailwinds and 2) organic foods did not fit the conventional food distribution logistics model for a variety of reasons that can somewhat be summarized as a combination of shelf life and de-centralized sourcing (farmers, local producers, etc., not traditional CPG suppliers) and as a result commanded a slight pricing premium over conventional distributors. 

The secular shift towards natural foods has been strong enough for conventional distributors to revamp their logistics and start to make inroads into the specialty market, and their large scale (Sysco, U.S. Foods, etc.) allows them to offer competitive pricing. So a race to the bottom is currently taking place. Gross margins on the organic side typically range around \~12% while more conventional is \~9%. Operating costs are mostly fixed - salaries, transportation, fuel, etc. - which is problematic particularly in low unemployment environments like today. This all comes together and gives you razor thin EBITDA margins in the LSD range.  

UNFI completed the acquisition of Supervalu in late 2018 and levered their balance sheet with $2.8 billion secured bank debt, plus another $1.3 billion operating leases capitalized at 7x. LTM EBITDA is $563 million against revenues of $21.4 billion for the same period. Net of interest, taxes, capital expenditures, and uses of working capital the Company burns free cash flow. 

Consensus estimates for the Company over the next several years call for modest cash generation, but this implies gross margin to only deteriorate by \~33bps driven by minor penetration of conventional retailers into the revenue base. 

I guess if I am starting to form a thesis in my head...that seems a little aggressive and it feels like these margins are going to continue contracting more to the \~9% I mentioned earlier. In fact, gross margins of \~10.5% will put the Company into negative EBITDA territory (!). Maybe \~11.5% is a more realistic goal post? That will get us $215 million EBITDA although the Company will still burn close to $200 million a year on that. 

Another interesting data point is the lean cash balance the Company runs with...around $40 million which is very small relative to their revenue base. Liquidity here primarily comes from availability on an asset based revolver secured by most of their inventory. If margins keep contracting, this may lead to a write-down of their inventory which makes me wonder how that may affect the ABL borrowing base calculation - it could squeeze liquidity real quick. 

As of the most recent 10-K they currently operating 63 distribution centers, and from what I understand there is a fair amount of overlap between legacy UNFI DCs and Supervalu DCs which will be consolidated. Since they own a lot of these the proceeds from consolidation will go towards debt pay down. The Company says they may get about $1 billion after they've completed selling assets...I just don't know if I believe that. I probably need to do more work on the total distribution foot print of all food distributors in the country to see if there is an overcapacity issue. If there is, they certainly won't get values high enough to total $1 billion. 

Given this context, it probably wouldn't surprise anyone to learn that their stock is trading at \~$7, down from $13 in September which is down from \~$50 in summer 2018. Their $1.8 billion term loan due 2025 trades at \~72 for a \~13.5% yield. 

I'm just not really sure what to do with this. These issues look pretty structural to me which I don't think they can reverse, so the stock is probably a short, yet I don't really see a good catalyst. 

For the same reason, I don't really want to buy the loan right now unless there is a way to force bankruptcy and preserve value. The debt is cov-lite so there aren't any maintenance covenants that can get the ball rolling here. 

One might suggest shorting the stock and going long the loan, which is a trade that doesn't necessarily disgust me, its just the catalyst issue. Asset sale cadence is probably the key here? Another issue with the loan relates to collateral, but that is a separate issue. 

I really don't know, but these are my thoughts. It'd be great to discuss if anyone else has thoughts on this or could point me in the direction of any good industry white papers on how food distribution works.",18,0.88,1570808769,"[['CPG', 1], ['UNFI', 1]]",CPG,3.799999952316284,3.9000000953674316
t3_dieqdf,I'm a total amateur and need some second opinions am I looking at a potential fraud?,"**Background:**

A friend of mine knows I'm interested in fundamental research of companies I started doing this on my own a few years ago and he mentioned that one of his good friends had told him about a Canadian mining company called CRUZ COBALT CO. it's a penny stock mining company purportedly with 7 Cobalt projects 5 in Ontario, 1 in Montana and 1 in Idaho. So I wanted to look into it as he bought it on the advice of a friend and it's headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, which from what I’ve heard is the mecca for securities fraud because in Canada, there is no federal securities regulator and the BC provincial regulator is the weakest of them all.


**Management Team**

The management team per the company's [website](https://cruzcobaltcorp.com/about/management/) consists of three men [James Nelson](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/James-Nelson-09V9WZ-E/biography/), [Seth Kay](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Seth-Kay-0B0N8D-E/biography/) and [Gregory Thomson](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Gregory-Thomson-06Z62C-E/biography/). They also list a woman named [Cindy Cai](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Cindy-Cai-094W62-E/biography/) as their CFO. Digging around I found out she is the CFO of two other small mining companies and has been the CFO for at least 11 companies since 2010 all of them in the energy or resource exploration business what a busy woman! Here are all three mining companies websites, anything look familiar? 
[Cruz Cobalt Co.](https://cruzcobaltcorp.com/) l
 [Sienna Resources Inc.](https://siennaresources.com/)
l [Spearmint Resources Inc.](https://www.spearmintresources.ca/).
 

From the shields in the top left corner to the page layout they look to be nearly copies of each other. In addition Gregory Thomson is a Director for all three and James Nelson is President, CEO, Secretary and Director for Cruz and Spearmint. 

**Company Offices**

If that isn't at all interesting click the contact us tab on each of the websites and notice they all have the exact same head office at Suite 1470, 701 West Georgia
Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V7Y 1C6. They also share a PO. Box 10112 Pacific Centre and in their annual reports it states that both Spearmint and Cruz's registered and records office are at 900 – 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 3H1. Meanwhile Sienna's registered and records office is far away at 800 – 885 West Georgia Street. All three share the same auditor Davidson and Company LLP.

**Auditor's Going Concerns**

In each of the latest annual reports the auditor expresses “material uncertainty related to going concern” essentially saying they are not sure whether each company can stay in business because “(Cruz) had a working capital of $3,063,030, had not yet achieved profitable operations and has an accumulated deficit of $15,875,374 since its inception”. Spearmint on the other hand “At January 31, 2019, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, incurred a net loss of $768,576 during the year ended January 31, 2019 and has an accumulated deficit of $3,551,251 since its inception”. Finally Sienna “had a working capital deficiency of $401,206, had not yet achieved profitable operations and has an accumulated deficit of $22,122,639 since its inception”. 

**Share Issuance**

In the past 2 years alone Cruz has issued $7,351,159 in shares, Spearmint has issued $1,671,200 and Sienna has issued $2,405,000 in shares. None of these companies seem to be doing anything other than raising more money.

**Another Red Flag**

Looking at the other companies the main players have been involved with I found out Gregory Thomson was a director of a company called Copper Road Inc. which last filed an annual report with the SEC in 2007. One of the directors who was his peer was a man named Kelly Fielder, when looking up Kelly I found this delightful [article](https://biv.com/article/2015/01/convicted-stock-promoter-still-hasnt-paid-fraud-vi)
 
**Conclusion**

I see a lot of weird relationships and questionable actions but I’m a complete noobie so I was wondering if y’all who are more experienced and sophisticated could tell me. Did I just stumble onto a potential fraud? Or is this unusual behaviour just how small companies in the mining sector behave? I would love to be wrong about this and tell my friend he did not buy a scam. All criticism or corrections are welcomed. Thanks for reading.

*""Our 5-year DCF produces a $34 PV utilizing a 26x EV / EBITDA or 7.5x EV / Revenue LTM terminal multiple on our forecast and a 10% discount rate.  Also, the DCF factors in the $120m+ worth of acquisitions conducted in 2019 YTD.  But otherwise, the Company is FCF positive given the SaaS nature of deferred revenue inflows.* 

*We utilize a public enterprise SaaS comp set of over 60 names.  Those growing topline mid-20s and above are currently trading at 10-20x 2020E EV / Revenue.  Utilizing 10x on our 2020E revenue estimate yields a $30 stock price (we are forecasting 29% y/y growth in 2020E).*

*Lastly, one could value the non-enterprise self-serve business and enterprise segment separately.  For a low growth yet highly profitable and stable self-serve business, 7-8x EV / Revenue feels appropriate (given the higher than average profitability).  For the hypergrowth enterprise segment that’s currently doubling y/y, we could utilize a 16x EV / Revenue in line with the median of high growth self-serve comparable peers (TEAM, WORK, ZM, TWLO, SMAR, DBX, ADBE).  Over time as growth decelerates, the forward multiple should be taken down.  On a consolidated basis, this implies \~10-11x consolidated EV / Revenue ($30 PV), which again is at the low end of the peer range.* 

*Lastly, the FCF support is what really attracts us as value investors.  Theoretically, if the Company were to “turn off” its S&M spend, it could produce 40% FCF margins immediately.  At normalized profitability levels for what would still be a \~10-15% topline grower, you are paying close to \~20x EV / FCF for a very high-quality asset that’s growing nearly 3x faster than the market yet at a similar, normalized valuation multiple.  At the very least, this asset deserves a premium to the market, which is what makes this a great value play too. ""*",2,0.76,1572122526,"[['FCF', 4], ['DCF', 2], ['PV', 1]]",FCF,13.84000015258789,14.539999961853027
t3_dn72ej,Scrounging the Canadian oil microcap world to find a 50+% FCF yield stock," I’ll be honest, I don’t know if there’s another catalyst for this stock except value, but at this point it’s so ridiculously cheap it’s hard to imagine it doesn’t go up in the near term. Full disclosure, I can’t buy it because I’m restricted due to my job. Also means I haven’t done enough diligence to make a decision if I were to buy it.

Hemisphere Energy is a microcap Canadian producer with waterflood assets in the middle of nowhere and it is not remotely a hot asset. However, they’ve recently tripled production with near zero declines (declines have actually been negative in the past few months). Insiders have slowly been buying, and the stock hasn’t moved in three years (admittedly outperforming the rest of Canadian energy). The company is currently messaging excess cash will be allocated to repurchases, but given the nature of management teams in the industries I will never hold my breath on that. They repurchased a pretty immaterial amount of shares in August thus far. 

FCF yields assuming $18 Canadian diffs and a 1.33x exchange rate are (FCF yield on Mkt cap, EV):

$55 – 77%, 23%

$50 – 38%, 11%

$45 – -1%, -1%

$60 – 116%, 34%

$65 – 155%, 46%

This assumes a $10 million capital program to keep production flat, although that’s very conservative considering low declines (sub 15%) and a $15 million capital program has thus far added 700bbls a day consistently. $18 WCS diffs is also pretty conservative in my mind given that WCS diffs have been much tighter with curtailments in Alberta, and Maya trading at a premium or par to WTI. I expect these to stay once pipe capacity is online in Canada with enough pipe capacity expected in mid 2020 to sustain current Canadian production with no new pipelines needed (though I do anticipate pipelines will be built in the near-mid term). 

Closest example of a transaction I know of is Cardinal Energy’s 3,000 bbl/d acquisition of waterflood assets in Midale in SE SK. The purchased them for a valuation of $400 million. They were widely criticized, but even if you take a 75% haircut to that given where stocks trade today vs 2017, and assume the actual value is $100 million, that would represent a 4 bagger.

Production expansion is low risk. Each production well only costs $800k CAD meaning you’re not spending $10 million to find out the NPV doesn’t work. There’s some risk they try to drill a ton of step out wells and it’s a disaster. I haven’t talked to management, but it would be a question for me for them.

**Risks**

\- Management’s cash flow plans. I have literally no insight into this currently. The biggest risk to me is they decide to expand somewhere else in Canada unproven (Montney or Duvernay) or try a waterflood that fails miserably elsewhere. Their assets are likely too small to be bought. 

\- Recession – the company is pretty levered. $30-$40 WTI means it’s probably a BK, but that’s true of pretty much every oil company.

\- Operational issues – The waterflood could stop working. I don’t see why it would, but it’s a possibility.",20,0.89,1572052880,"[['FCF', 1], ['SE', 1], ['NPV', 1], ['WTI', 1]]",FCF,13.529999732971191,14.369999885559082

t3_du6tgm,Long GME (Gamestop) - Feedback Appreciated :),"I’ll try to express my core points about GME – feel free to critique any of my conclusions / statements. Hopefully my analysis has provided some evidence that the mean value is around  $10-$20 per share. I'll start by explaining the progression to the mispricing of $6.09 today from a more reasonable $12-$15 earlier this year.

Gamestop hired Perella Weinburg to explore sale w/ Apollo and Sycamore as two main suitors in early 2019. Talks fell through as a vague statement - “GameStop’s Board has now terminated efforts to pursue a sale of the company due to the lack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquiror”. This implies that Gamestop got into the final talks with Sycamore or Apollo, and one of them wasn't able to perform a leveraged buyout to the degree they expected - a small misstep which resulted to where we are at today. Note this would have been anywhere from \~$15-$20 earlier this year.

A subsequent removal of their ""high yield"" dividend by the new management team (expected given their method of compensation - long-vesting options and other equity that is negatively affected by a dividend) resulted in a sharp share price drop, from $5 to a bottom of $3.21 after a tender offer with >40% proration factor. Given that Gamestop's institutional holders were full of dividend related ETF/index funds/mutual funds, this constituted a massive forced selling process, not to mention the 75% of the market cap short we have gotten to today pushing the price down (highest in the market as of October 2019).

Next, we will discuss the multitude of misconceptions that have pushed the price down and balooned the short interest

Misperception - Gamestop has a big sales problem - who shops there anymore?

Gamestop’s SG&A has been allowed to saturate above gross profit levels consistently for a full 7 year console cycle - causing operating profit compression. Since the last console release (end of 2013), Gamestop's SG&A has been allowed to bloat with corporate overhead / non-incremental expenses. Excluding double digit gross profit declines in 2017 and 2019, gamestop's gross profit has actually been flat (-1% to 5% annually).

Misperception: SSS / Preowned Declines Will Flip Margins

Gamestop’s New Management is aggressively cutting unprofitable (\~5-10%) stores, and taking advantage of the short term lease profile discussed later. SG&A & Operational Efficiencies of 200m by the end of 2020 exploited widen the operating profit margin from 12.8% to 24.3%. This is very achievable by mgmt considering they have completed 40m out of 100m guided in their first quarter (Q3) and guided up this level to 200m by the end of 2020. Late Stage in 10 year console cycle & confirmation of disk drive in both big console releases next year will stave off gross profit declines temporarily.

Misperception: Gamestop is the next Blockbuster

BlockBuster was saddled with high interest debt, maturing in 2009/2010 (900m), and were unable to refinance during the financial crisis. BlockBuster also had razor thin margins and high interest payments well before their bankruptcy in 2010. Despite aggressively cutting SG&A, store count only fell from \~9000 to \~6500, suggesting long operating lease durations prevented a more rapid scale-down.

As stated by the former Blockbuster CEO - ""With $350 million in debt that was due in the first quarter of 2009. It was something Keyes wasn’t worried about because he was planning to refinance the debt at a later date. But now, with banks unwilling to lend, and nervous movie studios changing their credit terms from 90 days to cash, Blockbuster had only one option."" Note: Gamestop instead has a net cash position!

Misperception: Radioshack is the next Blockbuster

Radioshack did not close stores with \~4300 stores in the U.S. in 2015 and in some instances 25 in a 25 mile radius (Sacramento, CA). This is due to a poor loan with strict covenants on closing stores. Extreme management issues, considering 7 CEO changes from 2005-2014 with aggressive marketing & reinventing spend for each new charlatan. 6.8 m in executive comp in 2009. SG&A stayed flat to up despite rapidly declining gross profit, no cyclical aspect of their business decline (like the console cycle with Gamestop).Indemnification Contracts removed accountability from the new management teams, and made them poor stewards of Radioshack investors' capital.

Misperception: Xbox Live / Playstation Store (Streaming) Risk

Digital Games are already a well-baked in trend, but there are structural discounts to buying physical -> resale value / unique offerings. Furthermore, multiple studies show that >60% of console gamers prefer buying physical. For example, FIFA 20 retails at $60, and FIFA 19 has a $9 value on Gamestop trade-in or $12 on eBay (structurally higher due to the time/cost requirement of packaging and shipping on the part of the seller). Since next years FIFA 21 should yield a similar trade-in value for FIFA 20, this presents a 15-20% structural discount in buying physical, and redeeming the game upon the next release.

Gamestop is wisely praying on exclusive digital items with their new management team, like the ""Fornite Merry Mint Pickaxe"" with epic rarity, requiring consumers to go to a Gamestop location and purchase a collectible (driving same store sales). This move presents a large opportunity, and has been also repeated with a ""Free Legendary Shiny Pokemon"" for Pokemon Sun and Moon and 3 free Cowboys Madden Ultimate Team players in Madden 20.

Another common statement by short investors - ""I haven't been to Gamestop in forever - they must have fallen into irrelevancy"". Nevertheless, Gamestop still holds 36.3% of console sales in the U.S. with 2.725 B out of a 7.5 B market. Although this market share is not suggestive of a moat - it is interesting to see how consumer's have still chosen Gamestop despite the long-ingested trend of Amazon & rival retailers such as Best Buy entering this near-commodity space.

Additionally, weak numbers such as a 40% drop in hardware sales seem to only lend fault to Gamestop vs. their competitors. A quick look at statistica's useful charts on PS4 and Xbox One sales show a severe freeze-up in these console sales since Dec 2018 - a similar effect to what we saw in 2013 before these consoles were released. Consumers tend to stop buying consoles once they hear a new console release is within a year in horizon - in this case Xbox Scarlett 5 - both confirmed in Holiday 2020 (also both have disc drives!!!). We've seen this rapid cyclicality before, but the market thinks it's all secular this time around.

Gamestop's management has hinted at an almost complete closure of their international stores (>1200), with direct rumors of closings in the entire Greater-Nordic region this year (\~300 stores) and further evidence in their most recent conference call. Digging into their Milan, Italy and Brisbane, Australia distribution facilities, both could fetch \~97.8 per square foot (the price Blackstone is paying on average), indicating that the sale of these facilities could provide Gamestop with another 30m in cash.

Management also seems very promising - sticking to their word in cutting SG&A aggressively as many activists have urged. They are already about 20% completed (as per conference call) of a 200m sg&a overhead cut, a seemingly routine operation for George Sherman. Digging into conference calls at his time in Advanced Auto Parts, the stock rallied almost 142% during his tenure due to a laser-focus on operating profit goals - stating that he will ""chop"" intently to meet targets.

New operating lease standards force Gamestop to put >700 m of new ""debt"" onto their balance sheet, forcing EV numbers up and causing retail / systematic selling from investors using formulas/multiples blindly. Confusion around EV seems to permeate through VIC / seeking alpha. Nevertheless, the average operating lease duration is only 2 years, and mandatory lease payments following an almost exponential distribution. The real question is should this ""debt"" with zero incremental interest payments (already included on the income statement) and a 2 year duration be treated as debt? I would disagree, especially considering the store closures we will see from management and the fact that these ""operating lease debts"" resemble accounts payable rather than long-term debt.

Additionally, most of the big/popular console games are very demanding in download size - try 92 GB for read dead redemption 2. Many consumers either don't want to wait for that mega-download on their console or simply don't have the bandwidth.

Gamestop also has a massive short squeeze opportunity. With >400 m in cash at the bottom of their working capital cycle, 75% short interest (short shares / shares outstanding), and a volatile >30% cost to borrow which peaked over 100% on interactive brokers for some periods. An existing 237m auth may be being employed as we speak, but with a meager 550m market cap, this presents a massive opportunity for management if they play their cards right. I have faith, given they already employed a dutch-auction tender offer and it aligns with their incentives to employ their buyback plan aggressively, and have already stated and acted as they will not blow away their cash.

Finally, the recent offers for Vitamin Shoppe and Chico's (two low-margin retailers with similar store profiles) both resulted in 10, 11% FCF yields per store respectively. Note: this is eerily similar to a $20 per share for GME offer that could have been fulfilled earlier this year by Sycamore / Apollo at a 11% FCF yield per store. Although the Chico's offer was turned down by management, a $20 offer today would make the stock a 3.3x today - even so the news has been relatively good this year - for example consoles were confirmed to have disk drives and come out in Holiday 2020.

I hope this provides more clarity on GME - even very conservative DCFs yield around a $7.5 per share outcome without the short-squeeze hypothesis (10% discount rate, small improvement in FCF due to console release, then 20% gross profit declines thereafer). I'm not trying to say Gamestop will make a great comeback, but a measured decline (unlike the behaviors of Radioshack's management) will be extremely accretive to the equity holders today.

Catalysts:

Share Repurchases (237 m authorization, 63 m of which was already used in a dutch-auction tender offer)

Short Squeeze (highest short interest in the market, high cost of borrowing emerging)

Buyout (Revisited by Apollo / Sycamore or some megafund alternative)

Rebound in 2020 due to the new console releases driving not only hardware but software sales

t3_dx8rdj,CCLP (Natural Gas Compression) Long (Bonds/Equity) Thesis - Feedback Appreciated :)," CCLP presents an opportunity to receive a >30% unitholder yield in mid/late 2020 onwards, whereas similar competitors USAC and AROC pay 12.4% and 6.8% distributions respectively (Although USAC is paying a distribution beyond their distributable cash flow). Once debt is paid down slightly in order to refinance, LPs should see a 2x to 3x in price per unit once a dividend is resumed / a buyback plan takes advantage of the underpriced shares in 2020.  


Market's Wonky Valuation of Compression Sector  


The demand driver for compression leasing firms is the volume of natural gas being transported through their compression infrastructure, yet the market values them according to the price of natural gas / oil. After the 2015 oil crash, the compression industry took a hit partially due to fears of counter party risk and outflows from the general U.S. energy industry. These declines in stock prices created a reflexive effect - many of these firms such as Archrock (NYSE:AROC), CSI Compressco (NYSE: CCLP), and USA Compression (NYSE:USAC) relied on the MLP model of distributing LP units in order to fund growth capital expenditures tied to acquiring more compression equipment. These firms had the incentive to try to maintain high dividends in order to support their share prices, using almost all (or even more in some cases through debt funding) of free cash flow for distributions. When share prices fell, managements took to cutting distributions - which caused the share price flywheel to spin further. Cuts in distributions immediately alienated yield-hogs chasing after MLP dividends, since Mr. Market (blind ETFs, mutual funds) like consistent, high dividend payers in this sector, which further pushed the price down.  


A quick peek highlights the affect of indexing on these compression companies - they trade in line with the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF (XES) although their cash flows do not. Since XES is tied directly to the price of oil and oil / energy sentiment, this can push the companies whose cash flows are not affected by these factors out of line (like we are seeing with the compression industry).  


The four primary compression leasing firms - AROC, USAC, Kodiak, and CCLP -- have formed an oligopoly as customers do not shop around for price on compression equipment, and customers prefer to be consistent with their leases throughout a natural gas extraction site. This results in high returns on invested capital (20% annual ROIC) tailored with a rebound in the natural gas industry, especially in CCLP's prime market in the Permian Basin.  


Compressors from AROC, USAC, and CCLP are generally leased on one year fixed fee, cash based contract, where the compressors have a meaningful delivery, setup and breakdown cost typically born by the lessor. Average compression placement time in any one location tends to be about 3-4 years, so the contracts are typically renegotiated year after year, with the compression company having the flexibility to hike the leasing fee. Thus the cash flows involved resemble medium-term infrastructure assets, rather than the more volatile cash flows of your typical oil service firm.  


Opportunity in CCLP  


CCLP currently pays the minimum distribution of a penny per unit, equating to a meager 1.74% forward dividend yield. This almost entirely alienated CCLP's shareholder base that previously enjoyed the companies yield hovering \~10% per annum. Also, Debt / Equity and other similar ratios have painted a fictitious picture of the companies financial situation, since as share price fell these ratios skyrocketed - although the equity drop was overblown.  


Previous management of the company also pushed for a non-stop, unsustainable dividend which forced them to rely solely on LP unit sales for all growth capital expenditures, and a small pull-back in natural gas volumes in 2015 and other effects above led to the flywheel explained earlier which has brought their market capitalization to almost 100m today.  


CCLP, obeying GAAP rules currently depreciates their compression infrastructure over about 12-15 years on average (Section 179 deductions bring that down into the 7 - 10 year average range). Thus, we can see that their depreciation expense is greatly overstated on their P&L, reporting 74m in depreciation LTM but with management commentary citing maintenance capex around the 20m mark. This creates a stark contrast from competitors USAC and AROC, with typical depreciation periods hovering around 20-25 years. Additionally, the over-depreciation of CCLP's equipment has led to a reduction in tax expenses, but has falsely represented the tangible book value of the company.  


Additionally, earlier this year a variable-weighted average price (VWAP) preferred share debacle was rightsized, which gave the GP (Tetra) far too much to gain and led to the firing of CCLP's CFO. These preferred shares were promptly closed out, but the >50% drop in LP unit price was preserved. The firm had also unwisely on a significant amount of leverage since 2015 to try to maintain their falling distribution, with a current EV / EBITDA ratio of 5.2x.  


""During the midpoint of our full year, adjusted EBITDA guidance of $127.5 million and after accounting for approximately $40 million of cash interest expense, $20 million of maintenance capital expenditures and $3 million of taxes. We expect to generate approximately $57 million of distributable cash flow""  
\-CFO Q3 Earnings Call  


Currently, in terms of capital allocation the management spent $30m earlier this year to redeem their preferred shares, and is guiding for <50% of that pool towards growth capital expenditures that produce a >20% ROIC. These capital expenditures and a slight rebound in natural gas volumes have been extremely accretive, with only around 26 M in distributable cash flow in 2017 to 57 M today led by a >50% increase in gross profit since 2017.  


This leaves the company with around $30m annualized net of growth capital expenditures which it currently is planning to use to pay down debt to their target 4.5x ratio. This is meaningful, as they plan to refinance their 2022 long-term debt at a lower rate, reducing interest payments. Additionally, the debt trades below par, at around 88.75 with an offering price of 98.5 presenting a large opportunity for the company to repurchase debt at an advantageous price. Thus, since debt trades significantly below par, and EBITDA is rising quickly due to increases across the sector for compression equipment, they should be able to reach their target ratio some time between Q2 2020 and Q4 2020.  


After refinancing their debt, management explained how they plan to resume distributions and possibly repurchase shares if shares stay at such a low level. We can find evidence supporting this statement due to management / GP (Tetra) having the most to gain from a dividend, since they own >30% of the common units themselves, and have been following through on their recent statements.  


If management were to redirect 30m of their distributable cash flow (not including any increases in EBITDA, which are very likely given growth capex) after refinancing to dividends at the current share price, this would effectively produce a 30% dividend yield at the current market capitalization around 100m. This is why we believe that CCLP is a 2x or 3x as Mr. Market, loving high-dividend payers, should prop the LP unit price at least to a 10-15% effective yield.

t3_e2exzm,The Bear Case on India (Part 1),"*This was written with Indians in mind, so some cultural references may not apply here*

You can see this on my blog at: [https://pradyuprasad.wordpress.com/2019/11/25/the-bear-case-on-india-part-1/](https://pradyuprasad.wordpress.com/2019/11/25/the-bear-case-on-india-part-1/)

Here's why (same text):

Some famous international investors like Prem Watsa and Mohnish Pabrai have bought into the India Growth Story (IGS). I feel that the IGS is overhyped, and projections of India becoming an economic superpower are unlikely to happen unless major policy and cultural changes are in place.

When Prime Minister Modi was elected in 2014, there were projections that he would be India’s Thatcher or Deng Xiaoping. These projections have been untrue. Economic growth in the country has slowed down with Q1 real GDP growth being at 5%, compared to 7.1% in 2018, and 8.2% in 2017. Unemployment according to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy a private sector company is 7.5% compared to 5.9% in 2018 and 5% in 2017. Worst of all, real consumption appeared to have declined by 3.7%, for the first time in 40 years according to a [leaked report](https://thewire.in/economy/consumer-sending-fall-rural-demand-nso-report) from the government.

India optimists like [Bill Gates](https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-has-potential-for-very-rapid-economic-growth-says-bill-gates/articleshow/72094025.cms) have said that the country has significant potential and can get millions out of poverty in the next few years. I disagree. I think that India is headed for stagnation of growth in the long run and the current slowdown is just the first step in it.

**The contents of the IGS:**

The history of the IGS can be traced back to a [2003 paper by Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/archive/archive-pdfs/brics-dream.pdf) and a [2000 analysis by the Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/india-rising/). It said that with the right policies, India would be a country with \~$3500 GDP per capita in 2030 and $8124/capita in 2040.

Most proponents of the IGS believe that in the next 30 years or so India will have high (>8% real economic growth), will be an economic superpower with a billion and more consumers. This amazing country will benefit from a demographic dividend, from the [10 million Indians](https://cse.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mehrotra_Parida_India_Employment_Crisis.pdf) entering the job market every year who will find jobs, spend, save and invest. Another part of this story is that there will be massive fixed investment in roads, bridges, and others which will lead to more economic growth. I will now take down the first part of the IGS: the labour myth.

**The labour myth: Jobs, people (and the lack thereof)**

It is no secret that India is having trouble creating jobs now. Over the last year unemployment has shot up to 7.5% from 5.9% a year ago. The government attempted to hide this by stopping the release of the NSSO labour survey before the elections, which was leaked to the media.

A big part of the IGS is this:

1. Indians will enter the work force
2. Get jobs
3. Spend that money.

**People? What people? It’s only men here**

Indians are not entering the workforce. In most developing countries, labour participation rates are between 60 and 80%. The 75th percentile is 67% LPR, and the median is 62%. But India is at at a low 51% (the 13th percentile) with its neighbors being Gabon and Suriname. None of the GS papers or the Brookings piece anticipated this. In a country full of young bright educated (or so they claim) youngsters over half of them stay at home and chose not to go to work.

See this photo: [https://imgur.com/a/vYPOJdS](https://imgur.com/a/vYPOJdS)

The standard objection to this is that India’s young are educating themselves.They are building human capital for their future and so this should be excused. This shall be shown to be untrue later in this post series. The lack of participation of Indians from the workforce is not equal across the genders.

**Almost 79% of males in the working age in India chose to look for a job, but only 21% of females do so.** The male participation rate is within global norms but the female labour participation rate falls laughably short. In fact the only countries which do worse than India in this are Egypt, Morocco, Somalia, Iran, Algeria, Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. It is worth noting that 3 of those countries are undergoing wars -Yemen, Syria and Iraq, 2 of them have mass protests against the government – Iran and Egypt and Somalia has a joke of a government. India is among the **worst** globally here. But why does this indicator matter? After all who cares about this number?\*

I think you should, if you care about the health of the Indian economy. If India were to have normal (\~40%) labour participation rates with average incomes ($1900) each then there would be at least an approximate 156 billion USD\*\* (6%) boost to the economy. Moreover around 80 million women are sitting at home when if we had better education, and social norms that allowed for it. You don’t have to be a radical feminist to see what a waste this is to the economy. There are 80 million women at home, not working. They would if they were born in the US, Germany or Taiwan.

**You should care because the demographic dividend may not even happen if half the country isn’t participating in it. The projected ‘dividend’ isn’t happening** **if half the country doesn’t work.**

\*If that doesn’t piss you off enough, here’s this: Pakistan beats India by 1 percent. It has a female labour participation rate of 22%.

\*\*\*\*My analysis is an ESTIMATE. This is a back of the envelope calculation. I’m not an economist.\*\*67% of India is in the working age (15-64). That is 897 million people. 48% of these are women. That is 430 million women. Only 21% of these chose to participate in the labour market. That means that there are 90 million women in the labour market today. I’m going to assume they ged paid the per capita GDP rate which is 1900 USD. Which means if these women earn the average income, they earn 171 billion USD. If more (\~40%) of women participated then we’d have 170 million women in the workforce. If they too get paid at the same pay they’d get make 327 billion USD. This is 156 billion USD more than what they are earning now. The India economy is 2.59 trillion USD. 156 billion is 6% of that. And this doesn’t count for the multiplier effect from the spending, the fact that women usually spend more on their children (when given cash transfers) which means a higher long run growth rate, and the social effects of this (lower family violence, lower birth rates).",41,0.8200000000000001,1574855024,"[['GS', 1], ['GED.AX', 1]]",GS,221.86000061035156,216.99000549316406

And McEligott explains:

The interpretation of Trump’s “better to wait until after the election” for a China trade deal comments is that the Hong Kong human rights bill sponsorship by POTUS has clearly caused agitated the Chinese side (plus this morning’s Reuters report stating that the White House is considering kicking Huawei out of the US banking system), and in conjunction with the narrowing window to act on the Dec 15th tariff “fill or kill,” **is likely incentivizing monetization of of the +9% gain made in S&P since early October via profit-taking in recently Options- ($Delta still 94th %ile since 2013 even after yday’s selloff) and Futures- (Asset Manager S&P Futures $notional position currently 99.6th %Ile since 2006 at $141.7B) positioning “extremes.”**

*This “extreme positioning” into a dynamic where traders are incentivized to monetize into year-end—especially ahead of the Dec 15th “tariff risk”—has been at the core of my view over the past few weeks that there was a local / tactical “window for a pullback” into late November (start Dec ain’t bad though).*

As such, this risk-off dynamic is driving the bid in Rates / USTs (*Reds and Greens +6 to +8 ticks, while we’ve seen Real Money and Central Bank buying flows in the front-end—thus the “bull steepening”),* which too then will almost certainly result in a reversal later today of the US Equities factor dynamic experienced on Monday (Momentum down, Value up); instead, **today’s UST rally will then dictate a resumption of the “Momentum” bounce-back experienced over the past 3 weeks, as longs in “Duration” Equities (“Min Vol” Defensives and “Secular Growth”) are set to rally, with “Cyclicals” are likely to again fall.**

Touching on my constant refrain over the past two years—that being where a “macro shock” then acts as catalyst for Dealer Gamma “flip” and / or in conjunction with a Systematic Trend deleveraging impulse—we see a mixed-bag, as our **Nomura QIS CTA model shows the majority of Equities futures positions remain “in trend” and ABOVE estimated deleveraging / “sell” levels.**

What does it tell us?

The Gamma of an option measures the rate of change of the option delta. Its' number is denoted relative to a one point move in the underlying asset. For example, if the gamma for an option shows 0.015 with a delta of 0.45 then a full point move in the stock (i.e. 35 to 36) means the delta will move to 0.465.

Gamma is calculated via an option model such as Black and Scholes or Binomial. The value is the same for both call and put options.

The Gamma of an option is important to know because the delta of an option is not constant; the delta increases and decreases as the underlying moves. Because delta is essentially our position value in the underlying, the gamma therefore tells traders how fast their position will increase or decrease in value vs movements in the underlying asset. 

In other words, Gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset. So, watching your gamma will let you know how large your delta (position risk) changes. 

**Since the chart above shows us high gamma for strike prices between 3095 and 3155 it tells us that the SP500 can get very volatile around these trading ranges. Its like playing with dynamite throwing it back and forth until it explodes.**",60,0.98,1575399498,"[['ILE', 1]]",ILE,2.0,2.0

It is a fund that purportedly has been averaging a 15% return MONTHLY for the past 18 months.  They claim that they have a proprietary algorithm for trading cryptocurrency that allows them to do this.  I am fairly familiar with crypto, and the information I was sent was just a wall of technical gibberish that I think was meant to either intimidate or impress the reader.

I’m certain enough that I am thinking about filing an SEC whistleblower complaint.  My questions are thus:

1) is there a way I can definitively look up this fund to see if it is even actually registered as a fund?  I’ve found a few sites that have search functions for hedge funds, and the name of this fund didn’t come up on any of them, but I have no way of knowing whether all funds would be included in those databases.

Searching for information about the fund is complicated by the fact that they cleverly named it in a way that google results are nearly impossible to sift through- I’m not going to name the fund, but for example imagine if they named it “Quarterly Earnings”- searching for “quarterly earnings hedge fund” is going to give 99.9% noise in the search results.  I would appreciate any info anyone has about how to search for a fund and see if it even actually exists.

1. Since the products are long-tenor, accounting is completely opaque as high acquisition costs are expended right away instead of amortizing over life. How should one see P&L profits here?
2. Sell-side is valuing this business by projecting value of new business (VNB) and giving a multiple to it - However, the VNB calculation is rather strange as it calculated as PV of cash flows of new business written that year discounted at risk free rate. It seems to me that cash flows should be discounted at cost of equity (and not risk free rate) to come to VNB. What is the right framework?
3. Life Insurance companies don't talk about ROCE, ROA - how does one say if this business is good or bad without knowing its capital efficiency?

t3_egef40,"SMSI: An under covered microcap software company, part 2.","Hi folks,

I wanted to do a very quick review of SMSI as it’s share price have dropped meaningfully since my last write-up with no fundamental change for it’s business, and I believe it now offers an extremely attractive price for a growing software business.

I covered SMSI in a recent [blog post](http://willowdalepartners.com/index.php/smith-micro-software/) prior to their Q2 earnings. At the time SMSI was trading at $3.20/share (May 25, 2019). Shortly after Q2, their stock doubled on strong earnings report but have since pulled back after Q3's earning report on no great reasons. I believe this is a once in a blue moon opportunity to buy into a robust recurring revenue generator growing at FAANG speeds (40%/yr) while at an extremely attractive price.

This will be a quick update note as a couple things have changed in favor of investors over the last few months.

**A brief Intro of SMSI:**

SMSI has 3 primary products (apps):

SafePath: an app that comes in 3 different set of functionalities. SafePath Family is a set of features that allow it to control, connect and track other phones with the app installed, primarily marketed as a family safety app, very similar to Apple’s “Where’s my phone” app, but with more features which I won’t cover here. The second and 3rd set of functionalities (SafePath IoT & SafePath Home) allows this app to control and connect to other devices like trackers, smart watches, security cams, etc. If you’ve used the Google Home app, SafePath works in a similar way (although with a different UX and more features). Between SafePath Family, Home, and IoT (all 1 app, just marketed as 3 separate feature sets) SMSI positions this app as a single device management app that allows users to connect and control smart devices they have around them (phones, trackers, cameras, TVs, etc). SMSI sells this app via partnerships with major MSO and carriers, who then resells this app as a rebranded white-label product to their own phone subscribers. I.e., SMSI partners with Sprint, who then sells this app to Sprint’s customers. Sprint charges 7/month, they split the revenue.

Commsuite: a voice to text app, but with more features but again I won’t cover those here, basically work similarly to Google Voice. Also sold via carrier & MSO partnerships to these carrier’s end customers, just like SafePath. Both Commsuite and SafePath obtains MRR as they’re subscription services like Netflix.

ViewSpot: a new app SMSI acquired last year. It allows you to configure a phone to only show specific content (a sandbox). If you’ve ever had the unfortunate experience of turning on your Windows laptop in “safe mode”, this is similar to it. This app is sold to retailers and carriers and used by these retailers and carriers as a sales agent. Carriers install this sandbox app on their display phones and tablets with pre-configured content (like the display phone’s key features, pricing, etc) primarily to help sell the display phone. SMSI receives recurring subscription revenue from their carrier customers based on the number of stores with this app installed. SMSI also receives additional ‘campaign’ revenue whenever carriers launch a new phone (i.e., IPhone 11) in their stores (think of ‘campaign’ revenue as a form of professional services).

This is a brief overview and I would encourage those interested in SMSI to understand their products in more detail. The short version is SMSI is application developer (industry: pre-packaged software) that sells it’s products to carriers to form marketing channels, these carrier partners then help them market and sell these products and they split the revenue. SMSI’s products are white-labeled for the carrier and acts as a revenue center for the carriers, while SMSI focuses on updating and building out the feature set of these products.

As I mentioned this is meant to be a quick update so I’ll skip to the more relevant things. SMSI had a blow out quarter In Q2 of 2019, finally turning massively profitable as I had anticipated and the share price doubled in the subsequent weeks.

After Q3 however, SMSI’s prices dropped by 40%. Nothing fundamentally changed for the company, but I believe this selloff was primarily due to the pending merger between Sprint and T-Mobile (more on this below). The TMUS & S merger has been in the works over the last 2 years so this shouldn’t be news, but given the state attorney’s trials it’s understandable that investors view this as a risk factor.

**Sprint & T-Mobile Merger**

This story impacts SMSI primarily because Sprint accounts for 77% of SMSI’s revenues, and following the “merger” (acquisition) T-Mobile will become the operating entity. If this looks worrisome, don’t be, much like my late grandmother’s pies, it looks much worse than it actually is.

Around the summer of 2018 SMSI’s management team begun guiding towards a pending Tier 1 carrier signing. At the same time, T-Mobile and Sprint announced their merger plans. SMSI’s management continued to guide toward this T1 carrier partner in the subsequent quarterly conference calls. It was widely expected that the T1 carrier would be T-Mobile. Our channel checks had also confirmed this would be the case.

However in Q3 2019 (prior to the stock price drop), SMSI’s management weakened their guidance to:

“It remains true that there is always risk with M&A activities, due to a variety of unknowns and things out of our control. However, we also see an equally great opportunity for growth and expansion of our business case as well.“

This was weakened from the previously guided T1 pending customer. The stock dropped in the following 3 months, worsened by end of year tax loss harvesting. I believe this drop is overblown. The weakening of SMSI’s guidance was immediately following the same time frame as the 2019 State attorney general lawsuit to block the TMUS & Sprint merger.

I believe while they’ve had to tone down their guidance on conference calls publicly, nothing fundamentally changed and they are still ramping up in anticipation of the T-Mobile signing. In fact, SMSI’s management has been on a significant hiring ramp the entire year, increasing their headcount from \~160 to \~200 as of Dec 2019. Actions speak louder than public guidance.

Separately, SMSI’s management have said that nothing have changed in regards to the T1 signing and their teams have been working with the merger teams at T-Mobile and Sprint directly. You can’t ask for much more ‘color’ than that.

**Operating Model**

The Q3 selloff is overblown and the subsequent tax loss harvesting have worsened the share price decline. I believe this is a once in a blue moon opportunity to buy extremely cheap shares of SMSI ahead of the upcoming TMUS and S merger trial conclusion. Numerous channel checks at TMUS and Sprint’s other vendors have point to a Feb – March timeline on new deal signings following the Jan 15 trial conclusion date.

SMSI is a 150M market cap business with 24M in cash, generating 5M and growing per quarter with no debt. We’re basically buying the business for 125M that generated 11M in cash this year and will generate 25M in 2020 and 41M in 2021. 2020 and 2021 earnings based on CFO guidance and assumes zero new carrier wins (not pricing in T-Mobile).

My updated model for SMSI reflects the guidance CFO Tim Huffmyer provided, which was recently reaffirmed:

**Valuation**

I think SMSI is cheap on a FCF basis (2020 P/FCF of under 6), but some prefers to relative valuations, here is SMSI against its industry peers:

**Conclusion**

I believe the recent selloff is due to the softening of TMUS & Sprint merger guidance management provided on Q3, worsened by end of year tax loss harvesting. However, management actions and channel checks reaffirm T1 signing by early next year. SMSI is extremely cheap even assuming no T1 signing with TMUS. With the likely Russell 2000 inclusion, and T1 signing in early to mid 2020, SMSI shares will likely be a multi bagger in within 12 months.

t3_ehyz0q,Q2Earth ($QPWR) - confusing and/or incomplete filing data?,"Hi, I'm hoping someone can help explain some of the confusing items in filings from Q2Earth Inc.

&#x200B;

From what I see, this started with the acquisition of GBWA in 2018. Q2Earth acquired GBWA via a Stock Purchase Agreement signed in July 2018. Earlier that year in February, Earth Property Holdings LLC (""EPH"") was filed for creation, and the company went into effect on November 9, 2018. That's the same day that Q2Earth transferred the agreement to its ""unconsolidated variable interest entity"", EPH.

&#x200B;

What does EPH do? Here's the ""Purposes of the Company"" from its initial LLC filing:

The purposes of the Company are to (i) **operate the Company and utilize its assets,** (ii) exercise all other powers necessary to or reasonably connected with the Company’s business which may be legally exercised by limited liability companies under the Act and (iii) engage in all activities necessary, customary, convenient, or incident to any of the foregoing.

That's close to the most BS I've ever heard in one sentence, but then again I haven't read nearly as many SEC filings as y'all probably have. The only reference to Q2Earth in the LLC filing is this line: ""The Company is hereby authorized to engage Q2Earth Inc. as manager""

EPH was created by an ""initial member"", and two members. The initial member is Kevin Bolin, the Chairman and CEO of Q2Earth. The two members are: one institutional investor (Foxcroft Lands, LLC), and Q2Earth. Q2Earth purchased $50K of class B ""Units"", and Foxcroft Lands LLC purchased $4.4M of class A ""Units"". I haven't been able to find shit about Foxcroft Lands LLC. Searching for the exact phrase ""Foxcroft Lands, LLC"" yields just 4 results on Google, and none of them are actually relevant.

The operating address of EPH is listed as 400 Plasters Ave NE, Atlanta. The problem with that address is that it's an office building, which other businesses operate in, and there's no Suite # listed there.

Currently, Bolin is the Chairman and CEO of Q2Earth and the President of EPH and a Class B Director of EPH. The President of Q2Earth, Christopher Nelson, is now also the secretary of EPH.

&#x200B;

Who/What is Foxcroft Lands LLC? Why did ""Foxcroft Lands LLC"" invest $4.4 million? How can that name get by on an SEC filing if the LLC doesn't exist?

&#x200B;

\-----

&#x200B;

Linking this back to Q2Earth, the Company signed an eight-year management agreement with EPH ""to oversee all of the operations of EPH and its acquired subsidiaries"" for an annual fee of $700K.

Unfortunately that won't be nearly enough to keep Q2Earth afloat, as ""$2,829,488 of our convertible bridge notes, plus accrued and capitalized interest will mature beginning in March 2020 through September 2020"". As of September 30, 2019, the Company currently has a working capital deficit of $3.94 million and has lost $878K in 2019. Their latest 10Q states my feelings pretty well: ""These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.""

&#x200B;

Another curiosity I found is that the address for Q2Earth is listed as ""420 Royal Palm Way, Suite 100"". The Bloomberg profile of Q2Earth's president (Christopher Nelson)  shows that Nelson is also a current director of GreenBlock Capital LLC. The [website](https://www.greenblockcapital.com/) for GreenBlock Capital has just one page which shows the name of the company and nothing else at all. The listed address of GreenBlock Capital LLC? 420 Royal Palm Way, Suite 100.

On top of that, [this real estate website](https://miamifl.homes/idx/mls-rx-10580222-420_royal_palm_way_100_palm_beach_fl_33480) lists the property as being available and listed on the market for 39 days.

t3_el5k67,DARE Bioscience (NASDAQ: DARE) Long Equity Pitch (0.83 per share as of 1/6/20),"Overview

Dare is a micro-cap with a market cap of only about 14 M, and is thus suitable mainly for retail investors and other small funds – the volume is also around 100-200k shares each day (and thus we believe the equity is currently treated as a penny stock trading sardine). We believe that the common equity has an attractive risk reward, with three promising late stage women’s health drugs in their pipeline along with other rights which are too early stage to dive into here. Insiders seem well-aligned to form a partnership with ownership of 14% of the company, and we believe that such a deal in 2020 will be a major catalyst for the shareholders involved. We think that the company makes a great new years resolution position (1-5% position) given a decent probability for far right-tail outcomes - based on our analysis and the 4 analysts setting price targets on average modeling out at least worth $4 a share.

DARE-BV1 (Clindamycin Phosphate 2%) -

This gel targets bacterial vaginosis (BV), a bacterial vaginal infection with about 21M cases reported annually in the US. Common symptoms include discharge that often smells like fish, and can cause serious adverse health issues if left untreated. Currently approved products have significantly lower clinical cure rates (Metrogel, 1.3% 17-37%, Clindesse 30-64%, Solosec 35-68%) compared to DARE-BV1 (88% after single dose in proof of concept study n=30 patients). We have not identified any issues with the proof of concept study endpoints or design. Patents have been granted out to 2028, with more pending into 2035.

Due to the lack of efficient therapies, many patients are simply treated with poor efficacy profile antibiotics or leave the infection to go away on its own. Its worth noting that in May 2018 Lupin (350B market cap Indian Pharmaceutical Company) launched Solosec - an oral pill for BV that only requires a single dose. Lupin estimates peak sales of $100M to $150M over the next 3-4 years, and seems like an achievable / realistic estimate given that the drug is already doing 1,700 prescriptions a week ($200-$300 price range) with a strong growth pattern.

The active ingredient in the gel had been previously approved and so the 505(b)2 regulatory pathway is in use. The drug also has a QIDP Tag. The company estimates development costs to get this product to FDA approval at less than $10M. Due to the high potential efficacy, the company is targeting the drug as first line therapy. Due to the more favorable efficacy profile of DARE-BV1 as a one time use gel, a conservative assumption would be 100 M in peak sales in line with Solosec (although the share of patients receiving treatment should grow as well). Patents covering the licensed technology have terms through 2028 with pending patents expanding this through 2035.

Daré recently got clearance to commence the Phase 3 study of DARE-BV1 in \~220 women in 2020 to support the final submission. Thus, the FDA review should be finalized in 2021 without a CRL. We put the approval odds >80% given the history and well-studied efficacy profile of Clindamycin Phosphate, QIDP designation, lack of safety concerns, and strong efficacy profile with a small number of patients in the proof of concept study.

Thus, if we estimate the valuation solely on DARE-BV1 with some napkin math, and say the drug fetches around 1x sales, this puts the valuation of an approved DARE-BV1 around 100m or so after complete approval.

Thus, even with 100% dilution to get the drug fully approved (though the company has >2.4 m in cash and will likely sign a partnership deal to get cash beforehand) the market is implying a mere 30% approval chance ignoring the company's other drugs ( based on a market cap around 30 M after dilution).

This also means if approved, Dare could be a 3x return just on the basis of DARE-BV1 without dilution, and a 6x return with negligible dilution.

Ovaprene -

Ovaprene is a first-in-category contraceptive. This is a non-hormonal vaginal ring which is inserted by the woman on a monthly basis. The drug meets a few key preferences - Not used during intercourse, Woman controlled – placed by the woman and not by a physician, No fertility issue – immediate return to fertility with removal, and Hormone free.

A pivotal phase 3 should be launched in the second half 2020 with an FDA filing also expected later in 2020 or early 2021. The company recently announced the results of its Postcoital Study of Ovaprene, which were extremely positive. In our view, Ovaprene is fairly likely to be a new category of non-hormone, once a month contraceptive. Nuva Ring (owned by Merck), which is a hormone base ring used in a similar manner has sales of about $902M in 2018. Ovaprene is used very similarly, has no hormones and also seems to have a very strong efficacy profile.

Ovaprene prevented the requisite number of sperm from reaching the cervix across all women and all cycles evaluated. Specifically, in 100% of women and cycles, an average of less than five (< 5) progressively motile sperm (PMS) per high power field (HPF) were present in the midcycle cervical mucus collected two to three hours after intercourse with Ovaprene in place. The study presented strong statistical significance with N=26 women.

The licensing agreement includes up to $14.6M in product development milestone payments, up to additional $20M milestone payments related to commercialization, and 1-10% royalties. Patents covering the licensed technology have been granted with terms through 2028, with an opportunity for patent term extension and potential new patents.

This is where the valuation could get pretty crazy – we won’t go through the dilution scenario since a partnership deal is more likely in the cards before approval for 2020.

When the CEO was asked about BD interest regarding the 3 key programs on Nov 14th Q3 Call –

“I can't stress enough, and I'll put in all bolds if I could how incredibly fortunate to see the level of interest that we continue to see across the programs... We're super excited about that level of interest, and we're having that level of interest because we have 3 programs each of which is at an interesting value inflection point. Ovaprene having reported the kind of data we just reported given the field of PCT studies and how robust our PCT study is and how predictive these kinds of studies are of highly effective contraceptive methods. Clearly being the first potential monthly hormone-free contraceptive, lots of interest in Ovaprene obviously.”

What would Ovaprene be worth to a potential suitor? Considering the comparable Nuva Ring, with over $900 M in annual sales, and the lack of hormone involvement with Ovaprene, we don’t think it would be unachievable for Ovaprene to be worth at least in the ballpark of 150-900 M with just a final phase 3 study in 2H 2020 before the FDA Regulatory Review.

Therefore, if the company were to receive \~$150 M in compensation today for some sort of partnership regarding Ovaprene the stock would very likely be a 10-bagger on this catalyst. The mere market cap of 14 M seems to suggest that either Ovaprene will not be approved, or the company will not be able to sign a partnership deal even if approved.

Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% -

We won’t dive too deep into Sildenafil, especially given that the approval timeline is likely post 2023 without any delays in Ovaprene or DARE-BV1. The valuation is already extremely compelling after our research into these two key products.

Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% is a potential candidate for treating Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) which is characterized primarily by an inability to attain or maintain sufficient physical sexual arousal. The Cream is the female analog to Viagra, and actually has the same active ingredient. For this reason, the company will seek to leverage the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for the product. The phase 2b “At Home Study” is anticipated to initiate soon with topline data in late 2020. We think the approval odds are fairly high given the same active ingredient as Viagra and no currently approved treatment.

Recent studies indicate that 33% of women in the US experience symptoms of low / no sexual arousal, with give or take 16% of this population (\~10M women) actively seeking treatment.

FSAD has no approved treatment and it is reasonable to assume 10% of those actively seeking treatment use the product, and we will add some margin of safety / padding for the valuation given that the studies may be off in saying only 2.5M women are seeking treatment. Viagra used to be around \~$60/pill back in 2017, and a conservative annual cost of give or take $400 per patient puts us around 250,000 women with annual sales of $100M. In our view, this seems a little obscene juxtaposed with the market cap of 14 M and negligible debt, especially with the other two opportunities outlined above.

In summary, Dare's goal is to advance these programs until enough value was created to sign a partnership deal. The nano-cap will not take any product to market by itself, as this will force too way too much dilution onto existing shareholders. Since inception no partnership deals were signed since most programs were too early stage and recently acquired by the company. We believe that such a deal will be a major catalyst for the share price, and is likely next year given management’s sentiment and the recent news regarding Ovaprene and DARE-BV1. Announcements regarding positive outcomes from studies have surprisingly not moved the company’s stock price, but partnerships should force some value realization here.

I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

t3_emy35d,Why are people so bearish on MAC?,"I can't claim to be an expert on the stock market, especially not REITS (real estate investment trusts) but I find the way the market is punishing MAC really irrational. 

1. I see the argument for the retail apocalypse and the rise in e-commerce, and how that would take out department stores leading to bankruptcies that would ultimately affect the landlords (malls), but wouldn‘t AAA malls be able to avoid that? These premium buildings are about the experience (entertainment, restaurants, etc). Also, who buys luxury goods over the internet? (I know I don‘t buy jewelry over the internet but perhaps the general population is vastly different). So, in my opinion, although the premium malls that MAC manages may be affected by the retail apocalypse, I see the effects as small scale.

2. Another problem has come to my attention, namely low FFO (a sort of a measure of earnings for REITS). However, MAC have been concentrating their portfolio; disposing of subprime malls in favor of their best performers (leading to investment expenses). A project in Philadelphia is expected to start generating income in 2020 which may improve the FFO. Also the sales numbers from the stores and the occupancy rates are solid.

t3_eomqf9,Berjaya Food Berhad (5196.KL),"Berjaya Food Berhad (BJFOOD) is, as the name suggests, an F&B restaurant company. What you may not know is that it is the master franchisor (i.e. regional operator) of the Starbucks brand of companies in Malaysia. That’s right, BJFOOD owns Starbucks in Malaysia! Hence, if you want some exposure to this amazing global brand for a reasonably affordable outlay, you can consider investing in this stock. 

**Pricing Power**

What’s to like about this stock? Basically, it’s the fact that it is Starbucks. I previously talked about the importance of pricing power in my last article. Starbucks too clearly has pricing power in its products. A casual observer would notice that the company hikes the prices of its products by about 5% about once every 3 years to keep up with inflation. That is, in my opinion, an extraordinary feat – a recurring, perpetual ability to increase prices without affecting demand. This has been apparent in its rising revenue over time, from RM 376M in 2015 to RM 788M in 2019.

**Sales**

Of course, the increase in revenue hasn’t come from simply hiking prices. BJFOOD has another miraculous capacity – the ability to guarantee demand and print cash from its stores simply by virtue of existing. That’s the power of the Starbucks brand. Practically none of its stores are non-performing, with only 4 or 5 stores having been closed down due to performance issues since its debut on the stock market. BJFOOD has been increasing its store count by roughly 10% per year like clockwork ever since it began, reaching nearly 300 stores for the financial year ending 2019. In other words, you can approximately bet that it will increase revenue by at least 10% a year. That is, in my opinion, another astounding feat.

None of this would be considerable, of course, without considering the same-store sales growth (SSSG) metric. SSSG is basically the growth in sales which the company experiences from its existing stores y-o-y, without accounting for growth in sales from new stores. This basically measures performance of the stores on an apples-to-apples basis from one year to the next. SSSG from Starbucks stores has been approximately 5-6% per year for each of the last five years, which if you’re not familiar with the retail industry, is a really good milestone to achieve. 

**Cash Flow**

So far, there’s much to like about the company – but we’ve only talked about one thing, Sales! There’s another thing to like about this company, and that is Cash Flow! Put simply, the cash flow profile of this company is excellent. Putting aside the fact that the company prints money like clockwork every year – as evident from its steady, recurrent Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow – the working capital position is out of this world. Firstly, it has very low inventory and receivable days simply because it deals with perishable goods and because its customers tend to transact in cash terms. However, what one might miss is the fact that it also has high Payable days because Starbucks has strong bargaining power over its suppliers. 

Aside from that, it has a special line item on its balance sheet known as Deferred Income. This is basically mostly the prepaid value stored on its Starbucks cards, which totalled nearly RM 70M as at FY2019 (compared to annual profits of RM 24M). In other words, Starbucks utilizes the cash value stored on its Starbucks cards to pay suppliers before it even makes a sale! Think about it, normally, a company needs to come up with cash upfront from investors to pay suppliers for inventory before it can start selling products and earning revenue. In Starbucks’ case, it uses the prepaid value of its cards to pay suppliers in order to buy inventory, then sells the products without a single cent being contributed by investors! This is called negative working capital, a cash profile in a company as rare and desirable as a true real-life unicorn. As a result, putting together receivable days, inventory days, payable days and deferred income, you get an obscenely low Cash Conversion Ratio. In other words, this is a company which will never go bankrupt due to cash issues. 

**Growth**

With all the above considered, you can expect steady annual revenue growth of 15% (10% from new stores + 5% from existing stores) into perpetuity, do a margin analysis to arrive at earnings growth, and attach a multiple to arrive at a reasonable valuation. It is the simplest type of business to value, almost utility-like in characteristic. Cash flow is a non-issue since the Starbucks brand simply prints money like clockwork. This is the mother of business models to fall in love with. No wonder the Starbucks stock in the US has performed so well over the years!

**Risks & Opportunities**

So what are the risks? Well, for one the company has shored up a lot of debt in order to wholly acquire the Starbucks franchise in 2014. As of FY2019, it had long-term debt of RM 127M and short-term debt of RM 161M – and the figure keeps rolling over ever higher and higher year-over-year. This is in comparison to Operating Cash Flow of RM 131M and Free Cash Flow of about RM 50M in FY19. Not the worst of positions to be in, all things considered, but it could be better. Ideally, I’d love if the company would focus on paring down its debt instead of paying dividends (which amounted to RM 15M for FY19).

Another risk, which I haven’t talked about yet, is the fact that the company also has other food franchises under its hood. That’s right, BJFOOD does not only own the Starbucks franchise, it also owns two other restaurant franchises. These are the Kenny Rogers brand and the Jollibean brand. Unfortunately for BJFOOD, both of these franchises are non-performing, with the former roughly breaking even over the years while the latter is loss-making. However, they are roughly self-sufficient when considering the scale of the company, and not too much of a headache if history is anything to go by. 

From a capital perspective, it pays to mention that the company hasn’t issued significant amounts of equity over its lifetime. It has a lot of debt, but it pays a roughly 1% dividend yield and it is quite active in stock buybacks (owning 4% of outstanding shares in treasury stock as of FY19). This is ideal as the business is utility-like in its cash flow structure (i.e. Starbucks basically prints money), and it earns enough cash flow to both pay back coupons and return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. 

Another risk that one may naturally consider is the fluctuating price of raw materials, specifically coffee beans. However, it should be noted that coffee beans only make up 10% of costs of raw materials because Starbucks’ main money maker is its frappuccinos and flavoured drinks, not its coffees. Hence, a rise in prices of coffee beans does not hugely impact its bottom line. You may even be surprised to find out that its biggest cost component (from a gross margin perspective) is actually milk!

What are the opportunities for Starbucks, or BJFOOD in particular? Well, not much to be honest. If you like this stock, it’s because you’re comfortable with approximately 15% revenue growth year-over-year. This isn’t going to be a multi-bagger for the same reasons it isn’t going to go bankrupt – because it’s a stable, boring business. And that’s okay, in fact, that’s more than okay. But just know what you’re getting into.

**Valuation**

Okay, we’ve gone over the business and its financials, let’s come to the last topic, Valuation. At 22x PE with mediocre earnings growth of about 10%, its not a particular attractive valuation. But keep in mind that you’re also paying a premium for the steady brand that is Starbucks and all its salient attributes. At this price of RM 1.33, I don’t think it’s a particularly attractive stock. But you definitely should keep it on your watchlist in case the stock craters to approximately RM 1.

**Summary**

To conclude, this is a reasonably attractive stock that you should keep on your watchlist because of its excellent business and cash flow characteristics. If the share price ever falls to RM 1, scoop it up by the truckload.

Lollapalooza building up in certain retail stocks. The negative sentiment towards certain retail stocks has sufficiently compounded to be an opportune asymmetrical upside for certain retail common stocks.

The addition of accounting rules whereby lease liabilities are added to the balance sheet does not alter the projected free cash flows, yet has influenced the valuation of companies in the retail industry. As much as I understand why an investor would perceive this as increased risk or decreased valuation due to a sharp rise in Enterprise Value, I also believe this is an ignorant approach to investing because this information was always available to investors who did no more than open an annual report, or simply understood real estate leases have always been financial obligations, regardless of their treatment on the balance sheet.

Zero likelihood of bankruptcy over next 12-24 months given momentum of cashflows in relation to available liquidity including outstanding lines of credit. 

Market cap pricing which is approximately 1x historical free cashflow average.

Price to Sales ratio are currently multiple standards of deviation below all time historical lows.

Significant potential momentum once maximum pessimism subsides, since these are widely held stocks, unlike two other 'cheap' stocks like SUMR and SCOO, which also fit the criteria, yet have extremely limited trading volume in relation.

To see two examples of companies in the middle of retail turnarounds with an uncertain futures, which were/are priced similarly at liquidation: ±1x average FCF, but underwent 5x runs within months, look at SSI, and CBKC.

I believe that these are two examples of cigar butts, as their future is perhaps uncertain, but the price is so low, that if you owned 100% of the shares right now, you could extract the more value in physical cash dollar bills that are owned by the company. The challenge with a minority position is that you are betting that other investors will price in this potentiality, or betting that the company will actually turnaround and pay you back much more but much later. The reality is  that management or the board will not distribute cash back to investors as this time, and their 3-5 year futures are uncertain, and so this method of valuation does not appear to have teeth, but it is apparent that the investment community traditionally does price in this as a potential event nonetheless.

Based on experience, these stocks could STILL go down around 50% from here, but have the upside potential of 2x - 10x within a 12-24 month period.

t3_es8m1o,ATIS: An Undervalued Micro-Cap Conglomerate with Hidden Assets (0.35; 01/22/20),"^(TL;DR at the very bottom. Not sure if I'm completely delusional or there's actually something here. Let me know what ya think.)

# Business Overview

Attis Industries, formerly known as Meridian Waste Solutions, is a conglomerate with business operations in the healthcare, medical waste, and environmental technology sectors. Their main operations are split into three segments; Attis Healthcare, Attis Innovations, and Flux Carbon LLC (JVCo 80% Ownership). Attis Industries currently sells on the OTC markets at a market capitalization of less than $2,500,000 and has a total of 6,680,000 common shares outstanding.

# 

# Operations Overview

*Attis Innovations* leverages its ability to source low-cost renewable feedstocks with proprietary conversion technology to produce high performance, sustainable materials for everyday products.

*Attis Healthcare* strives to improve patient care and enable better patient outcomes by providing cost-saving opportunities through innovative and comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for patients and healthcare providers.

*Flux Carbon LLC* (JVCo 80% Ownership) holds the rights to an expansive portfolio of clean technologies and manages existing engineering and licensing businesses.

# 

# Investment Thesis

*Attis Industries* is currently undergoing a transition from a waste management company to a multi-oriented conglomerate. They are delinquent on multiple SEC filings and this has turned into a major catalyst for the company's share price. While delinquent financials usually spell trouble for a company, Attis Industries has become a special situation whereupon the completion and submission of their financial reports, the market will hopefully realize the true value of the company’s assets. From what I’ve gathered, Attis’ current book value of $13,700,000 does not represent the fair value of the company's assets. Upon completion and submission of their financial reports, true book value will be closer to $50,000,000 due to financing and recent acquisitions not stated in Attis' most recent filing. Not only are Attis' asset values extremely understated, but revenues are grossly understated aswell. The company's latest filing states a revenue figure of only $1,070,000. Attis' full-year 2020 revenue projections are stated at roughly $160,000,000. While the timeline for the posting of Attis' financials is still unclear, they have taken many positive steps in the right direction over the last year and made this statement upon delisting on 11/19/19:

>“Attis is continuing to work tirelessly with its independent accounting firm to bring all of its delinquent filings current. Once all of the filings have been completed and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and all other listing requirements have been met, the Company plans to immediately begin the reapplication process with the Exchange to elevate Attis’ publicly available securities back to the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.”

In Attis’ case, I would say actions speak louder than words and the crux of this thesis is dependent on them following through on this promise. The notable actions they have taken over the last year include the recent hiring of an SEC Financial Reporting Director, the transition to BDO as their independent auditor, and the implementation of strict accounting procedures across all business segments. While these changes don't point to an exact filing date, they have significantly increased the odds of Attis coming through on their promise to update their filings and will bring forth much-needed clarity and transparency from the company to the public markets when financials are finally posted.

# 

# Financial Projections

As stated before, Attis' operations can be split into three operating segments; Attis Innovations, Attis Healthcare, and Flux Carbon LLC.

*Attis Innovations* is expected to have generated $150,000,000 in ""guaranteed"" revenues by the end of full-year 2020. These revenues are guaranteed through a 10-year off-take agreement with Sunoco at Attis' Fulton Ethanol Plant.  Attis purchased the Fulton Ethanol facility from Sunoco in June of 2019 at a price of $20,000,000 and the facility was recently appraised at a value of $57,000,000. If you compare Attis' Fulton operations to a competitor like Valero, you'll find that Fulton's operating profit could be in the range of $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 by the end full-year 2020. Attis has plans to take Fulton from an 85,000,000 gallon ethanol facility to a 100,000,000 gallon facility adding an additional $20,000,000 to revenues upon completion of the upgrades.

*Attis Healthcare* has stated that upon full rollout of their operations, they expect revenues to be close to $100,000,000. Robert Dunn, president of Attis Healthcare, has projected full-year 2019 healthcare revenues to have been between $10,000,000 and $12,000,000. He made this statement in late 2018 (press release dated 10/22/18):

>""Deep market analysis has led Attis Healthcare to design and build its current lab infrastructure to handle samples that would produce revenue of $10-$12 million and margins between 20-25%. With further lab and infrastructure build-out and a concentrated effort by our contracted sales force, I believe we can double our expected revenue in the next 12 to 18 months.”

With revenues of approximately $10,000,000 and a gross margin of between 20 to 25%, operating profits for the segment should be somewhere around $1,000,000. The total acquisition costs attached to Attis' healthcare segment since inception is roughly $7,000,000.

*Flux Carbon LLC* is said to be producing roughly $14,000,000 in annualized revenues as of 06/21/18, with gross margins close to 70% and an operating profit at least $4,000,000. The total cost of Attis' 80% ownership of Flux Carbon LLC is estimated to be around $30,000,000. As a side note, Attis, along with its JVCo partner Greenshift Corporation, launched an appeal in September of 2018 to overturn a summary judgment in a patent infringement case, where, if won, Flux Carbon LLC) could see over 90% of the corn ethanol industry paying royalties to them for patents they own. While chances of a favorable ruling appear slim, if won, this would be a huge added bonus to what Attis has already accomplished. If lost, I see the end result being a short-term, temporary set back that may provide an even better buy-in opportunity for future shareholders and signal the end of a company quiet period.

Financing for the company’s ambitions does not appear to be an issue as Attis has, within the last year, received non-dilutive financing for the purchase of their Fulton ethanol facility, received financing for their planned upgrades to their Fulton facility, and received financing for both their commercial and federal labs. Attis is also in the process of restructuring debt in an attempt to eliminate future dilution.

In conclusion, by the end of full-year 2020, Attis is projecting to have produced $150,000,000 in guaranteed revenues, $24,000,000 in non-guaranteed revenues, and an estimated $8,000,000 in operating profit across all segments. Today, Attis Industries currently trades on the OTC markets at a market capitalization of less than $2,500,000. Upon completion and filing of their financials, I can easily see Attis' market capitalization being no less than a conservative $20,000,000, a possible 10x return.

# The Formation of Attis

On 02/20/18, Meridian Waste Solutions sold their waste management service operations to Warren Equity Partners for $90,000,000 and the remaining operations were rebranded as Attis Industries. The transaction eliminated $87,000,000 of debt and allowed the newly formed entity, Attis Industries, to pursue new business opportunities in higher-margin industries. The remaining assets, not sold in the deal, were expected to generate $3,000,000 in pre-tax earnings and cut the company’s debt burden by 90%, according to Jeff Cosman, Attis Industries CEO.

Since the formation of Attis in 2018, the company has made multiple acquisitions, formed multiple partnerships, and launched an appeal to overturn a summary judgment in a patent infringement case tied to their subsidiary, Flux Carbon LLC. First, we will tackle the acquisitions and partnerships they have made since inception. For the sake of structure, I have organized the partnerships and acquisitions under four banners; Attis Innovations, Attis Healthcare, Flux Carbon LLC, and Other. The “other” category pertains to acquisitions and partnerships that have not been finalized but are still “in the works.”

Genarex FD LCC 49% Interest

* Acquisition Date: 05/29/18
* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/attis-industries-acquires-49-stake-in-genarex](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/attis-industries-acquires-49-stake-in-genarex)
* Attis purchased a 49% stake in Genarex FD LLC. Genarex is a technology development company focused on refining low-cost renewable feedstocks into functional biofillers. Genarex is capable of recovering about 1.1 pounds of biobased plastics additive per gallon of ethanol produced, which equates to an expected $11 million in new EBITDA from each 100 million gallon per year ethanol facility. Under applicable agreements, the Company agreed, in pertinent part, to pay an aggregate purchase price of $2,266,667, plus 8% of the EBITDA and certain material transaction proceeds of the Company’s Innovations group.

FLUX Carbon LLC 80% Interest(JVCo)

* Acquisition Date: 05/31/19
* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/attis-industries-acquires-clean-technology-licensing](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/attis-industries-acquires-clean-technology-licensing)
* JVCo is a new joint venture company between Attis Industries and Greenshift Corporation that holds the rights to an expansive portfolio of clean technologies and manages an existing engineering and licensing business. This new joint venture can be expected to initially contribute between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 to Attis’ earnings. The existing business generated approximately $7,000,000 per year in sales with gross margins of about 70% for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017. The Company agreed to pay an earn-out based purchase price with a floor of $18 million. An initial payment was paid at closing in the form of restricted shares of the Company’s stock, including 180,000 shares of the Company’s Series G preferred stock. GreenShift is required to use the first proceeds received upon sale of the shares to pay or refinance its senior secured debt.
* The opportunity with Greenshift and JVCo could be huge for Attis. Greenshift is currently in legal battles over patent infringement, claiming that multiple ethanol producers have infringed on their patents. According to Attis, “CleanTech and its inventors developed and commercialized a process that intercepts the flow of that final third in the plant, extracts corn oil, and returns the stream back to the host for completion of drying. The extracted oil is then most commonly sold as a feedstock for refining into biodiesel for about $0.25 per pound. CleanTech has licensed its portfolio of corn oil extraction patents to producers of about 12% of the 15 billion gallons of ethanol produced annually in the U.S. However, CleanTech estimates that upwards of 90% of the corn ethanol industry practices methods covered by CleanTech’s patents, and some of those patents are the subject of litigation which CleanTech has asserted against about 10% of the industry alleging infringing use since 2010.”
* On 09/05/18, Attis and Greenshift filed an appeal to overturn a summary judgment deeming GreenShift’s patents unenforceable. Oral arguments recently took place on December 3rd and the final verdict is still under deliberation.

* The laboratory has already received COLA accreditation for laboratory quality assurance, expects CLIA certification in the coming weeks, and is now in the application process for Medicare coverage for all states and Medicaid coverage in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Colorado and New Mexico.

CLIA License

* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/44/attis-industries-obtains-clia-certification-for-its-first](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/44/attis-industries-obtains-clia-certification-for-its-first)
* Attis obtained its CLIA Certification for its first internally developed lab. The Company expects that this federal laboratory will be testing a baseline of 3,000 toxicology samples per month by the end of 2018, which trends to approximately $600,000 per month of revenue and over $7,000,0000 for 2018. The Company also expects to add blood testing to its federal laboratory by the end of the year, which will drive additional revenue growth for the Company moving forward. By the second quarter of 2019, they expect the combined number of blood and toxicology samples in the federal lab to be between 5,000 and 8,000 per month. This means the federal lab is expected to be generating over $1,000,000 in revenue per month by mid-2019.

CMS License

* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/58/attis-industries-secures-medicare-license-for-tulsa](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/58/attis-industries-secures-medicare-license-for-tulsa)
* Attis announced that it has received the Medicare license for its toxicology laboratory in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The laboratory, which received its CLIA license in August, is dedicated to running samples reimbursed by Medicare and individual state Medicaid programs only (“federal lab”). Now that Attis has received its CMS license, which provides Medicare coverage for all states, Attis will begin taking samples and billing under its new Medicare number while at the same time begin applying for Medicaid coverage for the states of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Colorado and New Mexico. Deep market analysis has led Attis Healthcare to design and build its current lab infrastructure to handle samples that would produce revenue of $10-$12 million and margins between 20-25%. “With further lab and infrastructure build-out and a concentrated effort by our contracted sales force, I believe we can double our expected revenue in the next 12 to 18 months.”

t3_eubk2k,A quick take of AutoWeb (AUTO),"This is a brief overview of AUTO. I was introduced to AUTO late last year and recently got around to taking a look at this business recently. I was attracted to it primarily because this is a lead gen business which has many of the same qualities as SaaS businesses on their rev gen side (marketing metrics/conversion rates).

AUTO acquire website traffic via their portfolio of sites, convert this traffic into leads, and sells it to local dealerships. A capital light business that have some similarities to SaaS and tech businesses we’re normally invested in.

Ultimately I decided against taking any positions, but I thought I’d share my quick analysis of AUTO with those who are interested.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

AUTO is a lead gen business that owns a portfolio of automobile related websites, namely: [autobytel.com](https://autobytel.com), [car.com](https://car.com), [usedcars.com](https://usedcars.com), and [usedtrucks.com](https://usedtrucks.com).

This is a an asset and capex light business in that they generate traffic from different sources (which I’ll cover briefly below), convert these traffic into leads of customers who are interested in used cars, and then sell these leads to local dealerships who has the inventory of the cars customers want.

&#x200B;

In a general sense, AUTO’s business makes sense and provides value for both their partners (car buyers and car sellers).

 

I’ll spare everyone the history of the business, but the short version is the old management team was shown the door due to poor management and declining revenues. New CEO was brought in and brought in his own executive team in 2019.

&#x200B;

When the old guards leave and new ones come into a declining business, investors want to see the following:

1	Transparency, and honesty on how the business is actually performing (PAR’s new CEO is a great example of how a new CEO should act)

2	A plan to get the business back on track

3	Signs that the business is stabilizing

 

Unfortunately I would rate management’s #1 & #2 as a 5/10 at best, and as for #3, there’s been no signs the business decline is stabilizing.

 

\#1 & #2: After joining, the new management’s plan is essentially optimizing on revenue per lead as opposed to driving new leads. This is very disappointing as it shows management has no plan to solve the root cause of their problem to begin with, which was the decline in traffic (i.e., revenue).

 

I’m equally disappointed in the constant frugality talk instead of solving their root problem. “What you’ll find is that we are doing more with what we have” (19Q3 CC)

 

Most of the company’s trouble have to do with a decline in traffic and unfortunate timing in the slowdown of the US auto market. AUTO lost many of their paying car dealerships in the last 2 years in the market wide slowdown. However this is conflicting, as when car sales drop, you would think car dealerships would be more inclined to buy qualifying leads.

 

This leads me to believe car dealerships do not find AUTO’s leads meaningful in providing a ROI, and dealerships are cutting cost around ineffective marketing (AUTO’s leads) and increasing spend elsewhere (Google Ads).

&#x200B;

Indeed, management have also signaled in conference calls that they have been revamping their internal tracking systems to better show ROI for dealerships.

&#x200B;

I believe until this problem is solved and dealerships are persuaded that they should be spending their marketing dollars with AUTO, AUTO will continue to experience difficulties keeping old clients and signing new ones.

 

\#3: As mentioned earlier, I was initially attracted to AUTO’s business model frankly because the same rev gen models that are used to calculate conversion rates from SaaS or growth tech companies can also be used with AUTO.

&#x200B;

At it’s root, AUTO can sell more leads if it can generate more leads, and if it can generate more leads if it gets more traffic. However the decline of their traffic have resulted in a decline in revenue, and new management is currently optimizing this remaining traffic instead of growing their traffic base.

 

While optimizing their conversion rates is a understandable thing to do, you’ll never grow if you’re forced to make more with the same amount. You don’t get rich by trying to make the most of a minimum wage job, you get rich by making more money (while also optimizing your monthly spend).

 

It’s admirable that the new management is looking to stabilize the business by increasing conversion rates and optimizing lead revenue, but this doesn’t fundamentally change their situation until they can find a way to renew their lost traffic. The current optimization plans will at best get them to a rough breakeven point. Their current market cap is 30M, with a 1.1M balance sheet while losing 2M per quarter. While they can likely bring in some AR, this will likely only buy them a longer runway until they can solve the real problem.

 

Importantly, we noticed AUTO’s primary website [Autobytel.com](https://Autobytel.com)’s traffic halved in late August 2019, dropping from an average of 1.2M visitors per month, to 600k per month:

&#x200B;

With Q4 2019 earnings coming up, AUTO will likely be reporting more bad news before any good ones come in.

 

For now, I’ll be waiting on the sidelines until they can prove they have a plan to increase traffic and revenue, show stabilization in quarterly losses, and importantly show some honesty in their performance metrics.

&#x200B;

Feedback is welcome if I missed anything, I may take another look at it in the future.

&nbsp; 

*In 1987, Buffett famously stated, ""I'll tell you why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It's addictive. And there's fantastic brand loyalty.""*

*“The best business to own is one that over an extended period of time can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return.” – Warren Buffett*

*“Invest at the point of maximum pessimism.” – John Templeton*

&nbsp;

Warren Buffett’s best winners have always been stocks which were bought during times of maximum pessimism. GEICO was bought on the brink of bankruptcy. AMEX was bought during the Salad Oil Scandal. Goldman Sachs was also bought with bankruptcy looming. Wells Fargo was a bank with a largely residential loan book bought during a housing crisis. Coca-Cola was bought at a time of massive overdiversification. And so on and so forth.   

It’s not often that one has the opportunity to put into practice the all-encompassing philosophy of buy low, sell high. But even when that opportunity rears its ugly head, it’s the rare investor who has the aptitude and the stomach to back up the truck. Thankfully, these opportunities do exist, but it takes a keen eye to discern the difference between a falling knife and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

&nbsp;

**Overview**

British American Tobacco (BAT) Malaysia is one such example. Currently trading at just ***8x PE, sporting a 100% ROE, and giving a 15% dividend yield***, it’s hard not to salivate a little at the financial statistics. But why is such a high ROI stock – a cigarette company no less – trading at such awfully low valuations? 

First, some history. BAT Malaysia is the largest cigarette company in the country, with a roughly 50% legal market share and 12% total industry market share. If you’re observant, you’ll notice that Malaysia’s illegal cigarette market share takes up a whopping 65% share of the pie. This was largely due to the massive excise duty (i.e. sin tax) hike in 2015, which brought illegal market share from a reasonable 33% before the hike to 65% and rising today. 

As a result, BAT Malaysia has suffered massive share price declines, with the share price falling by 85% in the past 5 years (from RM 60 in 2015) and 70% in the past 12 months alone (from RM 37 in early-2019). This was largely due to revenue declines of nearly 20% and earnings decline of 40% over the past 3 years, with a corresponding shortfall in dividends (the company has a 90% dividend policy). ROE has also fallen from approximately 200% to around 100% today. 

Thus, it’s not surprising that the stock has taken such a beating. Indeed, over the past two weeks alone the stock price has fallen by about 30%. But is investing in it now simply trying to catch a falling knife?

&nbsp;

**Business Narrative**

The source of the problem can largely be traced back to the sin tax hike in 2015, which brought illegal cigarette market share from 33% to 65% over the past 5 years. The Malaysian government has not been very accommodative to local industry players, rebuffing efforts to reduce the sin tax and dragging its feet when it comes to the enforcement of existing laws and the introduction of new ones. The local Customs department, working together with the police, has had some success in recent years tackling the illegal cigarette cartel – arresting the decline in legal market share from 20%-30% annually to just above 10% in the past year – but efforts are largely seen as too little, too late. On top of that, the illegal vaping scene has blossomed in Malaysia, with nicotine-related products claiming up to 10% of total industry market share. 

This backdrop has inspired analysts to impose doomsday scenarios for the legal industry players (i.e. BAT, PMI & JTI), according present values to the companies which reflect a resumption of historical revenue and market share declines. Indeed, when parsing the financial statements of BAT, it’s not impossible to forecast revenues declining to a point where they fall below operating costs (i.e. EBITDA of zero), rendering the equity essentially worthless valuation-wise. 

The main reason for the government’s lack of progress is bureaucracy. Different governmental ministries have drawn different interpretations of their legal jurisdiction regarding the matter, and thus shuffle the responsibility of arresting the illegal trade to their peers. For instance, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has stated that it has no authority to enforce legislation against illegal cigarettes, while the Customs department disagrees and says it is the MOH’s prerogative to clamp down on illegal cigarette packets which don’t portray mandatory and unsightly health warnings (illegal cigarette packets tend not to include them). As a result of the red tape, there has been little progress on the front lines, and legal industry players are lesser of for it. 

BAT and JTI (the two largest cigarette players) have resorted to shutting down their manufacturing operations and implementing an importation business model, where legal cigarettes are imported from Indonesia into the country to be sold. BAT has also gone through one round of layoffs last year, with a second round expected in 2020. 

&nbsp;

**Financials**

As alluded to earlier, revenues have declined by 20% over the past 3 years while net profit has declined by 40%. This was surprisingly not due to a contraction of Gross Margin (which you’d expect as costs go up when switching from a manufacturing model to an importation model), but largely as a result of revenues falling while operating costs remain the same. This can be seen in the Operating Margin falling from a high of 24% in 17Q3 to 18% in 19Q3, and net margin contracting from 18% in 17Q3 to 13% in 19Q3. 

On the balance sheet side, things look much rosier. Intangibles take up the lion’s share of assets (40%), while Inventories and Receivables have declined slightly in line with the fall in Revenue. Net cash is negative owing to a revolving credit facility which the company has drawn presumably for tax reasons. The debt is current in nature and can be paid back in full with 2 years of Free Cash Flow. The company doesn’t have much fixed assets remaining following the closure of its manufacturing plant, indicating that liquidation value (approximately zero) falls far short of market value. Current ratio is reasonable at 0.8x. Share capital has not changed for at least 3 years. 

Receivable days and Inventory days have respectively increased by roughly 50% over the last 3 years – indicating a struggling business which is facing business challenges from its illegal brethren. Payable days have remained static over the same time period. As a result, Cash Conversion Cycle stands at 79 days, up by double from 33 days in 2018. 

Cash flow is still stable, with cash receipts approximating revenues. Free Cash Flow is almost equal to Operating Cash Flow, exemplifying the asset-light nature of the current business. The company pays out the entirety of its FCF as dividends (and then some), leading to a dividend yield of 15% at the current share price and a 118% dividend payout ratio. 

&nbsp;

**Risks**

The risks are apparent. If the government doesn’t do something about the illegal trade and allows it to run rampant, it’s possible that illegal market share increases from here and revenues continue to decline. In the worst-case scenario, it’s not hard to envision revenues falling below operating costs and EBITDA reaching zero, implying the shares are worthless and that dividends will be cut or even stopped entirely.

The current share price of 8x PE (RM 10.00) reflects this doomsday view. The market is basically pricing in declining earnings growth into perpetuity and giving no stock to a potential turnaround. Government intervention to address the illegal trade is widely perceived as sorely lacking and possibly not existing, with analysts imputing revenue declines of up to 30% a year into their models. Share price targets range from RM 11 – RM 15, although the share price has fallen by some 20% since the last revision of analyst reports. All in all, it seems like bad news for BAT.

&nbsp;

**Opportunities**

The opportunities for BAT, while less apparent, do exist. For one, the government could by some miracle successfully enforce existing laws and put the brakes on illegal trade – it has already slowed the latter’s advance by some 50% since the sin tax hike. 
Alternatively, the government could recognize the disadvantages of the narrowing tax base from legal cigarettes and decide to reverse or reduce the sin tax, leading to a reclaiming of legal market share by industry players to previous highs. By some back-of-the-envelope calculations, if legal market share rises to just half of their historical levels, BAT’s earnings and share price could double from here. PE ratios would also expand in such a scenario. 

BAT’s parent company in London could also decide to acquire the Malaysian subsidiary given the depressed prices. A fair market price given the circumstances would be roughly 15x PE, which assuming earnings continue to decline by 30% from today, would put the acquisition price at around 120-130% from current share prices. 

BAT has also been experimenting with nicotine-related products, such as the Heat-Not-Burn (HNB) device known as Glo (PMI has a branded competitor known as IQOS). Both have received glowing reviews from former cigarette users and is expected to help the companies transition into the post-smoking era (i.e. 20-30 years from now). So far, Glo has developed a 1% total industry market share in Malaysia despite only being launched 2 years ago, showcasing its popularity and potential success. 

Finally, the government is preparing the release of new legislation regarding vaping, which is due to see light by mid-2020. While legalization is still not guaranteed, government officials have publicly admitted the difficulty of enforcing laws if a vaping ban were to be instituted. If vaping is legalized, the legal industry could see a 10% increase in market share overnight as they introduce their own products to supplement the demand for currently illegal products. 

&nbsp;

**Risk : Reward**

In my opinion, current share prices have priced in all the risks while discounting all the opportunities. Even assuming earnings decline at an average annual rate of 10% into perpetuity, it would take just ten years to reclaim your initial investment. This is assuming illegal market share continues its rise unabated and legal market share never sees the light of day again. Keep in mind that the company has a 90% dividend payout policy, and has kept this rate despite recent struggles in its business, so you’d get a return of capital regardless of the share price performance.

In this worst-case scenario, the parent company would either push for an acquisition or liquidate the Malaysian operations. An acquisition at fire-sale prices would probably yield at least 5x PE, while a liquidation would yield nothing given the current ratio of 0.8x. The latter is highly unlikely because it would mean that BAT ceases to have a presence in Malaysia completely, a growing South East Asian nation with GDP growth of 4-5% and potentially bright future. Hence, given the probabilities and an estimate of expected value, you’d already come out on top at the current PE of 8x. 

What about the alternative? Before we get into the valuation from an opportunity set perspective, let us consider BAT’s business model. As Buffett says, this is a company with unit economics of a penny per cigarette, selling them at a dollar per cigarette, fantastic brand loyalty and a captive audience. Imagine if you could have owned Altria in the USA in the 1970’s. Today, you’d own Altria, Kraft Heinz, PMI and a smattering of profitable businesses around the world. While I don’t mean to draw a direct comparison between BAT Malaysia today and Altria USA of the 70’s, it’s not hard to imagine a similarly wonderful future for a company with such an attractive business model. 

As far as economic moats are concerned, the cigarette business is probably one of the few businesses you can say will be around in another 20-30 years. Sure, they’re facing headwinds in the form of a burgeoning illegal cigarette trade today, but who says they will still be facing the same demons 10 years from now, or even 5 years? If there’s one thing for certain, it’s that the business environment is fluid – and chances are good that things won’t remain the same as today, whatever they may be. 

&nbsp;

**A Reasonable Bull-Case Scenario Valuation**

Let’s put the humdrums aside for a moment and imagine a brighter future for BAT. What would this future look like? For one, it’s possible that within the next 5 years the government realizes it can’t contain the illegal cigarette problem and decide to reduce the sin tax to previous levels. The wider tax base resulting from such a move would result in the same absolute amount in taxes even at lower tax rates – so there is no financial disincentive not to do so – while at the same time reducing the illegal market share. If legal market share even reclaims half of their former levels, the share price of BAT could double from today.

Furthermore, what’s stopping BAT from resuming earnings growth, assuming the business environment recovers? Even if earnings grow by just equal to GDP growth (i.e. 4-5% a year), it would justify a 15x PE at the minimum considering a long-time horizon of 20-30 years. Combine a doubling of earnings with a 15x PE, and you’re looking at a potential quadrupling (4x) of the current share price. 

&nbsp;

**A Best-Case Scenario Valuation**

If BAT reclaims its former glory and returns to its historical market capitalization of RM 18 billion, we’re talking about a 600% increase in share price. 

That’s just for the next ten years. What about dividends beyond that? Let’s imagine the best possible scenario for BAT. Assume for awhile that you’re planning to hold BAT for the next 30 years. Assume also that in ten years’ time, BAT’s share price skyrockets to 600% of current levels, and then grows earnings by 4% a year into perpetuity and pays out 90% of earnings at dividends. Account for 3% inflation and zero percent cost of capital (i.e. growth funded from retained earnings). By the end of year 30, you’d end up with 27x your initial investment, or 2700% of your capital. That’s a 12% CAGR.

In other words, a $40,000 investment in BAT today could potentially yield a million dollars in 30 year’s time. And that’s with reasonable assumptions. Tweak the numbers further and you’ll could potentially reach Buffett-like returns. 

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

To sum things up, it appears that current share prices already impute the worst-case scenario, while the best-case scenario is a 600% capital appreciation potential in ten years, or 2700% over 30 years. Giving a margin of safety, let’s dial the ten-year return of 600% down by 50% - we still get a 300% reward scenario. That’s a 12% CAGR over ten years. Not too shabby.

Assuming 50% downside from today’s prices, the upside-to-downside ratio at 300% upside would still be a healthy 1:6. Now that’s a margin of safety.

If you believe that BAT has no future in Malaysia and will ultimately be acquired or liquidated, expect share prices to fall by up to 50% from here. If you expect that the legal industry will recover to former highs and that BAT is well-positioned as the largest cigarette player in an ASEAN country with 4% GDP growth (alongside Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia), you can expect share prices to rise by at least 300% over the next 10 years. 

More realistically, share prices will fluctuate by 20% from current levels both to the upside and downside over the next year or so. If you can stomach that kind of volatility, BAT makes for a wonderful risk-reward component of your hopefully diversified emerging market portfolio. 

&nbsp;

**A Value Investor’s Perspective**

As mentioned above, Warren Buffett has a history of buying companies for pennies on the dollar when the share price reflects maximum pessimism. This does not mean to dive blindly into freefalling stocks which you do not understand. It does mean that you should do your homework, and when you spot an attractive risk:reward ratio in stocks where others are running for the exits, you should be comfortable holding a large position. 

Buying a leading cigarette company in its market while it’s beaten down represents one of the most potentially profitable investments imaginable. For reference, take a look at Altria. If you had bought $1,000 worth of shares in Altria in 1970, and reinvested all the dividends, you would be sitting on a fortune worth $5 million by today. That’s an astounding 18% CAGR over an extraordinarily long period of 50 years. Can BAT Malaysia repeat this tier of performance? Probably not, but you don’t need to in order to make a satisfying profit from it. 

Buffett espouses thinking long-term when it comes to investing. Think about the long-term when it comes to BAT Malaysia. Is it likely that illegal cigarette’s share of the market will remain elevated at 65% or above for the next 20 years continually? If I was a betting man, I’d wager that it won’t. More likely than not, some kind of unforeseen development will unfold which will bring market share back into the folds of the legal industry – it could be vaping, HNB products, a newly yet unrevealed form of nicotine-device, or even an evolution in the way smokers think. What can be relied on however is that in 20 years smokers will still continue to view nicotine, and by extension smoking-related products, as a form of entertainment and relaxation. 

Then there’s the dividends. The dividend yield on one share of Altria bought in the 1990’s held until today would exceed 30%. This is because the dividends have grown over the years in tandem with earnings growth. Extrapolate that to BAT Malaysia, which currently has a dividend yield of 15%. Assuming an average of 4% earnings growth going forward, that dividend yield would grow to just about 45% in 30 years. That’s the power of compounding. 

Buffett also champions the idea of owning companies with fortress economic moats. Some of the companies which he owns have such moats, including Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, GEICO, American Express, etc. It’s hard to argue that BAT Malaysia doesn’t have such a moat. Even in such trying times where revenues have contracted by 20%, it still sports a high-flying ROE of 100%, and stable gross margins of 30%. I would go so far as to compare BAT Malaysia today to a Coca-Cola or American Express when Buffett bought them during times of pessimism. 

Think about the future of BAT in 10 years, or 20 years’ time. It’s likely that it will have overcome the temporary hurdles which it faces today by then and resume earning high returns on significant capital invested over a long period of time. This is truly a compounding machine if there ever was one. Or as the title suggests, a wonderful company trading at a wonderful price.

Remember that Buffett’s best buys in the public markets have all been investments made during trying times, such as what BAT is facing today. AMEX could have gone bankrupt over the Salad Oil Scandal. GEICO was literally months away from being unable to service its insurance liabilities. Goldman Sachs was teetering on the brink of financial collapse under the heavy weight of subprime mortgage obligations. Coca-Cola was not the company it is today – it was an overburdened, overdiversified conglomerate with little growth outlook. Wells Fargo was staring at a huge, unserviceable loan book immediately following the Californian earthquakes given its significant residential exposure. It’s definitely nice to pay fair prices for wonderful companies, but it’s even better to be able to pay wonderful prices for wonderful companies. 

&nbsp;

In times like these, it pays to reflect on some words of wisdom for guidance:

*Buy when there’s blood in the streets.*
 
*Be greedy when others are fearful.*

*In the short-term, the market is a voting machine; in the long-term, it is a weighing machine.*

*Price is what you pay, value is what you get.*

*It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.*

*Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.*

&nbsp; 

May the investing odds be ever in your favor!

t3_f38zzn,Security Analysis of HOLI,"**Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd. (HOLI)** 

HOLI is a leading provider of automation and systems solutions in China, with overseas operations in eight other countries throughout Asia. The majority of its business is done in the industrial automation (IA) and rail transportation sectors, though it has low-margin operations in mechanical & electrical (M&E) and medical solutions as well. A miniscule debt-to-equity ratio, healthy historical cash flows, promising growth based on planned expansion in relevant sectors, and the Great Wall of China doubling as an economic moat all suggest taking a long position while the stock price hovers near its 52-week low. 

***Business Profile***

Founded in 1993 and listed on NASDAQ since 2008, HOLI has grown from research team specializing in automation control in the power industry to a multinational company with customers in sectors including power, petrochemical, high-speed rail, and urban rail. In IA, HOLI provides automation hardware, software, and services spanning field devices, control systems, enterprise manufacturing management and cloud-based applications. In rail transportation, it provides advanced signaling control and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for high-speed rail and urban rail. 

HOLI designs and manufactures all its products in-house at its facilities in Beijing and Hangzhou. Its core hardware is a printed circuit board, manufactured and assembled at the two Chinese facilities. Raw materials include bare printed circuit boards and various electronic components needed for assembly. 

Approximately 82% of the company’s total consolidated revenues are derived from integrated solutions contracts won through the bid process. The remainder of revenue is generated through sales of spare parts, maintenance, and training services after the warranty period from the contracts has ended. 

Ok, I kind of get it. So why should I be interested?

1. **An Impeccable Balance Sheet:** After paying off its 20M convertible bond in Q1 of FY20, the company has total debt of only 2.5M. That’s good for a D/E ratio of 0.003, quite a bit lower than the 0.557 average of its competitors. It’s average OCF margin over the last three years is 19%, well above industry averages, and its average CFO/NI ratio over the same period is 0.99.
2. **Urbanization:** Rapid industrialization and warped demographics has manifested in dramatic urbanization and economic integration, which in turn creates a critical need for infrastructure. Grand infrastructure goals are what a planned economy like China does best. While the world awaits the details of the PRC’s 14th Five Year Plan, you can bet HOLI will be busy servicing Chinese needs for high-speed rail and subway transit.
3. **Limited Domestic Competition:** While large multinationals account for the majority of global automation market share, to the extent this is true in China does not extend to the verticals in which Hollysys makes most of its profits. Specifically, the high barriers to entry for servicing nuclear power plants and high-speed rail gives the company an enviable moat around a significant portion of its revenue share. 

***Valuation***

Currently, HOLI’s sustainable competitive advantage comes from its specialized offerings of high-speed rail signaling systems to ensure the safety of passenger train movement. The China Train Control System (CTCS) is a country specific high-speed rail standard and therefore is different from international standards propounded by European organizations or Japan. This barrier to entry makes HOLI the largest provider in a growing market. In fact, their 39% market share from 2015-2018 for total automatic train protection (ATP) sets sold made them the largest Chinese company in the domestic automation market. Rail is also the division in which the company has its highest profit margins.

HOLI’s revenue comes from three main offerings: IA, Rail, and M&E. Historically, the revenue share between the three divisions has been very stable: 40%, 36%, and 23%, respectively. In 2019 and 2018, the company had a GP% of 37% and 38%. Over those two years, IA posted a GP% of 41% and 40% while Rail posted a GP% of 48% and 52%. M&E were by far its lowest margin operations with a GP% of 13% both years. The company does not provide revenue figures by geographical area for each division, but it does break out total revenues by geographical area. We can infer from this breakout and from other financial and marketing materials that almost all IA and Rail revenue is derived from business in the PRC while M&E revenue is generated from its foreign subsidiaries in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Middle East. 

China’s high-speed railway operating mileage, currently the largest in the world, has grown from 19,000km in 2016 to 32,000km at the end of 2019, covering 80% of China’s major cities and surpassing the 30,000km goal by 2020 laid out under the 13th Five Year Plan. Though the details of infrastructure goals won’t be released until the next five year plan in 2021, high-speed rail is expected to be at least a $4.4 billion industry by 2023, with maintenance and replacement accounting for a rapidly growing share of expenditures. Higher growth is expected in the urban rail transit sector, which is expected to grow from 5,500km to 9,276km by 2023. In general, infrastructure needs are driven by the rapid urbanization and regional economic integration and is supported by ambitious policies such as the five year plans, Eight Horizontal and Eight Vertical High-speed Railway Corridors project, and the Belt and Road Initiatives. With its leading market share in these industries, HOLI is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. ­

China’s industrial automation market is similarly poised for accelerated growth. Total contract amount from industrial automation in China grew at a 4.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2014 to 2018 and reached a total value of $30.1 billion. The market is estimated to accelerate that growth to 11.1% CAGR from 2018 to 2023 and reach $50.6 billion. Over that same time, petrochemicals and power are expected to grow at CAGRs of 14.5% and 5.8%, respectively. While competition in the industrial automation market is stiffer, HOLI’s roots in automation for power and petrochemicals, growing name brand recognition in China, advanced technology, and cash-rich position give it a good position to increase its market share. Importantly, HOLI has a unique advantage when it comes to nuclear power. 

The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster threw a major wrench into China’s plans for nuclear power. To reassure the population that the country was not a risk of a similar catastrophe, the PRC placed a moratorium on the construction of new power plants. After lifting that ban in 2019, the country has 47 nuclear reactors in commercial operation, with twelve more under constructions and more on the way. The impetus for nuclear power in China has increased due to air pollution from coal-fired plants and as a result the country has subsidized nuclear power with an aim to match and surpass the world average of 15% for total electricity generated by nuclear power (currently at 4.75%). HOLI is the only qualified local automation and control product provider to the non-safety control for nuclear power stations. In the nuclear automation segment, HOLI competes with multi-national corporations such as Siemens, Areva, and Invensys, but with the abnormal glut in demand created by the Fukushima disaster HOLI has a prime opportunity to increase its market share.

The M&E division offers solutions through Concord and Bond Groups, two subsidiaries acquired by HOLI in 2011 and 2013, respectively, in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Hong Kong. While this division has the lowest revenue and profit margins in relation to the company’s other operations, it also offers its greatest opportunity for business expansion and diversification. A 2019 partnering with the London engineering consulting firm Arup signals a willingness to expand the M&E offerings, potentially through more acquisitions. While profitable, the revenues generated by this division do not significantly affect our valuation of the company. Barring any interesting acquisitions, the only growth we forecast for M&E is over the long-term.

An important measure in our valuation comes from HOLI’s dedication to research and development. Historically, the company spends 6-7% of revenue on R&D, and 40%, or 1,500 employees, of the 3,200 person company work in R&D. Their proprietary technology is at the center of their rail and power offerings – as of June 30, 2019, HOLI held 221 software copyrights, 126 authorized patents, 64 pending patent applications, and 44 registered trademarks. The Chairman and CEO, Shao Baiqing, has been with the company for more than 25 years starting as one of the founding engineers, and “is widely regarded as an industry leader with significant influence in China.” 

Despite the fact that EBITDA has grown over 60% since FY17, HOLI has an EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 3.  Not only is this well below the historical multiple for the company, it is also low enough to be a solid multiple for a coal company. Taking into account the growing industrial automation and high-speed transit sectors in China, while accounting for some slowdown in infrastructure spending in the current year as the window of the 12th Five Year Plan is closing having already surpassed expected rail mileage, we use a conservative estimate of 5% revenue growth rate YoY. We see no reason for net income growth to lag behind this rate. Using consistent conservative estimates to project unlevered free cash flow, and re-levering the beta to reflect average competitor beta, we arrive at a fair value of $25 per share, close to a 60% discount rate.

* Escalations by either the U.S. or China in their trade war could negatively affect trade relations or may cause further slowdowns in Chinese economic growth and depreciation of the RMB. This has the potential to adversely impact HOLI’s supply chain for its products and stifle the demand for capital projects and domestic investment in China.

**Introduction**

Banca Sistema SpA (BST.MI) is an Italian small specialty bank, providing factoring services to suppliers of public administrations (64% of the company’s outstanding loan volume), salary and pension secured loans (31% of outstanding loan volume), as well as gold and jewelry backed loans. The company’s business segments are characterized by low risk (36 bps cost of risk) and relatively high returns (18% ROTCE). Total outstanding loan volume exceeds €2.6 billion.

Interests of shareholders and management are seemingly well aligned, with management owning a significant portion of the company. The ownership structure looks as follows: 38.4% of the company is owned by a shareholder’s agreement comprised of two banking Foundations (collectively 15.3%) and SGBS (23.1%), of which Gianluca Garbi, the CEO of the company, is the relative majority shareholder. The remaining shares (61.6%) are floating.[ Mr. Garbi acquired an additional 170,000 shares in June of 2019 at a price of around €1.14](https://bancasistema.it/pdf/internal_dealing/20190618_1501_Comunicazione_id_garbi.pdf), when the stock was near its all-time low to date. Other insiders have bought in August at prices between €1.25 and €1.30.

Since the stock was floated at the Borsa Italiana in 2015, Banca Sistema SpA has grown its assets by 75%, from €2 billion in 2016 to €3.7 billion in 2019. The profitability has been stable and growing, with net income of €26.4 million in 2016 and €29.7 million in 2019. Meanwhile, the stock price has fallen from €3.75 to around €1.90 during the same time period. For full year 2019, the company has managed to grow earnings by 9% and maintain a ROE above 18%, while being overcapitalized by more than €80 million on a pro forma basis. Evidently, there’s a divergence between fundamentals and stock price development, creating a bargain opportunity at low multiples of 5.14x earnings and 0.88x tangible book value.

**The Main Business – Factoring**

Factoring of receivables towards Italian public administration entities is the main business segment of Banca Sistema SpA. Customers are utilities and companies, who provide healthcare products and services, food, transport and entertainment to local state-owned healthcare companies, regions, municipalities and ministries. Due to structural reasons (bureaucracy as well as liquidity), Italian PAs are significantly slower to pay their open invoices than the EU average. In fact, out of all the EU countries,[ only Greece is slower to pay](https://www.intrum.com/media/5755/intrum-epr-2019.pdf).

[Source: European Payment Report 2019](https://preview.redd.it/7blcht8fi9i41.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=68fae5de7da97029427dce5c37f34ef15b53150f)

Although payment times have come down in 2019, it’s questionable how sustainable this new level is. Greece had improved its average payment time from[ 103 days in 2017 to 73 days in 2018, just to see it increase back to 115 days in 2019](https://www.intrum.com/media/5755/intrum-epr-2019.pdf). The reasons for these late payments are deeply rooted structural issues that have persisted for a long time. They will unlikely be solved overnight.

The profitability of the business comes from the ability to collect the purchased receivables faster and/or recover a higher value than the original creditor expected. The data driven underwriting is based on information about payment times from past collections with different public administrations. The company’s proprietary tools and comprehensive data basis are constantly fed with new data and enable them to effectively price receivables for profit. Payment times are accelerated by established relationships with key people at the PAs. 

The key particularity about this business is that the vast majority (84%) of obligors are public administrations; a reference market without default risk. Although payment time can be further delayed, if PAs enter into financial distress, the exposure to credit risk is not a concern, because public administration entities can’t default and are not subject to Italian bankruptcy laws. As long as the company doesn’t accept any haircut proposal, a full recovery of both capital and interest at the end of the financial distress is possible. There is only a time value effect due to the longer collection process.

The majority of factoring turnover of Banca Sistema SpA is non-recourse (62%), with recourse factoring representing 11% and tax receivables 27%.

**Favorable Market Backdrop and Legal Framework**

1. European Late Payment Directive (2011/7/EU)

To protect European businesses, particularly SMEs, against late payment, the EU adopted Directive 2011/7/EU on combating late payment in commercial transactions in February 2011.

Under this directive public authorities have to pay for the goods and services that they procure within 30 days or, in very exceptional circumstances, within 60 days. Companies are legally entitled to late payment interest from the day following the terms of contractual payment at a statutory interest of 8% above the ECB reference rate.

The late payment interest ([LPI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LPI)) is an incentive for the counterparty to pay the debt in time and negotiation lever for the company to get accelerated payment. If the payment is overdue, the LPI is accrued and eventually collected after legal action. For 2019, LPI from legal action has made up 36% of factoring interest income.

2. VAT Split Payment System

In January 2015, the Italian government first implemented the split payment method of VAT collection to combat VAT fraud and non-compliance, which has been extended since. In this system, VAT due from goods and services provided to public entities are directly paid to the Italian treasury and not the supplier.

The split payment method generates liquidity problems for public administration suppliers, as they find themselves in a permanent VAT credit position on transactions made with public entities. Companies subject to split payment continue to pay VAT to its suppliers, but no longer receives it from its customers, who pay the tax directly to the state. This mechanism creates an imbalance of incoming and outgoing cash flows, further amplified by the delays in obtaining VAT refunds, which, on average, takes 95 days. The increased volume of requests for VAT refunds that can now be filed quarterly to reduce the negative financial impact, is expected to lead to further payment delays. The total expected business opportunity for factoring providers created by the split payment system is estimated to be around €15 billion, according to a study by Bain & Company.

3. Growth of Government Spending

The European Commission’s spring 2019 forecast revealed that Italy will be the slowest growing economy in the EU during 2019. Technically, the country was in a recession in 2018, with two back to back quarters of negative GDP growth. With monetary policy being exhausted as a means to accelerate economic growth in the country, Italy has to turn to fiscal policy in order to support its economy. Italian government spending is projected to increase by almost €100 billion, or 2% per year, over the next five years, from €864 billion in 2019, to €957 billion in 2024. Government revenues are projected to increase roughly in line with spending[(€921 billion in 2024](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/italy/forecast-government-revenue)). Thus, even with no GDP growth (€2.076 trillion GDP in 2018), the projections do not imply a breach of the EU’s rules, by which member states are not supposed to run a budget deficit above 3% of its GDP.

[Source: International Monetary Fund – World Economic Outlook](https://preview.redd.it/fjhxsshli9i41.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=497d0ed70513691d23232cca0cc1aeb10afb716d)

The positive effect of increased government spending works in two ways for Banca Sistema SpA. First, more spending means more potential factoring volume in total. Second, more spending can result in higher payment times, because of the increased volume of payments that have to be processed; this in turn should create higher demand for factoring and enable more profitable underwriting (higher margins).

**Salary and Pension Secured Loans (CQ Loans)**

The Bank’s second largest line of business, with 31% of total outstanding turnover, is salary and pension secured loans. Loans outstanding have grown 25% y/y (FY19 vs FY18). It’s a lower margin business compared to factoring, with current net interest margins of 3.3% vs. 5,9% for factoring. However, secured loans are considered very low risk, because the borrower’s loan is repaid directly from their salary or pension by the employer or state pension body. The following attributes are additionally contributing to the low risk profile:

1. the monthly installment can’t exceed 20% of the salary/pension,
2. the loan takes precedence over any seizure of salary/pension amounts, and
3. insurance is mandatory by law and covers in case of death, disability and loss of job.

Moreover, out of the outstanding borrowers 50% are pensioners and 32% are employees of public entities. The probability of default ([PD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PD)) is very low and loss given default (LGD) is almost zero (thanks to the insurance).

Since the recent acquisition of the broker Atlantide, the company is able to originate the CQ loans themselves, instead of relying on intermediaries, like it has in the past. This will increase the net interest margin of the CQ business in the long run, although it might not have an immediate impact, because only 5% of the currently €817 million outstanding CQ loans are originated directly by the company.

**Gold/Jewelry Backed Loans**

The company has first tested this business in 2016 and has grown it organically as well as by way of acquisitions since. The pawn loan is a particular form of short-term loan with a collateral on property goods; the focus is on gold, jewelry, diamonds and selected watch brands. The gold and jewelry backed loans only make up a negligible portion of the total turnover, with €70 million in currently outstanding loans, even considering the recent acquisition of the gold/jewelry backed loan line of Intesa Sanpaolo SpA Group of €60 million in outstanding loans. This is not a business that many banks are focused on. Nonetheless, it’s characterized by very high returns and low capital absorption. The gross annual interest rate on the loans is 12-14% with 50% loan to value. Most pawns are paid back at the expiration date, between 5-8% are sold at auction. The majority of outstanding loans are backed by gold. Management has talked about prospects for double digit annual growth in this business segment in the Q4 2019 earnings call.

**Regulatory Capital Well Above Minimum Requirements**

The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio stands at 11.7% at year-end 2019, compared to the minimum requirement of 7.75%. Total Capital Ratio (TCR) at 15.0%, exceeds required minimum of 11.85% by similar amount.

Moreover, the European regulatory bodies have recently decided to[ reduce the risk weighting of CQ loans to 35% from 75%](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0876&from=EN), starting September 28, 2021. Since the CQ loans business makes up a significant part of the outstanding loans of Banca Sistema, at €817 million or about 42% of risk weighted assets, the new directive has a significant positive impact on the company’s regulatory capital ratios. Once the directive is officially implemented, the CET1 and TCR ratios for Banca Sistema will stand at 13.9% and 17.8%, before accounting for the most recent acquisition of the gold/jewelry backed loans business from Intesa Sanpaolo. In absolute terms, approximately €31 million of capital will be made available, 20% of the current market cap. The total capital surplus will add up to €87 million (pre acquisition), 57% of the current market cap. This large capital surplus makes the stellar returns on equity even more impressive. It will also enable accelerated growth in factoring and loan volume, additional acquisitions or a higher capital distribution to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

**Valuation**

As of my writing, the share price stands at around €1.90. With 80.3 million shares outstanding, the current market cap is €153 million. EPS for full year 2019 was recently reported at €0.37. That gets us to a P/E multiple of 5.14, implying a 19% earnings yield. The acquisition of the gold and jewelry backed loans from Intesa is expected to add approximately €3 million in annual profits, or €0.04 in EPS. Even with zero growth in the other lines of business, next year’s EPS could reasonably come in at €0.41. Based on the current stock price, the multiple on my conservative earnings estimate for 2020 stands at 4.63. That’s cheap by any measure and leaves a margin of safety for some unforeseen risks and uncertainties.

The company is also very cheap in terms of book value. Tangible book value per share for the most recent quarter is €2.16. At the current share price of €1.90, you get a discount to tangible book value, for a company earning a return on tangible equity above 18%.

Putting a more reasonable 10x multiple on net earnings, gets you to a share price of €3.70 on FY19 earnings and €4.10 on my conservative expectations for FY20 earnings. That’s an upside of around 100-130%. Following Warren Buffets logic of valuing J.P. Morgan at 3x tangible book value (18% ROTCE divided by his assessment of risk-free rate of 6% = 3), Banca Sistema should be worth more than 3x the current price.

**Regulatory Risk**

Two new EU regulations could potentially have an impact on Banca Sistema’s factoring business: the[ EBA guidelines on the definition of default](https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/1721448/052c260f-da9a-4c86-8f0a-09a1d8ae56e7/Guidelines%20on%20default%20definition%20%28EBA-GL-2016-07%29_EN.pdf?retry=1) and[ calendar provisioning](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/635553/EPRS_BRI%282019%29635553_EN.pdf). The risks emanating from the new regulations were previously discussed here on Seekingalpha.

Essentially, the regulations change the definition of default and the way the company has to treat its nonperforming exposures. By the new definition credit exposures that are due past 90 days are considered defaulted and have to be written off within 3 to 9 years depending on the type of exposure.

However, for exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector entities, which make up 84% of Banca Sistema’s factoring turnover, special treatment may apply, as long as:

1. the contract is related to the supply of goods and services,
2. the financial situation of the obligor is sound and there are no reasonable concerns that the obligation might not be paid in full,
3. the obligation is past due not longer than 180 days.

Fortunately, all criteria are met for most of Banca Sistema’s public sector exposures, because:

1. factoring receivables from suppliers of goods and services to public administrations is precisely what the company does.
2. PAs can’t default and are not subject to Italian bankruptcy law; thus, there is no concern that the obligation might not be paid in full.
3. the average payment time of Italian PAs was between 67 and 104 days during the last three years, well below 180 days.

From a pragmatic perspective, the change of the definition of default has no impact on the actual collectability of receivables towards public administrations. Bad loans from PA exposure have not led to actual losses for the company. Still, concerns remain that the new regulations will have an impact on the accounting (in terms of provisioning and write-offs) as well as the regulatory capital requirements, which could adversely impact returns on equity or even necessitate a capital increase, diluting current shareholders.

Meanwhile, the CEO has stated that the impact of the new regulation is very limited, if not zero, on the most recent Q4 2019 conference call. Although I’d normally be hesitant to take managements word at face value, the high insider ownership and further acquisition of shares, gives me a higher level of comfort.

**Why This Opportunity Exists**

Banca Sistema is a small, relatively illiquid, Italian bank stock. There are multiple factors depressing the current share price.

First, the European financial sector couldn’t be more hated by investors. The increased regulatory requirements since the Great Financial Crisis, paired with the sustained unfavorable interest rate environment in Europe, have greatly reduced the returns on equity European banks are able to generate. A traditional European bank is happy to earn 9% ROE these days. Banca Sistema has thus far been able to earn more than 18% ROE, in the same regulatory and interest rate environment, running a significant capital surplus. This is one of those cases, where the baby is thrown out with the bath water, creating an opportunity for the attentive investor.

Second, Italy has had its fair share of bad headlines in recent years: government crisis, low economic growth and a large government debt burden have weighed on Italian stock prices. Unsurprisingly, Banca Sistema hit its all-time low of €1.10 per share, in June of 2019, at the height of the government crisis.

Third, small cap value stocks, as a group, have had a historically bad run in recent years. The relative underperformance of small cap value has only been more extreme in 1929, right before the Great Depression, and in 1999, at the very top of the Tech Bubble. In the current environment, companies like Banca Sistema tend to stay undervalued for a while, and in many cases, continue to fall further and further in price, as funds get drawn out of value strategies and get reallocated to strategies that have performed best in the most recent past. With capital continuing to flow into ETFs, companies that are not included in the prominent indices lag behind the largest capitalization stocks - the biggest beneficiaries of the inflows, who move along the fund flows seemingly irrespective of fundamentals.

**Conclusion**

Over the long run, fundamentals matter; share price and value tend to converge and major mispricings are corrected. The catalysts can either be abrupt, like a private buyout or a large share repurchase, or more gradual, like continued showings of good business fundamentals and high shareholder yield over time.

I think the latter is more likely for Banca Sistema, although a buyout or some other M&A event is certainly not out of the realm of possibilities. If the company continues to prove its earnings power over the long term, compounding its equity at a high rate, the stock price will eventually meet its intrinsic value. In the meantime, you’ll receive a decent dividend yield of around 5%, at a conservative payout ratio of just 25%. This is the type of company that I wouldn’t mind owning even if I couldn’t get a quote on my shares for the next 10 years. Your incentives are aligned with Gianluca Garbi, the CEO and single largest shareholder, who presumably has the majority of his net worth tied up in the company. He has every incentive to not only run the company well operationally, but to also eventually bring share price and value into alignment, if the gap doesn’t close organically over time.",47,0.9,1582284596,"[['LPI', 2]]",LPI,28.600000381469727,22.399999618530273
t3_fc7dt6,Preferred stock opportunities?,"Preferred stocks have been trading at low yields given the low interest rates. PGF, PFF and PGX are the obvious ETFs. They only yield around 5% to 5.5%+, which is quite low compared to high yield bonds, though preferreds from IG (bank) credits may be better than HY bonds.

Instead, I've been looking at some of the more small issuers from smaller sectors (REITs, BDCs, shipping). Some names have traded down quite a bit with the recent market volatility, particularly as liquidity is thin in most of these names. Yields continue to be low in a lot of the names for the amount of risk, which makes sense, but I think there could be some value.

With the interest rates at new lows, does an allocation to these lower-grade preferreds make sense now? Any preferreds you are holding or looking at?

I do see that some preferreds in these sectors come with some really unique structures (fixed-to-float, explicit maturity, step-up in coupon (possibly acting as ""soft"" maturity), board member right if not redeemed in X years, etc.). Many of these are likely used to entice investors in small issuers with sketchy balance sheets. But in some ways, some preferreds may have structural protection that make them almost bond-like.

t3_fewwgq,Its just a flu bro,"Now that I got your attention with this catchy title, allow me to make the argument that this new corona virus is presenting us with the buying opportunity only seen once a decade or so. With travel and energy related stocks selling off like the next recession will happen, I think it is worth estimating how bad this new corona virus really is. 

So far people are freaking about CFR (mortality rate), and comparing early estimates in China of 2.3% with regular flu, which is closer to 0.1%. The Spanish Flu had a mortality rate of around 2% as well.

I will give some reasons why both early Covid-19 mortality rate is overstated, and why flu mortality rate would be understated if it was discovered today.

**Comparing different types of data sets**

First let us look at flu data here:

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm

As you can see in 2017/2018, CFR for flu was actually 0.15% (see second table). But this was for all estimated cases! This seems to hover between 0.10-0.16%. 

Now deaths are far more unlikely to go unreported than mild or asymptomatic cases. Because death is generally preceded by severe symptoms.  Especially since mild symptoms resemble regular cold symptoms so much.

Note that if influenza were just discovered, most of the reported cases would probably be hospital visits. And most of the vulnerable people would go to the hospital first. And CFR could easily be several % as well then.

Current data for the covid-19 virus is confirmed deaths/confirmed cases. And this does not include estimated cases! For example by large scale anti body testing you can estimate real amount of flu infections. These tests are not available yet for covid-19.

Now let's look at age. A sample of 42k cases in China shows that only about 2% are under 18.

https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf

And what is interesting is that outside Hubei (where much more random testing has happened, with much less incentive to cover it up), CFR was only 0.4% over 11k cases. (see page 4 of that report on top).

What is CFR for influenza for people over 18? 0.26%! And actually 42% of underage people got regular flu.

On top of that, only 1% was found to be asymptomatic in the Chinese data set, with a much higher % for regular flu (about 20%). And in this Korean sample about 26% of total infected was asymptomatic (where much more random testing happened):

https://twitter.com/BBCLBicker/status/1233701679586922498

Speaking about Korean sample, only 5% of infected were 18 or younger. For regular flu, this group is the one with a mortality rate of almost 0% (so far not much different among small group of underage with covid-19 virus).

source: http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200303000714

Currently CFR in Korea is 0.68% with only 0.5% in critical condition:

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

With almost 180k people tested, of which about 3.7% were found to be infected:

https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030

So if we adjusted, and divided 0.68% by 1.6 (since about 40% of regular flu patients are under 18), we get a CFR of 0.42%. Not that different from the CFR for regular flu of 0.26%.

If you adjust for vaccinations (which are not yet available for this virus), CFR starts to look pretty similar.

**What about Italy?**

Well, they are not testing on a large scale in Italy, only 23k tested yet, with more than 10x number of critical patients vs Korea. They are not testing people the infected have been in contact with. And are not doing much to contain it. And as of a couple days ago, all deaths were older than 55, and most were even older than that with underlying conditions. This is similar to the regular flu, where CFR goes up exponentially past age of 60:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/italy-elderly-population-coronavirus-risk-covid-19

>The virus has killed 79 people in Italy, overwhelmingly aged between 63 and 95 with underlying serious illnesses.

>The youngest patient to die was 55 and suffering from chronic disease.


So one thing that stuck out in past epidemics, is the large number of younger people (especially in 20-50 age range) that got killed. Especially in the Spanish flu, but also in the 1957 and 1968 outbreak. So far looking at data, this is not the case for this particular strain. 

**Mortality rate among old people**

Mortality rate among people 65+ in the Chinese data set (which I find highly questionable, since majority is Wuhan cases and CFR is so much higher vs Korean and Diamond Princess data set) has average mortality rate of 8% in 65+ demographic. This compares to a 65+ mortality rate of 0.8% with regular flu.

BUT this includes vaccinations for regular flu (a large majority of 65+ people vaccinate). Which lessens symptoms and prevents altogether. And it excludes asymptomatic cases. 

And the Diamond Princess data set (which is more reliable since they were isolated and entire population was tested regardless of symptoms, and there were no Chinese communist party officials invovled) actually suggests much lower mortality rates:

https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html

>The data from the Diamond Princess suggest an eightfold lower mortality amongst patients older than 70 and threefold lower mortality in patients over 80 compared to what was reported in China initially. 

An 8 fold lower CFR for 70+ would mean roughly a 1.1% CFR for 70+. Which seems to be in line with regular flu? And this is without a vaccine, and in sub optimal cramped conditions!

And what is worth mentioning:

>Not a single Diamond Princess patient under age 70 has died. 

Out of almost 700.

**Weather**

So if you look at a [weather map](https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1&o1=ro&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FwxnrGsv-B3urh9HEnOadek7D3QuCSV6Eflh9P4-kR_s.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D71c2438ae2184fb01780e76c9719e87ba25c590f) you will see that there is not a single warm country where the virus has spread aggressively (note that Iran is mostly green on that map). I would think tens of thousands of cases would be hard to cover up.

Millions of Chinese have traveled to Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Africa, and there are barely any cases in those countries.

This seems to line up with regular flu which largely recedes in warm weather for various reasons.

[Note amount of flu cases by month in US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness#/media/File:WhoLab15.GIF). We are now going into week 11 this year. So that means roughly 4 more vulnerable weeks, but growth rates of how this spreads should go down rapidly in next 2 months. Which gives time to find a vaccine. And time to analyze data and get a more complete picture of CFR (which is much more likely to go down than up). 

**implication for investing**

Well the implication here is that this will likely be a non event in the coming year. In summer most cases likely go away, and panic largely recedes. Maybe a couple of months of disruptions, but my guess is that the general public will figure out what I have just outlined in my post in the coming months. And when that happens, equities are likely to snap back up. Especially stocks in risk areas. And people will just continue going about their day. Given how far some stocks have fallen, I would think this presents a pretty amazing investment opportunity.",89,0.72,1583596295,"[['CFR', 14]]",CFR,50.16999816894531,60.900001525878906
t3_fequ1v,Liquidation Value of Stelco,"I was calculating a liquidation value of Stelco and I wanted to confirm my understanding and to see if there is anything I am missing.

Stelco is an integrated steel mill that came out of bankruptcy within the past decade. Because they purchase a lot of bankrupt assets, the historical cost of their assets are well below the fair market value of the assets. Specifically, I want to turn your attention to the land they own and operate on.

When calculating the fair market value of the land, I used the CBRE Q4 2019 report and took the average net sale price per sqft for industrial land in London, Ontsrio. As someone who lives in Ontario, I can confidentially say that using the industrial sale price of London land as a comparable for Hamilton is very conservative. I have calculated the following:

$75 for the average net sale price per sqft x 800 acres of land they own x 43,560 (acres to sqft) = $2.6 billion - $1.144 billion of total liabilities = $1.47 billion of liquidation value

The company is trading for $6.60 or $600 million. It is trading for less than half of its liquidation value.

I didn't even place any value on the cash and other assets it owns, and I didn't take into account the competent CEO Alan Kastenbaum. Also, they still operate a profitable steel mill, which means that the liquidation value will not be diluted.

Chimera had already granted the executives their yearly awards in January and February but then decided to make a 3rd grant in March (which has never been done before), with no explanation, and at prices 55% below their stock price just 1 month ago (and below their closing price on March 18th, the day the awards were granted).

From [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cim?ltr=1):

First things first, like many companies, Chimera has been crushed by the market over the last month (-55%). They also were having an extremely rough day on March 18th with the stock bottoming out at $6.50, 47% below the opening price.

Stock grants on their own aren’t unusual, but it is unusual to grant stock for a 3rd time in Q1 when the company has never done that before and is near its all-time low. Looking at Matthew Lambiase’s (CEO) [grants](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getowner&CIK=0001419165) for the last few years, we see that he (and the other executives) typically receive stock grants in either January or February (or both) but never in March.

Digging a little deeper into the awards, we find that everyone except the Chief Legal Officer received pretty substantial 6-figure award amounts. With the closing price on March 18th being $9.98, these executives/directors also received some pretty nice discounts on their grants.

However, as the table below shows, all of them are well above their required holdings except for the Chief Legal Officer who is substantially below his requirements. However, they gave the Chief Legal Officer much less stock than everyone else and not nearly enough to put him over his requirements (we did not include the stock they were just granted on March 18th and made the stock price the same as their grant price). While it is possible that they were granting this stock to ensure that all of the executives and directors stay above their ownership requirements, it seems highly unlikely.

## Conclusion

These stock grants check a lot of boxes for an “unusual award”. The executives had already received their yearly rewards, they gave no explanation for this award, they granted the stock near the lowest prices possible, and the awards weren’t necessary to push the executives over their ownership guidelines.

There is the possibility that this is them just putting on a show to try to prevent their stock from declining further, but it would be a fairly pricey show especially when you consider the $155M of share repurchases they are doing.

Another, potentially more likely, possibility is that the company and executives believe the stock is undervalued and they are grabbing the stock at a discount.

t3_flavme,Carmax (KMX) Short Thesis,"Sorry for the poor formatting. I'm a Finance major who had his semester cut short. I'm doing this write up on Carmax ticker(KMX) as just a little practice putting my thoughts into words. I know my sources and stuff should be formatted better. All data related to Carmax was taken from the EDGAR database form 10-K related to fiscal year 2018.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional advisor and all decisions are your own. I have a current short KMX position. 

There is currently a liquidity crunch happening in financial markets that is causing massive sell offs in all asset classes. Today 3/18 we saw bonds, commodities, and equities all take steep losses as investors race for cash. The Federal reserve has been injecting liquidity into repo markets for the last few months. This is significant because banks and other institutions can’t get enough cash. We’ve also seen many companies start to draw down their credit lines even if they don’t need it yet because many are forecasting tough times ahead and see increasing demand, so they want to secure their slice now. Cruise lines, amusement parks, airlines, and many more industries impacted by the spread of Novel Coronavirus will be relying on credit to survive and will make it more difficult for the regular credit market to function as they take on more and more debt and take liquidity out of the market. 

What’s even worse is safety measures are causing large disruptions in the global economy. China, a global growth leader, is predicting a contraction in Q1 2020. U.S GDP growth is mostly fueled by the service sector which is being hit the hardest by “social distancing”. According to Forbes 78% of American workers live paycheck to paycheck. https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/01/11/live-paycheck-to-paycheck-government-shutdown/#22d7cad14f10 Now even regular citizens are going to feel the effect of this liquidity crunch.

This means after this week most Americans will be surviving on credit and any assistance congress provides which won’t be much. The priorities of the American worker will be for rent, food, and other necessities which is apparently toilet paper. A car would already be at the bottom of the payments list in hard times, but now Americans won’t even need it to get to work since they can’t leave their houses.


Now for a little background on why this is significant. Auto manufacturers recovering from the Great Recession in 2008 had to find a way to boost new auto sales. The easy money offered by quantitative easing made this possible. However, banks after 2008 were more cautious/constrained by government rules. Instead the origination of these loans shifted to the Finance sector notably these large auto manufacturers in-house financing arms. 
50% of these loans originated by these in-house financing divisions are sub-prime! https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2019/02/21/debunking-the-auto-loan-delinquency-crisis/#44443ed312f8 

This comes from the ironically titled Forbes article “Debunking the Auto Loan Delinquency ‘Crisis’”. “While it's true that 50% of auto finance companies' loans go to sub-prime borrowers (who have higher default rates), overall those lenders account for just 12% of all outstanding auto loan balances, and just 26% of the outstanding loans to sub-prime borrowers.” That means 50% of their loans are sub-prime and that only accounts for 26% of the sub-prime loans in the market. Ron Shevlin then goes on to talk about the uptick is in defaults is relatively inconsequential as delinquency rates are still relatively low even in sub-prime during the largest and longest expansion in recent memory, but they’re still rising. An argument can be made these lenders can afford to make riskier loans because this isn’t like the mortgage crisis, cars are easy to repossess and sell wholesale to recoup losses and these people need their cars for work, family, etc.

We have people making six figures that are in debt up to their eyeballs with no cash reserves to fall back on and a $60,000 truck they have to make payments on every month. (Anecdotal)




Now back to why this is all relevant. As Americans start to feel the effect of the liquidity crunch, layoffs, and overall contraction from the Coronavirus, what will be one of the first bills they stop paying during stressful financial times when they are stuck at home anyway? Their auto loans. Not even just sub-prime, they’ve been making poor loans to people for years and remember 78% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck at the height of U.S economic expansion and lowest unemployment in recent memory. Not to mention in February 2019 this happened. 
https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/auto-loan-delinquencies-rise/ 

“Auto loan delinquencies surge past Great Recession rate” This is while things were still good. It’s important to note this is backwards looking at 2018 Q4. The rise in subprime auto loan delinquency has been coming for awhile behind the scenes. This is demonstrated in this statistic showing that 90+ day delinquencies have been on the rise since bottoming out at 3.37% in 2015. 
https://www.statista.com/statistics/681294/share-of-90-delinquent-auto-loan-balances-usa/ 

The 4.47% in 2018 is .53% higher than 2008 and only slightly lower than the 4.92% in 2009.
What happens now when this wave of auto defaults take place? Well first of all its going to be huge seeing as Americans have over 1.2 Trillion is auto loan debt in February 2020 according to Investopedia. It is 10% of household debt which is third by size behind only mortgages (which we know can have huge upticks in delinquency rates) and student loans. 
https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/american-debt-auto-loan-debt/ 
Whoever owns these loans whether it’s the financing division at these auto manufacturers or investors in asset backed securities are going to experience drastic delinquency rates. So, they are going to repossess all of these cars at the same time. Now they are going to be dumping supply into the used car market creating greater losses for themselves as demand slows at exactly the same time. 

The largest purchasers of these repossessed cars and cars coming off lease are at auction from big used car sales lots. The biggest publicly traded example is Carmax, Inc. (KMX). Who has been working with Net Income percentages under 5% for the last 3 years and at 3.9% for 2016 and 2017 and 4.6% in 2018. 
Carmax utilizes the same system to sell their cars by financing sub-prime auto loans. Only its worse because the creditworthiness of these customers is even worse. The company may seem cushioned by its Total Assets of $18.7 billion and Total Liabilities of $15.35 billion. Until it’s acknowledged that $12.43 billion of those assets are receivables on auto loans and they hold $14.2 billion in debt on their balance sheet. Not to mention that the $12.43 billion book value on their loans will be severely impaired when the value of these cars on their lots starts to plummet as the default wave intensifies and they are forced to write down receivables values. Also, these big sellers have no one to wholesale their cars to after, they’re the usual buyers. Couple this with slowing demand, a drastic spike in supply, and their tight profit margins and it is looking very bleak. 
Free cash flows are already very low for Carmax. Cash flows from the operating activities have been negative in 2016 and 2017 which means they’re not even getting any liquidity from their auto sales. All of the cash comes in from the financing activities which will be the first to dry up. Then more debt must be taken on to stay afloat. But there is already $14.2 billion in debt on the balance sheet . And of the 18 billion in assets they have $14.95 billion in assets is based on the book value of these autos that are sure to decline during economic hardship especially after a wave of auto loan defaults that immediately lower their value and saturate the market further depressing used car values and impairments to the balance sheet. 

Carmax only has a market capitalization of 7.878 billion but 15 billion in debt and highly vulnerable assets there is a significant bankruptcy risk here. The free cash flow to debt ratio is 40,479,000/14,447,669,000 = .0028018. Not exactly what you’re looking for in the middle of a liquidity/credit crisis.

t3_fn8s0r,BDC Baby Bonds [A long thesis write-up on CSWCL],"I've been looking at baby bonds for the past week or two in this sell-off... thought I'd post my thoughts below. Part of a write-up I submitted in a VIC application. While this focuses on one specific security, the sell-off has provided opportunities for a number of BDCs that have good asset coverage and higher quality portfolios.

----------------

Capital Southwest is a business development company (“BDC”) that focuses on lower middle market businesses with <$15m of EBITDA. I will not go into detail on BDCs or how they work, as this is information that is readily available online. The business is publicly traded (“CSWC”) and has publicly traded baby bonds (“CSWCL”). The baby bonds, which are used in conjunction with a revolver to fund investments, have a 5.95% coupon and mature in December 2022.

The broad market sell-off in recent weeks has provided numerous opportunities across sectors, and one interesting space has been yield-driven investments such as BDCs. Not only have the equity markets in this space fallen off in a flight to safety, but so too have the publicly traded bonds. The high level thinking makes sense: 1. investors in fixed income funds and ETFs are selling, creating outflows and mandatory redemptions; 2. yield-based investors feel the go-forward dividends in BDCs are unsustainable; 3. BDCs are often exposed to riskier, smaller businesses that are less likely to survive the coming months.

Numerous BDCs have seen their baby bonds drop into the $15-20 range ($25 par), inferring an impaired expected recovery value between 60 and 80 cents on the dollar. For more levered BDCs, the valuation is reasonable after factoring in a 20-30% haircut to the portfolio fair value and performing a waterfall analysis. But for conservative balance sheets, such as Capital Southwest’s, the sell-off is overstated.

As of 12/31/19, Capital Southwest has $500m of investments (excluding its JV with Main Street) and $273m of total long-term debt, for an asset coverage of over 180%. Further, it’s a high quality portfolio: 74% of its assets are first lien paper and the industry exposure to coronavirus high impact areas is limited. Consumer industries, restaurants and energy represent 14% of the book. Most of its portfolio is comprised of business services, healthcare services, media, software and financial services, which are more insulated from consumer-related cyclicality. The capital structure is comprised of a $124m senior revolver and two subordinated baby bond issuances ($76m 2022 and $73m 2024).

So the crux of the analysis is this: in a performing market, these bonds will be valued at par. This clearly is not a performing market, but let’s look under the hood. As a debt investor by nature, conservatism is the name of the game. So let’s look at a few scenarios:

1. A 70% recovery on its first lien loans, 50% recovery on its second lien/subordinated, and 0% on equity gives us an asset fair value of $310m, plus $23m of cash, well in excess of the last debt dollar of $273m, implying a full recovery for the baby bonds.

2. A 50% recovery on the entirety of the portfolio yields a $273m valuation ($250m+$23m cash), or ~100cents on the dollar. This is still a premium over the current trading price of $20 per share. Moreover, this is quite a pessimistic case considering most investments are first lien and being lent at 3-4x. There aren’t too many businesses out there that, if sold, would fetch <3-4x, leading me to believe that these first lien investments would still recovery most of their principal should the underlying businesses be sold.

3. Precedent transaction. In 2009, Patriot Capital Funding was under significant distress and faced a capital call from its lender. It elected to sell to Prospect Capital for $197 million, or 75% of the investment portfolio fair value. This not only resulted in 100% recovery rate for the debt holders ($110.5m outstanding), but also generated returns for the equity holders!


So in short, we are looking at a 6% coupon with 25% additional capital upside over 2.5 years. That’s a 16% IRR with what I believe is minimal downside based on the cases outlined above. It would take significant fair value erosion (>50%) to the underlying investment portfolio for a loss of capital to baby bond holders.

Risk Areas:

- The baby bonds are unsecured and junior to the revolver, meaning that they have fewer protections and are repaid after the revolver in any forced liquidation. There are asset coverage tests in place that could be tripped in the event of a significant portfolio mark-down. The current test is 150%, or 66.7% debt to fair value. A forced liquidation, while unlikely, could result in firesale prices below a reasonable recovery amount.

- Refinance risk. BDCs rely on debt to fund investments, so there’s a risk they cannot refinance this debt when it comes due in Dec 22 if performance continues to suffer.

- Manager underperformance – capital erosion from poor investment decision making over time.

- Coronavirus causing a >50% haircut to portfolio.

Catalysts:

1. Tender offer. BDCs may issue tender offers to repurchase these notes at a discount to book an immediate realized gain if they have excess cash on hand. Prospect Capital announced one last week. While this may not provide full upside as a redemption at face, it is a potential catalyst for upside.

2. Upcoming 10-Q reporting in coming weeks. The FV marks for many BDCs will serve as re-pricing opportunities for their stocks and bonds.

3. General portfolio performance over 2020/2021. These bonds are due at the end of 2022, <3 years from now, which is a natural catalyst in itself. If they are not refinanced before then, I would expect that the price would trade back to par at some point within the next two years as the coronavirus situation plays out and its impact to fair value is known.",6,0.76,1584916669,"[['BDC', 1], ['IRR', 1]]",BDC,28.520000457763672,36.84000015258789
t3_fnl2zl,My View on Weyerhaeuser ($WY),"There's blood in the water these days and I've been itching to get back into active investing. Deals are everywhere and I wanted to share one that I've personally acted on with y'all!

**DISCLAIMER: I have a long position in $WY & the stuff below is just my opinion, not actual investing or financial advice.**

So Weyerhaeuser is a vertically integrated timberlands REIT. Their business is acquiring, managing, and cultivating timberlands to sell directly to manufacturers of wood products or manufacture wood products themselves. In terms of scale, [they're the largest by nearly 6x in acreage](https://www.statista.com/statistics/623363/leading-timberland-owners-in-the-united-states-by-land-ownership/) \- $RYN is a far second. I believe this is quite valuable as wood is a commodity and keeping costs down is key to profitability and $WY's scale can be viewed a competitive advantage.

Over the past five years the company has been doing roughly $1B in CFO annually and is currently trading at \~$11B market cap. Their stock price has dipped 50% from Feb 21st - Mar 20th - mostly because they do depend heavily on the health of the US economy (specifically residential real estate activity) for their business.

Although the dip is expected, I believe the market might have overreacted here. My underlying macro thesis is that COVID-19 is an unforeseen shock, but one that doesn't affect the underlying factors of economic production. If you look at the three main factors (labor, capital stock, and productivity), I believe only labor will be affected. And marginally at that via young folks with underlying medical conditions. The other [major risk group (seniors 65+)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm) could effectively be considered already out of the labor force.

Even if we assume that the next two years will be $0 or negative cash flows, the majority of the value will still be captured in the ongoing business which has demonstrated a pre-COVID potential of $1B in CFO. Now - will it be ongoing? Well...

The big risk I see for the company is that their balance sheet leaves something to be desired. They have roughly $6.1B in debt with only $140M in cash. They also have a rough historical interest rate on debt of 6% and the first big principal repayment is coming up in 2021. If they can't refinance the debt or deal with the interest payments as a result of a prolonged recession, then they are in serious trouble.

But will a prolonged recession come to pass? My bet is no. People are definitely talking about it now, but as I mentioned above - the effects of COVID on the economy should be short-run. However, if people believe a recession is coming, then they may shift from consumption / investment to saving prematurely thereby triggering an actual recession.

It's a big assumption to make, but one that I'm comfortable with.

t3_fq680z,Interest rates and their effect on equity valuations,"tl;dr at the bottom. I also tried to break the post up into logical sections. 

So this is sort of a follow up to the question I posed yesterday asking kind of the 'how and why' we got to this point of ultra low interest rate environment: [Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/fpjbcs/what_has_caused_the_fed_fund_rate_to_decline_over)

I feel like we got some very good discussion, and I think one of the obvious conclusions was that lending money (especially to the government) has just gotten a whole heck of a lot less risky over time. 

I also asked why inflation has stayed tempered through all this, and got some good answers as well. 

This leads me to the next step in my thought process...

**Question Posed:**

Now that we *maybe* know the 'how and why',  I think the next obvious question is where are we headed in the future (regarding interest rates) and what will the effect be on asset pricing. 

**So here's the thought experiment that I came up with**

The federal funds rate peaked in the early 1980's, the 10 year treasury yield was around 15.8% (June 1981). Today, the 10 year treasury sits at 0.70%. How much has equity growth been attributed to the falling risk free rate (10 year treasury used here) in that time?

In discounted cash flow analysis, pricing of an equity (company, market, whatever) is driven by the following:

Initial Cash Flow, Future Growth (both short term and long term), and Discount rate (Risk Free Rate + Risk premium)

The goal is to try to quantify how much of market returns have been driven by the fall in the risk free rate (from June 1981 to today)

As such we'll dumb down the the DCF analysis by using constants for all other input variable. 

-------------------------

DCF - 1981

Input:

FCF = $100 (dummy value)

growth (g) = 2% (reasonable terminal value rate)

Risk Free Rate (rfr) = 15.8% (10 year in 1981)

Risk Premium (rp) = 5.0% (dummy value)

Discount Rate (dr) = 15.8% + 5.0% = 20.8%

Terminal value calculation (for Intrinsic Value):

TV = FCF × (1 + g) / (dr - g)

TV81 = $542

-------------------------

DCF - Present

Using the same FCF, growth rate, and risk premium rates from above. 

Risk Free Rate (rfr) = 0.7% (10 year current)

Discount Rate (dr) = 0.72% + 5.0% = 5.72%

Terminal value calculation (for Intrinsic Value):

TV = FCF × (1 + g) / (dr - g)

TV20 = $13866

Annualized growth:

(TV20  / TV81)^(1/39) - 1 = 4.26% growth

**Findings**

The change in interest rate accounted for 4.26% annualized growth in the stock market. The total real returns between June 1981 to now (February 2020) are 8.4%. 

This accounts for almost half of the annualized growth in asset pricing in the past 40 years. 

Obviously this analysis is incomplete (and most likely wrong in some aspects), but I think it gets the point across that falling rates have had at least some (and most likely significant) affect on equity growth.

**What does this mean going forward**

So we've deduced that lowering interest rates is likely a primary driver for market returns. 

The next logical question is where would interest rates need to be in the future to replicate the same returns over the next 39 years? 

Using the same parameters in the above calculations (with only the risk free rate as the dependant variable), we get a 10 year treasury yield of -2.3% in 2059. 

So, can the world sustain an environment where you lend the government 100 dollars and they give you 98 back? I have no clue. 

What happens in an inflationary period where rates need to be adjusted upwards? Likely the inverse correlation will be observed. 

I think at the very least, we need to be prepared for decreased market returns going into the future, which could have major impacts to the newish trend of young retirees. 

**Disclaimer**

Obviously this was an initial look into an idea that's been kicking around in my head for a couple days. I realize that I used (practically) the two most extreme points in modern history. The point of the post wasn't too fear monger or anything like that. The findings section likely shows the max possible (or even exaggerated) influence that lowering rates have on the market. I do think, however, there is a non insignificant boost that can be attributed to equity returns. A further look at multiple time periods would need to be done to draw any real conclusions (especially comparing similar points in various business cycles - it does us no good to compare times of prosperity to times of distress).

**Further Discussion**

If you think the starting assumptions are so bad that it renders the entire post moot, I'd love to hear it. However, I realize that the total impact could skew in either direction (maybe by a decent amount), and I'd like to use this time to discuss the big picture and not get too lost in the weeds (yet).

t3_fqknq0,Long Thesis - Whirlpool (WHR),"Hey again everyone! I wanted to share my thoughts on another company I made a move on recently - [Whirlpool (WHR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WHR/). In the post below, I want to point anyone who wants to know what impact COVID has on my analysis to my [post on Weyerhaeuser (WY)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/fnl2zl/my_view_on_weyerhaeuser_wy/), since I chat about it in detail there.

**DISCLAIMER: I have a long position in $WHR & the stuff below is just my opinion, not actual investing or financial advice.**

Whirlpool is **the** home appliance company. It owns brand names that most folks would be familiar with - besides their namesake - like Maytag & KitchenAid.

Competition is fierce in the home appliance industry. Names like LG, Samsung, Electrolux, Haier, and Bosch are all key players. Cost is king in terms of determining profitability (just read through the Whirlpool 10-K to get a feel). As you can imagine - economies of scale are vital to achieving that cost advantage.

Whirlpool competes across three main market segments in home appliances:

* Laundry (30% of revenue)
* Refrigerators & freezers (31%)
* Cooking appliances (23%)

They are definitely the market leader in laundry with [\~45% market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/712023/united-states-statista-survey-washing-machine-brands-us-consumers-have-at-home/) and a close leader in refrigerators & freezers with \~[22% market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/711820/united-states-statista-survey-refrigerator-brands-us-consumers-have-at-home/). Combined with strong approx. FCFs of $600M annually - it's no wonder I got interested when it was trading around $4B in market cap a week and a half ago (currently \~$5.2B).

Now it's not all rosy - digging into their financials reveals a more gritty picture. Notably - two consecutive years of revenue decline and $4.1B in LT debt.

That leads me to the three major risks I see facing Whirlpool (WHR) going forward:

1. Company is on the decline
2. Company can't shift to e-commerce
3. Company defaults on debt

In terms of company decline, I see this as unlikely. The simplistic way to think about this: have people stopped doing laundry, using refrigerators, cooking? No. In fact, I see no structural shift in the market to cause the entire company to spiral over the next few years.

Are there any structural problems with the company itself? Well, digging into their geographic segment data - you can see that the revenue declines have come only in international markets. Whirlpool's core North American market is growing. If there was something structurally wrong about the company, I'd expect to see declines across the board and that doesn't seem to be the case here. For now.

What's happening in the international segments? I'm not fully sure yet. It could be increased competition from Bosch, Haier, etc. or something related to exchange rates and where production is happening for the different firms. I'm doing more analysis on this in the background, but haven't reached any insightful conclusions yet.

In terms of Whirlpool's (WHR) ability to shift to e-commerce...well this one does have me worried. I have no real insight into the company's culture, management, or otherwise that would lead me to believe they'd be bad or good at making this shift. But I will say that switching from a brick & mortar / distributor GTM to an e-commerce GTM is not trivial.

However, what does give me solace is that this factor is dependent on how quickly the population moves to e-commerce for major home appliances. I believe this will track slower and in line with population aging / turnover over the coming decade(s) as opposed to the next year or two.

Finally, there's the worry that Whirlpool (WHR) defaults on their large debt load in the short-run - making all of this long-run nonsense meaningless. On this point, I believe two factors will help Whirlpool (WHR) survive the short-term COVID shock:

1. $2B in cash on the balance sheet
2. [Fed financing investment grade debt](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/03/25/stimulus-bill-gives-fed-direct-loan-funds-with-few-strings/)

Whirlpool (WHR) is rocking a [Baa1 credit rating](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Whirlpool-Corporation-credit-rating-825000) right now and should be able to tap into Fed funds to refinance. Worst case, they also have $2B in cash that they can tap into to keep the wheels turning while the general economic environment recovers.

So yes - there are significant risks associated with Whirlpool (WHR). But my thesis on the macro and firm levels lead me to believe the upside is still attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.

**EDIT**: removed some verbiage that called things 'no-brainer' or 'significant upside' - I'm going to stick to wording that is a bit more neutral going forward.

t3_fr04rj,Let's Talk About Simon Property Group (SPG),"SPG is one of the largest REITs in the world and owns roughly 200 malls, many of which are considered high-quality.  Most, but not all, of these commercial properties are based in the US.  SPG make money by renting out space in the malls.  While some may say retail is dead, SPG has done fairly well, increasing revenue by over 25% and nearly doubling profitability over the past 10 years.  SPG is not in a dying industry and likely will continue to generate cash into the far future, assuming they can avoid bankruptcy in the near future.

On 10 Feb SPG announced they would acquire an 80% stake in another REIT owning high-quality malls, Taubman Centers (TCO).  This will cost them approximately $3.6 billion in cash, leaving $2.4 bn available under their credit facilities.

On 18 March SPG closed all of their malls to slow the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus).  As of 31 Dec 19 SPG had $6.0 billion available under its credit facilities.

In the past year, SPG had 5.8 bn in revenues and 2.9 bn in FCF.  Assuming a similar level of expenditure while closed, it costs them  about 2.9 bn/year or $220 mil per month to remain closed with 0 revenue.  SPG will probably allow tenants to defer rent or waive rent entirely in order to avoid ugly evictions.  Keeping tenants, even tenants paying 0 rent, is desirable to SPG in order to maintain the network effect that draws customers into their malls.

In the very worst case scenario, where SPG keeps all malls closed, reimburses their tenants all rent, consummates the deal with TCO at the full price of $3.6 bn, and is unable to secure any new credit, they will still be able to remain solvent for almost 11 months.

The current price of SPG is 58.17, with a market cap of $18 bn.  The average of the last 10 years' FCF is around 21 bn, meaning SPG is trading around 9x its average FCF and around 7x last years' FCF.  

SPG was trading around 20x FCF prior to the recent pandemic.  Currently shares can be had for a 2/3 discount.

Am I missing anything or is SPG an extremely good bargain at today's prices?",69,0.89,1585457461,"[['SPG', 13], ['FCF', 3]]",SPG,54.810001373291016,55.439998626708984
t3_froc8z,KONE $KNEBV High ROIC E&E business with huge exposure to China.,"KONE, a Finnish E&E (Elevator and Escalator) business that has huge exposure to China. Largest market share in China in New Equipment Market. And 4th largest globally. KONE is a great business with a tremendous record of ROIC (Including goodwill) with the 15 yr avg at 31%. Return on Tangible Capital as you expect is higher with a 15 yr avg of 90% which is bonkers. This is helped by the fact that the business always has negative net working capital as customers prepay with advance and progress payments and being Asset and Capital light with minimal CapEx with the 15 yr avg being 1.1% of Sales.


Obviously this is the long term view and COVID19 will significantly impact new equipment orders and ''modernization'' aftermarket business in the next 12 months, I believe their New Equipment Orders and modernization will take a massive hit in the double digits but recurring revenue in maintenance will be stable. KONE is under leveraged at 0.4x EBITDA and is capital light. However, they have an OpEx of 3.7B EUR with 3B in wages and salaries, their Variable Cost % of sales is 48%, we will see their EBITDA margin fall down to 11% from 15% last year and EBIT margin from 12 to 10%. They currently have a cash balance of 2.25B, a revolver of 1B which they haven't drawn and uncommitted commercial paper of 500M. With how underleveraged they are, I believe they'll be able to secure debt albeit at a higher cost.


New equipment orders in China won’t be like last two decades and will probably grow 2% each year but as it becomes a more mature market, sales mix will shift to recurring revenue in maintenance and aftermarket. Keep in mind, even if China’s New Equipment TAM doesn’t grow, It is still significantly larger than Non-China TAM. China’s New Equipment market is 600k units per year. The rest of the world is 300k.


KONE’s sales mix in mature markets is 1/3 New equipment and 2/3 service. In China, it’s 85% New Equipment and 15% service. There’s potential upside here for service revenue. Service is maintenance + “modernization”.


Another important metric is conversion of new equipment orders into maintenance contracts. New equipment usually comes with 2 years of maintenance and after that, the customer can choose to enter into a new longer contract. KONE also services non-KONE E&E in its installed base. KONE's conversion ratio for mature markets is 80%. For China, it’s around 50%. Again, potential upside. With increased conversion ratio, installed base could potentially grow 6% each year.


There's also opportunity for growth in the aftermarket “modernization” business of upgrades and replacements. By 2025, 30% of KONE's Installed base will be > 10 yrs old. Currently, that number sits below 10%. Modernization revenue grew by double digits last year and will probably continue to do so in the next decade (Edit: Obviously 2020 will not grow as mentioned earlier). Right now Modernization is only 15% of total revenue.


KONE's opportunity to shift the sales mix and increase the maintenance contract conversion ratio is helped by the consolidation of Property developers in China, where top 100 developers market share has increased significantly over the past 5 years due to increased regulation and costs. From 22% in 2014 to 55% in 2019. Top 10 market share has also increased in that time period and KONE has relationships with 9 of the top 10.


China’s maintenance service market is highly fragmented (top 4 E&E OEM only holds <30% of market) due to the large number of small independent maintenance providers that small building managers and owners choose to save costs. Large developers demand higher level of service and top OEMs will be able to gain significant market share in the next decade as property developers consolidate even more.


Another important market to consider is India; representing 7% of Global New Equipment market at ~60k units per year. It is expected to grow in HSD in the next decade. KONE has the 2nd largest market share there behind Schindler and is in a prime position to capture the growth opportunities. India's growing urbanization rate is a prime driver of this but New Equipment growth will not be similar to China in the last two decades in the high double digits due to a lower urbanization rate.


At the current price of 50 EUR, KONE's EV is trading at 14x 2019 EBITDA and at the Jan high of 60 EUR (Went down before US end of Feb high due to large exposure to China), it was trading at 16x NTM EBITDA. Among the Top 4, ThyssenKrupp has sold their elevator business. Schindler, KONE and UTX which owns Otis are public. UTX is obviously heavily diversified and trades at 12x EBITDA and Schindler at 14x. Hitachi and Mitsubishi are also large players in China having larger market share than Schindler but lack global presence compared to the top 4. I believe 14x EBITDA for KONE is a fair valuation and KONE has traded at a lower multiple than Schindler in the last 5 years and could potentially trade higher once they shift more towards recurring revenue in maintenance (40% of Schindler's revenue comes from maintenance compared to 30% for KONE). Plus, the high exposure to China (Largest Market Share) and having the 2nd largest share in India would put KONE in the position to have the highest growth opportunities compared to the Top 4.


With similar margins to last 5 years starting from 2021 at an EBIT margin of 14% (Which I think is a conservative assumption as mgt has outlined that they aim for an EBIT margin of 16% in the next decade through improvements in margins on their KONE care and KONE 24/7 services as they scale and more ''connected/connectivity'' E&E penetration in their installed base) and 2020 will have lower margins due to covid19 impact as stated earlier. 14x 2028F EBITDA and Cashflows discounted at 7% gives me a TP of 65 EUR, which is a 29% upside. With the targeted 16% EBIT margin, the TP is 71 EUR, 42% upside.

Please poke holes into my thesis, I'm still a beginner at this, thank you :)

t3_fsgg5z,LSE:BSD small cap illiquid stock asset play,"So BSD itself I have almost no interest in, it seems to loan money to other companies and doesn't seem like a good company. They also have an extremely shady past with a Ukranian oligarch who used to own majority shares having money laundered and stolen money from the company.

New management has been installed since however that has zwi williger and joseph williger (brothers) who have taken a majority share and have been purchasing huge amounts of the stock recently.

So this former problem should no longer be an issue.

These brothers both started another company called Willi food (NASDAQ:WILC) which is a supplier of kosher foods, vegetables, milk etc in israel.

The reason why LSE:BSD is a good value buy imo is because it owns the majority of WILC shares and WILC trades at a significant premium compared to LSE:BSD on the market which means their is a very good chance LSE:BSD is undervalued.

Numbers converted to GBP as of 21/03/2020:

BSD owns 5,800,000 WILC shares.

BSD has 129,000,000 shares outstanding.

WILC trades for £8.58 per share

BSD trades for £0.22 per share

Total worth of BSD owned WILC shares: £50m

Worth of BSD owned WILC shares each: £0.38

What the above calculations mean is that for every BSD share you buy for £0.22 you are essentially getting the economic value of a WILC share which is worth £0.38. The shares in WILC that BSD holds is worth almost 2x the value of the entire market cap of BSD.

Even if you think BSD's own cash flow and net income are terrible and worth a negative, their is no way it should be this cheap.

Not only that but the market cap of BSD is slightly higher than the enterprise value and WILC market cap is almost 2x it's own enterprise value, which means it's essentially even cheaper than the above calculation.

Also the liquidation value of BSD worst case scenario using benjamin graham's NNWC is currently this:

BSD NNWC = £26m cash + £9.24 AR + £2.77 Inv - £7.71 liab = £30m

BSD Net-Net Working Capital Per share = £0.23

Which means that if the company went bankrupt today and liquidated it's assets you would get £0.23 for every share. Usually when companies are trading at 1-1 NNWC they have serious issues but not BSD.

The best way to own a great company like WILC isn't to buy it. It's to buy BSD.

Currently the company ran into not having enough shares in the hands of the EU public to be listed on the LSE (25%), so whether they buy the remaining shares at a premium and take it private or delist it I have no idea. But I don't really care either way as this is a long hold for me.

t3_ftu76f,General Dynamics (NYSE: $GD) - Investment Thesis,"Disclaimer: This report is for informational purposes only. I do not hold any positions in $GD

**Company Overview**

General Dynamics (NYSE: $GD) is a global Aerospace & Defense company that provides products and services in business aviation, combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; information technology  (IT)  services; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions; and shipbuilding and ship repair. This business consists of 5 operating segments:

* *Aerospace*: Under Gulfstream, this segment produces mid to large cabin luxury business jets for commercial and government clients around the world.
* *Combat Systems*: CS produces and offers combat vehicles, weapon systems, and munitions to the U.S Government and its international allies. Product offerings include wheeled combat and tactical vehicles, battle tanks and tracked combat vehicles.
* *Information Technology*: This segment provides IT services, IT infrastructure modernization, and professional services to various U.S Government entities and other classified global customers. 
* *Mission Systems*: Mission Systems offers intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities which include ground systems, intelligence and cyber systems, and naval/air/electronic warfare systems to the U.S Defense community. 
* *Marine Systems*: MS produces nuclear-powered submarines, surface combatants, and auxiliary and combat-logistics ships for the U.S Navy and allies.

*Assumptions*:

With a risk free rate of 0.58% (10Y T bond), calculated cost of equity at 12.56% (high equity risk), and cost of debt at 1.24% (low interest rates), the weighted average cost of capital is 7.80%, slightly higher than the industry average. Over time, I assumed that this would converge to the industry average of 7%

With revenue growth, I assumed a 4% drop for the next year due to potentially reduced business jet demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the first year, GD would recover and grow at the current 8% revenue growth rate, until it reached 2% (expected risk free rate) growth in perpetuity. Similarly, with operating margins, next year's operating margins might be affected by the pandemic and hence I assumed 9% for the same. When GD recovers, it's operating margins are going to be in line with industry averages and its past performance at 12%.

Currently, GD is enjoying a 17.5% effective tax rate, however, I assume that these advantages will fade over time and the tax rate will converge to the marginal tax rate.

As the company grows, I also assumed that ROC will grow from 10% to 12%. However, this is not competitive with the industry average of 33.93%.

*Cash Flows*: The figure shows the cash flows of revenue and operating income under these assumptions.

*Value*: Discounting the above cash flows to the cost of capital gives us the firm value of $71,606 million. Removing debt and adding back cash yields the value of equity and results in an intrinsic value of $158.24 per share.

**Risks**

**General Dynamics relies on the U.S Government for a significant portion of their revenue**: Sales to the U.S Government accounted for 65% of the consolidated revenue for FY2019, and decreases in U.S. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in programs being delayed or terminated, which could impact performance.

**The Aerospace segment is subject to changes in customer demand for business jets**: Unlike defense products, business jet demand is subject to market conditions, which could impact performance.

**Conclusion**

General Dynamics is a highly diversified company in terms of product/service range and is an essential part of the U.S Defense industrial base that supports the DoD and its allies. With the current valuation and $GD trading at $127.40, I recommend $GD as a buy with a price target of **$158.24**.

**Introduction**

Implenia is a swiss construction and construction services company that operates in four segments: buildings, civil engineering, specialties and development. Division buildings focuses on the integrated conception and construction of complex new buildings, as well as the modernization of existing properties. The division is the second biggest by revenue and EBITDA (CHF 2,242 million and CHF 51.5 million). Civil engineering encompasses tunnel construction, special foundations and Implenia’s regional business, which includes road and railway construction. Division civil engineering is positioned to profit from the mobility and infrastructure investment megatrends. Civil engineering is the biggest division by revenue and EBITDA (CHF 2,300 million and CHF 77.2 million). Division specialties brings together Implenia’s niche services, including timber construction, formwork, facade and prestressing technology, energy management and construction logistics. The range of activities also includes integrated gravel, concrete and bitumen plants, interior construction, and an innovation hub that acts as an accelerator for new services. This division is the third largest by revenue and the smallest by EBITDA (CHF 242 million and CHF 19.2 million). The development division specializes in value-oriented development of properties and sites. Land is acquired in Switzerland’s premium locations and properties are developed into residential real estate, offices and hotels. Currently this division operates mainly in Switzerland, but the goal is to expand beyond the home market. This is the smallest division by revenues and the third largest by EBITDA (CHF 133 million and CHF 44.5 million). It also operates with the least amount of employees out of all the divisions by a wide margin (76 employees in development out of 10,168 employees total). The focus of the investment thesis will be on the value inherent to the real estate portfolio of this division.

The company experienced major operational challenges in its international business in 2018, resulting in a big hit to profitability (reducing EBITDA from CHF 174 million in 2017 to CHF 89.7 million in 2018), due to value adjustments of CHF 70 to CHF 90 million as a result of one-time write-downs. Consequently, the dividend was cut from CHF 2.00 per share in 2018 to CHF 0.50 per share in 2019. Although the company claimed that the issues were isolated to certain international projects and the loss of profitability was a one-time effect, the stock price declined more than 66%, from CHF 80 per share in mid 2018 to CHF 26 per share in mid 2019. After showing a stabilization of earnings in the first half of 2019 and confirming EBITDA guidance of CHF 150 million, the stock price rebounded to around CHF 40 per share. It stayed around there for a while before going to CHF 50 per share in February 2020 after presenting full year results and plans to spin-off the real estate portfolio associated with the development division. The stock price has recently fallen with the rest of equity markets to CHF 34 as of April 3. With concrete plans for the spin-off of the real estate portfolio in place, the risk/reward appears to be even better than it was in mid 2019.

**Spin-off of Real Estate Portfolio**

The real estate assets are currently valued at historic acquisition costs of CHF 189 million on the balance sheet. According to an independent real estate consulting and valuation firm, Wüest Partner AG, the actual current market value is more than CHF 600 million. In June of this year Implenia intends to spin-off 50% of the real estate assets at a market value of approx. CHF 300 million into the newly founded Ina Invest AG. Shareholders have voted and approved a special distribution by way of dividend in kind at the recent General Annual Meeting on March 24. Implenia shareholders will receive one share of Ina Invest AG for every five shares of Implenia.

After the spin-off, Ina Invest will hold a portfolio of high-quality real estate assets in prime locations across Zurich/Winterthur, Basel, and Lake Geneva. The transferred development projects are mostly residential real estate (54%), Offices (31%) and Hotels (9%).

The transaction is supposed to crystalize the true value of the real estate portfolio and create immediate revaluation gains for Implenia shareholders of over CHF 200 million (CHF 94.5 million real estate book value compared to estimated market value of CHF 300 million) with potential future revaluation gains for the retained assets that will likely be transferred at a later point as well. Concurrently to the spin-off Ina Invest will raise new equity of approx. CHF 100 million. Implenia shareholders will receive non-tradeable subscription rights to acquire the new shares of Ina Invest. Swiss Life Group, the biggest life insurer in Switzerland, intends to acquire a significant stake of up to 15% in the new company. Here’s the timeline of events as it currently stands:

At the current share price of CHF 33.50, as of market close on April 3, the company is valued at CHF 618 million. I don’t include the net cash position of over CHF 200 million in my enterprise value calculation, because I assume that the cash is tied up in operations due to the working capital dynamics in the construction business. I also disregard potential dilution from the subordinated convertible bond due for repayment in June 2022. The bond is convertible into 2.3 million shares at a price of CHF 76.05. Not a single conversion has been exercised since the issuance of the bond in June 2015. After adding minority interest of CHF 28 million, the enterprise value is CHF 646 million. If the real estate assets are in fact worth over CHF 600 million, you’re getting the core business for CHF 46 million, a fraction of EBITDA.

Obviously, the basic thesis is predicated on the real estate assets being actually worth CHF 600 million or more than 3x book value. How do we know that’s right? One way to find out is to look at the actual real estate sales closed by the company in the past. I’ve gone back and looked at all the real estate transactions disclosed in the annual reports since 2014.

On average sales have been closed at a 100% premium to the carrying amount on the books. Applying the premium from historic transactions to the current assets, values today’s real estate portfolio at about CHF 378 million. However, since the current real estate portfolio is comprised of only the highest quality assets in terms of property and location, it’s not unreasonable to assume a higher market value compared to past sales. It’s likely the portfolio was purposely distilled down to the best assets by selling of the lower quality properties and retaining the best ones. Nonetheless, in order to be conservative, I will assume different premiums to book value in my valuation.

But first let’s look at the value of Implenia’s core operations after the spin-off is completed. Full year 2019 EBITDA was CHF 186.77 million, plus one-time cost associated with the issues in 2018 of CHF 20 million, less half of the EBITDA contributed by the development division that will be spun-off, equals a post spin normalized EBITDA of CHF 184.52 million. Historically the company has traded at 6.11 times EV/EBITDA going back to 2009, some European comps are trading at 8 times EV/EBITDA. Putting a 5 to 7 times multiple on the normalized EBITDA and subtracting minority interests and the transferred book value of the real estate assets, translates to an equity value per Implenia share of CHF 43.33 to CHF 63.31 for the core business.

As for the real estate value, I assume different premiums to book value in my valuation: i) 3.17 (Wüest Partner AG), ii) 2.00 (based on historic transactions) and iii) 1.00 (assigning no premium to book value at all). Further, I consider a revaluation of transferred as well as retained assets. Applying the different premiums, I arrive at an equity value per Implenia share for the transferred assets of CHF 5.12 to CHF 16.24 and a potential revaluation gain for the retained assets of CHF 5.12 to CHF 11.18.

The sum of the parts analysis shows a band of plausible valuations, ranging from CHF 48.45 to CHF 90.68 per share, depending on your combination of assumptions about the EV/EBITDA multiple for the core business, the premium for the real estate assets and whether you apply a premium to the retained assets as well. Even with the most conservative assumptions (that can still be considered plausible) you end up with significant upside from the current share price. The mean target is CHF 69.27, implying more than 100% upside from the current share price.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the current setup looks like a promising risk/reward opportunity with potential upside of more than 100% and limited downside due to the hard asset value of the real estate portfolio. Additional upside may come from EBITDA margin expansion (currently 4.22% compared to mid-term guidance of 6.25% to 6.75%) and the increased capacity for cheap financial leverage in the new entity. Due to the its low equity ratio and the working capital dynamics in the construction business, Implenia has been constraint in the amount of debt it could employ. Ina Invest will be able to take better advantage of the zero-interest rate environment to accelerate the acquisition and development of new projects. In its core business, Implenia is well positioned to profit from megatrends in urbanization, mobility, and infrastructure development. But all of that is additional optionality. For the investment thesis to work out you only need to believe a very conservative set of assumptions.  

As of today, a lot of details about the rights offering aren’t available yet. I especially hope to get more information about insider participation. According to Implenia’s head of investor relations, an official prospectus will be published about the spin-off and the rights offering by Credit Suisse (underwriter) in the next weeks. Once it’s available I will do a follow up post.

They have delayed release of their 2019 filling so I decided to look at their 2018 10-k. I think this company is a perfect example of what to watch out for as, in my opinion, it looks very distressed and may go bankrupt. 

At first look they are posting consistent revenues and positive earnings. Current assets to current liabilities ratio is really large, also insignificant amount of debt. All good, I thought. 

Then taking a look at their cash flow statements I noticed that in the past ten years, the company's operations only generated cash 3 of those 10 years (last time positive was 2013). They also roll over debt each year (increasing)  and it looks like they pay it before closing the books for the year so it doesn't appear on the balance sheet. I thought this was strange and decided to look into it. I found that their A/R was greatly increasing and last 10k they posted an AR that was on a trajectory to be greater than their revenues (Revenues $88M, AR $67M). This was a huge red flag to me as they are either not able to collect on their customers, are fabricating sales and running them through AR, or a combination of the two. Their 10k states (pg22) that they have had issues collecting from customers and state that $40M of 67M is over 180 days past due but they only list their allowance as 224k.

I thought that if this company was doing this poorly in a boom economy I would venture a guess that they probably will not be around long in a recession economy. 

Anyways, wanted to share that even though you may have certain ratios that you look for in a company, always go deeper. Read the 10-k!

In light of the recent fall in oil prices due to the Saudi-Russian dispute and dampening demand for oil due to the lockdowns implemented globally, O&G stocks have taken a severe beating, falling approximately 50% from their highs at the beginning of the year. Not spared from this onslaught is Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (Hibiscus), a listed oil and gas (O&G) exploration and production (E&P) company.

Why invest in O&G stocks in this particularly uncertain period? For one, valuations of these stocks have fallen to multi-year lows, bringing the potential ROI on these stocks to attractive levels. Oil prices are cyclical, and are bound to return to the mean given a sufficiently long time horizon. The trick is to find those companies who can survive through this downturn and emerge into “normal” profitability once oil prices rebound.

In this article, I will explore the upsides and downsides of investing in Hibiscus. I will do my best to cater this report to newcomers to the O&G industry – rather than address exclusively experts and veterans of the O&G sector. As an equity analyst, I aim to provide a view on the company primarily, and will generally refrain from providing macro views on oil or opinions about secular trends of the sector. I hope you enjoy reading it!

## Company Snapshot

Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (5199.KL) is an oil and gas (O&G) upstream exploration and production (E&P) company located in Malaysia. As an E&P company, their business can be basically described as:

· looking for oil,

· drawing it out of the ground, and

· selling it on global oil markets.

This means Hibiscus’s profits are particularly exposed to fluctuating oil prices. With oil prices falling to sub-$30 from about $60 at the beginning of the year, Hibiscus’s stock price has also fallen by about 50% YTD – from around RM 1.00 to RM 0.45 (as of 5 April 2020).

https://preview.redd.it/lvdkrf0cabr41.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f250a713887b06986932fa475dc59c7c28582e

While the company is domiciled in Malaysia, its two main oil producing fields are located in both Malaysia and the UK. The Malaysian oil field is commonly referred to as the **North Sabah** field, while the UK oil field is commonly referred to as the **Anasuria** oil field. Hibiscus has licenses to other oil fields in different parts of the world, notably the **Marigold/Sunflower** oil fields in the UK and the **VIC cluster** in Australia, but its revenues and profits mainly stem from the former two oil producing fields.

Given that it’s a small player and has only two primary producing oil fields, it’s not surprising that Hibiscus sells its oil to a concentrated pool of customers, with 2 of them representing 80% of its revenues (i.e. Petronas and BP). Fortunately, both these customers are oil supermajors, and are unlikely to default on their obligations despite low oil prices.

At RM 0.45 per share, the market capitalization is RM 714.7m and it has a trailing PE ratio of about 5x. It doesn’t carry any debt, and it hasn’t paid a dividend in its listing history. The MD, Mr. Kenneth Gerard Pereira, owns about 10% of the company’s outstanding shares.

&#x200B;

## Reserves (Total recoverable oil) & Production (bbl/day)

To begin analyzing the company, it’s necessary to understand a little of the industry jargon. We’ll start with Reserves and Production.

In general, there are three types of categories for a company’s recoverable oil volumes – *Reserves, Contingent Resources and Prospective Resources*. *Reserves* are those oil fields which are “commercial”, which is defined as below:

*^(As defined by the SPE PRMS,)* ***^(Reserves)*** *^(are “… quantities of petroleum anticipated to be commercially recoverable by application of development projects to known accumulations from a given date forward under defined conditions.”  Therefore, Reserves must be discovered (by drilling), recoverable (with current technology), remaining in the subsurface (at the effective date of the evaluation) and “commercial” based on the development project proposed.)* 

*^(Note that Reserves are associated with development projects.  To be considered as “commercial”, there must be a firm intention to proceed with the project in a reasonable time frame (typically 5 years), and such intention must be based upon all of the following criteria:)*

      *^(- A reasonable assessment of the future economics of the development project meeting defined investment and operating criteria;)*  
      *^(- A reasonable expectation that there will be a market for all or at least the expected sales quantities of production required to justify development;)*  
      *^(- Evidence that the necessary production and transportation facilities are available or can be made available; and)*  
      *^(- Evidence that legal, contractual, environmental and other social and economic concerns will allow for the actual implementation of the recovery project being evaluated.)*

*Contingent Resources* and *Prospective Resources* are further defined as below:

       *^(-)* ***^(Contingent Resources)****^(: potentially recoverable volumes associated with a development plan that targets discovered volumes but is not (yet) commercial (as defined above); and)*  
      *^(-)* ***^(Prospective Resources)****^(: potentially recoverable volumes associated with a development plan that targets as yet undiscovered volumes.)* 

In the industry lingo, we generally refer to *Reserves* as ‘P’ and *Contingent Resources* as ‘C’. These ‘P’ and ‘C’ resources can be further categorized into 1P/2P/3P resources and 1C/2C/3C resources, each referring to a low/medium/high estimate of the company’s potential recoverable oil volumes:

       *^(- Low/1C/1P estimate: there should be reasonable certainty that volumes actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate;)*  
      *^(- Best/2C/2P estimate: there should be an equal likelihood of the actual volumes of petroleum being larger or smaller than the estimate; and)*  
      *^(- High/3C/3P estimate: there is a low probability that the estimate will be exceeded.)*  

Hence in the E&P industry, it is easy to see why most investors and analysts refer to the 2P estimate as the best estimate for a company’s actual recoverable oil volumes. This is because 2P reserves (‘2P’ referring to ‘Proved and Probable’) are a middle estimate of the recoverable oil volumes legally recognized as “commercial”.

However, there’s nothing stopping you from including 2C resources (riskier) or utilizing 1P resources (conservative) as your estimate for total recoverable oil volumes, depending on your risk appetite. In this instance, the company has provided a snapshot of its 2P and 2C resources in its analyst presentation:

https://preview.redd.it/o8qejdyc8br41.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3ab9be8f83badf0206adc982feda3a558d43e78

Basically, what the company is saying here is that by 2021, it will have classified as 2P reserves at least 23.7 million bbl from its Anasuria field and 20.5 million bbl from its North Sabah field – for total **2P reserves of 44.2 million bbl** (we are ignoring the Australian VIC cluster as it is only estimated to reach first oil by 2022).

Furthermore, the company is stating that they have discovered (but not yet legally classified as “commercial”) a further 71 million bbl of oil from both the Anasuria and North Sabah fields, as well as the Marigold/Sunflower fields. If we include these 2C resources, the total potential recoverable oil volumes could exceed 100 million bbl.

In this report, we shall explore all valuation scenarios giving consideration to both 2P and 2C resources.

https://preview.redd.it/gk54qplf8br41.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=c905b7a6328432218b5b9dfd53cc9ef1390bd604

The company further targets a 2021 production rate of 20,000 bbl (LTM: 8,000 bbl), which includes 5,000 bbl from its Anasuria field (LTM: 2,500 bbl) and 7,000 bbl from its North Sabah field (LTM: 5,300 bbl).

This is a substantial increase in forecasted production from both existing and prospective oil fields. If it materializes, annual production rate could be as high as 7,300 mmbbl, and 2021 revenues (given FY20 USD/bbl of $60) could exceed RM 1.5 billion (FY20: RM 988 million).

However, this targeted forecast is quite a stretch from current production levels. Nevertheless, we shall consider all provided information in estimating a valuation for Hibiscus.

To understand Hibiscus’s oil production capacity and forecast its revenues and profits, we need to have a better appreciation of the performance of its two main cash-generating assets – the North Sabah field and the Anasuria field.

&#x200B;

***North Sabah oil field***

https://preview.redd.it/62nssexj8br41.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd78f86d51165fb9a93015e49496f7f98dad64dd

Hibiscus owns a 50% interest in the North Sabah field together with its partner Petronas, and has production rights over the field up to year 2040. The asset contains 4 oil fields, namely the St Joseph field, South Furious field, SF 30 field and Barton field.

For the sake of brevity, we shall not delve deep into the operational aspects of the fields or the contractual nature of its production sharing contract (PSC). We’ll just focus on the factors which relate to its financial performance. These are:

· Average uptime

· Total oil sold

· Average realized oil price

· Average OPEX per bbl

With regards to average uptime, we can see that the company maintains relative high facility availability, exceeding 90% uptime in all quarters of the LTM with exception of Jul-Sep 2019. The dip in average uptime was due to production enhancement projects and maintenance activities undertaken to improve the production capacity of the St Joseph and SF30 oil fields. 

Hence, we can conclude that management has a good handle on operational performance. It also implies that there is little room for further improvement in production resulting from increased uptime.

As North Sabah is under a production sharing contract (PSC), there is a distinction between *gross oil production* and *net oil production*. The former relates to total oil drawn out of the ground, whereas the latter refers to Hibiscus’s share of oil production after taxes, royalties and expenses are accounted for. In this case, we want to pay attention to *net* oil production, not *gross*.

We can arrive at Hibiscus’s *total oil sold* for the last twelve months (LTM) by adding up the *total oil sold* for each of the last 4 quarters. Summing up the figures yields total oil sold for the LTM of approximately **2,075,305 bbl**.

Then, we can arrive at an *average realized oil price* over the LTM by averaging the *average realized oil price* for the last 4 quarters, giving us an *average realized oil price* over the LTM of **USD 68.57/bbl**. We can do the same for *average OPEX per bbl*, giving us an *average OPEX per bbl* over the LTM of USD **13.23/bbl**.

Thus, we can sum up the above financial performance of the North Sabah field with the following figures:

· Total oil sold: **2,075,305 bbl**

· Average realized oil price: **USD 68.57/bbl**

· Average OPEX per bbl: **USD 13.23/bbl**

&#x200B;

***Anasuria oil field***

https://preview.redd.it/586u4kfo8br41.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=7580fc7f7df7e948754d025745a5cf47d4393c0f

Doing the same exercise as above for the Anasuria field, we arrive at the following financial performance for the Anasuria field:

· Total oil sold: **1,073,304 bbl**

· Average realized oil price: **USD 63.57/bbl**

· Average OPEX per bbl: **USD 23.22/bbl**

As gas production is relatively immaterial, and to be conservative, we shall only consider the crude oil production from the Anasuria field in forecasting revenues.

&#x200B;

## Valuation (Method 1)

Putting the figures from both oil fields together, we get the following data:

https://preview.redd.it/7y6064dq8br41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4120563a011cf61fc6090e1cd5932602599dc2

Given that we have determined LTM EBITDA of **RM 632m**, the next step would be to subtract ITDA (interest, tax, depreciation & amortization) from it to obtain estimated LTM Net Profit. Using FY2020’s ITDA of approximately RM 318m as a guideline, we arrive at an estimated LTM Net Profit of **RM 314m** (FY20: 230m). Given the current market capitalization of RM 714.7m, this implies a trailing LTM PE of 2.3x.

Performing a sensitivity analysis given different oil prices, we arrive at the following net profit table for the company under different oil price scenarios, assuming oil production rate and ITDA remain constant:

https://preview.redd.it/xixge5sr8br41.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=288a00f6e5088d01936f0217ae7798d2cfcf11f2

From the above exercise, it becomes apparent that Hibiscus has a breakeven oil price of about **USD 41.8863/bbl**, and has a lot of **operating leverage** given the exponential rate of increase in its Net Profit with each consequent increase in oil prices.

Considering that the oil production rate (EBITDA) is likely to increase faster than ITDA’s proportion to revenues (fixed costs), at an **implied PE of 4.33x**, it seems likely that an investment in Hibiscus will be profitable over the next 10 years (with the assumption that oil prices will revert to the mean in the long-term).

&#x200B;

## Valuation (Method 2)

Of course, there are a lot of assumptions behind the above method of valuation. Hence, it would be prudent to perform multiple methods of valuation and compare the figures to one another.

As opposed to the profit/loss assessment in Valuation (Method 1), another way of performing a valuation would be to estimate its balance sheet value, i.e. total revenues from 2P Reserves, and assign a reasonable margin to it.

https://preview.redd.it/o2eiss6u8br41.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=03960cce698d9cedb076f3d5f571b3c59d908fa8

From the above, we understand that Hibiscus’s **2P reserves** from the North Sabah and Anasuria fields *alone* are approximately **44.2 mmbbl** (we ignore contribution from Australia’s VIC cluster as it hasn’t been developed yet).

Doing a similar sensitivity analysis of different oil prices as above, we arrive at the following estimated total revenues and accumulated net profit:

https://preview.redd.it/h8hubrmw8br41.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d23f0f9c3dafda89e758b815072ba335467f33e

Let’s assume that the above average of RM 9.68 billion in total realizable revenues from current 2P reserves holds true. If we assign a conservative Net Profit margin of 15% (FY20: 23%; past 5 years average: 16%), we arrive at estimated **accumulated Net Profit from 2P Reserves of** **RM 1.452 billion**. Given the current market capitalization of RM 714 million, we might be able to say that the equity is worth about twice the current share price.

However, it is understandable that some readers might feel that the figures used in the above estimate (e.g. net profit margin of 15%) were randomly plucked from the sky. So how do we reconcile them with figures from the financial statements? Fortunately, there appears to be a way to do just that.

***Intangible Assets***

I refer you to a figure in the financial statements which provides a shortcut to the valuation of 2P Reserves. This is the carrying value of **Intangible Assets** on the Balance Sheet.

As of 2QFY21, that amount was RM 1,468,860,000 (i.e. **RM 1.468 billion**).

https://preview.redd.it/hse8ttb09br41.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=82e48b5961c905fe9273cb6346368de60202ebec

Quite coincidentally, one might observe that this figure is dangerously close to the *estimated accumulated Net Profit from 2P Reserves* of **RM 1.452 billion** we calculated earlier. But why would this amount matter at all?

To answer that, I refer you to the notes of the Annual Report FY20 (AR20). On page 148 of the AR20, we find the following two paragraphs:

*^(E&E assets comprise of rights and concession and conventional studies. Following the acquisition of a concession right to explore a licensed area, the costs incurred such as geological and geophysical surveys, drilling, commercial appraisal costs and other directly attributable costs of exploration and appraisal including technical and administrative costs, are capitalised as conventional studies, presented as intangible assets.)*

*^(E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The Group will allocate E&E assets to cash generating unit (“CGU”)s or groups of CGUs for the purpose of assessing such assets for impairment. Each CGU or group of units to which an E&E asset is allocated will not be larger than an operating segment as disclosed in Note 39 to the financial statements.)*

Hence, we can determine that firstly, the intangible asset value represents capitalized costs of acquisition of the oil fields, including technical exploration costs and costs of acquiring the relevant licenses. Secondly, an impairment review will be carried out when “the carrying amount of an E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount”, with E&E assets being allocated to “cash generating units” (CGU) for the purposes of assessment.

On page 169 of the AR20, we find the following:

*^(Carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets, oil and gas assets and FPSO are reviewed for possible impairment annually including any indicators of impairment. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level CGUs for which there is a separately identifiable cash flow available. These CGUs are based on operating areas, represented by the 2011 North Sabah EOR PSC (“North Sabah”), the Anasuria Cluster, the Marigold and Sunflower fields, the VIC/P57 exploration permit (“VIC/P57”) and the VIC/L31 production license (“VIC/L31”).)*

So apparently, the CGUs that have been assigned refer to the respective oil producing fields, two of which include the North Sabah field and the Anasuria field. In order to perform the impairment review, estimates of future cash flow will be made by management to assess the “recoverable amount” (as described above), subject to assumptions and an appropriate discount rate.

Hence, what we can gather up to now is that management will estimate *future recoverable cash flows* from a CGU (i.e. the North Sabah and Anasuria oil fields), compare that to their *carrying value*, and perform an impairment if their *future recoverable cash flows* are less than their *carrying value*. In other words, if estimated accumulated profits from the North Sabah and Anasuria oil fields are less than their carrying value, an impairment is required.

So where do we find the carrying values for the North Sabah and Anasuria oil fields? Further down on page 184 in the AR20, we see the following:

*^(Included in rights and concession are the carrying amounts of producing field licenses in the Anasuria Cluster amounting to RM668,211,518 (2018: RM687,664,530), producing field licenses in North Sabah amounting to RM471,031,008 (2018: RM414,333,116))*

Hence, we can determine that the carrying values for the North Sabah and Anasuria oil fields are RM 471m and RM 668m respectively. But where do we find the future recoverable cash flows of the fields as estimated by management, and what are the assumptions used in that calculation?

Fortunately, we find just that on page 185:

*^(17 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED))*

*^((a) Anasuria Cluster)*

*^(The Directors have concluded that there is no impairment indicator for Anasuria Cluster during the current financial year. In the previous financial year, due to uncertainties in crude oil prices, the Group has assessed the recoverable amount of the intangible assets, oil and gas assets and FPSO relating to the Anasuria Cluster. The recoverable amount is determined using the FVLCTS model based on discounted cash flows (“DCF”) derived from the expected cash in/outflow pattern over the production lives.)*

*^(The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the Anasuria Cluster were as follows:)*

*^((i) Discount rate of 10%;)*

*^((ii) Future cost inflation factor of 2% per annum;)*

*^((iii) Oil price forecast based on the oil price forward curve from independent parties; and,)*

*^((iv) Oil production profile based on the assessment by independent oil and gas reserve experts.)*

*^(Based on the assessments performed, the Directors concluded that the recoverable amount calculated based on the valuation model is higher than the carrying amount.)*

*^((b) North Sabah)*

*^(The acquisition of the North Sabah assets was completed in the previous financial year. Details of the acquisition are as disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.)*

*^(The Directors have concluded that there is no impairment indicator for North Sabah during the current financial year.)*

Here, we can see that the recoverable amount of the Anasuria field was estimated based on a DCF of expected future cash flows over the production life of the asset. The key assumptions used by management all seem appropriate, including a discount rate of 10% and oil price and oil production estimates based on independent assessment. From there, management concludes that the recoverable amount of the Anasuria field is higher than its carrying amount (i.e. no impairment required). Likewise, for the North Sabah field.

How do we interpret this? Basically, what management is saying is that given a 10% discount rate and independent oil price and oil production estimates, the accumulated profits (i.e. recoverable amount) from both the North Sabah and the Anasuria fields exceed their carrying amounts of RM 471m and RM 668m respectively.

In other words, according to management’s own estimates, the **carrying value of the Intangible Assets of RM 1.468 billion** *approximates the accumulated Net Profit recoverable from 2P reserves*.

To conclude **Valuation (Method 2)**, we arrive at the following:

&#x200B;

|| **Our estimates** | **Management estimates** |
|:-|:-|:-|
| **Accumulated Net Profit from 2P Reserves** | RM 1.452 billion | RM 1.468 billion |

&#x200B;

## Financials

By now, we have established the basic economics of Hibiscus’s business, including its revenues (i.e. oil production and oil price scenarios), costs (OPEX, ITDA), profitability (breakeven, future earnings potential) and balance sheet value (2P reserves, valuation). Moving on, we want to gain a deeper understanding of the 3 statements to anticipate any blind spots and risks. We’ll refer to the financial statements of both the FY20 annual report and the 2Q21 quarterly report in this analysis.

For the sake of brevity, I’ll only point out those line items which need extra attention, and skip over the rest. Feel free to go through the financial statements on your own to gain a better familiarity of the business.

https://preview.redd.it/h689bss79br41.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed47fce6a5c3815dd3d4f819e31f1ce39ccf4a0b

***Income Statement***

First, we’ll start with the Income Statement on page 135 of the AR20. **Revenues** are straightforward, as we’ve discussed above. **Cost of Sales** and **Administrative Expenses** fall under the jurisdiction of OPEX, which we’ve also seen earlier. Other Expenses are mostly made up of **Depreciation & Amortization** of RM 115m.

**Finance Costs** are where things start to get tricky. Why does a company which carries no debt have such huge amounts of finance costs? The reason can be found in Note 8, where it is revealed that the bulk of finance costs relate to the *unwinding of discount of provision for decommissioning costs* of RM 25m (Note 32).

https://preview.redd.it/4omjptbe9br41.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaabfc824134063100afa62edfd36a34a680fb60

This actually refers to the expected future costs of restoring the Anasuria and North Sabah fields to their original condition once the oil reserves have been depleted. Accounting standards require the company to provide for these decommissioning costs as they are *estimable* and *probable*. The way the decommissioning costs are accounted for is the same as an amortized loan, where the initial carrying value is recognized as a liability and the discount rate applied is reversed each year as an expense on the Income Statement. However, these expenses are largely non-cash in nature and do not necessitate a cash outflow every year (FY20: RM 69m).

*Unwinding of discount on non-current other payables* of RM 12m relate to contractual payments to the North Sabah sellers. We will discuss it later.

**Taxation** is another tricky subject, and is even more significant than Finance Costs at RM 161m. In gist, Hibiscus is subject to the 38% PITA (Petroleum Income Tax Act) under Malaysian jurisdiction, and the 30% Petroleum tax + 10% Supplementary tax under UK jurisdiction. Of the RM 161m, RM 41m of it relates to deferred tax which originates from the difference between tax treatment and accounting treatment on capitalized assets (accelerated depreciation vs straight-line depreciation). Nonetheless, what you should take away from this is that the tax expense is a tangible expense and material to breakeven analysis.

Fortunately, tax is a variable expense, and should not materially impact the cash flow of Hibiscus in today’s low oil price environment.

*Note: Cash outflows for Tax Paid in FY20 was RM 97m, substantially below the RM 161m tax expense.*

https://preview.redd.it/1xrnwzm89br41.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=c078bc3e18d9c79d9a6fbe1187803612753f69d8

***Balance Sheet***

The balance sheet of Hibiscus is unexciting; I’ll just bring your attention to those line items which need additional scrutiny. I’ll use the figures in the latest 2Q21 quarterly report (2Q21) and refer to the notes in AR20 for clarity.

We’ve already discussed *Intangible Assets* in the section above, so I won’t dwell on it again.

Moving on, the company has *Equipment* of RM 582m, largely relating to O&G assets (e.g. the Anasuria FPSO vessel and CAPEX incurred on production enhancement projects). *Restricted cash and bank balances* represent contractual obligations for decommissioning costs of the Anasuria Cluster, and are inaccessible for use in operations.

*Inventories* are relatively low, despite Hibiscus being an E&P company, so forex fluctuations on carrying value of inventories are relatively immaterial. Trade receivables largely relate to entitlements from Petronas and BP (both oil supermajors), and are hence quite safe from impairment. *Other receivables, deposits and prepayments* are significant as they relate to security deposits placed with sellers of the oil fields acquired; these should be ignored for cash flow purposes.

*^(Note: Total cash and bank balances do not include approximately RM 105 m proceeds from the North Sabah December 2019 offtake (which was received in January 2020))*

*Cash and bank balances* of RM 90m do not include RM 105m of proceeds from offtake received in 3Q21 (Jan 2020). Hence, the actual cash and bank balances as of 2Q21 approximate RM 200m.

**Liabilities** are a little more interesting. First, I’ll draw your attention to the significant *Deferred tax liabilities* of RM 457m. These largely relate to the amortization of CAPEX (i.e. Equipment and capitalized E&E expenses), which is given an accelerated depreciation treatment for tax purposes.

The way this works is that the government gives Hibiscus a favorable tax treatment on capital expenditures incurred via an accelerated depreciation schedule, so that the taxable income is less than usual. However, this leads to the taxable depreciation being utilized quicker than accounting depreciation, hence the tax payable merely deferred to a later period – when the tax depreciation runs out but accounting depreciation remains. Given the capital intensive nature of the business, it is understandable why *Deferred tax liabilities* are so large.

We’ve discussed *Provision for decommissioning costs* under the *Finance Costs* section earlier. They are also quite significant at RM 266m.

Notably, the *Other Payables and Accruals* are a hefty RM 431m. What do they relate to? Basically, they are contractual obligations to the sellers of the oil fields which are only payable upon oil prices reaching certain thresholds. Hence, while they are current in nature, they will only become payable when oil prices recover to previous highs, and are hence not an immediate cash outflow concern given today’s low oil prices.

***Cash Flow Statement***

There is nothing in the cash flow statement which warrants concern.

Notably, the company generated OCF of approximately RM 500m in FY20 and RM 116m in 2Q21. It further incurred RM 330m and RM 234m of CAPEX in FY20 and 2Q21 respectively, largely owing to production enhancement projects to increase the production rate of the Anasuria and North Sabah fields, which according to management estimates are accretive to ROI.

*Tax paid* was RM 97m in FY20 and RM 61m in 2Q21 (tax expense: RM 161m and RM 62m respectively).

&#x200B;

## Risks

There are a few obvious and not-so-obvious risks that one should be aware of before investing in Hibiscus. We shall not consider operational risks (e.g. uptime, OPEX) as they are outside the jurisdiction of the equity analyst. Instead, we shall focus on the financial and strategic risks largely outside the control of management. The main ones are:

· Oil prices remaining subdued for long periods of time

· Fluctuation of exchange rates

· Customer concentration risk

· 2P Reserves being less than estimated

· Significant current and non-current liabilities

· Potential issuance of equity

***Oil prices remaining subdued***

Of topmost concern in the minds of most analysts is whether Hibiscus has the wherewithal to sustain itself through this period of low oil prices (sub-$30). A quick and dirty estimate of annual cash outflow (i.e. **burn rate**) assuming a $20 oil world and historical production rates is between **RM 50m-70m per year**, which considering the RM 200m cash balance implies about 3-4 years of sustainability before the company runs out of cash and has to rely on external assistance for financing.

**Table 1: Hibiscus EBITDA at different oil price and exchange rates**

https://preview.redd.it/gxnekd6h9br41.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbfb9621a43480d11e3b49de79f61a6337b3d51

The above table shows different EBITDA scenarios (RM ‘m) given different oil prices (left column) and USD:MYR exchange rates (top row). Currently, oil prices are $27 and USD:MYR is 1:4.36.

Given conservative assumptions of average OPEX/bbl of $20 (current: $15), we can safely say that the company will be loss-making as long as oil remains at $20 or below (red). However, we can see that once oil prices hit $25, the company can tank the lower-end estimate of the annual burn rate of RM 50m (orange), while at RM $27 it can sufficiently muddle through the higher-end estimate of the annual burn rate of RM 70m (green).

Hence, we can assume that as long as the ***average*** oil price over the next 3-4 years remains above $25, Hibiscus should come out of this fine without the need for any external financing.

***Customer Concentration Risk***

With regards to customer concentration risk, there is not much the analyst or investor can do except to accept the risk. Fortunately, 80% of revenues can be attributed to two oil supermajors (Petronas and BP), hence the risk of default on contractual obligations and trade receivables seems to be quite diminished.

***2P Reserves being less than estimated***

2P Reserves being less than estimated is another risk that one should keep in mind. Fortunately, the current market cap is merely RM 714m – at half of estimated recoverable amounts of RM 1.468 billion – so there’s a decent margin of safety. In addition, there are other mitigating factors which shall be discussed in the next section (*‘Opportunities’*).

***Significant non-current and current liabilities***

The significant non-current and current liabilities have been addressed in the previous section. It has been determined that they pose no threat to immediate cash flow due to them being long-term in nature (e.g. decommissioning costs, deferred tax, etc). Hence, for the purpose of assessing going concern, their amounts should not be a cause for concern.

***Potential issuance of equity***

Finally, we come to the possibility of external financing being required in this low oil price environment. While the company should last 3-4 years on existing cash reserves, there is always the risk of other black swan events materializing (e.g. coronavirus) or simply oil prices remaining muted for longer than 4 years.

Furthermore, management has hinted that they wish to acquire new oil assets at presently depressed prices to increase daily production rate to a targeted 20,000 bbl by end-2021. They have room to acquire debt, but they may also wish to issue equity for this purpose. Hence, the possibility of dilution to existing shareholders cannot be entirely ruled out.

However, given management’s historical track record of prioritizing ROI and optimal capital allocation, and in consideration of the fact that the MD owns 10% of outstanding shares, there is some assurance that any potential acquisitions will be accretive to EPS and therefore valuations.

&#x200B;

## Opportunities

As with the existence of risk, the presence of material opportunities also looms over the company. Some of them are discussed below:

· Increased Daily Oil Production Rate

· Inclusion of 2C Resources

· Future oil prices exceeding $50 and effects from coronavirus dissipating

***Increased Daily Oil Production Rate***

The first and most obvious opportunity is the potential for increased production rate. We’ve seen in the last quarter (2Q21) that the North Sabah field increased its daily production rate by approximately 20% as a result of production enhancement projects (infill drilling), lowering OPEX/bbl as a result. To vastly oversimplify, infill drilling is the process of maximizing well density by drilling in the spaces between existing wells to improve oil production.

The same improvements are being undertaken at the Anasuria field via infill drilling, subsea debottlenecking, water injection and sidetracking of existing wells. Without boring you with industry jargon, this basically means future production rate is likely to improve going forward.

By how much can the oil production rate be improved by? Management estimates in their analyst presentation that enhancements in the Anasuria field will be able to yield **5,000 bbl/day** by 2021 (current: 2,500 bbl/day).

Similarly, improvements in the North Sabah field is expected to yield **7,000 bbl/day** by 2021 (current: 5,300 bbl/day).

This implies a total 2021 expected daily production rate from the two fields alone of **12,000 bbl/day** (current: 8,000 bbl/day). That’s a ***50% increase*** in yields which we haven’t factored into our valuation yet.

Furthermore, we haven’t considered any production from **existing 2C resources** (e.g. Marigold/Sunflower) or any potential acquisitions which may occur in the future. By management estimates, this can potentially increase production by another 8,000 bbl/day, bringing total production to **20,000 bbl/day**.

While this seems like a stretch of the imagination, it pays to keep them in mind when forecasting future revenues and valuations.

Just to play around with the numbers, I’ve come up with a sensitivity analysis of possible annual EBITDA at different oil prices and daily oil production rates:

**Table 2: Hibiscus EBITDA at different oil price and daily oil production rates**

https://preview.redd.it/jnpfhr5n9br41.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe4b512bc17f576d87529651140cc74cde3d159

*The left column represents different oil prices while the top row represents different daily oil production rates.*

The green column represents EBITDA at current daily production rate of 8,000 bbl/day; the orange column represents EBITDA at targeted daily production rate of 12,000 bbl/day; while the purple column represents EBITDA at maximum daily production rate of 20,000 bbl/day.

Even conservatively assuming increased estimated annual ITDA of RM 500m (FY20: RM 318m), and long-term average oil prices of $50 (FY20: $60), the estimated Net Profit and P/E ratio is potentially lucrative at daily oil production rates of 12,000 bbl/day and above.

***2C Resources***

Since we’re on the topic of improved daily oil production rate, it bears to pay in mind the relatively enormous potential from Hibiscus’s 2C Resources. North Sabah’s 2C Resources alone exceed 30 mmbbl; while those from the yet undiagnosed Marigold/Sunflower fields also reach 30 mmbbl. Altogether, 2C Resources exceed 70 mmbbl, which dwarfs the 44 mmbbl of 2P Reserves we have considered up to this point in our valuation estimates.

To refresh your memory, 2C Resources represents oil volumes which have been discovered but are not yet classified as “commercial”. This means that there is reasonable certainty of the oil being recoverable, as opposed to simply being in the very early stages of exploration. So, to be conservative, we will imagine that only **50% of 2C Resources** are eligible for reclassification to 2P reserves, i.e. 35 mmbbl of oil.

https://preview.redd.it/mto11iz7abr41.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9028ab0816b3d3e25067447f2c70acd3ebfc41a

This additional 35 mmbbl of oil represents an 80% increase to existing 2P reserves. Assuming the daily oil production rate increases similarly by 80%, we will arrive at **14,400 bbl/day** of oil production. According to *Table 2* above, this would yield an EBITDA of roughly **RM 630m** assuming $50 oil.

Comparing that estimated EBITDA to FY20’s actual EBITDA:

|| **FY20** |**FY21 (incl. 2C)**|**Difference**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| **Daily oil production (bbl/day)** | 8,626 |14,400|\+66%|
| **Average oil price (USD/bbl)** | $68.57 |$50|\-27%|
| **Average OPEX/bbl (USD)** | $16.64 |$20|\+20%|
| **EBITDA (RM ‘m)** |632|630|\-|

Hence, even conservatively assuming lower oil prices and higher OPEX/bbl (which should decrease in the presence of higher oil volumes) than last year, we get approximately the same EBITDA as FY20.

For the sake of completeness, let’s assume that Hibiscus issues twice the no. of existing shares over the next 10 years, effectively diluting shareholders by 50%. Even without accounting for the possibility of the acquisition of new oil fields, at the current market capitalization of RM 714m, the prospective P/E would be about 10x. Not too shabby.

***Future oil prices exceeding $50 and effects from coronavirus dissipating***

Hibiscus shares have recently been hit by a one-two punch from oil prices cratering from $60 to $30, as a result of both the Saudi-Russian dispute and depressed demand for oil due to coronavirus. This has massively increased supply and at the same time hugely depressed demand for oil (due to the globally coordinated lockdowns being implemented).

Given a long enough timeframe, I fully expect OPEC+ to come to an agreement and the economic effects from the coronavirus to dissipate, allowing oil prices to rebound. As we equity investors are aware, oil prices are cyclical and are bound to recover over the next 10 years.

When it does, valuations of O&G stocks (including Hibiscus’s) are likely to improve as investors overshoot expectations and begin to forecast higher oil prices into perpetuity, as they always tend to do in good times. When that time arrives, Hibiscus’s valuations are likely to become overoptimistic as all O&G stocks tend to do during oil upcycles, resulting in valuations far exceeding reasonable estimates of future earnings. If you can hold the shares up until then, it’s likely you will make much more on your investment than what we’ve been estimating.

## Conclusion

Wrapping up what we’ve discussed so far, we can conclude that Hibiscus’s market capitalization of RM 714m far undershoots reasonable estimates of fair value even under conservative assumptions of recoverable oil volumes and long-term average oil prices. As a value investor, I hesitate to assign a target share price, but it’s safe to say that this stock is worth at least RM 1.00 (current: RM 0.45). Risk is relatively contained and the upside far exceeds the downside. While I have no opinion on the short-term trajectory of oil prices, I can safely recommend this stock as a long-term Buy based on fundamental research.",31,0.89,1586228703,"[['RM', 55], ['SPE', 1], ['SF', 1], ['DCF', 1], ['BP', 1], ['MD', 1]]",RM,11.550000190734863,15.149999618530273
t3_fzaeqw,A Diamond in the Rough - Debated Welcome!,"Many investors hunting for multi-baggers have their eyes set on companies that are 1) aligned with popular narrative and 2) growing revenue at a remarkable clip, reasoning that if revenue growth continues then the equity value will participate in a non-linear manner. Think $ZM or $TSLA. $ZM's been the beneficiary of the work from home narrative, while $TSLA's been on the front-line of pushing back against climate change in a capitalistic way. I won't get into whether I think either's a good investment in this thread, but they're both *stories* that investors have latched onto for a big potential payday.

The company I'm bullish on (and, disclosure, am long) is $HNRG, Hallador Energy, perhaps the antithesis of these two prior stocks as far as investing approach goes. While the $ZM thesis relies on the company being able to parlay the huge amount of new (unpaid) user-ship into cash flow, $HNRG is reliably free cash flow positive. While $TSLA vehicles run exclusively on electricity, $HNRG creates the electricity that $TSLA vehicles utilize, and yet you'd never find $HNRG in an ESG index.

Hallador is a miner of steam coal, coal that's burned by utilities to produce electricity. The obvious point is that coal usage is diminishing in the US. That's true, and has been true for decades, but coal will continue to play a large part in utilities' fuel-mix as renewables take up larger share; because it's a base-load fuel, coal has been depended on to power electrical grids when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Similarly, there's an ease of storage: you can simply stack it on-site and wait for a rainy day.

Coal companies have been failing left and right. There are ugly profiles of Murray / Foresight ($FELP) in the WSJ ([It's real ugly out there.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/murray-energy-pushed-to-brink-of-liquidation-11585661530) ). Stock charts for coal companies -- e.g., Peabody ($BTU), Contura ($CTRA), Alliance ($ARLP), Arch ($ARCH) -- are depressing. $HNRG's stock chart is no less bleak, down >60% year-to-date, and an unspeakable amount from its peak.

&#x200B;

[$HNRG over five years...Not pretty](https://preview.redd.it/9bcbxg3738s41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea67f891cdc352ec6d2ba803860746aa1cb8b735)

And yet, $HNRG's value proposition is different than these much larger companies. Peabody ($BTU) proudly proclaims that it's the largest private-sector coal company in the world, and that's precisely its problem. In a secularly declining industry, you don't want a dominant position. Hallador, by contrast, sells \~70% of its production inside the state of Indiana, a dependable friend of the fuel source as many utilities there rely heavily on coal-burning plants and many voters live in towns kept alive by the mining industry.

Lack of popularity alone isn't killing the coal share prices, though. The existential problem is debt. When these large companies were selling at higher volumes and higher prices, the debtloads looked responsible. But at this moment of economic contraction and of coal oversupply, the debt is beginning to look crushing. These large companies rely on the so-called ""spot market,"" selling their tons as they're producing them at the prevailing rate. More than 50% of sales in a given year for most large producers come from the spot market, as opposed to having pre-arranged sales agreements in place.

That's where Hallador is different. They have 100% of this upcoming year's projected sales already sold and at fixed prices. Hallador has sold 6.7M tons at $40/ton. Similarly, they have \~80% of next year's sales (2021) already sold at that same price, and \~75% of 2022 done at an even higher price. The reason this is so essential is that the current ""spot"" price of IL basin coal (the type they produce) is \~$33. Selling at that price-point would push a company like Hallador to bankruptcy in short, but they're mostly pre-sold for three years while their competitors are heading for liquidation.

&#x200B;

[From 10-K... 85&#37; of sales through 2022](https://preview.redd.it/zyvrh3x738s41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3335841800b05d78badf04bee1cd0cb904765248)

Arguably, there is no institutional investor interest in the name these days. With it being a coal company, not many endowments would want to bother with it for ESG reasons. It's also a very small cap stock now, which keeps large investors away; bear in mind, its enterprise value approached $1bn at one moment within the last ten years, and yet they produced the most coal ever in 2019. The disconnect between investor interest and business prospects is stark. Let's look at some numbers.

The company did \~$70M of EBITDA in 2019, and its enterprise value as of Friday was charitably \~$200M. For pricing, that's less than 3x last 12 month's EBITDA. Next year, they expect to do in the neighborhood of $65M of EBITDA. (By the way, the reason you should use EBITDA as opposed to an accounting-earnings denominator metric like P/E is because of the DD&A. You're probably familiar with depreciation and amortization, but what's the other D? That's depletion, and it makes intuitive sense why you'd add that back. If you're a coal company, you hold the land/minerals on your balance sheet as an asset. As you're digging the asset out of the ground, you're reducing your assets, which allows you reduce your taxes by charging that depletion as a loss of value, but you keep the cash; you're monetizing your in-the-ground assets. In 2019, you'll also see that they wrote down the value of a mine that they closed because it wasn't profitable enough to keep operating in this environment.)

&#x200B;

[From Hallador's press release](https://preview.redd.it/r4j4jyq838s41.png?width=281&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7447f68ea2f56176e1d125fde2b16deed6f769)

Here's their break-down of free cash flow:

&#x200B;

[From same 2020 press release](https://preview.redd.it/bu9lxek938s41.png?width=315&format=png&auto=webp&s=88bd476321536e1028807e4014732e3604b4065a)

&#x200B;

What's amazing here is that the market cap has dwindled to be just under $30M as of Friday's close. And so you're able to buy this at about 100% free cash flow yield (FCF was \~$30M for 2019). Hallador has guided (see transcript: [Seeking Alpha transcript 4Q19](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4331060-hallador-energy-company-hnrg-ceo-brent-bilsland-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) ) that they aim to pay down $35M of debt in 2020. For easy math, lets say the (very depressed) enterprise value of this company is $200M: $170M of debt and $30M equity. Suppose Hallador executes as they say, and the debt goes to $135M. That means the equity would've grown to $65M, over a 100% return from the $30M.

To be clear, the rational risk here is that the company goes bankrupt. They have $180M of gross debt, and their covenants say that the debt has to be no more than 2.75x adjusted EBITDA by year-end 2020. Lets say they do $60M of adj EBITDA this year (less than last year, despite closing the lower margin mine). The maximum debt debt they could have is $165M. So it could be tight. But Hallador (same transcript as above) guided that they aim to generate $50M of free cash flow this year: through 1) the operating business, 2) the reduced capital expenditures from closing the higher cost mine and literally driving the equipment down to their better-producing mines, and 3) from selling inventory they'd built up ahead of the coming shipping seasons. \[Also, for those focused on COVID, $HNRG is an essential business in Indiana; ventilators run on electricity.\] Additionally, they have a \~$5M dividend they could elect not to pay and use that to reduce debt if necessary.

In summary, I ask a question. People like YOLO call options, right? Aren't buying call options a pretty awesome deal? Yes and no. Yes because it's non-recourse leverage, meaning you can only lose the premium (and they can't come after your house), and you can make an unlimited amount of money. BUT actual call options have to overcome implied volatility and overcome timing risks (both time decay of option itself and having a definite expiry date). At worst, the investment proposition for buying Hallador is a call option. Your max loss is the premium - however much you put in - in the event they go bankrupt. But your maximum gain is uncapped on this levered company that's been thrown out with the bathwater. Consider the math if they survive this year and get re-rated to 5x EBITDA in two years. If EBITDA's $75M, then that'd be an enterprise value of $375. If they've paid down $60M of debt (30/yr), then that's $120M of debt remaining, implying equity of $255M. (They've traded nearly double this before). On $30M of equity today, that's about an eight-bagger. And instead of having time-decay on the option, to the extent they're paying the dividend, that carries north of 15%/yr at these prices.

I welcome the debate. Thanks for reading.

t3_fzyhkn,Betsson AB (BETS B) - VIC Application Practice,"I wrote this as practice for my VIC application. Posting this here to try and get some feedback and spread the word on a decent idea. I'm fairly new to this. I have no business education and I don't work in the finance industry thus my experience is limited.

&#x200B;

Betsson AB (BETS B) is a Swedish company that operates online casinos and sportsbooks in regulated European markets. Their business model consists of acquiring and conducting business through locally recognized strong brands as opposed to a single global brand. To support this the company operates a single technological platform that hosts all brands and subsidiary casinos, which allows for cost-effective and scalable operations.

1. Low CapEx requirements and their cost model is among the lowest in the industry. Currently sporting a 76% ROIC to after-tax FCF and very modest leverage both at present and historically.
2. Rough FY 2019 has investor expectations at an all-time low. Revenues from nordic markets, the company's biggest markets, declined -30% due to new regulation, mainly new gambling taxes and restrictions on customer loyalty/marketing incentives. Thanks to growth in other markets total revenues declined only -5% and EBIT margin dropped from \~22% to \~16,5% as gambling tax is booked under operational expenses. The new regulation has been in effect the entire FY of 2019, thus I believe we've seen the worst, if not all, of the impact from the new regulation and that revenues will normalize from here on. The company is increasingly diversifying across geographical markets to combat this and potential future new regulation.
3. Growing customer base. Annual cash deposits by customers have grown 13,5% CAGR the last 5 years and grew 6% in 2019 The number of active customers per annum has grown at 11,9% 5-year CAGR and grew 2,7% in 2019.
4. Sportsbetting is 24% of the company's revenue. They have developed an in house sportsbook which they are looking to license to other operators. First B2B agreement was signed early Q1 2020 and there is possibility of growth in this segment. I don't model this in my valuation due to uncertainty.
5. Satisfactory capital allocation. Very selective M&A where low price and strong brands are the main focus. The company repurchased around 2 million shares in march but unfortunately, the program is fully exhausted and a new program needs AGM permission.
6. Attractive valuation. The share is trading at 9x EV/FCF (after-tax) and 8,1x EV/EBIT whereas valuations for the industry are crazy high with an average of 37,5x EV/FCF. The closest comparable trades at 14,6x EV/FCF meaning about a 40% relative discount. Assuming a modest 2% growth per annum in FCF, with CapEx and debt staying at 2019 levels, FCF at year 2023 sits at around 832 million SEK. Given the ROIC and modest growth potential an EV/FCF multiple of 15 (6,66% FCF yield) seems reasonable given the risky business, but you might want to be more conservative.

That means upside of around 90% to the current price in 2-3 years time with a very limited downside already baked into the price.

t3_g6ov1t,Adjusting for aggressive pension plan expected returns?,"Given that companies assume pretty generous pension plan returns (despite majority invested into govt and corp bonds), I was trying to think of a way to adjust their expected returns and see a more realistic picture of the level of pension funding.

**1. Business Tenets** 

**1.1 Is the business simple and understandable?** 

Costco operates a relatively simple and understandable business. Revenues are derived from sales of commodity items and membership fees. 97% of revenues are derived from net and sales and 3% from membership fees, both metrics have increased slightly since 2017. 

Operations are worldwide (12 countries as 2019), but 67% of the 782 warehouses are located in the US and Canada. Expenses are derived from merchandise cost and SGA mostly, 87% and 3% of total revenues respectively. 

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by 10% from 2018 to 2019. 

In terms of labour relations, Costco stands as a desirable employer. On top of offering health and retirement benefits above competitors, Costco’s employees perceive on average above minimum wage. Costco is involved in several litigations regarding the treatment of seasonal employees and unfair compensation, these litigations should not affect future performance. 

Price flexibility is minimal, pricing and product offering are the main factors to succeed in the industry. Costco achieves price differentiation through discounts on big purchases and running tight inbound logistics. Costco would have to absorb the reduction in prices internally instead of passing the burden to members, in case of aggressive competition. 

Capital allocation has remained stable for the past two years, despite the increase in net sales (18.3%). ROE decreased from 0.25 to 0.24 in 2017-2019, and ROA increased from 0.07 to 0.08 in the same period. Dividends decreased considerably from $8.90 to $2.44 in 2017-2019 or 74.6%, this should work as a catalyst for the stock to appreciate as resources are used to buyback stocks instead.

**1.2 Does the business have a consistent operating history?** 

Yes, the company has been doing the same business for the past 43 years. The model delivers value to members. Renewal rates are in the high 80s in the US. The average annual sales per location are growing at 9% annually. The business model is shifting insofar as the company is deriving 4% of total sales from its online platform. In 2017, the average annual sales growth per location was only 4%. By 2019, the figure grew to 9%, way above the goal of 5% stated in the growth strategy. The reason for this growth is the expansion of operations outside of the US and Canada regions. Does the fact that the company is shifting resources to its online offering and locations overseas changes the underlying nature of the business? Considering that the original wholesale discount model delivers value, I see these changes as necessary adaptations to a new environment instead of deep changes in the underlying nature of the business.

**1.3 Does the business have favourable long-term prospects?** 

Costco should last for the next 25 years regardless of future recessions, and/or inflations/devaluation of the American dollar. The services and products of the company are: 1- desired, the majority of its offering is acyclical and members have to replenish them constantly. 2- has no close substitute, most of the offering is available at other retailers; however, Costco’s prices, private label brands and special offerings are unique and offer value to members. 3- is not regulated, there are no constraints in terms of prices besides the competition. Overall, the former factors, plus the large network of warehouses, distribution centers and food processing plants create a moat around Costco.

**2. Management Tenets**  

**2.1 Is management rational?** 

Despite its maturity, Costco allocates 12% of net sales into the construction and development of new warehouses. 25 new warehouses were opened and net sales increased by 8% in 2019. The stock repurchase program was retired. Additionally, 1.09 and 1.76 million shares were repurchased at an average of $225.16 and $183.13 during 2019 and 2018 respectively. In April 2019, a new repurchase program in the amount of 4 million was authorized. Cash dividends per common share declined by 73% from 2017 to 2019. Overall, management is allocating earnings into the construction of new warehouses and the repurchase of shares instead of paying cash dividends.

**2.2. Is management candid with shareholders?** 

Yes, it is. Annual reports do a solid job of detailing each of the risks that the company faces. Management informs shareholders about risks related to foreign currency, gasoline price fluctuations, exposure to the China-US trade war, regulations on wages and healthcare, cannibalization of sales from new locations, etc. Moreover, a 5% growth in sales annually is clearly defined as the benchmark to measure performance.

**2.3 Does management resist the institutional imperative?** 

Yes. Costco has avoided the minimization of its employees’ salaries and benefits despite the industry trend of reducing costs through minimum wages. Moreover, Costco grew organically instead of M&A during the last bull market. 

**3. Financial Tenets** 

**3.1 Focus on return on equity, not earnings per share** 

Return on equity has improved exponentially from 12.5% in 2011 to 26.10% as of 2019, as it is expected to continue increasing as Costco expands operations internationally. 

\*The company does not present marketable securities in the financials. 

Overall, management has been successful at generating returns given the capital employed.

**3.2 Calculate “Owner Earnings” to get a true reflection of the value** 

Owner earnings = Net income +  depreciation and amortization + depletion – capital expenditures + additional working capital 

Owner earnings in 2019  = 3659 + 1492 - 2865 = 2,286

Owner earnings in 2016  = 2679 + 1370 - 2502 = 1,547

Owner earnings are increasing substantially as economies of scale increase the profitability of each location. 

**3.3 Look for companies with high-profit margins**  

SGE as a % of sales has remained stable at 10% despite the constant addition of new locations. 

Operating profit margin 2019 = 2.45 

Operating profit margin 2017 = 2.12 

Operating margins are high for the industry, and they are increasing as operations expand. 

**3.4 For every dollar retained, make sure the company has created at least one dollar of market value** 

Retained earnings accounted for $10258 in 2019, which is an increment of $2372 from the $7887 of 2018. 

At the same time, the market value of the company increased from $217 per share (438,437) at the end of 2017 to $296 per share (438,775) at the end of 2019. 

Thus, market value increased from $95,140,800 to $129,877,400 or roughly $34,737 million which is considerably higher than the increment in retained earnings.

**Market Tenets** 

**4.1 What is the value of the business?** 

Using this publication as a guide

[https://medium.com/popularengineering/how-to-calculate-the-intrinsic-value-of-stocks-like-warren-buffett-f9b97e3738ba](https://medium.com/popularengineering/how-to-calculate-the-intrinsic-value-of-stocks-like-warren-buffett-f9b97e3738ba)

I ended up with the following numbers: 3% expected growth of earnings per share,10% discount rate, DCF 23.95$ per share, terminal value 99.17$ per share. This leaves me with an intrinsic value of $123.12 per share for Costco which is less than half of the current market price of the stock ($310). 

**4.2 Can the business be purchased at a significant discount to its value?**

No, Costco is currently trading at $310 per share or 35 PER which is substantially overvalued according to the analysis. 

Disclaimer: I do not own Costco stock. This was a learning exercise only. This is my first valuation and I would like to know what I could do better next time. Please let me know if you have any constructive criticism to offer, especially regarding my intrinsic value. Does estimating an intrinsic value of $123 per share makes sense? I feel like I probably messed something up along the way. 

Also, I used “The Warren Buffett Way” as a guideline for the analysis.

t3_g871k7,Forecasting a revenue beat for an Oil Tanker stock (spreadsheet included),"Hi everyone,

Given the current supply glut in oil, buying stock in tankers in anticipation of demand for floating storage is not a new idea. Nevertheless, I was interested in understanding whether there was still any upside to the trade.

I chose DHT Holdings because it is a pure-play on tankers, with a fleet of 27 VLCCs providing 100% of the revenue and 96% of the costs. My goal was simply to forecast the 2020 revenue, using the most recent CapIQ estimate of $646m (updated as of Apr 21st) as a benchmark.

The key details and inputs of the model are as follows – would love to see some discussion in the comments of whether you think they are realistic.

* Time-charter rates don't need to be estimated, they are stated in the annual reports. 10 of the 27 VLCCs have been chartered at a fixed rate (4 at $32k a day, 6 at $67k a day) for all of 2020.
* The harder part is estimating the spot-charter revenue. To do this, I have assumed that there will be a number of ""high-demand days"", for which DHT can charge a ""high-demand rate"", then for the rest of the year they charge a ""low-demand"" rate.
* For the low-demand spot rate, I assume it will revert to 2019's value of $60k a day on average across all days of the year (across all VLCCs).
* I initially estimate 60 high-demand days, i.e 2 months of high demand for floating storage
* The most important input is the high-demand daily rate, i.e how much DHT can charge a day for spot charter of a VLCC. I estimate the lower bound to be $130k, which is roughly 2x their 2020 fixed charter rate of 67k (the 2x is based on the 2019 time:spot ratio). I inferred the upper bound from the futures curve to be about $350k.  This, combined with some random sources on the internet (reddit, seekingalpha), gives a daily rate of anywhere between $200k and $250k.

**Using 60 high-demand days, a high-demand rate of $200k/day, and a low-demand rate of $60k/day, my forecasted 2020 Revenue is $710m, a 10% surprise over the CapIQ estimate of $646m.**

I include a sensitivity analysis - across a range of different assumptions, the CapIQ estimate looks pessimistic.

The spreadsheet is [here](https://github.com/robertmartin8/RandomWalks/blob/master/valuations/DHT_tankers.xlsx). Feel free to play around and let me know what you think! For more detail on how I estimated the inputs, I've written a blog post [here](https://reasonabledeviations.com/2020/04/24/oil-storage/).

EDIT: based on actual charter rates from /u/dolphinBuns, I think 200-250k is a little optimistic. I'd be inclined to revise that estimate to 175-225k.

# Version 2, with python

I spent some time yesterday working on this – it's not perfect, but I'm ready to share what I've done. This model is mechanically more complex, but conceptually more simple. I wrote a python script to do the following:

&#x200B;

* Pull all of the recent TankersInternational tweets into python. I stopped at Jan 1, so I will be missing some of the spot charters that were made in 2019.
* Parse those tweets to get: ship name, daily rate, number of days chartered, start date. There might be some mistakes here, since I'm not quite sure what conventions TankersInternational is using.
* Manually input the data from the Apr 1st press release on the DHT website announcing 6 time-charters, as well as the already-booked charters mentioned in the 2019 annual report
* Build a table (pandas dataframe) with 365 columns (one for each day) and 27 rows (one for each ship). Fill in the data for the days we know.
* Output to excel

At this point, the sum total is **285m in revenue**. To clarify, this represents all of the voyages that have been already chartered. This is a sample of the excel spreadsheet:

https://preview.redd.it/6m3pkopn1bv41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c83f7a229d79f273646e8df9a2ca571b51d4407

The zeros correspond to days that I don't have any known information for. In the previous post, I used a 2-stage model to estimate these unknown spot rates. However, in this post I have done something a lot simpler: I replaced every missing entry with the mean value of non-missing entries.

https://preview.redd.it/j9p89mzo1bv41.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=60ff866a110249dffaeda6620503661003f2a2a9

&#x200B;

The result of this exercise is a forecasted 2020 revenue of $**652m,** very close to CapIQ's estimate of $646m. Of course, it's up to you to decide whether the simple procedure of using the means

It would be possible to use this spreadsheet to instead estimate quarterly revenue (just stop at column 90), but I haven't done so.

**TL;DR: DHT's already-arranged 2020 charters represent $285m in revenue. Extrapolating these charter rates gives an annual revenue of $652m, in line with CapIQ's estimate.**

I have put the excel spreadsheet and python code on [github](https://github.com/robertmartin8/pValuation/tree/master/OilTankers) – feel free to download and have a play. If you have a github account, I'd appreciate if you left a star!

**Update**

Some people have mentioned the risk of CF commoditization. I'm not an expert in this space and have reached out to the company's IR to understand how the company is doing to mitigate commoditization and competition.

*Since it's from IR, take it with a grain of salt.*

Here's the response:

>In response to your question, there are distinct differences between aerospace qualified composites that Hexcel manufacturers and industrial-grade composites. Hexcel is focused on aerospace-composites. We do not see aerospace composites as trending towards commoditization. Industrial grade composites are a different discussion. Here are key barriers to consider that minimize the commoditization of aerospace composites:  
>  
>\* Intellectual property:  It is very difficult to create the formulations for aerospace carbon      fiber.  Hexcel is one of just a few competitors globally that      manufacture all three grades of aerospace carbon fiber.  
>  
>\* Manufacturing  process:   Aerospace-qualified carbon  fiber is manufactured under very high tension, much higher than industrial      fibers.  This takes purpose-built machinery and extensive experience to manufacture consistent quality and high yields that ensure a profit is      generated. Again, very few companies globally can manufacture      aerospace-qualified carbon fiber.  
>  
>\*Resin systems:   In addition to carbon fiber manufacturing, resin systems are designed to      optimize the interface with the carbon fiber. Aerospace-grade resin systems represent additional intellectual property and manufacturing prowess  
>  
>\*Vertical integration:  Hexcel is vertically integrated to a greater degree than our competitors,      enabling us to differentiate our product offering.  
>  
>\*Reputation:  Reputation is paramount in aerospace to ensure the safety and integrity of      the aircraft material and production. Consistent quality and on-time delivery are very important for aircraft manufacturing. Hexcel has a solid      industry reputation.  
>  
>\*Traceability:  All material and parts must be traceable from the final aircraft back to      their original manufacture. This requires an information technology      platform and robust processes. This would take significant time for a new      entrant to develop.  
>  
>\*Sole-source:   We are often sole-sourced for the life of an aircraft platform, limiting the potential for a new entrant to capture share  
>  
>\*Research: We are constantly enhancing our product offering and developing new      products that are designed to meet the needs of our customers today and in      the future.  
>  
>\*Scale:   Carbon fiber is a capital intensive business with long lead times. Our scale and global redundancy of manufacturing is an advantage when bidding  on contracts and further prevents new entrants.  
>  
>These barriers to entry help to illustrate how aerospace-qualified carbon fiber is not a commodity product nor do we expect it to become commoditized.

I posted my entire notes, quite long, and I think the link would provide an easier view.

**Notes To The Book “Margin Of Safety”**

**Author: Seth Klarman**

**1991**

**Prepared by: Ronald R. Redfield, CPA, PFS**

According to [www.wikipedia.com](https://www.wikipedia.com) ""Margin of Safety – Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor"" is a name of a book written by Seth A. Klarman, a successful value investor and President of the Baupost Group, an investment firm in Boston. This book is no longer published and sometimes can be found on eBay for more than $1000 (some consider it a collectible item). These notes are hardly all encompassing. These are notes I would find helpful for me, as a money manager. I do not mention Klarman’s important premise of looking at investments as “fractional ownerships.” I don’t mention things like that in these notes, as I am already tuned into those concepts, and do not need a reminder. Hence a reader of these notes, should read the book on their own, and get their own information from it. I found this book at several libraries. One awsome library I went to was the New York Public Library for Science, Business and Industry.  [http://www.nypl.org/research/sibl/index.html](http://www.nypl.org/research/sibl/index.html)

Throughout this paper you will see items in “quote marks.” The quotes exclusively represent direct quotes of Seth Klarman, from the book.  As I read this book, and through completion, I felt fortunate that I have been following most of his philosophies for many years. I am not comparing myself to Klarman, not at all. How could I ever compare myself to the greats of Klarman, Buffett, Whitman etal? 

What I did experience via this reading was a confirmation of my style and discipline. This book really put together and confirmed to me, so many of the philosophies and methods which I have been using for many years. These notes are a means for me to look back, and feel my roots every so often. At times in these notes, I have added sections which I have found appropriate in my workings.

**Introduction**

“This book alone will not turn anyone into a successful value investor.

Value investing requires a great deal of hard work, unusually strict discipline

and a long-term investment horizon.”

“This book is a blueprint that, if carefully followed, offers a good possibility

of investment successes with limited risk.”

Understand why things work. Memorizing formulas give the appearance of

competence. Klarman describes the book as one about “thinking about

investing.”

I interpret much of the introduction of the book, as to not actively buy and

sell investments, but to demonstrate an “ability to make long-term

investment decisions based on business fundamentals.” As I completed the

book, I realize that Klarman does not embrace the long term approach in the

same fashion I do. Yet, the key is to always determine if value still exists.

Value is factored in with tax costs and other costs.

Fight the crowd. I think what Klarman is saying is that it is warm and fuzzy

in the middle of crowds. You do not need to be warm and fuzzy with

investing.

Stay unemotional in business and investing!

Study the behavior of investors and speculators. Their actions “often

inadvertently result in the creation of opportunities for value investors.”

“The most beneficial time to be a value investor is when the market is

falling.” “Value investors invest with a margin of safety that protects from

large losses in declining markets.” I have only begun the book, but am 

curious as to how any value investor could have stayed out of the way of

1973 –1974 bear market. Some would argue that Buffett exited the business

during this period. Yet, it is my understanding, and I could be wrong, that

Berkshire shares took a big drop in that period. Also, Buffett referred his

investors who were leaving the partnership to Sequoia Fund. Sequoia Fund

is a long term value investment mutual fund. They also had a horrendous

time during the 1973 –1974 massacre.

“Mark Twain said that there are two times in a man’s life when he should

not speculate: when he can’t afford it and when he can.”

“Investors in a stock expect to profit in at least one of three possible ways:

a. From free cash flow generated by the underlying business, which

will eventually be reflected in a higher share price or distributed as

dividends.

b. From an increase in the multiple that investors are willing to pay

for the underlying business as reflected in a higher share price.

c. Or by narrowing of the gap between share price and underlying

business value.”

“Speculators are obsessed with predicting – guessing the direction of

prices.”

“Value investors pay attention to financial reality in making their investment

decisions.”

He discusses what could happen if investors lost favor with liquid treasuries,

and if indeed they became illiquid. All investors could run for the door at

once.

“Investing is serious business, not entertainment.”

Understand the difference between an investment and a collectible. An

investment is one, which will eventually be able to produce cash flow.

“Successful investors tend to be unemotional, allowing the greed of others to

play into their hands. By having confidence in their own analysis and 

judgment, they respond to market forces not with blind emotion but with

calculated reason.”

He discusses Mr. Market. He mentions when a price of a stock declines

with no apparent reason, most investors become concerned. They worry that

there is information out there, which they are not privy to. Heck, I am going

through this now with a position that is thinly traded, and sometimes I think

I am the only purchaser out there. He describes how the investor begins to

second-guess him or herself. He mentions it is easy to panic and just sell.

He goes onto to write, “Yet, if the security were truly a bargain when it was

purchased, the rationale course of action would be to take advantage of this

even better bargain and buy more.”

Don’t confuse the company’s performance in the stock market with the real

performance of the underlying business.

“Think for yourself and don’t let the market direct you.”

“Security prices sometimes fluctuate, not based on any apparent changes in

reality, but on changes in investor perception.” This could be helpful in my

research of the 1973 – 1974 period. As I study that era, it looks as though

price earnings ratios contracted for no real apparent reason. Many think that

the price of oil and interest rates sky rocketed, but according to my research,

that was not until later in the decade.

He discusses the good and bad of Wall Street. He identifies how Wall Street

is slanted towards the bullish side. The reason being that bullishness

generates fees via offerings, 401k’s, floating of debt, etc. etc. One of the

sections is titled, “Financial Market Innovations Are Good for Wall Street

But Bad for Clients.” As I read this, I was wondering if the “pay option

mortgages,” which are being offered by many lenders, are one of these

products. These negative amortization and adjustable mortgages have been

around for 25 years. Yet, they have not proliferated the marketplace in the

past as much as they have the last several years. Lenders such as

Countrywide, GoldenWest Financial and First Federal Financial have been

using these riskier mortgages as a typical type of loan in 2005 and 2006.

“Investors must recognize that the early success of an innovation is not a

reliable indicator of its ultimate merit.” “Although the benefits are apparent

from the start, it takes longer for the problems to surface.” “What appears 

to be new and improved today may prove to be flawed or even fallacious

tomorrow.”

“The eventual market saturation of Wall Street fads coincides with a cooling

of investor enthusiasm. When a particular sector is in vogue, success is a

self-fulfilling prophecy. As buyers bid up prices, they help to justify their

original enthusiasm. When prices peak and start to decline, however, the

downward movement can also become self-fulfilling. Not only do buyers

stop buying, they actually become sellers, aggravating the oversupply

problem that marks the peak of every fad.”

He later writes about investment fads. “All market fads come to an end.”

He clarifies, “It is only fair to note that it is not easy to distinguish an

investment fad from a real business trend.”

""You probably would not choose to dine at a restaurant whose chef always

ate elsewhere. You should be no more satisfied with a money manager who

does not eat his or her own cooking."" Just to reiterate, I do eat my own

cooking, and I don’t “dine out” when it comes to investing.

“An investor’s time is required both to monitor the current holdings and to

investigate potential new investments. Since most money managers are

always looking for additional assets to manage, however, they spend

considerable time meeting with prospective clients in addition to

handholding current clientele. It is ironic that all clients, Present and

potential, would probably be financially better off if none of them spent time

with money managers, but a free-rider problem exists in that each client

feels justified in requesting periodic meetings. No single meeting places an

intolerable burden on a money manager’s time; cumulatively, however, the

hours diverted to marketing can take a toll on investment results.”

“The largest thrift owners of junk bonds – Columbia Savings and Loan,

CenTrust Savings, Imperial Savings and Loan, Lincoln Savings and Loan

and Far West Financial, were either insolvent of on the brink of insolvency

by the end of 1990. Most of these institutions had grown rapidly through

brokered deposits for the sole purpose of investing the proceeds in junk

bonds and other risky assets.” 

 I personally suspect that the same will be said of the aggressive mortgage

lenders of 2005 – 2006. I have looked back at my files of 1st quarter 1980

Value Line for a few of these companies mentioned above. Here are some

notes on one of the companies I found.

Far West Financial: Rated C++ for financial strength. In 1979 it was

selling for 5/% of book value. “The yield-cost spread is under pressure.”

“Lending is likely to decline sharply in 1980.” “Far West’s earnings are

likely to sink 30 – 35% in 1980. Reasons: The deteriorating margin between

yield on earning assets and the cost of money, less loan fee income…” Keep

in mind that the stock price rose around 400% from 1974 – 1979. From

1968 – 1972 the P/E ratio was in a range from 11 –17. From 1973 through

1979 the P/E ratio was in a range from 3.3 – 8.1. It would be interesting for

me to look at the 1990 – 1992 Value Lines of the same companies.

**A Value Investment Philosophy:**

“One of the recurrent themes of this book is that the future is unpredictable.”

“The river may overflow its banks only once or twice in a century, but you

still buy flood insurance.” “Investors must be prepared for any eventuality.”

He describes that an investor looking for a specific return over time, does

not make that goal achievable. “Targeting investment returns leads investors

to focus on potential upside rather on downside risk.” “Rather than targeting

a desired rate of return, even an eminently reasonable one, investors should

target risk.”

**Value Investing: The Importance of a Margin of Safety”**

“Value investing is the discipline of buying securities at a significant

discount from their current underlying values and holding them until more of

their value is realized. The element of the bargain is the key to the process.”

“The greatest challenge for value investors is maintaining the required

discipline. Being a value investor usually means standing apart from the

crowd, challenging conventional wisdom, and opposing the prevailing

investment winds. It can be a lonely undertaking. A value investor may

experience poor, even horrendous, performance compared with that of other

investors or the market as a whole during prolonged periods of market

overvaluation.” 

“Value investors are students of the game; they learn from every pitch, those

at which they swing and those they let pass by. They are not influenced by

the way others are performing; they are motivated only by their own results.

He discusses that value investors have “infinite patience.”

He discusses that value investors will not invest in companies that they don’t

understand. He discusses how value investors typically will not own

technology companies for this reason. Warren Buffett has stated this as the

reason as to why he does not own any technology companies. As a side

note, I do believe that at some point, Berkshire will take a sizable position in

Microsoft ($24.31 5/1/06). Klarman mentions that many also shun

commercial banks and property and casualty companies. The reasons being

that they have unanalyzable assets. Keep in mind that Berkshire Hathaway

(Warren Buffett is the majority shareholder) is basically in the property and

casualty business.

“For a value investor a pitch must not only be in the strike zone, it must be

in his “sweet spot.”” “Above all, investors must always avoid swinging at

bad pitches.”

He goes onto discuss that determining value is not a science. A competent

investor cannot have all the facts, know all the answers or all the questions,

and most investments are dependent on outcomes that cannot be foreseen.

“Value investing can work very well in an inflationary environment.” I

wonder if the inverse is true? Are we in a soon to be deflationary

environment for real estate? I think so. Sure enough he discusses

deflationary environments. He explains how deflation is “a dagger to the

heart of value investing.” He explains that it is hardly fun for any type of

investor. He explains that value investors should worry about declining

business values. Yet, here is what he said value investors should do in this

environment.”

a. “Investors can not predict when business values will rise or fall,

valuation should always be performed conservatively, giving

considerable weight to worst-case liquidation value and other

methods.”

b. Investors fearing deflation could demand a greater discount than

usual. “Probably let more pitches go by.” 

c. Deflation should give greater importance to the investment time

frame.

“A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices

sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or

extreme volatility in a complex, unpredictable and rapidly changing world.”

“The problem with intangible assets, I believe, is that they hold little or no

margin of safety.” He describes how tangible assets might have alternate

uses, hence providing a margin of safety. He does explain how Buffett

recognizes the value of intangibles.

“Investors should pay attention not only to whether but also to why current

holdings are undervalued.” He explains to remember the reason you bought

the investment, and if that no longer holds true, then sell the investment.

He tells the reader to look for catalysts, which might assist in adding value.

He looks for companies with good management and insider ownership

(“personal financial stake in the business.”)

“Diversify your holdings and hedge when it is financially attractive to do

so.”

He explains that adversity and uncertainty create opportunity.

“A market downturn is the true test of an investment philosophy.”

“Value investing is, in effect, predicated on the proposition the efficientmarket (EMT) hypothesis is frequently wrong.” He explains that market

pricing is more efficient with larger capitalization companies.

“Beware of Value Pretenders”

This means, watch out for the misuse of value investing. He explains that

these pretenders came about via the successes of Michael Price, Buffett,

Max Heine and the Sequoia Fund. He labels these people as value

chameleons, and states that they are failing to achieve a margin of safety for

their clients. He claims these investors suffered substantial losses in 1990. I

find this section difficult. For one, the book was published in 1991, 

certainly not a long enough time to comment on investments of 1990. Also,

he doesn’t mention the broad based declines of 1973 – 1974

“Value investing is simple to understand but difficult to implement.” “The

hard part is discipline, patience and judgment.” Wait for the fat pitch.

“At the Root of a Value Investment Philosophy”

Value investors look for absolute performance, not relative performance.

They look more long term. They are willing to hold cash reserves when no

bargains are available. Value investors focus on risk as well as returns. He

discusses that the greater the risk, does not necessarily mean the greater the

return. He feels that risk erodes returns because of losses. Price creates

return, not risk.

He defines risk as, “ both the probability and the potential of loss.” An

investor can counteract risk by diversification, hedging (when appropriate)

and invest with a margin of safety.

He eloquently discusses the following, “The trick of successful investors is

to sell when they want to, not when they have to. Investors who may need

to sell should not own marketable securities other than U.S. Treasury Bills.”

Warning, warning , warning. Eye opener next. “The most important

determinant of whether investors will incur opportunity cost is whether or

not part of their portfolios are held in cash.” “Maintaining moderate cash

balances or owning securities that periodically throw off appreciable cash is

likely to reduce the number of foregone opportunities.”

“The primary goal of value investors is to avoid losing money.” He

describes the 3 elements of a value-investment strategy.

a. A bottoms up approach, searching via fundamental analysis.

b. Absolute performance strategy.

c. Pay attention to risk. 

**“The Art of Business Valuation”**

He explains that NPV and IRR are great tools for summarizing data. He

explains they can be misleading unless the flows are contractually

determined, and when all payments are received when due. He talks about

the adage, “garbage in, garbage out.” As a side note, Milford Blonsky, CPA

during the 1970’s through the mid 1990’s, taught me that with frequency.

Klarman believes that investments have a range of values, and not a precise

value.

He discusses 3 tools of business valuation”

a. Net Present Value (NPV) analysis. “NPV is the discounted

value of all future cash flows that the business is expected to generate.

He describes the importance of avoiding market comparables, for

obvious reasons. Use this method when earnings are reasonably

predictable and a discount rate can be chosen. This is often a guessing

game. Things can go wrong, things change. Even management can’t

predict changes. “An irresolvable contradiction exists: to perform

present value analysis, you must predict the future, yet the future is

reliably predictable.” He explains that this should be dealt with using

“conservatism.”

He discusses choosing a discount rate. He states, “A discount rate is, in

effect, the rate of interest that would make man investor indifferent between

present and future dollars.” He mentions that there is no single correct

discount rate and there is no precise way to choose one. He explains that

some investors use a generic round number, like 10%. He claims it is an

easy round number, but not necessarily the best choice. He emphasizes to be

conservative when choosing the discount rate. The less the risk of the

investment, the less the time frame, the less the discount rate should be. He

explains, “Depending on the timing and magnitude of the cash flows, even

modest differences in the discount rate can have a considerable impact on

the present-value calculation.” Of course discount rates are changed by

changing interest rates. He discusses how investing when interest rates are

unusually low, could cause inflated share prices, and that one must be

careful in making long term investments. 

Klarman discusses using various DCF and NPV scenarios. He also

emphasizes one should discount earnings or cash flows as opposed to

dividends, since not all companies pay dividends. Of course, one wants to

understand the quality of the earnings and their reoccurring nature.

b. Analyze liquidation value. You need to understand what would

be an orderly liquidation versus fire sale liquidation. Klarman

quotes Graham’s “net net working capital.” Net working capital =

Current Assets – Current Liabilities. Net Net working capital =

Net Working Capital – all long-term liabilities. Keep in mind that

operating losses deplete working capital. Klarman reminds us to

look at off balance sheet liabilities, such as under-funded pension

plans.

c. Estimate the price of the company, or its subsidiaries considered

separately, as it would trade on the stock market. This method is

less reliable than the other 2 and should be used as a yardstick.

Private Market Value (PMV) does give an analyzer some rules of

thumb. When using PMV one needs to understand the garbage in,

garbage out concept, as well as the use of relevant and

conservative assumptions. One has to be wary of certain periods

of excesses when using this method. Look at historic multiples. I

am reminded of some recent research I have been working on in

regards to 1973 – 1974. Utility companies were selling for over

18X earnings, when they typically sold for much lower multiples.

I believe this was the case in 1929 as well. Klarman mentioned

television companies, which historically sold for 10X pre-tax cash

flow, but in the late 80’s were selling for 13 to 15X pre-tax cash

flow. “Investors relying on conservative historical standards of

valuation in determining PMV will benefit from a true margin of

safety, while others’ margin of safety blows with the financial

winds.” He suggests when you use PMV to determine what you

would pay for the business, not what others would pay to own

them. “At most, PMV should be used as one of several inputs in

the valuation process and not the exclusive final arbiter of value.”

I think that Klarman mentions that all tools should be used, and not to give

to great a value to any one tool or procedure of valuation. NPV has the

greatest weight in typical situations. Yet an analyst has to know when to

apply each tool, and when a specific tool might not be relevant. He 

mentions that a conglomerate when being valued might have a variety of

methods for the different business components. He suggests, “Err on the

side of conservatism.”

Klarman quotes Soros from “The Alchemy of Finance.” “Fundamental

analysis seeks to establish how underlying values are reflected in stock

prices, whereas the theory of reflexivity shows how stock prices can

influence underlying values. (Pg. 51 1987 ed)”

Klarman mentions that the theory of reflexivity makes the point that a stock

price can significantly influence the value of a business. Klarman states,

“Investors must not lose sight of this possibility.” I am reminded of Enron

when reading this. Their business fell apart because they no longer were

able to use their stock price as currency. Soon covenants were violated

because of falling stock prices. Mix that difficult ingredient with fraud, and

you have a fine recipe for disaster. How many companies today are reliant

on continual liquidity from the equity or bond markets?

He discussed a valuation from 1991 of Esco. He indicated that the “working

capital / Sales ratio” was worthwhile to look at. He included a discount rate

of 12% for first 5 years of valuation, followed by 15%. He mentioned that

these higher rates indicated “uncertainty” in themselves. He stressed that

investors should consider other valuation scenarios and not just NPV. This

was all outlined above, but it was cool to see in a real time approach. He

discussed that PMV was not useful, as there were no comparables. He

indicated that a spin-off approach was helpful, as Esco previously

purchased a competitor (Hazeltine). He mentioned that the Hazeltine

acquisition, although much smaller than Esco, showed Esco to be severely

undervalued. He indicated that liquidation value would not be useful,

because defense companies could not be easily liquidated. He did look at a

gradual liquidation, as ongoing contracts could be run to completion. He did

use Stock market valuation as a guide. He noticed that the company was

selling for a small fraction of tangible assets. He called this a very low level,

considering positive cash flow and a viable company. He couldn’t identify

the exact worth of Esco, but he could identify that it was selling for well

below intrinsic value. He looked at all worst-case scenarios, and still

couldn’t pierce the current market price. He claimed the price was based on

“disaster.” He also noticed insider purchasing in the open market. 

Klarman discussed that management could manipulate earnings, and that

one had to be wary of using earnings in valuation. He mentioned that

managements are well aware that investors price companies based on growth

rates. He hinted that one needs to look at quality of earnings, and the need

to interpret cash costs versus non-cash costs. Basically, indicating a

normalization of earnings process. “…It is important to remember that the

numbers are not an end in themselves. Rather they are a means to

understanding what is really happening in a company.”

He discusses that book value is not very useful as a valuation yardstick.

Book Value provides limited information (like earnings) to investors. It

should only be considered as one component of thorough analysis.

“The Challenge of Finding Attractive Investments”

If you see a company selling for what you consider to be a very inexpensive

price, ask yourself, “What is wrong with this company?” This reminds me

of Charles Munger, who advises investors to “invert, always invert.”

Klarman mentions, “A bargain should be inspected and re-inspected for

possible flaws.” He indicates possible flaws might be the existence of

contingent liabilities or maybe the introduction of a superior product by a

competitor. Interestingly enough, in the late 90’s, we noticed that Lucent

products were being replaced by those of the competition. We can’t blame

the entire loss of wealth on Lucent inferiority at the time, as the entire sector

followed Lucent’s wipeout at a later date. There were both industry and

company specific issues that were haunting Lucent at the time.

Klarman advises to look for industry constraints in creating investment

opportunities. He cited that institutions frowned upon arbitrage plays, and

that certain companies within an industry were punished without merit. He

mentions that many institutions cannot hold low-priced securities, and that in

itself can create opportunity. He also cites year-end tax selling, which

creates opportunities for value investors.

“Value investing by its very nature is contrarian.” He explains how value

investors are typically initially wrong, since they go against the crowd, and

the crowd is the one pushing up the stock price. He discusses how the value

investor for a period of time (and sometimes a long time at that) will likely

suffer “paper losses.” He hinted that contrarian positions could work well in 

over-valued situations, where the crowd has bid up prices. Profits can be

claimed from short positions.

He claims that no matter how extensive your research, no matter how

diligent and smart you are, the diligence has shortcomings. For one, “some

information is always elusive,” hence you need to live with incomplete

information. Knowing all the facts does not always lead to profit. He cites

the “80/20 rule.” This means that the first 80% of the research is gathered in

the first 20% of the time spent finding that research. He discusses that

business information is not always made available, and it is also

“perishable.” “High uncertainty is frequently accompanied by low prices.

By the time uncertainty is resolved, prices are likely to have risen.” He hints

that you can make decisions quicker, without all of the information, and take

advantage of the time others are looking and delving into the same

information. This extra time can cause the late and thorough investor to lose

their margin of safety.

Klarman discusses to watch what the insiders are doing. “The motivation of

company management can be a very important force in determining the

outcome of an investment.” He concludes the chapter with this quote:

“Investment research is the process of reducing large piles of information to

manageable ones, distilling the investment wheat from the chaff. There is,

needless to say, a lot of chaff and very little wheat. The research process

itself, like the factory of a manufacturing company, produces no profits. The

profits materialize later, often much later, when the undervaluation identified

during the research process is first translated into portfolio decisions and

then eventually recognized by the market.” He goes onto discuss that the

research today, will provide the fruits of tomorrow. He explains that an

investment program will not succeed if “high quality research is not

performed on a continuing basis.”

Klarman discussed investing in complex securities. His theme being, if the

security is hard to understand and time consuming, many of the analysts and

institutions will shy away from it. He identifies this as “fertile ground” for

research.

**Spin-offs**

The goal of a spin-off, according to Klarman is for the former parent

company to create greater value as a whole by spinning off businesses that 

aren’t necessarily in their strategic plans. Klarman finds opportunity

because of the complexity (see above) and the time lag of data flow. I don’t

know in 2006 if this is still the case, but Klarman mentions there is a 2 to 3

month lag of data flow to the computer databases. I have owned several

spin-offs and have ultimately sold them, as they were too small for the pie,

or just not followed by my research. As I think back, I think quite a few of

these spin-offs did fairly well. One example would be Freescale. As I look

at the Freescale chart, it looks like it went from around 18 two years ago, to

around 33 today. Ahh, this topic alone, enabled the book to provide

potential value to my future net worth.

Bankrupt Companies

Look for Net Operating Losses as a potential benefit. He describes the

beauty of investing in bankrupt companies is the complexity of the analysis.

This complexity, as described often in his book, leads to potential

opportunity, as many investors shy away from the complex analysis.

Pending a bankruptcy, costs get leaner and more focused, cash builds up and

compounds with interest. This cash buildup can simplify the process of

reorganization, because all agree on the value of cash.

Michael Price and his 3 stages of Bankruptcy:

a. Immediately after bankruptcy. This is the most uncertain stage,

but also one of the greatest opportunities. Liabilities are not

evident, there is turmoil, financial statements are late or

unavailable and the underlying business may not have stabilized.

The debtor’s securities are also in disarray. This is accompanied

by forced selling at any price.

b. The second stage is the negotiation of a reorganization plan.

Klarman mentions that by this time, many analysts have pored

over the financials and the company. Much more is known about

the debtor, uncertainty is not as acute, but certainly still exists.

Prices will reflect this available information.

c. The third stage is the finalization of the reorganization and the

debtor’s emergence from bankruptcy. He claims this stage takes 3

months to a year. Klarman mentions that this last stage most

closely resembles a risk-arbitrage investment. 

“When properly implemented, troubled-company investing may entail less

risk than traditional investing, yet offer significantly higher returns. When

badly done, the results of investing can be disastrous…” He emphasizes that

the market is illiquid and traders take advantage of unsophisticated investors.

“Caution is the order of the day for the ordinary investor.”

Klarman mentions to use the same investment valuation techniques you

would use for a solvent company. He suggests that the analyst look to see if

the companies are intentionally “uglifying” their financial statements. He

cites the example of expensing rather than capitalizing certain expenses.

The analyst needs to look at off-balance sheet arrangements. He cites

examples as real estate and over-funded pension plans.

Klarman discusses the investor should typically shy away from investing in

common stock of bankrupt companies. He mentions there is an occasional

home run, but he states, “as a rule investors should avoid the common stock

of bankrupt entities at virtually any price; the risks are great and the returns

are very uncertain.” He discusses one ploy of buying the bonds and shorting

the stock. He used an example of Bank Of New England (BNE). He

mentioned that BNE bonds were selling at 10 from 70, whereas the stockstill carried a large market capitalization.

He concludes the bankruptcy section by stressing that this type of investing

is sophisticated and highly specialized. The competition in finding these

securities is savvy, experienced and hard-nosed. When this area becomes

popular, be extra careful, as most of the money made is based on the

uneconomic behavior of investors.

Portfolio Management and Trading

“All investors must come to terms with the relentless continuity of the

investment process.”

He mentions the need for liquidity in investments. A portfolio manager can

buy a stock and subsequently find out he or she made an error, or that a

competitor has a stronger product. With that said, the portfolio manager can

typically sell that situation. If the investment was in an annuity or limited

partnership, the liquidity is pierced and the change of strategy cannot be 

economically deployed. “When investors do not demand compensation for

bearing illiquidity, they almost always come to regret it.”

He discusses that liquidity is not of great importance in managing a longterm oriented portfolio. Most portfolios should contain a balance of

liquidity, which can quickly be turned into cash. Unexpected liquidity needs

do occur. The longer the duration of illiquidity, should demand a greater

form of compensation for the liquidity sacrifice. The cost of illiquidity

should be very high. “Liquidity can be illusory.” Watch out for situations

that are liquid one day, and illiquid the next. He claims this can happen in

market panics.

“Investing is in some ways an endless process of managing liquidity.”

When a portfolio is in cash only, the risk of loss is non-existent. The same

goes for the lack of gain when fully invested in cash. Klarman mentions,

“The tension between earning a high return, on the one hand, and avoiding

risk, on the other, can run high. This is a difficult task.

“Portfolio management requires paying attention to the portfolio as a whole,

taking into account diversification, possible hedging strategies, and the

management of portfolio cash flow.” He discusses that portfolio

management is a further means of risk reduction for investors.

He suggests that, as few as ten to fifteen different holdings should be suffice

for diversification. He does mention, “My view is that an investor is better

off knowing a lot about a few investments than knowing only a little about

each of a great many holdings.” He mentions that diversification is

“potentially a Trojan horse.” “Diversification, after all, is not how many

different things you own, but how different the things you do own are in the

risks they entail.”

In regards to trading Klarman stated, “The single most crucial factor in

trading is the developing the appropriate reaction to price fluctuations.

Investors must learn to resist fear, the tendency to panic, when prices are

falling, and greed, the tendency to become overly enthusiastic when prices

are rising.

“Leverage is neither necessary nor appropriate for most investors.” 

**How do you evaluate a money manager?**

a. “Personal interviews are absolutely essential.”

b. “Do they eat their own cooking?” He feels this is the most

important question of an advisor. When an advisor does not invest

in his or her own preaching, Klarman refers to it as “eating out.”

You want the advisor to act in a “parallel” fashion to his or her

clients.

c. “Are all clients treated equally?”

d. Examine the investor’s track record during different periods of

varying amounts of assets managed. How has the advisor

performed as his or her assets have grown? If assets are shrinking,

try to examine the reason.

e. Examine the investment philosophy. Does the advisor worry

about absolute returns, about what can go wrong, or is the advisor

worried about relative performance?

f. Does advisor have constraining rules? Examples of this could be

the requirement to always be fully invested.

g. Thoroughly analyze the past investment performance. How long a

track record is there? Was it achieved in one or more market

cycles?

h. How did the clients do in falling markets?

i. Have the returns been steady over time, or have they been

volatile?

j. Was the track record from a steady pace, or just a couple of

successes?

k. Is the manager still using the same philosophy that he or she has

always used? 

l. Has the manager produced good long-term results despite having

excess cash and cash equivalents in the portfolio allocation? This

could indicate a low risk approach.

m. Were the investments in the underlying portfolio themselves

particularly risky, such as shares of highly leveraged companies?

Conversely, did the portfolio manager reduce risk via hedging,

diversification and senior securities?

n. Make sure you are personally compatible with the advisor. Make

sure you are comfortable with the investment approach.

o. After you hire the manager, monitor them on an ongoing basis.

The issues that were addressed prior to hiring should be used after

hiring.

He finishes the book with these words. “I recommend that you adopt a

value-investment philosophy and either find an investment professional with

a record of value-investment success or commit the requisite time and

attention to investing on your own.”

t3_gdzpl5,The Bull case for Barrett (BBSI),"**BBSI Description:**

Barrett Business Services, Inc. provides HR consulting, staffing, and payroll functions for small and medium sized businesses in 29 states across the US. There are two ways they generate revenue: Professional Employer Services (PEO) and Staffing and Recruiting. Most of their revenue (87%) comes from PEO where they provide a suite of corporate functions for small businesses. They establish a co-employment relationship with each client company and assume responsibility for payroll functions, payroll taxes, and workers’ compensation claims. They have over 7,200 PEO clients in 2019 across 29 states utilizing 64 different branch locations.

 [US map with Barrett Branch locations](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamnormal/comments/gdzoc3/barrett_branches_2019/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

&nbsp;

**Business Model:**

BBSI helps small businesses grow by allowing them to outsource a task with high administrative burden. For many small businesses, payroll and administrative tasks are a fixed costs through HR employee salaries. PEO clients are billed for a percentage of client payroll, with the gross amount invoiced including direct payroll costs, employer payroll-related taxes, workers’ compensation coverage, and a service fee. By charging a percent of wages at the client firm, they help their clients by turning their former fixed cost administrative services into variable costs based on wages. PEO revenue is reported net of direct payroll costs, such as salaries, wages, and health insurance because BBSI is not the primary obligor for these payments, their clients are. “Indirect” payroll costs, such as payroll taxes and benefits and Workers’ Compensation expenses make up the bulk of operating costs.


The key to understanding BBSI’s financial statements comes down to establishing the co-employment relationship with their clients. BBSI’s primary operating expenses are Direct Payroll costs (10% of 2019 revenue), Payroll taxes and Benefits (46%), and Workers’ Compensation (22%). These three costs are passed entirely onto clients. Direct Payroll costs are related to their staffing business, while the latter two expenses are related to PEO clients. In addition to billing these above expenses, BBSI includes a service fee that is based on the total wages of employees. Their operating income can be simplified down to the service fee less their own corporate SG&A expenses. 

&nbsp;

**Competition:**

Implementing HR and admin solutions has become a big business for big businesses, but the small business market has had less focus from large players. Paychex & Salesforce both provide tech suites aimed at larger companies and white collar firms. Barrett’s average client size is roughly 30 employees, and the focus is on blue and gray collar firms.
Focusing on small business PEO, the main competition is TriNet Group Inc (TNET) and Insperity Inc(NSP). Focusing on geographical growth is the major differentiating strategy factor that Barrett uses to succeed in the PEO market. Focusing on conversions from internal HR departments, a substitute good for PEO, they achieve more aggressive pricing while still having net client ads quarter over quarter. Since 2016, their client base has grown at roughly 13.7% per year. The strength of growing geographically using branches allows them to fully flex their network of new clients from referral partners and clients.

&nbsp;

**Why is it a good buy now?**


•	**Barrett is trading at a significant discount to their historical trading valuations, as well as at discounts relative to their PEO peers.** After Q4’19, they reduced 2020 guidance on the eve of the full COVID pandemic, leading to a cool reception from the street. Alone, this would not be enough to feel it as a discount considering the significant impact COVID will have on their business. However, they also trade at a significant discount to their PEO peers while simultaneously leading their PEO peer group in FCF yield.

•	**Barrett has a strong balance sheet consisting of a negative net debt position, giving them significant leeway in weathering the COVID pandemic storm.** Less than 10% of their TEV being made up of interest-bearing debt, they are sitting pretty when it comes to weathering this storm. At some points during the business cycle it feels silly to start financial analysis at the balance sheet, but during a recession is not one of those times. With so few financial obligations, they are expected to trim corporate SG&A and investment in their new technology platform to keep more cash within the firm. Barrett stands a high chance of making it out the other side with a low chance of bankruptcy.

•	**Focusing on growth from a geographical perspective, Barrett’s management has carved out a small business niche that has seen success in their ability to open new branches.** Focusing on small businesses (average client firm size is ~30 employees) gives them an edge over some of the larger payroll companies in the market. Clients typically find BBSI through a strong referral network of both existing clients and external referral partners. Most of BBSI’s new clients are converting from internal HR/admin staff, which allows BBSI to provide a powerful value proposition. They turn small businesses’ fixed cost employee salaries into a variable cost based on total employee wages.

•	**Quality branch economics shows a model with strong operating leverage and marginal ROIC.** New branches take roughly a 500k investment and take about 5 years to become a mature branch. To be expected, more mature branches have more billing generation and more profit margin contribution. Barrett grows new branches geographically, allowing it to maintain high concentrations in local markets, ramp up the speeds of growth, and reduce fixed costs associated with new regions. Their strategies in opening new branches culminate in an ROIC in 2019 of 30.6%. The IRR on new branches that take 7 years to reach maturity is still more than 150%. 


Branch Stratification:

Number of Branches | Size | Run Rate| Average Profit Margin
---|---|----|----
18 | Mature | >$100 Mil | ~60%
20 | Emerging | $30-$100 | ~40%
26 | Developing | <$30 | ~10%
64 | Total |  | 

&nbsp;

**Conclusion:**


Based on the underlying business model and execution of the management, BBSI seems undervalued. Based solely on their strong balance sheet and large multiple discrepancy between both themselves historically and their fellow PEO peers, they seem like a buy and hold until well after the COVID-19 Crisis has ended. Their business will have the ability to ramp up naturally as their clients begin to hire again and small businesses are looking for a way to outsource admin they may have laid off. In conjunction with their strong branch economics, BBSI is currently undervalued for investors who can take a 3+ year time horizon allowing for the business to recover and their multiple to converge with peers.
A model has not been completed as Q1’20 results have not been released, which will likely contain big indications into how BBSI will perform for the coming quarter and year. A model will be completed, and an update posted once Q1’20 data has been released. 
Q1’20 is expected to be released 5/5 after market close. In the absence of a model, I have already thoroughly investigated their past few 10-k’s and read through most of their earnings calls over the past few years. I have spent a considerable amount of time insuring I understand how their business and financials tie to one another. To feel comfortable going long this business, I felt the need to dig in and understand it from their branch economics to how their workers’ compensation claims policy works with Chubb.

 I am more than happy to discuss the company and delve deeper into the financials of the company if anyone has any questions/comments.

t3_ggbkxk,The new age of Monetary Policy: an in-depth analysis of Federal Reserve Policy in the 2008 and 2020 financial crises,"**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailed out Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

t3_gharp1,A Guide to SEC Regulation for Start-Ups and Small Corporations [OC],"&#x200B;

During the 2008 crisis Uber, Airbnb, and other unicorns were created. This is some general registration advice for the future generation of unicorns being created during this crisis.

There are several securities registration exemptions that small corporations / start-ups can use depending on which one best fits the needs of the corporation. Using a securities registration exemption can help reduce some of the legal and accounting costs compared to a typical public offering of a security. The pros and cons of the following exemptions will be discussed in detail: Regulation A+ (Tier 1 and Tier 2), Regulation D (rules 504, 506(b), and 506(c)), Regulation Crowdfunding, and Intrastate Crowdfunding (rules 147 and 147a). The main differences between the exemptions are:

* How much companies can raise under each (offering limit)
* Regulatory oversight  

   * Filing requirements
   * Disclosure requirements
* Legal and accounting costs of the offering
* Who companies can solicit their offering to and who is eligible to invest
* Whether or not state regulatory laws are preempted
* Resale of securities

Regulation A is a securities registration exemption that has two tiers. For a 12-month period, the offering limit is $20 million or less for Tier 1 and $50 million or less for Tier 2. Offering under $20 million can elect to register the securities under either Tier. Under both Tier 1 and Tier 2, the company issuing the shares (issuer) must file an offering statement on Form 1-A with the SEC. This includes offering materials, two years of financial statements and an exit report. An issuer can only accept payment for the sale of its securities once its offering statement is qualified by the staff at the SEC. This SEC qualification requirement will still result in hefty filing and legal fees. General solicitation is permitted (you can freely advertise and talk about the advertising), and there are no restrictions on the subsequent resale of the securities offering. In addition, non-accredited investors are eligible investors.

There are relatively few differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 besides the offering limits. For Tier 1 offerings, in addition to filing Form 1-A with the SEC for review and qualification, state securities regulators will likely also review and qualify required offering materials. Companies offering securities under Tier 1 do not have ongoing reporting requirements other than a final report on Form 1-Z on the status of the offering and are subject to state regulation known as “blue sky” laws. There are no investment limits under Tier 1. Unlike Tier 1, offerings made under Tier 2 have slightly more stringent reporting requirements including ongoing annual and semi-annual reports after the offering is closed. Tier 2 offerings are not subject “blue sky” laws because federal law preempts state securities regulation. Under Tier 2, non-accredited investors are subject to certain investment limits. Although securities exempted under Regulation A are far less complicated and costly than an initial public offering (IPO), this can be a lengthy and expensive process for start-ups. Regulation A is primarily used to help growth companies raise money from non-accredited investors in a “mini-IPO” style offering as a potential alternative to institutional capital.

Regulation D is another set of securities registration exemption governed by Rules 504 and 506. Offerings under Rule 504 are limited to 5 million or less within a 12-month period, and anyone can invest in the offering. Exemptions under Rule 506 have no offering limits and is also preempts state securities law. Rule 506(c) only allows accredited investors, and Rule 506(b) allows for a maximum of 35 sophisticated non-accredited investors. For Regulation D exemptions, issuers must file Form D within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering, and the resale of the securities is restricted. Under 506(b), additional information is required for sales to non-accredited investors. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D exemptions do not have to wait for qualification to accept payment. The main difference between Regulation D exemptions is that general solicitation (advertising) is allowed under Rule 506(c), only in limited circumstances under Rule 504, and not permitted under Rule 506(b). Start-ups generally prefer Regulation D for its relatively lower cost and fast turnaround.

Regulation Crowdfunding is another securities registration exemption that allows companies to raise up to $1.07 million from both accredited and non-accredited investors within a 12-month period. General solicitation of the offering is permitted with some limitations after Form C (similar to Form 1-A) has been filed which includes two years of certified financial statements. Unlike other exemptions, Regulation CF offerings must be offered solely through an online platform operated by an intermediary registered as either a broker-dealer or a registered funding portal. Regulation CF preempts state law, and the securities sold in the offering are subject to certain transfer restrictions for 12 months. Typically, Regulation CF is geared towards startups who plan to raise money entirely through the internet.

Intrastate Crowdfunding is another set of securities registration exemptions governed by Rules 147 and 147a. Intrastate CF offerings have no offering limit, but the issuer must be an in-state resident and “doing business” in-state. Only in-state residents can invest in an Intrastate CF offering. Intrastate CF offerings have no SEC filing requirements but are subject to state securities registration laws. Securities sold through Intrastate CF offerings can only be resold in-state for a 6-month period. The only difference between Rule 147 and 147a is that under 147a, issuers are allowed to be organized in a different state and are allowed to solicit offerees outside of the state. Intrastate CF is primarily for companies that operate in-state and plan for a community-based offering instead of a broad-based internet offering.

For small corporations, Regulation D Rule 506(c) seems like the best option to fulfill the companies initial goals. This recommendation is based on the following assumptions: 1. The goal is to raise $5-20 million in the initial round, 2. corporations would like to advertise on the internet including social media, 3. corporations is looking to keep the cost of the offering as low as possible, and 4. corporations wants to operate in all 50 states. Here, Regulation CF is not viable options because the offering limit is too low for corporations’s fundraising goals. Also, Regulation CF is less preferable because it requires a registered intermediary to conduct the offering. In addition, based on the last assumption, Intrastate CF is not a viable option because the company’s operations and investors are limited to one state. This leaves Regulation A and Regulation D as the remaining viable options.

Regulation D is preferable to Regulation A for several reasons. First, Regulation D is more cost-effective versus Regulation A because the offering documents do not have to be reviewed or qualified by the SEC. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D only requires the issuer to file Form D within 15 days after the sale of the security and the filing does not have to be qualified by the SEC. Furthermore, unlike Regulation A, Regulation D offerings under Rule 506 have no offering limit. As stated before, Regulation A is more geared towards growth companies while Regulation D is a better fit for start-ups. In this instance, the only benefits Regulation A has over Regulation D is that the offering is not limited to only accredited investors, and the resale of the securities is not limited.

Having narrowed down the exemptions to Regulation D, Rule 506(c) is the most preferable exemption in this situation. Unlike Rules 504 and 506(b), Rule 506(c) allows start-ups to advertise the offering without violating the exemption. Although Rule 504 does not limit the type of investors, there is an offering limit of $5 million, and state securities regulation is not preempted. Overall, Rule 506(c) is the most cost-effective exemption that allows start-ups to advertise its offering and reach its fundraising goals. The main limitations of Rule 506(c) offerings are that the investors must be accredited, and the resale of the security is restricted.

**My analysis / commentary on the article**:

The trade tensions that are playing out between the United States and China, are most exacerbated in their nature within the technology industry. With COVID-19 acting as a short term dampener but long term catalyst in reigniting the trade war, as general anxiety over the pandemic has begun to subside with a recovery in sight, we're beginning to see things happening very quickly on the policy side from Washington. Given the imminent timing of election season coming up this fall, it makes sense that the current administration would have major incentives to try and create as much of an impact as they can in the given time period that they have.

As to immediate focus, semiconductors continue to be an area within technology that garners the majority of attention. The extension of banned exports for Huawei is, at least in its current state, essentially a signed death knell to the company, and is an extraordinarily direct sign of the current administration's stance. Whether it is a completely fair one is potentially up for debate. Huawei is being charged primarily for conspiracy to steal trade secrets ([https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-telecommunications-conglomerate-huawei-and-subsidiaries-charged-racketeering](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-telecommunications-conglomerate-huawei-and-subsidiaries-charged-racketeering)). This is true, but is also generally the case for the Chinese tech industry as a whole, as well as historically so for all developing countries. Ideally, the hope is that as countries become more developed though, this begins to taper off as has occurred with other countries like Japan, South Korea, etc. Historically, we have seen the need for an initial set of sanctions to solidify the consequences of continued IP theft. Take the sanctions made against Japan during the 1980s as an example. At least in this respect, the current trade war that's occurring between the US and China isn't completely novel. Huawei in this case will probably end up acting as a sacrificial figurehead.

TSMC announcing their intention to build a semiconductor fabrication facility within the United States, is likely a strategic move taken to ensure the continued stability and access of their existing export pipelines. The company manages a tricky situation in that the majority of its revenues come from exports to the US through its manufacturing contracts with companies like Apple, AMD, Nvidia, etc. while also having to contend with its much larger and closer neighbor China.

The article concludes with an argument that this is the beginning of a decoupling between the US and China. My personal take is that the reality is a bit more complicated. We live in a world that is deeply intertwined. Being dependent on each other for trade is a great factor in ensuring geopolitical and thus economic stability. Though it theoretically may be possible to successfully decouple, I doubt either of the two countries want this to actually occur as their primary goal.

I would continue to look at technology companies as a benchmark for early indication on how things will play out. Any moves made by the two countries will be most immediately and strongly felt there.",24,0.97,1589592750,"[['IP', 1]]",IP,30.43000030517578,33.0

t3_gr1ic0,Analysis of GameStop ($GME),"Hi All,

This is my first fleshed out attempt at a distressed debt thesis: [https://docdro.id/bPUrTcr](https://docdro.id/bPUrTcr). GameStop is an interesting situation - I've seen a lot of different takes on it, and wanted to take a crack at analyzing it. Full disclosure - I feel this doesn't get granular enough around certain things, but with the Company reporting earnings soon, I felt it worthwhile to get this out before (and then update as needed post-earnings). I've also flagged certain items (in my opinion) to look out for in their earnings.

I'd love to hear any comments / critiques - please feel free to respond to this post, PM me, or email me at the address in the document. I would welcome blunt feedback - no feelings will be hurt. My plan is to continue to do these and post them, so I feel I can only improve and build upon this analysis.

I hope some of you find this interesting, and for anyone that this is foreign to, please don't hesitate to ask questions - no question is ""too basic"" and I learn from trying to teach (I realize I have limited knowledge myself, but hey). Looking forward to your thoughts, I will be responsive.

&nbsp;



**Disclaimer:**
This is not investment or financial advice and the above thesis is predicated on my opinion & interpretation of the facts mentioned. I am currently long BBSI in my personal portfolio.


&nbsp;


**Barrett Overview**


Barrett Business Services, Inc. (BBSI) is a PEO firm offering management solutions to small business across the country. They enter co-employment contracts with their clients and manage their payroll and workers compensation claims businesses, saving them money and saving management time. Barrett utilizes a professional referral network that they develop geographically to source new clients cheaply. Upwards of 90% of their new clients are from their professional referral network, with many of them being converted from in-house HR management teams. Barrett is often the first PEO firm that many of their clients have worked with, allowing them to not sacrifice on pricing through fierce competition with other firms. Their clients are typically small blue and gray collar business, averaging just 30 employees per client.

When looking at their financials, the first thing that seems off is their PNL appears to be a very low margin business. Operating margins in 2019 were just 5.8%, but the numbers can be deceiving. BBSI bills their clients every pay cycle, and within their billing are included some of their major expenses that show up on their own PNL. Accounting rules stipulate that even though some of the expenses, such as Payroll taxes and benefits and Workers’ compensation, are billed directly to the clients for 100% of the expense, BBSI must still show this on their own PNL with top line revenue gross of these costs. Barrett’s operating income can be boiled down to the service fee they charge less their own corporate SG&A expenses.


&nbsp;
[BBSI EBITDA and Operating Margins](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamnormal/comments/guka63/bbsi_ebitda_and_operating_margins/)

 
Working with insurance requires that Barrett hold a significant amount of cash on their balance sheet. They keep reserves of restricted cash and investments which are used to fund future workers’ compensation claims as they arise. The net debt position when only considering the unrestricted cash is still negative, showing Barrett’s strong current financial strength. Unfortunately, being in a low interest rate environment typically hurts insurers like Barrett, where investment income can make up a significant portion of net income. Their average yield on investments in the past has been above 2%, but with the recent market turbulence it is expected to be just 1.5% for the full year 2020. 

For the modeling done for this report, EBITDA or FCFF have been used as the cash flow figure of choice. Both metrics exclude investment income, as modeling out the values and returns of their investment portfolios would be done with too much uncertainty to have significant value.

One of the main differentiating factors for Barrett from other PEO servicers are their focus on branch strategy. Many of the other PEO firms opt to use a SaaS model, which does not require the same type of geographic footprint that a branch strategy does. They have created a strong professional referral network which allows them to source new clients from in-house HR systems more cheaply than having to lure clients away from other PEO servicers. Barrett can then utilize more aggressive pricing practices as their retention stays high and most of their clients have never used a PEO firm before.

While this would indicate a negative effect on client attrition, they have quarterly net new clients going back over 5 years running. Pricing can be one of the main factors that client’s site when they leave Barrett, but their retention rate remains above 97%.
By keeping branch growth in geographic locations with an existing referral network they can leverage business connections with each new branch opening. Barrett currently has 57 branches open, and sees branches mature to profit margins in the ~60% range after roughly 5 years. This type of growth with the small investment it requires to get a branch started creates impressive operating leverage down the stretch. The branch model has another attribute, in that it focuses on small businesses. Relative to some of the other major PEO firms, Barrett’s average client size is on the small side at just 30 employees per client. 


&nbsp;


**Branch Stratification:**

Number of Branches | Size | Run Rate| Average Profit Margin
---|---|----|----
18 | Mature | >$100 Mil | ~60%
20 | Emerging | $30-$100 | ~40%
19 | Developing | <$30 | ~10%
57 | Total |  | 




&nbsp;


**PEO Industry**

While the PEO industry has a couple major players with significant market shares (ADP and PAYX), the overall market is quite fragmented. The entire PEO industry serves roughly 4 million employees in the country, with about 35-40 million estimated to have use for a PEO plan. This leads to significant market fragmentation with the substitute good for PEO services (in-house HR and insurance) as one of the largest holders of market share. Firms like ADP and PAYX are mostly non-PEO services, but they still compete directly in the same markets. Typically, clients will use all of a single servicers’ offerings. For example, rather than using ADP’s Payroll services and Barrett’s PEO services, firms will typically opt to use a single servicer for all related functions.

The high degree of market fragmentation has not significantly hurt the retention rates of PEO firms, often averaging above 95%. Switching costs are apparent even in systems like these, which companies can be weary of changing due to the time it takes to learn new services and programs. The stickiness of customers alone is not enough for most firms to have any level of sustainable competitive advantage, however ADP and PAYX have been able to achieve some level of economies of scale through their sheer size. Spreading out their fixed cost investments across a higher number of Worksite Employees/Sales allows them to generally outperform their peers, explaining their much larger multiples relative to the rest of the peer group.

The PNL of firms that are predominantly PEO can be tricky as their revenues include costs that are directly billed to their clients under their co-employment arrangement. The main financial outcomes of the industry are low capital investments and high cash returns on those investments. Insurance is a cash heavy business, leading to significant levels of excess cash on all of their balance sheets, lowering their overall capital investment. Relative to income metrics such as EBIT, EBITDA, and FCFF, the return on invested capital metrics generally look very strong.

Barrett Business Services Inc (BBSI) | 4.69 | 8.3 | 17.7% | N/A | 30.6%

Paychex Inc (PAYX) | 22.27 | 23.57 | 4.5% | .08 | 49.4%

With the current COVID pandemic, the labor market shock has been significant and hit PEO firms particularly hard. PEO’s charge a service fee based on the amount of wages billed for. A decrease in workers or a decrease in wages would lead to lower revenues for the industry. Such a strong tie to labor market health will inevitably see their valuations hurt as they see revenues and profits fall for the whole year 2020. A slower recovery will also lead to these effects bleeding into 2021. With such low multiples relative to historical averages, the industry poses some opportunities for investors with a longer time horizon who will hold through the recovery.

**Thesis for Barrett**
	
I laid out my thesis in my previous post, and after an additional month of research it has been cemented. One additional point as been added to my original thesis. My thesis points have been recreated below. 

•	**Barrett is trading at a significant discount to their historical trading valuations, as well as at discounts relative to their PEO peers.** After Q4’19, they reduced 2020 guidance on the eve of the full COVID pandemic, leading to a cool reception from the street. Alone, this would not be enough to feel it as a discount considering the significant impact COVID will have on their business. However, they also trade at a significant discount to their PEO peers while simultaneously leading their PEO peer group along metrics such as FCF yield and EV/EBITDA. They currently trade 2.1 standard deviations below their 3-year average EV/EBITDA ratio, a greater discount than any of their peers in PEO peer group.

•	**Barrett has a strong balance sheet consisting of a negative net debt position, giving them significant leeway in weathering the COVID pandemic storm.** Less than 10% of their TEV being made up of interest-bearing debt, they are sitting pretty when it comes to weathering this storm. At some points during the business cycle it feels silly to start financial analysis at the balance sheet, but during a recession is not one of those times. With so few financial obligations, they are expected to trim corporate SG&A and investment in their new technology platform to keep more cash within the firm. Barrett stands a high chance of making it out the other side with a low chance of bankruptcy.

•	**The PEO industry is currently trading at a discount to mid-business cycle values, leading to investors with a longer time horizon an attractive return potential.** Barrett is not the only PEO firm trading at a significant discount to their historical values. The entire PEO industry is being hit hard by this pandemic, but it creates an attractive bet as the industry takes advantage of the fall in unemployment. Across the major PEO players, April was viewed as the low point in employment data, leading to a rough Q2’20, but strong financials in the quarters following. 

•	**Focusing on growth from a geographical perspective, Barrett’s management has carved out a small business niche that has seen success in their ability to open new branches.** Focusing on small businesses (average client firm size is ~30 employees) gives them an edge over some of the larger payroll companies in the market. Clients typically find BBSI through a strong referral network of both existing clients and external referral partners. Most of BBSI’s new clients are converting from internal HR/admin staff, which allows BBSI to provide a powerful value proposition. They turn small businesses’ fixed cost employee salaries into a variable cost based on total employee wages.

•	**Quality branch economics shows a model with strong operating leverage and marginal ROIC.** New branches take roughly a 500k investment and take about 5 years to become a mature branch. To be expected, more mature branches have more billing generation and more profit margin contribution. Barrett grows new branches geographically, allowing it to maintain high concentrations in local markets, ramp up the speeds of growth, and reduce fixed costs associated with new regions. Their strategies in opening new branches culminate in an ROIC in 2019 of 30.6%. The IRR on new branches that take 7 years to reach maturity is still more than 150%. 


&nbsp;

**Base Case Model**

Management had conviction that April was the bottom of their gross billing cycle based on the entire month of April’s billing and the first week of May’s. This view was further supported by other PEO management teams indicating April as their bottom. My model includes all of the cost savings metrics announced thus far in the Q1’20 earnings call and includes projections they made for full year 2020 as well as projecting April as the low point. Management has projected that even in their most pessimistic scenarios that they will see positive net income in 2020. I have 2020 sales projected to be 11% below 2019, with a full year EBIT margin of 0.3%. Overall, my projections for 2020 are more conservative than the average of the 3 coverage analysts following BBSI.

2021 follows many of the similar patterns set in 2020, with a slow recovery to get back to normal. While sales growth looks big, the 2021 sales I have projected are still less than 2019 by 1.4%. Margins are beginning to normalize, but without the same scale and deferred branch openings, the operating margins will not fully come back until 2024. I view this assumption as conservative as their new technology platform should see increases SG&A efficiency once it is fully implemented as soon as Q3’20. 

The model ends by applying a multiple to terminal value based on their historical trading multiples as well as multiples from their small cap PEO peer group. While currently in the trough of their business cycle, BBSI will see multiple expansion as PEO becomes a higher demand service during and after the recovery. My time horizon on this investment is in the 3-5-year range as this will give enough time for the recovery efforts to take place allowing for proper multiple expansion towards their mid-business cycle levels. 

Rather than depending on an individual point estimate of BBSI’s intrinsic value, I have decided to provide a two-way data table based on forward 5-year growth rates and ending multiples. The cross in the table corresponds to multiples not expanding and trailing 5-year revenue growth being applied to my model. While I believe this is generally conservative, it still provides a 58% upside over current prices. Seeing that we are in the trough of the PEO business cycle, I do expect multiples to expand from their current lows, leading to the base case having significantly more upside than the above PT implies. Overall, this provides BBSI with a strong upside opportunity for those who have the time horizon to take advantage.

[Base Case Data Table](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamnormal/comments/gukar8/base_case_data_tables_bbsi/)

The core of any DCF performed during this crisis is that there is too much uncertainty to truly know what any stock should be “valued” at. I certainly do not know how the recovery will look, and it could vary greatly from the way I have laid it out in my current model. Rather than providing a point estimate of intrinsic value, I will provide two-way data tables showing ending multiples and forward 5-year growth rates. If you believe some of my assumptions are either too verbose or too conservative, the data table should provide you with enough of an idea of what other outcomes could look like.
 


&nbsp;


**Bear Case**

I have provided a bear case model as well, predicting slower growth rates coming out of recovery, as well as slower margin expansion across the entire 5-year period. This would imply a more structural shift away from small businesses that would be significant enough to harm the future of Barrett’s new business even beyond the COVID pandemic itself. Revenue would not surpass 2019 levels until Q4’22, and EBITDA would not get back to pre COVID levels within the 5-year projection horizon. 

With the shift away from branches as a source of unit economics, Barrett’s margins will be lower and take longer than my forecast period to return to pre-COVID levels. The 2020E financials would be worse than management predicts in their pessimistic scenarios, predicting negative income for 2020, which management has said would not occur even in their worst situations. I believe the probability of the base case is much higher than the bear case, but felt it was worth including to help frame some of the modeling assumptions I had to make in my base case model. 


&nbsp;



Assumption | Base Case | Bear Case
---|---|----
2020E EBITDA (thousands) | $8,678 | $(2,898)
2020E Operating Margin | 0.2% | -1.3%
2024E Operating Margin | 5.8% | 3.7%
5-year Forward Compounded Annual Revenue Growth | 3.48% | 2.49%

**Why does this opportunity exist?**

There are 3 primary reasons why this opportunity exists for us as investors, but only time will tell how long it will last before the margin of safety shrinks too much. BBSI has risen 16% since my original write up on 5/6, slowly eroding the long-term margin of safety this investment has.

•	**The COVID pandemic has caused a major disruption in labor markets across the world, including the US.** With unemployment skyrocketing to nearly 20%, the PEO firms will see significant hits in their billing due to fewer workers and fewer hours worked. The combination of these two factors will lead to decreased revenues, which has also kept the stock prices low.

•	**An unemployment shock is the trough of the business cycle for the PEO industry.** With sales declining as the base case expectation, they face headwinds in the short term, but tail winds in the longer term. The recovery will see the firms begin to build their businesses again as unemployment falls and the economy opens more. More services will be in demand, such as staffing, allowing some of the ancillary offerings to provide additional revenue support. 

•	**Many investors do not have the time horizon to buy at this point, as there is significant uncertainty regarding when the trough would end.** The shape of the recovery and the length of this period are heavy factors in the ability for investors to see BBSI as an advantageous long position. 

•	**This is a small cap company with little analyst coverage.** Trading at below $500mil market cap since February has knocked many investors off the trail of this company as it is below their mandates. There are typically only 3-4 analysts asking questions on each call, with only 3 sell side analysts publishing opinions.

t3_gvp5tb,What do you think of my DD on DraftKings (DKNG)?,"DKNG has gained a lot the week of May 24 2020, mostly focused on May 26 (Tues) and May 28 (Thurs). Both days saw intraday spikes on sports-world news. On May 26 afternoon, a presser with Gary Bettman was announced, and on May 28, it was announced that the Premier League would return in June. Oddly, the stock did not drop at all, after Bettman’s announcement turned out to just be an expanded playoff format, and nothing about a return to the ice. The Premier League news didn’t impact other sports betting stocks either. Both events clearly imply that DKNG’ stock is hugely overpriced, but it’s being driven up just by trading. I’m not affiliated with DKNG in any way.  

The company’s lousy Q1 earnings was quite the spin job, and I was shocked to see the stock rise that day! Growth in marketing expenses can be written off as entering new states, but no growth in net revenue, despite 30% growth in gross revenue, means that the company can’t actually grow. In other words, almost all revenue was grown by offering free bets and reducing vigorish. Let’s examine revenue growth further.

I was stunned that the company led with “30% revenue growth” when, in fact, that was only at Old DKNG, which constitutes 75% of New DKNG revenue. SBTech makes up the rest and grew at only 3%, giving the public company a 23% growth rate for the quarter, not the 30% spin job.
DKNG might’ve unintentionally unveiled COVID19’s impact. At Old DKNG, they noted 60% growth through March 10th. If we assume that each day through the quarter is equal, that means the last 21 days of the quarter would have been down 70% vs Q1 ’19!!! This difference is hefty! But we know not all days are created equal in the world of sports, and Q1 included 5 NFL playoff days and the Super Bowl. If we assume NFL betting days are 3x a normal day and the Super Bowl is 3x a normal NFL day, revenue post-March 10th will drop 95%. Similarly, because SBTech’s dropped from +19% to only +3%, revenue post-COVID19 will drop at least by half.

Also examine how they pitched themselves when the merger was announced in Dec. 2019. On slide 22, DKNG compare their valuation to competitors’, trying to show that the valuation is fair, probably trying to counter DKNG’s valuation that was4x what Paddy Power paid for FanDuel 18 months earlier. Let’s ignore the “EV / 2021E Revenue – Growth Adjusted” multiple that they highlight, because it’s completely unreliable to adjust a forward looking multiple based on your own forward-looking growth projections. Instead look at EV / TTM 3/31 Revenue for those same comparisons.

At $39 per share, DKNG has a market cap over $15 billion on TTM revenue of $451 million. So their revenue multiple is 33.7x, which is too overvalued! The “High Growth Consumer Internet” category that they selected is at 8.1x and “EU Sportsbook Operators” at 3.6x. Their best competitor is Flutter, which is Paddy Power + Fanduel + Stars, and it trades at 7.8x. DKNG deserves a higher multiple than Flutter because DKNG is pure-play USA, and Flutter earns retail European revenue that isn’t high growth. But the two companies currently have the same market cap, despite FanDuel competing directly with DKNG with more market share in the fast growing business segments. Even if you are generous to DKNG and believe they should trade at a 50% premium to Flutter, DKNG’s share price ought be just $13.50.

No, this isn’t about more states allowing sports betting. Let’s examine what must happen at the state level to value DKNG’s current valuation reasonably. In their December investor presentation, DKNG estimates their sports book net revenue at $2.3B given 25% market share and 65% of the US having online betting, with a 22% allowance for promos from Gross to Net. Consider their $4.5 billion of gross revenue at 100% of the population. Let’s bump that by 30% bump for iGaming. DKNG’s current $15 billion valuation and the same 50% premium to Flutter’s revenue multiple above (11.7x), mean that DKNG need $1.28B of revenue, or $831M more than they currently have. $831M more revenue needed means 14% more of the population must legalize in the very short term. Of the big five states, CA, TX, FL, NY and PA, none will add any population, because PA is already online, NY chose retail-only and researchers and lobbyists don’t think the other three will legalize for another 5 years. The remaining 46 states, including DC, average 1.3% of the population each, meaning you need a windfall of states to add 14% of the population.

Forget nationally legalized sports betting, because no one is even pushing for that and it won’t happen. SCOTUS invalidated PASPA to remove the Federal Government’s ability to make national decisions like (dis)allowing sports betting. Sports betting will roll out throughout the US, but will slog state-by-state.

Now that DKNG’s stock has rocketed, DKNA’s management has two good strategies, like TSLA did when TSLA's stock price rocketed in Jan 2020. 

1. The first is obvious: follow-on equity offering. In going public via a reverse merger with a SPAC, DKNG barely tapped the big institutional investors. This follow-on can add cash to the balance sheet. If you watched TV in 2015, you know DKNG love to spend money on ads, at a very attractive valuation for the company. What’s the problem? New shares, or if the follow-on prices poorly, can lower the current share price.

2. The less obvious option is to buy a competitor, William Hill, that has a market cap of about $1.5B. They have a huge footprint in Europe, a market that DKNG previously tried and  failed to enter. Europe threatens DKNG’ DTC approach in the US, and Europe has the IT that powers much of the land-based casinos’ sportsbook operations in the US. DKNG could buy them with their cheap stock, or issue new equity to raise money for the acquisition. DKNG would add much revenue, can cut lots of duplicated costs, diversify across countries and sports to temper their seasonality, and replace William Hill’s outdated tech with DKNG’s better apps. The downside is that these two companies’ CEOs dislike each other.

What’s one reason the stock has risen so much since the “IPO”? Because DKNG has a teensy number of liquid shares. Remember this wasn’t an IPO at all, it was a reverse merger with a SPAC, so a much higher percentage of outstanding shares [are currently locked up]( https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gscyrs/dkng_makes_no_sense_to_me_lots_of_thoughts/fsbn3fm/) than in a typical IPO. That constraint on supply with big retail demand could boost the stock price! I’ll summarize the 3 cases for DKNG. 

1. Short term bull: Sports come back, stock (irrationally) trades up on it.
2. Short term bear: Stock price corrects to a more realistic valuation. Bulls take gains. Any of NHL, NBA, MLB announce they won’t play again in 2020. Company decides on more financial maneuvering.
3. Long term bear: Q2 or Q3 earnings disappoint. The NFL cash cow drops or NBA or NHL ‘20-’21 season gets delayed. Lockup ends in October 2020.",24,0.78,1591168604,"[['DKNG', 16], ['TTM', 2], ['TSLA', 1], ['TV', 1], ['NBA', 1]]",DKNG,38.54999923706055,40.79999923706055

t3_h132ea,Carrier - Spinoff,"Recent spinoffs may present interesting opportunities during a market downturn, as these companies can fall due to simple neglect. 

One that caught my eye is Carrier. They were spun-off in April 2020. I'm sure many of you recognize the name. The company has somewhere between 10-20% market share of the U.S. HVAC market and it is either 1st or 2nd in market share (both residential and light commercial). Their investor presentation claims that they are the #1 competitor in commercial refrigeration (such as you might see in a grocery store) and refrigeration transport. It also claims that they are either #1 or #2 in the market for residential and commercial fire detection / alarm and security systems. 

The market price for their equity is $18.5 B. Their S-1 filing shows net income of about $1.5 B to $2.5 B from 2015-2019, meaning a P/E of between 7.5 to 12.5. Over the period, they earned roughly a 10% return on assets. Service / after-market is about 1/3 of their revenues.

MEANWHILE, the $10 B of bonds that they issued earlier this year are yielding between 1%-4%, which is pretty amazing for the corporate bond market. One of these bonds goes out to 2040 and another goes out to 2050. All are rated Baa3 by Moody's (equivalent to BBB- for S&P), so it is just barely considered to be ""investment"" grade. 

Pretty big gap between the apparent yield on equity and the yield on their bonds. 

On this superficial level, it looks like a good deal.

But their Q1 2020 results were pretty bad. $0.1 B for the quarter, 1/4 as good as Q1 2019. Caused primarily by lower product sales. They blame this on COVID-19. But I wonder to what extent their former parent company pumped up 2019 numbers in preparation for the spin-off. Their Q1 2020 presentation provides guidance for $1.7 B to $2.0 B of ""adjusted operating profit"" and >$1 B of free cash flow for FY 2020. Pretty speculative of them to even make a forecast on this, given how badly COVID rocked their Q1, and it being known at the time that they made the presentation that Q2 will probably be even worse. 

Their investor presentation mentions ""China expansion"" as a growth initiative, which makes me worried, but their overall theme seems to be that they are primarily focused on the nuts-and-bolts of their business.

But, this company has been around forever and HVACs are obviously needed, regardless of where we are in the economic cycle. Same is true for refrigeration and fire detection systems... though new product sales (2/3 of their revenue) is to a heavy extent driven by the homebuilding cycle. Perhaps the P/E is 15x earnings at the low point of the business cycle and 10x earnings at the high point of the business cycle. Is that expensive for a long-time market leader?

Thoughts? Would love to hear the perspective of someone who is deep into this industry.

t3_h84xbi,AAPL the compounder,"I was taking a closer look at AAPL, the $1.4 trillion market cap behemoth.

The business definitely qualifies as one with a wide moat as it consistently generates high ROIC and impressive margins. 

NOPAT and FCF growth has been consistent too, at around 5% CAGR in the last five years. 

The wide moat gives us confidence that AAPL is very likely to be able to generate this same CAGR in earnings going forward for the next decade.

However, buying it at 25x earnings today and exiting at the same 25x merely gives 5% CAGR. 

A consistent 5% CAGR over a decade is not shabby but not exciting and could be below the cost of capital for some investors. 

Am I missing something? Should we expect AAPL’s earnings to accelerate (and therefore perhaps have higher exit multiple too)? Or am I under-estimating the compounding rate of AAPL such that attributing 5% is too low?

In comparison, Berkshire bought into the company around 2016. Back then, Apple was compounding NOPAT and FCF at a similar 5% CAGR, with equally high ROIC. However, the PE was much lower at around 10 - 15x. 

I welcome some thoughts. Stay well and have a good weekend!",35,0.85,1592043441,"[['AAPL', 3], ['FCF', 2], ['ROIC', 1]]",AAPL,83.55500030517578,89.13999938964844
t3_had5ls,Verizon Analysis,"Hey everyone! I have been a lurker of the sub for a while. I just graduated (3 days ago from writing this post) from university with a degree in finance and I focused on classes where we analyzing companies as I find it very intriguing and I have actually found fun. This last quarter I took an equity analysis class and was pretty limited in what I was allowed to analyze, no FI's, or any equity analyzed in the last 4 years by another student. I ended up choosing Verizon as I thought it would be a start on learning and practicing. Here is my analysis and my hope is if any professionals out there would be willing to go through and give their input, advice, and be a critic on how to improve on my future analysis.

Some formatting may look funky as this was originally in a word doc that didn't exactly transfer over well.

Also I was forced to delete some tables and graphs due to the 20 picture upload limit, specifically I deleted MV of Debt calculations, some tables in the appendix representing WACC and cost of Equity, industry average statistics, which can be googled, my calculation of FCFE, as well as a few other minor tables, if the text refers to a table that isn't there that would be why, and I can provide to anyone upon request.

Thanks to anyone taking the time. I greatly appreciate it.

**Verizon**

6/16/2020

 Ticker: VZ 

Recommendation: **HOLD**

Price: $56.92  Price Target: $64.42

**Highlights**

· In the beginning of a 5g upgrade cycle, a significant opportunity to be a growth driver in the North American wireless market for Verizon.

· Verizon’s profit margin is at 14.61%, double compared to their competitors

· Stock market fluctuations low relative to the general market, a beta of .7, and a safe industry that many consumers deem as essential, relatively “recession proof”

· A dividend yield of 4.5% 

**Investment Summary**

**Dividend Growth**: The company is in its mature stage cycle with an established industry and market presence. Verizon has stable revenues with limited opportunity for growth outside of an acquisition of a smaller mobile carrier. This allows us to value Verizon mostly from its’ dividend growth. Historically, Verizon has a growth rate of 2.6% in the last 10 years, in the last 5, they have a historical growth rate of 5%. A growth rate of 3.5% is estimated to be Verizon’s growth rate moving forward. Fortunately, the industry business model allows for constant cash flow and sustainability in the mature stage cycle.

**Expansion:** 5g is the one of the few areas for growth still available to Verizon, 5g refers to the next generation in wireless data transfer technology. This new technology will increase data transfer rates by up to 100-fold. The last technological advancement with 4g impacted Verizon by increasing revenues by up to 5% one year and averaged revenue growth 4.3% annually for 4 years. This effectively doubled Verizon’s revenue growth average of 2.3% annually. Outside of 5g Verizon still has expansion options including expanding its wired FIOS network, and its online presence under Verizon Media Group. 

**Stability:** Verizon is a stable cash flow company with an adjusted beta of .7. This illustrates the safety of the company’s stock. Verizon has little room for growth in the saturated wireless telecom market, meaning Verizon’s stock price is not likely to explode in value in the future. However, historically Verizon’s stock price does not fall substantially relative to the general market when macroeconomic forces cause the market to fall. Verizon is not currently competing with other equities as it is with safe debt in our current economic environment. This is because of the current interest rate environment on the U.S. 10-year being less than 1%. This causes investors to look for other high-quality investment alternatives that deliver better yield. Verizon satisfies this type of investor with a yield of over 4% as well as providing market exposure from the general market.

**Execution:** The biggest potential obstacle currently facing Verizon is their execution of rolling out 5g technology. Any hinderance can result in missed revenue, with next year’s iPhone coming out with 5g capable technology, which the iPhone has over 50% market share alone in the smartphone market, could cause many customers to switch to a competitor if Verizon cannot meet demand by that point. Let alone the other half of the market, largely denominated in various android devices, already has 5g capable technology. Should Verizon miss the mark, it could potentially hurt the company for years. However, according to Verizon’s CTO, as of the end of May, they are ahead of schedule deploying 5g. Verizon has a history and reputation of being on top of deploying new technology quickly, while being ahead of schedule, it is plausible to see many customers switch over to Verizon to take advantage of their 5g if Verizon’s competitors can’t meet the 5g demand. Verizon management needs to be able to take advantage of this new technology by charging higher prices to their mobile customers. Any lack in the execution could result in bad revenues and earnings.

**Business Description**

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the parent company to Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group. Verizon provides services such as communications, entertainment, and information to consumer, business, and governmental customers. Employing 135,000 people, 96% are located in the U.S. and over 2,300 retail stores open, and headquartered in New York, NY. In 1877 the bell system was created in the name of Alexander Graham Bell, over time the company slowly expanded across the U.S. and Canada over the next 100 years. Over the years the system evolved to AT&T controlling a bunch of regional company’s providing land line service. In 1982 the U.S. government broke up the monopoly AT&T had into the regional companies, this plan was originally proposed by AT&T. This event was known as the breakup of the bell system and the companies post breakup were known as the “baby bells”. Two of the companies as a result of this breakup were Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp. Verizon was formed in June 2000 with the merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. based in New York city and GTE Corp. based in Irving Texas. Both firms were some of the largest in the industry, and both were heavily focused on the eastern side of the U.S. 

Table 1 below shows Verizon’s consolidated revenues for the years 2019 and 2018. Revenues are broken down into their three subsidiaries of Verizon Consumer, Verizon Business and Verizon Corporate. Eliminations refers to the exchange of cash between these segments as it is not new revenue. Below explains each segment and where each segment gets their revenue broken into a percentage.

Verizon Consumer Group offers wireless and wireline communications, branded the most extensive wireless network in the U.S., North America is where over 95% of their revenue comes from geographically, the other 5% comes from overseas in Japan, Central America, and selective parts of Europe. Wireline is provided in North Eastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. over fiber-optic lines through their Fios brand, or wireless services provided nationwide on hotspot devices or mobile phones. Both wireline and wireless can be prepaid or postpaid, the majority are in the postpaid segment, paying monthly for the services. The consumer segment provides data connection to 95 million wireless mobile connections, 6 million broadband connections, and 4 million Fios connections: making up 68.8% of revenues. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o1ev1ca08c551.png?width=349&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a2545cd65fb5a525145e02c3ba157034c8a0b60

Verizon Business Group provides the same services to corporate and some governmental agencies with additional services such as “video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products including solutions that support fleet tracking management, compliance management, field service management, and asset tracking” according to Verizon’s 2019 annual report. In all, Verizon’s Business Group is in a position to solve more complex problems that may come up at a business compared to their Consumer Group. Verizon Business Group provides 25million wireless connections and 489 thousand broadband connections: making up 23.8% of total revenues.

 Verizon Corporate includes media business, investments in businesses, and financing expenses outside of the regular course of business. The biggest section here is Verizon Media which provides third party entertainment services such as email, news, and streaming services to customers. Verizon Corporate makes up 7.4% of total revenues.

&#x200B;

Verizon plans to position themselves into future growth trends such as increased expansion of their wireless network, high-speed fiber, and the new introduction of high-speed 5g connections on mobile devices or in-home. With over 17.9 billion invested for capital expenditures at end of year 2019 for 5g technology release.

&#x200B;

**Environmental, Social, Governance and Management Quality**

Environmental criteria include the company’s impact on the environment such as energy use, waste output, and pollution production. In the last 10 years so called “green bonds” has been discussed more about and demand for them has slowly been rising. These green bonds are any bonds issued by a company, where all the money raised from the bonds goes towards any ESG related goal. Verizon in February 2019 issued their first green bond to the total of $1 billion, this is the first green bond issued in the telecom industry as well. Verizon has stated they are committed to being completely carbon neutral in their operations by 2035; this propagates their current goal to “generate renewable energy equivalent to 50% of our total annual electricity consumption by 2025”. Finally, Verizon has stated that they are committed to setting an annual emissions reduction target by fall 2021.

Social criteria include the relationships the company has with business partners, local communities, employee health and safety, and any other “stakeholder” that the company impacts. Verizon claims to focus on their customers upmost before most other stakeholders, they reinforce this through their actions and from their goal of being the best and most reliable network in the U.S. and serves this goal mainly through delivering high quality services through their wireless segment at a reasonable price. Outside of customers Verizon is aiming to contribute 2.5 million hours of volunteer work through their 135 thousand employees, these hours are aimed to improve “digital inclusion, climate protection, and human prosperity”. In Cleveland, Ohio the company is launching 5g enabled classrooms to deliver instruction in struggling middle schools and aims to expand this effort to 100 middle schools in total by 2021. Additionally, to evaluate the employee side of social criteria using a website called Glassdoor is used. Glassdoor is a website where current or past employees can rate the company anonymously on salary, benefits, satisfaction, outlook of the company, and their experience at the company; however, Glassdoor has been known to be biased at times. Verizon has over 21 thousand reviews on Glassdoor, from this large amount of reviews it can be taken with some accuracy. Considering all 21 thousand reviews they are rated at a 74% satisfaction rating, and 68% approve of the CEO, whereas AT&T has a 68% satisfaction rating and 51% approve of the CEO. At Verizon a controversial subject among employees are work-life balance with a 50% split on it needing some improvement or that it is adequate. Over 8,000 reviews claim that Verizon is a good employer when relating to pay and benefits.

Governance criteria includes how transparent and accurate the financial statements are, avoiding conflicts of interest among the executives and board members, and ensuring the company is not engaging in any illegal activities. As far as engaging in illegal activities Verizon has a good track record and no one suspects any major allegations against Verizon, with Verizon being a U.S. dominant business they mostly just have to obey rules and regulations within the U.S. and not balancing between international laws. Verizon has been clear in all of its financial reporting, obeying all GAAP rules and even going above the mark to provide additional information that is non-GAAP with disclosures. Conflicts of interest among the board members meet all laws and guidelines from the NYSE and NASDAQ. Verizon’s board members also meet the “heightened independence criteria” rules from the NYSE and Nasdaq. Regarding the green bond discussed above, they have and will report on how much of the green bond money has been spent and on what projects the money is going to until the note matures.

Overall Verizon is a quality company with quality management, among the 9 board members currently, 3 are African American, and 2 are woman. The company CEO, Hans Vestberg has been with the company since 2017, and CEO since 2018, a noticeably short amount of time compared to peers at AT&T whose CEO has been with the company since 2007. Verizon’s CFO, Matthew Ellis, has been with Verizon since 2016. Verizon’s management is relatively new and most likely experiencing a learning curve still, but so far, they have made strides in redefining Verizon and shows promise to be a strong team long term. Sustainalytics is an ESG rating company who rates companies on a scale of 0-100, they rate VZ at a score of 20, AT&T with a score of 19, and T-Mobile with a score of 25. This is a low score, however, ESG scores are highly subjective and vary widely among different ESG ratings companies. Verizon does not participate in any of the “high risk” ESG industries such as oil or mining, meaning in the grand scheme of company’s they are a relatively sustainable company. While the company can always do better, they aim to bring diversity to the company and strive for transparency. 

**Demographic Trends**

Companies should be aware of demographics and which ones their customers fall under, this information can provide to a company who their core customer base is, and which segments they can expand into. There are many demographics out there, each with their own preferences, tolerances, and taste. Gender, race, and age are the three big demographics, however, there are many more than those three and each can be combined or divided into bigger or smaller groups. Of particular importance to Verizon is age as there is a dilemma currently with an aging work force and how the transition to retirement will be in our society. Called the “Baby Boomers” they are by far the largest section of our population with the most buying power, many of them are about to enter retirement age. Many of these baby boomers are going to start to wind down their portfolios they’ve built up over the course of their lives. Over the next 50 years this population will naturally fade out and their immense buying power will switch to the younger generations. Currently the buying power of generations, while different studies vary on exact numbers, annual spending roughly comes down to about $550 billion for baby boomers, $350 billion for Gen X, $320 billion for Millennials, and $160 billion for the silent generation. The youngest generation, Gen Z, has little to no buying power of their own, however, their parents buy much of what they want with over 93% of households say that they influence purchasing decisions. Gen Z buying power will increase substantially in the future as they enter adulthood. Younger generations have been becoming more acclimated with technology as it has become more readily available and introduced at a younger age. Younger people (under 25) tend to use social media much more than older generations, most of these social media apps can only be accessed through mobile devices. As we observe these younger generations using technology more and becoming more affluent in them, we can assume that these kids will be more accepting of smartphones and other technologies; possible making these devices “essential”. 

By looking at Verizon’s customers we can predict where much of their revenue in the future will be coming from. Verizon’s customers, broken down by age, are as follows: 24.3% of customers in the 18-29 range, 26.1% in the 30-49 range, and 31.58% in the 50-64 range. Totaling our age groups, this accounts for about 82% of Verizon’s customers, the other 18% comes from the ages on the tail end of either side, so the under 18 or 65+ and the corporate customers who are unaffected by these aging demographic trends, there is not any percentage breakdown for these groups. As the 50-64 age group enters retirement they will want to stay in touch with relatives and try to keep busy, a phone is a good way to do this and it can be reasonably predicted that this age group will rise as the Baby Boomers enter retirement. Although this will most likely saturate the market completely and leave no more room for growth for Verizon in the U.S. market, aside from stealing customers from other providers. This effect will most likely be in the next 20-30 years, but at the 50-year time horizon this generation will have dwindled and the largest age of customers will shift to a younger age group.

“Younger people are getting phones”, says the CFO of Verizon at a Morgan Stanley investor meeting. At a younger age many kids are getting cell phones, this ingrains cellphones into kids’ heads and makes it an essential item. Under 18, the generation titled “Gen Z” (born after 1997) is now the largest population in the U.S. with over 90 million, larger than the millennial and Baby Boomer population. Who this generation chooses to have as their cellphone provider will likely depend on who their parents used, or other factors such as environmental sustainable governance ratings which seems to be a top factor within this age group. With this information we can assume that the under 18, and 18-29 age group will increase as young people get more phones due to an increase in population in this age group and the increasing likelihood that this group will obtain phones at a younger age. 

The Pew Research Center conducted a study in February 2019, they found that 96% of people in the U.S. have smart phones and that ethnicities, genders, education, and age seem to have smartphones at about the same levels; in the 91%-100% range. There is likely little market share to be gained by looking at demographic's trends over time other than the extremes of age, as the under 18-year-old are at 92%, and over 65 at 91%.

Currently with the Covid-19 virus shutting down the economy it can be safely predicted that Verizon will have a reduced earnings report through either Verizon delaying payments customers need to make to the company or writing off losses. Although many people see phones as a form of entertainment and people are craving entertainment now more than ever. As for long lasting effects coming about from the change of Covid-19, there may be a few that affect Verizon that are yet to be known.

**Industry Overview and Competitive Positioning**

At the beginning of 2020 in the Telecommunications Industry there were 4 big players, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint. T-Mobile and Sprint have merged as of 4/1/2020 into the company name of T-Mobile. Outside of Verizon the only one bigger than it is AT&T which is diversified outside of telecommunications such as AT&T owning streaming service and entertainment subsidiary HBO, and DirectTV a cable provider. With the T-Mobile and Sprint merger they are still the smallest of the 3 companies, but they are able to compete effectively with Verizon and AT&T. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are the “900-pound gorillas” of the industry.

The industry business operation consists of a provider offering data (or internet connection), and cellphone services to customer on a mobile connection, such as phones. Most of the company’s customer base pays month to month for service, included sometimes in the cost of the service will be a phone or other accessories (such as mobile hotspots, TV plans, or in home internet) that the customer bought with it. However, this makes it easier for a customer switching between providers for the better service as there is no commitment on the customer side.

Verizon’s revenues shown in the table below illustrate stagnant growth in 2018 and rather lackluster growth the other years. Verizon attributes this growth to expanding into new segments and upgrading infrastructure, as well as spending nearly 35 billion on new 5g technology, which is claimed to be revolutionary when it comes out.

Shown in the table below, Verizon has the lowest Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) P/E (Price/Earnings) ratio of 12.46, with AT&T being slightly higher at 15.14. T-Mobile absorbing Sprint has created a very high P/E ratio of 22.59. We can also observe that not only does Verizon have a lower P/E ratio, but they also boast higher return on equity and profit margins compared to their competitors.

**Valuation**

The discounted cash flow valuation methods used for Verizon consist of the dividend growth model, a free cash flow to firm (FCFF) model, a free cash flow to equity (FCFE) model, and a multiples analysis.

The cost of equity calculation is shown below, calculated to be at 7.62% using a 3% risk free rate and an expected market return of 9.6%. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) was calculated to be 5.4%, highlighting the extensive use of cheap debt, about 50% of their capital structure. Their average cost of debt on outstanding bonds was about 3.64%, much lower than what the required return on equity is, bringing cost of capital much lower.

***Dividend Growth Model – Constant Growth:*** Using a constant growth of dividends, and picking a growth rate of 3.5%, taking the average of the last 10 years we see an average increase of about 2.6%, and a 5.1% annual growth during the last 5-years. This will likely decline over an infinite time horizon, using historical data, as such an estimate of 3.5% is used to accurately reflect the economic environment. A 2.6% 10-year growth rate reflects the reality of coming out of the 07-09 financial crisis which does not reflect the current economic environment. This gives an intrinsic value of **$60.79**.

***Dividend Growth Model – Two-Stage Growth Model:*** In the past Verizon has had periods of high dividend growth for a year or two. The last time this happened was briefly after the widespread release of 4g in 2013 and the subsequent increase in earnings growth. From the recent developments of the highly anticipated release of 5g technology, in the two-stage growth model a dividend growth rate of 5% is assumed to be the average for 6 years and then settle at a constant growth of 3.5% indefinitely. This gives an intrinsic value of **$65.77** for the two-stage model.

***Dividend Growth Model – Three-Stage Growth Model:*** As for the three-stage growth model an assumption of an average of 7% dividend growth over the next 2 years, as in the past Verizon has experienced up to 11% dividend growth after the release of this new technology. After this, Verizon will settle into an average 4% dividend growth for 4 years, after which point, a 3.5% constant growth. This gives an intrinsic value of **$66.25** for the three-stage model.

***Free Cash Flow to Firm Model:*** Verizon’s free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) represents the cash flow available to all of the company’s capital providers, this includes bond holders, common shareholders, and occasionally preferred shareholders. Verizon’s actual FCFF is very volatile at first glance, fluctuating between -43% to positive 226%. Most of this volatility is from high amounts of investments of working capital into projects, as is the nature of the business. However, it seems that the cash flows are also very unstable due to Verizon’s taxes in 2017 with the huge tax cuts Verizon was able to get -$9956 (mils), FCFF was significantly affected. Substituting the 2017 tax number to a Verizon average tax payment of $5000 makes FCFF seem much more stable. Averaging out over the course of 5 years, an average of 8% growth in free cash flow to the firm is calculated. In the constant growth model, a growth rate of 3.5% is used. This is from an assumption that one day Verizon will wind down working capital and be able to achieve more stable cash flows. In the two-stage and three-stage models a slightly higher growth over the next 6 years because of the release in 5g technology significantly increasing the growth is used. The average growth rate for the two-stage model is estimated to be at 5% before settling back down to 1.5% growth rate. In the three-stage growth model an estimate of 8% free cash flow growth for 3 years, a 2.5% average for the next 5 years, and then settle back into 1.5% growth. This gives an intrinsic value for constant growth, two-stage, and three-stage models of **$110.57**, **$146.38**, and **$153.58**, respectively.

***Free Cash Flow to Equity Model:*** Verizon’s free cash flow to equity (FCFE) holders represents all cash flow available to common equity holders after all operating expenses, bond payments, investments into both working, and fixed capital have been made. Over the last 5 years FCFE has grown on average at 4%, however, the per year change is also very volatile, much like FCFF. Three separate years had negative FCFE of around -70%, and our other two years had positive 1,393% and 307%. This is mostly due to paying down debt rapidly or taking out a lot of debt to fund new projects such as 5g rolling out, mainly the latter. Taking out net borrowing from the calculation creates a more stable model, as such net borrowing is taken out and a growth rate of 10.3% is calculated. As such FCFE growth rates are estimated to be slightly lower than the average because while taking out net borrowing shows more stable cash flows, repaying the debt will lower cash flow available to common stock. That said, in the constant growth model a growth rate of 4% is used. The two-stage model a growth rate of 7% for the next 6 years, then settling to 4% for terminal value. In the 3-stage model an estimate of a 10% return over the next 3 years and a 6% return for 5 years, before settling into the terminal growth rate of 4%. This gives an intrinsic value for the constant growth, two-stage, and three-stage      
 models of **$106.35**, **$124.20**, and **$135.29**, respectively.

***Multiples Analysis:*** In this valuation approach a price/earnings (P/E) ratio and enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratios are used. Through the P/E approach, Verizon currently has a P/E fluctuating between 12-13 and historically they have had P/E’s up to 20 in the last 5 years. Their competitors AT&T and T-Mobile have P/E ratios roughly around 15 and 20 respectively, and the industry standard is P/E is 15. Verizon has an earnings per share of $4.43; however, with 5g technology becoming widely available, a modest earnings growth to $4.90 per share (a 10.6% increase) is estimated for next year. This calculation leads us to an intrinsic value of $73.50. As for the EV/EBITDA approach, Verizon’s current EBITDA is $47,152 and with a ratio of 8.2. With an estimated EBITDA value of $49,500 and a target ratio of 9, this calculation gives us a value of **$76.08** one year from now.

***Valuation Summary:*** Verizon is a company with stable cashflows and without much room for significant growth. This makes Verizon perfect for a dividend growth model valuation and is the most accurate of the three models. FCFF is confusing and hard to estimate because of the massive tax changes year to year. FCFE is misleading as the huge amounts of borrowing throws off calculations as net borrowing is not typically used as funds available to shareholders, as such net borrowing has been taken out of the analysis. A growth rate reduction of 2-3% is used for FCFE to account for the reduced cash flow available to common shareholders resulting from paying off the debt in the future. The multiples analysis shows that Verizon may be undervalued currently with a P/E ratio hovering around 12, significantly lower than the industry average and peers. In all the dividend models are most accurate as investors in this company value the stable cash flows and dividends. To arrive to the final intrinsic value estimate, a blend of the three dividend growth models is used, with a 30% weighting on the constant and three-stage growth models and a 40% weighting on the two-stage model. This weighting provides a final intrinsic value of **$64.42**.

**Financial Analysis**

**Liquidity** – As of March 31st, the most up to date financial statements available. Verizon’s liquidity is poor, Cash as a percent of total assets is only 2.3%, although slightly higher than the last 5 years of around 0.9%, this influx of cash is most likely a response to the Covid-19 epidemic. The cash came from 7.5 billion of new debt, all of which expires before 2020. Doing a Current Ratio, and Quick Ratio for Verizon (Current Assets / Current Liabilities and Current Assets – Inventory / Current Liabilities respectively).  This calculation provides poor numbers, with the current ratio being at .991, and the quick ratio being at .952. This shows that Verizon has way more in liabilities than assets, and if they needed to sell off assets quickly and liquidate the company, in case of a bankruptcy, they would not have enough to meet their obligations. Although due to the nature of the business this is extremely unlikely and as discussed below the debt is manageable. This is further reinforced via the Net debt to EBITDA ratio, a common way at to measure if the amount of income generated is available to pay down its current debt. Any number higher than 4 or 5 typically raises concerns, however, Verizon is well below that number as of now and shows adequate debt management.

**Profitability Ratios** – Verizon has a profit margin of 14.6% in 2019, effectively doubling their 2014 profit margin of 7.6% shown in the table below. Return on Invest Capital is also very high number at about 46% and Return on Equity slightly lower at 31%; however, these ratios have fallen the past 6 years from 114% and 78% respectively. This dramatic decrease is attributed to the payoff of massive investments into 4g technology in 2014, and now we have much lower percentages due to massive investment increases into 5g spending. These ratios will most likely return to much higher numbers over the next 2-3 years.

\*Equity Multiplier\* refers to Assets / Shareholder Equity-1 and Sustainable Growth Rate g\* uses Equity Multiplier\* instead of Equity Multiplier, Equity Multiplier uses Assets / Shareholder Equity of the same period.

**Debt** \- Verizon is levered at about 2 currently, although they have reduced that from 9.2 in 2014. This means that Verizon has double the amount of debt than they do equity. Their debt ratio is at .79 currently, although that has dropped substantially from .95 in 2014. Debt ratio illustrates what portion of the company’s assets is owed to creditors. Currently most of this debt is used for various infrastructure costs for 5g, as well as introducing a new “Green Bond” for environmental social governance, the first in the telecom industry. Using market values rather than book values, Verizon has a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The times interest earned ratio is currently at 6.44, meaning they currently make more than enough in operating income to pay for interest, so they are not currently at risk of defaulting. As well as their times burden covered for 2020 at 5.28, allowing Verizon to be rated as investment grade bonds.

**Asset Management Ratios** – Shown above in the second table, asset turnover is at about 45.2% currently, although this number is misleading as they sell a service and accumulate assets over time without having to sell them to customers. Shown in the table below is collection period, inventory turnover and payables period, with collection period and payables period having risen between 2014 and 2019 from 40.19 to 70.39 and 40.92 to 51.52, respectively. This shows that Verizon has been extending receivables at a faster rate than payables, ideally, Verizon would like to see that reversed. Supplier terms are currently unknown for Verizon, however, payables period being under 60 days, they are still getting favorable terms. Inventory turnover has decreased slightly from 43 to 38 since 2014, which is promising and shows more inventory going out the door.

  As for industry averages, it is shown that Verizon has a much higher quick ratio and a lower times interest earned (TIE). The leverage ratio, and debt to equity ratio is about the same as the industry average. In some ways Verizon company is close to industry averages with the exception of being slightly more levered currently. 

&#x200B;

**Investment Risks**

**Debt Levels and Credit Rating:** Verizon currently has debt levels equal to about its market capitalization, meaning the company nearly has just as much debt as it does equity outstanding. These high levels of debt represent significant risks via Verizon’s obligations. A single quarter of abrupt cash flow disruption could force Verizon into default on much of its outstanding debt. The high debt levels Verizon currently deals with could potentially lower their credit rating with the credit rating agencies. This would be detrimental to Verizon as it would affect their ability to introduce new debt at low rates, and hurt Verizon’s profitability.

**Geographic:** Currently Verizon mainly operates in North America. This provides significant systematic risk on the part of Verizon. Terrorist attacks, regulation change, or any other factor that could negatively affect the North American region is a significant risk to Verizon. 

**5g:** Any delay in the release of the 5g network could significantly hurt Verizon’s business. This technology is new and is creating rapid change within the industry that Verizon must be a part of moving forward or risk losing customers to a competitor. Introducing new technology also means that they must phase out old, unprofitable technology on a cost-effective basis or else Verizon is at risk or having reduced profitability.

**Competition:** With the recent merger of T-Mobile and Sprint into T-Mobile there is a much more competitive landscape for Verizon. Before the merger, the only real competitor in size was AT&T, now with the merger Verizon has two competitors of similar size. The merger is particularly dangerous to Verizon as the company is not diversified outside of the industry like AT&T, and a new significant entrant into the industry could pose a huge threat as T-Mobile will be able compete with Verizon on a more cost-effective basis than previously.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** The two biggest factors affecting Verizon’s stock price are identified as the change in the cost of equity, and the change in the dividend rate. This is because in the dividend discount model the future dividends are discounted by the cost of equity and the annual dividend rate shows how the stock price will change given all else is equal. Shown below are the changes in the cost of equity and dividend rate plus or minus 2% and 1% and how it effects the stock price. For the cost of equity calculation, it is important to realize that rising interest rates, changing expected return in the market, or a change in the volatility (beta) of the stock could affect our cost of equity, and in turn, our intrinsic value. As for the change in dividend growth rate, will easily affect a change in our intrinsic value calculation by changing the projected future cashflows. Below in table 1 illustrates both possibilities and the potential impact on the calculated intrinsic value. The most probable of these two is a change in the cost of equity as the economy is currently in an extremely low interest rate environment, and the cost of equity calculation assumes a 3% interest rate. Changing the rate to the market risk free rate could substantially raise intrinsic value; however, our 3% assumed risk free rate more accurately reflect what investors expect, and not the artificially pushed down price shown in the market right now.

 **Cost of Equity**

Calculating the cost of equity by using a risk-free rate of 3% as current U.S. 10 year bond rates are at all time lows and has a possibility to not accurately reflect the actual cost of business within the U.S. for Verizon. Using an expected return on the market of 9.6%, which is the average annual return in the stock market going back to 1928. Finally, using an adjusted beta of .7. The cost of equity is calculated to be 7.62%

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital**

Finding the market value of long-term debt by taking 43 long term bonds Verizon currently has outstanding and took the current price each bond trades at. Using this information, the market value of long-term debt from these bonds was found but does not reflect \*all\* debt. Taking the average price each was selling at, weighted by amount outstanding, multiplied this average by the book value of debt to comes to MV of LTD of $129,747.73 billion.

To find the pretax cost of debt by taking the yield on each bond weighted by percent of total debt, summing this up a cost of debt to Verizon of 2.69% was calculated.

To find the weighted average cost of capital follow the above formula. Spelled out is: weight of equity x cost of equity + weight of debt x cost of debt x 1- tax rate. The calculated weighted average cost of capital to be 4.7%. This accurately reflects the cheap use of debt Verizon takes advantage of as the cost of equity is significantly higher at 7.62%. This is how Verizon should be funding its operations as this substantially lowers their cost of capital and they can sustain this sizable amount of debt through the stable cash flows as is the nature of their business.",78,0.98,1592342756,"[['GTE', 2], ['Z', 1], ['TV', 1]]",GTE,0.3799999952316284,0.38999998569488525

t3_hbd5lc,How do you look at ROIC for asset light businesses?,"Hello everyone!

I use NOPAT / (NWC + PP&E + other tangible assets ) to calculate ROIC of business,

If I want to evaluate capital deployment skills of managers I also include goodwill and intangible assets in denominator, but most of the time I’d like to know ROIC of business.

Problem is that for asset light companies (tech) which has negative NWC, IC is approaching to 0 making ROIC close to infinity, or even IC is negative.

What’s your though process in this situation?

\-Do you include only tangible part in IC ignoring negative NWC ? Cause tangible part is still important.

\-Or do you use other metric cause ROIC is not relevant for asset light business – if business double it’s IC (offices, computers, etc) you can’t expect NOPAT to double.

Basically I understand that negative IC/asset lightness is good, especially while business is growing. But I can’t understand how to evaluate “how good is it” and how to use it as comparable metric between asset light businesses cause once IC negative/close to 0 it does not makes sense as denominator.",19,0.9500000000000001,1592481126,"[['ROIC', 5]]",ROIC,11.220000267028809,11.369999885559082

I have no track record. I am just a dude sitting in his pajama's looking at stocks. Never buy a stock because of my, or anyone's suggestion for that matter.

Do your own research. Lynch put it best: ""At $10 I called my mother. I said mom you gotta look at this Kaiser Industries, I mean how much lower can it go?"". That's the situation you want to be in, calling your mother to ask how much lower it can go rather than dumping the stock because ""Panic!"". I frequently call my mother to ask how much lower a stock can go. Sometimes she gets angry because it's 4 AM and I forgot it's the Hong Kong session, but the moral support of ""Stocks always make you lose all your money, sell now"" really helps.

1.38 B Gross sales - 0.28 B Cost of sales = 1.10 B Gross profit (Estimated around 79% gross margin).

&#x200B;

Kewei Granules: Same active ingredient, not in capsule form. The company has a patent on this product.

69.40% of total sales in 2019, sales increased by 166% in the year 2019 when compared to the year 2018.

3.67 B Gross sales - 0.60 B Cost of sales = 3.07 B Gross profit (Estimated around 83% gross margin).

This product recently passed the Consistency Evaluation process.

The Chinese patent office lists the patent as having been filed/approved 2006. No duration mentioned. From my limited knowledge patents in China last 10 or 20 years. The company writes down patents over a 12 year period, the company states that the patent on this product lasts until 2026. This is entirely believable with a 20 year patent protection on a patent approved in 2006.

There is an interesting drug in development, Recombinant Human Insulin. China is huge, and has a population that already has a very high rate of Diabetes. As the Chinese become wealthier and start adopting the SCD (Standard Chinese Diet... basically Standard American Diet in China) we can expect this to skyrocket even further. Many might know that Japan is extremely focused on maintaining lower body weight for its citizens, and that Japan has a relatively good situation when it comes to the health of it's citizens, especially when compared to the USA. Yet Japan's rate of Diabetes is still 7.9% of the adult population. China is already at 10.9% and increasing, but even in a best case scenario ending up with a Diabetes rate of around 8% of the adult population would still produce a huge domestic market.

This is all just a possibility, and I am not taking this into account in my valuation due to the various obstacles and uncertainties involved in gaining market share. It is, however, something to keep in mind as a possible hedge against the risk of Kewei losing market share in the future. This is a 25 RMB Billion market, even 10% market share would be game-changing.

Returning value seems to be high on the companies' agenda. Maybe a little too high. Dividend of 0.72 HKD per share is not something I consider good (not a fan of dividend in general), but there have also been large share repurchases at low stock price. Recently the company cancelled 1% of total shares outstanding. These shares were purchased at an average (pre-split) price of around 29 HKD. This translates to 14.5 HKD average adjusting for the stock split. They are better at buying cheap than I am, which makes me feel insecure. The fact that they paid 40 HKD average for the last batch of 1% of total shares makes me feel much better. An average of around 34.5 HKD still isn't a bad repurchase price (17.2 HKD after stock-split).

&#x200B;

**Edit 20/06/2019:**

Corporate structure:

Some clarification with regard to the shares and ownership.

There's 2 types of shares. Domestic Shares and H-Shares. H-Shares are on the open international market and traded on the HKSE.

The Domestic Shares are fully owned by the majority controlling company, Shenzhen HEC Industrial, which controls 50.4% of all shares (100% of Domestic Shares) through a network of subsidiaries.

The company has no single founder with a large shareholder position. Management has worked in various of the other companies in the Shenzhen HEC Industrial group.

Shenzhen HEC Industrial has a large interest in selling patents/new drugs to the company, with the company having ""pre-emptive"" rights to obtain new patents and rights to sell from the research oriented subsidiaries of Shenzhen HEC Industrial.

Risks:

Losing market share in Oseltamivir Phosphate: This would be a death sentence due to the company's reliance on this product.

Market meltdown and increasing political tensions between China and the USA: However, the company is quite insulated against these risks. The company proved impervious to the last recession in China (2015-2016), however, worst case scenario assumptions do conclude stock price could go down significantly (Can't they always?).

Coronavirus: This is probably the biggest reason the stock is down so much. It's almost certain the company was affected, but considering how essential medication is I doubt this would influence the long-term value significantly. The risk is should the coronavirus have truly hit this company hard there could be a nasty surprise in September when the Interim report comes out. This is not an out-of-this-world assumption, considering Hubei province was ground-zero (5.5% of sales, also research/development operations there).

Convertible debt: I don't like this, but the company has had a very good financially conservative track record, with debt usually being paid off quickly. Convertible, though. Eww.

Big trouble in big China: I have good faith in China and it's system, but not everyone seems to. China does have additional risks related to how things work differently there and that many of investors abroad might not fully comprehend all of these nuances and are therefore at risk of making a bad decision regarding investments in China.

That's it. I'm a simple guy that looks at stuff simplistically. Maybe a bit too simple? I also didn't want to go too far into extremely basic stuff like Balance Sheet. Putting up debt/etc for the last 10 years would add minimal information, despite the fact that I took it into account. All that matters is they have high debt now, but have paid off debt aggressively in the past. I consider dividend payouts with debt a definite negative though, would've liked to see that dividend go towards paying off debt but you can't have it all. Finally, sorry it turned out so freaking long. I even left a lot that was of ""meh"" importance out because it would've turned into a book.

Subject me to the most brutal criticism you have. I shall now go read random stuff on the internet before dissecting the entire Korean Stock Exchange since I'm quite burned out from looking at every single H-Share company and staying up all night on Friday to buy this.

t3_hbx6ht,ScS Investment Thesis,"**Update 22/6:** I decided not to invest in the end. I still believe the margin of safety is there, but I don't think the risk/reward payoff is as good as a couple of other companies I've been considering. The major shareholder selling off shares came very quickly after the very long-standing CEO announced his retirement. Those two things may not be connected, but when considering companies without moats, the quality of the management is of the utmost importance and not knowing who that team will be led by next year at a time where there could be a difficult trading period for the company left me with more uncertainty than I'd like.

Firstly, this is all just my opinion and research- the numbers may be wrong, what I infer from the numbers may be wrong and this is not a recommendation for you to buy, it's me looking for feedback on my thesis as I'm considering buying shares (but I haven't yet done so).

**Business Overview**

ScS is the UK's second biggest upholstery company with 9.3% of the market. The biggest is DFS with 32% (25% from DFS and 7% from Sofology).


ScS’s market share has grown sporadically since its 7.9% share at IPO in 2015.


As well as selling sofas, the company also sells flooring, although on a much smaller scale. Flooring revenue for H1 2020 counted for 12% of gross sales. It is in a much worse market position here as the 8th biggest supplier. Its market share has dropped in H1 2020, which it attributes to unsustainable pricing from Carpetright and another flooring retailer and its preference to sell less volume at a profitable level than participate in a pricing war.


The business had gross sales of £333.3 million in the year end 27 July 2019. This comes from selling sofas (£274.2M, +1.2% YoY) and flooring (£42.3M, -1.2% YoY) from their 100 UK stores, as well as selling online (£16.8M, +21.7%).


As well as operating from their 100 owned stores and website, the business previously ran 27 concessions in House of Fraser that equated to 8% of sales in 2017 which were shut in 2018 after House of Fraser went into administration. The closure of these concessions has muddied the waters of the business’s historic financials. ScS is slow-growing in terms of revenue, so the HoF closures turned what would have been 2% growth in 2019 to a 5% decline.


**Nature of the investment**

I don’t see this is a cutting-edge business with high growth potential and a strong moat. I do however see it as a business which is currently selling below intrinsic value based on 2019’s financials and even with no share price appreciation, the dividend yield alone is appealing. Given the nature of this investment, I believe it is most important to focus on the financial management of the company and the risks/threats to the business to ensure the business is capable of handling market downturns and maintaining market share.


**Financial Management**

The business appears to me to be run very conservatively, especially when compared to its closest peer- DFS. They ran a debt-free operation until drawing down £12m from their revolving credit facility in March to ensure sufficient liquidity throughout the lockdown. Upon reopening 80 of their England stores on 23rd May they announced that they had cash of £48.3m (including the £12m RCF) and although the directors gave no guidance on the months ahead, they expressed their confidence in their liquidity, ability to weather the market downturn caused by COVID-19 and return to growth ‘when the economy recovers’. It is worth noting that as the business receives cash upfront and pays suppliers afterwards, a significant proportion of that £48.3m (if not all of it) will be required to pay suppliers, so this measurement definitely overstates the company’s liquidity.

**Risks/Threats**

The two main risks here are that the total upholstery market shrinks, or the company’s market share shrinks (or both).

_Total upholstery market shrinks_

The current upholstery market size is £3.2 billion. Pre-2008 it was higher, peaking at £3.92 billion in 2007. Its lowest five year average was from the years 2010-2014 where it averaged £2.96 billion. Estimating owner earnings for these years (assuming today’s 9.3% market share and making some assumptions around which expenses are static at today’s levels and which scale with spend) I arrive at an intrinsic value for the business of £65 million. This is using my 15% minimum acceptable rate of return. This suggests to me that even a permanent reduction in the size of the upholstery market won’t result in losses, providing the business holds market share.

However, in the last few years where the market has decreased by 3%, non-House of Fraser revenue has increased by 8%, more than offsetting this decline. If this trend continues, even in the face of a permanently reduced market, I believe the business is undervalued.

_Losing upholstery market share - through market disruption (i.e. the Amazon effect)_

Given the high price points and the long-term nature of the purchase, as well as one of the most important features being comfort, sofa sales don’t lend themselves well to online-only retailers. Amazon had 1.9% of the upholstery market in 2019, which was 0% growth on the previous year. Whilst it's never wise to count Amazon out, the current low price of the shares means that according to my calculation of owner earnings (discounted at 15% rate), we would have broken even on our investment in 5 years. Yes, Amazon may take market share, but ScS are rapidly growing online sales themselves and within a 5 year time period I don't see Amazon as a major threat to their business.

Whilst I'm confident Amazon aren't an existential threat, the uptake in online purchasing can't be denied. Most customers report researching online prior to visiting a store, and the proportion of customers who do buy without visiting a store (10% according to DFS in 2019) is indeed rising. The main risk I see here is that ScS are behind the curve on online retailing. They attempted to purchase sofa.com, but this fell through. I believe that improving their own SEO (in a cost-efficient manner) would be far more useful than purchasing another online retailer. I've read an SEO analysis of the UK sofa industry, specifically comparing DFS and ScS that stated ScS was far behind the curve in terms of generating traffic for its site, and concluded this with some of my own naïve research of searching for various keywords and seeing whose ads and organic links show up. Regardless of the business's SEO setbacks, they are still the second biggest player in the market, so given the amount of research customers reportedly do when purchasing a sofa, I find it unrealistic that the average consumer wouldn't come across ScS's site during their online research- especially if as the majority of customers do, they intend to complete their purchase in store. Additionally, although branded searches can be described as rising or falling depending on the pre & post periods used for ScS, over any time period they appear to be far outpacing growth in DFS although doing so from a much smaller base; the same can be said for online revenue growth.

_Losing upholstery market share - DFS_

DFS as a group is the much bigger market share threat in my eyes. DFS (including Sofology) have a market share 3.4 times that of ScS, and due to the growth of Sofology outpacing ScS, this is likely to increase further (although this is partially offset by DFS’s core brand declining in market share). If we believe there are moats at play in the upholstery retail business, we should be very wary of DFS as a competitor. Marketing expenses aren't trivial in this business, and with a larger customer base, DFS will certainly have efficiencies of scale there. That being said, it is ScS, not DFS with the highest conversion of revenue into operating profit at 4.6%, compared to DFS's 4.1%. That's despite ScS having gross profit margins 10 p.p. lower than DFS- however, it is hard to tell how much of this is due to DFS attempting to grow quicker than ScS through new store openings.

I therefore think it is prudent to further split this risk into two areas:

_Sofology market share growth_

Sofology’s current trajectory of market share looks set to overtake ScS somewhere in the region of 2022 to 2023. It’s unlikely that much of this will come at the expense of ScS due to Sofology’s more high-end offering (DFS have also mentioned that Sofology has had little cannibalisation of DFS’s core business), but it will certainly bolster the DFS group’s position in the industry.

I am therefore content that ScS need not worry about Sofology’s expansion too much. The real threat Sofology brings is if it provides extra capital for DFS’s core business to fight ScS in a price war.

_DFS core business market share advantage_

For whatever reason, DFS don't appear to have been able to use their increased market share to dominate ScS in terms of either profitability or more growth. Their most recent half year results note that although their core brand revenues are declining, they historically have grown market share during market downturns. It seems unlikely to me that this growth will come at the expense of ScS given the value-oriented nature of both suppliers and the trends of both businesses over the past five years.


It's hard for me to put a causal driver behind DFS's core brand market share decline (perhaps their management is stretched too thin across multiple smaller brands or they are spending too much time looking for more acquisitions, perhaps they've just had bad luck with their store placements being in areas of worse consumer confidence), but I'm content with seeing ScS's revenues grow amidst a shrinking market whilst DFS's are shrinking.

_Losing flooring market share_

The flooring market seems to be more volatile than the furniture market, and ScS’s position within this market has been very volatile as of late. ScS introduced flooring into their product mix in 2012, and since then it has grown rapidly to account for £42m in gross sales. From 2015 to 2019 (inclusive) sales had grown at a rate of 20%, 5%, 7%, before decreasing by 1% in 2019 and 13% in H1 2020 (this ended at the end of January 2020 so this decline was pre-coronavirus).


I'm reminded of the quote 'the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent' here. The current market environment will undoubtedly have resulted in many companies trying to sell off inventory at record-low prices when stores reopen. I believe that management has the right attitude towards trading, reminiscent of how Warren Buffett approaches insurance. Whilst they'll likely further lose market share in the short term, if Carpetright are forced to close stores, ScS would likely benefit substantially from that. Also, even modest growth in sofa sales would offset major declines in flooring as evidenced in H1 2020 where gross sales grew 0.5% despite the flooring decline.",2,0.75,1592556363,"[['DFS', 12]]",DFS,52.56999969482422,51.0

# BKNG: Optimistic valuation side-steps possible travel recovery mishaps.

**A QUICK HISTORY**

Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) has been a fantastic investment as globe-trotting travel becomes an accessible lifestyle. $1,000 invested in 2010 would have become $9,170 by the decade’s end. In the wake of the Great Recession, individuals’ buying power has exploded thanks to online platforms/aggregators. Consequently, offline channels’ demise (e.g. [Thomas Cook](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thomas-cook-grp-investment-explainer/thomas-cook-collapses-why-and-what-happens-now-idUSKBN1W804O)) has further contributed to growth, however market-share theft begins to slow – as travel agencies cease operations. The homogeneity of options available further favours **BKNG**’s business model, however the rise of Airbnb might contradict that. Further travel trends of the past decade can be read [here](https://skift.com/2019/12/31/2010s-the-decade-travel-lost-control-of-its-destiny/).

**BUSINESS MODEL**

&#x200B;

[Table 1: Operating margins of select firms operating in sub-sectors of Travel and Tourism.](https://preview.redd.it/o0d5piytvv751.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c01206c1786337eb581e5c4716afda061619693)

High margin opportunities are rare within Travel and Tourism (“the sector”). **BKNG** possess a high-margin business model, serving a typically low-margin sector.

Booking Holdings’ portfolio contains market leaders, differentiated by business model and/or geography.

* **Booking.com** | The pièce de résistance. It is the [\#1](https://www.similarweb.com/website/booking.com/) travel platform across USA and Europe.
* **Agoda** | Ranking [\#4](https://www.similarweb.com/website/agoda.com/), as market leader in East Asia.
* **Rentalcars.com** | [\#1](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/travel-and-tourism/car-rentals/) platform-only (unlike Enterprise and Hertz) car rental aggregator.
* **Priceline.com** | The once flagbearer of aggregators, focussed on US and Canada.
* **KAYAK** | Successor to **Priceline.com**. USA and China are top markets.
* **OpenTable** | Restaurant booking and management services in primarily USA and Canada.

In Western markets, notable competition remains Expedia (**EXPE**), whilst Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) focusses on Asia. Its distinct businesses highlight their aspiration of “[the connected trip](https://skift.com/2019/12/03/what-does-online-travel-really-mean-by-a-connected-trip/)”, where a universe of services delivers an end-to-end vacation experience.

Revenue segments explained:

* **Agency revenues** | Commission taken without handling of payments – e.g. the “booking” and the “sale” are disparate.
* **Merchant revenues** | Commission is taken in addition to payment processing, fees etc.
* **Advertising and other revenues** | In-site advertising (“featured”); referrals fees by KAYAK; and bookings management services provided by OpenTable.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: BKNG revenue streams.](https://preview.redd.it/rp2f45e8wv751.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23a063ca382c6b421441c0933ead12aec0a1849c)

Aggregators suffer from low differentiation, meaning that KAYAK nor Priceline are dominant, however remain important for directing users to platforms (such as Booking.com or Agoda). Ownership or minority stakes encourages aggregators to selectively direct.

* Expedia (**EXPE**) has stakes in Despegar \[Latin America\] (**DESP**) and Trivago \[Europe\] (**TVGO**).
* Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) has stakes in Tongcheng Elong \[China\] and MakeMyTrip \[India\] (**MMYT**).
* Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) has stake in Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) – there’s always a bigger fish!

It’s dominant position worldwide combined with its vision make **BKNG** an attractive business.

**SHORT-TERM: AFTERMATH OF A PANDEMIC**

""I believe the COVID-19 virus will impact global travel more than the 9/11 terror attacks, the SARs epidemic and the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis combined.""*Glen D. Fogel, CEO of Booking Holdings (April 2020)*

This may sound fear-inducing but in reality, this statement says very little. Modern tourism has shown remarkable [resilience](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/book/10.18111/9789284414444) to past shocks. Like past crises, COVID-19’s impact can be separated into two hurdles to be overcome: the initial shock and the tail. The tourism-related impact events mentioned by Fogel are assessed.

* **September 11th terror attacks** | 1-day event created uncertainty of global travel, using aeroplanes. The sector generally recovered with 1 year, but NY tourism took [longer](http://www.modul.ac.at/uploads/files/Theses/Bachelor/BYSYUK_Impact_of_9_11_on_US_and_International_Tourism_Development.pdf).
* **2002-2004 SARS Outbreak** | Multi-year regional outbreak however Chinese tourism was not globally significant, accounting for [3.2%](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284406647) of all spending vs. [20%](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152) today.
* **Global Financial Crisis** | Sector ramifications felt later, however growth returned in [2010](https://www.unglobalpulse.org/project/economic-crisis-tourism-decline-and-its-impact-on-the-poor-2011/).

These events lack global severity or were felt over either the short-term or long-term. The [2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami](https://www.britannica.com/event/Indian-Ocean-tsunami-of-2004) characterises a shock event with long-term sector damage. All nations within the region [recovered](https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/EID14/EID14015FU1.pdf) by 2006, apart from worst-hit Indonesia where visitations returned by 2007. This is further testament to the sector’s ability to withstand the most brutal of events.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Variation in online traffic of select travel websites.](https://preview.redd.it/pvnb7gbrwv751.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=733932754a9a77ce73a35dd11ecf8ca1c4633e7f)

Further, [online traffic](https://www.similarweb.com/website/booking.com/) indicates a recovery. European-focussed platforms (HRS.de) and automotive rental platforms (Rentalcars.com & CarRentals.com). Regardless, average visits are down 70% since January, even after a May rebound.

This information may be received as comforting; however, the short-term outlook continues to remain choppy. A full sector recovery in 2020 is unlikely. The majority of BKNG sales stem from hard-hit USA and Europe, which [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/974548/when-will-travel-and-tourism-recover) predicts will not share a Chinese-style rebound. Moreover, consider the seasonality of booking periods. Vacations are normally booked 100-150 days in [advance](https://supercontrol.co.uk/the-bottom-line-on-bookings), implying – under normal circumstances – vacations up to September are mostly accounted for. Heavy sector discounting will spur some, but the importance of 1H sales remains undeniable.

&#x200B;

[Table 2: BKNG quarterly sales for 2019A and 2020E.](https://preview.redd.it/11rg2lmwwv751.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdde2b761e50593fcb2cd7249b5961cbd8a054fa)

The above table presents a Base scenario revenue change of -52.68% in 2020. Assumptions are made in blue.

**LONG TERM: AFTERMATH OF AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN**

The second sector-wide question refers to when will normality resume – indicated by sales resuming to 2019 levels. Research by [Wedbush](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3572209-booking-holdings-not-v-shaped-story-wedbush) points towards a multi-year recovery.

[Table 3: Modelled scenarios for BKNG post-coronavirus recovery.](https://preview.redd.it/lyfiay5dxv751.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06f543fc99bcc413ce66b9b284dcea935ddf29a)

Beyond, when focussing on the long-term prospects of **BKNG**, its fate is tied to, namely, sector growth and competition.

The exemplary track record of **BKNG** tells one possible story. “A rising tide lifts all boats” tells another possible story. As globe-trotting tourism becomes attainable to half of the world’s households by [2025](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/partner-with-us/documents/global-travel-and-tourism-insights-by-visa.pdf), sector growth is expected to outpace economic growth.

&#x200B;

[Table 4: Travel spending forecasts \(Visa, 2016\).](https://preview.redd.it/1yyjwe9hxv751.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=9260f1ff403aa9266e5e4ad2993afc78e4944f02)

If **BKNG** is to capitalize on this, capturing the Asian market is crucial. Chinese dominance will extend – only 10% of the population are passport holders; forecast to be 20% by [2027](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152). Agoda is the market-leader here, however strong liquidity enables inorganic growth levers to be pulled. The then Priceline Group acquired Booking.com in 2005 for $135M; a drop in the ocean compared to their current balance. With low interest rates, this should offset risks brought by increased debt.

When assessing competition, mode of booking (i.e. online) is unlikely to change, however preferred platform may. Management and others’ [concerns](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/google-moves-travel-expedia-group-ceo-calls-level-playing-field-search-results/) are mainly directed towards “Big Tech” firms Facebook (**FB**) and Google (**GOOGL**), due to their ability to integrate travel booking into other products (e.g. Google Maps). Low switching costs mean Booking Holdings’ established presence will provide little defence against the [2nd most valuable global brand](https://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/list). Antitrust concerns in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_vs._Google) and the limited presence of “Big Tech” in Asia provides **BKNG** with valuable time to strategize a defence. Further, medium-term tailwinds are unlikely to be derailed as a result.

[ Figure 5: What customers value the most from online travel platforms. Useful when assessing the comparative advantages of Booking Holdings’ platforms against peers.](https://preview.redd.it/paa525anxv751.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=937aaba07609077e10030780cdd4b30d0ac3ce43)

**VALUATION**

&#x200B;

[Table 5: Overview of comparable companies. All ratios taken from Reuters, on an annual basis.](https://preview.redd.it/x5h2l047yv751.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6526ac85a6e83d489539f2bfcb0c72dfe3f560)

**BKNG** and peers have been reluctant to issue forward guidance. As investors look beyond 2020, 2021 forward earnings will be used to arrive at a current valuation.

&#x200B;

[Table 6: Multiples approach to valuation for BKNG.](https://preview.redd.it/soid9babyv751.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a8851f2a6f8d12c3c7c41de09659effb7fd378)

Current valuation favours a 52.68% 2020 revenue decline and a 2022 recovery. Trading around $1,600 provides little room for error. A decline to sub-$1,400 levels would provide suitable entry.

* **Short-Term** | PT: $1,400 | HOLD.

&#x200B;

[Table 7: DCF approach to valuation for BKNG. Values accurate as of market close, Fri 26th June 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/9uifg0tfyv751.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=16f2ba57b79575930fd31137b2219d6d4c31f5a3)

Notable DCF assumptions are noted:

* **Tax Rate** | Remains at 21%.
* **Risk-free Rate** | 0.70% (US 10Y T-Bill, 19/06/2020).
* [**Perpetual Growth Rate**](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG) | 2.74% (50Y avg. OECD members GDP growth, 1968-2018).
* **Perpetual Operating Margin** | 35.00%, similar to FY2019.

Regardless of the scenario, there is little difference in DCF valuation. Perpetual growth used is conservative given sector growth, and discount rate(s) reflect current market reality. A current share value of below $1,600 seems reasonable, when taking a long-term view on an investment providing an expected annual return of approximately 7.5%.

* **Long-Term** | PT: $1,600 | BUY.

**CONCLUSION**

The “travel bug” is not a Western phenomenon. The continued rise of Asian holidaymakers will solidify this. COVID-19 has rattled tourism and will crush near-term earnings, yet Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) possesses sizable competitive advantages in the following ways:

* Dominant position, globally.
* Respected platforms, and a [proven ability](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/priceline-changes-name-to-booking-ceo-weighs-in.html) to pivot focus to the top performer(s).
* Low-cost, high-margin business model.
* Long-term tailwinds within a resilient sector.
* Strong financial position. Cash balance comfortably covers 2020E expenses. Inorganic growth possible.

**BKNG** has proven to be a well-run business. Despite this, the market has shown its ruthlessness. As such, a 15% pull-back to attractive short-term levels is possible. For the long-term **BKNG** investor, competition will continue to be fierce. Booking Holdings arguably won the battle for the West. Whilst attentions will turn east, they must be careful not to lose focus on “home turf”. In Asia, Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) remains their biggest threat, however in the early stages there will be spoils for all. Lower sector growth is also concern, however unlikely. Yet, investors should take comfort knowing in a scenario where expected perpetual growth halves, **BKNG** remains within the short-term PT. Investors ought to continue loving vacations as much as everyone else.

t3_hjihas,Can we discuss non-standard valuation methods? Sometimes used on non-standard assets?,"I am very interested in valuations of different asset classes. We were all taught the **basic valuation methods:**

* Discounted Cash Flow model -  Really only useful for a mature, stable company like a utility or a JNJ.
* Relative Valuation/Current Multiples -  P/E, EV/EBITA, P/FCF, etc.
* Precedent Transactions - The cost companies have paid in the past for comparable companies
* M&A Premiums Analysis – Analyzing M&A deals and figuring out the premium 
that each buyer paid, and using this to establish what your company is worth
* LBO Analysis – Determining how much a PE firm could pay for a company to hit a
target IRR

-----

Then things start to get wonky. Here are some **little less used methods:**

* Dividend Discount Model - stock is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments, discounted back to their present value
* Residual Earnings Model - Useful if the company doesn't have predictable dividends (or none at all
* Future Share Price Analysis – Projecting a company’s share price based on the P/E 
multiples of the public company comparables, then discounting it back to its present
value 
* Real Options on assets such as ""drug patents and mining or oil/natural gas rights""

**For Energy Only:**

* Multiples- P/MCFE, P/MCFE/D (where MCFE = 1 Million Cubic Foot Equivalent, MCFE/D=MCFE per Day), P/NAV

Note from /u/APIglue on using MCFE: ""Don't use MCFE, ever. The BTU ratio is stable, but the price ratio is not, and has never actually been 6:1. You have to value the oil and the gas separately. You should get more granular and value things on a per-field basis (or more) because the per bbl costs and sales price varies so much.""

**For Retail & Airlines Only:**

* Multiples - EV/EBITDAR

----

**Distressed firms:**

* Liquidation Model
* Sometimes you look at valuations on both an assets-only basis and a current liabilities-assumed basis. This distinction exists because you need to make big adjustments to liabilities with distressed companies.
* Valuing Equity as Options 

**Pre-Revenue /Early Stage Companies:**

* Venture Capital Method
* The Dave Berkus Valuation Model
* Bill Payne's Model
* Risk Factor Summation Method
* Replacement Method or ""All-In"" Method
* Rule of Thirds
* Current Value Method - Only used when (a) no material progress has been made on the enterprise’s business
plan, (b) no significant common equity value has been created in the business above the liquidation preference on the preferred shares, and (c) no reasonable basis exists for estimating the amount and timing of any such common equity value above the liquidation preference that might be created in the future
* First Chicago Method

**Private Equity Securities (that have several share classes):**

* Current Value Method (focuses on the current value. Only useful when acquisition/dissolution is imminent)
* Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (PWERM)
* Option Pricing Model (OPM)

--- 

**For REITs only:**

* Public REIT Multiples: P/FFO and P/AFFO
* Net Asset Value (NAV) Model  - Forward NOI/ Cap Rate and add in all their other Assets, subtract their Liabilities, and divide by the share count to get NAV/share
* DCF with Levered FCF (not as common)
* Dividend Discount Model (not as common)

**Real Estate (property level):**

* Replacement Cost method – you estimate how much it would cost to re-construct the property
* Multiples -  NOI/Cap Rate (commercial), $/Sqft (residential)
* Comparables or Comps for residential properties: properties in the same area that have the same sqft, same bed & bath, etc

**Ship/Tanker Assets:**

* Market approach (FMV)
* Replacement cost
* Income approach
* Hamburg rules
* PFandbrief Act

----

These could all be used in a:

* Sum-of-the-parts valuation - Using a combination of the methods above, you break the company into its different P&Ls and value each of them individually. Sometimes in combination with the ""conglomerate discount""


---

Now... can we discuss maybe some even LESS known valuation methods or valuation methods for assets that are not common? How or what is done to value them? For example, I saw a company that pays out people a guarantee for litigation that hasn't happened yet but then they keep all the proceeds if they win. Essentially by pooling a lot of cases together, they can get a confidence interval of the rate of success and value of settlements/awards and then take an arbitrage on that. That is one hella of an alternative asset play imo.

What do you guys got? Any good stories? Any different or weird valuation methods I didn't cover?

t3_hl7svg,Oroco Resource Corp TSXV: OCO," Oroco Resource Corp.

TSXV: OCO.v 

OTC:  ORRCF

Note: This company has been evaluated very thoroughly by others. I am relying heavily on work done by others and linking to this work. I’m not writing a full analysis, just wanted to share an idea.

What is Oroco?

Oroco Resource Corp is a junior mining company based in Canada with majority interest in the Santo Tomas Mine. This is a large Copper porphyry deposit located in Mexico. 

&#x200B;

Junior miners are usually a good way to throw away money,  so why is this one different?  

**Santo Tomas has proven reserves. This is not common.** It was drilled decades ago and samples have been re-assayed multiple times as the mine has gone through various ownership. A typical junior miner needs to prove their reserves. 

&#x200B;

Why does the opportunity exist?  

Many of the world’s desirable copper assets have been developed or acquired by major mining companies in the last two decades. During this time Santo Tomas had been in legal dispute. This is now resolved and Oroco has received majority interest in the project and the mine is registered to a subsidiary.

The second reason is that the information we have on the mine is historical. This means it does not comply with current standards. Once a compliant drilling study (43-101) is complete, the mine will be marketable.

&#x200B;

What am I actually buying?

The company has a detailed Santo Tomas technical report published on their website: [https://orocoresourcecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/ST-DAB-2019Aug22-Revised-2020Apr21-Final-red.pdf](https://orocoresourcecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/ST-DAB-2019Aug22-Revised-2020Apr21-Final-red.pdf)

A few highlights from this report…

* “At a 0.35% CuT cutoff grade, the results show a higher‐grade component of mineralization that consists of 333 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.437% CuT, for a total of 3.20 billion pounds of copper.”  (note: this alone makes  the asset attractive)
* “At a 0.15% CuT cutoff grade, the results show a large historical mineral resource of 822 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.322% CuT, for a total of 5.84 billion contained pounds of copper.”
* Half of the drilled segments ended in ore. Meaning there is more there than was measured.
* The company has purchased land surrounding the original concession.

&#x200B;

What is worth?

Caesar’s report did a nice NPV model: [https://caesarsreport.com/freereports/CaesarsReport\_2019-09-18.pdf](https://caesarsreport.com/freereports/CaesarsReport_2019-09-18.pdf)

At $2.75 copper,  they estimate $1.25 billion NPV. 

At $3 copper, $1.66 billion NPV.

These are estimates based on historical data of course. 

&#x200B;

What’s next?

Continued development of the resource. The company recently finished a private placement. These funds are being used to complete a 3D-IP study of the mine. This data will help characterize existing known deposits and guide future drilling. Drilling will require a further capital raise and be the next step. The company will be most marketable at this point. 

&#x200B;

Pros?

The company trades for $82M CAD. NPV of the mine is at least $1.2B. 

Reserves are clearly under-evaluated. New land acquired and existing holes were not drilled to sufficient depth.

Copper is a long-term play. This mine could last 40 years.

Santo Tomas is close to infrastructure (rail and deep water port). It is in a developed mining district and the country has an incentive to keep this area safe/developed.

&#x200B;

Cons?

The mine is in Sinaloa, Mexico. No reported incidents thus far, but security risk exists.

AMLO has a populist bent and this creates some political risk.

Reserves need to be proven. Although we have the benefit of previous drilling.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts are appreciated.  A full write up of this company would be extremely long and technical.  If interested, Mariusz Skonieczny has done some great work on Oroco over the last couple of years. I recommend starting with his website or his videos on the subject: [http://classicvalueinvestors.com/2020/06/16/oroco-part-1-how-i-learned-about-santo-tomas-copper/](http://classicvalueinvestors.com/2020/06/16/oroco-part-1-how-i-learned-about-santo-tomas-copper/)",29,0.91,1593886202,"[['NPV', 2]]",NPV,14.369999885559082,15.140000343322754
t3_hnm5na,Proving corporate innovation is declining in a chart. Ideas?,"Hey everyone. Would appreciate some hive mind input here. The objective is to prove a hypothesis that corporate innovation in the US is declining and the R in corporate R&D spend is effectively being outsourced to VC's. I don't have access to a Bloomberg terminal but here is my idea:

* Get total R&D expense to sales (which I hope is declining over time).
* R&D is rarely broken-out (right?). So to proxy my hypothesis that R is falling relative to corporate sales, we can use M&A activity as % of CFO or something. 
* If M&A activity is increasing but R&D is flattening or falling, we can infer that new R spend is effectively being outsourced to VC's. (i.e. buying up the winners at series-b round)
* Breakout using any of the S&P 500 sector ETFs as whole SP might be wacky. Pharma, for example, will likely look way different (right?)
* There could be one hangup whereby off-balance-sheet corporate VC obscures a trend. 

Any thoughts?",5,0.78,1594231908,"[['R', 2], ['SP', 1], ['VC', 1]]",R,37.130001068115234,43.790000915527344
t3_hwynx7,Moat investing simplified: summer project,"I am a college student who is interested in investing and am working on a summer project to make investing, specifically long-term investing in stocks, more accessible to the everyday person.

As part of this project, I wanted to brainstorm and breakdown companies using a simple, systemic framework that is easily understood and digested by beginners while still allowing them to see the bigger picture. It is not to learn about every single detail about a company, but to share/record relevant information for someone to invest for the long-term.

This framework consists of analyzing a company's competitive advantages (moats), potential, risks, and valuation.

This is probably common knowledge to you guys but I'm just going to breakdown the categories for consistency and clarity.

Moats:

* Low-cost producer Ex: Walmart can undercut the prices of local grocery stores because of their efficient supply system and the fact that they buy their products in bulk.
* High Switching Costs: When switching from Apple products to Android products, it is notoriously difficult to transfer files and photos from one device to the other.
* Network Effect: As more people join Facebook, the platform becomes more valuable because users now have more people to connect and interact with.
* Intangible Assets: Brands, (patents, trademarks, and copyrights), government approvals, or a geographic advantage. Ex: Starbucks can charge a high price for its coffee products and thus make lots of profit because they can uphold their brand reputation so effectively.
* Efficient Scale or toll moat: Only a few players can enter a market and be successful. Mastercard's competitors, namely Visa, have no interest in undercutting Mastercard as doing so would only hurt their profits and margins. Instead, they function in a healthy, stable duopoly to preserve their market share and profits. This grants high barriers to entry for any company trying to enter the payment network space.

Potential:

This section is to be filled with various reasons that the company is expected to grow in the foreseeable future. This is great for identifying if a company seems to have the ability to grow for the long haul. Below are various categories/examples of potential:

* Product Potential: If a company can continuously innovate and make revolutionary breakthroughs/innovations in their products. Ex: Tesla's cars are improving every year with better batteries and a self-driving system that makes itself better the more data it acquires.
* Market Potential: If a company can expand its market to new horizons. Ex: The iPhone SE has allowed Apple to start making the iPhone more accessible to the middle class, effectively allowing them to access a new part of the cellular device market due to its lower price point.
* Business Model Potential: Changing the business model to ensure that the company keeps its footing within the industry. Ex: Boeing transitioned from making the majority of their revenue selling aircraft to servicing/repairing them.

Risks:

Various risks go along with any company, and I believe that correctly identifying and evaluating these can make or break whether a company is a worthy long-term investment or not. These risks can be broken up into two distinct categories: external and internal risks. That is, risks that happen outside of a company versus risks that come from within.

A couple of external risk examples include:

* Competition: Samsung went from having 20% marketshare in China vs. 1% in just five years because of the likes of huawei, xiaomi etc.   
* Government Regulations and Restrictions: Since Lockheed-Martin, a private military contractor, has its biggest client as the US government, their revenue that comes internationally can come to a halt it the US government decides to sanction a country that makes up a significant portion of their international revenue.
* Unforeseen Event Risk: COVID-19 has been detrimental to the majority of businesses. AMC theaters, for example, have forced AMC theaters to close all of their theaters until further notice, which has stopped all of their revenue.

A couple of internal risk examples include:

* High Debt: Since AT&T has recently acquired both DirecTV and Time-Warner, they have a high amount of debt (around $160 billion) that will take a substantial amount of time to pay off, and it must be predicted whether or not they will pay it off.
* Concentrated Revenue: Since around 50% of Apple's revenue comes from their iPhone sales, if their sales were greatly reduced, this would be detrimental to the company's revenue.

Valuation: Any methods/metrics that seem relevant plus an approximate margin of safety price

Here is an example of my own breakdown on Apple:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr790iG6U3xQbUJ5sVKYRBXyhTVpQV\_Sdkb5S55LbY0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr790iG6U3xQbUJ5sVKYRBXyhTVpQV_Sdkb5S55LbY0/edit?usp=sharing)

**\*** These categories (especially for potential and risks) are by no means the only ones available, and I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can think up of any other effective categories for any of the four company factors that I listed above. Also, is this system flawed and ineffective, and if so, how and where is it ineffective?**\***

Thank you for reading this far. If you have any questions or if anything is unclear, don't hesitate to ask. I am openly looking for constructive criticism, so any sort of feedback will be extremely helpful.

t3_hxo5n4,Has anyone tried to rationalize the stratospheric rise of $TSLA in the past 6 months?,"The company just announced $26B LTM revenue, and $300M LTM profits; it's market cap is $260B. That's 10x P/S and 86x P/E; if you ignore the fact that $400M of that profit was from emission credits (i.e. back them out and it's $100M in-the-hole). 

At the beginning of the year it's share price was $433; today it's $1,417. That's >300%.

In it's latest quarter, it posted revenue growth of -5%, which is very positive news given the circumstances; gross margin of 25% (18% ex-credits; same YoY). Let's assume everything below gross profit is growth CAPEX, i.e. gross margin = net margin. It sold 90,000 cars last quarter, i.e. about 400,000 cars over LTM. Assuming average unit revenue of $69,420, that's about $7B LTM profit, or about 37x P/E. Reasonable enough.

What happened between Jan 1, 2020 and July 24, 2020 to justify a 300% increase in stock price? Coronavirus happened. TSLA managed to sell nearly as many cars as it did last year... how? It's selling durable goods, and durable goods don't sell well in a recession, one that is particularly special this time around since nobody is driving. In end-2019, used car prices were declining, which should mean less new cars sold; so in mid-2020, in the middle of a recession, TSLA is selling... around the same number of cars? Maybe in China where things are back to normal...? I dunno.

What else happened in the last six months? They're building a new factory in Texas, and one more in Germany. Of course they're also building one in China; but everyone already knew that last year. Cybertruck was announced late-2019, so that's not the reason. Youtubers and tech sites have begun reviewing the Model Y... okay let's attribute 100% to that. That leaves another 200% unexplained.

Self-driving? No news since last year, except that the Autopilot alpha build can now drive Elon from his house to work; it was supposed to be Level 5 by now. Tesla Semi? Huh what? Future autonomous taxi network? That was last year's news, so it should have already been in the price. India being the new China? Maybe in 2050, nobody's buying massive quantities of Model Y's in India soon. There has been no revolutionary developments in the EV space in the past 6 months. 

Battery? Solar roof? 

Let's give the benefit of doubt and assume all the above assumptions hold true: the 25% ""net margin"", the fact that revenues barely dipped in the worst auto environment of the past decade, the fact that we are in a freaking recession. Add all that up and it still barely explains why the assumptions in the share price should alter by 300% in 6 months. 

Any guesses? I'm sure I'm missing something.",49,0.89,1595689490,"[['TSLA', 3]]",TSLA,282.6000061035156,301.9620056152344
t3_i0eubv,GME: Undervalued?,"This is my first analysis on a company. I wrote this analysis for myself to understand GME after reading that Michael Burry has a large share in GME. I have no ownership in the company yet, and do not have any formal training. I would love to hear everyone's feedback and thoughts, as well as advice for what I could do better, mistakes in reasoning as well as any constructive comments/criticism. Thanks in advance!


**Fundamental analysis of GME**

**Premise:** GME is fundamentally undervalued (at least for the short term) and will reflect it’s true market value upon release of the next generation of xbox and playstation consoles.

**Argument 1:** Stock price is cyclical, tied to the release of new games/consoles. Xbox has released consoles in 2002, 2013, and 2017, and upcoming in Q4 2020. Playstation has released consoles in 1994, 2000,  2006, 2013 and PS5 in Q4 2020. Both companies have released variations of the current brand in between time periods. GME stock value has generally reflected sales during these times. The performance of GME in 2017 onwards is due to - 64.2% revenue over the past 5 years as a result of no new consoles and a trend towards digital games.




**Argument 2:** Pricing of the stock is below market value which was determined by: (Assets - Liabilities)/(outstanding shares) gives us $9.44 a share. Yet GME is currently marked at 4.50 a share.

**Explaining the low pricing:**

GME is currently being priced as if it is headed toward bankruptcy, rather than its intrinsic value. Market sentiment is that brick and mortar has been hammered by the online industry (amazon, ebay etc). The high expectations of of online retail over brick and mortar has caused people to shift resources and attention towards online retail and technology which has resulted in the following:

1) An overvaluation of technological/online companies. For example Intrinsic value of Amazon (based on free cash flow) is 33% lower than it’s current share price. The higher pricing is due to the promise of amazon as an online retailer but amazon unperformed brick and mortar by a large margin for the past decade. 


2) an undervaluation of brick and mortar stores (amazon is currently generating $2 billion in profit, and has had many unprofitable years in the past decade, while walmart has profited $129 billion) in 2019 alone.



3) Pessimism reflected by the market due to covid 19, where the expectation is that brick and mortar will be hit hardest and online will thrive, but over 2/3 of stores were able to continue operating albeit with modified procedures (curbside pickup, online orders). Additionally GME online sales have spiked 1500% during covid. 

4) Low emphasis on stockholders. In the past GME has not put tremendous emphasis on delivering shareholder value. However in recent months Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, both significant investors in GME with 7.3% holding have recently won 2 board seat nominations for Paul Evans and Curtis Wolf, who have promised to redirect efforts towards shareholder value by changing the companies focus on long term performance and by extension unlocking shareholder value. Strategies by management include: reducing costs, shift towards a long term strategy and alignment of compensation with performance, a historically neglected aspect resulting in investor frustration.

I don’t think this is significant, but it is worth noting that management does see value in the company, albeit in the face of significant structural changes.

**Arguments against:**

1) Can GME survive until the December release of consoles?
- yes, they have $500 million in liquidity, and a yearly operating cost of 2 billion, ample to support the store until console releases.

2) will the market reflect GMEs value once sales are up?
Unknown. I’m not certain of this.

3) What advantage does GME offer over walmart and Bestbuy for sales of consoles?

Unknown, GME may have higher pricing than its competitors and a wider assortment of games and accessories. I don’t find this convincing however. See #4

4) Underperformance of console sales. 

There is the potential for consoles to flop, but i don’t think this is viable given the improvements in technology, how long it has been since a new console was released, increasing work from home/stay at home population due to the pandemic and affordable pricing.

Additionally - covid has spiked GME online sales by 1500%, which is a positive sign for the retailers potential. 

Historically, consoles have sold out upon pre-orders becoming available, i think this trend will continue into the next generation of systems.

5) The move to digital:

Digital relies on heavy internet speeds and storage, both practically unavailable right now.

**Conclusion:**

GME is currently under-priced due to a combination of low confidence in management, the expectation that online will take over brick and mortar, historically unfavorable treatment towards shareholders and future expectations of bankruptcy. However intrinsic value of the company is over twice it’s current pricing. The company has enough liquidity to support themselves through the console cycle and bankruptcy fears are unjustified. The company's change in management along with upcoming console release gives the potential for GME to return to its intrinsic value, generate profits and return to a fair market value.

Current Market Cap: 63.9M

Share Price: 5.65

Shares outstanding: 11.5M 

**INTRODUCTION** 

Founded in 1998 by Ralph Bartel, Travelzoo is a niche travel and local deal aggregator/advertiser. The logo appears unchanged since the 1999 internet boom. For two decades, they have published a top 20 list of deals on travelzoo.com. The company works with 2000 companies worldwide and reports approximately 31 million “members”. Members are individuals who are subscribed to their email notification service. 

In early 2020, the company acquired Jack’s flight club, an airline deal notification subscription service. Jack’s is primarily based in the UK, but expansion to the US is being rolled out. The founder’s brother, Holger Bartel, is the current CEO. The company has high insider ownership, relatively low float and a history of share buy-backs. 

**Travelzoo.com**

Travelzoo revenue is derived from paid listings on the top 20 list and other parts of their website. Advertisers include hotels, resorts, airlines, travel agencies, and regional tourism promotion organizations. They also sell vouchers to various hotels and resorts in a similar manner. The clientele is deal motivated. They tend to do well in off-peak seasons and are able to generate demand when better deals are available. International competitors include Secret Escapes in the UK. 

From 2016-2019 revenues have ranged from 106M to 111M and income has ranged from 3.53M to 4.66M. 

*Good co. / Bad co.*

TZOO makes money in the US and Europe and has historically lost money in Asia. The losses from Asia have been hiding a solid US/Europe business. 

2019 Net income of 4.1M included losses of 8.1M attributed to Asia/Pacific. The business ex-Asia produced 12.2M.

**Jacks Flight Club**

A 60% acquisition of Jacks was completed  in early 2020, with an  option to acquire the remainder in January 2021. They are a large player in the flight deal alert industry. They scan flight data for good deals and send these out to members. Free membership is available. Members can also pay $49 a year for premium service which provides more prompt deal notification. The service is for deal motivated individuals, similar to Travelzoo’s core business. 

Several competitors exist in this space. The barrier to entry does not appear particularly high, however the niche has already been swallowed by a few major players (Scotts, Jacks, Dollar flight club, and a few others). A simple breakdown of how these deal services operate from someone creating a local competitor: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bbl35x/how\_and\_why\_im\_taking\_on\_scotts\_cheap\_flights/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bbl35x/how_and_why_im_taking_on_scotts_cheap_flights/)

Jacks has a greater than 80% operating margin. 60% ownership would have contributed 2.2M in earnings. By 2/2020 100K UK travelzoo members signed up for the free service

US rollout happening

**Covid-19 and why is there an opportunity?**

A worldwide pandemic has obviously caused severe adverse effects upon the entire travel industry. Travelzoo’s shares accordingly sold off in March 2020. The founder, Ralph Bartel, also incurred a margin call during this time, which placed further selling pressure on the share price. Shares eventually hit a low of $3.04. Shares have since recovered a bit but remain at prices similar to previous multi-year lows. 

*Bye Bad Co.*

In March 2020, the company swiftly decided to end Asia/Pacific operations. The Japan business was sold to its managing director (with Travelzoo keeping some interest) and the remainder of the Asia/Pacific business was closed. In a normalized environment this would have unlocked tremendous value.

*Now and forward*

The company briefly pivoted to favor favoring sales of refundable vouchers which surpassed expectations. The company holds on to these funds until redemption. The flexibility of the deals has helped uptake despite covid-related uncertainty. Since then, they have returned to a historical balance of advertising and vouchers. 

Revenue has suffered greatly since the onset of the pandemic. Q2 revenue declined to 7M from 26.6M in 2019. Travel fears and restrictions simply limit the amount of people traveling for leisure. Travelzoo has been able to offer tremendous value to its members during this time. Deals to the Maldives, Galapagos islands, and Antarctica have been seen at amazing prices. Most deals extend into 2021 and occasionally beyond. 

Travelzoo has responded to the revenue decline with impressive cost cutting measures. A large portion of the company’s expenses are related to selling/marketing and Travelzoo has been able to react quickly.  Furthermore, they have used this opportunity for structural improvements. CEO Holger Bartel recently stated that ongoing operating expenses are expected to be \~60M ( \~88M in 2019) with the ability to support normalized revenue. Cash balance has increased to 27M, partially due to increased voucher sales. They expect return to profitability by end of fiscal year 2020.

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Value realization will occur with travel normalization and if the company is able to return to pre-covid business. Expect a sooner return to travel amongst Travelzoo’s deal focused customers, however full return is unlikely before 2022. Many deals will continue to be available to Travelzoo customers, as destinations are eager for customers. Pent up demand should help as well. Balance sheet is very manageable.

I will use a value with a simple multiple of earnings calculation. Historic P/E has averaged 14. We can use a P/E of 10 for safety.

2019 income, simply excluding Asia/Pacific = 12.2M.  P/E of 10 = 122M valuation. 

*(share price = $10.6)*

Full acquisition of Jacks = + 3M in earnings. 15.2M.  P/E of 10 = 152M valuation.

*(share price = $13.2)*

(Potential growth for Jacks is not taken into account. This could add real value. However, we should also assume near term impairment. )

Cost cutting of 28M is a large unknown. If this is sustainable, the potential is upside enormous. 45M. P/E of 10 = 450M valuation.

*(share price = $39)*

**Conclusion**

Travelzoo revenue is down and shares have sold off. Several structural changes have since occurred, including closure of the money losing Asian business and significant structural cost-cutting. These changes alone should unlock tremendous value. However, this is all masked by the overhanging Covid-19 situation which limits travel. Until this resolves, it is a waiting game.",16,0.92,1596388757,"[['TZOO', 2]]",TZOO,6.130000114440918,6.789999961853027

t3_i6k3ic,Why the Teladoc-Livongo Merger Makes Sense,"I'm going to use this article by Richard Chu of Saga Partners as a jumping-off point:  [https://richardchu97.substack.com/p/teladoc-and-livongo-a-merger-that](https://richardchu97.substack.com/p/teladoc-and-livongo-a-merger-that) 

Basically, the short version of his bullish thesis for the Teladoc-Livongo merger is that it will disrupt the healthcare industry, which is currently built around **treating** diseases (particularly acute diseases); by using new technology to significantly reduce overall healthcare costs, through: 

\- prioritizing **preventing** diseases before they become serious (pre-medicine) VS treating them after they become serious, and 

\- online direct-to-consumer treatment (tele-medicine) VS physical visits to the doctor

The general idea is that preventative care is much cheaper for the overall healthcare system than treatment care, as suggested by the recent shift in regulation to favor Value-Based-Care (VBS) over Fee-For-Service (FFS). And as the pandemic has accelerated the shift to online, tele-medicine will also see more rapid adoption than previously anticipated. 

The merged entity will in general command total market share of the pre-medicine and tele-medicine sector, which means that as the heathcare sector shifts towards these two developments, ""Tela-vongo"" might start to have more bargaining power over existing healthcare players (hospitals and insurance companies), and be able to usurp healthcare market share. 

Anyway you can read his excellent article for the longform business rationale. I'm just going to focus on the financial aspects of the merger, and why I think it makes sense. 

&#x200B;

[Teladoc summarized financials 2015-post acq](https://preview.redd.it/q3qfbkogezf51.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0d400cd95089dd798443a73ef43d1d51c94f29a)

I'm using pre-2020 numbers so as to measure performance on a pre-coronavirus (normalized) basis. As Teladoc has never been profitable pre-2020, I'm using Revenue Growth as the barometer for performance. As we can see, Revenue Growth has generally outpaced Expense Growth, meaning that it has been doing quite alright on the performance front. 

However, Teladoc achieved this growth through making acquisitions rather than organically, i.e. a roll-up strategy. Hence, ROE or ROIC would be a more objective metric to measure performance. However, as Teladoc has never been profitable since listing, I have opted to use RevOE (Revenue on Equity) and RevOIC (Revenue on Invested Capital) as a crude proxy for ROE/ROIC. 

As we can see, RevOE and RevOIC have both hovered around the 20%-30% range for the past 5 years, which at the very least implies that their acquisitions haven't yet been value-destructive. However, immediately post-merger the new entity's RevOE (and RevOIC, assuming all existing debt paid off) will drop to 7%. That means, for the RevOE to return to the pre-merger level of 36%, it will have to grow revenues to $6.576B, or 5x (495%) current post-merger revenues. 

With the business rationale explained by Richard Chu above, I think 5x is feasible over the long-term. And that is before incorporating other bullish assumptions like scale advantages, which should improve ROE at a faster rate than RevOE. Any revenue growth beyond that would imply that the merger is value-accretive. 

Please keep in mind that I have relied entirely on secondary sources for this back-of-the-envelope financial analysis, and have not yet done thorough research. I hope others who have more insight into the merger can contribute more than I have.",26,0.79,1596982821,"[['VS', 2], ['ROIC', 1]]",VS,2.799999952316284,3.1679999828338623
t3_i81riz,Power REIT -- Stock analysis and Value Investors Club application,"This is my Value Investors Club application on Power REIT. Tell me what you think.

Power REIT is a real estate trust with investments in solar, railroad, and newly in medical cannabis greenhouses.

**Thesis**:Power REIT (PW) is the best way to invest in the cannabis area without the traditionally binary hit or miss nature of emerging industries.PW is anchored by a portfolio of traditional properties allowing it to more safely and at lower cost invest in cannabis assets.PW earns a return on invested capital (ROIC) in great excess of the cost of capital. Return of 12%-19% in new properties, recently issued bonds at 4.62%.PW is under valued despite a seemingly rich market price because of probable massive increase in revenue, earnings, and funds from operation (FFO).The margin of safety is significant.

**Significant Assets**:6 Controlled Environment Agriculture greenhouse facilities aggregating over 131,00 square feet7 solar farm ground leases totaling 601 acres112 miles of railroad propertyApprox. $10 mil. cash

**Significant Liabilities**:Approx. $24 mil. Long term debt at interest rates less than or equal to 5%Major debt: $15,500,000 at 4.62% fully amortizing, maturing in 2054Maturities as follows:2021 $635,5022022 $675,3742023 $1,168,2972024 $715,7772025+ $21,208,698Preferred stock: 144,636 shares of 7.75% Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, at $25.

**General info**:Power REIT is currently pursuing investment in what they call controlled environment agriculture or CEA, essentially greenhouses. PW seeks out strictly medical cannabis producers who for whatever reason need additional financing, they then purchase the real estate they own and lease it back to them, and at times help with financing of construction. PW is one of the few ways for cannabis producing companies to get any sort of financing as federally it is still illegal and banks are weary. This gives PW lots of negotiating power in deal making, and that is why they can for example, buy and finance a 5.2 acre CEA property in southern Colorado for around $1 Mil. and get a straight lined rent of $192,000 equating to around a 19% FFO yield.

These properties and tenants are of greater quality than the typical cannabis operation, remember they require tenants to maintain a medical cannabis producers license in the lease. That is a key for PW, this is not a speculative cannabis play that is dependent on federal legalization, on the contrary, a lease they have in a Maine property includes the clause that states that ""After the deferred-rent period, rent is structured to provide a 12.9% return based on the original invested capital amount with annual rent increases of 3% rate per annum. At any time after year six, if cannabis is legalized at the federal level, the rent will be readjusted down to an amount equal to a 9% return on the original invested capital amount and will increase at a 3% rate per annum based on a starting date of the start of year seven."" PW is partly a play against the federal legalization.

**On the topic of debt:**A company with a market cap of under $50 mil with about $24 mil in debt might seem a little risky, but here is where the stability from the solar and rail assets comes in. Their existing FFO from those two asset classes is a little over $1 mil while the debt payments with exception of 2023 don't exceed $1 mil for the foreseeable future. So as long as they don't issue new debt in an uncharacteristically bad way PW will have no solvency issues.

**Management:**Management is skill-full. The CEO David Lesser is pretty much for all intents and purposes the whole company, he is the sole full time employee. He is excellent in terms of real estate expertise. It is very clear he knows his stuff. He has a long history in real estate and more specifically in renewable/clean energy real estate. Lesser is also the chairman of the board, and the largest shareholder. He gets paid exclusively in various forms of equity. His interests are aligned with owners interests. Insider ownership is around 30%, very high for a REIT.

Lesser is also key on avoiding share dilution as stated, and in practice unlike many REITs. There have been no share dilutions besides management's compensation plan. The major recent financing was the 2019 bond issuance.

**Relative Pricing**For this section I will refer to Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) another publicly listed REIT that invests in cannabis assets. IIPR invests in a wider range of assets like retail not just CEA. I am much more suspicious of IIPR's real estate and management. There have been many questions raised about the quality of real estate and solvency of tenants. The CEO seems sleazy and they constantly dilute shareholders. I think PW is superior in terms of intangibles and tangibles. IIPR is PW only publicly traded comparable.

IIPR has grown FFO per share 133% for the MRQ YoY. PW has grown FFO per share 107% over the same time. PW only started investing in high return CEA in late 2019, and engage in more conservative financing, so the difference in growth rates is marginal.

IIPR is currently being priced at around 19.1 times forward 12 months FFO.PW is priced at only 14 times forward 12 months FFO. (If management's most basic expectations are met)In terms of relative price PW, if it sold at the 19.1 multiple it would be selling for $32.4 which I still think could yield an above market rate of return over time.

**Valuation**I believe PW to be the type of business that the market undervalues because of high uncertainty but low risk. The high uncertainty comes from not knowing how much management will want to grow and raise capital, will management continue to use safe amounts of leverage, will new financing options become available to cannabis companies etc. The low risk comes from the fact that PW has very low risk of going to 0 or even decreasing substantially in share price because of the current safety in investment return and diversification. I'll put a floor as to what I think a low risk price is. Let's say base case scenario over the next year PW invests the existing $10 mil. in cash at a yield of 12.5% (below the usual yield of around 18%), doesn't raise any additional capital, and lease payments are collected and debts paid as scheduled. PW FFO per share would be about $0.45 per quarter. If they trade at an P/FFO multiple of 20 (PW currently trades at 27) that makes the price $36 per share. However, I do think capital will be raised, management has expressed interest in doing so. In that case the strong ROIC and high cash flow would give PW a high ceiling to grow as far as macroeconomic and market conditions allow.

## Catalyst

Share price increases when new real estate acquisitions are announced. Eventual dividend. PW currently pays no dividend because the preferred has satisfied the REIT return of capital requirement recently, however with income rising 100%. It is likely a dividend will be coming soon and that will attract more attention. Continued performance and time.

t3_i8moov,Turnaround play: Hostelworld Group (HSW.L),"Hey guys, last month I did a deep-dive into Booking Holdings (BKNG) so for August I wanted to follow this up with another, smaller OTA: Hostelworld Group.

N.B. I have gone long on HSW this past week.

This subreddit is always a goldmine for excellent questions, debate and feedback so any 2-cents given would be fantastic.

# SUMMARY

A lesser known online travel agency (“OTA”) in comparison to my last article on Booking Holdings (**BKNG**), hostel focussed Hostelworld (**HSW**) faces numerous challenges that have resulted in its valuation collapsing from \~£400M in 2018 to \~£70M in August 2020. Their strategy to reinvigorate growth; dividend cuts; and present uncertainty in the travel & tourism sector has investors displeased. Yet, a solid balance sheet ensures their survival of COVID-19; favourable sector tailwinds; and a current valuation pricing their new strategy for failure mean Hostelworld provides an alluring prospect against considerable competitive risks.

# CURRENT PREDICAMENT

**COVID-19**

When assessing Hostelworld’s current woes, let’s mention the elephant in the room first. An updated version of a visualisation shown in my previous article shows tourism is recovering sooner than anticipated. Yet remember, booking volumes are typically [seasonal](https://supercontrol.co.uk/the-bottom-line-on-bookings).

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: YTD \(Jan-Jul\) recovery in online traffic of select accommodation providers. Source: Author, based on data from similarweb.com](https://preview.redd.it/g3ye0rvf4rg51.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=07b2fe86a651910d42ce20ed147f1bcb107f0f9a)

Inevitably, HSW will underperform generalist, large OTAs. Hostels’ typically young, adventurous travellers may prove un-budging, but limited social distancing measures will inhibit a rebound compared to hotels or house-shares. Across 1H 2020, traffic declined 73.16%. Despite the 2H being better, this conservative figure is used in later assumptions.

**BUSINESS WOES / CHANGE IN STRATEGY**

[Figure 2: Recent underperformance of HSW. Source: Author, based on HSW financials.](https://preview.redd.it/lh3xnzom1ng51.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=442999ad3644bef8fa05eaca9713de66b7d64425)

COVID-19 follows a 2018 strategic shake-up, including a complete management overhaul. To shareholders’ disappointment, HSW is yet to reap rewards from its “[roadmap for growth](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/hostelworld-cmd-rns-final-28-11-2018.pdf)” – such initiatives rarely yield instant results. At least we finally understand their direction. Traditionally, OTAs provide a centralised platform, allowing hostel goers and hostel providers access to a fragmented market. HSW aims to expand inorganically into hostel management services.

As management states in their [2019 annual report](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/interactive-annual-report-2019.pdf):

>“Taken together, [Goki](https://goki.travel/) \[who provide automated check-in/locking solutions\] and [Counter](https://counter.app/) \[who provide booking/payment management solutions\] will help Hostelworld re-establish itself not only as an OTA/distributor with hostels, but also as a leading provider of low-cost hostel focussed technology solutions to the hostel industry”.

This strategy appears customer-centric. Hostel providers will appreciate fee reductions and efforts to improve the hostel experience; encouraging preferential listings. This is a good move, yet it does not address low switching costs for hostel goers. Q4 2019 and 2020 were earmarked as the beginning of HSW’s return to growth. Doubtless, this has been significantly derailed. Contrary, COVID-19 may provide an adoption tailwind for Backpack Online (Hostelworld’s management services unit), as hostels look to reduce costs and encourage traveller confidence.

Regardless, the ambiguity of their goals does not fill one with confidence of their execution. The “roadmap for growth” may be a good idea, but until there’s concrete evidence of its opportunity then it remains merely a ‘Call Option’.

**INVESTORS LOSE PATIENCE**

This echoes investors’ frustrations as HSW has sank \~85%, which can be better understood through a historical lens. Hostelworld was controlled by [private equity](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/about-us/company-history) from 2009-2015. An established OTA is an alluring proposition for a PE firm, due to its consistent cash-flows. Hostelworld has [cancelled its dividend](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/hostelworld-cancels-dividend-as-it-counts-coronavirus-cost-1.4212750) policy. Thus, investors valuing HSW for its operating cash flows have left. A lack of top-line growth as well as shareholder remuneration explains a lack of demand for HSW equity.

# FUTURE POSTIVE/NEGATIVE CATALYSTS

**REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL: TAILWINDS**

Despite its origins in early 20th century Germany, hostelling is still an emerging industry. Early hostels were never considered profitable until open-source booking management software and OTAs emerged – incidentally, Hostelworld pioneered both. Now, “[you’re charging 4-star rates and you’re offering a 2-star service, which is what makes it so profitable](https://skift.com/2018/11/12/the-big-money-reinvention-of-the-humble-hostel-a-skift-deep-dive/)”. Hostelling is expected to grow [7-8% annually](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/transactions/targeting-millennials-investors-see-value-hostel-market); much higher than hotelling at [4.6% annually](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/03/08/1750501/0/en/Global-Hotels-Market-Expected-To-Reach-USD-211-54-Billion-By-2025-Zion-Market-Research.html). This growth is attributed to burgeoning travel demand among young, ‘lifestyle’ travellers. Resultantly hoteliers, upstarts and investors have flocked. Hoteliers such as Marriott (**MAR**) and Accor (**AC.EPA**) have expanded their “budget” offerings. Simultaneously hostel chains (unheard of 20 years ago), backed by private equity, have emerged. Hostels now compete with hotels, as the observable differences lessen. Large, generalist OTAs – a la BKNG – benefit most, by offering all options to frugal travellers. Due to their niche, HSW can never compete on scale. Differentiation is therefore the strategy of HSW and operators.

Concerning OTAs specifically, they have enjoyed trends towards online booking methods – [87%](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/the-evolution-of-the-hostel-traveller-v1.pdf) of hostel bookings are now made online. “Will the subsector grow?” is arguably the incorrect question; “will Hostelworld be the primary beneficiary?” better captures concerns of its weakening competitive position.

**REASONS TO BE CAUTIOUS: COMPETITION**

It should be noted HSW is the dominant hostel-focussed OTA, having [acquired](https://www.phocuswire.com/Massive-consolidation-HostelWorld-buys-HostelBookers) main rival HostelBookers in 2013. Despite this, HSW faces competition from many angles: namely large OTAs (BKNG, **EXPE**, etc.) and hostels’ own platforms. As mentioned, OTAs covering multiple accommodation types have an advantage over Hostelworld. When considering [travellers’ preferences when booking](https://www.statista.com/chart/19224/travel-tech-benefits/), large OTAs “gives me more options”. “Saves money” is another top preference, which is best attained when booking direct. Further qualitative insight can be found on this [r/solotravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/go0tsn/do_you_book_toursactivities_with_an_online/) thread. Quantitatively, net bookings (Figure 2) have stagnated. A minor return to bookings growth in [Q4 2019](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/2019-prelims-presentation.pdf) cannot be given much credence, yet arguably an 85% decline in valuation is a tad extreme. Overall, it is difficult to pinpoint what advantage Hostelworld has. Low switching costs are concerning, particularly since many travellers appear to use the platforms to browse but opt to book direct – to support hostels and attain cheaper prices. This train of thought vindicates their redirection.

&#x200B;

[Figure 3: QoQ bookings across HSW platforms. Source: HSW 2019 preliminary presentation.](https://preview.redd.it/1yoyx49f2ng51.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=28396dab2d964e36343beadbf5afeddf0eaa7bd2)

# VALUATION

Analysts identify [competition](https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/914293/hostelworld-falls-out-of-bed-as-it-warns-coronavirus-could-wipe-4mln-off-first-quarter-earnings-914293.html) as a key risk also. Failure to deliver their “roadmap for growth” will cause HSW to further succumb to competitive pressures. In 2020, HSW will comfortably survive, thanks to zero debt and a current ratio of 2.02 on current assets totalling €24M or \~35% of its current valuation ([2019A figures](http://www.hostelworldgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/Hostelworld-v2/reports-and-presentations/interactive-annual-report-2019.pdf)). Beyond is more uncertain.

Revenue assumptions largely drive this DCF valuation. If HSW simply recovers 2019 revenues – based on 2019 P/S ratio – then investors would receive a 16.61% annual return. In a “Bear” scenario, CAGR is 9.41%. A significantly higher valuation could be seen in the “Bull” scenario, driven by higher revenue growth and a possible P/S re-rating.

Regardless of which scenario occurs, HSW trades in a range which aligns with the fundamentals. To minimise risk, HSW is attractive at a 21.45% return below 58 GBp.

To test the robustness of the DCF assumptions a final valuation, a comparison against implied LT and “LT growth rate”, presents a fair value estimate of 56 GBp.

A minnow in the OTA-space, Hostelworld is undoubtedly a business with many challenges and unanswered questions.

Here, a recovery is probable but turnaround of its gradually weakening competitive position is still dubious. Doubling-down on its niche position as a hostel services provider is appropriate but success is also dubious.

t3_i8ticy,Emmis Communications,"Hi, I'm new to this and looking for feedback to improve. I wrote this about two months ago at lower prices, but it hasn't gone up that much. It's a deep value pitch on limited information of business in transition. Whatever feedback you have to help someone new(ish) would be great.

**Summary**

Emmis paid $75 million in March for a mature business, Lencore Acoustics. In addition, Emmis owns $14 million of real estate, gets $8 million annually from Disney, still owns several radio stations in Indianapolis and New York and should collect a $5 million receivable in the next 3 months.

Emmis has an adjusted enterprise value of $19 million.

We don’t have enough information to really value Lencore, but there is enough to know that Lencore probably has positive cash flow material to Emmis. 

Along with the other assets, we have enough information to know there is a very significant disparity between price and value at the moment.

There are some warts too which is why the opportunity exists.

**What is Emmis**

Emmis Communications is a microcap old media company controlled by the CEO that has been selling its media assets for some time. It has disappointed investors hoping it was a liquidation play by using most of the cash to acquire Lencore, a privately-held manufacturer of sound masking machines for offices and privacy sensitive locations. It delisted from a major exchange.

There are a lot of issues: management circle of competence, governance, excessive pay and bloated corporate overhead, delisting and going dark, and how little is known about the acquired business. This is why the opportunity exists.

**History**

Beginning almost 10 years ago, Emmis management started to recognize that traditional broadcast and print assets weren’t that great. But the realization was slow.

The first stage of the transition was to add supposedly complementary businesses that would grow faster than broadcast and print media. Think radio apps. During this stage they also continued to add radio stations (though some print businesses were sold).

That didn’t really work. Next there was a long divestment phase culminating in the spin-off of MediaCo and the sale of the Austin radio stations last year. Note that as a result of these transactions, trailing EPS and revenue are not particularly useful to analyzing current Emmis.

Finally, there was the acquisition of a non-media business, Lencore Acoustics, a few months ago.

Three times in the past 14 years the CEO, Jeff Smulyan, has offered to take the company private, most recently in 2016. Emmis is such a different company now from the most recent attempt in 2016 that I don’t think the valuation of his 2016 offer matters. 

**Lencore**

Emmis acquired Lencore Acoustics for $75 million in March. Lencore also owned an mass notification SMS business that was not acquired. The SMS business seems to have been a small part of Lencore overall.

Lencore sells sound masking solutions to government and enterprise customers. These systems are more sophisticated than they sound. The individual appliances are networked and can be controlled centrally. They work together and are tuned to make spaces quieter to the human ear.

We don’t know more than we know about this business. Lencore was privately held and Emmis has released barely any financial information about it: just the working capital that was acquired in the deal. We have some information on what Emmis was looking for during its search. We also know something about Lencore’s clients. We know how it does relative to competitors in federal contracting. We know a few other details. All of these things point to a mature, stable business with cash flow that’s material to Emmis’s valuation.

You can’t value Lencore with this information. But Emmis doesn’t have to go into the too hard bucket as long as we can conclude Lencore is probably worth a significant fraction of its purchase price.

Let’s start with what Emmis was looking for while it was shopping for a business to buy.

Jeff Smulyan was asked on the July 2019 earnings call what he was looking for in terms of an acquisition:

Q: Are there any parameters for target businesses that you can share?

A: Well, I think, certainly I think it's size. I think businesses with probably $10 million to $25 million of cash flow. That would be probably the target size. Again that's -- I think we don't want startups. I think we've seen a lot of startups, we've done some startups, but I think we would really like to find businesses that are up and running that are mature where we think we see something that might make them a little bit better.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-emms-earnings-conference-173628404.html

Emmis disclosed that the $75.1 million purchase price included $5.3 million of working capital. If Lencore had 90 days of working capital, that would mean $22 million of sales. 45 days would be $42 million of sales.

Emmis’s business development VP publicly posted on LinkedIn during the search that Emmis was seeking businesses with 25% margins. 25% is as good a number to use as any for an exercise this imprecise. That gets us to an EBITDA range of $5.5 to $10.5 million, or an EV/EBITDA range for the sale price of roughly 7 to 13. This looks a bit expensive but not implausible for a mature business.

In other words, Emmis overpaying somewhat for Lencore is baked into the analysis.

We have a few other data points as well. It is not a lot but still something. 

Lencore has been in the sound masking business since 1990. It has survived several business cycles and has 33 employees. It lists 20+ Fortune 500 companies, 20+ large healthcare systems and 20+ federal government clients on its website.

Federal contract data shows sales on par with competitor Cambridge Sound and above other competitors. While the actual sales numbers to the federal government are not material, it is evidence of how Lencore performs in its industry.

It is hiring sales staff. (Relevant because of COVID-19)

This is not enough to properly value Lencore. We do not have financials, we cannot know maintenance capex, growth rates, etc.

But I do think it is enough to say that Lencore is likely worth something material relative to Emmis’s current enterprise value.

**Enterprise Value Adjustments**

Let’s look at the enterprise value first. As I said, this requires some adjustments from the most recent quarter.

First, since we know Emmis spent $75.1 million in cash on Lencore and $3.1 million on transaction fees, we should subtract that from the MRQ cash. This moves that cash on the balance sheet to $14.8 million from $93 million. 

Long term debt and operating leases are $65.5 million on the balance sheet. $44.1 million of this is non-recourse to Emmis and its subsidiaries. Therefore, adjusted debt is $21.4 million. 

Emmis’s financials consolidate an ESPN radio station in NYC that Disney operates and finances. The debt is Disney’s economically, and there is also $1 million of restricted cash on the asset side that is Disney’s economically which I have excluded from Emmis’s cash. There is also a smaller amount of non-recourse debt related to the failed Digonex entity that I exclude.

One final adjustment is that Emmis deposited $8 million in cash as collateral with the mortgage lender that lent against the headquarters. This was done to allow Emmis to divest some of its assets that were otherwise securing the mortgage and also to reduce the interest rate on the mortgage.

The cash collateral is on the balance sheet as a non-current asset. It’s reasonable to offset the cash collateral with the mortgage itself to establish net debt. This brings the adjusted debt to $13.4 million. Note that the cash collateral is not cash on the balance sheet, so this is not double-counted.

Emmis’s current market cap is $20.8 million, so my EV after adjustments is $19.4 million. (20.8+13.4-14.8)

Non-Lencore Assets & Corporate Overhead

In addition to Lencore, the company has a variety of assets:

* Headquarters building: assessed at $15.4 million. Applying a 20% discount: $12.3 million
* 70 acres in an Indianapolis suburb: using comparable sales, estimated $2.1 million. Discount 30% to $1.5m
* Disney contract that pays $8.3 million/year through 2024. NPV with a 3% discount rate: $31.8 million
* $6.5 million MediaCo receivable guaranteed for $5 million by Standard General, due in August: $5 million
* Residual value of the NY FM station after Disney lease expires in 2024. I halved the Disney payment and applied a 5 multiple and then discounted to the present. $17 million. This probably underestimates the value since Disney will want to renew the contract or else its NYC listeners will have to find ESPN on the dial somewhere else.
* NY AM station. Book value after impairment is $6.6 million. Even though WABC was recently sold for $12.5 million, I am going to cut the book value in half to $3.3 million.
* Indianapolis stations. Some FM stations in markets smaller than Indianapolis have sold during COVID-19 for $750,000. Valuing each Indianapolis station at this price, I get $3.75 million. Book value is $15 million after impairment for comparison.
* MediaCo convertible note: $0. MediaCo is over-levered and probably insolvent. However, there is upside here if Standard General is willing to put in more money to save MediaCo from the senior lenders.
* MediaCo management fee: $0.
* Magazine business: $0

I get a total value for other assets of $75.25 million even with some conservative or even draconian assumptions. At this EV, it doesn’t have to be spot on. What is important is whether these assets, conservatively valued, provide an ample margin of safety and reward on the current EV. I am least confident in my value for the radio stations, but there is still a significant margin of safety even if they are worth nothing.

Any valuation would be unrealistic of course without factoring in the $18 million spent last year in corporate overhead. This is very high for a company of this size. On the plus side, this should decline due to the delisting and two arguably one-off items.

Delisting should save $1-2 million per year. The supposedly one-off items are $0.8 of fees related to the Lencore transaction and $6 million of additional executive bonuses for completing the divestment strategy. 

I am skeptical about the bonuses being exceptional. However, these adjustments bring corporate expense to $10-11 million, which was the previous fiscal year’s number and still high for a company this size. It seems reasonable to believe the company can get back to the $10-11 million level.

**Management**

Management and the board own 22% of the company. Jeff Smulyan controls the company through a special share class. They could choose to loot the company into oblivion. That, combined with the negative story on radio, forced selling from delisting, and COVID-19’s effect on advertising is why the stock is cheap.

My biggest worry in researching Emmis was whether management just blew up $75 million. My second biggest worry was that they would continue to do things like that. 

But after looking at their capital allocation record, I think they have been about average and not terrible. Certainly management has made capital allocation mistakes in the past ten years, especially trying to be venture capitalists and incubators for radio-related technologies.

But some credit is due for getting out of the print and radio business at decent valuations and using the proceeds to delever. For instance, MediaCo’s assets do not look like they are worth the $90 million Emmis got paid for them. Some credit is also due for pulling the plug on the startups and ceasing that strategy altogether. A lot of capital is destroyed by sheer stubbornness and they didn't make that mistake forever.

So, management got some decisions right: get out of the media and print business and get the debt off the balance sheet. 

**Valuation**

In my base case, Lencore was not stupid, and things will work out for shareholders buying in at this level even without additional catalysts like asset sales or closing the remaining loss making businesses (though obviously that would help). The corporate overhead declines to $12 million/year, Lencore adds $7 million EBIT in 2021, Emmis collects the $5 million owed by MediaCo and gets 1 year of the management fee for another $1.5 million. In this scenario, Emmis will burn a small amount of cash and have net assets (less non-recourse debt) of more than $60 million. An EV of half net assets does not seem like a big hurdle and that implies adding $17 million to the current market capitalization of $20.8 million.

In the modest bull case where some of the non-Lencore assets are sold for post COVID prices and corporate expenses decline from imperial to merely decadent, Emmis is a multibagger. How much? I can’t say, but 2, 3, 4x are possible depending on the degree of cost savings and asset sales. 

For example, if expense at the corporate level returns to $10 million/year, one of the major assets is sold (headquarters or the NY FM station) and Lencore earns $7 million, Emmis would have $3 million in EBIT and perhaps have $20 or 30 million in net cash. In this case, valuing the cash at face value and the rest of the non-Lencore assets at half face value, we get $60 million. That is a triple in the equity from the current EV.

The downside is limited given that debt is less than cash, the hard assets on the balance sheet relative to the enterprise value, and a controlling shareholder and CEO who has shown a willingness and the means to take the company private. 

The bear case is some combination of Lencore turning out to not be worth much and continued very high corporate overhead. It is possible that this turns out to be a value trap. 

However, this idea does have time to realize value. Even at last year’s cash burn (ie, the scenario where Lencore generates no cash and expenses remain extremely high), there are over 4 years before the non-Lencore assets net of debt would be diminished beyond the current market cap.

The margin of safety provided by assets plus Lencore should be sufficient for this to work out in the next few years, especially with multiple potential catalysts: a management led buyout, additional disclosure about Lencore, sales of some of the remaining assets, or even a re-listing on a major exchange. 

One final note about COVID-19 risk: I know that the world is different than when it was when the deal closed, but I am comforted that Lencore is still hiring sales staff. Combined with our margin of safety, I don’t think COVID-19 is a significant risk to the thesis.",14,0.79,1597293547,"[['NYC', 2], ['NPV', 1], ['WABC', 1]]",NYC,15.5,14.949999809265137
t3_i9cqqt,Quick Take on Xeris Pharma (XERS),"Disclaimer: I am LONG equity. Please do due diligence. This is based off of 60 minutes of quick analysis.

**Company Overview**

Xeris is a spec pharma company founded in 2005. Their primary scope of work involves developed injectable and infusible drugs.

**2019-Present: Product Launch**

Their first product was approved in September 2019, called Gvoke. It is a PFS and auto-injector that has glucagon, to treat severe hypoglycemia. This is market as two different products: Gvoke PFS (Nov 2019) and Gvoke HypoPen (July 2020).

&#x200B;

[Gvoke Hypopen](https://preview.redd.it/1e9osz3sjvg51.jpg?width=648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a6216df6c5000cf4f981c5b18bafa9ae0e1ad60)

**Competition**

Primary competition comes from tradition glucagon kits and Eli Lilly’s BAQSIMI.

BAQSIMI is delivered via the Nasal passage. Legacy kits are traditional syringe injections. Xeris has the advantage with both a PFS and auto-injector, which traditionally are well received with patients.

&#x200B;

[BAQSIMI](https://preview.redd.it/2i1zurqijvg51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84fa07d3396c6836344e2a74a09cf76eba96b0f9)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financials**

The most popular product will most likely be the two-pack hypopen (auto-injector). This carries an AWP of $673.92. For adults, the prescription is 1mg/0.2mL. (BAQSIMI cost is similar with 3 mg dosage, and legacy kits from LLY cost \~$280/kit)

&#x200B;

[Gvoke Micromedex](https://preview.redd.it/nbe7tnaljvg51.jpg?width=717&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85337a91e43f0d7306df87c3fb1a9b7742f0ea16)

&#x200B;

One overhang with Xeris’ financials is their long-term debt, which has increased from $58.3M YE19 to $109.5M 2Q20. However, principal payments do not start until 2022, and interest expenses should be below $10M for the year. Xeris should be generating enough FCF over the next two years to service their debt.

**Valuation Takeaways**

· Peak sales of \~$250M

· WACC @ 11%

· Positive EBITDA by 2026

t3_idjqw7,Agora $API Write-Up: Hypergrowth Chinese Twilio,"A simple way to describe Agora is it’s like a Chinese Twilio focused on video, and more specifically live streaming (which Twilio does not do). Although many are understandably hesitant about Chinese companies, my confidence is a bit higher in this one given founder and CEO Tony Zhao’s history of working in the US (he was a founding engineer at WebEx), that Agora has dual headquarters in China and the US and only expanded to China a year after it was founded, their impressive customer list with giants like Xiaomi and ByteDance, and some famous investors like Coatue that reportedly decided to invest after just two weeks.

I’ve written a deep dive on it on my Substack where I provide an overview of its platform, customers, competition, market opportunity, financials, and risks. I'm long Agora in my personal portfolio and it's a company I'm really excited about as it has most of the criteria I look for in a potential multi-bagger: hypergrowth, category leader with a defensible moat, large and fast-growing TAM with high optionality, small market cap (under $5B), strong margins, and visionary management (Tony pioneered Real-Time Engagement).

My Agora thesis also ties in with the future I see for Twilio and Zoom, and I go over it in the market opportunity section. Namely, I believe we will see the gradual commoditization of video which will lead to the unbundling of Zoom. Here’s a nice quote by JJ Oslund, whose article I reference: “Companies like Zoom that achieve massive growth and ubiquity lose one important competitive advantage: the ability to focus on a particular user… Zoom has become the lowest common denominator that works for everyone, yet it is not perfectly suited for anyone.”

ZM has already made significant inroads into education and telehealth but there is significant opportunity to chip away at their moat by focusing on serving specific user needs. The real competition isn’t WebEx, Meet, etc, it's the 250+ companies carving out their own verticals. “The endpoint for the verticalization of Zoom will be a no-code tool that gives users the power to design highly custom video apps for their particular needs.” And that's exactly what Agora is building.

The other part of my thesis, which may be of interest to Twilio owners, is that I believe some revolutionary businesses will be ideated in the current environment. Some of the greatest innovations came during periods of the greatest turmoil and with the advent of the API economy, companies like Twilio and Agora are well-positioned to help the new wave of start-ups, such as the ones that are competing against Zoom, scale up fast. In my opinion, the most exciting vertical for Twilio is healthcare. They became HIPAA compliant in February, and they've since seen more than a 100 percent increase in active healthcare customers using its video product. I think as traditional healthcare systems digitize then TWLO can do really well here even though this vertical is non-material to their growth right now. This plays into my TDOC thesis that I’ve outlined in previous blog posts.

t3_ieoouu,Long Thesis - 10x Genomics (TXG) - Towards a comprehensive view of biology,"**Intro:**

I would like to start sharing my long thesis on biotech companies, genomics in particular, from the perspective of someone that works in the field.  A little about myself - I have a B.S. in Bioengineering and M.S. in Bioinformatics and work as a Computational Biologist in academic oncology research.  I do not and have not worked for 10x Genomics.  I'm an amateur when it comes to security analysis and am approaching investing by capitalizing on trends I see in my own field of work and having worked directly or indirectly with the technologies in question.  I hope my unique insights may be beneficial and look forward to learning from others.  

**What do they do and why does it matter:**

10x Genomics provides technology to sequence DNA in individual cells as opposed to sequencing DNA from a bulk sample.  Standard practice involves collecting a tissue sample, mashing it up, and sequencing the extracted DNA as a whole.  Now imagine collecting that same tissue sample, separating out each individual cell, and sequencing the DNA from each cell.  This then provides the researcher a with a window into the cellular micro-environment.  Essentially aiding in answering the question of what cell type is doing what and where.  This kind of information in invaluable and could lead to the development of novel therapeutics and new avenues of inquiry. 

The initial product offered by TXG is their ""Chromium System"" that allows for the single cell sequencing mentioned above.  The most recent product is their ""Visium Technology"" which, in addition to the information described above, provides spatial data on the cellular environment.  This means that not only can you obtain information about what's going on in each cell, you can obtain information about WHERE it is happening.

**Financial case for TXG and notes from Q2 call:**

In an attempt to become a better financial analyst I've studied many of the investor materials on the 10x Genomics website.  This includes listening to the most recent Q2 conference call, reviewing uploaded presentations, and studying SEC filings.  From the financial point of view yearly revenues continue to increase and I expect the company to become profitable as early as 2021.  Debt levels appear to be reasonable and decreasing.  The main revenue streams are instrument sales and consumables in the form of reagents required to run the machines.

Notes I considered important from Q2 call:

\- Continue to see strong demand for TXG products despite covid pandemic

\- 60% of labs using TXG technology returned to operation through the summer post covid shutdown

\- Potential for NIH (National Institute of Health) to increase funding for research in general due to covid which could boost demand for TXG technology

\- Increase in patent filings and approval

**Competition:**

Given my unique perspective ""single cell sequencing"" and ""10x Genomics"" are practically synonymous in the field and many researchers aren't even aware of competition to TXG.  With that being said, Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) offers a competing but inferior product (I've never seen anyone actually use it personally or in a publication).  Additionally, Becton Dickinson (BDX) offers similar technology which I don't hear much about.  However, TXG's CEO Serge Saxonov complemented BDX's single cell sequencing technology at the [UBS Genomics 2.0 and Medtech Innovations Virtual Summit](https://investors.10xgenomics.com/events/event-details/ubs-genomics-20-and-medtech-innovations-virtual-summit).

**Final case:**

My case is built upon my perspective in the field and I see that single cell sequencing is booming which is backed up by the 1200+ peer reviewed publications since 2016 that use TXG technology.  This number is increasing yearly and I see the trend accelerating especially with the new Visium technology.  TXG technology is increasingly used in industry for therapeutic development as well is in academia for research.  Having worked with data produced by TXG technology and having insight into how their customers view the product I see TXG continuing growth for the next several years at least.

Again, I want to point out that my case relies upon being familiar with trends in research and the product.  The financial analysis is amateur and secondary (would love feedback on anything I missed in the financials of the company itself).

For employers, Progyny reduces costs by including the latest cutting-edge technology in one packaged price, thereby lowering the risk of multiples and increasing the likelihood of pregnancy, keeping employees happy with an integrated, data-driven, concierge service partnering with a selective group of fertility doctors. 

Upside potential is 2x current price in the next 18 months. 

**Overview**

Progyny Inc. (Nasdaq: PGNY), “PGNY” or the “Company”, based in New York, NY, is the leading independent fertility and family building benefits manager. Progyny serves as a value-add benefits manager sold to employers who want to improve their benefits coverage and retain and attract the best employees. Progyny offers a comprehensive solution and is truly disrupting the fertility industry.

There is no standard fertility cycle, but the below is a good approximation of possible workflows:

1. Patient is referred to fertility center for evaluation for Assisted Reproductive Technology (“ART”) procedures, including in-vitro fertilization (“IVF “) and intrauterine insemination (“IUI”). Both can be aided by pharmaceuticals that stimulate egg production in the female patient. IVF involves the fertilization of the egg and sperm in the lab, while IUI is direct injection of the sperm sample into the uterus. Often, IUI is done first as it is less expensive. As success rates of IVF have increased, IUI utilization will likely fall.

2. Sperm washing is the separation of the sperm from the semen sample for embryo creation, and it enhances the freezing capacity of the sperm. Typically, a wash solution is added to the sample and then a centrifuge is used to undergo separation. This is done in both IUI and IVF.

3. Some OB/GYN platforms are pursuing vertical integration and offering fertility services directly. The OB would need to be credentialed at the lab / procedure center. 

4. Specialty pharmacy arranges delivery of temperature sensitive Rx. Drug regimens include ovarian stimulation to increase the number of eggs or hormone manipulation to better time fertility cycles, among others.

5. Oocyte retrieval / aspiration is done under deep-sedation anesthesia in a procedure room, typically in the attached IVF lab. Transfer cycle implantation is done using ultrasound guidance without anesthesia. (Anecdotally, we have been told that only REIs can perform an egg retrieval. We have not been able to validate this).

6. Many clinics house frozen embryos on-site, while some clinics contract with 3rd parties to manage the process. During an IVF cycle, embryos are created from all available eggs. Single-embryo transfer (“SET”) is becoming the norm, which means that multiple embryos are then cryopreserved to use in the future. A fertility preservation cycle ends here with a female storing eggs for long-term usage (e.g. a woman in her young 20s deciding to freeze her eggs for starting a family later).

7. Common nomenclature refers to an IVF cycle or an IVF cycle with Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (“ICSI”). From a technical perspective, ICSI and IVF are different forms of embryo fertilization within an ART cycle.

8. ART clinics are frequently offering ancillary services such as embryo / egg adoption or surrogacy services. More frequently, there are independent companies that help with the adoption process and finding surrogates.

9. ART procedures are broken into two different types of cycles: a banking cycle is the process by which eggs are gathered, embryos are created and then transferred to cryopreservation. A transfer cycle is typically the transfer of a thawed embryo to the female for potential pregnancy. If a pregnancy does not occur, another transfer cycle ensues. Many REIs are moving towards a banking cycle, freezing all embryos, then transfer cycles until embryos are exhausted or a birth occurs. If a birth occurs with the first embryo, patients can keep their embryos for future pregnancy attempts, donate the embryos to a donation center, or request the destruction of the embryos. 

The Company started as Auxogen Biosciences, an egg-freezing provider before changing business models to focus on providing a full-range of fertility benefits. In 2016, they launched with their first 5 employer clients and 110,000 members. As of June 30, 2020, the Company provided benefits to 134 employers and \~2.2 million members, year over year growth of 63%. 134 employers is less than 2% of the total addressable market of “approximately 8,000 self-insured employers in the United States (excluding quasi-governmental entities, such as universities and school systems, and labor unions) who have a minimum of 1,000 employees and represent approximately 69 million potential covered lives in total. Our current member base of 2.1 million represents only 3% of our total market opportunity.”

The utilization rate for all Progyny members was less than 1% in 2019, offering significant leverageable upside as the topic of fertility becomes less taboo.

Fertility has historically been a process fraught one-sided knowledge, even more so than the typical physician procedure. Despite the increased availability of information on the internet, women who undergo fertility treatments have often described the experience as “byzantine” and “chaotic”. Outdated treatment models without the latest technology (or the latest tech offered as expensive a la carte options) continue to be the norm at traditional insurance providers as well as clinics that do not accept insurance. Progyny’s differentiated approach, including a high-touch concierge level of service for patients and data-driven decision making at the clinical level, has led to an NPS of 72 for fertility benefits and 80 for the integrated, optional pharmacy benefit. 

Typically, fertility benefits offered by large insurance carriers are add-ons to existing coverage subject to a lifetime maximum while simultaneously requiring physicians to try IUI 3 – 6 times before authorizing IVF. The success rate of IUI, also known as artificial insemination, is typically less than 10%, even when performed with medication. As mentioned in Progyny’s IPO “A patient with mandated fertility step therapy protocol may be required to undergo three to six cycles of IUI, which has an average success rate range of 5% to 15%, takes place over three to six months and can cost up to $4,000 per cycle (or an aggregate of approximately $12,000 to $24,000), according to FertilityIQ. Multiple rounds of mandated IUI is likely to exhaust the patient's lifetime dollar maximum fertility benefits and waste valuable time before more effective IVF treatment can be begun.” 

**Success Rates for IVF** 

IVF success rates vary greatly by age but were 49% on average for women younger than 35. The graph below shows success rates by all clinics by age group for those that did at least 10 cycles in the specific age group. As an example, for those in the ages 35 – 37, out of 456 available clinics, 425 performed at least 10 cycles with a median success rate of 39.7%.

Progyny’s Smart Cycle is the proprietary method the company has chosen as a “currency” for fertility benefits. As opposed to a traditional fee-for-service model with step-up methods, employers may choose to provide between 2 and unlimited Smart Cycles to employees. This enables employees to choose the provider’s best method. Included in the Smart Cycle, and another indicator of the Company’s forward-thinking methodology, are treatment options that deliver better outcomes (PGS, ICSI, multiple embryo freezing with future implantations). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/np577a389zi51.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=c061a2b24c8515890ba204479b4677893dabf755

As detailed in the chart above, a patient could undergo an IVF cycle that freezes all embryos (3/4 of a Smart Cycle), then transfer 5 frozen embryos (1/4 cycle each; each transfer would occur at peak ovulation, which would take at least 5 months) and use only 2 Smart Cycles. Alternatively, if the patient froze all embryos and got pregnant on the first embryo transfer, they would only use one cycle. 

Before advances in vitrification (freezing), patients could not be sure that an embryo created in the lab and frozen for later use would be viable, so using only one embryo at a time seemed wasteful. Now, as freezing technology has advanced, undergoing one pharmaceutical regime, one oocyte collection procedure, creating as many embryos as possible, and then transferring one embryo back into the uterus while freezing the rest provides the highest ROI. If the first transferred embryo fails to implant or otherwise does not lead to a baby, the patient can simply thaw the next embryo and try implantation again next month. 

Included in each Smart Cycle is pre-implantation genetic sequencing (“PGS”) on all available embryos and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (“ICSI”). PGS uses next-generation sequencing technology to determine the viability and sex of the embryo while ICSI is a process whereby a sperm is directly inserted into the egg to start fertilization, rather than allowing the sperm to penetrate the egg naturally. ICSI has a slightly higher rate of successful fertilization (as opposed to simply leaving the egg and sperm in the petri dish). 

Because Progyny’s experience is denominated in cycles of care, not simply dollars, patients and doctors can focus on what procedures offer the best return. 30% of the Company’s existing network of doctors do not accept insurance of any kind, other than Progyny, which speaks to the value that is provided to doctors and employers.

For patients not looking to get pregnant, Progyny offers egg freezing as well. Progyny started as an egg-freezing manager, which allows a woman to preserve her fertility and manage her biological clock. As mentioned previously, pregnancy outcomes vary significantly and align closely with the age of the egg. Egg freezing is designed to allow a woman to save her younger eggs until she is ready to start a family. From an employer’s perspective, keeping younger women in the work force for longer is a cost savings. Vitrification technology has improved significantly since “Freeze your eggs, Free Your Career” was the headline on Bloomberg Businesweek in 2014, but we still don’t yet know the pregnancy rates for women who froze their eggs 5 years ago, but early results are promising and on par with IVF rates for women of similar ages now. 

From a female perspective, the egg freezing process is not an easy one. The patient is still required to inject themselves with stimulation drugs and the egg retrieval process is the same as in the IVF process (under sedation). The same number of days out of work are required. Using the SmartCycle benefit above as an example, the egg freezing process would require ½ of a Smart Cycle. The annual payment required to the clinic is typically included in the benefits package but may require out-of-pocket expenses covered by the employee. 

Contrary to popular belief, IVF pregnancies do not have a higher rate of multiples (twins, triplets, etc.), rather in order to reduce out of pocket costs, REIs have transferred multiple embryos to the patient, in the hopes of achieving a pregnancy. If you have struggled for years to get pregnant, and the doctor is suggesting that transferring 3 embryos at once is your best chance at success, you are unlikely to complain, nor are you likely to selectively eliminate an implanted embryo because you now have twins. There are several factors that are making it more likely / acceptable to transfer one embryo at a time, enabling Progyny’s success.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/48vk9gc69zi51.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c75a2771a1dd9a079074331b317451f076725ca

From the Company: “According to a study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology that analyzed the total costs of care over 400,000 deliveries between 2005 and 2010, as adjusted for inflation, the maternity and perinatal healthcare costs attributable to a set of twins are approximately $150,000 on average, more than four times the comparable costs attributable to singleton births of approximately $35,000, and often exceed this average. In the case of triplets, the costs escalate significantly and average $560,000, sometimes extending upwards of $1.0 million.”

“Progyny's selective network of high-quality fertility specialists consistently demonstrate a strong adherence to best practices with a substantially higher single embryo transfer rate. As a result, our members experience significantly fewer pregnancies with multiples (e.g., twins or triplets). Multiples are associated with a higher probability of adverse medical conditions for the mother and babies, and as a byproduct, significantly escalate the costs for employers. Our IVF multiples rate is 3.6% compared to the national average of 16.1%. A lower multiples rate is the primary means to achieving lower high-risk maternity and NICU expenses for our clients.” 

An educated and supported patient leads to better outcomes. Each patient gets a patient care advocate who interacts with a patient, on average, 15x during their usage of fertility benefits - before treatment, during treatment and post-pregnancy. The Company provides phone-based clinical education and support seven days a week and the Company’s proprietary “UnPack It” call allows patients to speak to a licensed pharmacy clinician who describes the medications included in the package (which contains an average of 20 items per cycle), provides instruction on proper medication administration, and ensures that cycles start on time. The Company’s single medication authorization and delivery led to no missed or delayed cycles in 2018.

Previous conference calls have made note of the fact that the Company would like to purchase their own specialty pharmacy and own every aspect of that interaction, which should provide a lift to gross margins. This would allow PGNY to manage both the medication and the treatment, leading to decreased cost of fertility drugs. Under larger carrier programs, carriers manage access to treatment, but PBM manages access to medications, which can lead to a delay in cycle commencement. 

Progyny Rx can only be added to the Progyny fertility benefits solution (not offered without subscription to base fertility benefits) and offers patients a potentially lower cost fertility drug benefit, while streamlining what is often a frustrating part of the consumer experience. The Progyny Rx solution reduces dispensing and delivery times and eliminates the possibility that a cycle does not start on time due to a specialty pharmacy not delivering medication. Progyny bills employers for fertility medication as it is dispensed in accordance with the individual Smart Cycle contract. Progyny Rx was introduced in 2018 and represented only 5% of total revenue in 2018. By June 30, 2020, Progyny Rx represented 28% of total revenue and increased 15% y/y. The growth rate should slow and move more in line with the fertility benefits solution as the existing customer base adds it to their package. 

Progyny Rx can save employers 5% on spend for typical carrier fertility benefits or 21% of the drug spend. Prior authorization is not required, and the pre-screened network of specialty pharmacies can deliver within 48 hours. Additionally, PGNY has 1-year contracts, as opposed to 3 – 5 years like standard PBMs, but with guaranteed minimums, allowing them to purchase at discounts and pass part of the savings on to employers – another reason the attachment rate is so high. 

**Large, Underpenetrated Addressable Market**

Total cycle counts are increasing (below, in 000s), including both freezing cycles and intended-pregnancy cycles. Acceleration in cycle volume is likely driven by a declining birth rate as women wait later in life to start a family, resulting in reduced fertility, as well as the number of non-traditional (LGBT and single parents). Conservatively, we believe cycles can double in the next 8 years, a 7% CAGR. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6y7jb559zi51.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cc5cdde7c6583d8e943d2675ad3b6ae85f818de

Progyny believes its addressable market is the $6.7B spent on infertility treatments in 2017, but these numbers could easily understate the available market and potential patients as over 50% of people in the US who are diagnosed as infertile do not seek treatment. Additionally, according to the Company, 35% of its covered universe did not previously have fertility benefits in place previously, meaning there is a growing population of people who are now considering their fertility options. According to Willis Towers, Watson, \~ 55% of employers offered fertility benefits in 2018. 

A quick review of CDC stats and FertilityIQ shows a significant disparity in outcomes and emotions for those who are seeking treatment. While technology in the embryo lab is improving rapidly and success rates between clinics should be converging, there continue to be significant outliers. Clinics that follow what are now generally accepted procedures (follicle stimulating hormones, a 5-day incubation period and PGS to determine embryo viability) have seen success rates of at least 40%. There continue to be several providers that offer a mini-IVF cycle or natural IVF cycle. Designed to appeal to cost conscious cash payors, the on average $5,000 costs, is simply IVF without prescription drugs or any add-ons such as PGS. However, the success rates are on par with IUI and there is an abundance of patients over 40 using the service, where the success rates are already low. Additionally, success stories at these clinics frequently align with what is perceived as the worst parts of the process:

One clinic offering a natural cycle IVF has a rating at FertilityIQ of \~8.0 with 60% of people strongly recommending it. This clinic performed 2,000 cycles in 2018 (the most recently available data from the CDC), making it one of the top 10 most active fertility center in the US. Their success rate for women under 35 was 23%, as opposed to the national average of 50% for all clinics. For women over 43, the average success rate for the most active 40 clinics in this demographic was 5.0% this clinics success rate was 0.4%. The lower success rate is likely due to the lack of pre-cycle drugs and PGS, but the success rate and the average rating is hard to understand. Part of this could be to the customer service provided by the clinic, or the perceived benefit of having to go into the office less often for check-ups when not doing a medication driven cycle. 

. 

Reviews from other clinics with high average customer ratings, but low success rates include:

\- “start of a journey that consisted of multiple IUI’s with numerous medications, but they were not successful.” 

\- After an IVF retrieval, the couple had two viable embryos, both were transferred the next month”

\- “The couple started with a series of IUI treatments, three in total that were not successful.” 

\- “After a fresh transfer of two embryos, again another unsuccessful cycle”.

\- “He suggested transferring 2 due to higher implantation rates, but there is increased rate of twins “

Progyny’s comps have typically been other high-growth companies that went public in the last two years: 1Life Healthcare (ONEM), Accolade (ACCD), Health Catalyst (HCAT), Health Equity (HQY), Livongo (LVGO), Phreesia (PHR), as well as Teladoc (TDOC). Despite revenue growth that outpaces these companies, PGNY’s revenue multiple of 4.4x 2021E revenue is a 40% discount to the peer group median. PNGY’s lower gross margin is likely limiting the multiple. However, Progyny is the one of the few profitable companies in this group and the only one with realistic EBTIDA margins. SG&A leverage is the most likely driver of increased EBITDA and can be achieved by utilizing data to improve clinical outcomes in the future, but primarily by increased productive of the sales reps, including larger employer wins and larger employee utilization.

Perhaps the best direct comp is Bright Horizons (BFAM). BFAM offers childcare as a healthcare benefit where employees can use pre-tax dollars to pay for childcare. BFAM offers both onsite childcare centers built to the employer’s specification (owned by the employer and operated by BFAM), as well as shared-site locations that are open to the public and back-up sitter services. Currently, PGNY is trading at 4.4x 2021E Revenue, in-line with BFAM’s 4.3x multiple. I would argue that PGNY should trade significantly higher given the asset-lite business model and higher ROIC. 

**Recent Results**

Post Covid-19, fertility treatments came back faster than anticipated, combined with disciplined operations, PGNY drove revenue and EBITDA above 2Q2020 consensus estimates. Utilization is still below historical levels, but management’s visibility led to excellent FY21 revenue estimates (consensus is around $555M, a y/y increase of 62%. 

2Q2020 revenue increased 15% to $64.6M, and EBITDA increased 18% to $6.5M, primarily driven by SBC as the 15% revenue was not enough to leverage the additional G&A people hired in the last 18 months. The end of the quarter as fertility docs opened their offices back up for remote visits saw better operating margin. 

Despite the shutdown in fertility clinics during COVID-19, Progyny was able to successfully add several clients. 

“The significant majority of the clinics in our network chose to adhere to ASRMs guidelines, and our volume of fertility treatments and dispensing of the related medications declined significantly over the latter part of the quarter. . . Through the end of March and into the first half of April, we saw significant reductions in the utilization of the benefit by our members down to as low as 15%, when compared to the early part of Q1 were 15% of what we consider to be normal levels. In April, the New York Department of Health declared that fertility is an essential health service and stated that clinics have the authority to treat their patients and perform procedures during the pandemic. Then on April 24, ASRM updated its guidelines which were reaffirmed on May 11, advising that practices could reopen for all procedures so long as it could be done in a measured way that is safe for patients and staff.”

Revenue increased by $33.8 million, 72% in 1Q2020. This increase is primarily due to a $19.0 million, or 47% increase, in revenue from fertility benefits. Additionally, the Company experienced a $14.8 million or 216% increase in revenue from specialty pharmacy. Revenue growth was due to the increase in the number of clients and covered lives. Progyny Rx revenue growth outpaced the fertility benefits revenue since Progyny Rx went live with only a select number of clients on January 1, 2018 and has continued to add both new and existing fertility benefit solution clients since its initial launch. 

**Competition**

The only true competition is the large insurance companies, but, as mentioned previously, they are not delivering care the same way.  WINFertility is the largest manager of fertility insurance benefits on behalf of Anthem, Aetna and Cigna and are not directly involved in the delivery of care. Carrot is a Silicon Valley startup that recently raised $24M in a Series B with several brand name customers (StitchFix, Slack) where they focus on negotiating discounts at fertility clinics for their customers, who then use after-tax dollars from their employers. 

**Risks to Thesis**

Though there is risk a large carrier may switch to a model similar to Progyny’s, I believe it is unlikely given the established relationships with REIs at the clinic level, the difficulty of managing a more selective network of providers, and the lack of 

interest shown previously in eliminating the IUI. It is more likely a carrier would acquire Progyny first.",110,0.96,1598288045,"[['PGNY', 5], ['BFAM', 2], ['B', 1]]",PGNY,28.09600067138672,29.950000762939453

t3_ii5c3s,Question about Graham Number considering MFGP and AMD,"Hi all,

I am **very** new to security analysis and just came across Graham Number which says you can consider investing in a company if P/E \* P/BV < 22.5 given a large market cap.

I was looking at some stocks for an example and came across two different worlds.

&#x200B;

* MFGP which currently has P/E=1.03 and P/BV=0.21, with a large market cap. Which seems insane according to this heuristic formula, but all the advisors advising sell until recently and stock price trending down.
* AMD which currently has P/E=166.6 and P/BV=29.72, with a large market cap. Which seems also insane on the other end of the spectrum, but advisors are advising buy and stock is breaking record prices.

My question is why is there such a discrepency? It seems to me like if MFGP should be very safe to invest in even if they fail considering their P/BV, whereas for AMD, even if they 10folded their earnings next year, would be a bad stock for current price.

t3_ik60ts,JP Morgan: Analysis,"I recently did a valuation analysis on JPM using a DDM. The valuation is contingent on certain macroeconomic factors with assumptions such as;

1. The Fed will keep interest rates at zero for the next 5 years 
2. Congress will almost certainly continue passing stimulus bills going forward as there are still cash flow problems due to COVID-19
3. JPM will not cut its dividend under almost any circumstance as they have one of the highest CET1 capital reserves of $191 billion, acting as a buffer protecting the dividend.
4. JPM will return to a normalized ROE and payout ratio when the economy has recovered, but faces slow growth in the future due to very low interest rates and high household & corporate debt levels.

Given the following assumptions, I created 3 scenarios involving a base case, a fast recovery, and a slow recovery. The valuation determines that JPM is worth $133.63

t3_ijnu6v,GoldSport Discoveries,"Let's have a gold talk. In these dire times in which the market gets weirder everyday, commodities seem to be a place to find solace. Gold has been doing good lately and considering the last bullish run it had, it could go on for 3 years. I did a bit a research and tumbled upon [GoldSpot Discoveries Corp.](https://goldspot.ca/) (TSXV:SPOT)

# What Are They Doing?

GoldSpot is a small Canadian company that was created not so long ago on the premise that the use of unutilized geological, geophysical and satellite imagery big data combined with machine learning/artificial intelligence can change the way exploration on a property is done. The goal  is to drive down prices of exploration and offer a simpler way to identify where to mine, but also to elevate the accuracy of metals locations in the ground.You get the idea...I won't get into much details, but if you want more information on the company, [go ahead!](https://goldspot.ca/about-us/) Oh and by the way, don't be fool by the name, the company is also engaged in other metals too (Silver, Nickel, Copper, etc...).

# tl;dr

SPOT is trading at $0.03 over its cash per share metric of $0.10 which is ridiculous considering the ways the company can generate income. With its advances in technology, multiple income stream and its promising portfolio of investments, I believe the company is undervalued by a factor of at least 3. My current estimation of share price is at $0.43 although current market value is $0.14.

# Why the price has gone down and Escrow Shares

If you take a look at SPOT's chart there is a descending trend although it seems somewhat correlated to the fact that the stock took a couple hits...A look up at trading volumes shines a light on 6 different periods. 4 of them are related to the release of escrow shares to the investors under the following schedule:

## Total of common shares:

* *33,489,472*

## Release:

* 25% on *February 20, 2019*;
* 25% on *August 20, 2019*;
* 25% on *February 20, 2020*;
* 25% on *August 20, 2020*

At those times there is usually an important volume of shares being liquidated... The fifth peak in volume is in October 2019 and it can be attributed to investor *Sheldon Inwentash* liquidating a couple millions of shares. Last but not least, last peak that happened about a week ago on August 13th...I am not sure why this happened. Maybe a change in escrow shares release schedule or not, it is yet to be determined.

# Royalties

From what I understood, GoldSpot is primarily doing consulting, but they still seem to make moves on mining projects that look promising. They have royalties portfolios on these 4 properties:

* **New Found Gold Corp** (TSXV:NFG): Net smelter of 0.5%. Consisting of 70,000 hectares in the very prospective project Queensway (19 metres of 92.86 g/t gold, 6 metres of 285.2 g/t gold).
* **Pacton Gold** (TSXV:PAC): 0.5% net smelter. The project is in Red Lake area, Ontario which is close to Great Bear Ressources (TSXV:GBR) who are having tremendous success.
* **One Bullion** : 0.25% net smelter with their lands in South Africa
* **Manitou Gold** (TSXV:MTU): 0.25% net smelter.

New Found Gold is by far the most valuable asset in the portfolio. While digging in the news release I found that GoldSpot previously owned  [1% royalty in Queensway](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/48296/GoldSpot-Discoveries-Provides-Corporate-and-Royalties-Update), so they probably sold 0.5% along the way and with [NFG IPO](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/11/2076427/0/en/New-Found-Gold-Completes-Initial-Public-Offering.html) they probably sold it at a good price. It is hard to price the royalty portfolio because there is no working mine or good resource estimation for there junior miners but with the recent [Gold rally](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/) they didn't go down in value.

# Investments

The bulk of this thesis come from SPOT's investments in some key junior miners. The whole portfolio is not available but from what was publicly disclose, it is possible to assume that these undisclosed assets (investments) are related to mining (why invest elsewhere when you are expert in the industry). With the price of gold going up, these anonymous investments probably surfed the wave along with it. But we can still look at what we know for certain:

* **New Found Gold (TSXV:NFG)**: GoldSpot invested $750,000 in New Found Gold around the [4th of March 2019](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-announces-acquisition-of-royalties-in-two-prolific-districts-covering-over-900000-hectares-and-closing-of-strategic-partnership-with-manitou-gold/#:~:text=GoldSpot's%20royalty%20on%20New%20Found%20Gold's%20project%20is%20over%20~70%2C000%20hectares.&text=Under%20the%20terms%20of%20the,for%20gross%20proceeds%20of%20%2475%2C000). Looking at New Found Gold statements, *On June 18 2019, the company completed a private placement of 1,875,000 Shares at a price of $0.40 for gross proceeds of $750,000*. NFG price as of the time of writting this is [$1.83](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA860CA860&sxsrf=ALeKk02rhg01PwGu5Ed4GkKaxTnC0FTNeg:1598574312912&q=CVE:+NFG&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDbPTC4zLLCwteRaxcjiHuVop-Lm5AwBQAQo0SAAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiXp8Ww0bzrAhWpc98KHR_5CZAQsRUwEXoECA0QAw&biw=2048&bih=1010) taking SPOT's stake to around 3.4 million.
* **NV Gold Corp (TSXV:NVX)**: Their investment more than doubled (now \~1.4 million from 500k), we can read this information from their [CEO's interview](https://www.caesarsreport.com/reports/interview-with-peter-ball-ceo-of-nv-gold/).

Considering only these two investments from their $10M in assets (non-public probably rose as well), their portfolio rose by \~22% since last available financial information. Over the same period, GoldSpot lost \~40% (0.25 to 0.14) taking the capitalization to just under $14M when they have at least $13.35M in assets (adjusting for the gains in NVX and NFG).

# Insiders

One of the reason why the stock is so low can be attributed to a change in management. Frank Holmes (U.S. Global), Donovan Pollitt (Pollitt Mining) and Ramon Barua (Hochschild Mining) [left the company](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-provides-corporate-update/). This would suggest something bad was about to happen for GoldSpot or maybe a divergence of views within the board committee. Since the announcement none of them withdrew ownership in SPOT suggesting it might be more the latter reason. Though, a flow of new deals for GoldSpot indicate they can do it without the three board members [NV Gold](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-enters-into-strategic-data-royalty-relationship-with-nv-gold/), [Yamana](https://goldspot.ca/news/yamana-gold-reengages-goldspot-discoveries-for-its-cerro-moro-gold-and-silver-mine-in-argentina/), [AEX Gold](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-and-aex-gold-inc-sign-an-agreement-to-identify-new-exploration-targets-in-south-greenland/), [Margaux](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-and-margaux-resources-ltd-collaborate-on-series-of-exciting-new-targets-for-drill-campaign/), [Tembo Gold](https://goldspot.ca/news/goldspot-discoveries-corp-to-apply-machine-learning-on-tanzanian-greenstone-belt/).

# Discounted Cash Flow

## What is known

## Consulting Income

One relation that caught my eye is the one between the Consulting Income and the Operating, G&A expenses, that for the moment, are pretty much on par. Looking at the company's past 9 quarters, the consulting income grew somewhat in a straight line at 15% QoQ and looking at the same metric year over year we saw in 2019 a growth rate of 78% YoY. When looking at the Operating and G&A costs, it grew at around 17% QoQ. The operating costs are slightly greater then the consulting incomes, but it could easily be explained by the *surprise* cost of inclusion on the Canadian exchange of about $2M in Q1 of 2019. This is a one time fee that can be ignored for estimating future cash flows.

Since their ideal long term goal is that with the continuous effort put in by the employees, the cost for providing these consulting services will diminish drastically in the future. The assumption goes towards decreasing Operating and G&A expenses and increasing Consulting Incomes.

## Investment Gains

Based on the limited information online about their private portfolio of assets, the two *known* recent investments made in NFG and NVG, initially valued at $1.25M are now estimated at $3.5M as of FY 2020.

## Assumptions

## Growth Rates

Using the data gathered from the company's historical information the following table was made to estimate the future growth of the incomes and costs of the company. Based on the the fact that the company leverages technology, that they've been working at this for 2 and a half years, that they have many projects in their pipeline, and promising Q1 2020 results, the same 80% growth rate between 2018-2019 was used for estimating 2020's results. The rate was subsequently cut in half each year. Terminal perpetual growth rate is set to 3%.

Operating G&A costs modeled at a more modest rate to support the main thesis.

## Projected Income

The investment gains were modeled based on the known information for the year 2020 and used that number for the following years. Assuming there is little known about GoldSpot's portfolio, the fact that royalties will pay for a long time, and their many projects, netting $3.5M over the next 3 years is reasonable. The average gold run also last 3 years. After the investment gains was divided by 2.

## Results

To discount the future cashflow at the present value the following parameters were used. GoldSpot doesn't have much debt and they finance most of the company through equity. Estimating the cost of equity with warrants is tricky and I decided to use a strong 10% to penalize the valuation. Tax rate is given by the government of Canada's website.

 

|Name|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Discount Rate|10%|
|n\_shares|94,724,876|
|Price|0.14|
|Tax rate|9%|

 

Using the cashflow generated in the last table, we added back the small D&A of 21,555 yearly back in the FCFF. Nothing else was added to the FCFF due to the limited amount of information on the financials reports. The terminal value of the company was calculated and brought back to the present value. The yearly estimated cashflow were also brought back to present value. The company's share count grows by around 7% yearly. 101M shares was used to calculate the final expected share price of $0.43.

 

https://preview.redd.it/mq16uzbde8k51.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfad66d286451927594f3418059e9b3ded82d955

&#x200B;

|Name|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Expected CF per Share|0.3210|
|Current Cash per Share|0.1085|
|Expected Share Price|0.4295|
|Current Share Price|0.14|

 

Sitting with a big pile of cash I was curious to see how it reflected per share. It comes out near $0.11/share which is pretty high considering the fact that the company trades at $0.14. The market is basically valuing this company at $0.03/share translating to not even $3M. A company value is reflected the future cashflow and outcome of the company, and I find it interesting that the company is valued at $3M while they will generate at least $3M this year with their investments.

Adding the present value per share of the cashflow and the current cash per share the final estimated share prices comes at around $0.43 which I believe is a much fairer estimated value.

t3_il616f,Dollar Hedging,"USD has declined almost 10% compared to rest of the world. What is the best way to hedge this risk?

I am very new to this, so this post is more asking for a discussion than me providing an answer.

I found this article in Fidelity interesting: [https://www.fidelity.com/insights/markets-economy/prepare-weaker-dollar?ah=1](https://www.fidelity.com/insights/markets-economy/prepare-weaker-dollar?ah=1)

Text:

>U.S. investors are used to a strong dollar, and most don’t pay attention to its fluctuations. But the greenback’s value, relative to other major currencies, has fallen 10% over the past five months—and many expect the slide to continue. Investors have three options—stick to the original portfolio and simply ride out the currency fluctuations; shift into asset classes that tend to do better under a weakening dollar; and/or seek out investments designed to take advantage of a falling dollar.  
>  
>After the greenback suffered its worst month in a decade, investors are wondering why the drop. Here’s a close look at the forces behind it.© Financial Times 2020. These presentations are provided for informational purposes only.  
>  
>The dollar’s recent fall is primarily a result of the U.S. government’s monetary easing policies in response to the pandemic-triggered economic disruptions. Lower interest rates have made the currency less attractive to hold. In addition, the dollar supply surged as the Federal Reserve opened swap lines with other central banks. And the huge fiscal stimulus and mounting national debt have boosted demand for foreign capital.  
>  
>What’s more, as life in many parts of the world has begun to get back on track, the U.S. still doesn’t have Covid-19 under control. “The second-quarter GDP is the weakest we’ve seen on record,” says Schroders investment strategist Whitney Sweeney. “That—along with the increasing coronavirus infections—is really adding to concerns about weaker economic growth in the U.S. Simply being the haven is not going to be enough to bolster the dollar going forward.”  
>  
>Indeed, this might be the beginning of an extended dollar decline, says Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. She expects the currency to drop another 5% to 10% in the next year or two. “The Fed’s forward guidance says they’ll keep the rates low and liquidity ample for a couple of years. That’s a signal to the market that they don’t have a lot to fear in other currencies,” she says. “Investors have been heavily weighted in dollar assets, and now might be the time to diversify a little more broadly.”  
>  
>Investors could dial up their allocation to international assets, which typically benefit from a weakening dollar. Since foreign-based companies report their earnings in the local currency, U.S. investors will enjoy a larger gain when translating those numbers into dollars. For a well-diversified exposure, the $24 billion Vanguard Total International Stock ETF ( [VXUS](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=VXUS) ), which owns some 7,000 stocks from more than 45 countries, returned 18% over the past three months, beating the SPDR S&P 500 ( [SPY](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=SPY)) by more than two percentage points.  
>  
>Investors should check whether an international fund is hedged against currency fluctuations or not. The hedged funds can protect returns when the dollar strengthens but will underperform when a cheaper dollar gives international assets an extra lift. While hedged and unhedged funds generate similar returns over the long run, in the short term, there can be big differences. Over the past three months, for example, the $49 billion iShares MSCI EAFE exchange-traded fund ( [EFA](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=EFA) ) gained 16.2%, while the $2.3 billion iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF ( [HEFA](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=HEFA) ) returned just 9.9%. “If the dollar continues to weaken, the unhedged funds should do better than the hedged funds,” says Morningstar ETF specialist Alex Bryan.  
>  
>A falling dollar can lead to inflation—higher prices for everything from apparel to airline fares. The core consumer price index, while still running lower than a year ago, jumped 0.6% from June to July, marking the fastest monthly rise since 1991. Yet, many economists say it’s too soon to worry. “We doubt that the rise in CPI in July is the start of a trend to higher inflation,” says Jones. “With the unemployment rate over 10% and excess capacity in so many industries, it’s unlikely that inflation can move up in a meaningful way this year.”  
>  
>Investors who want to be extra-cautious can shift some of their Treasuries into Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, whose face value rises with the consumer price index. Due to the Treasuries’ very low yields, however, Jones says that investors should “purely look at it as a hedge, rather than something that can produce income.”  
>  
>Hard assets like commodities are another hedge against inflation. Precious metals, in particular, have soared lately. ETFs such as the $33 billion iShares Gold Trust ( [IAU](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=IAU) ) and $14 billion iShares Silver Trust ( [SLV](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=SLV) ) are backed by physical commodities and closely track their prices. The $967 million Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking ETF ( [DBC](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=DBC) ) offers a broader exposure, with futures contracts on 14 heavily traded commodities. Stock in companies that mine and trade commodities are another option, though usually more volatile.  
>  
>Finally, to specifically profit from a falling dollar, investors can directly bet on foreign currencies through the $76 million Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bearish ETF ( [UDN](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=UDN) ), which shorts the U.S. Dollar Index futures contracts and makes money if the dollar drops against six other major currencies. Be aware of the concentration risk; the euro alone accounts for half of the move.  
>  
>Morningstar’s Bryan recommends the iShares International Treasury Bond ETF ( [IGOV](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=IGOV) ) as a more diversified alternative; it owns a broad basket of government bonds from non-U.S. developed markets. Since interest rates in these countries are close to zero, the fund largely moves against the dollar’s value. But that also means no additional gains besides the currency movement.

t3_ily5ae,DCF of Canadian Solar ($CSIQ) using unlevered free cash flow -- a potential 53% profit?,"Edit: some recalculation for the fair value made my upside slightly incorrect. It should be ~46% upside.

**Background**

Canadian Solar (CSIQ) is a manufacturer of solar photovoltaic modules and provides solar energy solutions. It operates through the Module and System Solutions (MSS) and Energy segments. The MSS segment involves in the design, development, manufacture, and sales of solar power products and solar system kits, and operation and maintenance services. The Energy segment comprises primarily of the development and sale of solar projects, operating solar power projects and the sale of electricity. The company is headquartered in Guelph, Canada.

**Why the Interest?**

This company hit my radar as I was playing around with a stock screener (around 2 months ago). For what is arguably a semiconductor and energy company, it was ridiculously cheap. Here are the current ratios:

- P/E: 8.65

- Forward P/E: 7.88

- EV/S: 0.87

- EV/EBITDA: 6.54

- EV/EBIT: 7.50

- PEG: 0.35

- P/S: 0.53

- P/B: 1.21

Without even necessarily reseaching, it is obvious that this is much cheaper than its sector, and even industry. What's the catch though?

**Debt and Profits**

This company has a lot of debt relative to its equity. Some ratios:

- Debt/Equity: 2.90

- Net debt/EBITDA: 2.43

- Current ratio: 1.15

- Quick ratio: 0.95

With a market cap of $1.69B, it holds a total of $3.061B in debt. It's margins aren't the healthiest when compared to its competitors too:

- Profit margin: 5.36%

- Oper. margin: 11.62%

- Gross margin: 22.45%

- EBIT margin: 11.62%

- EBITDA margin: 13.34%

However, it does have nice prospects of growing as seen by its growing revenue, and recently beating expectations in earnings and revenue. Some more ratios:

- Ret. on assets: 4.82%

- Ret. on equity: 18.12%

- ROIC: 4.35%

- ROCE: 15.07%

**DCF Valuation**

My 5 year projection DCF valuation is available to view and download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJOL19mwh9XZqX2aS6dP9TccGZV04Pbc/view?usp=sharing).

Highlights:

- Average revenue growth of 17.5% for the next 5 years (many projects in the pipeline, high at first, lower later)

- 20% future tax rate (low because of future tax policy favouring green energy)

- CapEx starting high at 15% for the first two years and then 10% for the next 3

- Cost of Debt (after taxes) is 2.7%, Cost of Equity 15.2%, WACC 8.1%

- Perpetual Growth Rate of 2.5% (average for most fimrs)

- Final EV: $5 234.1MM

- Fair Value Equity: $2 662.4MM

- **Fair Value Equity/Share: $44.84**

**Current upside (with share value @ 30.75) of 46%**

Any criticism and ideas are very much appreciated. This is my first **real** DCF, and I hope I got things correct.

One thing I wanted to do was a 5 factor model for the Cost of Equity, but I had a hard time finding the specific risk betas for the company. Anyway, I hope 15% is enough of the cost of equity anyway.

I wrote this up pretty quickly, and in hindsight I would have spent more time on the upside and downside catalysts ('bull case' and 'bear case'?). I would have also ran a 10-year forecast, used a lower RFR and a lower terminal value commencing at end of 10-year forecast. 

Hi folks, been invested in FB for a bit over a year and entered into first position at \~$160. With 30% YTD increase in share price and recent run-up of tech I thought I would write a quick long thesis on why I am still invested.

Please let me know in the comments what you think and any suggestions you have. Do you agree / disagree and why?

**Disclaimer**: This is not investment advice and I am not a licensed investment professional. this post is purely for for discussion purposes. Invest at your own risk.

**Summary**:

* **Current Price**: $302 per share
* **Target Price**: $350 per share
* **Implied upside**: 16%

**Commercial**

* Monthly active users (""MAU"") grew 8% y/y to 2.5 billion in 2019. Growth in the US, Canada and Europe was flat y/y with primary growth from Asia-Pacific and Rest of World
* Average revenue per user (""ARPU"") grew 17% y/y to $29.25 in 2019. On a constant market-by-market basis, ARPU grew 24% in the United States & Canada, 20% in Europe, 18% in Asia‑Pacific, and 16% in Rest of World.
* FB continues to innovate product offering and has recently launched *Reels* and *Instagram Shop* which should continue to monetize platform and grow ARPU
* Consumers are increasingly purchasing online, accelerated by adoption due to COVID-19. Older and wealthier demographic, which has been the slowest adopt online shopping have been introduced to online economy out of necessity.

**Risks**

* US anti-trust legislation, consumer privacy and content moderation hang over stock and could increase run-rate cost structure
* Though not yet played out, consumer spending decrease could cause online advertising spend to decrease, causing short-term volatility to earnings
* New platforms such as TikTok could take away market share from younger demographic and eat into long-term growth in MAU and ARPU

**Forecast Assumptions**

* **Sales**: Growth of 18% in 2020, decreasing steadily to 12% in 2024 in line with historical trend, and ARPU and MAU growth. Consumer sentiment continues for remainder of year and holiday spending season.
* **Cost structure**: 45% sustainable EBITDA margin and 22% capex load, which includes investments to content moderation, internal product development, and server expansion to support growth in content and video.
* **Tax** increasing to 28% to account for proposal from democrats to add conservatism

**Capital Structure**

* 91% equity financed; 9% debt
* Cash reserves fully cover debt, resulting in net cash balance of  $47B

**Cost of Capital:** 7.75% based on:

* ERP of 5.5%
* 5-year monthly Beta of 1.2 x
* Cost of debt of 1.8%
* Risk free rate of 1.7% (Higher than conventional RFR. used this as a 'plug' to increase discount rate to account for historically low interest rates and uncertainty of anti-trust legislation)
* Terminal Growth Rate of 6% (slightly higher than I would typically use, but felt appropriate given current growth rate trends, population growth and industry)

**Comps Analysis & Football**

* Very few comps to work with here given nature of industry. Focus of quality over quantify in comps.
* FB offers exceedingly good value in terms of both growth and valuation in comparison to peers, trading at roughly the same TEV/EBITDA to Alphabet but growing at twice the pace.

And then I play around a 25-year dcf based on the CAGR above in the second post.

I believe ""following"" Unity might pay dividend:

1. Engine has very long runway which is subscription-based;
2. There's uncertainty around the robustness of advertising revenue & other Operate Solutions (if any) which is rev-share / usage based;
3. Current rich SaaS valuation might spoil over to non-subscription based business (Operate Solutions) at IPO which is a source of de-rating in addition to multiple contraction;
4. Relatively high advertising revenue contribution and uncertainty of its robustness (growth) might create of volatility in overall growth;
5. \#3 & #4 might be source of drawdown of the stock sometime in the future which might create very attractive long term opportunity if it's not acquired by strategic buyers or financial investors.

1.) Hairy, foreign listed small-cap airline and trades only 3m USD / day - high discoverability
2.) Poor sell-side coverage - despite significant interim newsflow, including the almost-complete recovery of volumes to pre-COVID levels, US sell-side coverage has not updated models since July. For example, current consensus capacity for 3Q reflects roughly 4,122k ASMs vs. 4,800 based on actuals through Aug and mgmts stated planes for Sep
3.) Sellside and buyside always fails to model the impact of upgauging and fuel efficiency during significant fleet transitions - many sellside models either don't model the fleet or actually apply the wrong number of seats entirely, underestimating growth implied and incremental costs associated
4.) Market anchors to minimum contractual fleet without consideration of significant ability to extend leases or pull forward deliveries if the recovery remains strong, especially if additional capital is raised 
5.) IFRS 15 and 16 changes make spot check comparisons messy and the capital structure look worse than reality
6.) Persistent overcapacity in recent years is not reflective of earnings power in a more consolidated market. In 2019, Interjet was discounting aggressively to generate cash in an effort to maintain solvency which depressed fares below rational levels


Key Investment Factors:

1.) Accelerating secular growth of Mexican aviation demand – From 2007 to 2018 air trips per capita in Mexico has grown from 0.25 to 0.36 compared to 0.72 for Chile and 0.45 for Brazil. Since VLRS’s founding in 2006, the domestic market has grown at a CAGR of 7.6%, international market at 4.9% (US transborder >20%) and total Mexican market 6.2%. Mexico’s demographics are supportive, with a young population and an emerging middle class expected to comprise 50% of the population by 2032

2.) Bus switching presents a long runway for sustained growth – Mexico’s inter-city bus market is 70x the size of the air market (>3bn bus pax vs. 54m air pax in 2019). 41% of VLRS’s routes pre-COVID had only bus competition and VLRS sees buses as the primarily competitor and source of growth. Amazingly, VLRS flights are actually cheaper in many cases than the competing bus trips and VLRS runs ticket giveaways at bus stations to convert first time flyers. First time flyers comprised 6% of 2019 passengers and 82% of passengers surveyed would not travel by bus again. COVID has pulled forward bus switching given the difference in trip duration. 

3.) Market share gains from 30%+ reduction of domestic capacity and collapse of primary competitors – 
a. VLRS has captured ~50% of the growth in the domestic market since its founding and has grown from a 4% in 2006 share to 31.1% in 2019. In July, VLRS held 45% share of the domestic market which is sustainable and could grow further. 
b. Aeromexico’s domestic market share has shrunk from 40% in 2011 to 24% in 2019 as the legacy carrier has basically ceded the domestic market to ULCCs and runs it primarily to feed international travel. Aeromexico is currently in chapter 11 and is expected to reduce its fleet by at least 30%. 
c. Interjet (19.7% 2019 domestic share) is the 3rd largest ULCC, but is the most important competitor to VLRS since they share Toluca as their main hubs and since Interjet has been aggressively discounting since 2018 in order to manage solvency issues. 60 of Interjet’s 66 planes have been repossessed leaving them with a ragtag fleet of six barely operable Russian Sukhoi Superjets. 
d. Viva Aerobus is another ULCC with 20.2% of the market in 2019, through Viva tends to stay in its lane geographically and focus in different airports than Volaris. Viva will definitely be looking to take their slice of Interjet’s and Aeromexico’s forfeited routes and slots, though its unlikely they’d be overaggressive with VLRS in an environment of massive undersupply

4.) Expanding and sustainable cost advantage embedded in underappreciated fleet transition – VLRS has the second lowest unit cost in the world and has a RASM lower than Aeromexico’s CASM. Airbus NEO (new engine option) are roughly 10% cheaper on a unit cost basis, driven by fuel efficiency (-14% to -16% fuel burn per seat) and increased gauge (operating leverage on per-departure and per aircraft costs like pilot wages, landing fees, etc.). NEO aircraft currently make up 30% of seats in the fleet and the latest fleetplan has that growing to ~60% by 2023 (and >90% by 2026 depending on lease extensions and deferrals), Overall this translates to a ~1% embedded annual reduction in CASM through 2026 assuming no other other cost improvements off of 2019. Said differently, we expect VLRS’s average seats per aircraft to grow from 185 today to 198 by 2026.

5.) Upside from price and/or fleet flexibility – VLRS has pushed out 24 neo deliveries from 2020-2022 to 2027-2028 in order to save USD$200m of predelivery payments – if demand recovers more quickly VRLS could reaccelerate those orders and grow the fleet 20%+ in the next three years. VLRS has historically also extended leases beyond the contractual redelivery date, though the published fleet plan only reflects contractual deliveries and redeliveries. VLRS remains nimble and able to accelerate growth and take share if demand is strong or to recover pricing and build cash

6.) Ancillary revenue upside – since 2011 non-ticket revenue per passenger has grown at a ~19% CAGR, and remains below comparable global ULCC peers in absolute value and % of revenue. We’d expect this to grow per management’s comments and historical execution, as well as supportive baggage attach rate data through July

7.) Additional growth opportunities from newly-freed slots in previously capacity-constrained Mexico City and expansion into Central America – Historically capacity constrained Mexico City airport has use-it-or-lose-it rules and given the fleet outlook, the incumbents (Aeromexico and Interjet) look as if they will finally lose it, opening the door for VLRS to land-grab valuable slots. VLRS is in the early stages of ramping up subsidiaries in Costa Rica and El Salvador, both of which are high-priced markets with limited ULCCs penetration and significant growth opportunities (watch out CPA)

Risks/Mitigants:
1.) Travel recovery - globally, passenger travel has been slow to recover, with some suggesting a structurally lower level of travel as the ""new normal"". VLRS carries primarily VFR and leisure traffic which is more resilient and quicker to recover than corporate travel, but of course the future is unknown and a second shutdown could increase the risk of a dilutive issuance.

2.) Liquidity - while VLRS is net-positive cash ex-leases and has executed a substantial and impressive liquidity preservation plan (see 2Q20 call and latest investor pres), a second shutdown VLRS would potentially require a further deferral of deliveries, limiting VLRS’s ability to fully capitalize on the opportunity market share opportunity. The company said on the 2Q20 call they expect 40-45m USD of monthly cash burn in 3Q20 and that all incremental capacity decisions would be made on the basis of incremental cash contributions - given the capacity recovery since the call we expect the 3Q20 exit rate to be much lower. VLRS is a critical customer to airbus, airports and other suppliers and we would expect further deferrals or negotiations to be successful if travel deteriorates from here

3.) Potential equity or convert issuance - The board has convened an Extraordinary Assembly for 9/18/20 at which they're expected to propose an issuance of debt, converts or shares. The uncertainty creates an overhang, but we believe it is more likely driven by a desire to re-establish a more aggressive fleet plan that was tempered in the depth of the crisis. We would expect that senior debt markets remain open to VLRS.

4.) Uncertain overhang from extended booking period - VLRS extended their booking period out to Oct 2021 and offered 125% flight credits for customers willing to re-book which could be an overhang on unit revenue through 2021, though the does maximize volumes on which to earn ancillary revenue and maximized aircraft utilization. This was a wise move by mgmt to minimize cash outflows from refunds, but with air traffic liability greater than 1/2 of available cash, a second shutdown could reintroduce liquidity risk or extend fare weakness a few quarters into the recover (though we’d expect this to be made up with close in pricing if travel surprises to the upside)

5.) General FX and macro related to Mexico

Catalysts: 
1.) Consistently improving monthly traffic reports and 3Q earnings to drive positive earnings revisions even if general air traffic recovery is weak
2.) Earnings power in the post-COVID competitive environment to become clear
3.) Removal of overhang form potential capital raise following 9/18 board meeting
4.) Further clarification of Viva and Aeromexico's post-COVID fleet outlooks
5.) Re-launch of Central American expansion and reintroduction of use-it-or-lose provisions in Mexico City, forcing the expected official forfeit by peers of slots temporarily granted to VLRS

Management/Holders highlights: 
1.) Indigo Partners/Bill Franke: Volaris is backed (15% current stake) by budget-airline guru Bill Franke's firm Indigo Partners, which also has stakes in Eastern-European carrier Wizz (another write-up to follow), Chile's Jetsmart and Frontier (with which Volaris has recently introduced a codeshare agreement with). Collectively, Indigo has an orderbook of 636 Airbus A320-family neo and XLR aircraft. Bill Franke is the former CEO of America West, Chairman of Wizz and Frontier. Indigo also launched and has since exited Spirit Airlines and Singapore's Tiger Air. Doug Parker (AAL CEO) and Scott Kirby (UAL CEO) are among the airline industry leaders originally hired by Bill Franke to America West. Other notable founding Volaris investors include Harry Krensky’s Discovery Americas (current stake 2.41%), as well as Latin American business giants Carlos Slim, Emilio Azcárraga (Televisa) and Roberto Kriete (TACA) (current stake 7.6%).

2.) CEO Enrique Beltranena (0.9% holder) has been an aviation fanatic since 8 years old and joined the industry with his home country of Guatemala’s Aviateca during privatization in 1988. He became general manager of the Aviateca and was responsible for its merger with, Sahsa, Nica, Lacsa and TACA Peru, forming a Grupo TACA and later serving as COO for the group. In 2003 the TACA boarded asked Beltrarena to develop plans for interconnecting airlines in Latin America – one of the six resulting plans was Volaris. In 2005, Beltranena left the 6,800-employee Grupo TACA founded with Volaris

3.) Enrique is supported by EVP Holger Blankenstein since VLRS’s founding, former Bain consultant who heads VLRS’s data-intensive approach to everything from network, fares, marketing and labor

t3_ix1g0c,AMC Networks ($AMCX) -- A Deep Value Play with a Near-Term Catalyst,"I'm still pretty new at this, so constructive feedback much appreciated!

AMC Networks ($AMCX) is a media company that owns cable channels, including AMC and BBC America. It’s also the channel responsible for some of the most iconic television shows of the past two decades, including *Mad Men* and *Breaking Bad*. 

**Thesis:**

AMC is a deep value play currently trading at an 5-6x EV/EBIT and 50% FCF yield that offers a near-term catalyst in the form of a 20% buy-back program over the next month. Combined with the fact that \~20% of the float is currently short, there is the potential for a rapid rise in price.

**Decline of Linear TV**

The major concern of cable companies is the trend of cord cutting and the rise of streaming services. I am not here to argue against this trend — I think it is one that will continue to prove itself true in the coming years. AMC, however, is doing a reasonable job of adjusting to this new medium, and it is still in fairly good financial health. Let’s unpack both of these points further:

1.  The transition into streaming

* AMC currently has niche programming that is available via streaming video on demand (SVOD). AMC currently projects its five SVOD programs will have between 3.5-4million subscribers at $5/month. Assuming it hits the lower end of that estimate brings AMC an addition $210 million of revenue, good for over 16% of its current market cap. By comparison, Disney+ has over 60 million subscribers. While AMC’s SVOD caters only to niche audiences, that may be enough. SVOD is not meant to compete against Netflix or Disney+; it’s meant to complement these other streaming services. During the Q2 call, AMC noted that 80% of its SVOD subscribers also subscribe to a mainstream streaming service

2.  Financial Viability

* Revenue has continued to grow in the sub-5% clip, YoY pre-Covid. Revenue is down this year due to decrease in ad spending, though it is reasonable to expect an uptick due to Election season. The company has also earned in the neighborhood $6-7 per share in the past three years, though numbers are again down Q1 and Q2 2020 ($1.47 and $0.28, respectively). The company has \~$800 million in cash, but it also has $2 billion in net debt. However, the company has consistently earned their market cap in free cash flow for the past few years, and I don’t view this debt as a major risk.

**Catalyst**

The company announced a $250 million share buyback (all in cash) this past week that will be completed in the coming month, which represents about 20% of all shares outstanding. Combine this with the fact that \~20% of the current float is short, and you have the potential for a major short squeeze.",25,0.89,1600698424,"[['AMC', 6], ['FCF', 1]]",AMC,5.139999866485596,4.940000057220459
t3_j2cz5t,Auckland Airport Beginner Fundamental Analysis,"Hey guys,

I'm a new investor and decided to try somewhat of a fundamental analysis in accordance with a book I have been reading. I decided to do it on Auckland Int. Airport ([AIA.NZ](https://aia.nz/)) due to their strong competitive advantage (monopoly) and the hopeful improving travel conditions b/w NZ and Aus. Any advice/direction on how to better the analysis would be greatly appreciated as most of the valuations are around half of the current share price.

\- Margin of Safety (MOS) was set at 20%

\- 5YR GR was average EPS growth rate over the past 5 years

The fundamentals of AIA supported the books principles in that it has a good BV and Profit growth over time, as well has reduced its D/E to below 50%.

However, it lacks strength in ROE (advised was 10-15% avg.) and FCF (advised was positive FCF over 10yr).

t3_j494kf,Interesting Question from Client,"Pension client asked me to determine the amount interest rates would have to increase for the plan to be fully funded. Computing the MV change in the bond portfolio is easy. 

Then it had me wondering.... on the equity side of the equation what would prompt the fed to raise rates? And what would the outcome be for equity markets? The only rational thing that makes sense is an inflation print way above 2% where the fed gets worried about it running away from them. FOMC has already said they need to see sustained prints above 2% to even consider raising rates. Given the fragile state of the current economy now and for the immediate future, increasing rates would almost certainly constrain consumption with the cost of money increasing.

What is the most appropriate way to estimate the impact to equity markets? What do you think is a conservative estimate for downward % shock to equities? Looks like based on LDI portfolio I’d estimate a shock of rates somewhere between +400 to +500 is where they would need to land to get to fully funded. Clearly impact to equity markets has less of an impact than the movements in rates impact to the PBO and bond sleeve. Appreciate anyone’s insight on estimate equity selloff for the purposes of this silly question.",50,0.89,1601697313,"[['LDI', 1]]",,,
t3_j59ihi,Huntington Ingalls Industries: A discounted defense stock in uncertain times,"**Overview**

* HII is a mid-cap defense contractor that builds destroyers, aircraft carriers, and nuclear submarines for the U.S Navy, U.S Coast Guard, and allies.
* Over the last few months, the stock has taken a huge hit (-28.22% YTD) due to COVID and a worse than expected earnings miss (-68%) in the most recent quarter. 
* Valuation, healthy fundamentals, and competitive moat suggest **\~27% upside** to current price.

Currently America’s biggest military shipbuilder, Huntington was spun off Northrop Grumman’s shipbuilding segment in 2011 and has steadily grown ever since then. The business comprises of three segments: Ingalls, which produces assault ships, surface combatants, and cutters; Newport, which produces nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers; and Technical Solutions, which is their newest segment, offers consulting services to the DoD and private sector companies. 

**Fundamentals**

* Median revenue growth is 5.3%, which is expected considering that 87% of their revenues come from the DoD.
* Consistent ROIC growth from 11% to 19% over 10 years, compared to industry average of 5.9%.
* As a mature company, HII has focused on delivering better bottom line growth, with an operating income CAGR of 13.6%.
* Healthy backlog of $46.5 billion, cash flows should be safe over the next few years.

**Valuation**

* Discount rate: 4.62% given exposure to mostly U.S based customers, low cost of debt.
* Revenues: Negative growth next year due to the pandemic, adjusted to 3% as defense spending increases. Management has been focusing on expanding the Technical Solutions segment which should increase growth over the long term.
* Operating margins: Even though product demand was relatively unaffected, Huntington was heavily impacted by the pandemic due to the shipyards only being allowed to operate at 65% capacity, which lowered margins. As they implement safety protocols, operation capacity should be expected to revert to normal levels in a few years.
* ROIC and reinvestment are maintained at current levels.
* Value of equity per share is $**197.20**, while the stock was trading at $144.13.

[HII Valuation](https://preview.redd.it/jtne28su36r51.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=35ab805a30f2f070314407b50c1ae96bf9262c2c)

**Risks**

* Election: Defense stocks are almost always volatile during election years, although neither Pres. Trump nor Biden are planning any defense spending cuts, volatility should be expected in the near term.
* COVID-19: Future lockdowns and outbreaks could affect production and impact margins.

t3_j9akfz,Is ROIC an adequate measure of return for REITs?,"Hi Everyone,

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to post this here or in the CFA thread, but I guess I could receive some sound advice.

Basically below is a photo from the L1 Equity section in the CFA material, and it shows that Real estate companies are actually destroying value.

https://preview.redd.it/iiycexw9cis51.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ea707e459a2ddd21d39da85270ef862a826b69a

Do you think that's true in practice, or is it just a cause of the reporting standards?

I also try to use the valuation model template from Ashwath Damodaran, and his reinvestment assumptions are also based on ROIC. My problem is that I'm hitting a wall when trying to value REIT companies, as I don't think that those are some good measures, since they are all based on net income instead of FFO.

If someone here is working in the real estate industry, could you help me understand what measures of return do you use for valuation? And also how do you project for reinvestments?",36,0.91,1602440764,"[['ROIC', 1]]",ROIC,10.680000305175781,10.510000228881836
t3_jclsq6,Analysis of Unity Software ($U),"Hi All,

This is my first time posting on this sub. 

I did a deep-dive on Unity Software ($U) recently, which I believe is an interesting opportunity.  Would love to know what you all think.

I have posted a summary version here. If you are interested in a more detailed version, you can find it here: [https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/unity-u-creating-the-future](https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/unity-u-creating-the-future)

**Unity Software ($U)**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What does it do?**

Unity is a very cool company and an impressive business. It makes two types of products:

**Create Solutions: 30% of revenue**

Software which allows creators (artists, developers etc.) to develop many different types of content across platforms (Mobile, PC, incl. Virtual Reality). The company charges a monthly subscription fee for this solution, across various tiers. Smash hit *Pokemon Go* was built on Unity.

**Operate Solutions: 61% of revenue**

A wide variety of software and solutions that allow content / game creators to operate and monetize their games (e.g. analytics to optimize engagement, In-App Purchases). Unity charges a share of the revenue that content /game creators make or sometimes usage based fee. This is a healthy business model as it grows with the usage of any game / content using Unity operate solutions.

Key to note here is that customers can use Operate solutions even on content that was not created on Unity.

**I like:**

* High gross margins (80%)
* Large Gaming TAM ($12B, growing at 6%) and Non Gaming TAM ($17B)
* Lot of room to grow in Non Gaming category
* Accelerating revenue growth, but cost efficient
* Asymmetric opportunity to benefit if VR becomes a dominant technology in future

**I don’t like:**

* Platform risk (dependency on Apple / Google)
* Dynamic competition leading to pressure on free cash flows

One thing I really liked about Unity was their focus to grow their large customers (>$100k TTM revenue) from 389 to 716 in last 10 quarters. This results in a lot of sales efficiency.

Additionally, their dollar net expansion rate is 122-142% in the last 10 quarters (this means a customer who spent $100 last quarter, spend $122-$142 this quarter - a very positive sign). Unity’s net expansion rates are in the upper quartile of all high growth SaaS companies.

One of the key risks I see with Unity is platform risk. As we saw with Epic games recently, Google and Apple control Unity’s access to its customers and this poses platform risk for Unity. This is a serious issue and not unique to them, but they have to find a way around this. Their foray outside gaming should help to some extent.

Another key point is that they are in an industry where they have to constantly innovate and have dynamic competition. Their R&D cost grew by 40% YoY to $167M in H1, 2020 and now represent 47% of its revenue. This is quite high and a drain on cash flows. Unity has to continue to perform well on revenue growth, else cash flows can suffer a lot in future which will become a risk on stock price.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Valuation**

Unity had a spectacular IPO (no surprises) on Sept 18, and since then has gone on to reach a market cap of $22B (\~$83.5 / share, ending Friday Oct 2, 2020), resulting in an EV / Sales (TTM) of 35.3.  This valuation puts it in the category of other high growth SaaS companies like Docusign, Cloudflare who are also growing revenue upwards of 40%. 

Overall I like Unity’s leading position, and its future growth prospects. The valuations are quite rich as is with the sector in general. I would look for any decent drop as a good opportunity for opening new positions.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you continue to find this post useful, please let me know - I will share similar takes of other interesting growth stocks as well recent IPOs like Palantir, Amwell etc.

t3_jgati7,Analyzing High Yield Bonds,"Hi All,

I have a question about analyzing bonds. Specifically high yield. When you go about analyzing a stock, you do a DCF and comparable analysis to come to a target price and that allows you to make a buy or sell recommendation. What is the equivalent of this on high yield bonds? I feel like the interest rate is the most important part but how do you forecast the future spread a company will face, given your outlook on the companies cash flows?

Also if you could point me to any resources or books that would be amazing. I am a CFA level III candidate, so it's not like I don't know the basics of most of the topics. It's just the actual process for high yield investing seems less tangible to me.

t3_ji0i4d,How to profit off Global Warming: HVAC Market Research with Due Dilligence on 5 Air-Conditioner brands.,"# If you find this interesting please follow my account for more DD.

# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!

**Introduction**

With the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. 

**Finding our compatible companies.** 

I only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) 

1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)

2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). 

3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). 

4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). 

5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)

**Understanding the HVAC market.**

Before we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.

Some facts: 

1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. 

2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. 

3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).

4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.

5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).

6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.

As can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.

\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.

\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.

\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.

\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.

\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.

\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.

**Market share.**

This was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:

\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.

\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.

\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.

\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.

\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%

My conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.

**Conclusion**

First of all, I should start with saying that Lennox really shouldn’t have been included, they are on a completely different level than these 4 other companies. Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.

Looking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:

\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.

\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.

\- Daikin spends the most on R&D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.

\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.

\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.

\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise

\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.

\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. 

\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio

\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.

\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M

Now on to the less financial aspect of the data.

I really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.

To conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",153,0.91,1603657707,"[['AC', 8], ['TTM', 1]]",AC,33.79999923706055,33.130001068115234
t3_jiyhkp,Questions for a CEO,"I am invested in a small, privately owned startup company with a group of friends. This was an opportunity that became available as a result of a connection I made, and only required a small investment ($10k) that could potentially result in a 5-10x return over the years. 

The investor group is making a visit to the company and will have an audience with the CEO and several other key members of the organization. 

I would like to put a list of questions together that might be relevant to me, the investor. 

This company is involved in rapidly charging battery technology. They have gone through their Series A and B rounds and have completed all their fundraising, and are working toward executing the purchase orders they’ve received, procuring grant monies, continuing to develop technology, marketing themselves to companies like Tesla and cell phone companies, and things of that nature. 

Our investment is in the form of a convertible loan. The company is current with all interest payments. Our main questions are obviously geared toward profitability as well as the timeline for when our interest in the firm will convert to ownership shares. We will also ask questions regarding revenue projections, profitability, and other debt structures than ours. 

I am wondering what other, important questions I might ask the CEO, and thought to reach out to reddit to find some good, key questions.",23,0.86,1603793804,"[['B', 1]]",B,37.70000076293945,40.130001068115234
t3_jljszn,What we found after analyzing Hollysys Automation for more than 6 months," 

As a value investor, one of the things I look out for is a catalyst for price realisation. After all, even if a stock is criminally undervalued, if it does not have something in its future that will cause other people to wake up to its value, it could stay undervalued forever. Today I’m going to talk about a company that has a very clear catalyst which the value, as well as price of the stock, hinges upon. If the catalyst is positive, the upside is enormous, with the stock possibly doubling or tripling almost overnight.

It all started about 6 months ago when I decided to analyse automation. The coming 4th Industrial Revolution will see human-performed tasks being done by robots, and companies that provide these automation services could do very well indeed. After a quick screen, Hollysys Automation Technologies immediately jumped out at me: the company presented itself with spectacular financials characterized by high liquidity; low debt; steadily growing FCF/revenue/net income over the decade; consistent book value; an average ROE of 15% over a decade, ROCE 13%, a stock price trading at a 30-50% discount compared to competitors, and DCF models estimating a value of $30-40 (currently trading about $11). In other words, the dream of any value investor.

I will be the first to admit I don’t have as much knowledge in the automation industry as I’d like – and that’s something I’ve been working on over the past few months. So, after a quick look at their impressive financial statements, our next step was to talk to the IR of the various Hollysys competitors to better understand the competitive environment that Hollysys were operating in, and whether they could preserve their impressive return ratios over the long term.

As a quick overview of the company, Hollysys operates in two segments: industrial automation and railway automation. In industrial, most of the company’s revenue comes from automating fossil fuel energy plants. It would not be unfair to compare it to a defence company or a public contractor, since the Chinese Communist Party controls the state railways and owns a 75% stake in SINOPEC, China's largest and most important oil company. In addition, the company also has a dominant market position in safety systems for nuclear power plants in China, a sector that is growing with a CAGR of 17%, bringing the number of reactors in the country from 16 in 2012 to 56 in 2020. As the only certified provider of nuclear automation services in the country, HOLI has a monopoly in this subsector.

In the railway sector they hold a 30% market share, and they do not expect further increases in market share. Long-term organic revenue growth is likely to be 5%, primarily coming from after-sale services. However, they are actively researching new products such as CBTC (Communications-based train control) in subways, smart systems on highways, etc. If these products gain traction, which they should, then growth will be higher. Also, the company proved to have a great competitive advantage in the high-speed railway field as they are 1 of the 3 approved providers in 300-350km/h segment and 200-250km/h and the largest company in terms of ATP (on board equipment) sets.

In their ‘Smart factories’ subsegment, they provide solutions to accelerate product development cycles for large white goods companies like Haier. They provide integrated data collection products like SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), data utilisation and analysing services to understand the application situations, designing the system architecture, data management and so on, being the largest company in terms of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. Another example of this subsegment of industrial automation would be their contract with Diaobignshan where they used to collect data to build a factory virtually and rapidly iterated designs to optimise efficiencies at low cost. They provide after-build services such as combustion optimization, equipment monitoring and maintenance, etc. This segment generates real tangible returns for customers, with higher production efficiencies and lower cost. However, it’s worth noting that some of their revenue in this segment comes from fossil fuel companies as well, so a surge in renewable builds could see revenue dropping even more than it would appear at first glance.

All the segments that Hollysys operates in have been growing impressively for the past few years, at a rate above even the high growth of the general Chinese economy. To fuel their supply-side based growth, fossil fuel plants have been opening across China at an unprecedented rate, while China’s high-speed railway network has gone from virtually non-existent 15 years ago to being 2/3rds of the entire world’s track length. As Chinese wages rise, the pressure on factory owners to automate is also increasing to stave off price competition from South-East Asian competitors.

So far, the situation all looks good from a high-level company view. But when you either zoom out to look at the macro environment, or in to look at the specifics of the business, cracks begin showing.

The situation with the Chinese government is tricky – and not for the reason you might think. Despite the fact that most of HOLI’s revenue comes from state-owned entities, and it’s monopolistic market position also dependent on the government, we do not see the government introducing competition to the market to drive down prices as a big threat. China has applied a protect-and-nurture strategy for domestic companies in every sector you could think of very successfully, creating such behemoths as Tencent and Alibaba. You prevent superior foreign competition from entering the market, and choose a winner for each sector, allowing it to take monopolistic profits to accelerate the rate of innovation and shorten the timeline that it needs to compete with foreign companies. From the past decade, Hollysys is the chosen winner for the sectors that it competes in, and that the threat of increased competition due to the Chinese government is virtually non-existent. Companies like Siemens or ABB still have objectively superior products and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Until HOLI catches up with them and can compete in a global free market, the handholding from the government will not end.

However, while the Chinese government will not introduce competition to the markets that HOLI competes in, whether it will continue to incentivise those markets is another question entirely. In a recent Chinese government conference, China firmly stated that it would become carbon neutral by 2060 (pay attention: NET carbon emissions will be equal to 0, and not TOTAL emissions, which is quite different). I have no doubt that this will happen – the largest benefit of a single-party state is that these long-term plans can be set in stone and executed upon decades in advance, something which China has been doing since the ways of Deng. And quite obviously, there is consequently a very real threat to the heavily polluting fossil fuel-based power plants that HOLI derives a lot of its revenue from. Banning the construction of new fossil fuel plants is an obvious way to reach this target, but whether China chooses to do this or to find alternative methods of cutting net emissions is less obvious. I would like to remind you that coal consumption, which fell from 2013 to 2017, driven in part by China's willingness to significantly improve air quality, has started to rise again in more recent years as the economy suffered a severe backlash forcing the government to stimulate industrial growth.

Although the government has not released some specifics regarding how these emissions will be reduced, it is thought that this was strongly desired to allow the Communist Party to have the flexibility necessary in the short term to support the economic recovery following the pandemic. Renewables cannot as yet compete with fossil fuels in lifetime cost of operation, and building more fossil plants is a tried-and-true method of giving the economy a shot in the arm, something that any economy could do with right now.

At the same time, future constructions of railways are also uncertain. Most of the tracks laid in recent years is economically unviable, with low demand and a poor populace in these tier-3 cities laying a cap on ticket prices. However, the government views high-speed rail as a socially beneficial alternative to coaches and planes for the hundreds of millions of migrant workers that travel between large cities and the country every holiday, and thus heavily subsidises losses and encouraged more construction in the last 5-year plan. Whether continued construction in both railways and fossil fuel power plants will happen is up in the air and something that we will see in the next 5-year plan, due in March 2021.

A natural response to the threat to fossil fuel power generation automation would be to ask whether Hollysys could simply transition to automating the renewable power generation sector. My research indicates that this is not realistic. The various wind turbines, solar panels, dams, etc. they do not require a complex level of automation like that used in a refinery plan. The latter are huge power plants that occupy hundreds of square meters which require automated processes to obtain the greatest result with the least effort.

^(image from) ^(https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme801/node/4701)

While as regards the structures and machines used for renewable energy, they do not require complicate automated processes such as those used in oil and petrochemical plants; the entire process is enclosed within the turbine itself (as far as wind energy is concerned), so that it becomes almost impossible to state that these types of energy require any automation processes. In the image below I have shown you what the inside of a wind turbine looks like, which differs drastically from the previous image of the refinery plant.

📷 [https://postimg.cc/p9K2mm79](https://postimg.cc/p9K2mm79)

^(image from) ^(https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/inside-wind-turbine)

A field of application, which is very different from the one discussed above, could be to offer automation processes for the companies that produce the different solar panels, wind turbines and so on. This, however, has nothing to do with the automation processes used in oil and petrochemical businesses; here we are dealing with real industrial processes which cannot be connected to the former since they are completely different fields.

The problem is that we are not sure if Hollysys can provide such solutions and even if it is able, we do not know the time needed for this transition. One of Hollysys' strengths was its vast knowledge in the oil industry, which allowed it to keep various competitors away, but this advantage will not be reflected in the renewable sector since they have no knowledge in this field and, and from what I’ve seen, the company has not shown any interest in this sector, neither from the various conference calls held in the past nor from the annual or quarterly reports, which suggests management is either unaware of the threat or incapable of addressing it. The fact that management accounts for some fossil fuel plant automation revenue in ‘smart factories’ suggests the latter, and that they’re trying to make it look less serious than it is.

We are not saying that the company is in danger of failure, since it still has two other revenue streams to rely on, but we will certainly see a decrease in revenues (in 2019, 41% of revenues derive from automation sector, of those 41%, 40% are from oil industries) and a deterioration in the relationship with the Chinese government.

Overall, the conclusion can be drawn that if the coming 5-year plan is unfavourable to Hollysys, the company will face serious setbacks to its short and long-term prospects as the market is pricing in, while a positive 5-year plan that encourages construction of both fossil fuel plants and railways would be hugely accretive to the value of the company. My personal stance is to wait and see what the 5-year plan says – with a small-cap Chinese stock like this, the market is unlikely to immediately react and fully reprice Hollysys on positive news, allowing me a chance to get in after the future is secure even if I miss out some gains. The uncertainty regarding the possible downside to a company is something I hate, although if you have more stomach for risk and think the 5-year plan will be friendly to HOLI, you could jump in now.

If you are positive enough to jump in now you may find interesting that in my positive-scenario-model, I therefore attribute to the automation sector a CAGR of about 5% for the next 10 years, the railway sector a CAGR of 5-6% (assuming continued construction in the next 5-year plan) and attribute to the nuclear sector a CAGR of 12-15% given the enormous progress made in this particular sector in the last 10 years. The final stock price would be something between $25-30 but only if Hollysys starts to be valued with the same multiples of its peers and Chinese government postpones its good intentions to reduce their carbon impact on the rest of the world in order to sustain Chinese’s economy recovery.

Other important facts concerning the company:

* About 3 months ago the ex-CEO Baiqing Shao was changed, who has held the role for more than 7 years and was one of the founders of the company, with a member of the company's directors, Mr Colin Shang. The reasons for this decision were not entirely transparent, as the company initially stated that the CEO had left office and remained on good terms with the company, but in the latest quarterly report the company states the following:**""Dispute in connection with the ownership of Ace Lead Profits Limited ("" Ace Lead "") may adversely impact us.""** *We were made aware of a shareholder’s dispute regarding ownership of one of the principal shareholders. In August 2016, Mr. Changli Wang, the then sole shareholder of Ace Lead, one of our record shareholders, transferred his single share in Ace Lead to Mr. Baiqing Shao for a nominal consideration. As of the date hereof, Ace Lead owns 4,144,223 ordinary shares of our company, representing 6.9% of the outstanding shares of our company. We were recently notified that Mr. Wang indicated that, as Mr. Shao had stepped down as the chairman and chief executive officer of our company since July 2020, he should no longer be entitled to any share in Ace Lead and he should immediately transfer the share in Ace Lead to one or more persons designated by Mr. Wang. As of the date of this annual report, Mr. Shao has not transferred the share in ACE Lead to any designees of Mr. Wang. We cannot predict the outcome of the dispute. If Mr. Shao refuses to transfer the share in ACE Lead to a person designated by Mr. Wang, the dispute could escalate and litigation may ensue between Mr. Shao and Mr. Wang, and our company may become involved. Any escalation of this dispute, including potential litigation, may cause us to incur significant time, resources and cost if we were to become involved.*  
As easily understood this does not seem a ""friendly"" decision by the old CEO, moreover with 7% of the shares in circulation he can do much more damage to the company by attending the shareholders' meetings, being one of the shareholders with the highest participation .
* Many impairments of goodwill. The M&E refers to two companies they bought, Concord and Bond. They are based in Singapore and Malaysia. But their business spread in south east Asian and middle east. Before COVID-19, the macro-economy situation in those areas was not good, and then COVID-19 brought new challenges. Therefore, their management expects future lower profit in M&E. They also do not give guidance on the development of M&E since the company think risk control is the key focus, rather than revenue growth.
* When they got asked what they thought about Trump will to delist Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges they said that they are evaluating recent issues that may potentially affect their status as a Nasdaq-listed company and it is prudent to say that they do not exclude that option. So, no real answer was given about that, which makes me think that they do not have any plan for the near future.
* IR is slow to respond to investors. I sent two emails, the first of which was generally positive and the second follow-up which raised some of the issues discussed in this article. IR has not responded to the second for more than a month, which makes me very uncomfortable.

Also, I wanted to give you a feedback on what Hollysys has to say about this matter but investor relator has not replied to my email for more than 1 month, this gives you a clue on how bad their communication with investors is. On the other hand, I have scheduled another call with one of their competitors on 18 November to talk about what can be done for companies like these to keep up with the almost sure transition that China will experience in the following years.",54,0.85,1604156439,"[['HOLI', 4], ['IR', 3], ['DCF', 1], ['ABB', 1], ['NET', 1]]",HOLI,11.130000114440918,11.819999694824219
t3_ju2hlv,Travel Recovery writeups #3: Dufry AG,"Hiya all! I've been greatly appreciative of the words of encouragement and constructive feedback given by r/SecurityAnalysis regarding writeups on Booking Holdings ($BKNG) and Hostelworld ($HSW.L). Hopefully y'all find this to be a good read and, as always, I look forward to the good discussions and pieces of feedback in the thread. 😊

# TL;DR

As the world’s largest operator of airport duty-free stores, Dufry ($DUFRY) has suffered alongside previous businesses covered: Booking Holdings ($BKNG) and Hostelworld Group ($HSWLF). Unlike those businesses, Dufry is not a secular growth play, but a Cyclical. Suppression of its valuation caused by the costs of expansion and slowing sales growth have been compounded by a collapse in global travel. This likely forms a bottom in the cycle. An enhanced financial position; vectors enabling further Asian expansion; and recent positive vaccine news has caused a dramatic upswing. Though stretched from its fundamentals, Dufry offers significant potential upside to investors banking on a travel recovery and willing to withstand short-term volatility as gravity returns to its valuation.

# 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW

&#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Performance of Dufry AG visualised through annual revenue, operating profit, and share price performance over the past decade.

First, a short business overview. Dufry operates mainly as an airport retailer, representing 88% of 2019A revenues. This article’s focus lies here. Its decade-long “global ambition” has centred on increasing scale via acquisitions, which has boosted airport retail market share to \~20%. This [M&A push](https://www.dufry.com/en/company/our-retail-brands) continues amid current challenges; fully [acquiring](https://www.dufry.com/en/press_release/2020-08-19/dufry-plans-acquire-all-remaining-equity-interest-hudson-and-delist-hudson) American-focussed unit, Hudson ($HUD), in August 2020 – signalling confidence or ego. Beyond, management has set its sights on Asian growth, buoyed by Alibaba’s ($BABA) recent 10% stake. There is a good reason for this, as Asian travel spend only [grows in significance](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/partner-with-us/documents/global-travel-and-tourism-insights-by-visa.pdf). Here, luxury goods’ demand is expected to [double by 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/china/the-chinese-luxury-consumer). Presently, its main geographic exposure is the Americas and Europe; areas where air travel will take [longest to recover](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-07-28-02/).

# 2. OPPORTUNITY

Figure 1 shows increases in sales and profit have not been reflected in Dufry’s valuation, which is now at an \~70% discount to its highs in 2017. There are several possible explanations. Chiefly, growth in operating cashflows are being offset by financing costs incurred by their acquisition-heavy strategy. Motive for consolidation is rational, as scale means Dufry can leverage its distribution network for better pricing and synergistic cost-benefits. Yet, cost-cutting has only yielded a 1.61% gross margin improvement from 2016-2020. Shareholders have yet to meaningfully benefit from their “[global ambition\[s\]](https://www.dufry.com/en/annual-report-2019/focus-story)”. 

An additional explanation for its persistent struggles is that Dufry, like almost all of retail, has a cyclical business. I propose this was somewhat overlooked by [past bullish coverage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4186389-dufry-secular-trends-and-valuation-point-to-60-upside) on Seeking Alpha. Its cyclical nature means investors are [constantly looking ahead](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/tutorial/peter-lynchs-final-investment-checklist/). As Peter Lynch [writes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/762462.One_Up_On_Wall_Street): “timing is everything with cyclicals”. In hindsight, growth sluggishness was a sign that the ‘recovery story’ of this cyclical was over well before COVID-19 – perhaps this story now repeats itself.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Back-of-the-napkin forecast of Dufry AG. Source: Author’s calculations. ](https://preview.redd.it/5g1ccqvvo7z51.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=297cbab9d24798ceb32968e47fc9482e3443afe0)

Management expects sales to recover by 2022 and lays out three scenarios for 2020: Best (-40% YoY), Base (-55% YoY), and Worst (-70%) YoY. A 2022 recovery seems unlikely, as the [International Air Travel Association (IATA) forecasts a 2024 recovery](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-07-28-02/) in passengers. Another variable is the premium investors are willing to pay. The P/S ratio paid during the ‘uptrend’ period (2010-2014) was higher than during the ‘stagnation’ (2015-2019) and ‘downtrend’ (2019-2020) periods. Anticipation for the end of the business cycle explains these reductions in premia. Expect higher premia being paid, should a recovery be conceivable. These assumptions inform projections laid out in Figure 4.

# 3. RECOVERY RISK FACTORS

For Dufry, a recovery in its business and stock requires a revival in global air travel and travel spending. Previously highlighted, a 2024 recovery in passengers is expected by the IATA. The Americas and [Europe](https://www.consultancy.eu/news/4337/europe-needs-five-years-to-reach-pre-corona-air-travel-levels), accounting for 40% and 44% of 2019A sales, will lag on [revised forecasts](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/european-flights-waning-as-rebound-reverses-eurocontrol-says). Concurrently, a -70% change YoY in [international arrivals](https://www.unwto.org/market-intelligence#:~:text=Based%20on%20current%20trends%2C%20economic,tourist%20arrivals%20worldwide%20in%202020.) is expected. Domestic tourism has been a bright spot, but spending is [significantly higher](https://blog.accessdevelopment.com/tourism-and-travel-statistics-the-ultimate-collection) for international tourism – travel-related expenses disproportionately account towards this.

Aside from obvious uncertainties regarding the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines – and if this translates to traveller confidence – consumer strength during the ‘recovery’ phase is crucial. Fortunately, consumer confidence has held-up well in the West so far. “Pent-up demand” due to forced saving across Spring/Summer has led to [positive surprises](https://www.ft.com/content/cdfac23e-f27d-44fd-9fc2-92fe0769e77c) in economic data. This may bode well for travel spending in 2021, however, continued small-business struggles weigh on the incomes of the approximately [1 in 2 persons employed therein](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/WDN-20180627-1) as well as the possibility of further lockdowns, remain.

So far, a picture is painted of short-term pain but long-term opportunity. Yet, aside from the important and frequently quantified variables which will influence future valuations of Dufry, an esoteric question should be asked: upon reopening, what will airports look like? Airport design will no doubt radically change in the coming years. [Architecturally](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2020/06/18/the-future-of-airport-design-after-covid-19-according-to-an-airport-architect/#3150beb13919), space allotted to Check-In will decrease, as Security and Terminal become more spread out. For Dufry, omnichannel strategies will become vital. World Duty Free stores have [begun](https://airport.nridigital.com/air_aug20/seamless_travel_airport) to offer “concierge” services, where customers browse in-store and receive items delivered – where the Alibaba joint-venture is likely pivotal. It is uncertain if customers will adopt this, but such a strategy seems apt following recent [booms in domestic duty-free shopping](https://www.amtrav.com/blog/2018/04/05/domestic-duty-free-shopping-a-new-trend) as domestic travel recovers first.

# 4. FINANCIAL STRENGTH

&#x200B;

[Figure 3: Table showing financial position of Dufry, regarding payment of liabilities. Source: Author's calculations.](https://preview.redd.it/1nmpkl5fp7z51.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b380a8c1de306fde78dc2abc951ff5b5e54bcdd)

It is unsurprising that Dufry turned to the financial market for support. A [recent rights issue](https://www.dufry.com/en/press_release/2020-10-20/dufry-announces-final-number-and-offer-price-new-shares-be-issued) raised CHF 820M, with Advent International and Alibaba receiving most equity. Much of this cash will finance the CHF \~283M [Hudson acquisition](https://www.dufry.com/en/press_release/2020-08-19/dufry-plans-acquire-all-remaining-equity-interest-hudson-and-delist-hudson), with the rest there to steady the ship. Dufry’s [total liquidity](https://www.dufry.com/en/press_release/2020-11-03/continued-gradual-improvements-third-quarter-2020-dufry-successfully) now sits at CHF 2,065M. In a scenario of -70% 2020 sales, monthly operational cash burn is estimated at [CHF 60M per month](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4363958-dufry-ag-dufry-ceo-julian-diaz-on-q2-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=8). Therefore, Dufry has conceivably approximately 34 months of liquidity at the current status quo.

# 5. VALUATION

Figure 2 shows a valuation using multiples and projected sales. A more conservative DCF model is shown in Figure 4 and its assumptions in Figure 5.

[ Figure 4: Sensitivity analysis of outputs of discounted cash flow model of Dufry in a BULL scenario. PV for BASE and BEAR are CHF 32 and CHF 28, respectively. Source: Author's calculations.](https://preview.redd.it/qas3vajop7z51.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=47d4713c31f668606aed7f6001dc7647d8c10ace)

[ Figure 5: Input assumptions for Figure 2 and Figure 4. Source: Author's calculations. ](https://preview.redd.it/l0e5hk8vp7z51.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4cf4baa09decc31be5594eba614e4e7de5f2b29)

At market close on Friday 13th November 2020, Dufry is up approximately 30% this week. Encouraging COVID-19 [vaccine developments](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/pfizer-covid-vaccine-travel-companies-see-it-as-welcomed-step-.html) from Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) have spurred notion of a Travel & Tourism recovery. The swiftness of this move means there is little to gain by chasing this rally. Historically examining the speed of Dufry’s recovery in 2009, conceivably there remains significant upside (Figure 2). Yet, Figure 3 otherwise suggests that Dufry has become detached from its fundamentals and therefore presents minimal margin of safety in the short-term.

# 6. CONCLUSION

In making conclusions about a business experiencing an “[event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2urunw4EU)”, it is wise to consider what we know and what we don’t know.

**What we know**: Operationally, a persistent management team means Dufry continues to eye expanding their global presence. Asia is integral to this and Alibaba has recently acquired a 10% stake, suggesting that initial steps are being taken. Financially, its capitally intensive growth strategy coupled with the collapse in 2020 travel demand has necessitated recent capital raises by Dufry. These have significantly enhanced its liquidity, which has been used not only to shore up balance sheets but acquire smaller, struggling peers.

**What we don’t know**: Current sentiment leans toward a swift recovery in travel however it remains uncertain when passengers will be comfortable travelling again, and what form it takes. [Past articles published](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4357766-booking-holdings-disparate-risks-in-short-term-and-long-term) suggest vacation habits quickly resume after a shock but cash-strapped travellers may limit non-essential travel expenses – sadly that Lagavulin 16-year is superfluous.

Dufry as of 13th November is optimistically traded by the market. This is unsurprising; as money is made with Cyclicals during the predictable uptrend. Looking outward, a range of CHF 80-150 is representative of history however its current valuation opens Dufry up for future downside in the short-term. Still, this remains an attractive option to play a potential travel recovery.

t3_jxam5x,Investment opportunities in tech companies who adopt this go-to-market strategy,"Hi,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.

# Bottom-Up Software Sales

The ""bottom up"" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.

The premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.

For example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.

There are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.

# What's so special about bottom-up?

There are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.

&#x200B;

* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.
* **More money for R&D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  
   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....
* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.
* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.

## What to look for in a bottom-up company

Not all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

* **Look for a ""receptive"" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.
* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.
* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.
* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.
* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.

## Bottom-Up Companies

Below are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).

### Asana ($ASAN):

Asana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.

I like Asana for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.
2. **R&D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.
3. **Product & design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.
4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.

### Slack ($WORK) :

Slack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.

I like Slack for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.
2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottom-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.
3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottom-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.

### Honourable Mentions:

Below are some more bottom-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.

1. Zoom ($ZM)
2. Atlassian ($TEAM)
3. Datadog ($DDOG)
4. Zendesk ($ZEN)
5. Hubspot ($HUBS)
6. Docusign ($DOCU)

t3_jyp6xz,Short thesis on Big Lots ($BIG),"Disclaimer: I am short Big Lots. A small short position but a position nonetheless.

I was curious to what was happening with the company because they're trading at a very low P/E and I figured that this may be a value stock just off of that alone but I dug into their most recent 10-K and found some thing that turned a potential long thesis into a short thesis. Why I'm short $BIG:

\-Adjusted for buybacks, their capital base has grown faster than EPS and FCF. They need more money to return little to shareholders. They've bought back stock at aggressive paces, reducing outstanding shares by almost 50% since 2010. This move has levered the company as buybacks lower the cost of capital (to a point) but they have a lot of debt now so either they issue shares, diluting returns, or take out more debt, which is problematic in itself. More on that later. Even if you leave buybacks there and don't add them back then you still have the same exact problem. Their capital base has grown faster than EPS and FCF growth.

\-The new CEO, Bruce Thorn, recently left Mens Wearhouse and they're getting ready to leave restructuring bankruptcy. I'm not going to throw all that blame on him as that would be unfair. The various economic headwinds that Mens Wearhouse faced due to Amazon and the like aren't fair to throw onto a management team. But you have to look at who is running the company. That much can't be ignored. I'm immediately raising eyebrows if a CEO left a company and that company is in financial trouble and goes to run a new company.

\-Total debt has grown 14.88% while total asset have grown only 7.82% over the past ten years. DSI has grown from 60.34 days in 2017, bloating to 67.56 days in FY2019, to 63.16 days in FY2020. They make a lot of their sales from furniture and home decor, thins that people aren't readily buying every single day so I have to keep in mind that a high DSI may be reasonable based on what they sell. But COVID has backed up supply chains for receiving furniture to sell and DSI was rising when there was a bull market. How are they going to get bad inventory off of their books now when COVID is causing closures to their stores and their supply chains? Consignment sales? Who is going to buy it? Inventory write downs? Market won't like that. Reducing their prices? Cut their margins and the market won't like that. 

\-Last year alone selling their distribution center in CA made up 53% of EBIT last fiscal year. Pull that out and EBIT and net income saw a massive decline. This isn't the first time that selling distribution centers has made up large chunks of EBIT. You can only sell a property once so even if you're fine with them doing that to boost EBIT you still have the problem of it being a one time event. They've been entering into a lot of leaseback transactions as well that I think ultimately obscure low quality earnings and cash flow. How many more properties can they sell off to boost EBIT? They have a massive store footprint already at 1,400 stores. They're economically profitable at gross margins around 40% with little standard deviation over the past decade. They can make money in their sleep. Looking down the income statement tells you that they can't hold onto it for long because EBIT margins don't even outpace historical inflation rates.

\-Ollie's, their most direct competitor, has 12.2% EBIT margins. In their proxy statement's peer compensation section their don't see Ollie's as part of their ""peer"" market though. They seem to think they compete alongside companies like Tractor Supply (8.3%), DICK'S Sporting Goods (4.3%), Advance Auto Parts (7.0%), L Brands (7.6%), Dollar General (8.3%), and Five Below (11.8%). Look at all their EBIT margins and they still fall so short of EBIT margins against their competitors. $BIG had 2.9% EBIT margin this past year. Even if I agree with them that their peer compensation review creates an accurate market for them to compete in they still, by the list they've created, fall far away from being peers to them in this regard.

\-CA, FL, TX, and OH gave them 33% of net sales in FY2020. OH and CA just announced curfews to control COVID outbreaks and I suspect FL and TX will be forced to deal with COVID outbreaks later on in the same way. Ignoring it means more deaths and ultimately they will have to do something to curb infection rates. Big Lots aims to sell to the JCPenny demographic, the ""I want more bang for my buck/I want to feel like I'm getting a deal at your expense"" crowd. This crowd is hurting badly from unemployment rates being high and government financial support being low. What cash do they think their customers have to pay for furniture that they couldn't sell when the economy was doing good? I don't see them making those sales back soon enough to fix problems the business has. Apollo Management was aiming to take them private but the leaseback transactions that Big Lots was doing at the time of those talks made Apollo drop the idea. It seems Big Lots may be left to flounder in the public markets for a little while longer.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: This company makes money in its sleep with high gross margins but management can't seem to keep a lot of it in the business due to poor corporate governance. Aggressive buybacks over the past ten years has levered the company up at the worst time to be levered in 2020 and they've been struggling to get inventory out of their stores in good times, let alone during bad times.

t3_k0fjiq,Oil is probably a value play (finally),"I think we're finally at the point where oil is in firm value territory now and wanted to lay the macro environment out for others. There were a couple false starts between 2015 and now, but the risk is now weighted to the upside, in my opinion.

Let's be clear, oil E&Ps are ultimately a bet on the oil price with few exceptions, so essentially everyone should stay far far away unless you have some serious conviction in your oil price call which I do not recommend. The exception, in my mind, are royalty companies. Royalties are great businesses. They don't have the torque of oil companies but they're legitimate businesses that make money regularly. If you want to have some exposure to the sector, which much less risk and volatility, this is where it is. Nearly every company in the royalty sector appears very cheap with FCF yields ranging from 8-15% on low oil price decks. These are the types of businesses that should trade at low yields (probably not above 8%) because of the certainty of cash flow and much lower liquidity risk.

Back to oil. To set the stage, I think some basics around where oil demand and supply are at. Pre-pandemic oil demand was around 100 mmbbl/d and you'd see large swings in oil prices when the market was 1 mmbbl/d+ over/undersupplied. Pre-pandemic OPEC was essentially holding oil rangebound in the $50-60 range with some small deviations outside of that. The pandemic absolutely demolished oil demand which is why we saw oil go negative (20-30 mmbbl/d of demand destroyed at its peak). Now, I can't say for sure where we are on the demand side, but currently India and China are at demand levels **above** where they were pre-pandemic. The major volumes that need to return to the market relate to flying and to a lesser extent from driving. My guess is we're likely somewhere between 90-95 mmbbl/d in oil demand right now, I don't think the specifics really matter because the main thing that matters is where we are on the other side of COVID. Demand is almost certain to come within 3% of pre-pandemic levels, with 3% being my low case and above pre-pandemic levels being the high case (baked in are assumptions of an initial demand burst of flying, as well as some structural changes to people using less transit). Now, returning to pre-pandemic levels, or within 3% of pre-pandemic volumes doesn't sound very bullish until you look at the supply side.

Oil supply has been also been hit pretty hard on a relative basis. It might not sound like much, but oil supply has likely decreased somewhere in the range of 4-6 mmbbl/d due to COVID. US volumes alone are 2-3 mmbbl/d below where they were pre-pandemic due to shale's massive decline rates and shut-ins which will never return. There's at least another 1 mmbbl/d of supply offline from other shut-ins that will never return, and this still doesn't account for the declines of other oilfields which have seen limited drilling since March. The US rig count is at \~300 right now, which is ridiculously low (800 pre-pandemic) meaning you shouldn't be expect a massive inflow from shale anytime soon.

Where does that leave us? We will likely be at 97 mmbbl/d of oil demand (on my low case for demand) vs 96 mmbbl/d of oil supply (on my high case for supply). That means we will not be at $40-45 WTI for very long once vaccine rollouts start positively impacting global travel and work patterns. I think we will see some stops and starts in the meantime due to second waves of COVID having some demand impacts and OPEC rolling off curtailments earlier than expected if the supply/demand picture improves. We also have the lack of capital available to oil companies underpinning the supply picture. US companies were starting to struggle pre-pandemic as well costs and the uneconomic nature of the marginal barrel of shale at $55/bbl finally caught up. COVID has completely destroyed the sector and every investor still hates the sector because of it. Ramping up production will not start happening until we see $55 WTI at the earliest, in my opinion. No one will be willing to lend/provide much equity until that point because the past 5 years oil has only burned investors. Additional regulations on US shale from the Biden admin also provides some minor tailwinds, but I think this won't be nearly as material as the inherent supply/demand mismatch we will see.

Risks:

\- Iran production coming back online. It's hard to say how much more Iran production could come back online if sanctions were lifted by the US. It's likely in the 1.5-2.0 mmbbl/d range which could provide some headwinds, but I don't think it keeps oil from going to $55.

\- Vaccine rollouts are slower than expected. The longer travel demand remains suppressed, the longer oil prices will linger.

\- Another OPEC price war/reducing curtailments. I think initial impacts from OPEC rolling off sanctions will overstate the impact because I don't think the spare capacity will be enough to cover the demand shortfall. This is a pretty big unknown because it's hard to put a specific number on this at this point.

Curious to hear other thoughts - but I think oil has largely been left for dead, evidenced by the European majors essentially abandoning oil and using oil price decks that make very few projects economic.

**TL;DR:** COVID-19 has thrown oil demand/supply balance out of whack, doesn't seem like anyone cares because everyone hates the sector due to the past 5 years.

Disclaimer: Please don't take this as any sort of investment advice. It's not. Don't invest in oil unless you want to (probably) lose money.",22,0.77,1606257646,"[['WTI', 2], ['FCF', 1]]",WTI,2.0999999046325684,2.200000047683716

t3_k5uelu,Deepmind has deep value for Alphabet?,"I do not want to get too detailed with this post about the importance and value of AI, but I wanted to start a discussion about what is a truly an incredible advancement in AI and the implication on the fourth largest company in the world.  This week, Deepmind from alphabet reported an incredible advancement in the ability to predict folded protein structure from primary sequence.  

See the following for details about the advancement: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4)

In terms of difficulty, the objective of predicting the fold of a protein is  one of the great challenges in science. It is something a number of the best scientists in academia have been trying to achieve. As a scientist who works on protein engineering/structural biology, I cannot believe the ease and level of accuracy with which they are able to do this.  I did not think something like this could be achieved for decades, let alone a couple years after Deepmind decided to apply their technology to it.

I do not think this advancement itself has much commercial value relative to the size of Alphabet (it could bring in a couple million a year via pharma licensing), but by pulling this achievement off, along with their many other fundamental successes, it seems clear to me that Deepmind is the world's leader in AI (rivaled only by openAI).   What is that worth to a company that already has the most access to data for both search (-->smarter ads),  and maps (-->self driving cars)?  How many of their currently unprofitable subsidiaries (e.g. verily, Waymo) are ready to drive value over the next 5-10?  

So I wrote this post not because I understand the implications on Alphabet, but because I'm curious what the rest of you think, especially those of you who actively track the tech sector (I am personally more focused on biotech).",105,1.0,1606989281,"[['AI', 2]]",AI,90.02999877929688,131.74600219726562

Hello, welcome to my first deep dive write up.

My  name’s Mark and I’m an accountant with a passion for investing. About  two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm  and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and  privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique  perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a  new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to  help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market  today.

I’m a long-term investor. I  am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time.  I’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book  “100 Baggers” by Chris Mayer.

**Introduction**

I  think it’s fitting that my first stock pick has to do with sports.  Sports has been a part of my life since I could walk at the age of 2.  First with baseball and soccer, and then later in my childhood with  golf. I’ve always played American football and basketball for fun as  well and have always been an avid fan of all the major sports in the US.

I  started playing fantasy sports (mostly just fantasy football) about 6  years ago and have always enjoyed it. Traditionally, with fantasy  football you draft a team at the beginning of the year and those are  your players for the rest of the season. If you have a bad draft, oh  well. You can try to improve your team with trades and free agent  additions but it is tough. Leagues usually consist of 10-14 teams (each  managed by an individual) and there’s obviously only one winner at the  end of the season (about 4 months after the draft). This can lead to the  managers of the lower performing teams losing interest as the season  wanes on. I believe DraftKings’ (DK) founders saw this issue and saw an  opportunity. Enter, daily fantasy sports. Now, with the DK platform you  can draft a new team every week. Or if you want, every day. This allows  fans of fantasy sports to engage at whichever point of the season they  want and at varying financial stakes.

**The Thesis Statement**

For  every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement  that can serve as a reminder for why I’m buying and holding that stock  for the long term. I’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long  so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why  you’re holding this position.

The thesis statement I have come up with for DK is as follows:

*“DraftKings:  The leader in allowing fans to engage financially with their favorite  sports, teams, and players. Having money at stake makes the game a lot  more interesting to watch. The era of daily fantasy sports games, online  sports betting, and online betting (outside of sports), is just getting  started and DK is as well positioned (or better positioned) than anyone  to capitalize off of this trend.”*

Notice  how I said “allowing fans to engage financially” as the first sentence  and not necessarily “allowing fans to gamble”. There’s a reason for  that. According to US Federal Law, Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) contests  have specifically been exempted from the prohibitions of the Unlawful  Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). DK has always been, and I  believe will continue to be DFS contests 1st, sports betting 2nd, and  other forms of gambling/entertainment 3rd.  It is noteworthy that states  at an individual level can still deem DFS contests illegal if they so  wish, but as of this writing (11/26/20), 43 of the 50 US States allow  DFS contests and DK, accordingly, is offering DFS contests in all 43 of  those US States.

I’ll try to clarify the difference between DFS contests and sports betting real quick:

**DFS Contest –**  Pay a pre-set entry fee to enter a contest. All entry fees go towards  “The Pot”. “Draft” 9 players to be on your “Team” for 1 week. Enter your  “Roster” into a contest with other players (could range from 1 other  person to 1,000s of people, the DK user can choose). Whichever “Roster”  amasses the most points for that week out of all contestants wins. The  winner will get the highest payout, and depending on the nature of the  contest, other top finishers will receive smaller payouts as well.

**Sports Gambling –**  Team A is considered a 10 point favorite to defeat Team B. This means  that Team A is expected, by the professional gambling line setters, to  outscore Team B by 10 points. This is known as a point spread. You can  bet on the underdog or the favorite. If you bet on the favorite, they  have to win by more than 10 points for you to win the bet. If you bet on  the underdog, you will win the bet as long as the underdog keeps the  game within less than a 10 point defeat.

These  are just a couple simple examples to help you see the difference.  Sports Gambling (the 2nd priority of DK) is a very lucrative market just  as the DFS contests are. However, in the US, Federal Laws and  regulations are a lot stricter on Sports Gambling than they are on DFS.  As of this writing (11/27/20), 22 states (including the District of  Columbia) out of 51 possible allow sports gambling.

DK  is still in the infancy stages of getting their sports gambling  business going. In the 22 states where they could potentially operate,  they currently have a sports gambling offering in 11 of those states.  The sports gambling business model for DK can be broken into two main  offerings – mobile sports betting, and retail sports betting. Mobile  sports betting means you can place a sports bet online from the comfort  of your own home, while retail sports betting means you must go to a  casino and place a bet with the sportsbook in person. I personally  believe mobile sports betting is the real potential cash cow for DK out  of the two types of sports betting offerings due to the convenience and  ease of access. DK is currently working on and encouraging customers to  lobby their state lawmakers to legalize sports gambling in more states.

**How DK makes money**

At  the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand  how they make money. In Chris Mayers’ excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn’t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I  look at.

For DK, their means of  making money is quite simple. I already went into detail above about DFS  Contests and Sports Gambling. In DK’s latest 10-Q filing with the SEC  (filed 11/13/20), revenue is broken out into two main streams: Online  Gaming and Gaming Software.

**Online Gaming (82% of Total Revenue for 9 months ended 9/30/20):**

Online  gaming is the true core business of DK and includes the aforementioned  DFS Contests, Sports Gambling and additional gambling (non-sports)  opportunities. DK refers to their additional gambling (non-sports) as  “iGaming” or “online casino”.

For  the 9 months ended 9/30/20, Online Gaming revenue totaled $239M, up 30%  YoY from $184M in the same prior year period. Keep in mind, that this is  an increase that happened during a COVID-19 global pandemic that  delayed and shortened many professional sports seasons.

Online  gaming revenue is earned in a few ways that are slightly different, but  very similar overall.  In order to enter a DFS contest, a customer must  pay an entry fee. DFS revenue is generated from these entry fees  collected, net of prize payouts and customer incentives awarded to  users. In order to place a sports bet (sports gambling), a customer  places a wager with a DK Sportsbook. The DK Sportsbook sets odds for  each wager that builds in a theoretical margin allowing DK to profit.  Sports gambling revenue is generated from wagers collected from  customers, net of payouts and incentives awarded to winning customers.  The last form of online gaming revenue is earned in similar fashion to a  land-based casino, offering online versions of casino games such as  blackjack, roulette, and slot machines.

**Gaming Software (18% of Total Revenue for 9 months ended 9/30/20):**

While  the Online Gaming revenue stream mentioned above is a Business to  Consumer (B2C) model, the Gaming Software revenue stream is a Business  to Business (B2B) model. The Gaming Software side of the business was  born out of the acquisition of SBTech, a company from the Isle of Man  (near the UK) founded in 2007 that has 12+ years of experience providing  online sports betting platforms to clients all over the world. The  acquisition occurred as part of the SPAC driven IPO in April of 2020  that combined “the old DK company” with SBTech so that they now are “the  new DK company” listed as DKNG on the NASDAQ. SBTech is a far more  important part of the story than just being 18% of today’s revenue. The  reason for this is because DK will eventually (planned mid-late 2021) be  migrating all of their DFS and gambling offerings onto SBTech’s online  platforms. Currently, for DFS, DK uses their own proprietary platform  but that will move to SBTech with the migration. Currently, for online  gambling, DK uses Kambi, the same online gambling platform that services  Penn Gaming (PENN), a DK rival. But that’s enough about the software  migration for now, back to the Gaming Software revenue.

The  Gaming Software revenue stream for DK is essentially a continuation of  SBTechs’ B2B business model. DK contracts with business customers to  provide sports and casino betting software solutions. DK typically  enters two different type of arrangements with B2B customers when  selling the gaming software:

1. **Direct Customer Contract Revenue:**  In this type of transaction, the software is sold      directly to a  business (casino for example) that wants to use the software      for  their own gambling operations. This revenue is generally calculated as       a percentage of the wagering revenue generated by the business  customer      using DK’s software and is recognized in the periods in  which those      wagering and related activities conclude.
2. **Reseller Arrangement Revenue:**   In this type of transaction, DK provides      distributors with the  right to resell DK’s software-as-a-service offering      to their  clients, using their own infrastructure. In reseller      arrangements,  revenue is generally calculated via a fixed monthly fee and      an  additional monthly fee which varies based on the number of gaming  operators      to whom each reseller sub-licenses DK’s software.

As  mentioned above, SBTech was an international company based in the Isle  of Man before being acquired by DK. Thus, the majority of their business  in their first 12 years of operating independently has always been  international and outside of the United States. This has helped DK,  which has historically been US focused, expand it’s international reach.

A  perfect example of expanding this international reach occurred recently  during October (technically Q4) in which DK’s B2B technology (powered  by SBTech) helped enable the launch of “PalaceBet”, a new mobile and  online sportsbook offering from Peermont, a South Africa based resort  and casino company. The deal was headed by DK’s new Chief International  Officer, Shay Berka, who previously spent 10 years working for SBTech as  CFO and General Manager. Mr. Berka took on the role of DK’s Chief  International Officer upon the merger in April earlier this year. I  think this deal shows that DK has integrated SBTech and it’s business  very well into the larger business as a whole. They are not wasting any  time using their newly acquired resources to expand their reach and  bring in new sources of revenue.

This  is the end of my first article about DK. My goal is to drop Part 2  later this week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the  question – “Can we 10x from here?”

3. Is there any way to estimate how long they occur for? Do they eventually turn from sellers who add liquidity, or what?

4. Do options traders influence this? Let's say folks buy call options, and it send the price of a call option higher, wouldn't that allow for firms to step in and created a synthetic call?

Disclaimer: I am long this company.  I generally pay up for high-quality compounders with a long runway. While this investment doesn't fit those characteristics of quality, I was driven to the compelling valuation. This is a minor (~5%) position in what is a concentrated (~6-7 company) portfolio.

**Elevator Pitch**

With the S&P 500 trading at a 37x P/E ratio I've been searching for good businesses with low expectations baked in despite modest growth. With a 50%+ ROIC, steady ~12% annual revenue/profit growth, at a ~4x EV/EBITDA multiple, Wayside Technology (WSTG) seems to fit the bill. **A slight re-rating to 5x EBITDA with 15% growth through 2023 would result in 96.5m EV, or 120m market cap (56% upside).**


&nbsp;


**The Business**

Please see this infographic for a concise overview of the company's value proposition. https://i.imgur.com/AgfGMT9.jpg

**Overview:** WSTG is a middleman between emerging software products and large established IT distributors (think CDW). Software start ups often lack the know-how, network, and managerial resources to effectively market to their target market. Established IT distributors struggle with vetting/appropriately matching an overwhelming number of software products to sell into their channels. WSTG transacts in the middle of these two parties, distributing to 4,000+ partners via 100+ vendor relationships. My first thought is skepticism around this company's value proposition, but their track record of steady growth and long-standing relationship with giants such as CDW suggest resiliency against disintermediation. I also believe the business has been so durable due to the sheer size and continued growth of the industry. 

**New Management:** Falling margins, meager profit growth, and deteriorating ROICs tainted WSTG's financial picture under the helm of prior CEO Simon Nynens. Dale Foster became WSTG's CEO in January 2020, preceding the unlocking of cash from working capital to deploy on acquisitions, as well as the beginnings of a margin inflection. In addition to the unlocking of that cash, in 2020 WSTG has made its two largest acquisitions in its history. Prior to WSTG, Foster ran a nearly identical business, growing its sales from 40m in 1997 to 550 million in 2017.


&nbsp;


**Financials**

**Cash Flow/EBITDA:** 38M LTM FCF. However, the massive spike  is due to an improved receivables arrangement with one of their vendors, so it is by no means an accurate proxy for the strength of the business. TTM EBITDA in June is 12.7m. (4.8m net income + 1.8m taxes, +.5 D&A, +.8 stock comp, +1.9 legal, +.6 acquisition cost, +2 CDF Group EBITDA).

**ROIC:** What attracted me to this business in the first place is its ROIC. Ex-cash (including cash in ROIC here makes zero sense to me), they're at barely negative working capital. With ~3m in fixed assets and ~7m in intangibles, the business earns in excess of 50% in cash on capital deployed in the business, depending on the run-rate cash flow number you arrive at. Analyzing historical cash from investing reaffirms this point - it has barely exceeded 1m in any of the last 10 years, while the business produced ample albeit lumpy cash from operations. Bottom-line, it's ultimately a cash cow requiring next to zero reinvestment.

**Cashflow Growth Story:** Analyzing revenue growth can be deceptive, as accounting changes resulted in a ~60% yoy decline in revenue in 2016. Adjusting for the accounting change, annual sales (gross billings) have steadily grown from 206m in 2010 to ~650m in current LTM, a healthy ~12% annual growth rate.

The industry grows at ~10% / year. WSTG's market share in North America has climbed from .15% in 2006 to .18% in 2019. Thus, there is the case to be made for a long runway in terms of both organic and acquisitive growth.
 
With regards to the cost structure, EBITDA margin has begun to inflect upwards over the last year, suggesting some operating leverage has yet to be realized. 


&nbsp;


**Valuation** 

At $17.76 a share the market capitalization is 77.48m. With 22.9m (40.3m-17.4m for subsequent acquisition) cash on hand and 0 debt that suggests a 54.58m enterprise value. With ~12.7m in estimated run-rate EBITDA (barring any growth), you're looking at a 4.3x EV / EBITDA multiple. What's more - due to such little re-investment requirements, I believe the company will be able to just stack cash on its balance sheet- or more opportunistically - shore up EBITDA growth with bolt-on acquisitions. On that note, the company has just announced the acquisition of CDF Group Limited for $17.4m, the largest acquisition in the company's history. CDF Group earned 2m EBITDA LTM, but was acquired due to supposed cross-selling/synergistic potential. 

Ex-acquisitions I conservatively estimate 10% EBITDA growth per year. On the more bullish end, the business plowing cash into further acquisitions and an inflection in margin offer further growth upside.  That said, I believe it is feasible the company is able to achieve 15-20% EBITDA growth through 2023. I don't forsee further multiple compression, so there is only upside there IMO. All-in-all, a slight rerating to 5x EBITDA with 15% growth through 2023 would result in 96.5m EV, or 120m market cap (56% upside) assuming they maintain current cash position. I wouldn't be surprised at an even more generous re-rating given these numbers play into fruition and the market wakes up to what is a compelling growth story.

I don't like lack of insider ownership

Small microcaps are inherently risky, law of small numbers, loss of customer/contracts. CDW represents ~26% of WSTG's sales, top 5 represent approximately 55%.

t3_kevaxu,Google - The Bear Case,"**Summary**

Ad revenue growth is slowing down and I expect this trend to continue.

That's Google’s core business, which means the company will be forced to explore other avenues to maintain growth.

Cloud, Youtube, and Waymo will provide some future growth. But will it be enough?


**Thesis**


Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL) has been an outstanding company and investment for the better part of 20 years. Its search engine is unparalleled and there is little chance of it getting displaced any time soon. Nonetheless, its main source of revenue; search engine ad spending is beginning to taper off. With stiff competition, there is an inherent risk in Google which many investors may not be factoring into their analysis. Below we develop the bear case for Google.

**Google's core Business**


There's probably not an adult human in the world that doesn't know and understand how Google makes money. It's all about the ads. When searching for anything on the internet, you are going to use google and in most cases, you will be looking at the first few results on the first page. The importance of featuring high up on a google search has turned SEO and SEM into a billion-dollar business in and of itself. But there's a much easier way to guarantee a top spot and that is paying Google, and it doesn't stop there. Google also has ads all over the web in the form of ""banners"" and the like, and because it knows what you are searching, it knows which ads to show you.

There's no doubt that Google ads are effective but is there a limit to how much Advertising we can tolerate? More importantly, is there a limit to how much businesses can spend on google ads?

There is a defined trend that is also supported by intuition and real-life evidence. First off, it is clear that the effectiveness of search ads and banner ads is decreasing. People are becoming increasingly aware of them and avoiding them, either unconsciously or actively through adblockers. On top of adblockers, businesses that use these forms of ads based on clicks or impressions also face the risk of fraud through bots and other ""hacks"". Lastly, it is obvious that the most popular forms of advertising now is coming from influencers and other types of affiliate marketing. Google Ads can only go so far, and nowadays consumers are demanding a more personalized and ""immersive"" advertising experience.

**Where's the growth?**


Google is actively pursuing other avenues to replace its falling ad revenue growth. In this section, I'd like to cover some of the most significant growth initiatives that the company is pursuing. These include Google Cloud, Youtube, and Waymo.

*Google Cloud*

It's all about the cloud these days, and Google has undoubtedly taken a piece of the pie. After Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft, Corp. (MSFT), Google is the largest cloud provider in the world. We cannot deny that Google Cloud has actually been outgrowing its competitors, managing to gain market share. But with the segment still, as far as I see, there are no qualitative advantages to Google's cloud offerings as of right now. Google Cloud cannot compete in size with AWS and Microsoft's Azure has the dominant position in terms of quality and public cloud. I am bullish on Microsoft's Azure and believe that it may become the dominant Cloud provider in the next few years. However, I cannot see Google taking much market share from Amazon or Microsoft, which means cloud revenues will also taper off. Even if cloud continued to grow at double digits it would still take a few years at the very least for it to even come close to representing a significant amount of Google's revenues. While Google is doing the right thing and will benefit from the cloud, they have too little market share and were too late in entering the market.

*Youtube*

Another holy grail of growth is that of Youtube and Youtube TV. Granted, once again, we have seen significant growth in revenues in the last year, but there are some inherent problems with Youtube as a whole. Firstly, as is already stated in the Annual Report, cost-per-clicks remain low. On top of that, the platform as a whole is facing an exodus of creators as percentages of revenue split for creators have been decreasing substantially. Of course, the platform remains a great way to gain traction as a content creator, but anyone seriously contemplating it as a business or job will have strong incentives to move viewers to their site or platform. For users as well, back in the day YouTube’s primary benefit was the fact that it was ad-free, and with ads now playing even during videos, the platform has no real edge other than its scale.

Lastly, I'd like to mention Youtube TV, which is included under ""Other"" in Google's reports together with revenues from Google Play. Just recently, Youtube decided to raise the price of Youtube TV by 30%. What Google is doing with Youtube TV is symptomatic of what is arguably happening with the whole business. Google used to offer superior and free products, and now that it has the size and trust of its clients, it is squeezing them as much as possible. Fair play to them, making money should be a priority, but there is only so much that people will allow or endure. After all, what does Youtube offer that can't already be found on cable or Netflix?

*Waymo*

Although autonomous driving still feels like it belongs in sci-fi movies, we know that behind the scenes, many companies are working tirelessly to deliver a technology that will save millions of dollars and lives. And here Google has a chance to be perhaps the first company to start commercializing autonomous vehicles. With Waymo already offering this service to a select user base, we could see a larger scale launch take place as early as 2021. But even if Waymo succeeds, it might still fall short. Michael McGrath estimates that Waymo could earn Google up to $40 billion by 2025. That's about 25% of Google's revenues today. Furthermore, he estimates that by 2030 the ARS market could grow to up to $700 billion, of which google could have anywhere from 20-30% market share. Indeed, if this is the case, investing in Google makes much more sense. But we must bear in mind Google also faces very hard competition, especially in my opinion from Tesla Inc (TSLA). Elon Musk has recently claimed to be on the verge of achieving level 5 autonomous driving. Of course, the CEO of Tesla is known for being overly optimistic about timelines, but there is a real chance here that Tesla could beat out Waymo.

**Valuation**

Over the last decade, Google has consistently achieved a >20% revenue CAGR year after year, which is what investors have come to expect. But with its main source of revenue being ads, what if Google only delivers good growth instead of amazing growth in the next 20 years? The point is that Google will have to reinvent itself to maintain growth rates high and investors happy. Don't get me wrong. I am simply trying to point out that, given Google's current business model, it will have to adapt to continue to be a top company as it is today. Waymo could be the thing that does this for Google, as an example along with its Other Bets, so this is where I will be looking. But in the meantime, don't be surprised if growth begins to dwindle.",8,0.67,1608202187,"[['GOOG', 3], ['TV', 2], ['SEM', 1]]",GOOG,1738.6600341796875,1746.0
t3_kfdyur,A brief long thesis to a deep value idea,"Hi guys, did a brief analysis on an interesting idea (orphaned stock) that I found in the HK stock market. Would love any feedback and am open to other considerations. This was my VIC application piece. Thankss! 


If you are only interested in the main thesis and the numbers, please scroll down to the investment thesis section. 

Business Background
Lvji Technology (驴迹科技) is China's largest online tour guide provider an 86.2% market share in the online tour guide service market, a 0.4% market share of the overall tour guide service market, and a 0.02% market share of the online tourism market in terms of GMV in 2018. Lvji has created a blue ocean, the online tour guide industry, and is spearheading the disruption of the traditional tour guide market. With the entire travel industry in China grinding to a halt in H1 2020, smaller competitors do not have the balance sheet and operational flexibility to survive. This environment is beneficial for Lvji in the long term as it is able to take up greater market share and roll out new synergistic initiatives.

Lvji deploys software on Alibaba Cloud to provide online tour guides with proprietary contents. These contents include illustrated maps of tourists attractions, editorial contents, voice-over commentaries of points of interest. There is a full list of patents and copyrights associated with these contents at the bottom of Lvji's IPO prospectus. These features are aggregated and implemented to include other function such as real-time navigation. For instance, a user who is exploring the Great Wall of China will experience real-time voice-over commentaries depending on the location of the user. 

Lvji generates a substantial portion of their revenue from the sales of online tour guides through Online Travel Agencies (OTA), such as Meituan, Ctrip, Quniu, etc. The relationship between Lvji and these OTAs allows Lvji to rapidly grow its customer base with little to no marketing spend. The typical cut these OTAs are entitled to be approximately 40-50% of the price of the map. Lvji managed to enter and maintain two exclusive agreements with the two of the top 5 OTAs that they work with. The two OTAs enjoy a higher cut of 50%. It is useful to note that prices of their online tour guides sold through OTAs range from approximately RMB3.9 to RMB7.4 (USD0.6 - USD1.13). With prices that are already extremely low and creates so much value for the consumer, it is extremely undesirable and foolish for a competitor to enter the market and potentially start a price war. This also provides Lvji with the optionality to increase the price of its online tour guides as they roll out new features to enhance the experience. 

Lvji also generates an extremely small portion of the revenue from traditional agencies, where these agencies buy a fixed number of online tour guides with activation codes from Lvji at a fixed price. Lvji has its own APP that is currently not widely used, and hence, also only represent a minuscule portion of its total revenue. 

I am inclined to completely discount these two areas of the business as the success of its APP is highly dependent on the execution ability of its management team. This will naturally require a lot of marketing expense and resources that may distract Lvji from dominating the industry. Besides, I'm not sure if we can trust the 5* reviews on Lvji's APP.

Outside of the sale of online tour guide, Lvji provides services for customized content to administrators of tourist attractions and local government offices. Lvji creates proprietary online tour guide contents for tourist attractions in a form of an independent APP or mini-program commissioned by the administrators of the tourist attractions, and charge one-time service fees. These guides may include AI commentaries, automatic positioning, and other additional functions. While the revenue from content customization is still currently insignificant, it is clear that the management intends to develop this area. 

From the latest 2020 interim report, Lvji has mentioned that they are actively seeking new synergistic initiatives to create value for attraction administrators. I believe that the success or failure of any industry within China is heavily influenced by the government's policies. While this may also be the case for many countries with varying degree, the impact is extremely apparent within China. It is clear that China has set the directive to digitalize the tourism industry, with tourism being one of the key pillars of China's strategic industries. This trend has also been accelerated due to COVID. A quick relevant google search should land you a few informative articles.

Suppliers. OTAs are categorized as suppliers as their concession fees are recognized as their cost of sales from an accounting perspective. However, they are not actually Lvji's suppliers in its supply chain. OTAs provide the platform for Lvji to reach out to millions of travellers within China. To fuel Lvji's high growth for the past 2 to 3 years, Lvji resorted to outsourcing the raw content and data collection from third parties before aggregating these content as part of their own. This scalable business model reduces the need for excessive manpower for routine work. 

Industry Dynamics and Lvji's role
Lvji has commissioned Frost & Sullivan, independent market research and consultant, to report on the online tourism industry and online tour guide service industry in China. I note the obvious agency problem here and Frost & Sullivan may be inclined to be biased towards the future of the industry but I would still like to highlight a few data points and colour they provided. I will be largely ignoring their expectations of the growth rates over the next few years as I do not understand the fundamental backing behind those numbers, albeit seemingly conservative. Feel free to have a look and comment if you agree or disagree with their forecasts.

General macro tailwinds. Rising per capita disposable income and strong demand for tourism have been driving the growth of the tourism market in China, where the offline tourism market experienced a CAGR of 9.1% and online with 32.5% per annum from 2014 to 2018. I would like to point out that it may be interesting to note that while the industry as a whole is still growing very quickly, the divergence in growth rates highlights a telling underlying trend. The Chinese are transiting from an offline economy to an online one very rapidly. For the better or worse, the Chinese are typically more open to the prompting of the government - from picking up contactless payments to product preferences, and now, the tour experience. As more of the youth rapidly represent a larger proportion of tourists, unlike the older generations, they prefer greater autonomy and independence in their travelling experience. Lvji matches their needs by remotely providing in-depth attraction information that they could otherwise only enjoy under a traditional tour guide's lead. We can only imagine how much more economically feasible to go with the remote option as well. Locals at the entrance of a tourist attraction may charge up to RMB600 - RMB700 for a personally guided tour. Well, one can argue that there is value in the personal touch but is the touch worth RMB600 - RMB8 (the price of map)= RMB592? I am not too sure but some may even view the added personal touch as a reduction of value instead. 

Online Tourism Agency market. The OTA industry is neither extremely concentrated nor highly fragmented. The top five OTAs accounted for 82.0% of China's online tourism market in terms of GMV in 2018 but there are hundreds of smaller players, possible with their own niche. A few of the larger players are Meituan, Ctrip, Qunar, and Alibaba's Fliggy. The OTA industry, however, is extremely competitive. There are numerous internet giants in China that are always interested in grabbing a piece of the pie wherever they go. Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu are the giants partially behind the digital transformation of many industries, from e-commerce to ride-sharing, to food-delivery, and travel. This dynamics may explain why the OTAs are willing to rapidly adopt Lvji's products as part of their platform. If an OTA observes that one of its competitors have a new and superior feature, it is necessary to get on board quickly. 

Number of tourist attractions. There are more than 31,692 tourist attractions within China and Lvji has covered 22,044 tourist attractions, comprising of close to 100% of all A grade tourist attractions. It is curious to note that the value of their product and service becomes very apparent for lower grade tourist attractions that are typically less covered by traditional tour guides. I believe that this is likely to be an eventually winner-takes-all market where it is a lot more convenient and consistent to use a product from a large company that has wide attraction coverage for different attractions than to use different products from different providers with varying quality and features. 

Tour guide service market in China. Tour guide can be mainly divided into online tour guide, audio guide, and personal tour guide. The total revenue of the tour guide service market has increased from approximately RMB38.5B in 2014 to approximately RMB66.7B in 2018, a CAGR of approximately 14.8%. The online tour guide market contributed only 0.0007% and 0.5% of the overall tour guide service market in 2015 and 2018 respectively. I do believe that while there is still value in having a personal tour guide for some tourists, Lvji's online tour guide if implemented properly, should naturally replace the need for audio guides and a substantial proportion of personal tour guides. 

Dennis Hong of ShawSpring Partners mentioned how SEA has a subtle but extremely valuable real estate that is embedded in each of its loyal users' phone - the Shopee APP. The customer may or may not purchase anything on the first few usages of the APP, but when the user has any intention of purchase, there is a strong likelihood of turning to the APP if the user likes the user experience. While Lvji has an extremely long way to develop its own APP, existing users of their product via OTAs should recognize the incremental value Lvji brings compared to using traditional options. 

Online tour guide market. Strong government policies, increasing internet penetration rate, and the preference for self-guided and in-depth tourism experience has led to impressive growth in the online tour guide service market. The market experienced a CAGR of 942.6% from RMB0.3M in 2015 to RMB340.0M in 2018. Do note that this only represents 0.5% of the overall tour guide service market. There is no reason why this percentage shouldn't grow over time. 

Government Support. 
'According to the “13th Five-Year Tourism Development Plan” 《“十三五”旅遊業發展規劃》 issued by the State Council, China will further improve the tourism market as tourism becomes one of the pillars of China’s strategic industries. Innovation in the tourism industry is expected to provide people with high-quality and specialized choices which provide new types of tourist attractions as well as the potential market for online tour guide service. In addition, information infrastructure development is also expected to be improved and strengthened, including comprehensive coverage of free Wi-Fi, online tour guide, electronic interpreter, online booking, and push notification of tourist attractions information above category AAAA by 2020, which encourages the development of online tour guide service market nationwide in the near future.' - Lvji IPO Prospectus
Lvji has already been working with many tourist attraction and government administrators to provide the infrastructure for smart tourism. While I cannot precisely quantify or evaluate how much of a tailwind this provides, it is comforting to know that Lvji is swimming with the policy current. 

Strategic direction and capital allocation
In the latest interim report, they stated they plan to use AR and AI technologies to build a digital marketing platform centred on ticket sales of tourist destinations, and integrate the ticketing, management, marketing, and promotion of tourist destinations with the surrounding amenities (shopping, etc.). They intend to integrate other features that seem like buzzwords to me. I cannot evaluate what exactly they are doing here even though they seem to be doing quite a bit. 

They also mentioned that they are actively watching for M&A opportunities to grow/ enhance their core operations. This may have been the motivating force behind the PIPE deal that was recently passed.

On 12 October 2020, Lvji had a PIPE deal that is worth HK$47.9M issued to three strategic subscribers. 'The net proceeds are intended to be used for (1) operating expenses such as hiring additional employees and procuring advanced hardware and software equipment to increase the Group's productivity; and (2) equity acquisition and investment of high-quality enterprises associated with the Company's business. '


Management
Mr. Zang Weizhong is a 12-year China Mobile executive before he embarked on this start-up. Mr. Zang currently directly owns 399M shares, representing 28% of all shares outstanding. He has purchased 746,000 shares from the open market at 0.89.

I have read through a few transcripts of Mr. Zang's interview and it seems like he has his eyes set on the long-term. You can take a look at a few (and google translate) here:
https://news.futunn.com/stock/11154810?src=3
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1633774813058503210&wfr=spider&for=pc

'整个团队在臧总的带领下，更倾向于用“藏锋于钝，养辩于讷”的战术稳步发展；在智慧旅游行业占据更多市场份额、开拓更多营销渠道，他坚信智慧旅游游中场景是继在线旅游行业后的又一风口！游中场景的蓝海市场尚处于“社会主义初级阶段”，大量“游中新物种”尚未被发现，“藏锋于鞘”的战术是目前的最佳路径。'

Here, Mr. Zang talks about how Lvji seeks to be mediocre on the surface but brilliant in its core. Charismatic leaders like Jack Welsch tend to have the most attention and praise. They are usually in the limelight and are influential in the media. However, the book 'The Outsiders' presented findings that are contrary to the common wisdom. Capital allocators that are introverted, quiet, and brilliant seem to have a better shot at creating the most shareholder value - perhaps because they are less concerned about what the media thinks about them. 

Mr. Zang recognized that Lvji has created a blue ocean, '游中场景的蓝海市场', and is currently only at its early stage of growth. He believes that it is the best to make as little scene as possible while growing rapidly quietly. 

Risks

Micro-cap Chinese company: Corporate Governance
While there is a general understanding that larger Chinese companies that work very closely with the CCP are typically 'clean', I cannot have the same level of confidence in the smaller firms. The premise is that the Chinese government cannot afford to lose face if these large companies turn out to be fraudulent. This poses a huge reputational risk in the financial system and the CCP itself. China is still at a crucial stage of development to decouple from its '关系' roots, where 关系 is relationship in mandarin, and the line between corruption and relationship is blurred. 
I believe that few are foreign to the number of high profile frauds that come from China: Luckin Coffee, Sino Forest, Longwei Petroleum, and others that typically listed in the US via reverse mergers. A few red flags that I highlighted are:
• Several inconsistencies in the metrics reported in their IPO prospectus vs those reported in their interim and annual report. This could either mean that they are attempting to hide a slowdown or just be a lack of depth in reporting. 
• Little brand recognition in China. The reason why I completely discounted the value of its proprietary APP is due to a lack of presence in China. The reviews seem to be fake and bought.
• Odd IPO pricing. Lvji IPO'ed at HK$2.12, oversubscribed by 84.66 times. At HK$2.12, Lvji has a market capitalization of HK$3B. For a company that generated HK$642M in revenue, HK$203M in operating income, HK$190M in net profits, net cash of HK$91M in FY2019, that’s only a valuation of EV/Sales = 4.53x, EV/EBIT = 14.33x. Bear in mind that Lvji is a company that has its top line growing at 400%, 300%, and 80%, 3 years prior to its IPO. Why? 

High reliance on OTAs, lack of proprietary brand
It is clear that Lvji's business is entirely dependent on OTAs. I would argue that the more fragmented the OTAs are, the better it is for Lvji. Since Lvji will have greater bargaining power over these OTAs. However, if these OTAs suffer and, say, the industry undergoes a consolidation, the balance of power may shift and reduce the cut Lvji gets out of their products on the surviving OTAs. This is, of course, just speculation as I lack sufficient knowledge to know how the industry dynamics will pan out in the future. It is good to note that the top 2 customers, Meituan and Ctrip, represent 57.7% and 37.3% of their total revenue respectively. 

Execution Risk
From observing how Lvji allocates their capital and the update in the latest Interim Report, Mr. Zang has the intention to ramp up investments in developing their nascent content customization division. This is likely to require huge upfront investments for long term monopoly benefits over the customer's tourist attraction. Due to how new this area is, it is almost impossible to evaluate the probability of success of the venture. We are unable to tell how much competition there will be eventually if Lvji's progress proves to be promising and profitable. 

Lack of competitors for meaningful comparison 
Lvji has been very successful in dominating the online tour guide service market but this also means that there are no true competitors that we can draw a comparison to. It is unfair to compare to other companies in the travel industry, say the OTAs, given the vastly different competitive environment. We will have to make do with the information we have at hand and posit the likely outcomes. 


Investment Thesis
With downside risks considered, we explore what actually makes Lvji a compelling investment with favourable risk-reward ratios.

Promising outlook with a strong growth profile
From the above, I believe it is clear that odds are in the online tour guide market's and Lvji's favour for the industry to continue to experience strong growth post-COVID. The Total Addressable Market (TAM) is not easy to pinpoint due to the uncertainty behind the future growth of the industry. However, it is helpful to note that a 5% market share of the overall tour guide service market in 2023 would be RMB6.15B in online tour guide service market GMV, assuming an expected tour guide service market GMV of RMB123.7B in 2023. The GMV of online tour guide service market is at RMB340M in 2018. 

Cheap
The overall depressing short-term outlook of the travel industry has heavily penalized Lvji's share price unfairly. Lvji is a business that has experienced strong top-line growth of 400%, 320%, and 79.6% for the three years prior to its IPO on 16 January 2020. With an asset-light business model, it has also been able to generate positive and growing operating income with an attractive margin of approximately 30%. As a testament to its flexible asset-light model, Lvji has successfully optimized its cost structure and control its cash burn to only a -RMB14M cash outflow from operating activities. It may also be telling to note that Lvji has actually ramped up its investment activities from RMB234M for 6 months ended 30 June 2019, to RMB501M for the same period ended 30 June 2020. The investments are largely associated with its smart tourism initiatives and upgrading of its software. Lvji's has a healthy net cash balance of RMB549M as of 30 June 2020.

Lvji currently has a market capitalization of HK$1.3B, net cash of HK$651M (0.45HKD per share!), and EV of HK$649M. With 2019 revenue of HK$643M and EBIT of HK$186.3M, we have EV/Sales = 1.01x and EV/EBIT = 3.49x. This is beyond cheap even if Lvji stops growing. 

Unlikely to be a value trap
A value trap typically exists when a cheap business remains cheap for a very long time. This usually happens to melting ice cubes with ever-deteriorating business fundamentals. However, in the case of Lvji, given how fast it is expected to compound over the next 3-5 years, it is extremely unlikely for Lvji's market multiple to continue halving as its earnings double. 


Catalyst

Why does this opportunity exist and catalyst

1. COVID. A small no-name Chinese travel company with no big names backing decides to IPO in the peak of pandemic in China. It is likely that investors had no appetite to take on such a risk. With HK-listed companies only reporting twice a year, the first half of 2020 was horrendous for Lvji. Any update on performance is expected to only come in next year March. 
2. Micro-capitalization company with no analyst and media coverage. This is quite self-explanatory. This is likely to be the reason why there is little to no investor interests in the company. 
3. Strong domestic recovery. Domestic travel within China has already almost recovered to pre-COVID highs. More than 600M people travelled in China during Golden week. With the immunization program out in China and strong faith in the government, domestic consumption and tourism appetite have recovered extremely strongly. Added precautions to reduce physical contact has also benefitted travel software businesses like Lvji. Assuming Lvji still remains as the company as we know, the next interim report in March 2021 should show that Lvji is back to its growth trajectory. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/china-attractions-630-million-people-travel-during-golden-week.html

Valuation
It is more than an art than science to value a high growth company. Due to a lack of knowledge, I have no opinions regarding the long-term compounding potential of Lvji and will seriously consider exiting my position when the valuation becomes 'fair' as investors start recognizing what we have here. 
While I disagree with the widespread consensus of using EV/S to evaluate the cheapness of any high growth software business, a company with such growth profile, balance sheet, and margins listed in the US will typically command minimally a EV/S of 10.0x. An EV/EBIT of 20.0x - 30.0x seems fair for a business that is cash generative and expected to grow minimally for another 3-5 years with at least 20.0% CAGR, conservatively.
This gives us a present target price range of between HK$5 to $9. 

I believe that even after considering the risks associated with investing in an obscure COVID-hit travel stock in China, a strong alignment of management interests, strong balance sheet, and a cheap price tag offers very good risk-reward profile that warrants a high conviction position.

Revenue is generated based on a percentage of validated recoveries for clients. Contracts are negotiated on case by case basis, fees may range from 10-30% of recoveries and the duration of contracts may last 3-5+ years.  These are high margin, recurring revenue contracts, expected to provide multiple years of prolonged double digit growth.  
This is not a sexy business, quite boring in fact. However, a good investment should be boring. Hopefully you will also appreciate the new path management has coursed, and see the potential upside in this turnaround story.   
Historically, PFMT was known for its legacy business as a collection agency for student loans, federal/state tax delinquencies and other receivables. Since the taking over of student loan originations by the Federal government a decade ago, PFMTs student loan collections have seen a diminishing contribution to revenues over time. Currently, the student loans collection business accounts for about 22% of revenues. While ""Other"" legacy collections still account for about 26% of revenues. Growth in Other legacy collections has remained relatively flat over the years. A smaller business segment derives marginal revenues from first party call centers and licensing of hosted technology solutions to clients.  ***The diamond in the rough refers to PFMT's up-and-coming*** ***healthcare*** ***business segment***, composed of claims auditing and eligibility reviews. After seeing losses in 2018/19 due to high ramp up costs and standard implementation time lags, this segment appears to be set for robust growth going forward.  Management has been clear that from 2017-2019, adjusted EBITDA has witnessed a slowdown to reflect a period of transformation in the company to establish itself in the Healthcare space. Management has confidently reiterated their belief in successfully reaching a 2021 goal of achieving $200M revenue with 20% EBITDA margins, with double digit growth continuing for years to come.  


**Covid-19 Impact:**  
This year was shaping up to be a strong year for PFMT, as Q1 showed promising results that validated the new trajectory of the company. Unfortunately, Q2 and Q3 were impacted by the public health emergency related to Covid-19. The CARES act brought changes that affected the student loans collection segment. Student loan payments, interest accrual and involuntary collection of payments (wage garnishments) were originally suspended till September 30, 2020 but were extended till December 31, 2020. However, PFMT continued to generate student loan revenue for a number of months from existing in-process borrow rehabilitation agreements. Another impact of Covid came from existing healthcare audit customers that requested a short-term pause on PFMT activities. Mgmt has indicated these pauses have largely ended during the third quarter. To mitigate the impact of this temporary slowdown, mgmt had furloughed more than 500 employees which could result in savings of about $18 million. The company is now aggressively ramping up efforts (including hiring/recruiting). Mgmt anticipates the ramp up efforts to be properly reflected in revenue by Q1 of 2021.  
   
**Healthcare Business:**  
The healthcare platform has finally reached scale, accounting for the largest (and continually growing) contribution to PFMTs revenue. In Q3, the healthcare business generated $17.6M in revenue  (48.5% of total revenues (refer to Figure 1 below to view a cut out from the latest 10-k)). That is a 20.5% increase on sequential basis and a 63% increase from the same period last year. Please refer to figure 2 below, to see the change in healthcare revenues over time. This segment will continue to grow as Mgmt has made it clear this will be a main focus for the company. Soon healthcare will be the primary source of revenue (50%++), leading to a market multiple re-rate.  
Healthcare revenues over last 11 quarters:

Q3 2020= $17.6M  
Q2 2020= $14.6M  
Q1 2020= $17.5M  
Q4 2019=$14.3M  
Q3 2019= $10.8M  
Q2 2019= $9.3M  
Q1 2019= $9M  
Q4 2018= $9.9M  
Q3 2018= $6.6M  
Q2 2018= $6.1M  
Q1 2018= $3.5M

**Macro:**  
The macro environment indicates there should be tailwinds for the audit, recovery, payment accuracy and coordination of benefits outsourcing business solutions PFMT provides. According to the CMS, national healthcare expenditures are forecast to grow at 5.4% CAGR for the next 8 years. Reaching  $6.8T by 2028. Despite efforts to reduce the amount of improper payments, error rates in the industry range from 6% in commercial to 14.9% in government plans. Healthcare spending growth is driven primarily by a combination of increasing enrollment and cost inflation. Given the current unemployment environment, we are witnessing a spike in Medicaid enrollment, which should continue to benefit the business via rising utilization and claims volumes. It is useful to note that there can be a lag of several months between Medicaid eligibility and resulting claims volumes. This indicates that a majority of the benefits from the current environment are still to come. Also, as private organizations and state governments are struggling with lower revenues and budget deficits, this could create an increased focus on cost containment strategies where PFMT could play a supporting function. PFMT mgmt sees a $200B+ healthcare TAM growing annually.  
**Competitors:**  
PFMT differentiates itself with its proprietary technology and customizable approach to each of their customers' needs. The space is mostly dominated by large, slow moving players, that lack flexibility and uniqueness in their approach.  Major competitors include HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY-US, \~\~$3B mkt cap) and Cotiviti (acquired in mid-2018 for $4.9B). Contracts in this industry are limited, take time to implement and can last years. PFMT continues to build a moat around it's business by consistently winning, maintaining and being awarded new contracts. An example includes being re-awarded CMS recovery Audit Region 1 and being awarded the newly created Region 5. Thus, successfully showcasing PFMTs superior product and path to success in this space. PFMTs will continue to encroach on incumbents' healthcare market share as the market begins to realize the superiority of their technology and approach.  Refer to Figure 3, below, for an image taken form the CMS website showing the audit region relative to competition. Figure 4 may help to visualize the healthcare insurance payment cycle, and where PFMT may offer value.  
**Debt:**  
On Aug 2017, PFMT entered a credit agreement with an existing shareholder and customer, ECMC. As of September 30, 2020 PFMT has about $62M loan outstanding under this credit agreement.  ECMC has been able to accumulate about 5.8M warrants in PFMT as part of the agreement (about 10% of outstanding shares) all at an average exercise price of $1.95.  The effective interest rate was about 13.9% in the 1H 2020. The loan is classified as a current liability, with maturity in August 2021. However, PFMT has two one-year options to extend maturity.  
PFMT currently (as of Sept 30,2020) has about $17.3M cash and equivalents on hand and is entering a period of FCF generation.  
The current low interest rate environment offers low hanging fruit for companies looking to refinance their loans at a lower rate. Reducing their loan rate to 5-8% could save up to $5.5M in annual interest expense.  
**Timing/Technicals:**  
As the calendar approached their earnings announcement date (Nov 11), PFMT stock was trading around recent highs of $2. The stock started selling off aggressively into the earnings and significantly further following earnings (despite a very positive release). The selling pressure appears to have been caused by portfolio management layoffs at Invesco, a top holder. Public disclosure of these layoffs coincides with timing of initial selloff, and a recent 13G filing confirms the exited position. This should quell any fears holders and followers of this stock may have had, as the selling was not based on fundamental flaws in the company or a new short thesis. Invesco owned about 18% of PFMT. Following the recent pressure, it appears the stock is in extremely oversold territory. Since their exit, the average volume profile of the stock has improved significantly, making accumulating a position easier for both retail and institutional demand.  
**Valuation:**  
The timing of Covid partially contributes to why the market overlooked this stock, as Q2 and Q3 earnings were impacted. To establish a fair EBITDA estimation for 2020, we will use Q1 results with a conservative bias. Q1 is most appropriate because it will give us the clearest picture of how the company was performing prior to the temporary impacts of Covid. Using Q1, EBITDA was $6.4M (after deducting stock compensation).   Annualizing that amount will give us an EBITDA run rate of $25.6M. This is a conservative measure because we do not account for the impact of any potential interest rate savings or growth in the healthcare segment. Next we need to establish the enterprise value (EV= debt + mkt cap - cash). Which we use to calculate EV/EBITDA.  Calculation below.   
EBITDA= $25.6M  
Enterprise Value (EV)= $62M (debt) + $41 (mkt cap) -$17.3M (Cash) =  $85.7 M  
EV/EBITDA= 3.3X  
Fully diluted share count of 59.7M o/s

Now lets take a look at some Healthcare IT comparables. The first 7 are general comps, the bottom 3 are the most similar comps to PFMT. To clarify, HMSY is currently publicly trading and is a direct competitor to PFMT. In December 2019, HMSY acquired Accent (a coordination of benefits/payments accuracy unit of Intrado focused on commercial and Medicare Advantage payers) for $155M. Accent had generated about $50M of revenue during the 12 months ending october 2019 (vs PFMTs $150M revenues in 2019). Based on the transaction price, HMSY paid an estimated 11-12X EV/Ebitda on a TTM basis.  COTV was acquired and taken private in 2018, it continues to be a direct competitor with PFMT. COTV operated in payment integrity and was acquired for $4.9B in mid 2018, an estimated EV/EBITDA multiple of 14-15X based on consensus 2019 estimates.  Also, keep in mind that the average EV/EBITDA for S&P companies in 2020 is about 14.5X.

The market still largely views PFMT as a declining student loans collections firm. Yet growing beneath the surface is an attractive healthcare business. As this segment continues to grow the market will recognize the high quality recurring revenue, ability to scale, and increasingly healthcare-focused pure-play as a catalyst for a multiple rerate.  Now using the comps above, I will provide 3 scenarios (best, base, worst case scenario) applying a discount to conservatively account for the micro-cap nature and higher leverage of PFMT.     
In the best case scenario, we apply a 14X EV/EBTDA ratio (rounded down from the most similar comparable peer average of 14.3X) which, on a fully diluted share basis, lead to a current price per share of $6.   
In the base case scenario, we take a couple of notches off the closest peer average and apply a 12X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a current target price of $5.15/share  
In the worst case scenario, we further take off two more notches from the most similar peer average to apply a 10X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a price of $4.29/share.  
Also, considering the existing ownership of the company. Parthenon investors, Prescott Group, Mill Road Capital are all large shareholders. It is not unreasonable to think that they pursue a more aggressive activist role in the company and set it up for sale at a premium. It is also possible that competitors recognize the massive discount of this up-and-coming threat, and decide to acquire PFMT before other market participants drive up the price making such a strategic acquisition far more expensive. All of which offer upside to existing shareholders.  
As we approach future quarters and results continue to support this positive narrative we should start to see investor appetite pick up for this name. Average daily volumes have quadrupled since Invesco's recent exiting has added to the freely trading shares, improving the liquidity profile of PFMT.  These signals will start appearing on investor screens as they (professional small cap investors, value investors, quant investors, generalists, hedge funds, etc) look for new ideas. There is virtually zero sell-side coverage of this stock at the moment, this will likely change in the future. **Accumulating a position now, presents an opportunity for entry at basement level prices in a stock that has the potential to provide 500-700% upside.**

t3_kjjgmu,Looking at LIDAR (LAZR & VLDR),"I think there are substantial tailwinds for LIDAR technology given the macro shift towards EV adoption.   Because of this belief, I've been following LAZR relatively closely and have been researching some of its peers. I think the market is grossly overestimating LAZR's short-term prospects at profitability. I did a quick back-of-the-envelope multiples comparison of LAZR and VLDR (Velodyne), and I used the two companies' expected revenues for 2020. These are just forecasts so this analysis is far from complete/comprehensive, but VLDR's Price/Expected Revenue ratio is 42x. If my math is right, LAZR's is an *astonishing* **473x**. Both of these multiples are rather high for companies who have yet to turn a profit, but VLDR is much closer to actually doing so based on management's guidance in their most recent investor presentation.

I'm interested in knowing what other investors are thinking about these companies and LIDAR & EVs in general. I plan on purchasing VLDR sometime soon but it's slid pretty substantially today so I'm holding out for an even cheaper price as volumes continue to decrease at year end.

Edit: Wow thanks for the gold. I'm only 20 so I'm pretty new to this. Any advice/feedback/constructive criticism of my strategy and thought process is welcome!",33,0.85,1608831925,"[['VLDR', 3], ['LAZR', 2]]",VLDR,23.700000762939453,24.200000762939453

This is particularly with regards to bitcoin, and I'm more than happy to be corrected and convinced otherwise. 

This is my bear case: Bitcoin doesn't really have any real use-case unless you're trying to launder money or hide your source of funds. Sure you some niche vendors accepting it as a mode of payment but the price volatility is too much for mass adoption.
