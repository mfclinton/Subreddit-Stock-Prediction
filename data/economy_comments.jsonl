But that isn't actually a solution since all you're doing is making the problem worse.\r\n\r\nWhat concerns me the most about high levels of government debt is that, as debt increases, so too does the amount of money needed to pay off that debt. This means that government spending is increasingly directed towards debt servicing. This is money that could be spent on education, health care, infrastructure, and so on.\r\n\r\nJapan has been borrowing money for decades. Its current debt/GDP is around 300% IIRC. But the price of servicing this debt is low because interest rates are so low. The interest rates in the US are also low enough for it to be less of a problem.\r\n\r\n[This graph](http://i.imgur.com/IGPEMgt.png) is from one of the data spreadsheets I have, and shows how much debt servicing the US government has paid since 1951, as a percentage of GDP. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, Reagan and Laffer put America in the lurch in the late 1980s with deficit spending. Clinton and the Republican congress worked together (!) to create a budget surplus which, together with an expanding economy, brought things under control during the 1990s.\r\n\r\nThe graph also shows that deficit spending during the Vietnam War also increased debt repayments - and these repayments were greater than the inflation which eroded debt in the 1970s.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nMy solution is simple: raise taxes. Raising taxes will increase tax revenue, and the government will have more money to cover costs. Raise taxes far enough and you end up with a revenue surplus, which can be used to buy back the principal and reduce debt levels even further.\r\n\r\nI believe that balance is an important axiom in economics. A national government's debts should remain net zero over the long term. This allows for periods of debt increase, but also periods of debt reduction. The business cycle is the driver of this phenomenon. So, in theory, a national government should go into deficit during bad times and go into surplus in the good times, with a zero net balance overall.\r\n\r\nI do believe large debt levels hinder an economy's ability to perform at a reasonable level. The government bond market is huge, and people are making money simply by lending to the government so it can run its daily activities rather than lending to businesses so they can invest in capital. There is a level of \"crowding out\" that occurs.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nsources for graph:\r\n\r\n[GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)\r\n\r\n[A091RC1Q027SBEA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A091RC1Q027SBEA)\r\n\r\n", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1483933064.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_ebb2rv", "id": "fb4cnk7", "text": "Okay, I think there's quite a bit to unpack here. I'll try to make it simple.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, what happens in an economy, given that we ignore the possibility of deferred consumption. Goods and services change hands. As a sidenote, if a company can't sell a product for greater than cost or a person can't buy one for equal what they see it's worth as, it doesn't change hands. Thus we can assume *all* goods and services provided change hands.\r\n\r\nOr in other words, aggregate supply = aggregate demand.\r\n\r\nIn a basic model, you have three input factors, land, capital and labor. Land meaning not just land but natural resources, capital meaning non-perishable input factors, or things that don't \"go away\" when you use them, computers for example, or buildings, or machines.\r\n\r\nThe reason we generate \"value\" is that we combine those things to create something that's worth more. A pencil is more useful than a stick, a knife more useful than a piece of iron.\r\n\r\nSo let's say you have a very simple economy with two people, one person can make 10 fish a day, the other one can make 10 firewood a day. What's the output of the economy? Well, 10 fish and 10 firewood. What can they consume? 10 fish and 10 firewood. How that's distributed is a different question, maybe the one person is super cold all the time and will want to consume 7 firewood, maybe the other likes fish a lot, so they trade and one person ends up with 7 fish and 7 firewood and the other with 3 fish and 3 firewood. But that's not the question at hand, it's about total output/consumption, and this is basically how it works.\r\n\r\nWhere does money come in? Well, money is just a tool to make our lives easier. \"Just\", well of course an incredibly useful one, but not something that is strictly *necessary*.\r\n\r\nSo what's that money worth? The answer is 10 fish and 10 firewood. Because that's all you can buy. Why would money be worth more than what it can buy? This is called the [neutrality of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_of_money). It just *represents value*. Where that value *actually comes from* is the entire output of the economy.\r\n\r\nThat's also why it's basically irrelevant how much money there is, at least in the long run. The value of all money is just the value of all the output, it doesn't matter if there's 1000$ or 1$ for all of those 10 fish and firewood, it just means the numbers look different. This is also where inflation comes from. If the growth of the money supply is greater than the growth of the output, you get inflation.\r\n\r\nOr in other words, a larger amount of money is chasing a smaller amount of goods, thus each unit of money is worth less.\r\n\r\nOf course in the real world this is more complex, because you for example have the ability to shift consumption into the present/future. Creating lots of money and in turn lots of inflation would destroy savings, at least in the short term, and that would obviously be bad, for example.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1576506359.0, "tickers": []}

Moving in with someone who owns capital can allow all money coming in to be diverted to food and other goods that can be shared amongst the household as one or many members search for work or work precarious jobs. \r\n\r\nA more extreme example is a country like Brazil where an entire second economy developed in the form of favelas. Precarious housing set up by the people with their own systems for electricity, policing, and self-sufficient economy. It would essentially be like a mutation of the CHAZ or CHOP that is happening in Seattle right now, but on a multigenerational scale. The government would essentially “let go” of certain areas of major metropolitan cities, and the homeless and unemployed would be placed there to keep the “people of the asphalt” (to borrow a term from Brazil) feeling safe, and keep the homeless out of the central parts of the city. Police would essentially move the most impoverished away from urban centers, and a mix of the impoverished, downtrodden, and utopian creatives would create a civilization that the formal government would acknowledge but not intervene in unless it spilled out of the borders. Food would be grown in community gardens and bartering or local currencies (which also have a history in the US and are being used in some communities right now) would be standard.\r\n\r\nI think this is the only possible conclusion to the unfettered capitalism as we are currently defining it.

They can't steal it for their friends or give it to foreign governments if they never get it in the first place. \r\n\r\nPeople were crying about using a food bank for the first time in 50 years. Must be nice to have lived such a privileged life.\r\n\r\nYou're just gonna have to find a way to make it yourself if you don't want your income at the mercy of some other asshole. I'm never working a real job again. Our business is so multi faceted we can jump in one of five directions and we are malleable enough on some things. I could run a cash business or by mail order and we would still pull 500-1k a day.\r\n\r\nThe moment you fight against the current is when you drown. You will be one of the success stories if you can find a way to embrace this level of bullshit and make life easier for people getting back to some semblance of daily lives. Mask fashion, HVAC, and tons of other industries are going to have tons of new opportunities. You need to fight harder than ever and be ready to struggle.

{"submission_name": "t3_k8dp18", "id": "geylqo0", "text": "So you're talking about a couple of different things here. But let's straighten out our terms so we can have a common ground of understanding. \r\n\r\nCapitalism is an economic system, which means private individuals or corporations, through their capital, control the means of production. They sell their goods and services in a market. A contrasting system would be socialism, where the workers control the means of production. \r\n\r\nSo democracy is where power resides with the people, and a republic is representative democracy. People elect officials to represent them on their behalf.\r\n\r\nI believe, that you're highlighting the controversy between two systems of the U.S. (our capitalistic economic system and representative democratic system) where those who concentrate wealth in the economy, use that wealth to concentrate power/influence in our political system to create more wealth. Thus leading to income inequality and our government doing things that are not inline with public opinion. Please correct me if I've characterized your concerns incorrectly. \r\n\r\nThen you refer to evaluating government action, by \"asking who does it serve?\" To me, this refers to the legitimacy of the use of power. Which is something all humans should do. Just because you have power doesn't mean your actions are always legitimate.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1607362408.0, "tickers": []}
