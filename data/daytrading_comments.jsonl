The bar is raised in the eyes of the IRS — especially if you have significant trading losses with business ordinary loss treatment (Section 475) rather than capital loss limitations.\r\n\r\nIRS case law and Publication 550:\r\n\r\nIt’s not easy to be eligible for TTS. Currently, there’s no statutory law with objective tests. Subjective case law applies. Leading tax publishers have interpreted case law to show a two-part test:\r\n\r\n1. Taxpayers’ trading activity must be substantial, regular, frequent and continuous.\r\n\r\n2. The taxpayer must seek to catch the swings in the daily market movements and profit from these short-term changes rather than profiting from the long-term holding of investments.\r\n\r\nIRS agents often refer to Chapter 4 in IRS Publication 550, “Special Rules for Traders.” Here’s an excerpt: The following facts and circumstances should be considered in determining if your activity is a securities trading business.\r\n\r\n- Typical holding periods for securities bought and sold.\r\n\r\n- The frequency and dollar amount of your trades during the year.\r\n\r\n- The extent to which you pursue the activity to produce income for a livelihood\r\n\r\n- The amount of time you devote to the activity.\r\n\r\nThe IRS does not define the words “substantial, regular, frequent, and continuous” and case law also doesn’t give a bright-line test with exact numbers.\r\n\r\nMy Golden Rules on how to qualify for TTS:\r\n\r\nI base my Golden Rules on trader tax court cases and our CPA firm’s vast experience with IRS and state controversy for traders. The trader:\r\n\r\n- Trades full time or part time, all day, every day. Part-time and money-losing traders face more IRS scrutiny and individuals face more scrutiny than entities. Full-time options traders actively trading significant portfolios may not qualify because they don’t have enough volume and frequency and their average holding period is over 31 days. On the other hand, a part-time trader with a full-time job may qualify as a day and swing trader in securities meeting all my golden rules.\r\n\r\n- Hours: Spends more than four hours per day, almost every market day working on his trading business. All time counts, including execution of trade orders, research, administration, accounting, education, travel, meetings, and more. Most active business traders spend more than 40 hours per week in their trading business. Part-time traders usually spend more than four hours per day. In one tax exam our firm handled, the IRS agent brought up “material participation” rules (Section 469), which require 500 hours of work per year (as a general rule). Most business traders easily surpass 500 hours of work. However, Section 469 doesn’t apply to trading activities, under its “trading rule” exemption. Without this exemption, taxpayers could generate passive activity income by investing in hedge funds and the IRS did not want that.\r\n\r\n- Few to no occasional lapses: The IRS has successfully denied TTS in a few tax court cases by arguing the trader had too many breaks in trading, such as taking several months off during the year. Traders can take vacations, sick time, and personal time off just like everyone else. Some traders take a break from active trading to recover from recent losses and learn new methods and markets. Explain these breaks to the IRS in tax-return footnotes. Retooling and education during an occasional break may be acceptable. Keep good records of your time spent.\r\n\r\n- Frequency: Executes trades on close to four days per week, every week. It’s wise to prevent an IRS challenge by trading close to four days per week or 75% of available trading days — even if you need to make smaller executions with reduced risk on otherwise non-trading days. It’s not a good idea to have the tax tail wag the dog, and any trading you do for TTS should have an actual economic risk.\r\n\r\nHolsinger, Assaderaghi, Endicott and Nelson, options traders with less activity than equity or futures traders, only traded around 40% of available trading days, which is two days per week. Three days per week may be cutting it too close, so try to get closer to four. While we feel the IRS should also count working days when you don’t have an execution, it currently does not as evidenced by the Assaderaghi, Endicott and Nelson cases.\r\n\r\n- Volume: Makes 720 total trades per year (Poppe court) on an annualized basis. If you start July 1, then you need 360 executions, half of the 720. The court mentioned Poppe having 60 trades per month as being sufficient volume. Count the buy and sell, or open and close, as two total trades.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1518299227.0, "tickers": [["CPA", 1]]}

{"submission_name": "t3_901wd7", "id": "e2o4khd", "text": "When you want to analyze price + volume you have to do it in a systematic way and there are certain LAWS of price + volume analysis.\r\n\r\n1. You have to first establish the context and know the support and resistance levels.\r\n2. Then you look at how price and volume reacts ONLY at or near the support/resistance levels.\r\n\r\nIgnore the volume reaction at levels in between support/resistance.\r\n\r\nLet's take the example of MU yesterday. In premarket trading it established resistance at 57.5. Then after open on 2 minute chart the 9:38 EST bar broke out above that resistance on heavy volume and closed near high. Close of 9:36 bar was near 57.4 so now zone is 57.4 to 57.5. 9:38 action is bullish action and you will now be looking for long trades. The best way is to look for pullback back to support and then if price + volume action is favorable, then go long. After the breakout 57.4 to 57.5 area became support, so preferably you want to wait until price pulls back to 57.4 to 57.5 and retests that level in order to go long. For now you don't have a price based resistance level above support so you cannot look for short trades from resistance.\r\n\r\n9:44 and 9:46 pullback was on lower volume but you cannot go long yet because price is still near highs and it has not pulled back to support. How do you know it is not going to keep coming down on lower and lower volume? How do you know to go long after only 2 red bars in real time? Just wait patiently for pullback to support. If it keeps going higher and higher then don't chase.\r\n\r\nAt 9:54 price starts pulling back on lower volume. Wait patiently for pullback to 57.4 to 57.5 support area. If it doesn't pullback to 57.4 to 57.5 support then just don't trade. Usually after breakout from resistance price retests support. That test happened on 10:16 EST bar and price went all the way to 57.4. Notice the reaction to this test. Price opened near high, then tested support then closed back near high, on heavy volume (a hammer or downthrust on heavy volume). This seems favorable test of support but DON'T GO LONG YET. You want to see a LOW VOLUME TEST OF SUPPORT before you go long. **Whenever price tests support on heavy volume and wide range bar, it usually retests support and keeps testing support until there is a low volume test before it goes up**.\r\n\r\n10:22 bar retested support on lower volume. You could have gone long at close of that bar with a stop just below that bar (which would also be below 57.4 support). Notice that volume was lower but still about average so it is not the best long setup. The best long setup is when price tests support on VERY LOW VOLUME. 2 minute ATR at that time was around 10 cents so you could have put your stop 10 cents below entry of 57.42 with first scale out target of 20 cents (2 x ATR). This would have given you 1:2 risk/reward on the scale out portion and you would have runner after scale out in case price keeps moving up.\r\n\r\nAt 57.62 you scale out of your position. Then price comes back down to retest support of 57.4. This time the 10:36 test is on VERY LOW VOLUME. This is the BEST HIGH ODDS ENTRY for long. You go long again at close of 10:36 bar at 57.46 with stop below 10:22 bar. Closes of 10:22 bar and 10:36 bar were two places to go long, and 10:36 close was the better one because of **very low volume test of support**.\r\n\r\n", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1532014543.0, "tickers": [["LOW", 3], ["VERY", 2], ["LAWS", 1], ["MU", 1], ["ATR", 1], ["BEST", 1]]}

Basic knowledge (basic terminology, lingo etc.)\r\n\r\n2. Risk management (stop loss, position sizing, appropriate risk/reward, appropriate account size)\r\n\r\n3. Multi time frame analysis for context determination (whether background strength or weakness, whether trend or sideways range, whether near support or near resistance etc.)\r\n\r\n4. Price + volume analysis (Wyckoff method, volume spread analysis, candlesticks, level 2, tape reading, volume profile etc.)\r\n\r\n5. Support/resistance analysis (horizontal levels, trend lines, channels etc., swing high swing low pivots, profit targets, determination of stops etc.)\r\n\r\n6.

{"submission_name": "t3_92h6gz", "id": "e35t80l", "text": "Whenever you make a trade remember SETS: size (position size), entry, target, stop. You have to know all 4 things before you enter the trade. Have a written trading plan before you enter.\r\n\r\nIn your example, why did you enter at $6.10? What was the setup? Where was the stop? What was the exit target? Did you position size properly according to account size? etc. Ideally you should know all that before you enter the trade. Aggressive risk management is very important.\r\n\r\n1. Size: Never risk more than 1% of account on one trade. You also have to know where your stop loss will be to position size properly. For example if your stop loss was 0.9 below your entry and your account size is 5k then you should not trade with more than 50 shares. With 50 shares you will be risking $45 (50 x 0.9) which is less than 1% of 5k. If you traded 100 shares with stop of 90 cents and account size of 1k then your risk will be 9% of account which is too much risk and a sure way to eventually blow account. To trade 100 shares with stop of 90 cents (risking $90), you need account size of minimum 9k to keep risk at 1%\r\n\r\n2. Entry: You need to know why you entered at $6.10. What was the setup? Where was support and resistance? Was the stock in a trend or sideways range? Was stock breaking out and was it breaking out on heavy volume? What time frame you will enter on? You need to know answers to all these questions. It is a good idea to wait for a bit after open to see range, behavior, volatility, volume etc of stock so you can answer all those questions and then see if there is a high odds setup and reason for entry.\r\n\r\n3. Target: You should know what your exit target is. Where is the resistance? Resistance is a good place for exit target. If there is no resistance then you can use a multiple of ATR (average true range) for exit target or watch price and volume action to let price tell you when to exit, or have a trailing stop loss for exit. Make sure your risk/reward ratio is at least 1:1 (preferably 1:2 or better).\r\n\r\n4. Stop: Stop should be below nearest support or a multiple of ATR, making sure risk/reward is 1:1 or better. Stop should be at a place where you know you were wrong and your setup is violated. Stop distance will also determine your position size and account size needed for the trade as explained above.\r\n\r\nUsually with such an extreme move the stock is too extended and not a good idea to buy after such an extreme extended move. No stock keeps going up in a straight line and there is always a pullback. Wait for a low volume pullback on daily chart to enter again if stock remains in uptrend. Your second entry was after an extended move when price was making an inverted hammer on heavy volume (on 5 min chart) which is generally not a good idea.

My next big mistake(this contributed to me losing almost all of my initial investment more than anything else) was that I was trading with my WHOLE initial investment. I can only speak for myself but now I trade with at least 10% of my balance but no more than 25%.

First save enough money to fund a nice account 50k-100k. Second, set aside enough to live frugally for 2 yrs. Third, put 20% of your money and open an account. Most likely you will lose most of it. After 3 months put another 20% into the account and try to lose half. If after 3 months you break even then add another 20%.

This is because the loss is added to the next trade as an increase in cost basis. Let's say every trade you make is subject to the wash sale rule. You start the year with 10k and lose 2k to go down to 8000. Those 2k are disallowed losses. Then you make 3k to close out the year at 11000. Your total profit is 1000 or 1k. But you also have 2k in disallowed losses. Maybe you have even more than that, something like 4k or 5k because you made 3k in gains so there were losses along the way.\r\n\r\nSo you could have these two situations:\r\n\r\nYou profit 1k and have disallowed losses of 2k. You pay taxes on 1k.\r\n\r\nYou profit 1k and have disallowed losses of 4k. You pay taxes on 1k.\r\n\r\nYou don't get taxed on the gains from 8000 to 11000, but only the amount your account rose over the year, from 10k to 11k so your profit is only 1k, not 3k. This is because the cost basis of each trade is carried over into the next trade in the case of a disallowed loss. It's a fancy way of tracking your total account value. So if you make that 3k on your final trade of the year, say it cost you 8000 to buy it with your entire account, and you sell the position for 11k. Well, your cost basis starts at 8000 but your 2k in disallowed losses means for the purpose of taxes, your cost basis is now 10k for this position. So for tax purposes, you only made 1k on that trade. Make sense?\r\n\r\nOf course if you end up at 8000 then you have 2k in disallowed losses. If you made 80k at your job, then you have to pay 80k in income tax, not 78k, because you can't claim the losses to reduce your overall tax.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1546127767.0, "tickers": []}

Suppressing your emotions is a bad idea and it will not make anything better so try to understand and find out what causes them and then eliminate the root of those emotions. If you have a solid strategy with stops and tps there is no real emotions involved anyway, euphoria and mix of emotions when looking at a price is another horrible idea to get involved with since it will make you much more likely to start acting out of those emotions and then its gambling.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically work on your strategy and after every day and/or week analyse your trades (why did you enter, why did you exit) and make sure you did everything right and whether something could be approved. Once you start doing that and realising whether your strategy works and fits your personality then emotions should be pretty marginal because if you do everything according to your strategy there is no feelings that should come, price could go up or down do this or that, but if you have a strategy then it shouldnt affect you because you dont act based on the price fluctuations but rather on your strategy.

If you're set on trading stocks, take some of the highest movers of the day, and look at the intraday action (5m bars, for example). If you're wanting to trade futures, look at some of the biggest movers of the day and do the same thing - look at the intraday action.

Develop a strategy that will get you into these moves every time they happen, without fail. Create rules that are objective and systematic, so you can backtest and foreward test, to get win % and other statistics that give you an idea of how well the strategy might perform over a large sample of trades. (This is just an example - it doesn't need to be big movers you're looking for. In my case, I like things that move a lot, so that's what I looked for)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what kind of setup you want to trade - literally just look at a bunch of charts of the types of overall moves you want to be a part of, and create a system that will get you into those moves. If you test that system and it turns out not to be profitable, or not as profitable as you want, either tweak the rules or rinse and repeat the process. It takes a lot of work, trying out different indicators, support/resistance ideas, volume profile, etc. until you land on rules that work for your desired trades. A lot of trial and error will occur, and you'll probably change methodologies multiple times.

You'll have positive cash balance for which any decent broker will pay *you* interest. The borrowing interest is usually much less than the interest paid to you, for a net positive interest paid to you.

You can even see decent volume and order flow information if you look at the futures that correspond the the Forex pairs you are trading.\r\n\r\nCertainly, some things will be a bit different. The way it moves, the way it reacts to news, the kinds of macroeconomic events that have impact on price, will all be different. But that's just a matter of learning and getting used to it. Similar to how one stock might have a different personality than another (although the \"personality difference\" from Forex to a stock might be a big greater than from one stock to another stock).\r\n\r\nThe fact that it's a \"currency pair\" doesn't really matter from a price action perspective. Let's look at one pair: for example, take the EUR/USD. That's really just \"the price of the Euro currency\" (quoted in U.S. dollars). Just a price. You could think of this similarly for a stock. Say, \"AAPL/USD\" — the price of one share o Apple stock, \"quoted in U.S. dollars\". Just like when you acquire AAPL you give U.S. dollars, when you buy the EUR/USD pair, you acquire EUR and you give U.S. dollars. It's essentially the same thing that's happening.\r\n\r\nThe one year you spent studying stocks wouldn't be wasted if you decide to trade a different product (such as Forex), especially since from what I could gather you didn't trade live yet. Once you start trading live, then you truly start getting a feel for the nuances of different products, but the trading mechanics and the price action basics, it's all the same.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Forex isn't my thing. I don't like the way it moves — I got used to trading completely different types of products. There's also the fact that I don't like that it's decentralized — I prefer to have an exchange and a clearing house being the middle man rather than a typically much smaller entity like a broker. Finally, a very long time ago I lost what to me was a huge amount of money at the time, so there's some negative psychology for me there as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, like others said, you might be able to trade Crypto. Same spiel as above — call it \"product X\", there's price action, charts, historical data, bids, asks, limit orders, etc. There are lots of exchanges around the world, you might be able to find one either accepts people from Iraq or that are completely anonymous.\r\n\r\nGood luck on your search!", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1566364092.0, "tickers": [["AAPL", 1]]}

I will walk away and won’t trade once I see some money on the table to give me good monthly income.\r\n\r\nI usually prefer to trade without a profit target. If I walk away, I could miss out on a bunch of good trades.\r\n\r\nThe most recent example is from today. I was trading the ES, and had made a decent chunk of money as the market was going down to the \\~2965 area (around 1300 EST). The rhythm changed a lot, the excitement went away for way over 1h. Small moves, much lower volume. I could definitely have walked away, and it would have been a good day. Instead, I stayed. Trump tweeted, pushing the market up around 18 points very quickly, and I was able to get around 1/3 of that movement, the final part. And then the market came back down, and I got around 1/2 of that move down.\r\n\r\nA good day became a *very* good one, just because I stayed longer of walking away after an arbitrary \"profit target\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>13. \\[...\\] I have been in trades that could give me $5000-30000 in single trade but I get our with 1000-2000 and then watch myself fall it further and end up chasing and lose what I made.\r\n\r\nFor quite sometime, I've been very hard on myself on situations like what you describe there — e.g., I made $2k on a trade that could have given me $10k. This would make me angry, frustrated, which greatly decreased my subsequent performance (e.g., like you said, I would very often \"lose what I made\").\r\n\r\nI would focus more on something like, \"damn, I lost $8k, since I could have made $10k on this move but I only made $2k\". I would feel like an idiot who lost a ton of money. While in fact, I actually made some money.\r\n\r\nWhat really helped me was to realize that I most likely *couldn't* have made $10k. *After the fact* it might be clear where I could have entered and exited the trade. But this is confirmation bias. In real-time, things are very different. What I could do is look back and try to adapt my trading to get more out of that max $10k that was available.\r\n\r\nTook me a while to improve on this!\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n>16. LASTLY I WILL FOCUS ON WINNING TRADES SO WILL ONLY TAKE HIGHEST PROBABILITY TRADES. I want to keep my win ratio over 70%.\r\n\r\nLike r/provoko mentioned, \"win ratio\" could be a problem. Could be very misleading. E.g., if you take just random trades all day long, and you configure a take-profit order at a 1 tick profit, and a stop-loss order at a 10 tick loss, you'll probably do even better than 70% win rate. But you'll most likely end up losing a ton of money.\r\n\r\nAlso, many option traders focus on using strategies that have very high win probabilities — you can construct options positions with whatever probability you want. But usually the higher the probability of winning, the smaller the win will be and the larger the loss will be. Many beginners get their accounts wiped out because of 1 loss that was considered extremely unlikely.\r\n\r\nFor me, personally, looking at a \"win ratio\" isn't very helpful. The metric I want to optimize is my daily gains, and in my experience there's little correlation between daily gains and win ratio.\r\n\r\nA somewhat distinct metric I like to look at, and that I found to have significant correlation with my daily performance, is the amount of commissions I pay as a percentage of my gains. I mainly trade futures with IB, so I pay a per-contract fee. For \"fixed commissions\" structure (e.g., $5 regardless of trade size), such a metric probably wouldn't be very relevant. Today was a very good trading day — I paid about \\~6.3% of my gross profits in commissions. On a bad day, this could be somewhere around 20% to 30%. On an incredible day (which is usually due to being excessively lucky), this could be around or less than 1%.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1569368092.0, "tickers": []}

Sadly, paper trading or any other method of short cuts may not yield positive results. \r\n\r\nWhat in my opinion a trader needs is an objective evaluation that he could see objectively what he/she does. However, then the challenge becomes how do you become conscious of your mistakes and how do you attribute the right success factors to your P&L.

Brokers are constantly seeking new traders because so many of them lose everything.\r\n\r\nSecondly, options trading in the stock market is relatively straightforward, and you can do it with a small account because options are leverage on shares. In other words, you won't blow out your account at a 2% loss in 1 trade like you can do in forex with huge leverage. Let's say you have 1x leverage. If price drops 50%, you're done. Now if you have 100x leverage, your total loss happens much earlier. I can't math right now but I'll assume it would happen at -1% or 2%.\r\n\r\nWith options, what you see is what you get. The option premium itself moves, but until that hits 100% loss, you still have money there. So it's simpler to manage vs leveraged forex trading.\r\n\r\nThirdly, you need to take things very seriously to have any hope of winning. You know all of those free trading tutorial videos on YouTube? Most of them are wrong. Very few of them will actually tell you why something happens. Instead they just give you a strategy without explaining why it is a higher probability strategy.\r\n\r\nThere are many gimmicks out there that are totally wrong. For example, RSI is a bounded strength indicator. It measures relative strength by looking at recent candles' gains vs losses. The more gains there are, and the higher their average vs the average losses, the higher RSI is. \r\n\r\nThe problem with RSI is it can only go as far as 0 to 100. It can't go to 101. Therefore it is NOT a good idea to call 70-80+ RSI \"overbought.\" The same applies to low RSI and the term oversold. It's simply wrong. Like I said, many YouTube channels will simply say, buy at low RSI. That's not a great idea considering the stock would be at its weakest at that point.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to figure out is which indicators are doing what, and then put a few of them together and use logic to help you come up with reasons why such and such an entry is better than another.\r\n\r\nWhen your money is on the line, you want the highest winrate possible, with the highest reward possible, and not necessarily the least risk possible, but you certainly want relatively low risk.\r\n\r\nI'm just concerned that you might be diving in headfirst into daytrading after you held a trade far beyond where your risk should have been. It will probably take you 1-2 years just like most other successful traders, to be even close to profitable.

{"submission_name": "t3_ddemnw", "id": "f2xg46j", "text": "Some comments.\r\n\r\n> Hello guys i have been \"long term investing\" for like 1.5 year\r\n\r\nI wouldn't use whatever experience you had during that time to help you make decisions today — 1.5yr isn't \"long term investing\" (like you seem to understand well based on your comments in other posts).\r\n\r\n> It sounded sketchy at first and backed by statistics like \" 95% of day traders lose money\" ( great way to lie with statistics btw) so i have been hesitant to start engaging in it.\r\n\r\nThis is a never-ending debate. Some people will swear by these statistics, some people will say they are bullshit.\r\n\r\nMy take on this is that **these statistics are meaningless.** Trading the markets has an extremely low barrier to entry, so anybody with a cell phone and a few hundred bucks, who's bored one day, can buy and sell something on the markets. It's almost certain that they will lose. Count those, and you'll quickly get to 90%, 95%, 98%, whatever the number is (different sources will say different numbers).\r\n\r\nThe thing is — if you are willing to **approach this *the right way*,** that is, not as something you do on a 5 minute break, on your cellphone, around the water cooler, but **seriously, as a profession,** then that number changes greatly.\r\n\r\nAlso, you'll eventually notice that the vast majority of people dedicate themselves far less than they believe they do.\r\n\r\n> So my goal now is to grow my account to 5000 dollars and after that having a goal of ~20% per month\r\n\r\nDoable. ***But extremely hard***, especially in the first few years of day trading (and don't count that 1.5yr you mentioned here, as they are almost completely useless).\r\n\r\nTo put that into perspective, that number translates to making around 0.8% a day.\r\n\r\nSome people will say you are out of your mind with that number, as they'll calculate you're talking about making 790% a year, and will then compare with the SP500 or something which returns ~7%/yr, give or take. That argument is bullshit, as it's comparing two things that are absolutely different — passive investing in an index vs profiting from intraday movements. There's no energy or effort put into passive index investing; there's a *tremendous* amount of energy and effort put into making 0.8% a day.\r\n\r\nTo end this topic, I'd say that if you approach day trading with this mindset, you likely have a very small chance of succeeding. Remember, this is a profession, not a get-rich-quick scheme.\r\n\r\n> most of the times i see you guys suggesting the FX market as an easier way to grow a small account\r\n\r\nThis is probably because of leverage. With FX, in many places you can have insane leverage. The problem is that it also greatly increases your risk of ruin (i.e., getting your account value to $0 — or less — and then you don't have money to open a new trade to recover; ruin).\r\n\r\nWhile you're learning, it's probably safer to use little or no leverage. That will really teach you skills that you can use later when you start using leverage.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding spot FX, I don't like it. There's no central, regulated market place, it's a big mess of decentralized, interconnected banks, dealers, brokers. If you do like the way currencies move, and you want to trade them, there are incredible better ways to do it — there are currency ETFs, and there are currency Futures. These all trade in centralized, regulated locations. You won't be betting against your broker that has an almost absolute advantage against you — you'd be trading with the market.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1570478022.0, "tickers": []}

They will have to change along with the market.\r\n\r\n> I have a bachelor’s in cs and have considered going down that route, but can’t help thinking it would be a never ending rabbit hole looking for the holy grail\r\n\r\nBachelor's in CS isn't going to be very helpful. For one, it doesn't mean a person is good at software development. Also, yeah, it's going to be a never ending rabbit hole, since, like I mentioned before, markets change, and your code will need to change accordingly. So instead of changing the setups you look for to trade, you'll change the code that identifies the setups to trade.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't fall into the \"AI\" trap here. I've seen just too many discussions recently on this sub (or maybe others? dunno) with people throwing the term \"AI\" and it's clear that the vast majority has no idea what that even means. Some of the funnier (in a not very positive way...) comments were even clearly showing that their authors had some sort of idea of using a sentient robot to trade. Nonsense. The correct thing to study here would be ML (rather than \"AI\" — even though some may use the terms interchangeably, there's a very significant difference). Even so, the extent to which ML algorithms can help is quite limited. They may be very useful for certain things, like forecasting trends on certain parts of an earnings report — but that doesn't help you to day trade. It may help with some very long-term decisions on capital allocation for a large portfolio, but that's it.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, rabbit hole. A never ending, nasty one. With probably no holy grail in the end, or at least not one that will last any significant amount of time.\r\n\r\n> what is it exactly that leads people to say to expect it to take multiple years to learn how to trade?\r\n\r\nIn one word, **experience**.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of things that you can only learn through experience. And that means being exposed, while trading, to a large variety of market conditions. That's one reason why it takes such a long time to learn how to trade. Also, during that time a lot of things will start coming together and making sense as part of a bigger picture. It takes a while for the bigger picture to start taking some form, too.\r\n\r\n> Am I eventually going to learn that it’s more complicated than this?\r\n\r\nOther than as \"words of encouragement\", such as \"yeah! you'll make it! we trust in you!\", no one can tell. It's mostly under your (and only yours) control.\r\n\r\n> Or is it the case that I just need to be especially wary of new sets of problems that come when one actually starts to make money that I’m currently unaware of? Are they psychological?\r\n\r\nOnce again, experience. And a very personal aspect of it: psychology. Almost impossible to tell what will go through your head, how you'll behave, how you'll react, how you'll handle it.\r\n\r\n> Does scaling up always lead to some level of failure, even if you're trading with sizes in the same proportion to your account?\r\n\r\nPsychology may play a role here.\r\n\r\nAlso, depending on the market you trade, you may eventually hit capacity issues — that is, trades that work at a certain small size may cease working (or may need to be adapted) at a larger size. E.g., you can throw 10 contract orders on CL without moving it; if you try to scale it 10x, well, you might have trouble with that, you may need to work a 100 contract order more slowly.\r\n\r\n> Will $2000 always feel like a lot of money, even if you're trading with 6+ figures, and thus lead you to make terrible decisions? Or are there different problems of a totally different nature?\r\n\r\nMy experience is that it may get a different meaning.\r\n\r\nA very long time ago, I traded mostly for the learning I was getting. It didn't pay bills or anything — for quite a long time, it's been a double income household (me and my wife both working full time jobs paying good salaries). Some time ago I switched to full time trading and don't have a full time job anymore (wife still does). But now my contribution to the household income comes from day trading, so profits are now not just the results of a learning process, but part of them are used to pay bills. New meaning. New psychology.\r\n\r\nGoal is to eventually, in the not so distant future, to have profits larger than what our full time jobs combined used to pay. And then, again, I believe it will get another new meaning, new psychology.

They know close to nothing about real trading, and they know close to nothing about education. They only know a bit about marketing, enough to sell their BS.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that being a good educator on subject X doesn't mean they have to be brilliant in subject X itself. They need a great understanding, they need to know what people struggle with, and how to help them. But that doesn't mean they need to be independently brilliant at subject X.\r\n\r\nI worked in the education industry for a *very* long time (unrelated to financial markets). Throughout my career, I met a ton of fantastic educators who weren't brilliant in whatever it was they were teaching, but they did an amazing job teaching their subjects. Teaching subject X and working with X are things that usually require two completely different skillsets.\r\n\r\n> Before I address my situation, is there any trader who can show me proof of their successes before providing advice; establish your credibility please.\r\n\r\nMost serious traders probably won't. I won't show anything. No one owes you proof of anything. And probably no one will really think about it too much if you simply disregard good advice because you feel entitled to proof that was not provided. It's your call to use whatever you get or to dismiss it.\r\n\r\n> MY SITUATION / I picked up interest in day trading with extra savings I gathered after investing in real estate and safer long term securities / index funds.\r\n\r\nAlmost 100% of one's experience in those types of long-term investments is useless for day trading. Day trading requires a completely different skillset compared to that kind of stuff.\r\n\r\n> I’m an IT Professional with affinity for math / numbers\r\n\r\nI have a similar background. It doesn't help nearly as much as one would expect. I mean, if you can quickly calculate a theoretical average entry price after scaling in and out a few times during a given trade on your head, or if you can easily write a script/program for that in case your platform does something funky, great. But as a retail day trader, you won't be using your math / IT skills for the practice of *trading*. \r\n\r\nMy day trading improved tremendously starting from the moment I had that realization. I stopped wasting time trying to leverage my math and IT skills, which are extremely good might I add, and I started focusing on learning something completely new.\r\n\r\n> [I] had $25,000 within my means of risk so I decided to give it a go.\r\n\r\nThat's a good chunk to start with. And you seem to be already way ahead of the vast majority of people new to day trading: you have risk capital, and an amount that already allows you to do quite a lot of interesting stuff.\r\n\r\n> Admittedly, most of my “education” was from my limited study of online stocks trading videos, articles, blogs, etc.\r\n\r\nRed flag.\r\n\r\nEducation is absolutely fundamental. You need to learn a tremendous amount of stuff that is completely outside of the realm of IT or math.\r\n\r\nThere are some useful resources on the wiki on this sub, and in a few other subs as well.\r\n\r\nIMO, a structured approach is fundamental. Reading random blogs and watching random videos will not give you a concise experience. A full, well designed course (online or not, doesn't matter) will give you a much better experience as each topic connects to other previous topics in a somewhat natural way.\r\n\r\n> I don’t have a formal finance / investment banking education from an accredited institution.\r\n\r\nDon't worry about that. That's absolutely not necessary for day trading.\r\n\r\n> I [...] traded with a demo account between Aug - Oct 2019. I was able to generate over 60% in profits in 2 months so thought I might give trading with a real account a shot.\r\n\r\nIMO demo trading is useless. The only value one can get from that is to learn how to use a trading platform: where to click, what are the keyboard shortcuts, etc.\r\n\r\nBut it won't help develop an edge or deal with  emotions. And those are the most fundamental things one needs to become successful. Also, the engine of the most paper trading systems does a terrible job at simulating the market.\r\n\r\nYour story is evidence: the 60% profits you had in 2 months didn't translate to real-world performance. If anything, it may have been detrimental! It could've given you the impression that you were ready to go...\r\n\r\nTrade with 1 share of stock if you must. But use real money on real markets.\r\n\r\n> I used $25,000 (all within means of my risk) to day and swing trade as a real world experiment while studying techniques using my limited knowledge. Most of the stocks were energy, oil, & cannabis stocks. I lost over 50% of my portfolio in just over a month.\r\n\r\nIt's good that you have this clear notion about risk capital — ie, the *$25k is within means of your risk*, like you said.\r\n\r\nBut to lose 50% in one month is just absurd.\r\n\r\nThink about it — if you could transfer your completely unrealistic paper trading results to the real market, that is, 60% return in 2 months, it would take you about 3 months in the real market *just to return to break even* (i.e., you need a 100% return after your 50% loss to break even; 3 months at 60% per 2 months is around 100% if you compound gains).\r\n\r\nProbably the first thing you absolutely need to work on is ***risk management***. Preserving capital is the absolute top priority. Without capital, you are out. Don't even think about trying to make good money before you are really good at keeping what you have.\r\n\r\n> To be fair and transparent, I blame my losses on lack of education and experience. I did not know how to incorporate stop losses, triggers with deltas, OCO, OTA etc. I don’t have a day trading platform (like TOS) that assists in visualizing candle stocks, MACD, RSI etc. I have the basic TD web broker platform. I take responsibility for the aforementioned.\r\n\r\nYou demonstrate an incredible amount of clarity. So you know a lot of what you need to work on.\r\n\r\n> 1. IF day trading is actually a plausible means to generate consistent profits, where can I look to gain QUALITY education? I don’t mind taking certifications or even an online diploma / university course.\r\n\r\nCertifications are completely useless. Their only purpose is to prove something to someone — and in the vast majority of cases, having a certification doesn't translate to having any knowledge. I'm an extremely skilled test-taker; I'd probably be able to have pretty good scores on most certifications even if I knew close to nothing about their subjects...\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, university courses or online diplomas won't teach you anything really useful related to day trading.\r\n\r\nThe education that will work for you greatly depends on what products you want to trade, and the trading style that you'll develop.\r\n\r\nI don't day trade stocks, which is what you talked about, so I can't help you with what are good resources for that.\r\n\r\n> 2. What techniques and key variables should I be looking for while trading / investing until I get “formally” educated? I need to make a 100% return to offset my loss of $13,000. Are there any stocks that I can look into which have this potential within the next year?\r\n\r\nFirst, trading and investing are completely different things. You seem to mention them as if they were interchangeable terms, multiple times in your message.\r\n\r\nInvesting is something that probably everyone with disposable income is capable of and should be doing. Trading is a profession, demands time, focus, and a very specific skillset that may not be for everyone.\r\n\r\nAgain, you don't need \"formal\" education, with or without quotes. You need to develop skill. After you get your knowledge, it's about developing skill: practice, practice, practice. Repeat, fail, repeat, fail. You'll improve in the process. And you'll stay in the game as long as the knowledge you got on risk management was good enough.\r\n\r\nFinally, you seem to be looking at it from the wrong angle: don't think that you're gonna recover your $13k by making a 100% return in one year. And if you do, it will actually be very detrimental to your learn, as it might seem like you were responsible for making such a great return, while it will be due to luck.\r\n\r\nThink of the $13k as a *very expensive lesson* you already spent the money on. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a lot to learn from that lesson...\r\n\r\nThink that your risk capital is now $12k, and that's what you got to work with. Preserve that. Develop your skill.\r\n\r\n> 3. Does anyone have suggestions on how I can build my own SYSTEM to attempt to make consistent profits?\r\n\r\nIf by SYSTEM you mean some code trading automatically for you, see above. TLDR — don't waste your time.\r\n\r\nIf you mean developing an edge, it truly depends on the products you trade. And like I said, I don't trade stocks, can't help you here.\r\n\r\n> 4. Is swing trading a better approach? In my experience, this seemed a more plausible method of trading.\r\n\r\nSwing trading is a completely different approach: you'll be holding positions for much longer. I don't like it because to me it feels incredibly more risky than day trading — it frightens me to hold risk overnight, or over the weekend. When I'm day trading, very often I'm in and out in a matter of seconds or minutes.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I'll do that resembles swing trading is trading options. I usually establish option positions that I hold (and manage, modify, adapt) for many days, sometimes a few weeks. With these, I have absolute control over my risk, so that a bizarre overnight event that might completely crash a stock, for example, will not damage my portfolio much.", "score": 27, "created_utc": 1575435439.0, "tickers": [["X", 4], ["TRUE", 1], ["RSI", 1], ["TD", 1]]}

It' s truly the modern day \"Wild West\" of financial internetspace where many of these scams are just selling elixir dreams and failed at their trading journey themselves yet learned to fool newbs for monthly or package fees and subs. That said, I'd suggest reading some TA books, and then going back to sim, forget about the loss, and after simming for another half year or longer then going small , perhaps with futures if you don't want to risk using an offshore broker to beat the PDT for daytrading stocks under $25k. (yes, sorry the loss is personally terrible. But guaranteed there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands who lost, and probably many who lost more than you starting out around the world. trading is private, but I think the truth is most of one's every other middle class neighbors have tried it at some time and most have kept their attempts and losses quiet.

You're an IT guy so I'd suggest [this book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111909657X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) to get started with algo coding mainly for testing your own ideas. His older book ([here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471381357/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2)) is actually a good primer on TA and daytrading in general ,  imo, which covers a lot, like on working out your own system from suggested elements eventually. An alternative is testing ideas in C# on ninjatrader , sierracharts, or multicharts. futures.io is a decent discussion resource on those more futures oriented platforms. \r\n\r\n5. I primarily daytrade futures. Maybe someday I'll try swing trading stocks again. Emmett at tradingschools dot org seems to like swing trading. ([example](https://www.tradingschools.org/reviews/high-probability-etf-trading/)). (but I don't buy into Larry Connors).

I've had many instances where I just finished a trade, saw a setup I was fairly sure on, but held back.  It's important to understand when it's time to take a step back.  It's also important to understand when you missed an opportunity and to move on.  Don't be a chaser, wait for the setup and then go.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1576728515.0, "tickers": []}

It's essentially 2 \"real\" accounts, one for securities and one for futures, that they move cash back an forth as necessary so to me it ends up being only one.\r\n\r\nWhat I do is I keep around 130% of the account's total equity in my long term holdings: some stocks and some ETFs, with some options to hedge part of the risk. All this consumes around 25% of my available margin, leaving quite a significant amount to day trade with.\r\n\r\nAll that is inside what IB calls \"model portfolios\" - they are grouped and kept separately, from an accounting perspective, from the \"independent\" portion of the portfolio, which is where all my day trades go to. This way, I can easily see what returns are due to each long term portfolio, and which returns are profits from my day trading.\r\n\r\nWhen the profits from day trading get to around 8% to 10% of the account value, I withdraw a salary and move the rest into the long term holdings to make sure it's at 130% capital utilization and well balanced between the different model portfolios.\r\n\r\nThis way, I allow the account to grow with both part of my day trading profits as well as capital gains from long term holdings, which allows me to increase my day trading size as I feel more comfortable, and I withdraw cash to live with.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1577221379.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_esuqko", "id": "ffdfk68", "text": "> Can't for the life of me understand why trade data APIs are so fickle.\r\n\r\nIt really varies a lot.\r\n\r\nAlso, generally speaking, \"you get what you pay for\". A reliable, stable, high capacity, low latency data feed has a lot of infrastructure costs, which usually means the provider will charge you for it.\r\n\r\n> I don't get why Yahoo! don't properly formalize their web offering.\r\n\r\nThat's an example of something that's definitely not on the higher end of reliability.\r\n\r\n> Donating. Human resources aside, the cost of running this service is about 0.1 bitcoin per year.\r\n\r\nGonna do some educated guessing here, just to try to clarify why it's generally the case that highly reliable systems cost money (and are not cheap!). Please, don't take any of this personally! And, like I said, this is a guessing game; it's based on 2 pieces of information that are publicly available: that it costs 0.1 BTC / yr to operate (from your website, quoted above), and that the IP address that rdmp.org is pointing to belongs to AWS in Ireland (from publicly available DNS and whois information).\r\n\r\nThat's around $70/mo at current BTC prices. Seems like you're running that on AWS in Ireland. That's around $0.10/h total. This means that it's running on no more than 4 \"VMs\" (e.g., 4 EC2 instances, or maybe 2 EC2 instance + 1 RDS multi-AZ) if using the absolute smallest instances (other than the burstable families). More likely, and when considering data transfer costs as well as storage (and backup!), it probably means no more than 2 \"VMs\", more likely 1. But let's say 2. With 2 VMs, it's either web tier + db tier with 1 instance each tier, or web/db all together, with 2 instances with everything. In either case, that's not really a \"production-like\" environment. With 1 instance per tier, there are multiple single points of failure. With 2 instances in a \"all-in-one monolith\" tier, there are scalability and management challenges. In either case, an instance crashing would lead to probably some 60s-300s for the whole system to be fully operational again, assuming a pretty good amount of automation (eg, ASG, or auto recovery, somehow moving IP addresses or domain name settings around as there's no remaining budget there for an ELB, etc).\r\n\r\nThis is definitely something that could be great \"for free\" or \"with a donation\". Probably for a \"hobbyist consumer\" — someone who may enjoy being able to put together some quick scripts to look up data and then go trading with the info. Heck, I do that myself a lot! Like you, I spent a ton of time creating code to scrape all sorts of web pages, dealing with broken HTML, etc. Then the website makes a tiny change, boom, big chance I'll have to adapt my code. Pain in the ass. An API like that could be a great improvement on that experience! And, best of all: I don't pay anything for it (maybe a donation, some time), you pay almost nothing for it (and hopefully gets some of the cost back in donations, maybe even a few beers a month if enough people donate!).\r\n\r\nGreat deal for everyone.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would certainly not use that system for any production-level trade automation. Not even for a production-level data source for my discretionary trading: I would be too distracted worrying that the service may go down, and my performance would suffer.\r\n\r\nFor production stuff, I need to know that it's incredibly unlikely even at crazy confidence levels that the system would go down. Also, I need to know that in the tiny little chance that it goes down, it recovers really, really fast. I want it to be at least as reliable as my code running in my infrastructure (which is pretty damn reliable!). Also, I want to make sure that no matter what happens in the market, data will still flow, without the service getting overwhelmed. And if more and more people start to use it, it will still maintain the performance.\r\n\r\nAll of that can be done. In fact, before transitioning to full time trading, that was essentially my main occupation. The thing is: it costs money. A lot of money. So whoever provides that kind of service charges accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs an example (and I have no relationship with them, I just used to be a customer, but not even that anymore), check out these guys: https://www.iqfeed.net/\r\n\r\nTheir offering is super high quality.

{"submission_name": "t3_fa0lzf", "id": "fiv5rdf", "text": "Maybe your system doesn't have an edge when you try for unbalanced RR ratios (1:2, 1:3, etc.)... A trading system can still have positive expectancy even if the R:R is 1:1. \r\n\r\nWhat you correctly identified is the issue of the trade-off between *confirmation* and *entry location*. The best entry locations have little to no confirmation and the best confirmations have poor entry locations. Backtest your ideas in different ways to find the system that has the best expectancy (over a large sample size of hundreds, if not thousands of trading events), but I think that usually starts with the 1:1 and then work up from there.\r\n\r\nSo you test your system with 1:1 parameters but also measure in your trade log what I've seen called \"maximum favorable excursion,\" which is basically a standardized way that you assess how much of the moves you're actually capturing on average. You want to standardize it into percentages so that you can uniformly analyze the data even if they involve different nominal amounts (variable stop distances, targets, volatility, etc.) \r\n\r\nAn example set of parameters for measuring maximum favorable excursion would be that you exit the trade, note how long you were in the trade, then watch until double that amount of time has passed. Once double that amount of time has passed you mark the maximum distance how far in your favor *that trade would have gone* had you stayed in. Your actual exit divided over the maximum favorable excursion amount will give you a percentage, that is the percentage of how much gains you actually captured on that move out of the possible amount favorable.\r\n\r\nSo with these parameters and a 1:1 system that you're trading, say that you enter a trade with a risk of 2 points and exit 10 minutes later when you hit your target of 2 points to make the 1:1. You would watch for an additional 10 minutes and maybe the price would have gone to 4 points profit before starting to have come back against you. The maximum favorable excursion in this case would be 4 points, so you essentially captured 50% of the potential in this particular trade scenario within this particular system.\r\n\r\nThen you're looking at averages. So if your 1:1 RR system on average leaves 50% of gains on the table (measuring how I described above over a very large sample size, which is necessary to make any statistical work valid) then that means that if you adjust your exit distance on average by 50% of initially planned then you should be maximizing that trade-off that I mentioned above (entry vs. confirmation). Make the adjustments to your system (in this case, a 50% increase in exit targets would mean you could adjust the system to a 1:1.5 and hit your same win% but increase the gains since you're maximizing based on averages) and then begin a new in-depth round of testing and analysis.\r\n\r\nSo with the numbers and system mentioned above, you could have taken the same 2 point risk trade but instead of exiting at 2 points you have the maximum favorable excursion averages statistical data as evidence that you could/should wait until 3 points to exit (because you know now that  on average you were leaving 50% on the table, and 3 points is 50% more than 2 points). Again, sometimes you'll miss out on those 4 point moves, but you'll also be consistently over the original 1:1 target, and working through this over time slowly maximizes your gains and minimizes how much you leave on the table, effectively nullifying the entry vs. confirmation slippage you might be encountering with an inefficient system.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1582754308.0, "tickers": []}

This alone is enough reason to go with IB because you can set up an institutional account and have sub accounts within it. Not only can you have multiple accounts for different people, you can also have multiple accounts for the same person but different trading strategies.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're just a simple US trader trading under your own name and not under a business structure, then you have more options. I'd still go with IB in this case.\r\n\r\nIB offers the cheapest margin. They offer a choice between low commissions or no commissions. They offer an account that can essentially act like a bank account (though Fidelity wins in this area, followed by Charles Schwab because of their zero fee ATM withdrawals).\r\n\r\nIB offers a lot of selection with order types, including algorithmic orders. Often these order types can get you better fills than you would otherwise get. You can set up pretty advanced orders within their platform.\r\n\r\nMaybe you don't need cheap margin and only need to use basic order types. In which case I'd still opt for IB. IB have good execution, which matter for just about every day trader. Pretty much anything that is offered by another broker is also offered by IB.\r\n\r\nThe downside of IB is that their platform has a high learning curve. There's another benefit of IB though: a lot of existing trading tools integrate already with IB. You don't like the TWS platform? That's okay, you can try out DAS Trader PRO (pretty much the gold standard when it comes to day trading platforms), NinjaTrader, MultiCharts, MotiveWave and many others.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may be cases where you may not want to use IB. If your strategy requires shorting penny stocks, for example. IB may not be the best choice if they don't have sufficient shares of what you want to short. So you can look for another broker who does have shares available to short. (Personally I've never encountered a situation where a stock I've wanted to short was not available on IB.)\r\n\r\nIB is really targeted towards active traders. eTrade, Fidelity, Charles Schwab and others can work well for trading, but they are targeted more towards passive investors.

I personally was using RSI to indicate that it's time to go counter to the trend (go short when it's overbought), but due to the momentum recently (intra-day on a one minute chart) it has been more productive to go WITH the trend for short periods. I was entering trades a RSI 70+ that would keep staying above 70 for long periods of time. Ultimately I'd make money, but it would take a while and I'd have to suck up losses for a minute until I got back to even when the RSI returned to \"normal\" levels and the price then allowed me to make money.\r\n\r\nWhat I noticed was when my RSI indicator would go off that it had hit 70 or 30, it would drop back below, then go above quickly, then do it again, and sometimes again before finally dropping down. Look at SPY on a one minute chart. Notice how many times it breaks 70, then retreats to like 60+ then goes above 70 again, and then does it again. There is no magic answer here, but I have seen anecdotally that 3 is the most common amount of times this happens. Then it turns down for a trip back to RSI 30 levels.\r\n\r\nSo I either wait for it to cross above 70 (or below 30) a few times before I go counter-trend OR I go with the trend, i.e. it hits 70+, I go long for a scalp on the way up. \r\n\r\nI have had a lot of time to watch SPY all day for the past few weeks and what came to be very apparent was when it gets on a run up or down, it stays there defying all the oscillators. Last 30 minutes on Friday was a perfect example. Breaks 70 around 3:15 after coming all the way from 20 then comes down to high 60s then back above 70 then below then above again all while still rising to a very bullish close. It would have been easy to think it was way overbought and ran up way too quick, but you would have been wrong.\r\n\r\nOn a 5-min chart or more the RSI is much more predictive but still it can stay above 70 or below 30 for a while.

Maybe the odds are a bit in your favor but you still gambling more than trading. Some things maybe turn this to less of a gamble (good news / bad news, very high volume on low float eta). Sometimes I’ll take a posting in the “first” entry but it would be small and speculative. I did it today with BOSC even thou it didn’t met my requirements I took a small position thinking on market open it will bounce a bit. Which it did. But I didn’t gain a lot , on the other hand I didn’t lose. If it was coming lower at market open I would lose maybe $20 and I gained $160. Nothing to big. Just a small speculative position.\r\n\r\nThe second entry is at the confirmation. Which means you got your system a confirmation signal and then entered. The down side is you have to let some of the potential gains go. The upper side is that you know it’s already playing your way and you just swoop in the meat of the move. \r\n\r\nSo if you think a stock will go down because it’s already 120% it doesn’t necessarily true.

I've found mixed results so far (I attribute this mainly to learning and trying out different strategies to find what I think will work best for me), but have been on the profitable side of things all throughout. \r\n\r\nI figured this thread would be a good place to ask a couple of questions seeing how there are people here actively trading minis (ES/NQ etc.). I've found that you tend to get a resounding negative feedback loop looking up the prospect of trading futures online (obviously there are exceptions, but these often look like hoaxes).  Through my experimentation thus far I've found that if you never move your stop losses and accept the beats that come you aren't going to get blown up like people tend to insinuate.  Don't get me wrong I've messed around with the stop losses when starting out...and quickly learned that this is not the way to go. Even with paper money taking a big loss can feel like a punch to the gut.  But enough with the anecdotes, my questions are mainly:\r\n\r\n\\- what timeframe do you find provides you the most consistent positive results? (I've found that I tend to do best trading less on the 5 min timeframe mainly swing/momentum trading. I've tried scalp trading and although you get a higher success rate the risk/reward doesn't seem justified unless you're very skilled.)\r\n\r\n\\- What indicators do you like to use?  (I've found the most success with volume, MACD, and an oscillator (I use awesome oscillator) with a 21 day EMA)\r\n\r\n\\- How do you like to trade and how do you like to structure you buy/sells (ie. how many contracts do you trade at once, do you simply scalp 1 point, do you swing trade for say 4 pts, etc.)\r\n\r\n\\- the last question I have is do you think it's possible to get consistent results (obviously some days you lose, some days you win) but if you maintain say a 60% win rate (which would apply to swing traders rather then scalpers of course who are shooting for 80% + win rate)\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read this beast and providing any insights that you might have.

However, their online StreetSmart Central site works pretty well, but I have to be at a computer.  If I could have TW’s analysis and probability UI, combined with ToS’ extensive and polished features and combines with Schwab’s order execution, I’d be in heaven.  \r\n\r\nCoolest feature to me so far on SSE is the Walk Limit.  Huge time saver for four leg option orders with a larger overall bid ask spread.  Just set the start, end, increments, the time per increment and forget it while I move on the next trade instead of having to manually walk more order.  I’m sure I’ll like SSE more as I force myself to get more familiar with it.  However, I find myself referring to ToS and TW constantly for stuff I either can’t find or just don’t know how to use yet in SSE.

However, I think they’re able to because the retain more payment for option trading order flow (PFOF) than any of the big brokers I researched.  I think this could also be why they don’t execute orders as well at market open open as well.  It might be that their routing algorithm is looking trying to balance PFOF from their 5 wholesale market makers with best execution, which is probably difficult to do well those first few minutes at market open. They initially came down to $.45 per contract, and I recently got them down to $.40. My goal is to get them down to $.30-$.35.  \r\nWith Schwab, they only came down to $.50 initially. However, their documentation makes it 100% clear that their routing algorithm searches for the best execution for the client above all else with no regard to PFOF amount.  In fact, it appears their agreements for PFOF with their 6 wholesale market makers is for a similar amount per contract across the board, which helps me believe this claim.   Schwab keeps less PFOF (leaving the trader more for price improvement) and I believe they may get fills occasionally when I can’t with ToS.

I’m a Finance major, so I know more than your average person on fundamental analysis which is often used for longer term investments. I wanted to fully dedicate myself to one thing but I was worried that the amount of money I’d spent paying my trading mentor would end up being a scam. On the other hand I was worried the time I’d spend focusing on my studies in school wouldn’t make me a lot of money or even land me my dream job. A lot of traders will make the argument that trading isn’t impossible, it just takes a long time and a certain mindset. Which I completely agree with, but I also think those who do it well and consistently are 1 in 1,000,000. The success rate actually is somewhere around 7% which is EXTREMELY low. I think what finally was the tipping point for me was when I was learning about how to follow “smart money” as my newest ticket to salvation and realizing “smart money” isn’t really “smart money”. Smart money is taking nearly risk free trades, and charging people management fee’s to make trades on somebody else’s behalf. It was at this point that I realized that day traders have every single possible force in the market playing against them. If you can overcome those forces, than good for you.

So forget about an exact entry and exit; you'll get slaughtered. \r\n\r\nYou don't miss these trades because of getting the news late. The move is already going when the news arrives; the smart money has programs in place to take advantage of the initial moves without the need to read the news. An individual cannot compete with the smart money, but you can shadow them.\r\n\r\nThese are higher risk plays and you can get lucky, but understand that it is luck. A skill move would be to scalp 1/4 points after watching the movement for awhile. If you're good at this, you can have fun. But there will be other stocks to trade that day that provide a more consistent return on your efforts and have identifiable setups.

Enter at your own risk. \r\n\r\nNo one knew at 11:30 AM that SRNE would go to 9.00 from 4.60. How would you know that was an entry point if you just arrived at the chart then?  If your scanner had picked SRNE up pre-market and you saw the double tap as a trend reversal, you could have gotten in a little above 4 and rode it for a full point. From there, it gets more nerve wracking. \r\n\r\nCover the chart to the right of where you think you might have entered the trade, slowly revealing the movement minute by minute, until the price falls in a large way at 10:10 or 15. What do you know then? How do you manage your position then? Where do you place your stops? What profit is enough to make your day, based on all that you know at that point in time and with your current skill level?\r\n\r\nIt's a useful exercise to look at a completed chart and think about how you could make more money from the movement, and then adjust your scanners and your stops and your size and etc. But it's never very useful to talk yourself into believing you *could* have take the entire move.

I actively traded the stock (getting in & out) buying after breakouts & selling before they hit whole numbers as that’s where most decide to sell or set stop losses. Whole numbers & the 0.50s ($1.50,2.50,3.50) makes perfect for profit takers & market makers who want to sell large block orders or exercise stop hunting.\r\n\r\nFew examples of my trades with $SRNE, a mixture of scalp trading & active trading :\r\n\r\n- in at $5.43 out at $5.75\r\n- in at $6.62 out at $6.86\r\n- in at $7.64 out at $8.92\r\n\r\nI use the RSI, volume, & price action to determine my entry & exits. Once I saw major resistance at $9, RSI stochastic indicated overbought, & MACD indicated a divergence to a bearish trajectory, I knew it was likely heading down once the major players started selling. Selling major block trades by profit takers & market makers triggers a chain of consecutive events of further selling by everyone else until return to a level of major support or return to baseline so I know NOT to buy any further or switch to a short position. \r\n\r\nIt would have been nice buying in at the breakout of $5.30 & riding it to $9 but who can actually predict the bottom & top? Trailing stop losses are nice way of riding to the top; HOWEVER if the security has very high volatility & volume, large variation in price via block trading & stop hunting (market manipulation) are probable. $SRNE was trading at over 80x it’s average volume at 500.2 million so I figured I’d rather scalp & active trade from past experience for a stock like this.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1589660191.0, "tickers": [["SRNE", 2], ["RSI", 1]]}

One candle on top of the last candle, nice and neat, all the way up. That raised one red flag. \r\n\r\nThen it gave up some distance to profit taking right before the bell. That usually tells me the first few bars will be up, because the mass of retail traders are licking their chops, thinking they're getting a good price at the open. This was a green flag for the first few minutes as a high value, high probability scalp.\r\n\r\nThe third minute after the open was the high volume mark for the pre-market trend. Some call this the orgasm. That was the second red flag. It was now more probably that the trend was spent and would reverse downward.\r\n\r\nThe strongest long play was that first three minutes; go long at the open with a stop loss that fits the candle ranges and take half a point to a full point. Nothing in the 1, 2 or 5 minute charts after that looked like anything but a downtrend continuation, which is kinda expected when a 2.25 stock gaps up to 6; that's potentially really overextended. \r\n\r\nThe initial adrenaline in the market opening won't last very long most of the time, so take a chunk of that first move and then sit on your thumbs and watch. Most of the time, the trend for the day will be back down. None of the little up moves showed confirmation for a reversal. They were just consolidating within a half point range, then back downward it went. \r\n\r\nConfirmation for a reversal would have had a higher high and higher low, combined with a clear candle pattern (doji, 3 bar play, bullish engulfing candle), and higher volume. The candles at 11:00 seemed like a higher low, and it did climb almost half a point from there. But, the candle pattern at the bottom, an inverted hammer, didn't give me confidence. I scalped a tiny bit but didn't trust that this was a reversal. The downtrend continued.\r\n\r\nAt 11:38 it seemed like the downtrend had its orgasm; a spike in volume, a bottoming tail, doji next candle. But the doji got taken out by an engulfing bearish candle, so no confirmation of a reversal again.\r\n\r\nConsider the range of this stock's wiggles today; it was like every candle was a quarter to a half a point in the early morning. I got stopped out trying to scalp on the peekaboo retracements. Changed my SL and got two small scalps on those retracements. Not really worth the attention I gave it, but it was good practice. \r\n\r\nWhen every candle is moving this far, be extra cautious. Your eye is probably used to candles for penny stocks moving a tenth or an eighth, and a half is normally seen as a really substantial move in one minute, worthy of being called a buy signal. This was not the case for PHIO today. It probably seduced you in because your brain was misinterpreting the move. Add the question, \"what's the candle range?\", to your checklist for your setups.

The only thing that moves a price short term is more buyers entering or leaving the market. Lots of things can encourage those buyers to come or go, but technical analysis is all about determining when they are there.\r\n\r\nOne more tidbit: This stock trades like 300,000 shares per day. It's daily trading range is like a nickle. There are many more profitable stocks for us to trade than this sleeping dog. Stocks that are easier and faster to get in and out of. This one won't show up in a lot of scans for that reason. There are higher probability trades available.\r\n\r\nNot saying its pipeline isn't wonderful. Not saying it won't improve the world some day. But that's not what day trading is about. Or swing trading. That's the turf of investing.\r\n\r\nNow about that fantasy: the most difficult thing to predict about biotech stocks IMO is the competition. \r\n\r\nThe reason these penny stocks are easier to pump and dump is you can create a compelling story about a small, struggling company, just like you did in your post. I'm not saying you're trying to pump the stock, although your tone fits that profile. I'm taking your questions on face value with no conspiracy implied or assumed.\r\n\r\nHere's one example: biotech 123 is working on a vaccine for malaria that can save millions of lives per year, mostly children. Biotech 456 is working on something entirely different. It's a bacterial infection given to mosquitoes that makes the mosquito immune to the malaria parasite. Both have compelling stories and would probably be good short term trades when the news comes out of their early clinical results. But long term? Which one will win over the market and make the other one irrelevant? Nobody knows.\r\n\r\nbiotech is hard to do. And after you do it, you have to carve out a niche in the market, which can also be very hard to do. A good story does not equal a successful company, not always.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1591230026.0, "tickers": []}

What is useful to know is that pre-market is setting something up for the opening. \r\n\r\nIf your charts can show you the pre-market action, take a look at 7:00 AM. You'll see the price going up a dime, down a dime, then rising to the high of the pre-mkt 1.67. Then it does what tired mountain climbers do and jogs back down to 1.50 to rest. \r\n\r\nBut look at 8:00 sharp. Look at the volume. Really good volume anyway right up to this point and them Bam!  ~1.5 million shares? Who do you think owns 1.5 million shares to sell and buy? That's institutional action. And you can't tell if they were taking profits or getting ready for the anticipated bull run.\r\n\r\n15 minutes later we retest the low for the pre-mkt. We casually go up. An hour later we retest the low again. Now the ups and downs are more urgent as traders set themselves up on a stock that's hard to borrow, so shorting may be difficult after the bell. \r\n\r\nThe bell goes off, the price opens at the top of the trend in pre-mkt and sells off fast. This is typical, even when the stock eventually, like in under 3 minutes, continues back up. There's more often than not some profit taking by those who were long the stock the day before because it gapped up. That selling en masse is what causes the drop.\r\n\r\nIf you put a 21 period exponential moving average on the chart, it will help you see the trend from pre-mkt to open session; it's down. You bought into a downtrend. The only question then is what was your stop loss to protect your capital.\r\n\r\nFurther on, at 10:30, you'll see a climactic after a bunch of other red candles. Often times, that signals the end of the downtrend. That's not to say it's a reversal, as you can see by the rest of the day. But the bears stroked it until it shot that big red one and they were done. You can see bargain hunters and traders with short positions covering in the next green candle. No news. No catalyst. Just normal trader behavior.\r\n\r\nSweet, eh? I hope this lesson didn't cost you your account.

Others, it is rainy and stormy, so you decide to wait for another day and don't leave your house. And sometimes, the storm sneaks up on you while you are at the beach. In that scenario, some people check the weather ahead of time, and decide not to go. Others still go, but leave ahead of time before the storm. Others are there right as the storm hits. Most run for there car to leave, while a few are just asleep, and don't realize there is a storm till it starts raining on them. Those who are faster, or have a GPS are able to leave in get home faster, while those who are slower get stuck and traffic, and end up not getting home in time to beat the rain.\r\n\r\nMy point is with this analogy is that most traders use there knowledge of proper entry and exit strategies to determine if a day is even viable to trade, or if there knowledge of dealing with certain patterns is not extensive enough.", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1592965734.0, "tickers": [["GPS", 1]]}

{"submission_name": "t3_hgvw1w", "id": "fw6fsbh", "text": "You have a lot of stuff on there, but can you prove to yourself that they all... \"work\"? Like what is your criteria for including some of those indicators other than \"using them, I have made money sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nHere's my take: whatever signals you think you're getting might as well just be random. Right now, your system has a negative expectancy since you're losing money, that's pretty obvious since it's based on the past but it's made double-worse since the expectancy is a type of inference about future events, so basically since you're losing money now you can expect to keep losing money in the future. I understand that's kind of a head-scratcher since past results shouldn't determine future performance, right? But if you couldn't prove to yourself before you started trading your system with all its indicators that the indicators would somehow help (with the aid of perfect execution and discipline as well) *generate a positive expectancy*, why would you assume they would naturally? The natural movements of something so complex as the markets are probably *mostly* random anyway that just by jumping in without proof otherwise you should just *assume* that you're taking random signals and trading randomly in a random environment. A coin flip's expectancy is zero, which means on average over time you'll always equalize the number of heads and tails distributed in a system, and although it could take thousands of flips, this represents essentially the aspect of randomness that traders face, especially when it's systematic and quantitative (indicators or even algorithms), as every trade (mostly) in a system will be marked as  a winner or loser, with various degrees of risk thrown on and slippage incurred and all sorts of suction at your equity. Kind of an easy way to think of randomness in the markets is that if you just were to approach any market and, without indicators, call whether it's going up or down a point or whatever and thus you win or lose, that's basically a heads or tails scenario and therefore essentially random. In simple coin flips the expectancy equalizes over time to zero, but in trading the expectancy is negative by default because we pay commissions and slippage in a mostly random environment. You have to grasp the market's inherent tendency to behave more randomly than otherwise, and this is a super-simplified way of explaining things (a coin flip's probabilities are static whereas the market is undergoing so many competing influences at all times that the probabilities are always shifting), it gets real complex when you start trying to quantify the \"signals\" from indicators in pure numbers (that's all indicators are anyway, mathematical representations of past data, which you could read as a spreadsheet and get the same information out of).\r\n\r\nSo you have to prove that those things you use have value to the bottom line, which means they help you weed out the moments when the probabilities in the market have shifted ever-so-slightly that you have a better-than-a coin-flip's chance that what you want to see happen will happen. Back-testing will get you part of the way there, but it gets real messy when volatility regimes are shifting. Forward-testing on small size will reveal whether your system has an edge or not.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1593275165.0, "tickers": []}

{"submission_name": "t3_hi7vxr", "id": "fwewa66", "text": "OK I am in the same boat as you.  I am daytrading for the first time although I have nearly two decades trading experience.  I also am only trading only one product (SPX) and over the last few weeks I have asked myself \"what the f is wrong with me\" multiple times (I let a $6000 day turn into a $3000 day last week, for one example).  I think I have finally settled into a groove although there will no doubt be more speed bumps.\r\n\r\nFirst thing is, unless it's the basis of your strategy, I wouldn't trade pullbacks.  It's just asking to get run over.  Once you decide the day's direction, only trade in that direction.  The reason is that if your timing is off, you will get \"saved\" by the overall trend.  Whereas if you are trading against the trend you will never get that benefit of the doubt.  And you will get sucked into a loop where it keeps looking like it will come back in your favor, and then snaps the other way even worse.  over and over.\r\n\r\nSecond thing is you need to withdraw that cash now or you are going to lose it.  Trade with like 10 grand until you find a groove then slowly raise it up.  Or your education will cost way more than it is worth.  I'm not telling you to paper trade, I think you should have real money on the line.  Just not that much.  As an additional bonus, with less money on the line trading will become easier because it will be less emotional and you won't be asking yourself what the f is wrong with me.  (hint: you are trading too big)\r\n\r\nThird thing you need to do is stop when you are down $1000 for the day and just take a time out for a few minutes or even the rest of the day.  You can sense when you are sucking so just stop.  You need to form the habit of stopping now.  Even if it costs you in the short run, the habit will be worth more in the long run.\r\n\r\nLast is you need to create some rules for yourself.  It might take you a couple weeks to start sticking to them but the sooner you start the better.  One of mine is to be out by lunchtime no matter what.  I am having a real tough time with that one.  Today was a good example.  I was long and knew it was going higher but sold anyway because of the rule.  It finally settled higher in the last 5 minutes, but I am so ok with that.  Because it trended down most of the afternoon and easily could have retraced the entire day.  I find that the longer I go in the day the worse I get so that's one of my rules.  You need your own for sure!  Even if they are arbitrary, you need to get into the habit of doing it anyway.  I hope that makes sense.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I do plan on breaking this rule if we get a day with limit downs and vix over 50, but at least I am planning that in advance and not going to just do it blindly when that day comes.  This will allow me to think about and plan around how to navigate that, before it actually happens.  And psychologically, I won't try to break my own rule every single day because I have already set out when it would be broken.  I hope all of this helps.\r\n\r\nGood luck from one loser to another!", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1593468551.0, "tickers": []}

The very best advice I can give is to, first and foremost, establish a good risk management plan. For example, my trading software will reject any orders and close out open positions after I reach my set max daily loss. Zooming in, I have a fixed dollar amount risk per trade and have stop orders set accordingly and I follow my rules (no moving stops, proper position sizing, no changing max loss settings). Shorting volatile stocks can net you some winners, but you’ll be amazed at how quickly such a position can run against you if there is a squeeze. Also, I hear some sentiment of using fundamental analysis in your post (“winners in my book”, “BLNK looks good long term”). That’s not day trading and relying of fundamentals, beyond just knowing what’s going on as a catalyst for a stock, is a great way to get your face ripped off. Learn to trade the price action, not the fundamentals, and you will build a skill that is applicable to all markets in all timeframes. Neither investing nor swing trading is day trading and a lot of people don’t understand the differences enough to keep themselves out of trouble. Figure out which one you want to pursue and then learn that specific discipline. I went through this same progression: investing, to swing trading, and to now day trading, with lucky early results in the latter distorting my perception of the skills required to be successful. Make sure you are constantly working to uncover what you don’t know while protecting yourself from blowing up your account in the process and you’ll be fine.", "score": 9, "created_utc": 1594085961.0, "tickers": []}

If everyone was a short term scalper patterns would still emerge because most people would have patterns in their behavior that would create patterns in the market.  \r\n\r\nTrading is very fractal in nature so what appears on the lower time frames will appear on the higher time frames. \r\n\r\nAsking if patterns are bullish or bearish the answer is yes.  It's like asking if a single sentence is positive or negative, it depends on the context.  If you get a doji candle out of nowhere in a sideways market it probably isn't going to mean much however if you get one after a long uptrend or downtrend it might be time to pay attention.\r\n\r\nThink of it like this the phrase \" a million dollars\"\r\n\r\nIt's a neutral statement.\r\n\r\nIf i say I'm giving you a million dollars that's a pretty bullish statement.\r\n\r\nIf you blew up your account and you owe the brokerage house a million dollars that's definitely a bearish statement.\r\n\r\nA million dollars is the pattern and it's up to you to read it in context.\r\n\r\nTL;DR patterns work because humans like patterns but only in certain situations.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1594799317.0, "tickers": []}
{"submission_name": "t3_hrj53j", "id": "fy583mn", "text": "Good question. The truth is that most people have a fundamental misunderstanding when it comes to what \"patterns\" in the market are. They assume these patterns are things like \"head and shoulders\", \"flags\", \"double tops\" etc. The problem is that they try and identify these opportunities by just looking at the heuristic of a chart. The chart is a *representation* of the market, but the market itself is the dynamic price action combined with static market structure, and is an entity that needs to be represented somehow in some way but understanding this aspect of *representation* is critical. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n> **why are there patterns in stocks?** \r\n\r\nThe truth, cognitively speaking, is that humans will find patterns is most anything. Whether or not those patterns are *truly* there is a different story and requires a much different set of tools to detect. The same applies to financial markets. People will see all sorts of \"patterns\" in the markets, but the kicker is that the **vast** majority are not *true* patterns in this specific sense (must be repeatably exploitable into the future with a reliable degree of certainty). Once you flip your thinking to the other way around: seeing that most of the \"patterns\" that pop out at you as illusions instead of being real, you will start to suspect the true nature of the game.\r\n\r\n\"Patterns\" as a general term is also extremely vague, and it seems that in your post you might be referencing the classic \"named\" patterns I listed a few of up above. Learning about these patterns is where most beginners will probably stop, because they assume that this is real solid work they are learning about, when it's anything but. You could take each of those named ones and extract information about the raw price and it's mathematical qualities that make it \"behave\" like that. The chart has nothing to do with it but most people who learn these \"patterns\" by a chart have no idea how this \"pattern\" would like in a raw price data spreadsheet. It's all just numbers.\r\n\r\nThe other side of the coin to patterns is the idea of randomness, and this is the lynch-pin that ties everything I've said up together: the vast majority of market data might as well be random when you assess it's price and data's behavior. On shorter time-frames you can have deviations from the mean but after a while the market will try and find it's equilibrium. Here is the reason why a trader can't just trade the patterns they see on a chart: patterns occur even in random data, randomly! This is the danger of simplifying an approach to detect potential patterns.\r\n\r\nSo what are the *real* patterns in the market? It's where real imbalances underlying buying and selling pressure in a probabilistic positively expectant (a very specific term) way that *on average* yields *slightly better* odds of playing out than a purely random event (so a little bit of an edge on a coin flip). A real head and shoulders pattern will form on real imbalance in the market dynamics but it will probably look very similar to a head and shoulders that appears randomly and should be avoided. All efforts of the proper technical analyst goes back to learning how to differentiate between the potentially real and the probably fake.\r\n\r\nPsychology does factor into patterns. Imagine you buy at the high of the day but it immediately reverses and sells back below the level you were watching. You're now one of those \"trapped\" traders who went long at the high. Your psychology right now when you're in loss could be in panic (most people are at this point). You just entered and it immediately went against you. What do you do? A lot of people would sell their positions to cut the loss, which deepens the turn against the highs you entered at. A reversal at new highs is a potential Failure Test, where the price failed trying to get to new levels. This is a potential true pattern that deals with the psychological makeup of the participants because you can easily see in my simple example how people who bought at the top might panic and sell when there was a reversal against them, and this might be repeatably exploitable into the future. The psychology of the crowd, and what kind of predictive edge you might be able to exploit, is what probably causes patterns in the markets.\r\n\r\nOne last tidbit occurred to me until trying to think about the questions you were asking. A lot of people assume that patterns work because so many people see them then self-fulfill their promises... I guess? It seems to me that the opposite might be true, which might be counter-intuitive at first. The markets are a highly competitive, and potentially adaptive, environment where the sole element of success is having a demonstrable edge. People think classic chart patterns \"work\" because \"everyone\" sees them. I would argue that this actually causes these to work *less* because of the competitive aspect of exploiting an edge. An edge in the context of a huge an seemingly random environment in the markets is a super tiny chance that you're acting on a better-than-random chance (a true pattern!), but over time as more people look to exploit those same edges then those opportunities will erode, or kind of get swallowed up in the vacuum of randomness before they can emerge again.\r\n\r\nAs far as your bonus question: potential patterns occur everywhere in every time-frame (true patterns much much less often), but the danger of zooming in on timeframe is that you're now looking at ***way*** more data points, and with that comes much more danger of noisiness in the data, making it essentially random and harder to sift through.\r\n\r\nI like thinking about this stuff, so feel free to hit me back about any of it.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1594821839.0, "tickers": []}

After 2 yrs  of rotations through equities, fixed income, commodities and forex the firm placed you at a desk where they thought you were best suited. \r\n\r\nEveryone they flew to NYC were from the top colleges with the best grades, it's not intelligence and a work ethic BUT the soft skills that will enable you to be a profitable trader. As you read through reddit how many times have you read about individuals going parabolic and turning 5k into 100k etc and then blowing up their accounts. They lacked the soft skills to maintain awareness, discipline and focus. Good luck", "score": 11, "created_utc": 1595163013.0, "tickers": [["NYC", 2]]}

{"submission_name": "t3_i4c5lh", "id": "g0hom7s", "text": "Al Brooks talks about the traders equation: \r\nprobability_success * reward > probability_failure * risk\r\nAnd how winning trades need the positive trader's equation. BUT, he will always mention how there are no perfect trades, since institutions and HFT algos run the market basically, and so it's mathematically fair to assume it will be one of those taking the other side of the trade on every trade, so if you were to enter a perfect trade, a institution would have to enter on a surely losing trade and that just won't happen. Also, an HFT buying from another HFT when one of them will surely lose also doesn't happen. Based on that you always have to give something in return: maybe you're going for a trade you're pretty certain will work, and Al says all this certainty in the market is usually just about 60% and if you believe you're more certain than that, you're liked mistaken. So say you're going for a 60% prob trade with a 1:1 R:R, the institution taking the other part might be entering on a 40% probability trade, but in their case they will have a 2:1 R:R or more, so you gave R:R in return of probability, and the insititution the inverse.\r\n\r\nThe thing is the market is very efficient, so whenever it is very unbalanced to another side (making it extremely high probability, like 80%), it goes REALLY fast, which is exactly why it happens, because beginners don't see it or can't trade these situations, which are usually fast, growing breakout spikes - the spike is growing and beginners were first scared and not sure if the breakout would be sucessful, and then as the spike grows the risk get's too big and they want to wait for a pullback. The thing is, the risk grows, but in return you're getting probability - it's literally a really strong breakout and thus expect prices to go higher and institutions are entering at the market because they know probability is on their side. It's a whole different story to actually trade these things rather than just talk about them, of course!\r\n\r\nBasically, the point was just to say that yes, you can have moments of very high probability and great R:R in trading, though most part of the time chances are you don't have such a high probability and just a 1:1 R:R at best, and sometimes you might have good trades with probability lower than 50% but better R:R, that's how the whole game works!\r\n\r\nOf course Al brooks himself will explain everything much better and into more detail, I'd recommend looking up about the Traders Equation and finding some of his content on it. He covers that on his 2nd book of the trilogy, the Trading Ranges book, where he will also mention the concepts of directional probability and etc that are very helpful to see things clearer in the gray sea of uncertainty that is the market.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1596663208.0, "tickers": []}

We all like to win and often measure our own self worth by our win rate. This means that losses sting us emotionally, so we avoid that pain by either cutting winners early or letting losers run in the hopes that they come back in our favor. A few things that have helped me in this area:\r\n\r\n1. Use hard stops, or, if you can’t, pick a mental stop and just make it deterministic - if price hits that level, click the button immediately and get out.\r\n2. The pain of taking these stops will hurt. If that pain builds too much, just step away and go reset. This can be a 5 minute coffee break, reading/relaxing/mediating, whatever. Come back to trade only once that pain has subsided at least a little bit.\r\n3. If you haven’t read it, I’d highly recommend Trading In The Zone. That book helped me more than any other trading resource when I was at my lowest regarding pain from losses.\r\n\r\nAs you take more stop outs and become more introspective about the emotional pain they cause, you’ll be able to more effectively manage that pain. This will cause you to make better trades, which will result in less overall pain to the point where you’ll be able to brush off a losing trade quickly and easily and move on to the next trade without the baggage. The irony is that this will drive your win rate higher than artificially padding it with bad habits. It isn’t easy, but this ability to accept losses/pain with detachment and make a good, unemotional trade on the next opportunity is the hallmark of all great traders.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1596642881.0, "tickers": []}

I've been following him for a couple months, and now I'm starting to use the watchlists more to day trade. I save that as a watchlist in TOS and will monitor for any favorable moves. I also watch Stock Market Today by TraderTV- they're a group of excited Canadian traders who livestream from 9AM-12PM EST every trading day. Even though some of the reaction buzzers are over the top, I like that they've set up their stream kind of like a news broadcast so you can easily see the positions they're taking. Plus, they have a guy who reports market moves and news- nice for identifying potential stocks to play in real time. I feel like with this combination, I essentially have a setup similar to the trading memberships that some traders tout.\r\n\r\nI know there's quite a few live trading channels on YouTube, and I do eventually want to check out some other ones.

Repeatedly, even during a drawdown. \"Psychology\" is what allows your edge to play out over the number of trades required for it to be profitable. Without being mentally stable and confident in what you're doing, you'd never give your edge the chance to prove itself as an edge. Psychology is knowing that, despite our natural human condition, an edge is not reflected in a small series but in a very large one. That's very hard for humans to grasp, as our society has conditioned us to believe that negative responses/feedback are the reflection of something that we're doing wrong.\r\n\r\nSo I think the issue here is a lack of understanding, or absence of a proper definition, of what \"psychology\" means when it comes to trading. I don't think finding an edge is as difficult as allowing it to work, when you receive instant painful feedback that the said edge is not working (as fast as we believe edges should work).\r\n\r\n This is all uncomfortable and unconscious, even if we tell ourselves that we're aware of it and okay with it.

Several consecutive red candles, tanking through and under the VWAP and BBands, followed by a healthy pullback to test both the VWAP and the BBands on the downside of the two. That’s the first signal, the second is that there was two tweezer top candles when price kept testing the two studies when it retraced from a downtrend (see how that second green never made a new high, it tested the previous candles high down to the cent); you entered because price broke above, but you jumped the gun on confirmation. \r\n\r\nSee to avoid getting flushed out like that, you cannot counter trend trade, this was simply identified by 3 things mentioned above that validated a bias towards the downside. You went long too early, yuh should’ve waited for that second green candle above the VWAP and BBands to make a new high (two green tweezer tops), or even close at a new high, then enter. \r\n\r\nI’d ignore the two lower studies (RSI, MACD), especially if you’re not quite fully educated on how they work and how to maximize them. I’m suggesting this because indicators only indicate, and you can’t let them dictate. But aside from this, the MACD was bearish too and the signal line never crossed in a bullish manor to signal uptrend. \r\n\r\nFor the RSI, it’s also fairly bearish; it’s close to testing the oversold threshold past 70, looks like it peaked at 65. That would signal that it’s close to being overextended and the pullback (mentioned above) of the downtrend has been exhausted. I would invest some more time into learning everything you can about indicators and studies on charts and sub graphs so you don’t misinterpret the data being displayed which inevitably causes contrasting price action biases and it’s harder for a trader to predict which way the price will go.

For example, if you wanted to risk $150 on a $10 entry and your stop loss was say $9.75, you are risking .25 cents per share. So $150/.25 = 600 which means to risk $150 on a trade that you enter at $10 you need to purchase 600 shares. Having a higher account balance just helps you get in on larger positions. The risk amount will dictate the shares if I understand you correctly. On this example if you’d shoot for a 1:2 (risk/reward) you’d try and exit at 10.50 so you’d make $300 off of the risk of $150. \r\n\r\nQuick example to check. If you wanted to do the same but use your capital on a higher priced stock you could buy a $300 stock and risk say $5. So your stop is at $295.

There are very few things that surprise me because it's already happened to me or I've already screwed it up before so I don't get frustrated or lose my cool.\r\n\r\nSo my point is this, any time I screw something up I think its just an inevitable stepping stone to getting really good at whatever it is I'm trying to do (in this case trading) and if I didn't do it now I'd have to do it eventually otherwise I wouldn't be at the level of badassery that I require. If I thought I couldn't be one of the top 20% of amateur traders in the nation I wouldn't waste my time and money learning it right now and there's a lot of mistakes coming before I can comfortably be happy with that title even if I get to where my win % or profitability or whatever metric would you arbitrarily choose would suggest I had made it. Also, this is not an actual goal of mine I just want to be confident in the fact that I am really, really good a trading one day like I am with bartending.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1597732632.0, "tickers": []}

If you're going for a R:R of 1:1 that means you're aiming for $400 winners too.\r\n\r\nWith fast scalps out of whole/half dollar breaks I think a 1:1 R:R is reasonable, because those pops are usually quite modest (but consistent).\r\n\r\n8-10 cents is quite typical. That's where the \"pop scalpers\" cash out and the price drops again. It's a toss up what happens after that, which is why those 10c pops are what you aim for.\r\n\r\nSo with a 1:1 risk to reward that means your stop is also 10 cents. Depending on the stock that may be a bit tight, so it takes some experimenting with certain stop sizes. Maybe 15 cents works better. So if you aim for the break at $5, you stop out at $4.85 (profit at $5.15).\r\n\r\nMore expensive stocks usually have bigger pops, but volume plays a huge role too.\r\n\r\nFinally, your position size follows from your risk ($400) divided by your stop distance. So in case of a 15c stop, you take 400 / 0.15 = 2666 shares. Maybe round it to 2500.\r\n\r\nOf course you can aim for a 2:1 profit:loss, which means you aim for twice the pop (20-30 cents) compared to your stop. Rewards will be bigger, but you'll get stopped out more. It requires more buyers to step in after the fast scalpers take their profit. I learned that for me it works better to go for smaller profits, but taking the stop loss is most important. Especially on tight stops a big slippage hits hard.\r\n\r\nA hybrid strategy is to scale out half at the 10c pop ($200 profit) move your stop to break-even (or 1c under that dollar level) and see if the other half can ride up more.\r\n\r\nAs you notice, the amount of money you put in the trade is irrelevant, as long as you honour your stop level.

They have the drive and determination to juggle between trading and running aspects of a business, dealing with customers, etc. So they take that part of their income stream just as seriously as trading or any other job/business.

Honestly, in my experience, sometimes this kind of a loss serves as a good reminder and wake up call to stick to our risk management rules. Because let’s say for sake of argument that the trade worked out and the stock went up to $100 or something in the next minutes, you cashed out and you doubled Or tripled your account value right away.\r\n\r\nNow, by human nature, we become emboldened and think we can get away with this kind of thing again and again. So next time you may have put your entire newly minted 100k account at risk on something similar, and lose 90k instead of 5k. And that would’ve felt way worse than losing this 5.1k. So even though it sucks, it’s still a small enough chunk of your account to where it’s not the end of the account and you can continue to trade. Consider it a blessing to get the lesson with 5k and not the entire value of your account, and take heed for future. \r\n\r\nAnd also, while I personally try to have some kind of minimal criteria for stocks I trade, but if you’re going to trade no-name pump & dump stocks like this, you need to make sure your finger is on that sell button and you need to exit with a market order the second things ain’t going your way, no if’s ands or buts. You can re-enter it 20 times if you insist on trading it until/if it does what you think it should be doing, but each one of those 20 times, you better be ready for a swift exit, no questions asked (and be willing to accept whatever fill a market order gets you).

Hopefully it helps you but this is my setup for scalping.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI use a 13EMA (use to be 15) in  particular in deciding when to take a trade. I wait for a green candle  (I use heikin ashi candles) to form ABOVE the 13EMA to go into a trade  that I already wanted to but use that as my entry (This green bar that  I'm waiting to form above my EMA line is in relation to the previous  candles... no matter how green it seems to trend, I wait until its ABOVE  my EMA line) I use VWAP as a form of support / resistance.\r\n\r\nWhile  doing so, I always keep an eye on my Chaikin Money Flow indicator (Very  underrated indicator), which keeps me aware of whether or not I'm in a  bullish or bearish trend (Not 100% but works very well)\r\n\r\nIn  conjunction with these indicators I have MACD, which let me know the  MOMENTUM of the trend in which my trade is in (MACD allows me to know  the severity in which the rate of change  / momentum my trade is going)\r\n\r\nI  trade primarily the 1m, 5m and have 1hr open at all times (I have daily  to see overall view but do not focus much on it) I execute off of my 1m  chart. I always try to verify my execution in conjunction with a larger  time frame... ALWAYS. Whether that's with my 5m or 1h chart.\r\n\r\nPlease  note that I trade from a scalping point of view and that revolves  around price action, therefore my indicators revolve around PRICE (Which  in my honest opinion is tried and tested method for long term winnings)  If the chaikin indicator is above 0 - .20, I know im in a bullish trend  and can safely ride the green candles forming / vise versa if im in a  bearish trend. I can still safely take a trade if in a bearish trend  (below 0) but aware that a reversal is more of a probability to happen)\r\n\r\nI  don't go looking for MACD crossovers but I do keep an eye on it to  further solidify entries. I simply use MACD as a gauge of momentum as to  where my growth will accelerate / slow down (This is also good to watch  for seeing momentum of a bearish trend, which allows to to take an  entry once shown signs of decreasing bearish trend) My trades last  minutes but that can vary how much float / liquid the stock is.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1601323065.0, "tickers": []}

Frankly, I was hoping to see either, \"stick to the 9 to 5 until X (or forever)\" or \"this is definitely the way to go!\" So, was it the way to go? Did you make the right choice with the right timing? Can you see yourself doing this week in, week out, for decades to come?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. You strongly emphasize data analysis, and I love it. There are two halves to that, knowing WHAT works and knowing WHY it works. What are your thoughts on a strategy based on what without why?\r\n\r\n Contrived Silly Outsized Example: if I place order X at 10:02 with a certain OCO, it has a nearly 100% win rate with a Sharpe of 1.3 when backtested over 5 years. I don't really get why it works, but it apparently works.\r\n\r\nWould you trust the contrived example? Or no, because the WHY isn't analyzed and understood? (In other words, you can't precisely know the risk factors or what causes the small losing percentage.) To paraphrase, what are your thoughts on dart throwing / blind strategy selection ok if it apparently works?", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1601732924.0, "tickers": [["X", 2]]}

First is to understand the basics of the market, trade management (like how to place orders), risk management, trading psychology, and basic strategies. All of those things can be had through YouTube videos, books, etc., and it sounds like you already have a good start there.\r\n\r\nThe next thing, and these kind of go hand in hand, is to find a support community (chat room, mentor, etc) and start to look at the styles of different traders. Find someone who is actually trading for real and has demonstrated success and model their behavior. I joined a community with a variety of traders, each with different styles/strategies/approaches. Some were scalpers, some used patterns, some used volume, some swore by Fibonacci levels - most used an amalgamation of the preceding, but all of them were getting results. Find something that resonates with you and try it. I mean really try it, for a few weeks or even months, until you know if it is right for you. There was one trader whose style I absolutely loved and so I tried to emulate his approach for a few months. I wanted to trade just like him - effortless, having fun, making money absolutely every single day.\r\n\r\nThat’s when things got a bit dark, and this is what I consider the make or break moment for a trader. I couldn’t replicate his success. My dream was slipping away and it felt awful. Even on good days, I was stressed out about my trading. Through the pain and self reflection, I realized I needed to find another style/strategy.\r\n\r\nSo I started the same process over again. I looked again to seek out and model successful traders, but integrated what I learned about trading and myself into my new search for profitability. That’s when I realized, as countless others have said, that I needed a style that better fit my own personality. That’s what I’ve done and it has been exceptional. All of those characteristics of that the first trader‘s style - the ease, the fun, the success - came to me as soon as I found my next approach and that’s how I knew I had found “it.”\r\n\r\nIn closing, my opinion is that the reason it takes some people longer to become successful than others is because some are just better and/or more efficient at working through this process. The longer it takes, the more grit you need to eventually make it. You definitely don’t want to hop around from one strategy or style to the next, but if something really isn’t working and feels wrong, find something else that resonates better with you.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1602126551.0, "tickers": []}

So you bought your out the money put at that time which was roughly $2 otm at the time as you said, and you paid a premium price for it, because of the inflated IV.  Then as the day went on, IV cooled down, and even though the stock continued to bleed down, as you said your option lost value, or at least didn’t go up in value. Though not exact, but another simpler way to think of it is that there was a lot of ‘demand’ for that option when you bought it and it shot up the price of that option, and later as demand for that option cooled down, the price came down, even though the stock went in the direction you thought it would. \r\n\r\nYour thesis that GME could go down after that spike was correct, but your timing of purchasing the put was not the best. Also, as someone else said, it’s better to buy right at or itm in these situations if you can afford it, because then you at least build intrinsic value if the stock moves in your desired direction and it can help make up for some of the loss from things like IV crush and even theta decay.\r\n\r\nYour hope now is that GME continues going down and your $12 put goes enough itm to get you to breakeven and perhaps a profit by expiration. You said you paid $1.40 for the put, so your breakeven is if GME makes its way down to 10.60, and if it continues going down beyond that, that’s profit. Another thing which could be helpful in this trade would be that some more meme action occurs with GME in coming days which spikes up the IV on options and makes your option more valuable.

I aim to increase my account value by at least 1% each day - a target I hit around 80% of the time.\r\n\r\nI'm not a trader. I have been looking into it. I do play poker casually though, and this line bugs me. Does anything with volatility actually fit within neat boxes like this? With poker, you can try to hit some arbitrary number every day, but that's totally not how the nature of the game works. Volatility means lots of up and down motions. If there were no volatility, then you would have a much more difficult time making a gain or a loss.\r\n\r\nYou might hit your number, but you should never give up good conditions (a good table, whales having a good time bleeding cash, etc.) Maybe this isn't an issue in stocks, but in poker, you're shooting yourself in the foot by leaving good conditions early. In a favorable situation, you want to get in as much as your chips as you can, forget about stop losses, or setting a \"go home\" number. Unfavorable conditions are the norm, favorable conditions the exception. If you cut the good short, then the bad will overtake you. It's just a matter of time. You don't beat the game with a stable market and not much movement (a typical table with professional grinders.) You need some chaos which froths things up a bit.\r\n\r\nAlso, doesn't \"at least\" %1 each day describe a temporary situation? Again, I'm not a trader or even much of a math guy.

That’s potentially just a large player building size before a push. You can’t know unless you’re reading the story and taking in the context of what’s been happening and where you’re at within that profile. \r\n\r\nAre we seeing large players stepping in to push towards the edge of the range?

The Dom is however used by just about every professional interviewed on chat with traders, so what does that tell you?\r\n\r\nThe only way to learn the DOM is to watch it and record it. It’s so hard to follow at first. You need to absorb it, make theories and see if they play out and why they didn’t. Absolutely talk to others about it, but you need time more than anything else. \r\n\r\nLastly, if you want to learn the DOM. Learn it on something slow moving with a lot of liquidity first. It’s a lot harder reading ES and you can forget NQ,CL etc. \r\n\r\nI didn’t realise I wasn’t properly reading it till I traded the treasuries and had time for my brain to tell a story.

Most times from what I've found I'll draw my support/resistance in the indices and when vx trades its support I can then look to short indices and when vx trades its resistance I can then look to get long the indices. Keep in mind this is for day trading and primarily futures trading. If I'm looking for fade setups or reversals that is when I'll look at the $tick chart to see if we have made a high tick at highs(could be short reversal) in indices or low tick at lows in indices(could be long reversal). \r\n\r\nI hope this helps.

It's just my opinion and I have learned a ton. Do not rely on them to teach you...you have to be willing to read and learn through absorbing information over weeks, months, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Screen time - get lots of it! You need to be able to read charts, understand price action, and read level 2\r\n2. Chat rooms - im not going to call them pumpers because I've come to greatly respect what some of them do. IMO you need to be in a discord group or multiple of them to witness how they call out stocks. I'd recommend checking out the following free rooms: buysellshort, sapphire, atlas, cam's room (twitter is stocksthatgo). Cam annoys me though - he never knows what the hell is going on. Go into the trading floor in each discord group - not the chat where amateurs are talking. My strongest personal recommendation if I can only choose one is Atlas. \r\n3. Use the discord groups to learn and use it to your advantage. Instead of copying all the plays in the discord, look at why they called them in the first place.
