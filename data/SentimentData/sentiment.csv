"Big trades from today - and watches going into tomorrow
Hey guys - TSXtrad3r back with some more trade ideas and recaps. Nailed some big ones today, namely $PTDI. 

My initial entry at $5.01 was only 1/3 of my total size, keeping risk low, planned to take it off for a small loss if $4.90s broke again. I added a little more through $5.10 and then finally the rest through $5.20, at which point I was positive this would squeeze through $5.30 as shorts were starting to panic cover. I dont know what it was, just experience I guess, but I have never been so sure a squeeze was going to happen in my life. I bet big, it ripped and kept on ripping all the way to $7.50++. It was a seriously impressive move, and I sold a bit too early again, but the biggest win for me was seeing the signs of a squeeze, anticipating it before it happened, and getting long at a low avg price with LOW risk relative to reward on the trade and totally nailing the entry.

Heres everything from today and a little bit about my trading journey outlined here in my new blog!

Again, I hope you guys find this content useful, I got some good feedback from my videos, so I will be posting more in the near future. Good luck with your trading tomorrow, stay safe, stay focused, and stay disciplined :)

"Day trading McDonald's?
I've been doing stocks for a few years but not much day trading.  I was wondering is it common to ride a big public company that is pretty stable like McDonald's which swings 2% in either direction each day but stays pretty level.  If you had about $50k+ to play with would it be relatively safe to keep trading on +2% ups?

That's about $1000k profit - $14 in trades - 30% short term capital gains = roughly $686 profit each time (not including compounding for simplification).  I understand that sometimes one would have to wait 1-2 weeks to get back in the upswing but it looks like a pretty safe bet for me for making a little profit and I just wanted your thoughts from more experienced people.

"Stupid Noob Makes Stupid Mistake
Hey all

So i've been monitoring a company for months now called KOOVs (LSE:KOOV) I was watching them towards the start of the year and considering investing £10000 when shares where around 15.00. I lost interested in monitoring them and recently checked them to see their shares were over 50.00 each. DAMN

Anyway ive been monitoring them daily the past week and a half or so. 

I saw a quick rise in value this morning, around 10% in the first 20/30 minutes of trading. I ended up buying £10,000 worth at 61.4

Theyve since dropped to (as of writing) 59.05. Not ideal as i expected that growth to continue. They were sitting at 62 earlier and i tried selling them but Halifax kept putting me into a negotiated order so i didn't want to proceed, as i didnt know what price id get for them.

Im now around £450 down. Do i cut my losses and sell (seeing what a halifax negotiated order gives me) or should I hold onto them?

I dont need the money any time soon, i just dont want to lose any more than what its already devalued at.

Yes im a noob. Yes im stupid, but im here asking for advice if anyone would be able to offer it.

Thanks",0

"New (night?)-trader here, with a strategy theory that needs some honest critique
DISCLAIMER: Long post because if I only share parts of it, you're going to think I'm a veritable idiot. (also sorry if you've seen this elsewhere, I wasn't sure the best place to post)

I'm brand new to trading (like 3 days -- although I did use the 'best brokers' app for a while before I risked putting real money in the market). I have a ton of questions about things I'm learning, it's fascinating. But here's a strategy question I can't find online, and wanted some others opinions.

First, so we are all on the same page: I want to do day trading primarily. (not opposed to have 1-2 long term stock just harboring in the background, but I want something I can interact with and manipulate on a daily basis.) I also like that I can make a small profit in a short amount of time without having to keep my money in the market when I'm unable to monitor it. I know this is supposed to be riskier trading style, but I actually like the security of NOT keeping my money in a market I can't watch 24/7. I only really want it to be there when I'm able to watch it diligently and pull it out at an moments notice if need be. Plus, I like the daily involvement and strategy of it more than other types.

Here's my background: I'm about to graduate from medical school, and I don't have any 'buffer."" This is all entirely for experimentation and fun to see what I can do and it will most certainly be part time once I start residency (hence why I need to pull my money out daily and not worry about checking my trades in the middle of a surgery). Because I have doctor sized loans right now, I'm only able to do this thanks to the Robinhood app. I put in $40 as a Hanukkah gift for myself. :) I'm will never deposit more than $50-100 as a seasonal gift. So when it's gone, it's gone, until the next gift-giving holiday. That being said, I'd love to grow it into something that will put a little bit of play money in my pocket, and help me seriously tackle those loans early on.

In three days I've gotten my $40 up to $58, which I feel like is pretty good for never doing this before! But I've always been a diligent and careful student, and I'm not about to assume I know anything about what I'm doing. That's what I want your opinions for!

I currently put stops that don't allow me to loose more than $0.02 on any stock, and I'm using mostly penny stocks since I have such a low budget to work with (but I'm looking to move away from that asap). I did invest in 2 'longer term' stocks: $SQ and $GGB, but I may sell those in a few days, idk yet.

Using robinhood, I signed up for the margin account because w/ only $40 It was really frustrating to have to wait 3 days to be able to use the money from the stocks I sold. And as you know you aren't allowed to 'pattern day trade' as a result without a 25k minimum.

So here is my day/night trading strategy (really more like a theory at this point) as a work around that little issue. I used similar methods describe by all day traders (per google % youtube) to identify which stocks are most likely going to be hot the following day (news, chat rooms, expert opinion, etc.) and I invest in those as close to 4pm as possible. Unless of course there is a run to the bell, then I invest in that as soon as I see the trend. The following morning I immediately sell the stocks that rose significantly right before closing (or gained a gap in after hours), and watch the ones that I 'predicted' would be hits. I'm not greedy, and I sell as soon as I see signs that the trend is changing. This counts as 2 market days so I won't be flagged.

Obviously, it's going to be harder to identify which stocks are going to trend tomorrow morning because so much of the news comes in overnight, so there's obviously greater risk, which is part of why I chose to be so unforgiving in my parameter's when considering the trends of the chart.

What are your thoughts on this strategy? Has anyone done this successfully? (Small success is ok, I'm not looking for a new career here) Is there a giant area of potential failure that could slaughter me that it seems like I'm failing to consider here? Once/if I'm able to make enough, I'll likely switch to another broker or downgrade my account to where I don't have these limits, but right now I can't afford anything more than free.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!",2
"Company Buyout
Hello, I'm fairly new to trading and I have a question regarding a company that I hold shares in. A while ago I bought a few shares of Trina Solar, one of the worlds largest solar panel manufacturers. Recently a deal was made in which the company is being bought out and going private. If this happens, the american depository shares are being bought for 11.60 a share. How would one know if they own an ADS? Is it just the fact that it is a foreign company on the New York Stock Exchange? Trying to decide whether I will be paid this amount back or if I should sell my shares now. Thanks.",1

"Tomorrow Morning Is A Big Day For Retail
Tomorrow morning is a big day for retail. Companies such as Coach Inc(NYSE: COH), TJX Companies Inc(NYSE: TJX), Home Depot Inc(NYSE: HD) and Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE: DKS) are all scheduled to report earnings ahead of the opening bell tomorrow. What do all of these companies have in common? They have all been hurt by the Amazon effect. Even Home Depot Inc(NYSE: HD) saw its stock drop after Amazon announces that it will sell appliances from Kenmore which is owned by Sears Holdings Corp(NASDAQ: SHLD).

Traders and investors will want to watch the SPDR S&P Retail (ETF)(NYSEARCA: XRT) very closely as this will be driven by these leading retail stocks. Since June, the XRT has been in a trading range between the $41.75 and $38.75 levels. Now we will see if these retail giants will move the needle in the XRT tomorrow.

"Help Me Analyze my Mistakes
Hello Redditors, Making this thread to see if you guys can help me analyze my mistakes. Cant get better if you dont know what you are dong wrong. 

ODP \(Office Depot\) \- Wednesday May 9th I bought in at 9:39 at 2.67. Wanted in 2.64 but was slow to purchase. It seemed like there was a small pullback \(need the minute chart to see\) and was gonna shoot up again, but it just dropped instantly. Didnt seem like it was gonna go back up, so I just my losses at $2.46. Looking back the overnight high was 2.68 so never buy at close to that level.

RXII \- Today Friday May 11th I bought in at 9:35 at  $2.47 \(Put in the order at $2.48\). Again seemed like a pullback and considering the overnight high of $2.63, I thought it had room to go up. It went up to  $2.50 before dropping to what seems like support at $2.40. I haven't sold because I feel like this stock is cyclical it has a few green days ahead. Looking back, the overnight low was $2.40, but not sure how I would have came to the conclusion that would have been support.

"Let's talk strategy ...
So, I've recently completely and totally changed my outlook on trading and developed a new strategy. This has taken my day trading to a completely new level, and my gains have drastically increased. 

A very basic overview of my previous strategy was momentum small caps. I had a high win percentage (approx 70%) and generally, my winners were almost always 3:1 profit ratio... you might be thinking that's pretty good, and it is- the issue was that once or twice per month , Is suffer a major, seemingly unavoidable loss... 

Those who trade small caps will know the pain of an order being skipped, especially as the stock falls at a fast rate. Even though I'd sometimes make 5-10k per month on average- I'd sometimes give 50% of that back in 1 single trade . For example, my last big loss was on LEDS about a month ago, I was in 2000 shares after a halt, and pressed my ""bail out 20c offset below the bid"" hotkey as soon as it came down to my entry point - as sometimes happens, it moved so fast it skipped my order and I got stuck in the halt on the way down , it was almost 2.5 points down when I managed to get out after the halt. Half a months gains, wiped out in 30 seconds - and technically, I didn't make an error, just part of trading. 

Just to recap, my old strategy consisted of a combination of gap & go low floats, 1 min & 5 min bullflags, reversals (usually bottom reversals only). 

My new strategy is now very strict with stock price and extremely simplified as to the patterns I play. I only ever trade stocks over $10 and under $100 now. I only ever trade 1 pattern - gap down & fade. (It may be a quick scalp under low of pre-market, or a hold for a continued move to the downside. ) I also never enter a trade past 10:30am, but I will continue to hold if it's in my favor. My last strict rule is that I can only take 4 trades per day. (I allow myself a 5th if all 4 were green). This has helped me to not only stop over trading, but also to cut my losses on a red day- in the past, like many of us, I have been guilty of turning a -$500 losing day to -$1000 or more just by being desperate and trying and get back to break even. 

One final thing about my new strategy is that I changed from my old broker to a European CFD. If you don't know what that is, look into it , but very basically the reasoning behind is is because with CFD's you can short ANY stock (doesn't need to be ""available"" and you also get filled ANY amount of shares (Even if there is only 100 shares on the bid at say 19.70, you can get filled 500 shares at that exact price, instantly). The ""downside"" is that you can only get filled on the bid when shorting, or on the ask when going long- but you simply need to reduce the slippage by trading only stocks with high liquidity, hence low spreads of no more than 1-2 cents. CFD's are definitely NOT for everybody, but they are a huge advantage for my particular strategy. 

What has this resulted in? Almost exactly the same general stats, my win rate is currently about 65% and profit loss ration approx 1:3 , very similar than before, but I end up with about 8-10k in my pocket at the end of each month. Instead of blowing 4-5k on a single trade, and previously cutting my profits  to 5k, I now keep most of my profits. 

Anyway, I'd like to hear a brief summary (doesn't have to be detailed as much as mine) of some of your successful / unsuccessful strategies, what works / doesn't work and why- I think it would be very helpful for both new and experienced traders to share here. ",0
"Trade review on MU
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/I9fLbSIV/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/I9fLbSIV/)

I thought I share a review of my strategy today on MU.  I go through my morning ritual of looking at news on Benzinga and pre\-market movers on Barchart.  MU is almost always on high volume list, because it's a favorite for traders to trade.  In the picture above, I mark down all the premarket highs and lows, and they act as my support/resistance levels.  As the morning bell open, MU just tanks in the first 2 mins and breaks through VWAP.  I'm looking to see if the stock will print a 2 minute pullback green candle and hold under VWAP but it just blows right through it towards premarket low.  I'm still waiting for a pullback to see if anything happens. 

At 6:43am, it starts pulling back, so it peaks my interest.  Several things can happen at this point: 1) Price reverses, crosses VWAP and heads towards premarket high, 2) Price hits VWAP, reverses and goes back towards premarket low or 3) Price chops and continues lower.  As price hits VWAP, I see that the 9ema is about to cross the VWAP, so I set my short order at $61 with a stop loss at $61.20 and profit target of $60.50, low of the day.  My risk is 20cents to make 50cents.

Anyways, the point of this post is again, just to share my strategy, thought process and anticipating the trade.  Not all trades work out like this but this was particularly a good one.  A lot of people just say ""hey just use these indicators or look at price action"" but how do you use it?  I'm hoping this example helps struggling traders.

I was pretty pleased with the $50 I made on the trade until I literally watched it go up to $7.45 maybe 10 seconds later. After I watched it peak and valley a little, I bought back in around $7.79 thinking it would keep pushing. I watched it fall and chickened out at $7.35 or so and called it a day, fairly pleased to close out my first ever experience in the, albeit modest, green. Now, I’m not saying I’m crushed or anything... but that price closed at $17. 

Overall experience: 10/10 would do again. Would you experienced guys think about buying in at $17 still, or is that jump too extreme, and could it start dipping back?

Dividend.com tells me that it pays out 0.0983$ per share monthly, with a current share price of 15.11$ quick maths shows that I would only need about 155 shares to gain 1 share monthly, which costs about 2350$USD. So where am I going wrong or am I at all? Because that seems too good to be true and when it feels that way it usually is. Am I actually taxed for these dividends?

"Questions From A Beginner
Hey guys, I've been investing in real estate for a while, have my Roth and Employer 401K  as well, but after speaking with a friend I'm setting my sights on dividends. I purchased some books that I'll start reading this weekend, but I figured I'd fire off some rookie questions here that h ave been bothering me. 

I see some websites that show ""must invest stocks""  like Johnson and Johnson but the yield is 2.69% Then I go to a page like this:  [https://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/high-dividend-yield-stocks/#stocks&sort\_name=dividend\_yield&sort\_order=desc&page=1](https://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/high-dividend-yield-stocks/#stocks&sort_name=dividend_yield&sort_order=desc&page=1)  which shows stocks like FELP that has a 34.29% yield. My question is, why wouldn't someone just pick any of the stocks on this page which seem to show much higher returns? What am I missing here?",1

This year Premier Bank has started doing dividends. I believe that this company will continue to grow and be able to sustain their dividend and probably increase it each year.

AGNC, MAIN, and SPHD.

And am thinking of also getting into Quarterly stocks like

"What are your thoughts on mREITs?
So I've been looking at NLY.  mREITs inherently high dividend yeild (12% for NLY) and low P/E ratio (~3) makes them an attractive investment.  This past year was a tough one for NLY, reducing its price by nearly 50%, but I'm thinking this may be a good opportunity to jump in.  With the FEDs promise to keep short term interest rates near zero and the increase in the long term interest rate the margin between the two will benefit mREITs mortgage backed security (MBS) purchases.

Also, many of the reported losses for NLY this past fiscal year was a factor of repositioning, from selling MBS that were squeezed from poor yield spread. This should improve for the reasons stated above.

Finally, NLYs fiscal year revenues and EPS has risen annually over the past 3 years.

"Solar stocks seem to be doing great
*Note: I heavily invested in SPWR 6 months ago.*

It looks like the solar industry has been having a good day today (+7->14%), even though the rest of the markets are down. I'm not sure what exactly is causing this (epic news? excitement? random noise? investing for the future?). I've been casually following the solar industry for the last few months and I thought it'd be good to start a conversation about it.

For starters, I suspect that solar is most dominate in sunny parts of the US, especially where there are lots of people and money, which leaves mostly California (with AZ and NV as follow ups) as the primary market. What happens in CA has a big effect on the industry (?). This [article](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/01/02/3110731/california-rooftop-solar-2013/) confirms my belief and claims that more solar was installed last year than the last 30 years combined. It fails to state which solar companies specifically are most responsible for this trend. My suspicion is that SolarCity ([SCTY](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ASCTY)) probably has most of the CA residential market share, with SunPower Corp ([SPWR](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ASPWR)) coming in 2nd place. What I don't know is the level of investment in solar infrastructure by foreign countries (japan, china, EU, etc) and the impact that would have on the industry as a whole (what countries are spending the most, and what are the company market shares?)

I just found Canadian Solar Inc ([CSIQ](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ACSIQ)) which has had +83% growth in the last three months. This really baffles me. I didn't think there would be much of a market for solar energy in Canada, but after a bit of research, I find that they're a multinational corporation with global operations in rich, populated countries. Their growth makes a bit of sense.

What's been kind of strange about the solar industry is that every solar company's stock performance has been pretty much synchronized and somewhat independent of the rest of the markets. I'm not sure why. I know that a lot of the past downward pressure was due to an oversaturation of cheap solar panels flooding the markets, coming from china, but after some tarrifs were put in place in the EU (& US?), that effect seems to have subsided a bit (?). Regardless, the conclusion seems to be that *something* is causing all of the solar stocks to move with roughly the same trend lines, and perhaps, investing in any of them is much like investing in all of them. I have no idea why or how interconnected they all are with each other. Maybe there's just a lot more demand than supply?

Looking ahead: If solar companies have the same or greater volume of installation for 2014 as they did for 2013, investing in a solar company would be a pretty good safe bet. With the political impetus going towards green, renewable energy, and the spate of nuclear disasters (fukushima), solar and wind seem to be an industry which will be growing for the next decade.

"Dumb money talks. Smart money listens.
There's a lot of talk about smart money and dumb money, and which is why. Here's the clear delineator: dumb money talks, smart money listens.

I chatted with a friend of mine on FB last night, just general catching up and whatnot. He knows I work on WS, so when the topic of investing came up, you'd think he'd ask me for any tips, right? Nope--instead he bragged about his past performance and how the looming Malthusian crisis was going to make gold and oil explode in value, hence his big bets on both (not that those worked too well for him in 2013, of course).

Now when I talk to professional money managers, the conversation is the exact opposite. They don't brag about past performance or tell me their investment hypotheses. They want to know what I know. They listen very closely, and ask probing questions. They don't care if they look stupid or smart or good or bad. All that they care about is learning something.

This trend is so common that I've made it an axiom of finance and it determines my own strategies in life: dumb money talks. Smart money listens.

So next time you feel the urge to post about your killer trade or how you scaled 10 cents off of a rally in TSLA, or next time you want to reply to a post telling OP what an idiot he is for thinking X, Y, or Z, just remember:

"CPSS- Great value or great risk
Below is an excerpt from this article http://seekingalpha.com/article/1930651-4-Stocks-That-Could-See-Significant-Gains-In-2014?source=google_news

*Consumer Portfolio Services (CPSS)

The next selection is one that doesn't really have a comparable valuation peer, but is growing fast nonetheless, and priced significantly cheaper than companies with a similar growth rate.

The company is called Consumer Portfolio Services and it is a sub-$200 million company with average volume of roughly 100,000 shares traded. Hence, it is unknown, or very under-the-radar.

Consumer Portfolio Services, or CPSS, operates an automobile finance lending business. The company provides indirect financing to customers with limited credit histories, low income, or who have past credit problems. Thus, with auto sales on the rise, a low rate environment, and an increase in sub-prime borrowers, CPSS looks poised to rally and grow considerably.

Since 2011's boom in auto sales, CPSS has grown full-year sales from $132 million to $172 million expected for the full-year of 2013. In addition, operating margins have soared from negative 10% to positive 28.5% in the same period. Moreover, in 2014, analysts expect that sales will surge to $238.5 million, or growth of 38.8%.

The bottom line is that when the auto market is strong, and CPSS is firing on all cylinders, the company achieves strong growth and earns large profits. But to the contrary, when the market's bad, or if a sudden change occurs, CPSS is also drastically affected due to being highly exposed to high-risk clients and large sums of debt.*

With that said, the auto market is expected to remain strong next year, and CPSS is trying diligently to boost the size of its total managed loan portfolio, which it's doing successfully. For these reasons investors should be optimistic about next year. And what makes this entire situation even better is that CPSS is trading at just 0.79 times next year's sales!

In comparison, the S&P 500 trades at 1.65 times sales, and the financial services industry trades at 2.2 times sales. Not to mention, CPSS trades at just 8 times next year's earnings, making this unknown stock a clear value investment. Much like all of the companies covered, CPSS could easily double and it would still be cheap relative to its peers and industry.


NOT GOOD AT FORMATTING- ABOVE FROM ARTICLE, Below is my input.  

Anyways, I have been following this stock for a few months. They seem to be a solid growth story with a good management teams. However, a rising rate environment could have serious impact on their margins. Ignore the trailing PE, it is artificially low due to a 1 time tax credit in 2012. but if you look at forward earnings, they seem to be exponentially cheaper than their competitors. also, their competitior Nicholas Financial (NICK) just got bought out for $329 million, with half the revenues of CPSS. CPSS current market cap is $200m. Sub prime auto finance seems to be a market the big banks are trying to penetrate, and while this could be a competition risk, i think it makes cpss an attractive acquisition for a firm looking to enter the sub prime markets with an existing and successful structure in place. what are your guys thoughts? This company was under $1 a share in jan of 2012. ",2

"Noob analysis on AMD and Nvidia
Hey guys, so this will be my first time investing and I've been reading a book on stocks.  So I thought I'd run my very noob analysis across you guys and you can make fun of me!

So basically I looked at the last quarterly earnings of AMD and Nvidia and tried to gauge the health of their financials.

**AMD (everything is in millions, shares used is 757)**

Current Assets:       $2,939

Current Liabilities:   $1,762

Current Ratio (Can they pay their immediate debts?):  1.66799:1
  

Total Assets:          $4,317

Total Liabilities:      $3,883

Total Ratio:             1.11769:1

Equity to Shareholders:  $434....therefore $0.5733 cents per share

EPS:  $0.06 (Q3 of 2013)

Gross Profit Margin:  36% (fell 4% compared to last quarter)

Operating Profit Maring:  6.5%

Net Profit Margin:           3.28%


Book Value Per Share:  0.5733157:1, or $0.5733 cents per share

Price-Book Ratio:  $4.02 / 0.5733 = 7.012

Price/Earnings Ratio = 67

Quick Ratio:  1,933 (Immediate cash on hand) / 1,762 = 1:1.0970

ROE (Return on Investment) = 48 / 434 = 11.06%

Price/Sales Ratio = Market Cap at time of Q3 report / Sales = 3,043.14 / 1,461 = $2.0829 per dollar of AMD sale

.

.

.


**NVIDIA (everything is in thousand, shares used is 580,870 for calculations)**

Current Assets:       $4,049,841

Current Liabilities:   $985,927

Current Ratio (Can they pay their immediate debts?):  4.107:1
  

Total Assets:          $5,711,373

Total Liabilities:      $1,390,726

Total Ratio:             4.10675:1

Equity to Shareholders:  $4,320,647.....therefore $7.438 per share if liquidated

EPS:  $0.204 (Most recent quarter)

Gross Profit Margin:  55.44%

Operating Profit Margin:  13.37%

Net Profit Margin:           11.26%


Book Value Per Share:  $7.438:1

Price-Book Ratio:  $16.28 / 7.4382 = 2.1887

Price/Earnings Ratio = 79.80

Quick Ratio:  3,032,954 (Immediate cash on hand) / 985,927  = 3.0762:1

ROE (Return on Investment) = 118,734 / 4,320,647 = 2.7480%

Price/Sales Ratio = Market Cap at time of report / Sales = 9.3 BILLION / 1.053967 BILLION = $8.823 per dollar of Nvidia Sale
.

.

.

.


So, based off these numbers, it seems like Nvidia is in better financial shape overall.  They can pay off their debts a lot easier, their EPS is higher, and their profit margins are better for this quarter.  Also, I read news that they are buying back a lot of their shares over the next year, up to $750,000,000 worth with an option of $1 billion more (this is a good thing right?).

Nvidia's Price/Earning Ratio is is higher though and their ROE is pretty lower, so that is not as cool.  Their Price/Sales ratio tells us they we pay more per dollar of sales then we do for AMD, so that isn't good either.

AMD released their new APU Kaveri which is supposedly very important though it is tough to say how good it will do.  They have the Mac Pro contract so all Mac Pro's will run AMD video cards, as well as the Xbox One and PS4 contracts, so as sales of those continue throughout 2014 they will be making a profit on those.  There is also the X factor or mining lite coins.  A lot of Radeon cards are sold out and are becoming scarce due to people buying them all up to mine litecoins, so that may show an unexpected bump in their sales perhaps?

Anyway, I was thinking of buying some AMD stock, but from their history it seems to go down everytime they report their earnings.  

Is AMD worth holding long?  Nvidia seems like the safer bet as they are stronger financially, but AMD seems to have more room to grow, but their liabilities worry.

And why do each of these companies have such a high price/earning ratio???

Anyway, I'm a newb and I'm sorry but I haven't researched much into Nvidia yet so I can't comment on their technicals.  Can we get a discussion going?

"How Would You Explain the Much Talked About Fed Tapering to a New Investor? What Is It? What Are the Implications?
I'm new to investing and am currently going through the process of self educating myself on finances, cash flow, stocks, index funds, etc.

I intend to purchase approximately 100 STY (S&P 500) ETF shares in the near future. I'm however rather uneasy about the much talked about Fed tapering, mostly because I can't seem to find any place that would explain to me in layman terms what exactly it's all about, what effect it is likely to have on the stock market - index funds in particular, what the implications are, etc.

This lack of information tends to create a rather irrational fear of unknown in my mind, putting me in a position whereby I don't know what to do next?

Could someone who understands tapering explain to me what exactly it's all about, what it means and what it is likely to do to index funds.

Would I be wiser to put off buying SPY shares until later in the year, after the supposed tapering, or will it make no difference? Would I just miss out on a few months of being in the market and collecting dividends if I needlessly put the purchase off?

"Maybe worth adding POT to your portfolio?
I've recently been looking into Potash Corp and the results of my assessment lead me to believe it's a reasonably priced long-term holding that could pay off pretty well.

You didn't think this was another marijuana penny stock post, did you? :)

Potash is a key ingredient in fertilizer and unless I am mistaken, Potash Corp is still the largest producer in the world with around 20% market share. It is incidentally also #3 in the world for producing nitrogen and phosphates, less profitable but also key constituents of fertilizers, though potash is the majority of its revenue and profit. While the production of nitrogen and phosphates is highly fractured and Potash's #3 ranking is therefore actually only a very small percentage of global production, that's not the case with potash.

Distribution of potash reserves across the globe is pretty uneven. 2 cartels comprised of 5 companies (Potash, Agrium, Mosaic, Belaruskali and Uralkali) substantially control the market and as a result profits have been consistently high for the incumbent players because they have been able to control production very tightly.

The seeming opportunity in Potash as come about as a result of one of those players, Uralkali, electing to exit this cartel mechanism and increase production quantities to gain market share. This has resulted in a pretty significant decline in potash prices that, naturally, hurts Potash Corp. Shares fell hard in July 2013 on this news and since then a cloud of doom and gloom has hung over the industry, with wide consensus in the market being that it's a race to the bottom now and that everyone will lose. I expect you'd find a very negative overall analyst sentiment towards Potash Corp.

The choice for the world's other major players at this point is to answer with their own increases in production or not. The answer thus far has been not. In fact, Potash has cut costs by stopping production at higher cost mines and laying off people. It's not the lowest cost producer in this industry (Cartel-breaker Uralkali is), but it's next to it. Potash can afford to hang in there while the industry tests Uralkali's mettle. Potash is a well capitalized company with a solid balance sheet.

In the meantime, this cartel-breaking activity on Uralkali's part has had some interesting side effects.

First and foremost, it has brewed a political firestorm in Russia and Belarus. Political pressure could potentially unwind Uralkali's actions.

More interestingly, perhaps, is that this action raises the barriers to entry in the potash industry, which are already very high. Building a mine from scratch would be a multi-billion dollar endeavor, assuming you had a resource worth mining. Now, with asset prices looking decidedly less attractive, the payout from such a significant investment is all the lower. The reason this is so interesting is that the world's largest mining company, BHP Billiton, has long been interested in potash. In fact, they tried to buy Potash Corp for $40B in 2010.

They do own a mine in Saskatchewan, though, and they do plan to spend 2-3B to build it out... But as of August they have slowed their intentions due to the impact of Uralkali's actions on the market.

The cartel-breaking actions of Uralkali have at least somewhat stymied the cartel-breaking competitive entry of BHP Billiton to the industry.

In the meantime, people have to eat and that's something that won't change. I expect demand for Potash to move in only one direction and Potash Corp's estimated 60-80 years of reserves make it a likely last man standing.

What we're looking at here is a company that controls the world's largest reserves of an asset that is critical to industrial food production suffering significantly reduced expectations as a result of what I think is likely to be a non-permanent change in its competitive landscape.

In other words, the makings of a decent long-term entry point?

In the meantime, you get paid pretty well to wait. The yield on Potash is in excess of 4% and well-covered by cash flow. Lower potash prices will cut into cash flow, naturally, but I think the dividend is still covered. And in case you're concerned about it, CEO Bill Doyle has repeatedly stated his commitment to the dividend. He did have to back off of calling it ""sacrosanct"" to alleviate political pressure from Saskatchewan's premier, though.

Incidentally, the falling Canadian dollar may offer something of a tailwind for Potash Corp so you have a currency-related leg up. Production costs will fall relative to the price of the asset.

I decided to try performing a discounted cash flow analysis to see what the market is thinking here and I came up with the following:

Slash TTM cash flow by 25%, then assume 1% inflationary growth and 2.5% growth due to what I assume would be consistent global growth in demand for 25 years. Discount at 11%. The result delivers Potash's current approximate valuation.

Are those fair assumptions to make or are they perhaps on the gloomy side? Time will tell, but I opened a very small starter position for myself and I'll keep looking. I think this is a pretty decent looking position at current prices and I don't mind putting 4%/year in my pocket.

Any thoughts?

Hi All,

I know the general recommendation around here is invest in low cost index ETFs or funds, which I already do for the majority of my portfolio.

However, once you become an accredited investor (for which the definition is different depending on where you live), a world of new options open up to you. One such option is a Canadian Limited Partnership named King and Victoria. The full blown LP has a $500,000 minimum investment, but they have a fund version that has a $1000 minimum investment.

"GameStop (GME) down almost 20% on softened sales outlook
By  Ben Fox Rubin 
 NEW YORK  (MarketWatch) --  GameStop Corp. (GME) lowered its already soft earnings estimate for the critical holiday quarter, as the videogame retailer continues to struggle with weaker sales and consumer interest in cheaper mobile games.


Shares fell following the news. As of Monday's close, the stock was down 12% in the past three months.
The company now expects to post quarterly income of  $1.85 to $1.95  a share, down from its downbeat November forecast of  $1.97 to $2.14  a share. However, same-store sales are expected to reach the high end of its guidance. The retailer had predicted a 2% to 9% rise.


 GameStop  also trimmed its full-year earnings estimate, now seeing  $2.96 to $3.06  a share, down from its November view of  $3.08 to $3.25  a share.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




Personally I believe there's more to this story than just one failed quarter of execution. People have been wanting to get short on ""The next Blockbuster"" for some time. Looks like today was the breaking point. I honestly can't remember the last time I bought a physical copy of a video game. Even Nintendo, who classically has been behind the curve on anything internet related, is releasing some of their most popular titles for direct download. I just don't see the used game model surviving another generation.",0

"A thought after a quick glance at Amazon and Wal-mart.
I decided to look at the past year's quarterly earnings statements of Amazon and Wal-mart, since their businesses are very similar aside from the fact that Amazon is an online retailer.  Just keep in mind that only ~60% of Amazon's revenue comes from retail.  

Amazon currently makes very little net profit because all of that would-be net profit is reinvested back into the business.  I and many others have known this for a while.  

What really surprised me was how little revenue Amazon brings in every quarter compared to Wal-mart.  Wal-mart has a total of $474.74 billion in revenue for the past 12 months, with an average annual revenue growth rate of ~4.75% since 2010.  On the other hand, Amazon has a total of $70.13 billion in revenue for the past 12 months, with an average annual revenue growth rate of ~35.73% since 2010.  Its revenue grew 39.56% in 2010 and 40.56% in 2011, but fell to 27.07% in 2012.  

So Wal-mart's revenue (ttm) is 6.77 times greater than Amazon, but Amazon's revenue growth rate is 7.5 times greater than Wal-mart.  Even assuming Amazon maintains that average revenue growth since 2010, it will still take Amazon a little over 6 years to reach Wal-mart's current revenue.  And as a side note, Wal-mart currently has around $73 billion in book equity compared to Amazon's $9 billion.  

Having said all of that, does it seem a little odd that Amazon already commands a $181 billion market cap compared to Wal-mart's $250 billion?  I don't think it's impossible for Amazon's performance over the next 10 years to justify its current premium, but doesn't it seem somewhat unlikely?  I just feel like so many future expectations are baked into its current share price.  The company will undoubtedly grow into its current share price eventually, and then some, but will it happen fast enough to satisfy current expectations?",1
"Which companies do you consider most innovative?
I'm not talking about long-shot penny stock that might have the cure for cancer. 

I mean companies with an overall ""innovative"" vision. 

For example, GOOG is obviously extremely innovative; driver-less cars, home integration, web, etc. 

AMZN is very innovative; online shopping, the drone concept, their server farms, cloud, prime video, etc.

TSLA is innovative in their one product, but I don't know if I'd call the company altogether ""innovative"" as they're really just pursuing one singular (granted large) innovation. 

I realize this is /r/investing and that a lot of these products (Amazon drones, driver-less cars, etc) may not be profitable or relevant to corporate p/l any time soon, but I personally like innovative companies. Companies that push the envelope and don't put themselves in a ""box"". Google doesn't say ""We're a search engine"", Amazon doesn't say ""We sell books online"", etc. They're companies that are constantly looking to push boundaries and societal norms, they question the status quo, etc. 

Anyway, curious what innovative companies may be out there that aren't as obvious as the cop-outs I listed.

Hello!

So right now I'm currently trading options. I'm fairly new to this. But one of many questions that I have is... When do I take my profits? So far I bought a contract for 2.03 and right now it's at 2.88. I spent around 220 dollars in total, and I have a profit about 90 dollars.
I sometimes feel that I ""gamble"" during profit taking times. Maybe it's lack of knowledge that leads me to continue to ""believe"" that I'll be making more profit, but in reality it's a straight up guess to be honest. I know I should educate myself more, but I just wanted to know, when do you take profits? Whether it be stocks or options? Also, is there a topic in trading called ""Profit Taking""? If there is I would like to really look into that topic.

Thanks always!

This is what I've posted in /r/investing. I noticed after someone posted that I haven't even stated whether it was a put or a call.

I sold the Jan16 1.00 Put and bought the Jan16 1.50 Call for .07 credit.

(EDIT: To clarify, I did both trades together as a ""combo"" for a credit of .07)

Max loss : Stock below .93/share or 93.00/per contract ++

Break Even : stock at .93 in Jan 2016

Max Gain : theoretically, unlimited.  Realistically, a buyout wouldn't bring more than 5.00 or so (pulled from azz).  But if it did get to 5.00, that's a profit of > 400.00 / contract.

++ If the price is below 1.00 on Jan 16, and they haven't gone bankrupt, *which is a real possibility*, the trade isn't over.  You would be long the shares of stock with a .93/share cost basis.

"DIVIDEND PLAYS (round 2 - the circlejerk continues) [swearing in this post]
Alright as some of you may have seen last week I posted some stuff about dividend plays in some thread relating to dividend plays which are advanced strategies used by market makers and large props to capture near risk free money (you know what, fuck it no lawyers here to handjibber around - it is risk free money 99.99999999999999% of the time). If you didn't see it you may want to take a look before you start reading this. 

Before we go on **no you can't fucking do this strategy!!!** (which is too bad and the SEC should stop this BS but they won't because they really don't know that it is happening)

So here is my issue - I am short the GME 41/42 call spread expiring regular way in SEP. For shits and gigs we are using this even though it isn't a great example.

Here is how this is all set up - 

GME is trading 42.90
DIV of 33 cents going ex on 8/29 which means I am in danger of being assigned on 8/28 and then will be liable for the dividend (fuck that)

41 calls on a 76^ and still have 23 days left to rot

- if these calls had less then a week I would trade out of this before the div - basically if theta is less then the div price I would for sure be screwed. 

I would then look at OI to see what is going on there. If OI is high relative to volume then these fuckers are crossing on the PHLX (seriously, if you see a lot of volume on PHLX then get the fuck out). Take a look at time and sales and see where the (generally) 85-100 delta options are being traded for size.

basically, pay attention to positions and if you are short deep ITM calls on a dividend paying stock that has large OI and low time to rot then I would get out.

"GoPro puts too expensive / arbitrage opportunity
I was looking to buy a put position in GoPro and noticed that an at the money put was **significantly** more expensive than an at the money call.  I'm used to those being very close in cost, and there's a principle called [Put/Call Parity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put%E2%80%93call_parity) that suggests they should be very close.
For example, with AAPL at $100, the October 100 puts and calls are both about $2.

To constract this with GoPro: It's trading at about $82 and the October 82 put ($9) sold for over double what the call last sold for($4.30).  After a bit of research I came across [Conversion Arbitrage information](http://www.investopedia.com/university/conversion-arbitrage/conversion-arbitrage4.asp), that suggests the following ""no risk"" strategy:

* buy 82 call @ ask   $4.4
* sell 82 put @ bid    $8.6
* short stock @ bid   $81.62

For one contract this comes out to a profit of $420 (minus commission) on $8162 invested or about 5% profit in 21 days.

However, when I attempt to put the trade in, I get an error ""shares not currently available to short"".

Anyone know of any way around this or have thoughts on this situation?  It seems my broker doesn't have shares to short.  Is this common when the stock is rallying so much?

"Skew - differences in IV for puts and calls
What is skew and why does it matter? Skew is the difference in implied volatility between puts and calls. For example on SPY (S&P 500 index etf), lets look at the November 2014 strike, 10 points out of the money. 

With SPY at 197.9

SPY Nov 208 calls are bid .26

SPY Nov 188 puts are bid 1.55

That's a big skew in favor of puts. Why does this happen? Options get priced by supply and demand. Many SPY owners are willing to write covered calls and take about a 5% gain by November if called. A lot of SPY owners also want insurance against an October smash, so there is a lot of demand for out of the money puts.

For years on SPY, the skew has been towards puts. Some observers are saying that the skew is as wide or wider than it has ever been. I don't track this, but that back of the envelope example shows a big skew towards puts. Some use this as a market sentiment indicator.

A brief definition of skew is at:

"GPRO options strategy
due to hard to borrow status, the 2016 GPRO ATM puts are much more expensive than ATM calls (but it's like this at all expiration times). This is because you have to pay a huge interest to short it.

what would happen if shares suddenly became available to borrow...would the put equalize with the call, causing a massive decline in the extrinsic value? 

Would a good strategy be to go short long dated puts ? Or buy a weekly ATM call, short a weekly ATM put and then buy a single deep in the money put to try to arbitrage?

It seems like everyone is expecting this to crash..just such a weird situation , maybe some professionals can explain in more detail what is going on.

"GPRO leaving more of a mess than Katy Perry riding a sybian
So for those of you that were short deep ITM GoPro calls you may have been assigned at some point this week. I was, for example, assigned last night on the 70 call line for oct (yes oct) regular way expiration. Normally, I would be OK with this - short the stock I am covered because I am long the 72.5 p and have been rolling up puts and buying them back intraday while this POS has been on its circle jerk however because of reg sho rules I can't remain short the stock for more than a day (the clearing house will buy in after a day)

So here is the reason why your beloved midgetginger was assigned on these calls still with a boatload of time value:

REG SHO.

For those of you that were assigned I called GSEC and asked if a corporate action (special div etc) had occurred and they said no which means that people were exercising to get long the stock so they could:

1. cover their shorts and then sell a deep ITM put (this probably is illegal) to get short the stock. It is pretty unlikely that the will be able to locate stock to sell short right now according to people that I spoke with.

2. Cover their own assignments from the day before

3. Didn't realize that theta still existed in the option

4. really wanted to get long the stock for some reason.

The calc is saying the Oct 31st expiration option will only net me a 65% return vs. a 131% return for the Nov 7th expiration if sold on the 31st at a strike of 220.

"'candle size' indicator alludes to substantial upside in SPY and QQQ
This is more of a market analysis than an option trade. Things like moving averages, technical analysis like head and shoulders, put/call volume, vix, advancing declining, breadth, distribution days (worthless IBD indicators) imho all these don't work reliably, especially not for indexes. 

The only indicator that seems to be reliable is  the candle size of the monthly chart of the ES/SPY/QQQ relative to earlier candles. A choppy pattern with large candles like in 2000 and in 2007 is pretty bearish.

"put/call ratio. how to interpret?
I'm looking at options with high open interest and saw a wide range of put/call ratios. 

http://www.optionistics.com/screener/open-interest-highest-stock

So for instance, SPY and SPX have put/call ratios of 1.90 and 1.94. If there is more put activity than call activity, then either people are using options as a hedge, or are bearish, or puts have a higher premium so there is more trading activity.

For BAC and APPL, the put/call ratio is closer to 1, so investor sentiment for these stocks seems to be neutral.

"Deep deep value stocks
Deep value stocks are companies with a ton of assets and usually some very good reason for trading far below NAV. A good example is Barnwell Industries (BRN), a small Hawaii real estate developer and Canadian nat gas company that has traded in the low single digits for decades. Not until the old owners die will the stock begin to approach full value, which is conceivably as high as $20. Usually these companies suffer from a combination of entrenched management and poor capital allocation or other disqualifying factors, such as a large lawsuit or other hard to quantify liabilities. Crucially deep value stocks have no value catalyst in the foreseeable future, which accounts for the deep undervaluation.

"Thoughts on Declining Revenues? (Pfizer)
Hello everyone,


What is your thoughts on a company that has declining revenues? Typically I have a rule of thumb that if a company has two years in a row of declining revenues that I sell. This may seem ignorant but I would rather have my money in growing companies.


I have owned shares of Pfizer for a little while now and it came up on my portfolio annual review as one to sell as they have had now 3 years of declining revenues. However it appears the answer isn't so simple.


PFE's stock has gone up in almost a straight line over the past five years. However it isn't necessarily the business outperforming but a mixture of cutting R&D and share buybacks to boost EPS.


Last year they spun off Zoetis which has around $5billion in annual revenues. If shareholders would have received ZTS from the spinoff I wouldn't be having this discussion and be more than happy to hold.  However they did an IPO and shareholders did not get any shares. As Pfizer continues to spinoff businesses like this what should I do with my position?


They do have steady cash flow from their consumer brands (Advil, Centrum, ChapStick, Robitussin, Preperation H, Thermacare) and still have strong sales from a couple blockbuster prescription drugs (Lipitor, Viagra, Chantix). So there is very little risk in the business, they are setup for success. Not to mention a 3.30% yield.
Because of their declining sales though they have a PEG ratio of an outstanding 4.56!! How can I ignore that? That is the highest PEG in my entire portfolio. This a strong indication I should sell.


Reddit, what should I do? Hold Pfizer and allow them to scale down via spinoffs and continue to buyback shares even though R&D has been cut which impacts future growth? Or Sell Pfizer due to declining revenues?",0
"My Research into InvenSense (INVN). The Future of Tech? (xpost /r/investing)
I have been doing some research into InvenSense (INVN) lately and am considering buying and holding for a long time.  Honestly I first heard of the stock because The Motley Fool was pushing it.  Normally I don't listen to other's opinions but the idea seemed legit and I started to dig.  The more I started to read, the more intrigued I became.  There are some short term risk factors with the company and stock but I believe long term that they can overcome those obstacles.

Before learning about this company it is first needed to understand what the future of tech is going to look like.  I have posted about this before on how ""The Internet of Things"" is going to take over this economy.  Every ""thing"" is going to be connected to the internet and will be able to communicate with each other.  One of the most important ways this can happen is with sensors.  Below are some links to get you started to explain how the ""Internet of Things"" will transform the way we live:

* [Quartz 3 Part Series](http://qz.com/156075/internet-of-things-will-replace-the-web/)
* [GE White Paper](http://www.ge.com/docs/chapters/Industrial_Internet.pdf)
* [Cisco White Paper](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoT_IBSG_0411FINAL.pdf)
* [Mckinsey Report on Disruptive Tech](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/disruptive_technologies)

InvenSense makes and produces motion sensor technology, mainly gyroscopes and accelerometers.  This is essentially behind all of ""The Internet of Things"" due to be able to pinpoint and track your actions of what you are doing at all times.  All smartphones/tablets/smart TVs have these in them now.  They are moving to a point of wearables for fitness devices and smart watches.  

Last year they just came out with image stabilization sensors to install for cameras of smart phones or other applications.  Go Pro cameras and large media cameras use stabilization sensors in them for example.  As their major customers are smartphones and tablets, this is an excellent complementary product to sell to the same manufacturer. Also they are producing industrial sensors to sell to major companies though not much for actual sales yet.  

There are random other uses for the sensors.  Do you ever see those toy remote helicopters?  InvenSense sensors are in those. I know Reddit itself is hardly a place for research but go check out [/r/ECE](http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/1jduau/gyro_inverting_its_maximum_or_mimumum_output/) and see what they think of InvenSense.  There is also an article of the [Nexus 5 Components](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1pcmda/nexus_5_indepth_components_list/) list with it in there.  Currently they are also using the technology in small toy robotics as well.

Now think bigger, do you know what this means?  These guys are one big industrial contract away from being behind the sensors that enable the tech infrastructure build out.  This is what will power autonomous cars, it is what will take entire train fleets under better management (Check out the [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2014/01/22/americas-second-rail-boom/) I have posted before).  InvenSense in the future will be behind drones, advanced robotics, and a smart infrastructure/power grid.  If things go right, they are the future of tech.        

So what is holding me back?  Well prior to 2007, they had 0 revenues.  Their first big break was with Nintendo.  They are the ones who powered the Wii remote and the Wii Motion Plus.  Sounds awesome right?  Nintendo was 85% of their total revenues in 2011.  Guess what has happened to Nintendo since then?  

Their ""Gaming"" segment (aka Nintendo) has decreased by about 50% over the past year.  As an offset however, their tablets/smartphone division has increased by 47% which is an increase in sales as the device segment is 74% of sales.  Their Optical Stabilization and Other segment has grown 128% YOY.  

* [Segment Reporting](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=8DDDE01AC2383407!2592&authkey=!AOTtz5gP104C07k&v=3&ithint=photo%2c.jpg)

So even though they are doing fine as Nintendo struggles, they are behind all of Samsung and now which result in a small majority of InvenSense's revenues. 

""For the three months ended September 29, 2013, two customers each accounted for 36% (Samsung) and 14% (Nintendo) of total net revenue. For the six months ended September 29, 2013, one customer accounted for 31% (Samsung) of total net revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2012, three customers each accounted for 29% (Nintendo), 19% (Samsung) and 17% (Quanta) of total net revenue. For the six months ended September 30, 2012, three customers each accounted for 22% (Nintendo), 19% (Samsung) and 15% (Quanta) of total net revenue.""

So essentially, if Samsung starts to struggle like Nintendo is, it could be real problems for the company.  However they have a fortress of a balance sheet and their business model allows for flexibility in scaling up or down.  

InvenSense is generating cash hand over fist.  Now they are no Apple but currently they have over $161 million in cash and short term securities on their balance sheet.  Their current ratio is an outstanding 9.3!! That is nearly unheard of.  On top of that, the company has zero debt.  If they grew revenues less than 35% next year, they would be able to pay for all of their Cost of Goods Sold right now if they wanted to.  They are in no risk of going out of business any time soon.    

Next is their business model.  The company does all of their manufacturing over in Taiwan and leases all buildings and equipment.  This is great because there are no hard assets to maintain on the balance sheet and it allows them to scale up or down with minimal cost. 

Because there is very little liquidity risk, the company has nearly doubled it's R&D expenditures, moving from 10% to near 14% of total revenues.  This is a good sign for the future to fuel the innovation going forward.  

As they sit to report in a couple of days, their valuation is set fairly high.  Currently trading at 32x earnings, it is not cheap.  One thing that is of note is that they have been steadily issuing shares, about 7 million more shares over two years, which amounts to about 9% dilution.  I am not sure as to the reason behind this and it needs further research.  Because of the issuance of shares their EPS did not move at all even though there has been explosive growth in revenues.  It doesn't make sense to me that a financially stable company would dilute their shares like that if there was no reason to raise money.  It could be through stock options though as 36% of the company is owned by insiders.

If InvenSense can diversify it's customer base to different device manufacturers (aka Apple) and get into the industrial sector, there can be explosive upside to this stock.  As more and more people obtain smartphones, their sales and cash flow will continuously improve.  

Even though expensive now, I believe that the company will thrive in the future and has the liquidity to survive any bumps along the road.  I am going to be buying 1/2 of my wanted position before earnings, and the other 1/2 after I see what the results are.  These are just my assumptions here, but Samsung will probably come out with a slight increase in device revenues (even though quite amazing) and Nintendo's revenues will continue to fall.   

With a market cap of only $1.7 billion, there is a lot of room to run and the company is just scratching the surface of it's potential.  I intend to hold this stock for a long time and build a sizable position in it.",2

"Spirit Airlines - Forming a Thesis
A while back I listened to a NPR Planet Money Podcast interview with Spirit Airlines CEO Ben Boldanza which really caught my attention. The business model and the company culture really stuck in my head (even though I am not sure I would want to fly Spirit myself). I believe Spirit (SAVE) exhibits some characteristics of other high quality businesses.
I would like to prove out my theory (one way or the other) by doing some analysis and was wondering where are some good places to start as I am not an experienced security analyst. Although I do have access to Capital IQ and Bloomberg through my day job. In addition I wouldn't mind hearing what other people think about the stock.

*Ben Baldanza seems to be a highly capable and passionate CEO. I don’t have any solid data points but he seems to potentially be shareholder friendly in terms of capital allocation.  Unfortunately he does not have a large stake in the firm

*Spirit has a company culture oriented on cutting costs. Examples include their bare bones corporate headquarters.

*As part of Spirit’s strategy of “unbundling” their service for their customers they are focused on gaining market share by giving back to the customers to increase the loyalty effect. (scaled shared economics).  In a recent WSJ article discussing the potential downfall of Southwest there was a chart showing how all of the major airlines prices have increased in 2013 relative to 2008, but Spirits ticket prices actually went down.  This reminds me of Costco. http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303949704579459643375588678

*Spirit exhibits signs of being ahead of the innovation curve. Whether it is in terms of marketing, willingness to advertise within the airplane, or putting sleeper beds in the cargo hold they are clearly not afraid of taking little bets.  http://www.amazon.com/Little-Bets-Breakthrough-Emerge-Discoveries/dp/1439170436

*Spirit largely has a bad reputation, but it doesn’t seem to have stopped them from keeping people coming back and filling up the seats. I think the bad reputation stems from customers going to a website and seeing the cheapest flight and buying it without knowing exactly what they are getting into. Leisure travelers who are either not bringing carry-ons or paying for their carry-ons via internet beforehand seem to be repeat customers. (An unaware traveler who brings luggage to the gate will be sorely disappointed as Spirit charges for ALL extra services. They also charge more for more human involvement. For examples it is more expensive to check a carry-on on the internet rather than with a human. This allows Spirit to staff less employees and boosts their margins.) Baldanza has admitted that they are trying to do a better job of getting the word out there about how Spirit works in order to avoid dissatisfied customers. 

*Spirit offers a $9/month subscription for repeat customers, which enables savings for repeat customers. (Costco)

*Spirit maintains a 30% gross margin which is well above the relevant competitors. Spirit barely has a toe in in terms of market share. Their biggest markets right now are Fort Lauderdale and Dallas right now. This year they plan to add flights in Baltimore, Detroit, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis and Philadelphia for a 22%. If Spirit can continue to steadily, but conservatively expand while keeping its margins intact I would think that would lead a healthy shareholder return.

*The stock currently trades at a trailing P/E of 23.5 which seems expensive, but that doesn’t factor in future growth.  Spirit’s cash from operations has grown from 69 to 195 million between 2009 and 2013. They currently have no debt and a healthy cash cushion. Their fleet is relatively young and they have more in the pipeline. (On a separate note, I believe they only have 1 type of planes which makes it cheaper in terms of maintenance. Employees only need to know 1 kind of plane. They only need parts for 1 type of plane.) 

So those are my thoughts on Spirit and I would love to hear what people think as well as what kind of analysis I can do. Don’t mind taking criticism as well.

"Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM) vs. Globalstar (NYSE:GSAT)
I was just wondering about the massive valuation difference between both Iridium Communications and Globalstar. They are both satellite phone service providers that provide satellite coverage to their big clunky phones literally all over the world. Many of their customers are commercial fishers/government employees/or other people that are away from civilization and regular cell phone towers. Many of their customers require these satellite services to conduct their operations whatever they may be. 

So about this massive price difference: 

IRDM: 

* Annual Revenue of $380 million

* Cash from operations - changes in working capital - necessary maintenance due to depreciation = $120 million in annual ""fcf"" (This free cash flow is normalized)

* $1.05 billion in long term debt

* Has about 68 satellites in orbit right now

* **Market Cap: $575 million (4.8x fcff)**

GSAT: 

* Annual revenue of $83 million growing at like 8% annually

* Has consistently lost money and just reported $4 million dollars in cash used in operations. Then after that, $45 million in capex on $90 million in depreciation.

* $670 million in long term debt

* 36 satellites 

* **Market Cap: $2.75 billion**

So can someone tell me what Globalstar has going for it because I am obviously missing something here. What does Globalstar have that Iridium doesn't? Is Globalstar just incredibly overvalued or Iridium just undervalued or a mix of both?

"What am I missing here?
Ticker Symbol: RICK. Rick's Cabaret. Essentially a chain of strip clubs and adult oriented restaurants. They own most of the real estate. Have a market cap of $102mn. Debt of $85mn, but obviously the real estate is held at cost and they have been acquiring it since 1995. LTM EBITDA generation of $29.6mn, which means they are trading at EV/EBITDA of only 6x(3/31). Buffalo Wild Wings trades at 14x(admittedly no debt). RICKS has an EBITDA/INT PMT ratio of 3.9x.

Worst case scenario, someone comes in, breaks up the company, sell all of the real estate (at $140mn conservatively?), pays off the debt and you are left with a 35% loss assuming you don't get paid anything for present and future cash generation which is doubtful.

But it gets better. The CEO owns 17% of the company so his incentive to perform is there. The management team has expressed a willingness to CONTINUE their policy of buying back shares. In addition, the CEO has paid off debt and used new cheaper debt to open new clubs when it makes sense.  On top of that, during the most recent earnings call they talked about their plans to spin off the real estate into a REIT. I'm still fuzzy on the implications of this but I think at the very least this would save on taxes.

On a side note, they have no unionized employees. In fact, their biggest assets in that of the dancers (no pun intended) are not even employees in every state but one. Even though I have never been to one of these clubs, it seems that they are more professional, create better atmospheres and have better controls than other clubs of that ilk.

Of course there is the glaring fact that these are indeed strip clubs and remain unsavory to the general public. But the unloved industry is exactly why it is so cheap. There are other cons that could arise in the form in unexpected regulations and problems that could arise in specific venues. 

Overall I don't think people are ever going to stop going to adult clubs and RICK's can use their economies of scale to their advantage. They are also diversifying into more sports bar type restaurants. As they become larger  In terms of market cap and as hedge funds pile in the market cap should begin to reflect the true value of the firm.

"Anyone know of any quality companies that consistently throw off free cash flow no matter what economic conditions?
I was just trying to find some more. For me the first one that comes to mind is DaVita Healthcare Partners. (DVA) They own dialysis centers where people with diabetes go a few times a week to get their blood filtered. DaVita's free cash flow will always be there because it isn't like people with diabetes will just stop getting their blood filtered at DaVita's centers during a recession. They literally have to use DaVita's services to stay alive. So that's why DaVita's FCF is very consistent. Anyone know of any other businesses like this? ",2
"easyhome (TSX:EH) Price target $33 (+35%)
Just spoke with an Analyst. He recently raised EH PT from 27 to $32.5. It's a small cap so this is def not for everyone and please do your own research and consult an investment advisor before investing (insert standard disclaimer stuff).

[Link to the research report](https://mega.co.nz/#!tVgX1BzC!PggH-ZM3Me5OE9rOkedx_LxQPxBA_CM1u7950hnCZZQ)

Easyhome operates 2 business lines: 

1) Leasing: rent to own furniture and electronics, 18% operating margin, expected to grow to low 20s%. Majority of the revenue

2) Financing: recently launched, unsecured loans in the $1k to $5k (for borrowers with credit thats not good enough for banks, but they are not desperate enough for pay-day loans). Operating margin in the low 30%, loan book currently growing 65% YoY. Financing is expected to help boost overall operating margins to mid-high 20%.

EH has very low debt. They recently secured a $200mm debt package (~40% Debt to total assets), which will help boost growth. 

The story is very compelling. The mezz debt market in Canada is small and the US banks abandoned their Canadian operations in 2008/2009 (i.e. Citi, Wells Fargo), thus leaving only EH to supply an underserved market. He doesnt think the Big 5 Canadian will enter the market due to the risk and strict capital requirements.

Valuation wise, we are looking at 18x P/E LTM vs peer 19.6x P/E. It's even cheaper for forward valuation (10x vs 21x peer).

If EH can successfully execute the expansion of easyfinancial and grow dividends/buybacks, the stock will have no problem getting to the $30s. 

The analyst drew parallels to Dollarama (the dominant Canadian dollar store). Dollarama had 0 debt, low dividends, high growth. Then the stock really popped when they started buying back shares and increasing dividends, went from $60 to $90 in a couple of months.

"Defensive Investor Analysis of Reliance Steel (NYSE: RS)
I've been reading the Intelligent Investor and this is my first analysis of a company using the Defensive Investor criteria set forth by Ben Graham.  [I have done all of my analysis and saved it to a Google Doc spreadsheet if you'd like to review it.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y_O6Ytq-RMIM-B1AY8zrsQcIKVP9yI6H5MchRjgvyfQ/edit?usp=sharing)

The hang up I'm having is related to the last test based on the current price related to the NBV of Reliance Steel.  I'm not sure what parameters I should be using when calculating this.  I have been trying to recalculate the Serenity Stocks method to learn what factors/items I need to include in my calculation and I'm not able to re-perform their work for the last test.  The standard is as follows: ""Current price should not be more than 1.5 times the book value last reported.""  I'm curious what assets should be included and which should be omitted.  If I include all assets in this testing, then this stock passes all requirements.  However if I only include tangible assets then there isn't enough of a buffer for Reliance to pass.  How important are the Goodwill and Intangible Assets in determining the value of a company?  What are they really good for?",2
"Will XEROX (XRX) move out of it's sideways zone?
XEROX (XRX) started it's up-move in January 2013 at the breach of an important pivot at 7.5. The stock is now at 10.7, with a recent high at 11.15. Returns amount to over 40% from the entry price mentioned previously. Life-time high for the stock is around 64 which was formed way back in 1999.

A general question asked is will this up move take the stock up to it's life-time highs? That's a question better answered with smaller targets & by carefully watching the stock for important pivots over the long term. As of now the stock has taken a break from the up-move, the indication of the break came at the end of August 2013 as market on the chart. Since then we've so far seen sideways action in the stock for 3 to 4 months & more recently some volatile price action too. The original indication for this sideways zone came at the break of $9.82, now the price point has moved slightly to 9.95. This will be an important support that the stock will have to remain above in order to stabilize and continue the up-move. Further supports for the stock are at 9.64, 8.27 & 8.11. The support at 9.64 is strong for the stock & breaking this will put the future of the stock in jeopardy but that does not mean that the stock will turn bearish but it might end up being sideways to volatile for a long while. But below this the support zone at 8.27 to 8.11 is very critical & breaching this will mean that the stock will enter a bear market.

The stock is showing strong resistance at 11.15 which is also the recent high for the stock. Resistance above this price level will be seen at 12.1 & 20.35.

So far the stock is taking a break from it's recent up-move & has turned a little volatile recently but it does not seem to be weakening yet. Forming a strong base here might result in a continued up trend in the stock in the near future. 9.64 will be a critical support level to watch for in the stock at present. ",2
"Reddit February 2014 Big Board stock contest!
Read this first post for the Feb 2014 /r/stockmarket Contest.
 
 
 The Feb 2014 Big Board Contest starts at the opening bell on Monday Feb 3rd 2014.

Important - Please read carefully: IF ONE OR MORE OF YOUR PICKS ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE AFTER THE START OF THE CONTEST, YOUR POSITION WILL BE FORFEITED.

* When you make your picks, please make sure there are empty spaces around them, so they come up in the thread search.

Correct: AAPL - Long (Blank space after AAPL)
Incorrect: AAPL- Long (No space after AAPL)

-Pick TWO stocks, either long, short, that trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange.

-You cannot duplicate someone's exact play (either of them). For example, if someone picks AAPL - Long, you can only pick APPL - Short as long as it is not taken yet. Use the ""Search This Thread"" link as it only takes a few seconds to see if the ticker has been mentioned.

-Get your picks in BEFORE the opening bell on Monday Feb 3rd. You have have until Friday Feb 7th, 2014, to post what your opening prices were, but you should do it opening day or soon thereafter by quoting the post with your picks and then entering your opening price for each stock on the day the contest started. This saves me from looking up the opening price for everyone's picks and saves me a couple hours of work.

-The stock/ETF must close at $2 minimum the day before the contest. **No Indexes or pinks/OTCBB. The Company must have a market cap of at least 500M.**

-You are only allowed 1 leveraged ETF. If you choose two, the second of the two does not count and is still up for grabs. If incorrect picks go un-noticed, you risk your position being forfeited. (These are the 2x/3x ETF's)

-Once you pick something, that is it, it is yours unless it is not a valid pick. This way someone doesn't pick a stock that others want, then at the last second change it. Please don't edit your posts with your picks. If you pick one at a time, just use two separate posts instead of editing your first.

Once again, it is your responsibility to check that your pick is not a duplicate. The ""Search This Thread"" link I mentioned makes this as simple as it can be. If you choose to not check and should you duplicate someone's pick, it will not only not count, but you will be ridiculed and laughed at as well.

You can close out one or both of your picks at anytime by posting the fact you want to close it on the thread. If you state you want to close a position during trading hours (before the closing bell), you will get that day's closing price. If you decide to close a position after the trading day is finished (after the closing bell), you will get the next day's opening price. PLEASE POST YOUR OWN CLOSING PRICES!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask, and if anyone sees someone else messing up, please correct them. Also, please look at your positions after I post the spreadsheets. I try to catch mistakes, in and out of my control, but need your help in making sure the information is accurate. Please PM me if something major needs my immediate attention on this thread - if it is something that cannot be worked out by thread contestants.

Remember...the contest starts at the opening bell on Monday Feb 3rd 2014.

I will be posting a google docs chart to track everyones plays!",1

* INO long - I took a small position today but it wicked me out. Feeling like a sucker buying this way up here as I originally had it on 1/30/14 at $2.59, and got flushed out by 2 cents at $2.39 on 2/5/14. Still watching for day trades if it takes off though. 

* HZNP still holding this flag amid all the chaos. Watching long over $10.40

* YOD long for a continuation day trade

* ACIW short under $55 for a continuation. Check out how to play these here: http://www.greenbartrading.com/2013/03/trade-setup-continuation-short.html

* KOOL long over $2.50. Alert triggered at $2.30 but due to market conditions I didn't execute. It could take off tomorrow. 

Good luck if you're trading! Let me know if ya got any questions.

"What is the worst stock (not a pink sheet) you could purchase?
Hey,

This question has been burning in my brain for years now, because my brother and I are running similar online businesses in separate states, but we each (sort of) have a cap on how much we can invest and often have a bunch of cash leftover. It's our constant running joke to call each other and ...

""Hey ... You should take your cash, sell your inventory and (snicker) BUY STOCK IN (awful, dying business).""

I've picked on Radio Shack, Best Buy and my latest is Seaworld (saw your post a while back on here) and have to wonder (just for comedy's sakes), what's the best way you could take all of your money, put it in a box and ""Poof! It's gone"". I mean, non-OTC stocks would be funnier, but if the answer is ""Sign up for shady e-mails and let the Pump&Dump creepers come your way"" then that's fine.

"American Airlines vs. GM question.
A quick question for all the brilliant stock-watchers out there:  what are the differences in the GM bankruptcy v that of AA from a stock perspective?  I'll give a little background (mind you my knowledge of this sort of thing is very rudimentary). 

Years ago, I bought GM when it was in the shitter and it had an impending bailout. I didn't buy a lot, but did so under the logic that it's an American company too big and important to fail. Upon bankruptcy, I lost all of the shares I had purchased, and did not gain any when GM was relisted under its new ticker symbol. 

I pretty much did the exact same thing with AAL last year. Only, when it was relisted under its new ticker symbol, I was granted shares totaling (in dollars) what I had prior to AA bankruptcy. It's now worth something like 560% what I paid for it. 

Why did I lose my money in one situation (GM), but have my balance transferred at a discount stock price in the other (AA)?  Any insight would be helpful so I can make more educated decisions in the future. Thanks.",2

He's looking at that, knows Buffet isn't exactly an idiot, and was thinking of just buying it and leaving it for a few years. Return of about 125% in five years which is pretty good. 

Being that they own tonnes of companies that can all work together, you are sort of ""second hand diversified"" if you will, but are still in one stock and one number. 

Does this sound logical? The only thing is that it feels ""too easy"" but the track record looks good, and it seems like all that you would need to do is check the stock once a week even to get general trending, sell if you think that it's going to slump a couple percent, grab it on the turn. It doesn't move exceedingly fast in that regard. 

Any thoughts would be welcome!

>MENLO PARK, Calif., March 25, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Facebook today announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, Inc., the leader in immersive virtual reality technology, for a total of approximately $2 billion. This includes $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock (valued at $1.6 billion based on the average closing price of the 20 trading days preceding March 21, 2014 of $69.35 per share). The agreement also provides for an additional $300 million earn-out in cash and stock based on the achievement of certain milestones.


>Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas. Given these broad potential applications, virtual reality technology is a strong candidate to emerge as the next social and communications platform.

Hey everybody, 

just wondering what the general consensus price target would be for Nokia. I purchased these shares pre devices sale at 3.99. And have seen the stock settle between 7.70-8.50 for the last 6 months. 

I'm generally a very patient investor but my patience is wearing thin with this one waiting for it to achieve what I believe is fair value at closer to $10. 

The decision to sell Nokia is one Ive been mulling over daily, I just wanna gauge what this subreddit thinks about Nokia and its prospects.

"I'm issuing a public $10k Challenge. Do you think you can transform $10k into the most money in 2014 through trading? Then come play!
**/r/10kchallenge**  
  
I've created a centralized subreddit for this, and the rules are simple.  
  
1. We start on the first trading day of 2014.  
  
2. **You can include equities you already own,** but only up to $10k worth as of their 2013 closing values.  
  
3. Any asset purchased must be something that can be bought or sold on an open exchange, like NASDAQ or even OTCBB.  The litmus test is this: *Can I buy it through E-Trade*?  If so, it's a legal move.  
  
4. The $10k can be lumped in with the rest of our assets, but we must be honest about our specific moves with the money.  You can't just count the most profitable $10k in your portfolio!  If you make a major move, you should update the other players to keep yourself honest, and keep track of that specific 10k separately as it grows (...shrinks?!?)    
  
5. I made a Sub-Reddit so that if people actually want to do this we don't clog up other boards with chatter.  /r/10kchallenge is born!  
  
Some of you think I'm an idiot, and if so, great!  Take $10k and dedicate it to a Vanguard index fund for 2014 and show me that I'm a moron by beating my speculative returns.  
  
We already have a variety of people competing, and the more the merrier!  It will be fun, *and somewhat stressful!*  No prizes really but bragging rights, but those are worth far more than money.  
  
Hope to see you there!",1
"I noticed a few questions about starting a portfolio so I thought I'd post my recommendations for newbies. Feel free to suggest any changes/additions!
The first thing you’ll need to do is to pick a broker. When you're picking a broker you should pretty much ignore anything they have to say about what you should buy/sell. They are only there to make money, not to help you. Here in Australia, I use a product called CommSec, it's got low brokerage fees, access to many different types of investments and it's very well managed (CommBank is the largest company in Australia by market cap). You want to make sure that your total brokerage fees (buy plus sell) do not add up to more than 2% of the purchase price, otherwise it will take huge chunks out of your portfolio in the long term, you will be surprised how much of a difference compounding interest makes on small amounts over a long period.

Investopedia is good for learning what particular terms mean, for example p/e ratio, PEG ratio, quick ratio etc. But don't use it for anything beyond that.

A good place to start is to steal stock ideas from other people, but make sure you research them yourself before you purchase. I get my ideas from friends, various websites (one of the sites I use is fool.com.au and they’ve got branches websites focussing on US, UK, Canada and Singapore) and from famous investors like Warren Buffett.
I strongly recommend reading anything that Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch has to say on the subject of investing. They're probably the 2 most successful investors in history and you really can't go past their advice. You've probably heard of Warren Buffett, he's the third richest man in the world and he's made his money mainly just from investing in the stock markets. Peter Lynch ran Fidelity’s Magellan Fund from 77 to 90 and averaged 29% per annum compound average returns in this time, exceeding the return of the S&P 500 in all but 2 years in that time.

Avoid stocks that don’t have a history of positive earnings, especially when you’re starting out, these are usually ‘penny-stocks’ they’re highly speculative and it’s all-but-gambling. Referring back to Peter Lynch, he claims to have been successful on 0 out of 29 attempts at picking ‘long-shots’ before he gave up with them.
Particularly for a new investor, ‘blue-chips’ are a great place to start. They might not offer the potential to quadruple your money in a year, but you're much less likely to wipe out your capital with a bad pick. I'm not recommending any of these companies, but a good place to start looks would be companies like:

Ford (F)

Union Pacific (UNP)

General Electric (GE)

Exxon Mobil (XOM)

These are just examples, I haven't actually researched them, I'm just making the point that well established companies with a solid business, good management and a good earnings history should outperform mid-caps and penny-stocks in the long term.

It's important that any stock you're buying has a realistic track to growth. If the company can't grow it will stagnate and even that will lose you money (opportunity cost, inflation cost), but more likely if it's not growing it will move backwards. Reuters will give you a summary of what the analysts think the possibilities for growth are, though as always analysts shouldn't have too much trust put in them so I would recommend investigating yourself and making sure that there's a good plan in place to grow the earnings. Peter Lynch had some great methods for measuring value against growth, I found a couple of free websites that have summaries of a couple of his methods:

http://www.fool.com.au/2013/12/27/peter-lynchs-tool-for-finding-stock-bargains/
http://www.gurufocus.com/news/220155/how-to-construct-peter-lynchs-valuation-charts-with-gurufocus-financials-charts-in-two-clicks

Above everything else I recommend READING. LOTS. Only you will keep your own best interests at heart and therefore you are the best person to be making your own decisions for how to invest your money, but if you're going to do so you need to understand what you're investing in. What can you tell me about the stocks you want to purchase? You should be able to tell me their financial position, prospects for growth, the products they offer, how they compare against their competitors, how effective their management is and more. I could reel this information off about the stocks in my portfolio from the top of my head.

Regardless of whether you rely on [technical analysis](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) or not you should understand how to read a graph and the basics of what it is. The most important tool in this repertoire (imo) is the candlestick graph, I don't even use technical analysis myself but a [candlestick graph](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/121702.asp) is indispensable. It tells you the opening price, closing price, highest price and lowest price of the day/week (depending on settings) as opposed to a regular line graph which only tells you the closing price. A couple of other terms you'll want to read about are [resistance](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp), [support](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp) and [trends](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp). 

You'll want to set a point for yourself when making a purchase which will be your 'get out' point, this will vary depending on your tolerance for risk (you want to be able to sleep at night) and the nature of the investment. For example, I have a very high tolerance for risk and a very long investment time-frame (meaning I've got plenty of time to recoup any losses I make), when I purchase a small/micro-cap stock (or penny-stock as they're known in the US) I'm happy to sit on a 20-25% loss without selling as long as the fundamental reason I invested in the stock is still sound. However someone with a lower risk appetite, and/or someone investing entirely in blue-chip stocks might want to set a [trailing stop-loss](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingstop.asp) of 5 or 6%. I personally choose not to use a trailing stop-loss as I want to make the decisions myself and I'm never away from my portfolio for long enough that I might miss something.  Peter Lynch (you might have noticed I'm a fan of his) reckons if you're a good investor you should get around 6/10 of your stock picks right, so be prepared to have to implement your strategy pretty regularly. 

One last thought, there's a saying in my industry (superannuation, or pension funds as they're known in the US) which I suspect is well known elsewhere - ""It's time in the market, not timing the market"".

Good luck and have fun, investing is fun and highly rewarding if you do it properly

"What to do with PLUG?
-Plug moved up more than 50% on Thursday
-This coincided with an announcement from the CEO that they made     32m in Q4 of 2013, and expect Q1 2014 revenue to meet or exceed that number       
    
I think more people are starting to get on board with fuel cells as evidenced by PLUG's growing list of customers. I'm wondering whether to add more to my position or to simply hold. I think it's important to consider that their current market cap is around 240-250m and if revenues show modest growth, or even continue at their current rate, this may lead to a much higher valuation. It's also relevant to note that as sales revenues grow, so should service revenues. According to [this article](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1925771-plug-some-power-into-your-portfolio-for-significant-upside), PLUG has only realized a fraction of the market opportunity for their technology, and thus I see them as a major growth stock over the next few years. I'd appreciate your perspectives on this stock, as the author of the above article, while bullish, anticipates a pullback from these levels. ",2
"Dumb money talks. Smart money listens.
There's a lot of talk about smart money and dumb money, and which is why. Here's the clear delineator: dumb money talks, smart money listens.

I chatted with a friend of mine on FB last night, just general catching up and whatnot. He knows I work on WS, so when the topic of investing came up, you'd think he'd ask me for any tips, right? Nope--instead he bragged about his past performance and how the looming Malthusian crisis was going to make gold and oil explode in value, hence his big bets on both (not that those worked too well for him in 2013, of course).

Now when I talk to professional money managers, the conversation is the exact opposite. They don't brag about past performance or tell me their investment hypotheses. They want to know what I know. They listen very closely, and ask probing questions. They don't care if they look stupid or smart or good or bad. All that they care about is learning something.

This trend is so common that I've made it an axiom of finance and it determines my own strategies in life: dumb money talks. Smart money listens.

So next time you feel the urge to post about your killer trade or how you scaled 10 cents off of a rally in TSLA, or next time you want to reply to a post telling OP what an idiot he is for thinking X, Y, or Z, just remember:

Dumb money talks. Smart money listens.

I took a look at their website too (http://rapid-fire-marketing.com/) and although it is ugly, it does seem kind of legit to me. Like an actual business trying to bring an actual product to market.

"Need desperate advice
So, this is going to be painful.

I am a relative novice to the trading game. Mostly go long on blue chips and dont interfere much.

Stumbled upon the pot craze slightly late (got the MDBX tip right here .. I lurk often) in the game and made some money off medbox a few days back. Kept watching other stocks go up up, so decided to sell off some of my longs on blue chips and put the money in potstocks (GreenGro, AVTC, PHOT)for a quick hit.

Made a decent profit, and here is when things went horribly wrong.

Tried to book my profits two days ago, but everytime I tried to sell, the warning that I was trying to trade using unsettled funds and that this would be in violation of SEC rules etc would pop up. In essence, no profit booking happened and I have watched helplessly as the in excess of 100% profits have turned into 70% losses.

So I have two questions for those willing to offer advice.

1. Do I sell when I can (Monday possibly) and book losses, or do I wait for 5 ish years and hope that the market takes off again ... 

2. Is it normal that the trading platform would let me buy with unsettled funds, but not sell?

I am all ears fellas ... talking about losses in excess of 10k here ... painful!!! ",0
"Winter & Snow Stock- Compass Minerals (CMP) 130Years old. Largest and lowest cost Salt mine of world in Canada- Largest Mine of UK, Largest mine of US.
All of these mines produce the salt that is used on roads to deice. They haven't been affected by commodity price crash and announced record sales guidance 2 days ago. 

They have increased dividends every year at a rate of almost 10%. 

Earnings are 20% potash from naturally occurring Sulfates of Potash (SoP) derived from cost-effective solar evaporation. It fell from $90 to below $70 when the potash cartel went bust. It was unfair because their potash exposure is so so small and pretty efficient on top of it. 

60% of earnings are from de-icing salt that they supply all over N. america and UK. They have a very big share of the market and hold strong pricing power. At the rate all the salt has been used up recently due to Polar Vortex and all, they should definitely have some top line surprises, future orders and dividend hikes to announce on Feb 6th, when they report earnings.

My history with the stock: I was short on it without any fundamental reason from 82 to 92 and after I covered half of my position, it crashed to 65 on the potash price war scare. I didn't even know they had anything to do with potash. After I realized how little I knew about the company, I did my research and was very impressed.

"Galectin Therapeutics up 60% today, up 102% since investment. When to sell?
First post here, so let me know if this isnt the appropriate place or if changes need to be made. I have little stock experience, so I'm looking for some advice on how to handle a stock that had a decent gain. 

I purchased GALT stock the first week in November when they dipped, and picked up shares at $6.67. Intercept therapeutics had a monster day, up 300% today alone from research news that they have met their target in clinical studies ahead of schedule, and that benefited other therapeutics stocks, triggering the 60% rise GALT saw. At what point should I think about dumping my shares or GALT, or should I hold onto it for the long run? When is it worth to pay the heavy taxes from short term capital gain and sell after owning less than a year, rather than ride it out to pay less on the gains through taxes?

Again, I'm extremely novice with this, with only a handful of finance classes through college. Any clarification, corrections, or advice would definitely help!

"What do you guys think of SJR.B?
Canadian here. SJR.B is Shaw Communications Inc, a Canadian cross-national cable company. They are in heavy competition with Telus (T) who has only joined the home tv space in the past 10 years and has been extremely aggressive and successful in gaining market share (and continues to). Shaw is the oldschool default cable provider and EVERYONE in western Canada used to use only Shaw for cable and high speed internet and they are no longer the default choice.

I was looking at 3 different research analysis reports released by TD, BMO, and Scotiabank, and all seem to agree Shaw will sector perform or outperform. I disagree and think the rate at which Shaw is losing customers to Telus and to IPTV is going to be more than expected. As well, Shaw's pension liability has doubled from roughly $260m in 2010 to $530m in 2013. In 2013 Shaw contributed over $400m to the fund and it is becoming an increasing share of their annual expense.

"Discussion about PLUG before Tuesday's conference
PLUG's shares have increased from $0.12 to over $3.00 since February, 2013. Recent developments include the announcement that they booked orders for $32,000,000 worth of goods and services to customers in Q4 of 2013, and expect to meet or exceed that amount in Q1 of 2014. They have burned through about $20,000,000 in cash in 2013, and have recently raised ~$28,000,000 (after expenses) in capital via an offering of new shares and warrants to an individual buyer in the amount of 10,000,000 shares at $3 each and 4,000,000 warrants to buy more shares (exercisable by January 15th, 2019 upon the share price reaching $4). I'm wondering what investors/traders here on reddit are planning to do next week in advance of the conference on Tuesday. I suspect that the share price will rise substantially, and I base that on my belief that this new offering will allow PLUG to remain solvent in the short term while waiting to be paid for their backlogged and future orders. I expect the CEO to boast about the future to such an extent that new investors want in, and I also expect an update regarding the identity of the investor who purchased the 10 million shares.  ",2

"Wireless communications... has the good time gone?
Hi guys, first time poster, long time researcher and short time stalker of this forum...

I've recently come to the light of the wireless communications sector; not cell phone companies, but rather the R&D firms that back the little chips in our credit cards and all that jazz.  I've noticed a pretty sharp spike in nearly all of them over the past month, and while I'm presently double-dutching around with my investing dollars, I'm wondering if now is the right time to jump on board?

The stocks I'm speaking of, for the sake of not being ""that guy"", here's a few examples: [Brocade](http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/BRCD.aspx), [Ceragon](http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/CRNT.aspx), [Techfaith](http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/CNTF.aspx)",2
"""BP appeal to stop 'fictitious' U.S. oil spill claims fails"". What are your market reaction expectations? I want to benefit from the volatility. Which options look best?
Firstly, I think this is irrelevant to the big picture. When there was news of possible reduction of payments due, the stock didn't benefit from it and without missing a beat it just carried on with an uptrend that started way before the news.

I think reaction to negative news are stronger than positive news. So there is bound to be some weakness tomorrow. I'm thinking of buying some April/June puts to protect against downside, maybe sell for profit in a few days or to just benefit from volatility. 

I own April $48 (+140%) and June $47 (+45%) calls.

I was thinking of selling my April Calls and then buying April $46 puts and 2015 $52.50 Calls",0

"DRWI - Possible breakout in the next month or so.
First up [Chart](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DRWI&ty=c&ta=1&p=d&b=1)

Now on to my reasoning. a few things.  First is the drop back in September on the chart. That was due to a low Q2 earnings report. And the recent Q3 earnings report was not much better, but it was better.  That said, they ""expect solid gross margin improvement starting in Q4"" ^((1)^)

Also in that article, it talks of a deal made last week with ""a major US-based carrier""^((1)^) So its likely that profits will start to show in the next earnings report and will continue to grow in the coming months. 

Secondly, for a deal that was announced this morning, in which the company ""announced the signing of a strategic sales agreement focused on the sale and distribution of DragonWave solutions in The People's Republic of China."" ^((2)^) With this it looks like there is room for growth in the company with this deal. So I would expect the stock to start rising, with a chance to at least double within the next few months.

Was looking to buy into this since two weeks. It's looking like a promising stock (Canadian), from what I can see. I have it targeted at $16, but can see it going much higher, even reaching it's historical highs within 3-5 years. 


TCW's leading position in the Canadian market and improving investor sentiment which may drive multiple expansions. There looks to be multiple expansions to be driven by rising positive investor sentiment around the Canadian frac market where fundamentals/visibility are on the rise. TCW also benefits from overall flow of funds into the sector currently, i think.

Just wanted feedback on what people think of posco. This is a steel company that uses four high end production technologies that are cost efficient, lower production time and are Eco friendly. This company isn't a penny stock and would be a long term investment. They have increased revenues every year, even when the stock market crashed, 56% from last year. Most of the methods for producing steel derive from iron ore which in 2013 hit a low and has been slowly recovering. A new CEO has come into play to bring some change. They have gotten clearance to build a steel plant in eastern India while slowly getting a license to mine in India for iron ore. They have increased their backlog by 40%. Also the main driving point is they have recently bought out fuel cell energy and has a license to sell technology in Asia, which they have started construction as well for a factory to produce these power systems. All in all, it has been profitable for years, shows company expansion in current industry while they investigate new ones, as iron and steel continue to increase in price, so does their profit, warren buffet invested close to 770 million in 2006 and the price has recently gone down to an appropriate level.

""TSLA [38] could be a great play""
