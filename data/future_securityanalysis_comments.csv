t3_1ubci0,cegdwzg,"If EBITDA just turned positive the negative cash flow and earnings are likely due to the top half of the income statement (poor gross or operating margins) not DD&A, Capex or interest. 

I do not invest in companies that have always had negative earnings or have negative normalized operating income, nor would I. 

1. Normalize Earnings: Replace the current earnings (that are negative) with a *normalized earnings* (that is positive). This approach assumes the negative earnings are a one off and will return to normalized (positive) level in the future. 
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
2. Estimate Revenues and Margins: Based on revenue projections over time and estimate operating or net margins. The margins should increase from the current levels (which are negative I assume) to a positive margin or the company is not very successful. The revenues and margins, can be used to estimate earnings. Once earnings turn positive and margins stabilize, valuation becomes more routine.

 An alternative and related approach is to estimate capital invested for future years and returns on capital over time, to arrive at estimates of earnings in future periods. Pretty much guess work and dart throwing when near-term cash-flows are that volatile and you capitalize them 10 years. 

3. Reduce Leverage: When a firm reports negative equity earnings because it has too much debt, (not because it has operating problems) the simplest way to adjust earnings is to reduce the leverage of the firm. This is because (hypothetically) as the firm operations grow over time, and financing charges are lowered (as leverage is reduced), the equity earnings will become positive. (Essentially eliminating interest charges.)

For the benefit of those not in the know, the DCF method is the most important formula known to the modern investing world in the investment decision. It involves extrapolating the future earnings of the business from its current performance, hence deriving the value of the company, or the maximum one would pay to buy its shares. The way it works is like by reverse-engineering this straightforward formula:

e/p = r

Where p is the price it’s worth, r is the rate of return and e are its earnings. Let’s say you have a dishwasher which costs you $100. If you buy the dishwasher and it saves you an hour a day washing dishes, you could theoretically turn around and invest that hour into something productive, like freelance programming or article writing. If you can get $10 per hour from that side activity which you would have otherwise spent washing dishes, you can say that you’ve earned a 10% return per day on your initial investment.

e/r = p

The way DCF works is it reverse-engineers the formula (as above) to try and predict what the future price of the company is worth. Let’s say that by looking at the past earnings of the last 10 years, one forecasts it will reliably carry on producing stable cash flows for the next 10 years, thus giving us the ‘e’. Then, by accounting for certain key risks factors, one predicts the expected rate of return, thus giving us the ’r’. By dividing the two (of course it’s not that simple, I’m just summarizing it), you can forecast a future ‘p’ of the company, and by dividing ‘p’ by the number of shares you can find out the maximum price you’d be willing to pay for each share.

On paper, this seems like a brilliant way to predict the correct share price to buy a share at. However, this formula has a number of issues. Firstly, it is far too simplistic to assume with confidence that a company’s earnings will remain stable for an indefinite amount of time. Too many companies, even untouchable juggernauts the likes of Microsoft, Washington Post and Lehman Brothers, have demonstrated that even the safest of havens can be upset by new developments. Surely there are some whose cash flows have endured, such as the ever recognisable Coca-Cola and insurance giant Geico, but statistically speaking no large company can be considered ‘assuredly safe’ from the ravages of time.

Secondly, the employ of determining ‘e’ is fraught with perils and uncertainties. Let me give you the most drastic example, the valuing of what’s known as real options. Real options represent the potential earnings a company might derive from some asset it currently holds but does not yield positive cash flows from. For instance, let’s say JCP is currently having negative cash flows, but owns a piece of empty land next to it. In arriving at future earnings, you can’t say that the land is completely stagnant because it might be utilized in the future, for example by building an extension to the shopping mall or a new hotel. The valuing of real options employs the Black-Scholes model used to value options and warrants to extrapolate the future earnings of an unused piece of land. Keep in mind that the land is not being used at all, with no future plans to use it; and we are assuming that a model used to value static systems like options can be extrapolated to a dynamic situation like an unused piece of land. A flood could come tomorrow and render it forever condemned for commercial purposes. Even so, the use of real options in valuing a piece of unused property can sometimes exceed the current value of the said property itself! Let’s just put it this way, if I were a billionaire and you presented me with a price for JCP, I would definitely want to know whether you included real options in your valuation.

Lastly, the derivation of future ‘r’ is also no small task. The current method extrapolates the current debt and equity values to provide an appropriate risk profile to determine a reliable rate of return into the future, however what’s to say that the current risks will remain the same 20 years into the future? Look at the history of any newspaper company and you’ll realize how fragile even the largest companies can be. The remedy for that is to provide a range of different ‘r’s to accommodate the possibility of things going awry, however if your company goes bankrupt or loses half its earnings potential, a range isn’t going to be very helpful for your investment.

However, I’m not discounting the DCF method entirely. I’m not trying to villainize it as an impractical formula which has lost its utility in the modern world. I’m simply saying that, given its widespread acceptance and the trust millions of investors place in it, perhaps it deserves a second look. The fact that Warren Buffett did not use it in his younger days, (Alice Schroeder uses the phrase ""decades and decades"") lends credence to the possibility that it may not be all that it appears to be. As someone who has done numerous DCF calculations in the past, I have my doubts on its reliability, especially on small and medium sized companies.

The DCF method is far from being the only culprit in the ‘its-not-perfect-but-its-the-best-we-have’ camp which is unquestionably relied on in the broad finance industry. With a disposable amount of capital this might not be such a big deal, but when the livelihoods of families and entire economies around the world at stake, maybe we should give it a closer look.

I use a similar approach and try to rebuild a company earnings statement to see which business part I get for free. I like free parts which have high upside but have very unreliable cash flows (new product launch, restructuring). The markets tend to be very bad in assessing the probabilities and sucess/fail payouts. 
This approach works similar with business parts which drag the performance of the overall company. The market discount might be higher than negative value of the business part (liquidation value of that part).

t3_1xpps3,cfdkmd1,"Simple questions like this are often difficult to answer succinctly. The proper answer to this question spans multiple books across many disciplines, but I'll try to keep it short.

Intrinsic value is an estimate that falls in a range, not a discrete number. Moreover, this range changes based on the prospects of the underlying business and the biases of the investor coming to the intrinsic value estimate.

Valuation falls under two general types: absolute and relative. In absolute valuation, you discount projected cashflows or earnings of the business to determine intrinsic value (e.g. DCF, Residual Income). In relative valuation, you compare multiples of current or projected financial performance (EBITDA, Earnings, FCF, Book Value, etc.) to that of similar companies to come to your intrinsic value estimate.

Coming to useful intrinsic value estimates requires knowledge across Accounting, Finance, and Strategy at a minimum. You seem like a beginner so that is where you should start. These five books will give you a solid base on how to calculate intrinsic value.

* Competitive Strategy - Michael Porter
* Competition Demystified - Bruce Greenwald
* Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies - McKinsey

Lastly, valuation is a tool that is misused frequently. The books referenced above don't necessarily take into account conservatism and value investing philosophy. There are many more books that address that and the appropriate use of valuation in the Reading List on the sidebar.

I'll push back on whether the trailing P/E of 23.5 account for growth. You have not quantified that. The S&P500's current P/E multiple is about 18 and the current revenue growth rate is 3.6%. The usual no growth rate P/E is somewhere between 7-9x.

While Spirit may be the low cost leader in airlines, there are still structural limitations on how quickly any airline can grow revenue. First there are a limited number of gates they fly out of at any airport. While Spirit can take share away from competitors within markets, and increase their capacity utilization, there is a limit on how many flights they can have per day, thus how many passengers they can accomodate, thus the amount of revenue they can have per market. 

Raising prices is another lever that Spirit can pull to increase revenue. The industry is pretty consolidated and the top 4 US airlines control 70%+ of the domestic revenue passenger miles.

Most of these increase aren't increases in fare prices. They are adjustments in frequent flyer mile programs or increases in baggage fees, or reduction in services offered. No matter how they try to disguise it, those are all equivalent to price increases.

They can also acquire new gates to expand capacity. They should be able to bid higher than other airlines as their margins are wider, but airport gates are subject to long term leases. These leases can be recaptured if they are underutilized, but I'm unfamiliar with the exact dynamics of that [Here is a report from the FAA on airport competition that you can use to get up to speed.](http://www.faa.gov/airports/aip/guidance_letters/media/pgl_04_08b_competition_highlights_2010.pdf) Here's another article about [Virgin Airlines crying to the Feds about how the big airlines are playing dirty with gate access.](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-12/virgin-america-to-merging-airlines-let-us-into-your-hubs) You should definitely study Southwest and their entry into the US market.

3) EBITDA a second/third choice for equity valuation, in my opinion. Look at after-tax EBIT, after-tax EBITDA-MCX if D&A not representative. Capex is significantly in excess of depreciation here. What are they investing in, what is the true MCX requirement (restaurants always downplay true MCX and report half-cycle type figures, so need to be careful).

What do you think is a worst-case scenario? Benjamin Lawsky seems to have some sort of vendetta against the Ocwen companies and Bill Erby so if he never lets up and makes absurd settlement offers that Erby refuses, then what? Does Altisource/Ocwen get banned from buying MSRs in NY (this would be bad since MSRs are sold in bundles and the seller would probably just go to Nationstar or one of the other large non-bank servicers). ***Is there anything worse that could happen?***

Also while it's pretty clear that Lawsky had no idea what he was talking about with his initial letter about Hubzu (which is probably why he took it down from their website), some of the accusations in the current letter, if true, would be pretty damning of Erby.


Even if the above does happen, does that just put us in scenario 1 on pg. 28 from this presentation: http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-32801L/3385091460x0x710729/790e4ff8-5dad-4741-9db0-017e734dfc21/Investor_Day_presentation.pdf

Scenario 1 is still pretty fantastic considering it's still 15% growth combined with a fantastic capital allocator and not requiring much reinvestment into the business leading to large buybacks which should = still greater than 20% CAGR. 

Hubzu also seems like it will provide pretty significant downside on the off chance the MSR business disappears from Altisource because of Lawsky's meddling.

In addition, I would ask if they're simply reporting in USD or actually converting back to USD at some point. 

At the end of the day, I would say that no matter how you look at it, you should have a good margin of safety. This will protect you from many issues including an improper currency value.",2,1414005169,"[['LC', 1]]",LC,111.55000305175781,127.19999694824219

subtract capex which is a big deal for a semi company since its lumpy and big


calculate working capital as a percent of sales and subtract any increase year over year


that gets you free cash flow

t3_2khhje,cllqex3,"1) Use TTM, mention forward and explain why it is expected to change. Analysts are expecting earnings growth of 200% is what it sounds like (Forward dropping 3x versus TTM). Do you agree? Why or why not? I find it best to use actual results for valuation and build from there towards expected. 

2) As sidzap already noted forecast revenues (P*Q) and margins leading to NOPAT + growth CAPEX (growth CAPEX is characterized as depreciation - CAPEX) will give you a starting base for earnings power. 

The sustainable normalized growth rate (ROE - payout ratio) coupled with a regression of 10-year average slope on ROE & payout ratio will give you expected growth on earnings power. I break the phases down in years 1-5, 6-10 and 10-15 using a 10x-15x multiple in terminal value or terminal year FCF divided by WACC - terminal growth (nominal global GDP). 

3) Use a discount rate of 8-12% depending on the risk of the investment cash flows or use company specific WACC or industry WACC (8.61% for semi conductor industry). A sensitivity table would not be a bad idea giving worst case, base case and best case scenarios. Start with 12% discount and lowest growth scenario as the worst case. 

- Finally FCF and revenues are starkly different. Revenue can be growing while FCF is down because of growth in PP&E, inventories, lowered margins etc. You may also want to factor in working capital needs based on the proportion to current sales as they will need to grow working capital (most of the time) in the future if they grow sales. Don't forget to subtract these values from each years owners earnings and LT debt from the total PV of cash flows.

I am wary of the ""switching costs"" economic moat as this industry can be fluid at times and I believe understanding the competitive environment at a little more depth could be insightful.  The ""razor/razor blade"" strategy being employed in the US, I like, and supports the moat thesis.  

Also I do not believe you covered operational performance other than ""EBIT growth"".  It may be worth understanding how the margin profile has evolved over time and the drivers of that dilution/accretion.  In other words, is it more fixed cost absorption on higher sales or less promotional activity.  I would want to understand what a ""normalized"" margin would be in this industry.  I would look at comps in similar markets that are mature because then we can understand and model a ""steady-state"" cash flow.  

Lastly, on the FX side, I would high level think of it as what currency are sales based in and what currency are expenses based in and the respective proportions (obviously there is a mix on the revenue side).  Once I understand the mix then I could more easily back into or rationalize the hedging program.

So, it appears to me that they are expecting cash interest cost of $270MM, not $122MM.  Without the synergies, interest coverage is only about 1.5X.

You say that ""it would be tough to imagine conditions that result in a 2/3 reduction in earnings.""  Actually, it does not seem tough at all to imagine this.  This is a very low margin business - gross margins are less than 10%.  It would only take a very small change in gross margins to reduce EBITDA to below their cash interest cost.  In this very cyclical industry, these sort of changes to gross margins have occurred repeatedly.

You also can't treat EBITDA minus cash interest cost as being = to earnings.  At  a minimum, you need to also deduct maintenance capital expenses.  Management doesn't specify what they expect, but capital expenses for the two companies have been running about $100MM annually.

Right now the battle for newspapers is can growth in digital start to make up for the decline within the core biz. My thoughts are that if investors are comfortable that the rev line is at least stable, then people will start to focus on valuation. That's just my gut feeling and it's for the industry overall since there have been huge percentage declines in newspaper revenue going back to '08. When you do your DCF, I would definitely spend a great amount of time on your worst-case scenario. How much can they realistically cut the compensation line and what makes up 'other opex' (a quick scan of the 10k didn't give me much info). Newsprint/ink are mainly variable, but if those other two lines are more fixed then that could be a problem. If the advert rev line keeps decreasing and those costs are mainly fixed (or would take longer to cut), then EBIT will get hit hard; & thus their debt load really comes into play.

I just used the last 10k (so not really LTM), but it looks like it's trading at around 6x ev/ebitda? I would guess that newspapers should trade within the 7-8x range or so. For Lee, I would use a discount to this multiple b/c they don't have (unless I missed it) any big metro major newspapers.

t3_329zhg,cqb05rm,"Here is a blog post from a HF Analyst on WallStreetOasis on the topic: 

Business Description

No matter how simple the business appears to be on the outside, I always go into researching a new business assuming I know absolutely nothing because chances are I do. On the cover page alone, I'll always highlight a few things: fiscal year end, headquarters location, and shares outstanding/market cap if included. Simple stuff, but I still do it no matter what.

Moving on, business description is the first portion of every K. Things that are surprisingly important to me include the history of the business and any historical changes in the company's defined reportable segments. The way a business perceives its moving parts is really important to understanding what they consider important. Sometimes management will decide to move from functional segmentation to geographic segmentation (or the other way around), or might simply consolidate segments or anything similar. I always want this in mind before I get into the granular aspects of the business so I have a frame of reference for how management looks at their own business. If I end up disagreeing it could be an interesting angle if we end up doing something activism-ish or if this may be a short candidate.

I always read the Business section in its entirety (note: I read every section in its entirety to be honest). Besides the things I've already mentioned, the obvious things to focus on are revenue breakdown by whatever segmentation they choose, key business relationships, and key business risks. The main things I'm trying to answer in this section are:

1) Where is the crown jewel of this business? I want to identify the cash generator/main earnings driver for the company. Most of the time this isn't going to be the same segment as what I'm looking for in #2, but it's very important to understand what the majority cash generator is for the company. Normally a company can't survive long enough without its bread and butter to develop any high-growth areas, so determining the key risks to it are just as significant as determining the catalysts to the explosion of another segment.

2) What is the major growth generator? Having a cash cow is great, but doesn't make for a compelling investment if it's growing top line at 1% annually. Normally management will make a point to highlight any major growth in a particular segment, but then again sometimes they won't. Always have this question in your mind when you're looking through segment information. If sales as a % of revenue have moved up from something like low teens to mid-thirties over the past few years, all the sudden you may have a good idea of where growth is coming from... or where a segment will have to pick up the slack as a crown jewel business starts to wither away...

3) Where are the key risks for #1 and #2? Section 1A will always list the risks to the business. A certain chunk of business risks seem identical in every company and can probably be skimmed, but firm-specific risks can be very important and disclose some important information. The things you can usually glaze over include the standard ""macroeconomic conditions"" clauses, litigation risks (unless it's a litigation-heavy business like a medical supplier, car company, airline, etc.), and key man statements. Specific things to look for might be in regards to expansion plans re: the growth engine and market share or other revenue losses re: the crown jewel. Management will usually outline what they think is scary about both of these things, and that will help you build a foundation for what you need to go out and investigate after you're done reading the K.

Properties

Skim through them, but usually not a big deal because there should be no surprises here. If it's a retailer and they provide historic square footage numbers, it's helpful to see how square footage has grown and you'll probably want to evaluate sales/sq. ft. over time to see how if the business has been able to grow its store base in an efficient way.

Commitments/Contingencies (i.e. Litigation)

Again, not particularly important for most but sometimes in lock-step with the business risks section, management might highlight a certain lawsuit or risk of lawsuit that could be make or break for the company. In those cases, obviously focusing on this section becomes a must. But when Kohl's has a $12M lawsuit hanging over its head in regards to a black woman's discrimination lawsuit after she got fired for shoplifting, you probably don't need to spend too much time figuring out what's gonna happen with that one.

Market for Equity / Selected Financial Data

The market for equity section should be pretty straight forward, and chances are if you decided to take a look at the company you already know where their stock has traded recently and if they have a dividend. Other times though you might want to at least skim over this to see if there could be any plans for a dividend or discontinuation of a dividend. Usually one of the more unimportant sections to me (except maybe Mine Safety Disclosures, haha).

Selected Financial Data is your first look at the actual performance of the business. I don't spend too much time here but I like to get an idea of the recent growth trends on the important line items, a sense of the margins at a high level, and anything particular that sticks out, like enormous one-time charges or a year where all the sudden everything fell off a cliff. These are really just things that quantify our idea of business risks, and hopefully we'll see these addressed later in the MD&A or footnotes. If not, we have some phone calls to make...

Management Discussion & Analysis

This, along with the notes to the statements themselves, are pretty much the bulk of the K for understanding what the hell is going on with a business. I spend a good amount of time scrutinizing this section and tend to re-read it once or twice before I feel like I'm actually done with that particular K. This is where the management team will outline their strategy and give a breakdown of what happened during the fiscal year. It's not uncommon for this section to be a way for the company to explain away their failures, or to pump a successful plan.

While I think this section is different for every company, the big things to watch for in getting acquainted with the way the business runs are 1) the important operating metrics that management uses to gauge performance, 2) any non-GAAP accounting that you might otherwise come across in an earnings release and be confused by, and 3) understanding the cash position of the business and seeing where any cash burn might be coming from. I always find myself playing the role of operator of a competitor, trying to scrutinize management's positions on everything they explain and coming up with a list of questions - no matter how basic - that I might have if they're still unanswered by the time I finish the annual report. This section also helps for providing some outlook and giving you better visibility/confidence in any projections you might make for an operating model.

- What makes this business different
- Margins for the industry
- Liquidity and credit outlook
- Business segment breakdown (sometimes)
- Geographic breakdown (sometimes)
- Business structure (sometimes)

I agree that you'll never get to look that deep into the machine. You'll also never get the answers fed to you.

I think the comment about Buffet is both right and wrong. I obviously don't know him, but I'd wager he learns the business, gets a good idea of what questions he wants to ask, and then asks the right people the right questions to learn what he needs to learn.

In 1989, the company was earning 22% on their previous investments, but had access to new investments which would earn them a higher rate of 59%. More succinctly, the return on investments at the margin (59%) was higher than the weighted average return of the entire portfolio of investments (22%). As the company's hurdle rate was undoubtedly lower than 59% they created massive value by investing new capital in new opportunities.

I don't know anything about Coca-Cola or why this might have been but it doesn't seem implausible. For instance (as an illustration - no idea if this reflects the reality) - absolutely massive economies of scale meant that each additional dollar expanding Coca Cola's market had a great positive return (as the marginal cost of producing goods was very low and falling).

In the second part of his analysis he is arguing that Coca Cola's opportunities have dried up and that despite their fantastic ROIC on current investments of 72%, the ROIC of new investments would be lower at only 9%. As such, the growth opportunities are not attractive and pursuing them won't create additional value (as their hurdle rate is presumably at or above 9%, though he isn't explicit on this point).",7,1435816014,"[['ROIC', 2]]",ROIC,15.789999961853027,16.25

EV/EBITDA works in many cases but not always (for example inflated earnings).

t3_3hi5zf,cu8y4xc,"ROIC (NOPAT / Invested Capital) is a good metric for most businesses, but not for financial services companies (particularly banks).  Why?  Well, you first need to understand why ROIC is a good metric for most businesses.  Most businesses try to raise capital (debt and equity) at competitive prices and then use that capital to buy assets at below competitive prices.  Said differently, most businesses pay relatively competitive risk-adjusted rates when raising capital (debt and equity) and then turn around and try to invest that capital at risk-adjusted rates that are higher than their investors could get elsewhere.  All of the emphasis is on the left-hand side of the balance sheet, i.e. investing capital at higher than competitive rates.  ROIC measures the rate of return the business is earning is on what it invests; so it is focused 100% on what happens to the capital once it's raised - on the left-hand side of the balance sheet.  This is sufficient for most businesses.  Financial services companies, on the other hand, and banks in particular, not only try to invest at above average rates, they also try to source capital at abnormally cheap rates.  In fact, I would argue most of the emphasis for banks is on ""creating value"" via the right-hand side of the balance sheet.  Because of deposit insurance and too big to fail (among other things) there's a large subsidy given to banks by the government on the capital raising side.  Deposits are abnormally cheap and debt capital has an implicit government guarantee.  Only banks can raise capital at such cheap rates.  So banks make most of their money (i.e. their economic rent or value add) from sourcing capital cheaply as opposed to investing it really well.  Ergo ROIC doesn't really help in evaluating a bank.  ROE on the other hand, measures both sides of the balance sheet at once.  Embedded in ROE is the answer to two questions: 1) How well did the company invest it's money?, 2) How cheaply did they raise that money in the first place?.  So if a company (read: bank) is ""making money from both sides of the balance sheet"" the best metric to use is ROE.  Understanding this should also help you understand why banks have so much more leverage than most companies.  It's because the more capital they raised from ""subsidized"" deposits and ""implicitly guaranteed"" debt, the cheaper their capital is.  They're incentivized to load up on debt.  This privilege is only available to banks; so other businesses are not incentivized to load up on debt in the same way.  ",3,1440031387,"[['ROIC', 4]]",ROIC,16.989999771118164,16.520000457763672

t3_3jdbj4,cuosqh9,"Hello,

I am not as familiar with this industry so you'll have to forgive my naivete.  But I do have a few questions:

(1) You don't provide these data in your analysis but the company has about 1% of its receivables outstanding as allowance reserves.  Their net charge offs every year consumes the entirety of their allowance reserves.  Don't you think this is a bit imprudent?  Many other financing companies tend to reserve more than a single year's worth of net charge offs.  Particularly for a company that engages in subprime auto loans you would think they should reserve more.  If the market turns they may run into massive liquidity issues from under-reserving.

(2) Their non-recourse notes payable, which has swelled to approximately of ~$7.5B of their balance sheet, is predominantly in the form of fixed-rate long term loans.  That's fine while interest rates are low, and spread income may actually improve with rising interest rates.  But what happens thereafter?  How will the firm manage asset-liability mismatch?

t3_3l4ojn,cv38nbe,"At the end of the day, Wynn’s intrinsic value hinges upon what you think will happen in Macau:

I personally don’t think Wynn Macau is worth anywhere close to $90/share based on an earnings multiple at this point. I think both the EBITDA figures and the multiple of 12x you use are a little aggressive given the possible downside from current prices. Worst case scenario I have Wynn Macau + Encore doing around 600m in EBITDA for 2015, base case around 650m. Palace is opening first quarter 2016, but so are a number of competing resorts: Studio City (Melco) is opening October 2015, MGM’s casino is expected to open for the summer of 2016, LVS is also building a number of properties on Cotai. 

I cannot realistically see revenue and EBITDA figures stabilizing or recovering given the sudden influx of supply combined with what I expect to be continued implosion in demand due to 1) continued economic sluggishness on the mainland, 2) reluctance on the part of the Chinese noveau riche to show off their wealth in light of the anti-corruption campaigns (though they do seem to be dying down a bit) and 3) continued crack down on junket and money laundering in Macau. Now it is hard to get relatively reliable figures on how much of gambling revenues is from corruption / money that is being laundered, but it is reasonable to suspect that a material portion of revenues from VIPs is from that source (and 2/3 of Macau gaming revenues come from VIPs, only 1/3 from mass market). I have base case 2016 EBITDA figures of around 460mn for Wynn Macau + Encore properties and another 280m for Palace (300m annualized). I can see EBITDA for Wynn Macau + Encore possibly declining to 300m, depending on what the party decides to do from now till Spring.  Slapping a 8x multiple on the base case figure gives us a valuation of 6bn, which of course does not take into account the debt. Even with a 12x multiple, valuation would only be around 9 bn. With net debt at around 4bn, equity value would only be around 5 bn, x72% which is around $36/share. 

The thing is I've found the actions of the Macau government (and party) in the last couple of months peculiar in that they seem to have been intentionally and counter-intuitively hostile to the industry. For example:
 
1) The anti-smoking legislation that it is looking to pass, for instance, treats casinos more strictly than any other ""semi-public"" area.  Smoking lounges are allowed in airports and similar places.  But in Macau, the gvt originally approved plans under the new law for smoking lounges in certain areas, subject to sufficient protection for employees.  After many casinos spent substantial amounts of money complying with the new rules , the Government performed a policy U-turn just days before the new law became effective, and declared that no smoking would be allowed anywhere, not even in smoking lounges (many of which had been built in reliance of the previous Government position). 

2) Operators have also been building new properties, many on reliance of specific Government assurances on its approvals for them to run certain numbers of table games. These assurances were repeated to investors and financiers when feasibility studies were being drawn up and approved by the gaming companies, and massive amounts of money were invested on the basis of those assurances. However, again, recent moves by the Government have seen official support and permissions to run games strictly curtailed in those casinos which are now coming to completion, in many cases entirely destroying the carefully calibrated financial viability of their operations and jeopardizing both returns, but also jobs and possibly also social stability.

3) On a similar note, the Government's aim of creating a broader, general tourism-based economy is laudable, and brilliant for all concerned, but cannot ever happen without massive additional investment in infrastructure - in particular, transport infrastructure (Macau has a very underdeveloped public transport system).  But Government revenues to do this come primarily from gaming tax - so the massive drop in gaming revenues will ultimately make the goal of a more diverse economy even harder to attain.  After all, VIP gamers don't need to use public transport, but most other tourists, coming to visit the other entertainment offerings in Macau, would. And right now it really is no fun at all trying to get around Macau other than by car...  

It's quite hard to analyze a situation when 1) the party has so much influence over the outcome of said situation, and 2) their actions don't seem to make much sense from an economic point of view.

* While NAND and DRAM use has grown dramatically in that time, one company's NAND/DRAM is typically as good as another's, so Micron's ability to capture profit depends on what others are doing on pricing and how supply and demand are changing.

Really good write up yet again. I've been meaning to post something after seeing your KMX write-up, but work full time/school is a time killer.... I really need to step my game up haha.

Anyways some questions I have about MN:

1)I question if the 17% delinquency+33% increasing+13% current and same balance really create a strong argument that there is money shifting to be invested in a meaningful way. Wouldn't the delinquent+increasing balance just net out the decreasing amount of loans?

2) I think you do a really good job in debunking parts of the bear thesis, but it is hard to ignore the ETF revolution. I think its really naive to just assume they will mozy on with mid teens CAGR in AUM w/o something drastic changing. I can believe maybe 4-6% driven by asset increases (bond/equity average I guess), but I don't see them actively taking share from other firms without some kind of reason. 

3) The family of funds seems to be in this decent but not good category. The bronze rating isn't exactly stellar, and the funds reputation doesn't seem to be the like of Janus/GAMCO/Eaton Vance etc... Even if it isn't that great. I just don't really see what makes this business lasting at all. Yes it might do good for a few years, but I believe that when change comes, it usually comes very quickly. I just don't see what the quality of the business is here, I think it is clearly undervalued, but it seems to me to be a really crappy family of funds. But why have they grown AUM so fast? I guess I would like to know a bit more about the company's dynamics and business attributes, but I think this is more a flaw of the style write-up than anything else. Personally I want to know more about the business I'm investing in, because I don't really see the support for MN to grab share hand over first that supports your bull case. 

4) The valuation confuses me. I personally think doing a bull/bear/base case and then averaging the results is contrived. I personally think you should do your best to pitch the base case as you see it, and use the bull/bear as a framing device for worst and best case scenarios. Averaging all 3 outcomes seems unrealistic, because they don't seem to be equally likely. I believe the base case is strong enough as is to be compelling regardless, and the valuation is there. 

5) Bias? I think the company truly is an asymmetric opportunity, but I think there are some levels of bias that creep in. I think it is really crazy to assume they will maintain the 78bps they have while the whole industry has been trending downwards for years. I believe that maybe while writing the company up you may have let a little bias creep in, and making the base case a little more optimistic than reasonable. In my opinion I see this even in a lot of great investor's pitches of kind of unreasonable assumptions creep in, which makes a company that is undervalued by 30-50%, go to undervalued by 100%+. I also think you should account for the fact that you are counting your AUM growth to a high point from a trough. If you assume that AUM will recover from the tech bubble/2008 crisis that is really aggressive, considering we are definitely FAR from the tech bubble or crash in any way and would still be considered the middle/late stages of the market. Maybe assuming AUM growth incorporating a full cycle would be best, IE AUM growth from 2006-now as the basis, which allows for a full cycle to be reflected instead of just from the absolute trough. 

Regardless this is a really good write up, but I definitely disagree w/ some of the core assumptions. But that is what makes investing fun and I hope you know that I'm definitely doing my best to ""grill you"" so you can either 1) strengthen your thesis even more by refuting me or 2) adjust the thesis by being intellectually honest and creating an even better opportunity.

At one point in time, i completely agreed with you, and just focused on the underlying. They should be temporary effects, and should go away eventually in the longer term. There is a good reason to believe that since the rest of the world is growing faster than us (just structural factors such as population, increasing productivity, longer lifespan), that the dollar should deprecate in the extremely long term relative to them and actually be a tailwind overtime...

However you should be note that even though it doesn't impact the core business, there is extremely crazy impacts and just ignoring the FX impacts all together is insane. Look @ the BRL/USD. It depreciated like ~70% against the dollar, and large portions of the extremely important Brazilian ag market paired with ag cycle has crushed a lot of agriculture atm. Another thing that is important to note is that even though it won't impact core, currency movements can happen for very long periods of time and effectively make foreign subsidiaries big zeros (Think Venezuela, argentina, other hyper inflation). We can't control this as investors, but it is still our job to assess/navigate the risk involved.

>Q: How should we think about valuing the operating businesses, the insurance businesses, and the float?

>A: Buffett: “Geico would be valued differently than Gen RE and other insurance businesses because it’s rational to assume a large underwriting profit and significant growth. You cannot say that about many insurance businesses. I would love to buy a new bunch of operating businesses with similar competitive positions to the ones we own now at nine to ten times pretax earnings.” 

>[Ding, ding ding! This was the one answer that caused me to almost jump out of my chair. To my knowledge, Buffett has never been so specific about what he would pay for a business – and by extension, what he thinks Berkshire is worth. If you apply a 10x multiple to the approximately $4.5 per B share that Berkshire earned (pretax) in 2011, and add it to the $65 in investments on the balance sheet at year-end in 2011, you get $110 per share. And of course, the investments should be worth more than their carrying value, the insurance business is unquestionably worth more than zero, and 10x is the price Buffett said that he would pay for Berkshire-like non-insurance businesses – which implies they have a materially higher intrinsic value. The bottom line is that Berkshire’s overall intrinsic value is well north of $110 per B share, which means that the current $80 market price per B share is one heck of a deal.]

t3_41hjhe,cz2jkef,"Hola amigo. An approach I like to take is examining margins in the past 5-8 years and observing where last years was with respect to different statistics (max, min, median, etc.). From here, I observe the amount of time between last years (or LTM) performance with respect to each of the aforementioned. 

For example, I examine HypotheticalCo LTM @ 9/30/2015. I examine GM (+ COGS components; eg, rent, inventory), SG&A % revenue, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, etc and see where each cost item is relative to the *most* (max) the company has paid for each expense item. If HypoCo is at its lowest expense structure during the LTM with respect to the last 8 years for lets say...SG&A, i can assume that I probably can't assume much margin expansion in forward projections (or utilize this perspective w/ respect to base case, bear case, bull case)

If I'm quickly modeling a company, I'd set base case margins ~ median of last 8 years (or 5, or 3); bull case to 75th percentile, bear case to min and extrapolate potential projections & create a quick and dirty future share price analysis on the basis of those outputs (can be helpful too examining vs. historical valuations; ev/ebit, p/e). Or, another approach is interpolating margins to the aforementioned median/max/min in 3-5 years.",2,1453107308,"[['GM', 1]]",GM,28.90999984741211,29.59000015258789
t3_41xkz1,cz60f2y,"I don't know about some of these assumptions.

I have done a lot of game theory discussion about Saudi Arabia, and it really seems to me a lot of their incentives is to pump baby pump. And it's very similar to nat gas in 2012, the price isn't going to collapse to the average marginal cost, it's going to just go to market share of the lowest cost producer and the price can continue to go down.

Also another part that is doubtful, capex went down last year, rigs went down last year, and this ""production cliff"" just doesn't seem to be coming. Also from what I understand PXD is still drilling.... There seems to be so many companies still budgeting capex on their break even oil of 50 dollars a barrel, when in reality capex should be zero. So to me it seems that supply may still manage to stay this glutted for a long time going forward, with bankrupt companies having no option left but to drill, a motivated and powerful lost cost producer willing to push it down (Saudi), and an addition of another low cost producer in Iran. Your only way to debunk this is betting on open war, and I just think that seems to be rather speculative (as is my post).

It seems to me that this is most similar to natural gas in 2012. Back then people said oh the marginal cost is 7 dollars, it'll eventually get there. But technology improved (and it still seems to be improving, rig count has dropped but production per rig may have increased), and market share just shifted to the lower cost producers and now we are seeing producers with 2-3 dollar natural gas and the end is not in sight.

I am really hesitant to say shorting e&p, just one thing could rip you out of your position. I think equity e&p is outright insane, and honestly the best bet is energy debt on companies that are less insane than others. Me personally I think this really solidifies that oil is right now uninvestable, and that in the long run commodity companies will make very little value, so why bother? I try to focus my efforts on less cyclical industries.

Feel free to rip my argument to shreds, I'm always a fan of opposing viewpoints and intelligent discussion.

How do you come up with these figures? Historical? Why double why not triple? Do you mean 10% rate or 99% rate? How do you know the accuracy of the rate? Are they just guessed? Is it what management says in the ks and qs? Is it off of another presentation from another brokerage? How do you know the accuracy of these.

Two things....First, I'd like to apologize for my incompleteness in not reading the actual write up...yet. This is always an excuse and a poor one. I got some time I the car later today so maybe later. My answers are probably in there. This is my shortcoming right now as i have other things to do. 


Second, not to pick on you specifically. I always find write-ups a bit to generous to things like FCFs and DCF. Charlie Munger says they dont even do them. Then assigning a multiple to that? I dont know...when you assign a multiple that the market is ""suposed"" to pay based on that analysis. It jsut seems shady to me that the market is expected to pay whatever times something. Maybe the market wants to pay 0x something...that seems just as likely as any other number to me. 

Sorry my comment is more of a meta analysis of the profession than one actually about your write up.

Edit: And again to be completely honest and stress that I'm not picking on you but I tend to just absolutely disregard the whole upside/downside sections of write-ups. Even that stupid bot someone put on this subreddit sucks. Only once you've determined value should market price ever be looked at. 8% downside? Ive seen a number of securities half then double triple or even 10x after theyve halved. Theres a lot that go to 0 and never come back so to say that you only see 8% downside risk seems awfully bold.

On Thesis/Investing: Is it really that safe from the housing cycle? I think a lot of fear is kind of buying peak earnings, and I see you have sales going back to 2009 but what was the 2008>2009 drop? Also what changed to make it magically make money again and why is that not going to come back? It seems like a business with very low margins in a cyclical industry at what is a very hot time in housing with huge macro fears internationally etc. Just defaulting to NAHA is easy, but very weak to me. I am always skeptical of ""upward trend"" of just projecting growth into the future, and I am sure that those numbers could get crushed if macro went south. I guess I would want a stress test on macro, see why it is reasonable, have a more bearish bear case, and maybe a more conservative base case. I just hear a company in an industry like this and kind of shrink back because I really don't see anything that leads to sustainability. What if the market turns really hard, homebuilders are scraping by and they are like screw it we use SKUs from somewhere else because they are just cheaper? I don't really understand what makes it a good decision/value proposition of this company to its customers, but I have a lot more of a focus on business analysis than valuation than most typical analysts.

Other than that it seems like a typical ""fine"" pitch mechanically, but I still question the weak points there. Could you also address the operational margin here as well? I think that really is the make or break for companies like this, and that what swings it from a NI margin of like 1% to -1%. 

Also maybe the company has the NOL priced in. I don't really know how to explain this well but maybe it is kind of priced in one time (I really doubt anything is priced in at ~100m), and that your terminal value pretty much will change significantly one the NOLs run off. Don't really know haha.

Personally get skeptical when thesis's are built on IR conversations. Just me though, I know people have varying levels of trusting for management. 

Oh and valuation. Could you do a bear case valuation when multiple contracts, I know its really conservative anyways but still maybe a thought to have.... Also why 7x. Seems random compared to comps, maybe look at a normalized P/FCF number.

Haven't looked into this much, but one higher-level comment: your thesis is partly centered around a small change in opex margin levering into a large change in NI margin, with one of the two main factors being low diesel prices. Fuel prices are really volatile, though, so even if the expectation is for them to stay below average the probability distribution might include a reasonable likelihood of a wild swing, potentially leading to a large corresponding swing in NI per your thesis. Might be worth adding a couple tables showing the effects of different fuel price / driver wage levels on the opex margin and NI margin to give a sense of how things turn out over the range of possibilities.

t3_469nfa,d03e8vx,"So there are basically two factors going into this. The first is that some of these central banks are conducting an expansion of the money supply in order to keep the interest rates low. A higher supply of money relative to the real economy should lower short term interest rates, but will also depreciate the value of each of those units of currency. The second factor at play here is that investors tend to seek the highest return and want to invest at the highest rate possible. Many investors will choose to invest their money in countries who offer higher rates on similar investments. To do this the foreign investors will need to exchange their currency for the currency that they wish to invest in which spurs demand for the currency with the higher domestic rates. All of this assumes free flow of capital and that there are similar investment opportunities in both countries.

t3_4boj7w,d1ce68o,"On this topic. I always wonder why people consolidate the company and the investor as the same in WACC analysis. The investor is separate from the company so that if the investor can purchase the tangible capital of a company at a lower cost than the company itself it should be a benefit to the investor. As an investor I care principally about the returns on my investment and secondarily about the returns on investment of a company I am invested in. 

If I can buy a company at 4.5x free cash flow which pays out 75% of cash flow per year and puts 25% if cash flow back into its crapco division (for maintenance capex and working capital requirements) which has a ROIC of 2.5% but a declining growth rate in free cash flow of 10% per year (calculating the 10% decline as a decline from the previous year not from the original year and calculating growth net of ROIC). In most cases a company in a declining industry will be able to free up a lot of excess capital (a la Berkshire Hathaway circa 1964.) So if capital reinvestment requirements are maintained at 25% of cashflow the total return on investment assuming an arbitrary 50-50 breakdown between working capital and PP&E and also assuming PP&E can be sold for only 10% of its tangible worth calculated by dividing FCF by the 2.5% ROIC amount and also assuming net working capital can be received for 80% of face value. Assuming the operations last for 10 years and the remaining assets are given away to charity: the total return on investment per year for an investor (but not the company) is about 15% per year. So although the growth rate is negative and the ROIC is 2.5% the investor still makes a great return on his/her own investment. 

An investor would have to pay a price of more than 6.75 in order to have a return of only 10% per year under this scenario. Much of the return from this investment is from the return of capital to the investor through the slow liquidation of NWC and PP&E. 

If a business consists of 90% working capital and 10% PP&E and the recovery of working capital is 100% and the recovery of PP&E is -30%. Then the investor at day one would receive a 20% return on investment if the starting ROIC is 2.15%.

Some may apply it differently, but in my understanding, it seems the MOS is the percentage difference between the valuation and the market price. So a $50/share market price that is believed to have an intrinsic value of $100 would possess a 50% margin of safety (100-50)/100. By that equation, then, a 50% MOS position would need to double (ie increase by 100%) in order to reach the estimated valuation. Does that make sense, did I explain it well?

As for the calculation itself, you can apply it a few ways, depending how you want to work the math: 

1) MOS is something that is derived from your perceived valuation and the market price. Example, perceived value is $100/share and the market price is at $50/share. Estimated MOS would be (100-50)/100 = 50%

2) Desired MOS is stated at the outset and applied to the market price to arrive at the desired purchase level. Desired MOS = 50%. Current market price is $100/share. $100*50% = $50, so at or near $50/share is when you'd start to seriously consider taking a position

3) In a ""looser"" sense, separate intrinsic value from speculative value and ""bargain"" with Mr. Market on the speculative value. Maybe you believe in a different outcome of events? How would that translate through the accounting and how might the market respond to this news? The goal here is to find situations that create a sizable MOS between *your* estimations and what the *market* seems to be anticipating. ""The fundamentalist observes prices in order to learn what others think rather than to determine his own thinking.""

t3_4cf1ra,d1iz5ih,"I'll answer the question in a round-a-bout way:

So you build your valuation model and price the security. Say it's $100. You want to buy at an x discount to that (depends on a variety of things, really, but I typically use 67%). So now I'm willing to buy the stock at $67 per share, which would yield a 50% return (I'm rounding) if it were to get to intrinsic value. However, the stock should be worth more next year - depending on growth, and a host of other factors. But let's view this as a steady state, no growth business (like a bond) that yields $10 per share. So now you would add $10 to your valuation (which you now have in cash) and it's worth $110. Now your margin of safety is wider if the stock's still at $67.

Now, in the model building there's a few ways you can do this if you NPV it out. You can use a discount rate and then apply the discount at the end. Or you can just use your required return immediately. I typically use 10% as my discount rate to value it and multiply that by .67 in order to get the price I'd buy the stock at. However, I could just as easily use 15% as my discount rate and say that's where I'd buy the stock.

Now, allow me to share some constructive criticism. Firstly, I don’t think this company lends well to a liquidation scenario. Shareholder activism in Asian countries is pretty much frowned upon as unpatriotic. Eastern culture is an order of magnitude less combative and tends to value what is unsaid over what is said, and as a result there is a lot of misreading between the lines. A takeover and subsequent corporate exercise will paint you as a robber baron in a world where everyone stays neatly behind the lines and refrains from calling others out on their actions, preferring instead to resort to passive-aggressiveness. Even if it was technically appropriate, you’ll expect to see a lot of pushback from various parties involved in the liquidation process.

Secondly, you may have no reason to be aware of this, but Ragnarok Online has an entrenched history in South Korean video gaming culture – it’s basically a household name to the man on the street. Buying up the company and liquidating it would be akin to someone buying Coca-Cola and destroying the brand stateside. Not equivalent, but you get what I’m saying. You will literally see angry mobs crowding outside headquarters demanding things to be restored to normal, and the media will feed any such activist shareholder to the sharks - particularly a foreign one. People will boycott the game long before any liquidation exercise can be completed. 

As a result, the company would be much better off valued using a DCF analysis. This is also partly because Ragnarok/Rose Online (haven’t heard of the other two) get most of their value from the network effect. If most of my friends are playing Ragnarok, I wouldn’t go to some no-name subscription-based game just because it’s cheaper. At the same time, the value of the no-refund status of the deferred revenue can’t be easily extracted without affecting the value of other related assets.

Lastly, when Gravity says that “revenue recognition does not take place until the customer utilizes the service provided”, I don’t think they mean that “they cannot recognize the revenue until the customer utilizes the purchased item in-game”, i.e. I don’t think they’re referring to specific in-game items being used. It would be incredibly taxing on internal controls to record when a particular sword has been used, or a potion has been consumed. It’s more likely that that the former statement is just accounting lingo for recognizing revenue on a monthly/periodic basis as opposed to recognizing it on a cash basis.

You should use a combination of models that quantify the cash your company will generate and look at values of similar companies in the market. When you buying or selling stock, you're in a similar the position.

""You have to be able to think independently, and when you come to a conclusion you have to really not care what other people say. Just follow the facts and your reasoning."" - Warren Buffett, on what makes him different from other investors

Buffett attributes his success to having *confidence* in his facts and reasoning. When I understand how a business makes money, make reasonable assumptions about it's future, and use valuation models to tie it all together, it gives me a lot of confidence. When things don't go my way but I still feel confident my analysis is correct, I don't panic. Unfortunately the valuation process is full of friction. We felt we could build technology to ease many of these frictions for ourselves and others so we started finbox.io.

A telecom/subscription business you build around ARPU/sub growth/Churn/Customer acquisition cost and run sensitivities around those. If you are looking at a enterprise sales models, you build around big client chunks and implied probabilities around their pipelines. If you are looking at early stage venture you build around future expected market position and economics and discount it backwards.

",3,1461356839,[],,,
t3_4fldva,d2a2tgc,"Instead of following what online videos advise you when creating a model, you should understand the theory behind each number.
This is a more productive use of your time. 

For example, you are mistaking margin for growth. This is readily apparent in your EBIT and EBITDA margins. From the perspective of someone reading your model, they would dismiss it immediately because you are predicting that EBIT margins are higher than EBITDA margins over the long-term. This implies negative DA and capital expenditure spending cannot be negative over any prolonged period if the company is expected to grow as per your model. 

I didn't go through your model cell-by-cell as its pointless to point out mistakes by excel. Spreadsheets don't make mistakes, its the creator of it which make them.

Some other tips I would like to leave you with is that prepaid assets and accrued expenses are typically a percentage of revenue. It is done this way because as a company grows, it has to prepay more expenses and hire more employees (accrued expenses) to sustain its operations. Furthermore, A/R, A/P, and Inventory numbers are derived from something called the cash conversion cycle. This helps tie in your model and helps you understand how quickly the company can receive the cash its owed. Take for example a manufacturer, if they want to sell a widget at Wal-Mart, they would typically have to give Wal-Mart a lenient payment term. However, depending on how good the manufacture is at negotiating with its suppliers, it can also demand lenient terms from them as well. The cash conversion cycle helps you understand how long cash is tied up in inventory, when it receives the money it's owed from its suppliers, and when does it receive its money from Wal-Mart. 

... I'd also encourage you to spend less time trying to figure out how to build models if your goal is to become a securities analyst.

3) Develop 2 valuations:

The first valuation is the private company's value as a standalone entity. This exludes all synergies and utilizes the private company's own WACC.

The second valuation is the private company's value with cost + revenue synergies built into the model. Utilize Dycom Industries' WACC for this valuation. This will show you the optimal value of the private company.

Now, the delta between the 2 valuations (Optimal Value - Standalone Value) will give you the level of value created through the acquisition. This figure is good to know and will help you understand what your maximum premium should be for acquiring the business.

t3_4lg4kp,d3n6b54,"I think Buffet both reads about industries he doesn't invest in and he doesn't *literally* mean he doesn't understand industries. I'm sure he has a faint understanding of nearly every type of business at this point (or could at least figure it out quickly). 

Buffett almost certainly means, he doesn't invest in businesses that he can't understand how to accurately project their financials 5 years out (to pick an arbitrary intermediate-term time period). That is what he means when he avoids tech companies (he uses computers and is best friends with Gates; I'm sure he can figure out the supply/demand characteristics). The issue is, it's hard to figure out the plateau-demand for fast-growing companies, tech companies face direct or subsitute competition that can be difficult to define or monitor prior to the competition over taking their business. Basically, Buffett thinks there are unknown risks with tech companies that precludes him from investing because he runs an insurance company that should be conservative (he already puts 3x+ greater % of his float in equity investments compared to his riskiest peers).

When Buffett says ""invest in what you know"", I like to think of it as a very general rule.
1. Understand how the business makes money and both the direct and indirect (e.g. substitute) competition.
2. The cash flows for the business should be relatively predictable (obviously no future equity cash flows are 100% predictable, BUT there's a big difference between Proctor & Gamble and Twitter). This has a lot to do with his source of capital, insurance premiums. For you, the individual investor, you may not be so risk-averse (or put differently, you *can* lose money, given the right risk/reward opportunity). However, I think Buffett recommends the golden rule **#1 Don't lose money** because most investors (individual and institutional) don't realize how costly a severe loss to principal is to long-term returns. See example #1 below.

That's a long-winded way of saying that I think Buffett's writing/quotes are extremely useful, but you need to decipher them from his POV and apply them to your situation. They are definitely open to a wide-range of interpretations.

As to the reading, I would think it is very likely that he reads NFLX's 10-k and similar, disruptive companies/industries. If you want to invest ""for blood"" (obtain 5%-15% alpha), I think you almost certainly need a world view. I see Buffett's investing history as indicative that he has both a world view and he seeks out certain businesses/industries as opposed to researching the cheapest security laid in front of him. I think he actively searches for cheap opportunities in numerous, specific spots. It's another method of risk management. If you know of spots where perceived risk > actual risk (obviously in your *hopefully informed* view).

Try to breakdown your interest in HAL and I bet you'll see that the above is actually fairly intuitive reaction. However, we dilute our ability to do this by investing in dozens of other opportunities where we did not have such ""insights"".  For HAL, I'm sure you noticed 1) low oil prices, 2) prolonged low oil prices, 3) continuously declining oil rigs, 4) widely-held pessimistic view on future oil prices, 5) recent decline in HAL's stock price, and 6) HAL has a market-leading position in their industry.

So you identified an opportunity/spot where you believe perceived risk > what actual risk will ultimately be; widely-held pessimistic views of certain factors, which happen to be what drives performance for HAL; HAL is the market share leader, so they have relatively predictable cash flows; and HAL has been oversold.

I don't know anything about the energy industries but maybe HAL will work out. Either way, I think WEB would support further research into the idea. WEB has performed so well because he identified the process that led to great ideas, honed it to become more efficient, and remained discipline to only purchase when he truly followed it.

t3_4mvdhm,d3zkyxb,"Ah ok see this is much better thinking, but I have identified some possible errors in your thoughts that you may want to consider. 

The first is that diversity may or may not be good. I haven't looked at the financials yet (I might just because I like companies like this), but you should look at how management segments the company. Good reports will segment out operating income and assets for each business unit, and in this case the FedEx business likely makes up a large part of that. Use these statements to see what businesses the company is in and how attractive they are. If the company is diversified into low margin, high capital businesses that generate measly ROIC, then that's bad diversification. If they are diversified into attractive growing moats, then that is good diversification. If the new CEO is a former hedge fund manager, I would hope he/she would set up systems to capital budget effectively to maximize shareholder value. 

The second possible error is your suggestion that any growth is good growth. This is understandably a common error. The truth is, if a company is growing but the incremental ROIC is lower than its cost of capital, it is destroying shareholder value. If it's ROIC is equal to cost of capital, no value is created either (rather the firm just gets bigger). What you want to see is incremental, high ROIC growth in excess of the cost of capital. This is true value creation, and this is, when compounded, is what makes a ten-bagger. However, there are many opportunities to create value for shareholders even if ROIC < WACC. This is value creation by shrinking (opposite of growth). If this company had poor ROIC prospects, the math actually makes sense to sell of underperforming assets and return value to shareholders. Someone like a hedge fund manager ceo or a dominant presence like Biglari can push for things like that. 

I hope you don't read this as me shitting on your ideas, it's quite the contrary. If you have $15 I highly recommend reading Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and beyond.

The main reason is the financial data is costly.

They are also saying that they see their future as part of the mainstream banking system and so several have applied for federal banking licenses or say they are willing to work with banks. These 2 changes will require existential changes in the business models. Fintechs are transforming from run and gun venture backed disrupters, to boring regulated normal looking banks.

The other reality that is oft neglected is that the CEO wasn't involved in the investment vehicle in order to line his pockets but in order to generate some origination and keep the company afloat. That is a far more troubling scenario. Additionally, people citing strong governance because of the swift removal of Laplanche are delusional.

The theory that Laplanche is going to lead a take private LBO is far fetched. He was fired but on paper he resigned.

t3_4rnvcp,d52rnb7,"Good question!

It all comes down to control. Let's say you're valuing a private business and you estimate the future cash flows are worth $1 million, but you're buying the business with $100k of excess cash (cash you can strip out from day one as the business doesn't need it for working capital, and the previous owners kindly leave it in there), then you'd probably pay $1.1 million for it as you could go pocket the $100k cash on day one.

The complication with listed equities is you don't have this direct control. Let's say you have the same situation but you're looking at a company where future cash flows are worth $1 billion, and they've got $100 million in cash. Do you increase the value by $100 million? It really depends on your view on what happens to that cash. To me the sensible options are:

1) Assume it sits there idly for a few years and it's worth some discounted value of that future amount.

2) Assume it sits there idly for a few years but it's fairly risk-free so discount that future amount by a lower amount.

3) Assume management takes that cash and does something useful (that earns a high return) with it that isn't factored into your future cash flows already (meaning it's worth more than $100m)

4) Assume management blows it on something in which case it's worth less than $100m.

I tend to take approach #1 where I provide some value to cash/investments but discount it. I don't value it at 100% of its value as I'd rather have the cash in my pocket, but since this isn't the same as having cash in your pocket, it's worth less.

The cash in the firm belongs to the shareholders. But if you need that cash for operations or to execute your M&A strategy then it might not be excess cash. Only the excess cash should be considered in your net - debt calculation.

When you are valuing a firm as an M&A target you are interested in buying the equity in the firm. If you buy all the equity, then you become the shareholders and all the cash on the balance sheet belongs to you. So if the marlet value of equity is worth 1.5B and there's 1B in debt and .5b cash sitting there.

From their Q4 Press Release: ""Operating profit in fiscal year 2015 was RMB11.672 billion ($1.802 billion), an 8.8% decrease from 2014. Transaction Services reduced non-GAAP operating margins by 25.1 percentage points and iQiyi further reduced non-GAAP operating margins by 5.5 percentage points for the fiscal year 2015.""

So my guess would be most people that own the stock right now believe that your ~20% adjusted EBIT margin is far too low of a starting point given that they say Transaction Services and iQiyi reduced their margin to ~17.5% from ~48% (11.6B in EBIT into 66.4B in revenue plus the 25.1%+5.5% stated above).  

Obviously when your doing real work you shouldn't take management at face value, but just to demonstrate the logic I'm implying, take the same EBIT multiple you imply with your DCF of 13.45 (your value of operating assets of 192.9B / 14.3B EBIT).  Then multiply that times an adjusted EBIT of 31.9B (48% margin x 66.382B revenue).  If I plug that into your value of operating assets and leave all your adjustments I end up with something like US$196 per share.

I'm not saying the above math is right, but the questions you should be worrying about are will these losses continue forever? Should I be valuing the core search business on its own?  Are the money losing businesses worth more than zero?  Ask questions that you would want to know if you were a business person owning the business.

1) Might be anecdotal, but I find that the funds with the best returns really do have an intense focus on a specific discipline of value investing. Whether that be finding net-nets, special situations, compounders or even certain geographies and markets. It's certainly not a disadvantage to be a generalist, but I do think it's an advantage to be specific to a certain strategy. See Curreen capital (spinoffs), Riskowitz capital (south african compounder focus, some 35%+ returns) and Denali capital (Malone feitsh dude, spinoffs and special situations)

2) well the whole premise of a DCF is assumptions on ""variables"" - assuming revenue growth, margin expansion/contraction etc etc. Obviously a lot can change in 5-10 years and you're essentially trying to forecast the future, as such, DCF's are really just assumptions based on changing variables and then discounting fcf to PV.

3) Just some thoughts here - why not use goodwill as well in ""reproduction costs""? That's certainly a factor as well as SG&A and R&D when trying to replicate a company. I'd also put weight on the cost of assets, especially if it's a capex heavy industry - what's the cost basis of a factory on the b.s etc.

5) I think you would be right regarding your logic for maintenance capex. But I believe that quote is referring to growth capex. Some industries, i.e low moat industries, think airlines - say one airline is experiencing high levels of passenger growth (winning market share), this has to be followed up with large growth capex in aircraft (the reinvestment in the business). I mean, its not really being given back to shareholders, right? Especially given the average airlines destroy invested capital.

**There is only one time when a stock buyback makes sense:** when the traded stock is trading significantly below intrinsic value. In other words, undervalued.

So why then do so many companies employ buy-back programs that seem never ending? Clearly not all of them are undervalued all the time?

As I see it, the problem with buybacks are twofold:

1) Business managers are unlikely to think their businesses are overvalued / don't want to signal that their stock is expensive.


2) As /u/BigR0n75 has laid out, there are short term cognitive biases related to share buybacks. Namely, when you buy back stock, a) your share price goes up in the near term (an additional buyer in the market, fewer shares outstanding), and b) per share metrics like EPS improve as the number of shares outstanding declines. Some investors just multiply a P/E vs. EPS, so there is a bit of a psychological gamesmanship here.


**But here's the part that many miss**: although EPS goes up in the buyback scenario, the intrinsic value of the business doesn't increase if you are using shareholder equity (cash on the balance sheet) to buy shares that are overvalued. In that case the NPV of that business declines. 

The analogy here is, when you buy-back overvalued stock, investors get a bigger slice of the total pie, but the whole pie shrinks even more.

Often large institutional investors push management teams to buy-back stock, because it can provide a boost in their investment returns in the near term, but this isn't sound advice.

Global growth seems slow right now, and in most cases, I don't have a problem when my investments conduct buyback programs when reinvestment alternatives appear to carry outsize risk.  The tax savings derived from buybacks vs. dividends can be significant, and can even justify buying back shares at a slight overvaluation to intrinsic value.

t3_5f96vu,daj4ukk,"Interesting topic!

I look at share buybacks as one of the capital allocation decisions available to management teams. I see 3 primary ways to deploy extra capital (capital in excess of maintaining current business):

- Share buybacks
- Dividends
- Investment in company growth

I believe prudent management teams have an idea of the intrinsic value of their company's shares (although we can say that management teams are probably more optimistic than the outside investor). At any rate, having an idea of what a share is worth would allow the management team to compare investment opportunities. 

For example, let's say we have a publicly traded auto dealership company with 100 dealerships that generate $100M in annual earnings and the enterprise value of the company is at $1B. Next year, they have the opportunity to buy a new dealership that generates $1M in annual earnings for $15M. It may be a better deal to repurchase shares as you are buying $1M of earnings for $10M through buybacks instead of $15M for the new dealership. If both opportunities don't look compelling, management can pay out dividends or hold on to the cash. Obviously a simplified example, but I hope that explains my thought with some degree of clarity. The essence of it is about how much $$ we're paying for a dollar in annual earnings.

Personally, I find it interesting that many investors seem to want cash in action. Sometimes having a stockpile of cash on the balance sheet can provide value in terms of available liquidity (vs. generating returns).

This level of capital reserve was deemed prudent given the rarity of that incident, and carried forward to the entire country. Thus the NIM business was deemed safe to hold 2.5% of book as buffer.

The guaranty business, was also studied by Volcker and a buffer of 50bps deemed sufficient to cover 99th percentile loss cases and loss severity AND the opportunity cost of keeping capital on standby; given underwriting standards in the day (1990) (ie. LTV 75% max).

Further an over-capitalization of 30% over and above the above two considerations was assumed prudent.

I took this as my guide, extrapolating to the present balance sheet and came up with a capital buffer of $20Bn.  I don't think we have the data to dig further into their business and do a risk-based asset weighting because that would be just too much data which is not in the 10k filings.

t3_5liav4,dbvxf3v,"It's a matter of preference and situation, both strategies have their advantages. You can make money off long and short holding periods.

If you find a great company like Google/Apple/Amazon early on when they're small you're gonna get huge returns, but eventually their growth potential is gonna slow down so if you hold them forever you're limiting your returns. And in that case it might be better to search for undervalued, or even crappy companies, to make money faster cause you have to think about time too. Who knows though, a company like Google may never stop growing at a fast rate.

You'll notice at Berkshire Buffet hired Todd Combs, whose holding period is less than a year in some cases, to take over for him so Buffet believes in other strategies. But Combs in only managing like $9 billion, when you're managing $120 billion like Buffet there's only so much money you can allocate and you're forced to staying with slower growth large companies. Imagine trying to invest in small caps when your AUM is a few billion, not really an efficient use of your money or time. So it depends on how much money you have.

And maybe you don't wanna spend all your time looking for undervalued situations cause you'll have to read so many filings every week. I don't know about you but while investing is interesting, it's not exactly fun. It's kinda ridiculous people push that aspect, like when that NYU professor Aswath Damodaran made a blog post/video trying to make a case for active management literally saying he invests his own money because it's fun even though he's probably not going to beat an index fund.

Competitors, Anti-Trust laws, bad board members or just something as simple as the company falling out of the publics favor (hot coffee, old chicken.. which conversely may provide an attractive entry point) will prevent endless growth.

I say that to say... use your discretion. If you value a security at $1.00 and it's selling at $.60, you take a position, then rational tells you that once it has arrived at the price point that correlates with proper intrinsic value, then you have accomplished what you intended to do... It's up the the individual investor if he/she would like to maintain their postion... or sell off and find another dollar for 2 quarters. I listened to a podcast recently (don't ask me about the exact investor) that explained how a 70/30 split between value and growth has historically outperformed not only the market, but portfolios who strictly followed a value philosophy.... I will look into this further, my curiosity always gets the best me with matters such as this, but... Personally that goes against a mantra I've attempted to follow in any and all of my past business endeavors, which is 'Always take the for sure money, as long as you deem the value to be fair'. The counter to this is either a) you're selling off too low, b) you run the risk of losing established value or c) you sell off above value. 2 out of the 3 of those outcomes are obviously unattractive, and the only beneficial one relies far too much on luck, or Grahams favorite investing opposition: speculators wearing the mask of investors... Will I personally change? Maybe. But as of now, none are outcomes I'm willing to gamble for.

Conversely, quantifying intangibles, and applying them to your valuation, will obviously effect your decision, as it should. I've considered myself a student of Graham for roughly 6 months, my prior investing knowledge was limited to small interactions with my own 401k... So I will continue to learn and apply.

My end point still remains as I initially explained... It's up to you whether you want to sell or not. Just be sure you're not letting your emotions drive your decisions... Check out Mungers talk at Harvard back in the mid 90's, he goes in depth to explain the psychological biases we all encounter...

Trina Solar Limited is a mid-size player in the Solar panel industry (871 USDm market cap). This is a Chinese company listed in the US under the ADS program (American Depositary Share). 
Basically management and a consortium of private equity firms are taking the firm private as the market gives them a pretty low valuation (or at least that's what they think). 
The buyer group offered $11.60 per ADS ($11.53 post ADS cancellation fee) and the stock closed today at $9.83. Transaction approved by shareholders at ~97% in December 2016. So you're looking at a spread of 18% for an expected close of late Q1 2017. Financing is pretty much figured out, the Industrial Bank of China is providing one of the PE firms (Panji) with an ~650 USDm RMB equivalent credit facility.  

My view as to why is the spread so large: (1) US based investors do now want to invest in Chinese companies (lack of trust and some examples where transparency was an issue, just not here), and (2) there is uncertainty as to whether the deal will be let through by the Chinese regulators (they did halt a similar deal in 2016, however only retarded the transaction, Chinese authorities did not forbid the deal). Even assuming some latency with regards to the close date, you're still looking at a pretty amazing annualized return.

t3_5oicql,dcjn8xb,"Personally, I don't play with anything that requires me to be too accurate. My goal is to be less wrong than the prediction in the price. That's enough to make some decent returns on some of these growth stocks.

For example, if the price is predicting -3% growth, their past book value or earnings growth has been 15-25%, and I am confident for one reason or another that -3% growth is highly unlikely, I can pick up the stock at -3% and anything beyond that is free. For me it all depends on what you're dealing with and what numbers you are comfortable using.

Of course leverage is another factor to consider, but most of these growth stocks I'm looking at either have 0 debt or positive net cash. And as a side note, it's amazing how many companies are priced rationally in the $500mm-4bn price range. You see earnings or book value growth in the past to be 10-15%, and you see the price forecasting future growth of 10-15%. But then you add back in net cash or some other factor a little under the surface, and the price now projects -10% growth. Read the 10k and management doesn't talk about ""future challenges"" or slowdowns. The market just didn't consider cash in the register! That's a great way to buy growth for free.

What makes a growth stock attractive is an affordable price. Buying a growth stock at a fair price could go either way, up or down.

Or imagine if a company had a habit of retiring assets every 5 years. These should not be ""one time charges"" or whatever they call them. These are routine expenditures.) So I think starting at FCF and making adjustments works best for me in most cases. FCFF or EBIT might be another starting point if you're analyzing the company's ability to make debt payments. I think the key here is to know the differences between the metrics so that we use them appropriately.

It would help to be able to make the distinction between maintenance capex & R&D and investments for future growth because maintenance is simply a cost of doing business and cuts into cash flow indefinitely, but identifying excess investments for growth signifies a shot at even greater earnings.

All this mumbo jumbo about EBITDA and EBIT is crazy. They have very useful purposes when used in context, but everything is flipped over when they're used by management to justify bonuses or exuberant acquisitions. I think Buffett said enough about them in his letters.

Getting the working capital figure for discontinued operations looks tricky because, even though you can easily get the liquidation or acquisition price of the discontinued operation, it's not as easy to identify what current liabilities were associated with the operation... And they might carry these short term liabilities for a while longer than the life of the operation if the terms are favorable.

I'm not sure what you mean by, ""When modeling a company with discontinued operations, should you exclude the applicable amounts from prior periods?"" Amounts? You mean the cash?

The $192.8 is all classified under ""Other long-term liabilities,"" and the remainder $4.2 is under ""Other accrued liabilities"" (a current liability), maybe part of $129.5 in short-term employee benefits..

t3_5zjx0m,df2zg3z,"Thanks for sharing. I love when people share these sorts of ideas and we can discuss them here.

I just wanted to comment on a couple things. 

Firstly, you mentioned ""The most relevant investment risks for Eagle Bulk Shipping,"" 1, 2, 3, and 4. Compare this to Marty Whitman's advice ""On Market Comebacks. (100 Baggers p156-157)"" regarding companies unlikely to participate in a recovery.

    1. Stocks that were grossly overpriced to begin with.
    2. Stocks that suffer a permanent impairment.
    3. Stocks subject to massive dilution during the meltdown
       where old common stockholders were unable to protect themselves from dilution.

So this sucker was $320/share back in 2014; we can't expect to ever see it there again in the reasonable future. Now are the economics of the business impaired? If so, how long is it likely to be that way? Will the company be able to survive a prolonged slow down without diluting shareholders or defaulting on debt?

Honestly, what type of upside are we even looking at here in a best case scenario? You told us our downside was 1-41%. I like the saying, ~""If you can't convince a toddler by drawing your thesis with crayons, it's probably a worthy skip.""

I liked about 90% of the article, but about 10% kind of irked me. Please consider these comments as constructive criticism with the intention on making your content even better going forward.

1. Your reference to ""Berkshire Hathaway AI Biotech Cloud Data Inc."" and further paragraph on comparing Berkshire Hathaway to tech companies really loses credibility. Had it been higher up in your article, I would have stopped reading. I know from your following paragraphs that you understand that tech valuations are high compared to the slow and steady businesses that Berkshire Hathaway is in. I just found that the comparison to tech added no value. Furthermore, whenever I see other people compare valuations across industries, it shows to me that they don't understand investing. I'm not saying that you are doing that here. I'm just trying to say that you've done yourself a disservice by comparing to tech.

2. Your second table shows pretax earnings for wholy owned subsidiaries, which provided an excellent and easily understood overview. It would be much better if you showed historical data too (let's say 5 years), along with a CAGR % over that 5 year period. This would reinforce your sentence in the following paragraph about 20% annualized growth rate since 1999. My reasoning for this is that we've had a very healthy past few years. Was 2016 just very good for Berkshire Hathaway, and possibly a one-off? I don't know from the data you've showed. 

3. Minor comment - Generally speaking, I was fine with the way you just assumed a 10x PE ratio for the operating businesses, but I think it would be a much more persuasive argument if you had taken the median/average industry multiple from a reliable 3rd party source, multiply that by the operating unit, and then come up with an undiscounted valuation of Berkshire as a whole (I dont know if you have sufficient detail in the financials to do this or not). This would allow me as the reader to make my own determination as to whether there was a sufficient margin of safety in the share price for me to warrant a purchase.

I own Kingstone, and have for the last two years.  The stock is up 90% and has obviously been a great investment.  Unfortunately for me, it is a tiny position.

You are analyzing an insurance company, so I think the first thing you really want to do is to understand and focus on the metrics that experienced investors in the insurance industry focus on.  For the insurance industry, that is mainly the claims ratio, expense ratio, combined ratio, ROE and the company's stock price/book value ratio.

You very briefly touched on the fact that Kingstone has a very high underwriting margin, and that the average insurance company's underwriting margin is barely positive (most refer an insurance company's combined ratio rather than underwriting margin).  This is, IMO, the critical area that you should examine in much greater detail.  Kingstone is mainly writing homeowners policies.  It is extremely unusual for an insurance company writing standard homeowners policies to be so profitable.  Personally, I have never figured out how they have been able to be so profitable, which explains why the position size for me is tiny.

Other things I would want to know are how aggressively or conservatively the investment portfolio is invested, the company's history in terms of reserving for future claims, the extent to which the company is at risk in the event of a catastrophe event (such as a hurricane) and since Kingstone is expanding into new geographical areas, whether they can have similar success in these new areas.",3,1492890723,[],,,

**I do not believe technology companies with strong leadership, vision, and a history of success in new high growth markets are overvalued.** 

This is where I think a lot of traditional value investors fall short. The way companies should operate in the 21st has fundamentally changed as a result of an increasing rate of technological growth (software is eating the world, as they say) and that companies that capitalize on this **consistently** (which often, to grossly simplify, requires focusing on growth and cash flow over profit) will generally outperform companies that focus on profitability and high margins in the long run. 

Amazon to me is the poster child of the problem current value investors face. Value investors continuously bash Amazon for not having any profits despite the fact that they're a cash flow and CCC monster relative to their peers, have an exceptional growth rate for a company of their size, and have consistently performed well in new areas well outside their original market (e.g. AWS). They've also managed to create a significant moat that I believe couldn't exist without their high growth strategy. I have no doubt that Amazon is worth more than its current value.

R was developed by statisticians for statisticians. It is like Isaiah Berlin's hedgehog in that it does one thing very, very well: data analytics. There are over 7,000 packages, many of then specifically geared towards finance and stock market analysis. There are tons of academic-like books -- e.g., the Springer series -- about R.

Python was developed by a computer science kind of guy. It is like Isaiah Berlin's fox in that it can support many things: web development, network management, gaming, some data analytics, and so on.

From a data analytics point of view, I personally don't think Python has quite the infrastructure that R has. There are a few luminaries, like Andrew Gelman, and there are a few aspects of data analytics at which Python really eats R's lunch. But if you are looking for answers about data analytics questions in forums or other venues, you have to wade through a lot of other stuff to find the vein. At least that's been my experience.

So yeah, you are right that Python is probably more flexible for non-statistical stuff. On the other hand, in my view Python doesn't match the depth or breadth of R's power when it comes to statistical stuff.

So again, it depends on what you're looking for.

One of the things about Python that I found frustrating was the 2.x vs 3.x issue. In my view Guido van Rossum made a huge mistake by not drawing a firmer line in the sand and sticking to it.

Shareholders equity represents the initial investment made by owners of the company PLUS any retained profits not paid out to shareholders.  Therefore, businesses that have chosen to repay their shareholders initial investment plus all profits every year, will have no shareholders equity.
The reason why a debt investor would want equity is because the debt is being used to finance growth.  In the absence of growth, no debt would be required.  
For HD, they continue to return capital to investors and maintain a certain capital structure (leverage) based on a multiple of EBITDA.  Therefore, every time EBITDA rises, the company adds additional debt and repurchases stock.
Zimmer, your comment is not accurate.  Shareholders equity always tells your something about a company.  In this case, the treasury stock is a great indication of value.

t3_6e5ss6,di94mre,"

A lot of the pricing pressure on branded generics post-Valeant is simply due to higher regulatory scrutiny. There was a lot of inefficiency in the distribution channel prior to Valeant/Shkreli. 

Firstly, branded generics like any other branded product invoke trust. When you’re putting pills with funny names in your body, you’d rather not take chances with potential knock-offs. The constant fearmongering campaigns by ‘reputable studies’ didn’t help. Secondly, big pharma would send coupons directly to your door and urge you to directly ask your pharmacy for them, thus bypassing the doctor’s recommendation. Thirdly, doctors and pharmacy employees themselves would be incentivized to recommend your brand over a bioequivalent non-brand generic. 

It also had to do with the relationship between B2B participants. Part of the reason why doctors would recommend your brand over a cheaper, equally effective generic was because they knew that your insurance provider would be picking up the tab, not you. Pharma reps would strong-arm insurance reps into accepting their terms (or else), and regulators had been turning a blind eye to the status quo for decades (guess why) so there was no reason to expect change. Specialty pharmacies like Express Script played up the need for bespoke access to unique drug delivery methods to keep patients reliant on their supply chain. 

Then there was also the whole tax inversion thing. Post-Pfizer that avenue was cut off. The roll-up trend over the past decade was basically deliberate industry consolidation on an institutional scale. 

However, now that regulatory and political momentum is on the other foot, insurers are starting to demand ‘justice’ and lower prices ‘for the people’. Obamacare was actually partially designed to increase transparency simply so that people would recognize on their own how obscene prices were compared to other developed countries. I’d say they achieved that objective.   

Basically, the post-Valeant branded generic sector is undergoing a disruption similar to how the Internet decimated the moat of cable companies. The bargaining power of the distribution channel is being whittled away in favour of better transparency between the source and the end-consumer. When that margin opportunity disappears, prices are bound to be attacked by competition. 

There’s a good reason why Bezos is targeting the branded generic pharma space. There’s just so much inefficiency in the system that e-commerce enabled price transparency and the crowdsourced online review system can replace and improve on. The branded generic sector is the poster boy for his favourite saying, “your margin is my opportunity”.

- Brief overview of the sector and the landscape. If you will talk about a global opportunity for the company, just touch it there. But again, keep it brief.

- Segments the company operates in - headcount, geography, assets (don't got into revenue yet)

- Why is Vianet worth your attention? - This used to be my standard headline because it made me think as i created the slide as well. I would highlight not more than 4 points - one about the quality of cash flow, one about the assets, one for industry and one for management and their capital allocation ability. Write less and explain more. That will give the impression that you have earned your spot.
- Why is it so cheap? - lack of analysts coverage / liquidity / size / recent troubles etc..
- Brief history of the company. remember the chronology - you may find it a bit weird to have history so late in the presentation but it is like taking your listeners on a journey. start with a question and take them to the answer.
- Quality - if it is a value stock - focus on assets and replacement value. if it is a growth play - focus on their competitive advantage
 - Segments - now go back to the segments and list why you think any one of these or all of these have potential.Charts. regardless of how smart people are, as humans we retain pictographic info better. use charts for revenue, margins, FCF whatever.
- Resilience - if you find anything that shows how resilient the business has been, it is an advantage.
- Management - Explain why you think they are better than the others and the best ones to do the job. use their background to help you but if they have bought back stock when it was cheap or have quoted about a disciplined buyback, i would use it.
 - on the same note, shrewd acquisitions also show why the management is good.
- Balance Sheet : Can't stress its importance enough. 
- Valuation: Regardless of whether you use a multiple based valuation or DCF, be very clear on your assumptions. And to be safe always go with a range, if you think they can do 14% margin, have an estimate for 16%(bull case) and 12% (bear case). 
- Your valuation is only as good as your assumptions. Be reasonable and practical. 
- For a computer grad, if you explain all this and say that you can and will learn valuation, i don't know why they won't give you a shot.

Warren is not doing DCF valuations, he's doing EPV valuations which use historical data to normalize cashflows to get the best sense of what a typical year is today moving forward. These can be done quickly, sometimes in your head. 

DCF relies on predicting growth and wacc into the future. It requires a bit of a crystal ball to be accurate, but in the end you should be able to solve for the current stock price (or the stock price the day after earnings came out). 
The thing is, you don't know if the rate of terminal growth is going to be 1% or 3%, so you've got to play the field because they could all be possible. Similarly, you don't know if wacc will be 5% or 9% in the future, so you have to make a lot of assumptions.  Warren buffet would say that since you're making so many assumptions with DCF that it loses its value. I would argue that it's important to know  how to value a firm the way the street does it before you step away to the value investing side.

To respond to your questions: Yes of course, if you can invest in a de facto monopoly business at a reasonable price that offers essentially certain future cash flows that would be a great methodology for investing. Hahaha. But it is not exactly ""simple and profitable"". The first problem is **""reasonable price""** and finding these opportunities. Many newbies to investing read Ben Graham and then they go try to apply the ideas they just read in The Intelligent Investor book to today's market for real and get a rude awakening; markets have changed, pricing has changed, things are expensive (Buffett has complained of this too and he has the added problem of dealing with a your mama sized book and there is even less available once you play with big money). There are opportunities, just fewer and not as ignored/underpriced as in the old days. 

The second problem is the classic **""horse carriages and cars problem""**, imagine a hundred years ago you dug through financials and discovered an awesome horse carriage manufacturer with a de facto monopoly, a solid moat and cash that flowed forth as consistently as Janet Yellen's ums and ahs. Well that might have all the hallmarks of a great investment if you didn't factor in cars were being invented and about to take over. You still have to predict the future and that is hard! TL;DR thinking of moats and monopolies and PV of CFs is still one of the best ways to invest but it is not as so simple or profitable as one might think, especially when you factor in time and opportunity cost to find these things and for your thesis to play out and the other places your money could be.

On the face of it, this would be nice, right? To know there are companies whose moats are unassailable for the duration of your time horizon who will offer ever-rewarding returns?

However, as we know, things are not so cut and dry in real life. Replace ""monopoly"" with ""differentiation"" and his statements are not as dramatic in the marketing sense. A few things immediately come to mind...

1. In my view, mispricings originate mostly from uncertainty about the future. Market pricing aside, the very nature of accrual accounting even bears this out. And even if we assume company A has an iron-clad monopoly in a certain product/service, is it prohibited then from chasing down a future opportunity? Missteps there could erode value.

2. Tons of smart, motivated people will likely eventually win out over the handful of innovators who reside within a monopoly's employment. To combat this, the outside innovation must be noticed at an early stage in the hopes of buying out the soon-to-be rival competition. 

3. There will likely be widespread market upheavals at some point in the future, leaving no one a ""guarantee"" of safety, monopoly or not.

4. To build on point 1, even if there's a relative sense of certainty, relying on the market's judgment supposes its judgment to be accurate. In my experience, however, this is not always the case. The market is driven, not solely by callous numbers and figures, but by people. People who have wants and needs, emotions, and ""life events"" that weigh heavily on their decisions.",2,1499964632,[],,,

t3_6oqmkt,dkjlq4d,"As to your first question, this is a crucial piece to understand the fundamentals of investing. Let's use an example to help explain. Let's just say you buy a $100 bond with a 10% yield that lasts forever. You will get a 10 dollar payment every year. As long as interest rates remain the same, it has a value of $100, because you could buy an identical bond with a different $100. What happens however if interest rates fall to 5%. You could take that same $100 and buy a bond, but instead of the $10 you would receive every year, you only get $5. To receive an income of $10 you would have to buy $200 worth of bonds. The bond you originally bought for $100 yielding $10 is now worth more than when you started, because your bond yields twice as much as a bond bought at the current interest rate. Similarly, if interest rates doubled and went to 20% your bond price would fall. You would only yield $10 whereas a new $100 invested would yield $20. Hope this helps explain.",7,1500677296,[],,,
t3_6oqmkt,dkjfkab,"1. He's probably referring to publicly traded bonds here (the money was already issued). A bond at 100 with a 5% coupon falls to 50 would have a current yield of 10%. The yield to maturity is a different calculation and would not be that 10%. That's typically what people mean by yield. But as bond prices fall, the yield you receive is higher. 

2. That depends on your own investment objectives/risk tolerance. The yields are low, so T-bills don't provide a good return. 

3. Say you loan money to a company at a 15% rate because it's a really risky company. You'd pay above par (100) for a handful of reasons: The interest rates fall, making this yield more valuable (pushing prices up). 2. The company's credit improves (the business performs well, etc.) and the risk of the company falls. 

4. You can't hold it past the maturity date (unless the company goes into bankruptcy). The company would pay you back your money at maturity.

I hope this helps. I found bonds really confusing when I started out, and mostly skimmed them in II at the time.",2,1500670111,[],,,
t3_6oqmkt,dkjl5yo,"1.  This one was confusing to me for the longest time.  So take a simple bond with a fixed coupon payment-say it's a 6% coupon on a $1000 bond and let's also assume the current risk free rate is 5%.  
That coupon is fixed and never changes, you will get paid $60 per year (6% of $1000).  Your return is 6% and that is locked in for you because you paid par for the bond.  Now if the risk free rate moves from 5% to 6% then no one will buy your bond from you at a 6% return.  People will demand a 7% return for your bond, which means you'll have to lower the price.  When you lower the price on the bond, they collect the $60 per year, they will get a higher return on the bond because they paid less for it.  So price went down and yield went up.  Works the other way too, if you raise the price when you sell it and someone pays more for it, the $60 per year is a lower yield for them.

2.  This is really risk dependent and depends on your investment objectives.  It is for some people and not for others.  Just because yields are low it doesn't mean they can't go even lower, which mean bonds would be worth more if you owned them.  So you could make money that way.  Conversely, if yields go higher again you would lose money and would be better off investing in something else.  It depends what you think will happen from here and what your risk tolerance will be.

3.  One example for when a bond could trade at a premium is when a company outperforms.  Say there is some really risky and small company called ""Fiber Optics Inc"".  They issue 30 year bonds at par and these bonds have an 8% yield.  Well the company is really risky so people demand a really high yield.  10 years later this company is doing much better, it's grown into an industry leader, has proven technology, and really is a pretty safe bet now.  I might be willing to pay $103 for the bonds even though the yield is going to be lower than 8% now but I think that's ok because I'm getting a lower yield but for a less risky company.  I could hold the bonds to maturity at a lower yield and just clip the coupon payments or if the company keeps getting even better from here maybe someone will be willing to pay me $104 for the bonds and I make a profit that way.

4.  You can't do that.  The company will pay you back the principle amount at maturity and the bond goes away.",2,1500676590,[],,,
t3_6oqb1d,dkjmwpg,"I would start by thinking about the business model.  Bon-Ton operates department stores.  The department store model has been in decline for many, many years.  The growth of Amazon and other e-commerce companies has only accelerated the downward trend.  Unless something dramatic happens to change the fortunes of the department store model, which seems terribly unlikely to me, Bon-Ton as a business won't survive, and it is just a question of when they die.    

Bon-Ton was roughly break-even on a cash-flow basis last year, but I suspect that was only because they have been under-investing in their store base.  They may be able to continue that for awhile, but it will eventually only make things worse -- see Sears.  I don't think Bon-Ton has any assets to sell off.  Bon-Ton only owns about 25 of its stores, and even those are most likely already mortgaged to the banks.  I suspect that Bon-Ton can survive some time longer by continuing to cut cap ex, but it is just a matter of time.  A recession would finish them off.

The equity seems to me to be almost certainly worthless in the long run, but you could potentially speculate and get lucky in the short term.  As you noted, the price of the stock has spiked up several times on short term optimism.

I would bet that the bonds could well be worthless as well.  The bank credit facility of $550 million is secured and comes before the bonds.  I would guess that the bank creditors will end up owning the real estate, and that there will be little to nothing left for the bondholders.

As for owning real estate leased to a dying retailer, I would need a lot more info on the specific location.  If Bon-Ton goes bankrupt, they have the option of terminating the lease.  If they terminate, you would be an unsecured creditor.  The corporate guarantee would be worthless.  You also need a plan to redevelop the real estate once Bon-Ton goes bankrupt.  Most of the space of former department stores have been redeveloped into space for multiple smaller retailers.  The cost I have seen have run in the $90-140 a square foot to redevelop or $10-15 million for an average 100,000 square foot department store.  You should also know that there will be many other owners of similar real estate that will be looking to also redevelop their space and compete with you.  Good luck",9,1500678797,[],,,

in my opinion, this leads to better consumer bargaining power, and deflation. 

before, we had inefficiencies where consumers were presented a few options at a store, but now we have thousands of global manufacturers competing for a very savvy consumer that expects a good deal. 

this must inevitably lead to price deflation, and the eroding of profit margins wholesale throughout the american economy.

t3_6s6sdk,dlc02gz,"Wow there are some quite misleading replies on here.

First of all good question you asked, because clearly cost of equity can be a confusing topic for all of us (myself included). 

Can I ask: What are you using this for? And What is the ""traditional way"" you used to calculate it?

A good rule of thumb when it comes to these types of calculations: if some trait or factor about a company makes performing a certain financial analysis calculation difficult or impossible without a workaround then also consider how much to minimize (or remove entirely) any reliance on that calculation as part of forming your investment thesis. 

A simple example would be a company with negative earnings. Obviously you can't calculate P/E ratios when earnings are negative without a workaround, so whatever number you do come up with such a ratio consider how much or little emphasis to place on that data point when forming a thesis.

As for your situation analyzing TTD. I don't know about this company or stock specifically but it sounds like it is in the tech sector and relatively new to public markets. It is so new to market that you don't even have one year of data to use for your calculations. Such a trait (new tech IPO <=1 year in the market) would be a clear example for a company where one should reconsider if/how much to rely on traditional valuation calculations methods in forming your thesis. 

On one hand there is no single right answer when it come to CoE, but there are definitely wrong answers. In the case of new companies and especially new tech companies you can't just use beta and comps like you do with more traditional companies because the dynamics and risk factors are very different. Many reasons. One reason: young companies are more likely to need a multistage discount model in their valuation (where they grow faster in the beginning years and then the rate changes). Another reason: young public co's might likely still be making significant changes to their capital structure in the near future (what is this company's long term debt level like? any chance they are about to borrow more now that they are public?). And another very important reason: in many cases comps for young tech companies are not relevant without major adjustments, such as when a newer company is taking business away from older traditional businesses. That's not a comp. For example: are Walmart and Amazon fair comps? Are Toyota and Tesla fair comps? Maybe, maybe not. Sometimes there are not relevant comps and you have to use a different method.

Again there is no single right answer but for a new young company I would pay particular attention to the growth rate the market is pricing into the stock. There is also no dividend I'm guessing so growth rate becomes twice as important here without this to backstop the calculation.

**One version of estimating a cost of equity involves backing it out of the a stock's PEG ratio. There are simple and multistage versions of this (based on Gordon mainly). I would start with this calculation, try an internet search for something like ""cost of equity, P/E and growth ratio calculation"". You can also do searches for ""risk adjusted valuation"" and read what this involves.**

It's pretty clear why cost of equity needs a unique calculation for this type of stock: Imagine you use cost of equity discount rate of 10% or even 15% based on beta and comps when the market is using 40% as the cost of equity for this stock (such spreads happens all the time)! You will end up calculating a value that makes the stock look very cheap to you (a company dollar next year to you is worth .85 cents but to the market it is worth .71 cents). You have missed out incorporating the risk factors the market attached to this young tech company. This is the opposite of being conservative when doing valuations. The antithesis of margin of safety.

Buffett can get away with his flat transferable discount rate process because he invests in companies that fit a certain common profile (older established business models generating cash and in particular not young tech companies). But you are looking at a young tech company, where revenue could swing across a huge spread of possibilities (plus Canada tends to run a slightly higher cost of equity all else being equal - don't ask why). 

**TL;DR I would recommend caution using beta or comps to calculate cost of equity for companies with notably unique risk profiles, such as a young tech company less than 1 year public. Maybe try looking up how to calculate a cost of equity based on the market's P/E growth rate assumptions for this stock. Consider including a multistage growth model and valuation techniques that stack weight multiple risk factors. Happy to answer questions about these other techniques if you end up reading about them and something isn't clear. Hope this helps.**

1) News: any negative company specific news? Scandal, issues with management, major investors selling off or going activist, etc. Of course, market/industry news can also be a factor. 

2) Income Statement: Are revenue growth expectations low? Much lower than a year or two years ago? Is the cost structure all screwed up? Sometimes big write-offs or other unusual items can scare people off and cause a stock to be cheap. 

3) Balance Sheet: Is the balance sheet strong? Too levered up? How is working capital/cash conversion cycle? If you see poor WC management/lengthening cash cycle, that can definitely be a red flag that signals poor management or weakening company position. Anything ""weird"" on there? Be sure to check the notes in the latest 10Q and 10K for any commitments/contingencies, operating leases, or other sneaky off-balance sheet stuff.

Sometimes, among micro-caps, this has a lot to do with ownership and lack of liquidity; you have in some cases 50% of the float that just doesn't trade because it's held by insiders/long-term owners, so the prevailing market price ends up being way off base and not reflective of what people who know the company really think.

Also, what's the incentive of management to actually increase value to the firm? Right now they can just bleed the $12m through operating expenses and keep it all instead of sharing it with the other shareholders.

They have negative gross margins and have been cashflowing their receivables, got a $1.5m insurance payout, and other things to keep afloat. 

Now, I kind of like this idea but here are few things that concern me:


1) 3.3m EUR (about $3.8m) product quality lawsuit pending w/ Spanish customer


2) $5.8m of assets held for sale (their Malaysian facility) is currently under review by the Johor Port Authority. However... 
>""On July 31, 2017, the Company received a notice from the Purchaser purporting to terminate the Agreement, alleging that the Johor Port Authority is seeking to impose unacceptable conditions on the approval of the transfer of the facility to the Purchaser. The Company has responded to the Purchaser disputing the validity of the purported termination on the grounds that the Condition Period has not yet expired and the Company is continuing to seek to work with the Johor Port Authority to remove the condition objected to by the Purchaser.""


3) $5.3m of their $13.4m cash balance is trapped in China, and they say:
>""evolving China currency control regulations may limit our access to the $5.3 million of cash and $0.1 million of bank acceptance notes located in China for use outside the country""

I'm going to assume that the $5.3m of cash trapped in China can be used to extinguish some of their liabilities, specifically accounts payable and accrued liabilities (looks like this line is mostly wages and other typical stuff. ~$1m is a customer deposit from a Chinese affiliate of Zhenfa, who owns 51% of STRI.). So in other words, I dislike that this cash could end up trapped, but I think STRI should be able to use most all of it domestically within China either way. 

So just doing some quick math here: 

$13.4m Cash

-3.8m for lawsuit

-5.588m for total liabilities

=$4.016m


That's $0.208 per share. 

So if you scrutinize closely, you really only have about $1.5c of 'margin of safety'. However, that's giving them ZERO credit for AR (should be mostly collectible), inventory (ehhhhh), $8m of PP&E (they claim they'll be completing sale of much of the chinese property in Q3), and the $5.8m asset for their Malaysian factory. 

Assume you give them back their AR, NONE of their inventory, and their PP&E. No factory. Also excluding about $1.5m of other tangible assets. That's $0.76c per share. 

Now that's pretty interesting. Even if you gut this thing (inventory goes to zero, misc. other assets gone, assume they lose the law suit, assume they not only fail to close factory sale, but it evaporates overnight), you still have roughly 4x upside from today's closing price.

t3_72lq36,dnjh71o,"Well there has never been ""a lot"" of margin of safety or asymmetry in grocery. But there are times it can draw interest because grocery is *very* different than other types of retail...

You are right that wholesale can often rise faster than retail prices but in the grocery business prices tend to be a lot less sticky for a variety of reasons (one obvious reason being groceries can update their prices daily if want to and they often do). Grocery is so sensitive to inflation that inflation reporting is often reported excluding food and fuel prices (fuel being another business that can change prices quickly and react to inflation and/or wholesale prices by the day). 

People need to eat. They will buy food. So in an inflationary environment (or expected inflationary environment), some investors see grocery as a consumer facing business that, better than others at least, will be able to pass on higher prices to consumers and hug the inflation curve tighter. 

And many think this is exactly what happened recently: with QE over the last few years many investors did and still do expect inflation to come (right or wrong) and they made moves or expansions into grocery (the new moves by Lidl (grocery chain from Germany) and Sprouts are very well funded expansions, obviously AMZN thought it was worth it too). 

Though it should be said some investors see grocery as more of hedge against inflation or market correction than a huge asymmetrical upside opportunity but still a worthwhile allocation. Also ""low vol"" strategies have been unfathomably popular in recent years among institutional clients in particular and the very low beta of grocery had drawn further interest from those stock buyers.

I have no position on this up or down, and don't know the future. My reply is not at all a complete story of the grocery sector. You asked what may be missing and I think the macro/inflation side of your analysis is off to a good start but the details contain important nuances.

Warren Buffet has some sort of comment about that 1%. If you look at the most successful investors, you tend to see more value investors than traders. If the results were truly random then the distribution would be equal between traders and value investors.

Also trading has costs associated with it. Taxes, trading fees, and the like. You have to make sure you are calculating those into your returns. Paying income tax is almost twice as much as capital gains tax on something you've held for a year.

When was the last time you bought a stock without looking at the stock price chart?  Yeah, I thought so.  That's a form of technical analysis which a purist value guy wouldn't do.  But we all do it.  Charts can tell the history of a stock in a different way than a 10K, and sometimes we can identify price points where things can be interesting.

t3_75hlg0,do6i01u,"I agree with you.  Sort of.

There is no doubt some charges against earnings that are required by GAAP have no economic substance, and, if you want to understand the true earnings power of a company, they should be added back.  One clear example comes to mind.  Back when terrestrial radio stations used to be a thing (and even considered good businesses), if you bought a radio station, the accountants would require that most of the value of the acquisition be allocated to the broadcast license, which would then have to be depreciated over the remaining term of the license, even though the licenses are routinely renewed and were essentially for an indefinite period.  The required accounting depreciation didn't reflect any economic depreciation.

In many cases, sure, reasonable minds can differ, management can spin things however they want as long as they clearly reconcile their non-GAAP number back to GAAP.  A good analysts can then make their own determination as to what's reasonable or not.  In fact, the ability to sort through management's spin and get to economic reality is a great way for a good analyst to distinguish themselves from weak ones, and since I think I am one of the better ones, I am OK with the added challenge.

There are, however, many companies that abuse the non-GAAP process.  Some of the worst offenders are some of the high dividend paying companies that use dubious add-backs to make it look like they can cover their dividend, when clearly they can't.  A good analysts can see through what they do, but many retail investors are deceived and harmed.

I am conflicted.  I won't buy, on principal, the stock of any company that needs multiple line items to get to their adjusted earnings figure.  And, I frequently find myself morally offended when I think that management's non-GAAP number really doesn't reflect economic reality.  On the other hand, these situations often make for great shorts, so it would be against my interest to get rid of them.",2,1507659117,[],,,
t3_75hlg0,do6ujvi,"Sounds to me like you're going about it the right way. I may not have too much more to offer...

In practice, I find it useful to compare non-gaap adjustments to my own adjustments that I made and see where they differ. Kind of as an exec vs as an owner or potential owner type thing. Are we worried about the same things? Why, why not?

I conceptualize non-gaap as the financial equivalent of saying, ""Wait, wait, let me explain. It's not what it looks like..."" It gives the investor a chance to get a peek behind the curtain in some ways and see the company through the eyes of management, while knowing full well it could also be nothing more than a dog and pony show to attract new investment and/or to project a certain image to its peers.

So any time I look consider non-gaaps, I'm always curious as to the motivations and incentives that may be in place. What are they saying, and also what is NOT being said? 

* WHY does management feel the need to make line item xyz look so strong? Is it possible they feel pressure from peers, that they're worried that at first blush, its competition may look better off in this area? And if competition does look better in this area, why does competitor ABC not spruce up its figures in the same way?

* If it's a compensation thing, why? Does the adjustment make sense or should execs/etal be held to account for both sides of the bill?

* Is the company really an anomaly that's so hard to pin down with gaap? If so, can that understanding be taken to its peers in an effort to uncover some potential overlooked reality about the industry, etc that would impact peer ABC in a favorable way?

He talks about the pitfalls of DCF valuation, and suggests to use a combination of three valuation methods, the reproduction cost of assets, the earnings power value, and the value of growth. In practice, I've noticed that investors are used to value companies using multiples (EV/EBITDA in particular) because of their experience and expertise, but the basics lie in the aforementioned valuation methods. However, I'd suggest to use UNCONVENTIONAL metrics (e.g. some specific KPIs for a certain industry) if you really want to find value gaps.

t3_778oib,dom5lsw,"When I started investing, I built a custom DCF for each stock I purchased. I normalized the income statement and generally knew everything there was to know about the company before I bought it. But after doing so for a couple years, I accepted that the DCF was too dependent on a couple basic assumptions (eg. growth rate, gross margin, discount rates, etc...). Most DCFs I see have a 30%+ gap between the low value and high value in their sensitivity analysis. IMHO, that basically makes DCFs kinda useless. I'd rather use my time reading financial statements to find red flags. 

There is no single ratio that you can use to determine intrinsic value. I think too many people get caught up in single ratios. The statements have to be taken together as a whole to make any sense. Since you're in the learning stage, try running every ratio on every company that you research. You'll eventually realize that different ratios are more important for some industries than others.  You might even find that some ratios don't make sense in some industries. To give you an example, let's pretend that consulting firm ABC Inc sends employees out to client sites to perform high paid consulting engagements. As such, the company doesn't have much need for assets. They make boat loads of money and distribute it back to shareholders in the form of dividends. In this case, a price to book ratio is kind of irrelevant. It'll probably be much higher than a bank for example. Is it overpriced by comparison to a bank? Maybe. But you can't compare PB ratios. They don't mean the same thing. A PE ratio or dividend yield analysis would be more logical of metric to use. 

So let's say the PB ratio is 30, Dividend Yield is 7% and PE ratio is 10. Good deal? Maybe. Maybe not. That would depend on the income statement. How's their gross margin doing? Is it getting better? Worse? Staying flat? Should it be better than it currently is? How about competitors? Do they have a gross margin in line with ABC Inc? If not, why? Where does management say their gross margin will come in next year? Do they have a history of achieving forecasted results?

Rather than cut the distribution and have the GP share the pain (ETE being where Kelcy has his investment, and rather indebted itself), ETE perpetrated a ""stealth dividend cut"" by merging ETP with SXL.  ETP units paying $1.06 per quarter were exchanged for 1.5x SXL units paying $0.51 per quarter.... an effective dividend cut of 28%, while keeping all that distributed cash flow in the high splits by migrating it to from ETP's IDR structure to SXL's.  Then the merged entity was renamed as ETP.

Kelcy Warren is a piece of shit.  He even screwed over his fellow GP shareholders during last year's little whoopsie... when it was necessary for ETE to forego some IDRs to ""support"" ETP, he issued himself a private class of preferred to help maintain his own cash distributions.

Aging IDR structures cause the MLPs to have huge effective costs of capital if they can't sell equity at hefty premia, which means the GP has to do *some* restructuring.  The conflict of interest is almost never resolved in favor of LPs, who don't get a vote.  An exception is when WMB recently collapsed its IDR structure, and lowballed the GP valuation in favor of the LPs.

If these restructurings involve the partnership being dissolved, then the tax bill comes due for all those years of tax-free distributions.

2.  An even more devious way to achieve the above is through ""we're limiting distributions in order to fund growth"".  TGP is a good example of this - the distributions belong to the unitholders.  Withholding the distributions is effectively forcing the unitholders into reinvesting their proceeds for growth.  This would be good if it wasn't for the incentive distribution rights - which actually take a huge chunk of the reinvested distributions upside once the growth is completed and the distributions resumed.

What I'm trying to say is that we don't need Cinema as a medium to be trending up, to make AMC a good investment. 


There is a consolidation on going in the industry and the major ones will buy the small ones. This is what has been happening the last 10 years.

Yeah, Cinema isn't growing in the US but it is also not dying. 

Just some small details: 

1) Real Estate

On the conference calls Adam has said that they have never - never - been in a better position with their landlords. They _know_ they are the anchor of the mall (before it was Macys etc.). You come to watch a movie, and maybe buy a pair of pants. You dont go and buy a pair of pants - and then go to the movies. 

They are in a extremely good position to negotiate rents the coming 10 years, in a mall-america that is overbuilt and dying. 


Did you know that as of right now the mall owner pays for 30% of all renovations? 


2) PVOD

“Simultaneous opening of a movie in a theater and on cassettes is probably not more than two years away.” - NY Times, 1982


This threat has always existed, and always will. 


There is not a living chance that they will release Star Wars to a OTT-setup on the same day as it will release in the cinemas. Why?


1) There is no economics to it. To make it work for Disney they need to charge at least 50$ per viewing (""leaked documents"" from a negotiation from 2016, cited in a credit suisse report).


Would you pay 50$ to see it at home, or 15$ at the cinema? Gimme a break. 


2) As far as we know - Disney is the BIGGEST SUPPORTER of the theatre window. This is where they make their money.

There is no easy way out. Either you have the experience to react to markets accurately, or you play the guessing game like everyone else. Or you have clients who believe in value investing and are willing to ride the volatility, which tends to be rare. 

There's a reason why most professionals buy high and sell low. It's because it takes literally a decade to really understand markets well enough to play the short term game. So don't even bother trying, you're not going to be successful there. 

One shortcut is to really take the time to understand the largest 2-3 sectors which make up 50% of your benchmark (usually financials/energy/etc), then plan risk/reward exposures around them accordingly.

Less is more.

Overall, your work has a lot of “first level analysis”. This is analysis that is very obvious to anyone who looks at the Company, yet only scratches the surface without delving into the “why this happened and why it matters” part.

Apart from the earnings release, today it seemed like there was an analyst moving from buy to hold, which accounts for some of the move. I am not an expert in the stock, but I did a little bit of work on it a few weeks ago and thought it is fairly attractive at that valuation.

Overall, it's a lumpy business (with only a few projects at any time in backlog), and it sounds like analysts think there was a large boom in nat gas power plant constructions in the last few years that won't continue in the next few years as all of the in pipeline capacity gets taken online.  As existing pipeline is completed, AGX income will drop dramatically if new projects don't enter into the pipeline. All of this may have been further validated recently, I haven't done more research since the Q3 earnings/analyst updates.

Also, cash/investments decreased significantly in the recent filing (likely as a result of decreasing billings in excess of costs, which serve essentially as a form of customer provided financing). I am sure that the market understands this, but it does highlight that some of their cash will go away if backlog doesn't improve and new projects enter construction (providing a positive working capital situation with billings). 

Ultimately, the firm was in a boom time the last few years and income was very high. To me this indicates that in place earnings may not be the best representation going forward, especially with proof that backlog has decreased a ton. That being said, if you can get comfortable with their ability to replenish their pipeline, there seems to be some good value there.",9,1513038710,"[['AGX', 1]]",AGX,42.54999923706055,45.349998474121094

t3_7mq6ic,drvv0ef,"One thing I think you may be overlooking is an annual $3.7mn lease payment. If we capitalize that at 7x that is an extra $25.9mn lease obligation that should be factored in to their NAV. 

Another way to look at this business is that with $3.8mn 2016 EBITDA they currently trade at 0.1x EV/EBITDA - so very very cheap which aligns with your NAV calculation. 

However, factoring for their lease obligations gives you $7.5mn EBITDA for a multiple of 3.5x. 

This is still cheap, but I don't think its a good buy anymore because at that valuation you're not investing in the asset value, but the operating business instead. 

I haven't looked too deeply into the causes, so I assume this might be the result of your comments on MGM/starting up an online ticketing vendor, but per the Q you linked 9mo revenue is down -14% and net income down -65% YoY. The biggest red flag is that total operating expenses (incl. COGS) is only down -5% over the same period, so this is a very high fixed cost business.

But this is a tricky situation because even if their NAV was $14.9mn I don't think there is much a premise for a value investment here due to lack of catalyst...you may just end up sitting with a Company bleeding cash/ticking away the clock on their NOLs. You can't get bailed out by an acquisition because of tax leakage either. The fact that so much of the NAV comes from the NOLs is kinda sketchy too because the main benefit there is for cash accumulation, but if they're not returning cash to you (you said they stopped paying the dividend?) then its kinda like whats the point.

They could, and probably should, buy back stock if they wanted to. But my feeling is that might not happen because of the problems with their operating business. It'll be expensive to get a quality website going for them and there are costs to maintain that as well. Clearly they are in a situation where capex/R&D is needed, basically.

It is too bad their cash position wasn't higher, say around $10mn. It'd be a no brainer in that case. You could just have an activist come in and liquidate the Company for shareholders without regard for losing the NOLs.  ",17,1514503959,"[['NAV', 3]]",NAV,42.7599983215332,44.7599983215332

Also extremely important is in a lot of cities where Outfront is present, there is a huge barrier to entry because regulations prevent more billboards from being erected.

“I made a lot of mistakes, but I made one real doozy. So, this is kind of a funny story, at least it is 15 years later because the pain has subsided a little. But in 1999 after Yahoo and America Online had already gone up like tenfold, I got the bright idea at Soros to short internet stocks. And I put 200 million in them in about February and by mid-march the 200 million short I had lost $600 million on, gotten completely beat up and was down like 15 percent on the year. And I was very proud of the fact that I never had a down year, and I thought well, I’m finished.

So, the next thing that happens is I can’t remember whether I went to Silicon Valley or I talked to some 22-year-old with Asperger’s. But whoever it was, they convinced me about this new tech boom that was going to take place. So I went and hired a couple of gun slingers because we only knew about IBM and Hewlett-Packard. I needed Veritas and Verisign. I wanted the six. So, we hired this guy and we end up on the year – we had been down 15 and we ended up like 35 percent on the year. And the Nasdaq’s gone up 400 percent.

So, I’ll never forget it. January of 2000 I go into Soros’s office and I say I’m selling all the tech stocks, selling everything. This is crazy. [unint.] at 104 times earnings. This is nuts. Just kind of as I explained earlier, we’re going to step aside, wait for the net fat pitch. I didn’t fire the two gun slingers. They didn’t have enough money to really hurt the fund, but they started making 3 percent a day and I’m out. It is driving me nuts. I mean their little account is like up 50 percent on the year. I think Quantum was up seven. It’s just sitting there.

t3_7qdmkt,dsp72ht,"1. Mortgage prices should be valued (discounted) using the treasury or LIBOR curve, not mortgage interest rates.  All else equal, MBS investors who own premium bonds (priced above par) benefit from higher mortgage rates since this will reduce refis/turnover, thereby reducing premium payments and increasing value.  Also the interest rate path, not just the absolute value is important for expected prepayments.

2.  If you're trying to explain the price of (agency) mortgages, you want to add a Z spread to the TSY/LIBOR spot curve.  The Z spread is equal to a spread the bondholder receives for being short interest rate volatility (the bond has negative convexity) + model risk spread + illiquidity spread.  Thus, mortgage prices move down when volatility increases; rates are not the only input in pricing the mortgages.

3. As you mentioned, they're hedging duration (and convexity to some uncertain extent) with Pay Fix Interest Rate Swaps, Treasury Futures, short TBAs (MBS futures) , and long IOs.  If they're hedging interest rates, then the value if their portfolio is indifferent to changes in rates.

4.  If you subtract the volatility component from the z spread (derived using a multipath model), you get the OAS, option adjusted spread, which is the spread for liquidity and model risk.  This is also the spread a perfectly hedged investor earns over the life of a bond, assuming prepays behave in line with model.  Current OAS on specified pools are generally in the 30-60 range. This is low, but sell side analysts are expecting these to increase as the Fed reduced their balance sheet.  As OAS goes up, mortgage prices go down (all else equal), but future returns are increased. 

5. To calculate ROE, let's assume the funding rate is equal to risk free rate, they are 100% invested, and are perfectly duration/convexity hedged.  ORC's leverage ratio is ~ 9/1 Debt to equity.  On the 90% which is funded with debt, they earn only the OAS.  On the 10% cash investment they get OAS + the risk free rate.  This works out to 10 * OAS + Risk Free Rate.  If we assume a Libor OAS of 50 bps and RF rate of 1.5%, this works out to an ROE of 6.5% (less company expenses).  Clearly, to sustain a dividend higher than 6.5%, they have to reduce their equity, or earn a higher return than the OAS, which means they aren't fully hedging duration/convexity. 

As we can see below, they had an economic loss in Q4. This clearly indicates that they aren't perfectly hedging rates, which explains their higher ROE and greater variability in returns.  

>The Company’s estimated total return on equity for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was (0.2)%, or (0.9)% on an annualized basis. The Company calculates total return on equity as the sum of dividends declared and paid during the quarter plus changes in book value during the quarter, divided by the Company’s stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the quarter.  The total return was $(0.02) per share, comprised of dividends per share of $0.42 and a decrease in book value per share of $0.44 from September 30, 2017.


The performance of the stock is likely due to losses (decreases in portfolio net fair value), paying out more in dividends than monthly returns, and a a loss in confidence among investors that would cause the P/B to decrease.  Investing in a smaller firm like this has a lot of risks, especially if they aren't fully hedging.  Economies of scale allow REITs with larger balance sheets to have more sophisticated models, better talent and technology, better access to the street, and lower expenses per dollar of equity. 

Let me know if you have more questions.

Also this thing is externally managed so management is taking its fee irrespective and that is eating into capital. Cash on the BS is needed for all their swaps and what not.

* Capital raise because the bank will only give you loans as long as you've got enough capital based on risk profile of interest coverage.

I rarely find value in 'value' stocks either, just low volatility until something changes, and that change is usually something that disrupts their business model to make your 'value' stock considerably less valuable.

You're gonna have a bad time with this kinda thinking. 

But anyway, I appreciate the breadth of your post, but you shouldn't buy stocks simply because they have a low valuation and I also think you're too generous with your assumptions for a retailer. 

Taking tangible book value from their Q3 BS I get a price to tangible book value of ~1.2x, in-line with your thinking. However, this assumes that stated book value is fair value. I disagree. 

Discount AR by 75%, inventory by 50%, and pre-paid by 50% as well. I can promise you 100% that a competitor will not pay book value for inventory, for instance. I have no insight into their PPE but lets assume they can get 85% for that. 

This gets you tangible assets of $845mn vs. book value $1.5bn. Net tangible assets are now -$253.0mn. 

However, you're also overlooking their leases. In 2016 the Company paid $189mn in rental expense, so capitalizing that at 7x gets you an additional $1.3bn liability to add to the balance sheet. 

So even assuming full book value for tangible assets this still puts you at a -$889mn net asset deficit. 

Your logic on valuation is not really that off, but in this particular instance I think your price action is the result of dumb luck rather than its book value being a leading indicator.

Last years revenues were around 1.2 billion I believe. 

They announced today their new streaming service, which is a monthly subscription between 8-12 dollars. They have estimates of global viewers of north of 350 million people, however there has been reports that viewership was closer to 300 million. 

If 10% of the 300 million subscribe, at an average of $10 a month, that’s potentially $3 billion in revenue. Add on to the existing revenue streams from circuits and other tv contracts. 

The big date I’m waiting for is in 2020, when the current Concorde agreement expires, and the new owners will have the opportunity to renegotiate the current payments to teams. There is a huge push to reduce costs, encouraging new manufacturers to join, further improving the quality of the spectacle ie more viewers. 

I’m a huge fan, so I definitely have some optimistic bias for the sport. 

they have three classes of shares (A,B,K), I was reading their 10-k the other day and they have around 80,000,000 shares outstanding each around $32 per share (~2.5 $billion) and a market cap of 7.7 billion. If their streaming service is successful, and are able to grow viewers, they could potentially double or triple their revenues in just a few years. 

I’m pretty new to equity research, and as a big fan, I’m in dangerous territory of confirming my biases. I’m pretty familiar with the other revenue sources the sport has, and would love to help answer questions if I can.

This guidance excludes any year-end impairments and store closing charges, as well as any tax effects related to the recently enacted tax reform legislation.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638018000003/a991-holidaysales2017.htm)

Then it goes on to state:

>The Company anticipates reporting fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2017 results in late March, and **will provide fiscal 2018 guidance at that time**.

If I may be so bold, I believe you’re looking at their FY2017 guidance as FY2018 guidance. 

What bothers me, is you’re not alone. A Ivanka Thompson over at Bangladore Weekly said

>[Gamestop Corporation (NYSE:GME) issued an update on its FY18 earnings guidance on Thursday morning. The company provided earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $3.10-3.40 for the period, compared to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate of $3.33.](http://bangaloreweekly.com/2018-02-08-gamestop-corporation-gme-updates-fy18-earnings-guidance/)

So perhaps that is where you got your misinformation or perhaps I am the one who is mistaken. Ive looked on Edgar and GameStop’s [site](http://news.gamestop.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130125&p=irol-sec&secCat01.2_rs=11&secCat01.2_rc=10&control_symbol=) and to quote Space Balls, man I aint found shit.

>GME pays an effective tax rate of 32%, and lowering this to a conservative estimate of 20%

Even if they have released FY2018, why do you suspect they wouldn’t adjust their estimates for the federal tax changes?

>especially considering that GME gave this exact guidance range last year and cruised comfortably over the top.

This line further leads me to believe that you’ve mistakenly taken FY2017 guidance as FY2018 guidance, but Im still open to the fact Im missing something myself.

Thanks for the DD, but GME is a value trap. The main points are games are moving to digital, you can see this in the divergence between GME’s new software sales growth and the industry software sales growth. They’ve also faced competition for used games from Walmart, BestBuy, Amazon, and Craigslist. The introduction of selling used iPads has helped them maintain their bottom line and Im sure selling collectibles will help in much the same way. Apparently some MBA at HQ finally figured out that a bunch of empty boxes wasn’t an ideal use of shelf space. I believe the logical next step for gaming is a Netflix type subscription model, which I believe exists via Gamefly. If not, apparently Google [wants in on it](http://fortune.com/2018/02/07/google-yeti-video-game-streaming/). It’s rather unlikely that a brick and mortar retail store like GME would be able to offer much competition in such a space, but I could be wrong. 

In other words, I believe the market is pricing GME more or less appropriately.

“**EBITDA**” means, for any period, **Net Income** for such period plus (a) without duplication and solely to the extent deducted (and not added back or excluded) in determining Net Income for such period (other than clause (vi) and (vii)), the sum of (i) **Interest Expense** for such period, (ii) income tax expense for such period, including, without limitation, franchise or similar taxes, net of tax benefits (other than benefits payable to the sellers pursuant to the **Acquisition Agreement**), (iii) all amounts attributable to depreciation and amortization expense for such period, (iv) any other non-cash losses, expenses or charges for such period (provided that if any such non-cash charges represent an accrual or reserve for potential cash items in any future period, (1) the Borrower may determine not to add back such non-cash charge in the current period and (2) to the extent the Borrower does decide to add back such non-cash charge, the cash payment in respect thereof in such future period shall be subtracted from EBITDA to such extent), (v) fees (including termination fees) and expenses paid or accrued pursuant to the **Management Agreement**, (vi) cash received in respect of a non-cash gain deducted from EBITDA pursuant to clause (b)(ii) below in a prior period, (vii) the amount of “run rate” net cost savings, operating expense reductions and revenue increases projected by the Borrower in good faith to result from actions taken prior to the date of determination of EBITDA (and which revenue increases must result from written contractual agreements entered into by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries with franchisees, vendors and other third parties prior to the date of determination of EBITDA) (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions and revenue increases, as applicable, had been realized on the first day of the period for which EBITDA is being determined and if such cost savings, operating expense reductions and revenue increases, as applicable, were realized during the entirety of such period), net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such agreements that, a Financial Officer of the Borrower shall have certified to the Administrative Agent that such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable (it being understood that any such adjustments shall be without duplication of cost savings or additional costs already deducted from net income, or included as an addback to EBITDA, for such period, including any **Pro Forma Adjustments**), (viii) the amount of any other extraordinary or non-recurring fees or cash charges, losses or expenses for such period, (ix) the amount of any severance costs, restructuring costs and business optimization expenses for such period, (x) any fees, charges and other expenses (including severance costs) made or incurred during such period, or any amortization thereof for such period, in connection with any acquisition or **Investment**, the **Transactions**, the **Acquisition**, the Effective Date Transactions, the issuance, repayment or amendment of **Indebtedness** (whether or not consummated), any disposition, or issuance of capital stock, including the capital stock of any parent company, in each case, permitted to be incurred by this Agreement and whether or not successful or completed (that are paid or otherwise accounted for within 365 days of such transactions (or the proposed transactions to the extent not consummated)), (xi) pre-opening and opening costs and expenses (including related consulting fees) not to exceed the greater of (A) $5.0 million and (B) 6.25% of EBITDA for such period (giving pro forma effect to a **Specified Transaction** to the extent required or permitted pursuant to Section 1.05 and determined prior to giving effect to any adjustments pursuant to this clause (xi)), (xii) cash losses realized upon the sale, disposition or discontinuance of assets that are not sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, (xiii) cash payments in respect of earn outs and contingent consideration obligations (including to the extent accounted for as bonus or otherwise), minus (b) without duplication and to the extent included in Net Income (other than clause (i)), (i) any cash payments made during such period in respect of non-cash charges described in clause (a) taken in a prior period, (ii) non-cash items increasing such Net Income for such period (other than any items which represent the reversal of any accrual of, or cash reserve for, anticipated charges in any prior period where such accrual or reserve is no longer required) and (iii) cash gains realized upon the sale, disposition or discontinuance of assets that are not sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, all calculated for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) for any period, the aggregate amount of adjustments pursuant to clauses (a)(vii), (ix) and (xi) of the definition of EBITDA, shall not exceed 15% of EBITDA for such period (giving pro forma effect to a Specified Transaction to the extent required or permitted pursuant to Section 1.05 and determined prior to giving effect to any adjustments pursuant to clauses (a)(vii), (ix) and (xi) of the definition of EBITDA).

“**Interest Expense**” means, with reference to any period, total interest expense (including that attributable to **Capital Lease Obligations**) of the Borrower and its **Restricted Subsidiaries** for such period with respect to all outstanding Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including all commissions, discounts and other fees and charges owed with respect to letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances and net costs under Swap Agreements in respect of interest rates, to the extent paid or required to be paid in cash for such period, to the extent such net costs are allocable to such period in accordance with GAAP), calculated for the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for such period in accordance with GAAP.

t3_837asb,dvgrmlm,"Editing answer to add some examples and to add some ways to play this out:

There are several possible outcomes for vacated commercial space due to retail store closures:

1. Conversion to residential spaces (http://www.businessinsider.com/americas-first-shopping-mall-is-now-micro-apartments-2016-10)
2. Conversion to office space. The link below shows one such example of office space, but also has examples for conversion to church, medical center, and even an ice rink --  https://gizmodo.com/7-dead-shopping-malls-that-found-surprising-second-live-1634073681
3. Space is taken over by new entrants such as Aldi or expanding retailers such as Dick's sporting goods
4. Space is taken over by government agencies  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastmont_Town_Center)
5. Space converted to brick and mortar stores of online stores (Eg: Amazon store) or for warehouses (eg: https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-place-for-a-new-warehouse-an-old-mall-1502190001)

One caveat - the conversions to residential or office space needs significant reinvestment. Not sure how hard it is to get credit / debt for these conversions. It might be interesting to look at the interest rates for debt on such conversions.

On how to take advantage of the glut of commercial space:

1. I think shorting a levered REIT has some risk if they do a good job with conversion. Again, looking at the reinvestment costs and interest rates might give a clue as to whether a particular REIT has the ability to do these conversions. Another key question- can the REIT do piecemeal sales of some malls and reinvest that money in converting existing malls? 

2. I'd say its probably better risk /reward option to invest in an REIT that's specifically ""up-converting"" the run down malls to higher use.  One example might be Seritage (disclosure: not invested in Seritage because I see better options out there, but must admit that Seritage looks very interesting)

t3_83w48d,dvlhx34,"Welcome to distressed investing. I've been in the space for a number of years and I still find it hard to get good information even working for well known firm. I'm interested in seeing replies to this post so I can also make recommendations to job applicants trying to learn more. 

Depending on the company and type of obligation and the country youre in etc (I'm in the USA), many documents you are looking for will often filed publicly somewhere or they will not be available at all unless they are sent to you [1].

It sounds like this is more for a job interview to show off your skills or to get your feet wet, my recommendation would be to start with a fixed income idea from a public company that issued debt sold to the public and filed a prospectus (424). EDGAR will have a lot of what you need for free available online. If a distressed company is already in court the court will have the docs and you can request them (will have to pay clerk fees and wait for them though most likely). For an example here is a recent $450 million 2.6% 2020 Note sold by another airline (Delta) and you can find the prospectus for the debt and the company's other filings right on EDGAR easily:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/27904/000119312517355872/d492456d424b5.htm

Another good thing about a fixed income idea at this point based on a company who's stock is also traded publicly is you can get a lot of the research info you need from the public company filings and quarterly reports and from research focused on the equity. No it's not the exactly the type of work done in many distressed investing deals but you can't really do that for real until you have access to company information you won't find online. 

When you talk to an interviewer you can and should mention that you are interested in private debt opportunities and foreign securities and maybe rattle off a few names > and anyone normal interviewing you will understand when you tell them you didn't have enough access to bloomberg terminal data and you didn't want to bother calling a HY broker contact to get info and documents as you can't honestly claim to be a potential buyer (not yet ;) so you didn't want to pitch an idea without being able to do enough due diligence on it. 

[1] Possible ""pro tip"" when asking a broker or sales desk for something ask about 2-3 companies even if you are really only focused on 1 of the companies as it throws of the scent of what you're really looking at to buy. Is this unnecessary and ridiculous overkill of suspicion about the competition in distressed investing? yes it is and I see it every day. 

Feel free to ask any questions if you have.

t3_83w48d,dvlns2h,"Echo below response with focusing on a publicly listed Company that has outstanding bonds. You'll be able to find the indenture, credit agreement, security agreement, etc fairly easily. I like BamSEC for this reason since I can toggle between different types of reports and quickly thumb through exhibits (all of what I listed are almost always an attached exhibit to an 8k). 

But since your focus is on getting a job, what I think you should try to communicate with your work is that you understand how to frame a credit analysis. So your mentality should be ""how wrong can this go before I'm in trouble"" as opposed to ""how high can my rocket ship fly"" which you typically see in equity analysis. 

A big component to this will be covenant analysis, which is gonna be tricky to wrap your head around at first and you may need to put a legal hat on, but understanding your protections as a bondholder and the flexibility the issuer has in making restricted payments, etc is immensely important. 

What I think is a very overlooked aspect of credit analysis is having a thorough understanding of how the organizational chart flows. There are distressed situations that can get 90% of the way figured out just by having your head wrapped around a complicated org chart that just needs time to untangle. So this means understanding who the guarantor/nonguarantor subs are, where the unrestricted subsidiaries are, who has a claim on what and vise versa, where does equity flow, who gets residuals, etc...I like to think of this stuff as one big deal, and if you can figure out how the deal has been set up and who it benefits the most then thats probably the side you wanna be on. 

I personally find these types of situations the most interesting to work on and they lend themselves to a lot of creative thinking. 

So I think you could approach looking at a situation in one of two ways 1) find a public company that is stressed or 2) find a public/private company that is in bankruptcy and take a stab at coming up with a recovery waterfall / exit plan. It'll most likely be wrong, but at least getting yourself exposed to that stuff will be a good learning experience. 

For bankruptcies, figure out which docket service a firm is using such as PrimeClerk. You don't need to pay any fees to get these documents although it can be a pain to navigate at first. Here is what you should find. 1) The DIP credit agreement, 2) the First Day declaration by the CEO / CFO / CRO (these are gems of information about the background which led to restructuring and how they plan to fix it, and usually contain a treasure chest of company specific information, 3) take the time to make an excel sheet of all of the bankers and lawyers for each creditor class (it is not a waste of time to just call these people up, even partners, and see if they if they'll talk (lawyers likely not, bankers are chatty). 

Its really just something that you need to dive in head first to figure out. 

I personally think a good situation for you to take a stab at, where you can get exposure to both company-specific, fundamental problems and covenant specific problems is Revlon. ",6,1520896438,[],,,

There are real fears that business models that rely primarily on monetizing user data (see Google, Facebook), may take a hit due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the #DeleteFacebook movement.

t3_89l1d6,dwrxb5z,"It's been a while and I only have a few min, but I see two things missing from your list of considerations. Namely- 

1. the loss ratio in P&C typically hovers just above 1, that is usually premiums are slightly below claims with the float (premiums you hold and invest before claims are paid) making up the difference and being the profit generator. This effectively means, as an insurer, your business is to pay a few percent to policyholders to get access to investment capital.

2. The P&C market is very commoditized and relatively efficient. There is some brand loyalty, but generally people flip easily for a better price. This is even more true in direct (i.e. not through an agent) sales like Geico does. Geico has some customer loyalty, but their primary economic moat is cost competitiveness. 

My takeaway being that you can effectively value policyholders as the difference between the cost of capital from their float and your cost of capital on the market. (With some other terms like your ability to generate cash from that capital like available investments or regulatory restrictions.) You can then value that over time using some discount function based almost entirely on competitive position via lowest cost and attractiveness of cost to consumers.",2,1522814487,[],,,
t3_89l1d6,dwskrro,"Let's start with the full section:

> *The excess over tangible net worth of the implied value – $2.7 billion – was what we estimated GEICO’s “goodwill” to be worth at that time.* That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholders who were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in premiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO’s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were annually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary insurer: Because of the company’s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.

That $2.7B value comes from Buffett's estimate of goodwill. Let's be clear - goodwill is just an accounting term and different from intrinsic value. He isn't describing his estimate of intrinsic value.

The intrinsic value, above tangible book, is the result of excess profitability over the cost of capital. This is going to be the result of a competitive advantage, a sustainable moat. Marketing scale is what does it for GEICO - I've heard folks say cost efficiency, and there likely is some impact from that and/or risk pricing, but the biggest thing (as an industry insider) is the marketing scale. They spend the most and also likely the least per customer. They're ridiculously tough to compete with.

I think Warren was just being playful in his description of the value. I don't think these few paragraphs are great at his view on the float - there are so many caveats to valuing insurance float that I don't think it's worthwhile to focus on that in most cases. In this case, the competitive advantage Warren has with GEICO is far more valuable. The float helps, but only marginally in a short tailed business like auto insurance. Still, there's a benefit, but focus on other aspects for the sake of learning.",2,1522851151,[],,,

Third, I'm going to make up some numbers so you get a feel for how we think here. 

**Imaginary oil business valuation**

Revenue = $1m (assume 0% growth from previous year)

x Gross margin 70% aka If I sell a bottle for $10, making it cost me $3 once I account for labor, materials etc – this normally reflects the costs that change depending on how much you make/sell

= 700k gross profit -  this is the profit that changes depending on how much you sell

- SG&A of 500k (these are the costs that happen no matter how much you sell, example rent, legal bills, staff payroll etc

- Depreciation of $100k, this assumes the business owns big things like the building, machinery etc to account for the wear and tear on the machinery/building 

Operating Profit = $100k ($700-500-100)

Bank loan of 5% on $400k = $20k (not really but close enough)

Income before tax = $80k

Tax = 24k (30% federal plus state)

Net Income = $56k

6x-12x OI = 600k-$1,200k for the value of the whole company – 400k debt = $200-800k i.e. 100-400k for 50%

As you can see, being fairly conservative the number is fairly low ball. Here is some things that can swing things materially

•	The deceased paid himself a salary of $200k a year, that will no longer be necessary. You can add that back.

•	Inventory is piling up to the roof, most of it should be thrown away

•	The machine they use to make the oil is super old and the business needs a new one

•	The business is growing, 10% a year, or going the other way…..

A discount rate of 100% in turn implies the expected loss of invested capital is 100% (i.e. the company doesn't even liquidate assets but combusts into flames with zero remaining residual value). Which I assume is a far-fetched scenario for this company. That the present value of all future cash flows will not exceed one year's worth of cash flow.

1. Knowing that Michelin has no debt (although you contradicted yourself with .2 Debt/Equity implying that they DO have debt), with a current ratio of 1.83 and a Baa1 Moody's credit rating, what is my key takeaway.  You need to look at other comparable companies and look at their credit rating, debt levels, ratios, etc to compare across the board.  Looking at one company's ratios does very little.
2. Why care about Book Value per Share?  I understand that it is an important ratio for ""maximum downside in a bankruptcy case.""  But what about EV/EBITDA, Total Debt/EBITDA, etc.  Those are more important metrics.
3. Do I really care about how the company returns shareholder value whether they do it via dividends or share repurchases?  As long as they are generating a positive ROE above their WACC then as an investor I am happy.

In general, buying something where half of the business is shrinking and the other half growing is not a good trade. Because there are many stocks where all of the business is growing. So investors would pile in here only if the value is very very clear.

As a fact, valuation here is pretty rich if you look at FCF multiples and PE. EBITDA alone doesn’t feel so relevant considering the size of capex still required here. You should do some more work on valuation and compare to other challenged industries, but also wireless. If your thesis is value, just make sure there is real value and not wishful, cherry picked multiples. Take a lot at wireless for example, EBITDA-cash flow multiples there vs in cable.

The TV business has lower EBITDA but also requires virtually no capex. Basically cable is many decades old technology. So you need to look at the cash flows and approximate with EBITDA-capex. EBITDA is not relevant for a business which requires huge capex. And the broadband business will continue to require huge capex.

Look at pricing. Cable doesn’t have a broadband monopoly, they often compete with at least one other broadband provider. Perhaps with worse speeds, but still, at much lower price. Will consumers accept rising broadband prices forever, or witch once they reach a tipping point? At that time, Altice will have to both increase marketing spend and decrease prices. Which will be a double whammy to the P&L.

Finally, the growing debt mountain is a huge issue. Debt costs are increasing, not decreasing. Banks and markets may reach a tipping point when they require higher rates due to the underlying risks here. While price increases in broadband keep coming, many consumers are accepting them. But that’s due to the strong economy. Altice may be hit by a double whammy of much higher debt costs, increasing churn (requiring more marketing spend) and a shrinking top line both on the TV and broadband side. It’s not cheap enough even on an EBITDA basis (8.6x this year) for all these risks, when you can buy Verizon at 6.6x EBITDA. But as I said, look at that post capex too. And wireless has a potential step up in revenues due to 5G and connected vehicles moving forward, while cable upside is limited other than in terms of price. There is no “new market” for cable to address.

If you own an investment for the long-term, as I prefer to do, then your investment return is primarily a function of changes in company value, which in turn is a function of ROIC, hence the need to focus on companies with a high ROIC.

This creates problems when (most) companies see their high returns revert to the mean (cost) resulting a double whammy where growth slows and the multiple contracts.

The opposite is true with companies currently earning low returns on capital. They tend to be overly discounted by the market, but on average, their returns improve over time towards the cost - resulting in improved earnings growth and an expansion in multiple. This is a long winded way of explaining the value premium.

Everyone wants to be the next Buffett and buy a great company at a fair price and let the business compound away at high rates for many years, resulting in one of the best investment track records of all time.

Because of this, CVRs have a number of quirks which make them harder to value. They biggest issue is that they are generally non-transferable, meaning that if you acquire the stock ahead of a merger and receive a CVR as a result, you'll have to sit and wait for the CVR to mature before you can get liquidity. 

The vast majority of the CVRs I've come across are in pharma. Shire's acquisition of Dyax is a good example. Most of these are contingent on a drug the acquired company is working on receiving FDA approval. The CVRs' payouts are contingent on FDA approval, quarterly revenue resulting from the drugs, or other future unknowns. 

Another type of CVR is similar to the one which you described above, where you know for certain you will receive a payment, but the timing and amount of the payment is uncertain. Don't overlook the costs associated with the sale of the assets or with the administration of the CVR as these can add up and take out significant value from the distribution. A good example of this is the CVR Safeway owners received from Albertson's buyout of Safeway. The CVR entitled former Safeway owners to receive the net proceeds related to the sale of their 49% ownership stake in Casa Ley, a Mexican grocery chain. Albertson's had 4 years to liquidate the stake, which they took all four years to execute on. In the end, it was a fall smaller payday for Safeway owners than they had initially hoped for.
(BTW I have spoken to probably a dozen securities law firms about finding a way to circumvent the non-transferability features of CVRs. Despite the $ invested in finding a solution, none of the lawyers have been able to come up with an executable plan).",9,1529342365,"[['CVR', 6]]",CVR,31.200000762939453,31.950000762939453

 - NRZ is still overwhelmingly a play on rates with MSRs and servicer advances composing a majority of the portfolio. Even if rates stall (which prob is not that big an if seeing as inflation is still underwhelming), the refi boom is behind us and, barring a resurgent ZIRP, prepayments shouldn’t be an issue.

 - Shellpoint acquisition means more originations means more volume. More volume usually equals a better cost of funding, which is important because NRZs securitizations are below average in quality.

On self-driving cars
>We have found that the hype about self-driving cars is wildly overblown […]. The issue is you can’t get 90% of the way there, you have to get 100% of the way there, and the last 10%, in fact the last 1% is harder than the entire 99% that comes before it. It requires enormous investment, not just in road miles but in simulation technology. […] You will see self-driving cars that have Level 4 [ie. the driver don’t have to pay attention but the car is limited to a geo-fenced area] capability in very limited areas next year but you won’t see this on a widespread basis for a couple of decades probably.

On cloud
>[AWS] first started to really trying to win over developers but they found that you can’t build a big enterprise business just by attracting developers […]. You have to engage with […] people higher up in organizations in order to develop a serious enterprise relationship. They have come from zero there but they had a seven year head start and they are developing those relationships.
Microsoft has had those relationships so with their Azure effort, they were really able to go in and provide an on ramp to their existing customers […].
If you want to win in the enterprise and sell technology to enterprises, it is very important to nail the sales piece of it as well as the technology piece. Google has really good technology but I think they are still figuring the sales piece. Even Azure has taken some time to figure out their sales strategy and how they want to sell cloud. We think Google has great technology; in particular their artificial intelligence solutions are very impressive […] whereas Amazon is working on it.


In another question:
>There is plenty of market left for both of these companies [AMZN & MSFT] to take. The potential size of the market is very large, the amount is a trillion dollars’ worth of IT spend. […] [MSFT] are going to be a player in this market, but I don’t know that it necessarily takes away from AWS either because the two companies run in their own lanes. Microsoft developers and people who use a lot of .NET etc. tend to go with Azure for their needs and the people who do more open source work and are building more stuff from scratch, tend to go with AWS.",10,1531092075,[],,,

On tariffs
>The  tariffs  to  date  are  quantitatively  small  by  any  macroeconomic  metric.  If  businesses  around  the  world  could  know  that  these measures,  or  even  some  reasonable  multiple  of  them,  were  the  end of  the  tit-for-tat,  the  damage  done  would  be  sectoral only and would not materially change the growth outlook. For example, even if the US were  to  impose  tariffs  on  as  much  as  $150bn  of  imports  from  China  and  there  was  a  proportionate response, that is still a manageable number compared with the roughly $2trn of global Chinese exports, or the trillions of dollars of global US imports. The key question is if this is where it stops.



On the US fiscal profile
>US 2y Treasury yields are the most  attractive  among  the  G10  economies  and  even  exceed  many emerging  markets. [...] Global  investors  might  have  decided  that  US  Treasuries  are not as risk free as they thought and might be demanding more compensation. After all, it  is  unprecedented  for  the  US  to  pass  fiscal stimulus  with  an  economy  around  full  employment, as has happened in this cycle. The US fiscal profile is now the worst since the 1940s, with the federal budget deficit set to rise over 5% of GDP in 2019. ",11,1531071484,[],,,

So I have been following Hypotenuse Capital for a while - they are not doing so hot. In their Q2 letter port. mngr Michael Lee stopped talking names the company invests in, and stating:


""Over the years, the circulation of this letter has increased considerably beyond the Partners of the Fund and there are many readers who
are not invested in the Partnership; more recently copies can be found in various places on the internet. ""


He went on to say that it is his fiduciary duty to stop disclosing this info. He also used the Q2 letter to explain why using a concentrated portfolio is ideal as opposed to diversifying. His logic is that mathmatically, your odds of generating alpha are higher if you invest in fewer stocks (but fails to mention that under-performance is also magnified)  I suspect that Mr. Lee is getting torn apart. 65% of his port is invested in 5 companies.

It's the same principle when you buy a bond -- the value of the bond is the discounted value of future cash coupons you receive.

It's the same principle when you buy a property -- the value of the property is the discounted value of the future rent after expenses that you receive.

To understand why DCFs look at cash flows rather than earnings you need to understand why they might be different, along with the time value of money.

The reason they might be different is because accounting standards try to reflect the economic value creation of a business, rather than when cash is received.

Here's an example. You have a consulting business that's going to consult for 2 years on a project, and get paid $1m in year 1, and $2m in year 2, with the payment being higher in the 2nd year because the project's complete, but the work done is the same  throughout.

Accounting earnings will typically treat this as $1.5m revenue per year because that's when the work was done and the value was created, even though you only received $1m cash in the first year.

How do you value this business? Time value of money means that $1 received today is worth more than $1 received tomorrow (or in a year, or 2 years, or 10 years). A DCF would value it based on $1m received in 1 year and $2m in 2 years, which more accurately reflects the value of the timing of those cash flows than $1.5m/year.

On DNVBS:  Yes, digital tranformation has lowered barriers to entry by allowing anyone to sell anything online and these certain digital DTC brands like dollar shave club, Warby Parker, Casper and Purple have gone viral and done well; however, in order to maintain growth for their business they  need to spend a  significant % of revenue on customer acquisition mainly through advertising, otherwise they are just fads. If you look at the Kylie Jenner articles, yes she is viral and doing well and yes she probably has double the operating margin on traditional beauty companies by saving on marketing expense, but how sustainable is her ""brand""? How do you replicate the fame the Kardashians have gotten since Kylie was maybe 10 years old or sth? 

On Amazon: Yes Amazon is an amazing logistics company but I think your point that Amazon produces their own private label product is silly. They most likely outsource to manufacturers that produce it for them. For example, Amazon recently started selling diapers. Who manufacturers it for them? Rumor has it KMB does. Now it is true Amazon probably has more bargaining power in this relationship than KMB but make no mistake- Amazon NEEDS manufacturers like KMB. The diaper market is basically a duopoly between KMB's Huggies and P&G's Pampers. There is no way Amazon will want to be in the capital intensive business of producing diapers.

On Innovation: Yes some of the big CPG and HPC brands have gotten too comfortable and lacked innovation in some of their categories that they previously managed for profit as cash cow) However, to say that consumer good spend nothing on innovation is simply just not true and many brands have taken their market share losses in the past few years as a wake up call and starting to fight back. The question I think you should be asking is not that whether these brands are innovating, but whether their innovation would be fruitless as category becomes commoditized Amazon does best when category becomes commoditized. Look at what they did in batteries. 

Ultimately I'm not saying the legacy brands like Unilever, P&G and KMB  are going to do well- they have many challenges ahead of them and more importantly all of them are still figuring out how to adapt to the new digital landscape. However, to discount them and say their brands are worthless and that AMZN will destroy them is equally asinine. Amazon detergent will likely have trouble competing with Tide.

t3_985nss,e4jodoc,"Oh boy the ole Amazon is gonna kill brands thesis.... \*gets out popcorn\*

But on a more serious note, I really don't see how Amazon, or more specifically online distribution, will ""end brands"" as a competitive advantage. Sure, online distribution may make brands slightly less valuable for the producer to squeeze out extra economic returns, but the core value proposition for brands is more structural, in my opinion. Finally, social media has reduced the cost of advertising for ALL brands, not just the small ones. 

First off, this idea isn't new and in fact some were talking about this threat since the Internet became a significant force on commerce. Heres an HBR article talking about it in 2000: [https://hbr.org/2000/03/cost-transparency-the-nets-real-threat-to-prices-and-brands](https://hbr.org/2000/03/cost-transparency-the-nets-real-threat-to-prices-and-brands)

Perhaps the debate has heated up more recently due to online retailing and social media hitting critical mass across a wide swath of consumers. In any case, brands offer attributes to the consumer that have and will continue to have value, regardless of the distribution method, in my view. 

One argument is that online retailing has increased price transparency. This may be true for high priced goods and for goods that typically have many SKUs per product (electronics are an example.) But for Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG), price transparency has been available to shoppers for decades. Supermarket shelves have the price for branded goods and private label (PL) goods right next to each other. Many retailers provide price per unit as well. The Internet has not changed this dynamic, just continued it.

Brands are popular for CPG items because of three fundamental factors: a consumer's resources are finite (time & money), they are often lower priced items and they have very short useful lives. 

The value of brands for CPG is that they reduce a consumer's ""search costs."" Search costs are inherently nebulous but can be conceptualized as any cost the consumer bears when making a decision when buying a product. Search costs as a % of the goods price drops as the real price of that item to the consumer falls i.e. you might spend a month researching what car to buy but you won't spend 30 seconds when selecting toothpaste.

I believe this is the fallacy that people leave out when they argue the Internet reduces ""search costs."" Yes, the Internet reduces the time it takes to find out about new products but I believe it does not significantly reduce the time it takes to make the purchasing decision. And I believe rational economic analysis bears this out.

Lets assume the average online shopper makes $50k/year at 40 hours per week. That comes out to a marginal value opportunity cost of $0.40 cents per minute. If you are looking at toothbrushes in Walmart for 10 minutes and the different in price is less than $4, youve already lost any value you would have gained by selecting the PL over the brand. So people either choose randomly, or they go with the brand they know works well and trust. In the case of food and drink, it could be the one they know like the taste of (i.e. Heinz ketchup as it relates to the Kraft Heinz example.)

So when someone searches for toothpaste on Amazon, they wont spend 15 minutes searching for an option. Perhaps at first. But eventually you resort to other factors since its just not worth your time. That's why brands do and will still have value. Online retailers have star ratings and reviews but this is just data thrown at the customer. No one is going to search through pages of reviews to see if the PL of something is equivalent in quality to the branded product. The reviews are there but they add little actual value for CPG items.

The Internet is already exhibiting methods that store retailers utilize to reduce search costs. Amazon lets brands pay for slotting at the top of search results aka Sponsored Items. Search any myriad of CPG items on Amazon and the usual suspects have the sponsored slots (P&G, KC, Kraft Heinz, etc.) This is no different than slotting fees paid to grocery chains so that you are the only product stocked at eye level. That's right, consumers are so willing to reduce search costs that company's will pay for the ability to be the product that consumers WONT have to bend down to look at or pick up. 

Sorry for the long post but I suppose the TL; DR would be: humans are inherently efficient i.e. lazy and they will do anything to reduce the time it takes to find what they want and get them on their way quickly. Brands help them do that, whether shopping in-store or online.",2,1534809243,"[['CPG', 4]]",CPG,6.369999885559082,6.679999828338623

A lot of the reasons you mention for the decline in brand importance have been around for quite a while and in the absence of full information, a consumer will still value a recognized brand.

Big ads lead to big shelf space lead to big sales, except now owning the shelf is less important.

Subscription models (Dollar Shave, etc) and acquisition models (Casper, etc) can easily be duplicated and provide no competitive advantage what can't be duplicated is a platform that creates thousands of sellers in minutes. How can Newell compete with thousands of efficient drop shippers selling similar products on a highly recognized platform when they no longer have brand value?

We need more financial information, the ratios you provide don’t have much context without it. How large is this company and what is the valuation? What are the margins like?

Anyway, more generally it’s difficult to justify a short purely based on overvaluation. A quality short needs clear and identifiable catalysts which majorly impact the business. My favorites would be bankruptcy risk, fraud, etc

Burberry isn’t a great comparable - way broader portfolio of products, different size, geographic presence, etc dramatically alters risk profile of the investments. Try to keep in mind comps are predicated on similar risk profiles.

The ownership structure (/absolutely tiny float) is definitely a risk factor to the play - short squeeze is definitely possible.

HA - For an Airline, HA does have above average moat. However HA doesn't rank within top 5 of its industry (ryaay is no. 1). Similarly my valuation shows it to be undervalued, at least 45% below valuation. My concern is how long those FCF can be sustained. If they want to continue expanding / maintain market share, buying new planes is a requirement. With expected capex and margin compression from competition, I'm on the fence for this one. It also seems that they might have some short term liquidity issues. Personally I avoid airlines due to the nature of the industry - high capex, cut throat margins.

LEA - Undervalued, good growth. However, it is a large cap and whether it can maintain its growth depends on the auto industry, which I would apply a larger discount for the cyclical nature of auto industry. It's moat seems to be on the low side as well, although they have been sustaining it and it's above average. Their client, Ford and GM doesn't have moat as well so growth may depend on them being able to pitch their new products to global auto companies.

I have no data for London stocks, so no opinion on Standard Chartered bank.

Disclaimers:
I personally invest in high moat and undervalued (at current yield or future growth) companies, so my views may not be applicable to others. Companies spitting money interest me the most. These are just my views from taking a brief look at the companies. I have no vested interest.

t3_9hd1ch,e6bcu7v,"You really need to investigate their cash flow statements to understand what is going on.

\>GM

FY17 cash flow from operations was $17.3bn, but actual capex was only ($8.4bn). So, on a simple CFO - Capex basis FCF was $8.9bn.

However, GM lumps in the activities of their financing division into their investing activities. So you have the net impact of finance receivables transactions of ($6.7bn) and net impact of leased vehicle purchases of ($12.5bn).

So clearly the consolidated financial statements are going to be tricky to navigate because the Company consolidates the results of the automotive business along with the finance business.

The notes to the financial statements specifically break out automotive results. FY17 operating cash flow was $13.9bn just from the automotive business. Then, we take out ($8.4bn) automotive capex and adjust for $0.6bn received as a dividend from the financing business and arrive at automotive free cash flow of $5.2bn.

This works out to about $3.48 FCF per share on the automotive business alone, or about a \~10% FCF yield to the equity. Or maybe a better way to look at it would be $1.97 FCF per share (5.5% yield) since we know $1.51 will be paid as a dividend (4.3% yield).

But what about the total ($19.2bn) impact in the cash flow statement from the financing receivables and lease purchases? These transactions are all financed with debt and the actual activities take place in special purpose entities (SPEs) that are managed by GM Financial. It is important to note (really important) that these SPEs are seperate legal entities and their investors do not have recourse to GM Auto / GM Financial. Likewise, GM Financial has no legal obligation to provide additional financial support to them. So effectively, while it is important to monitor the charge-offs and delinquency patterns of these vehicles, they should not be thought of as ""part"" of the GM you're buying.

We need to adjust GM's balance sheet for these activities. A total $89.4bn liabilities held in GM Financial SPEs are apart of these SPEs, so we can deduct this amount from the total amount of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. This reduces the total amount from $176.3bn to $86.9bn. On a debt basis, this reduces the total amount from $52.8bn to $13.5bn. With $13.3bn of automotive cash (excludes GM Financial cash) we have net debt of $0.2bn (plus an additional $8.3 cash held in securities that I excluded).

So you can see that after adjusting for the way the financing business has been structured, the actual balance sheet of GM is much more appealing.

Lets look at GM Financial now. For FY17 the subsidiary did $1.0bn in pre-tax earnings, or about $0.6bn in earnings at 26% tax rate. That works out to about $0.48 per share for GM Financial.

So, essentially, you're getting $1.97 per share in GM Auto, $0.48 per share in GM Financial, and $1.51 per share as a dividend = $3.96 per share in total value. This works out to an \~11% yield on the equity.

If you think that the Company will keep chugging along fine, then I suppose that is a sufficient margin of safety and I can see why value investors are attracted to it.

Full disclosure: I've never actually analyzed GM in depth and this is all based on a quick glance at their 10-k and some napkin math, so I'm sure I'm incorrect in some analysis.

t3_9hd1ch,e6bfbhd,"This is a topic I've thought a lot about.

I think that unprofitable companies today are where many of the best investment ideas lie.

The reason for this - if you buy an efficiently priced stock, most of the upside is already sucked out of it. Note that efficiently priced stocks aren't perfectly priced, but their prices are in the right ballpark of actual company value.

Any human or machine can easily slap on a earnings multiple or free cash flow multiple to come up with a full valuation, and this removes much of the upside. When you buy at these prices it's hard to generate truly outsized returns. In other words, it's hard to make a lot of money off of companies that are already profitable. It's easy to find what's trading at low multiples, and that's why this type of bargain hunting is much harder these days. Most profitable companies are fairly priced.

Inefficiently priced securities come in many forms, one of which is companies that 'lack a valuation anchor' like earnings. Your question is precisely the reason why the opportunity exists - how do you value something that doesn't make money? Most investors don't know or don't want to take the time to make their own appraisal of what an opaque asset is worth.

This isn't a direct answer to your question, but I believe that unprofitable securities are an interesting pool of inefficiently priced companies to hunt for good opportunities. If you can find the rare unprofitable company that will be profitable LATER, you stand to earn a lot, maybe 5-10x returns, not some measly 20% return from buying a 25x PE stock. Your diligence should be focused on figuring out what the future of the company looks like, not solely analyzing historical financials.

They say you can't catch fish in clear waters because they've already been caught. I think the same is true in the markets today - most of the easy to catch fish have been caught, it's more competitive.

Boutique asset managers don't really go public so they can benefit shareholders, but as a liquidity event for the partners. I'd personally shy away from them unless it was a very event-driven idea and less reliant on market conditions, etc.

With that being said, if you’re looking to land a job on the buyside, you’re going to have to change the way you look at and analyze companies. Some of the stuff you did here was thorough, but a lot of it was either outright wrong or didn’t really add any value. 

The most glaring of which was the proclamation that trip advisor has no moat... which is wildly untrue. The network effect surrounding this business is a massive moat. Trip advisor offers a much better value proposition than any of its competitors, and the amount of historical reviews it has in the bank plus the amount it generates every day are unmatched and would be extremely difficult to replicate. The questions moving forward clearly revolve around monetization here. But a large value proposition and low monetization is not something I would bet against. With that being said, I have no opinion either long or short trip as I haven’t done extensive work on the company. 

I say all this without hurtful intentions. When I was first starting out, I wish I had someone to tell me I was focusing on the wrong things. It took me a long time to realize it on my own. This writeup looks like a lot of the other writeups you see from guys initially starting out in equity analysis that don’t quite get it yet. I think you started to touch on important factors a bit when started talking about monetization, but that should have been a much bigger focus of the writeup. You should have delved deeper into that, and what factors are going to drive monetization. 

Another thing (this is more personal than a widely accepted, even though it should be) is that most people are more obsessed with numbers than they should be. In terms of investment theses, the qualitative aspect is almost always more important than the quantitative aspect... unless you’re employing a Ben Graham style of deep value, in which case there’s nothing wrong with that. But a majority of the time (and some people might pushback on this, but I’ll defend it until the day I die) the quality aspect should be where 95% of time should be spent, and “back of the napkin” valuations are almost always all you really need. This writeup spent hardly any time on quality, and the little time it did spend, it got entirely wrong. You should be spending much much more time on business quality, and how exactly those qualitative factors are going to be moving the important indicators (like monetization per user in trips case) over the long run. 

It’s not surprising to me that this analysis didnt land you a buyside role. I’m actually very surprised it got you a call back.

t3_9piimv,e8865mw,"$TRIP is a terrible long. They do still benefit from MOAT/network effects, but it is eroding. Their problem is that they are in a terrible position in the value-chain, squeezed between two extremely strong ""partners"", Google on the demand side and Booking/Expedia on the supply side. 

First the source of TRIP's MOAT actually stems from Google, as they were able to build a brand through reviews that typically landed on top of Google search page and built organic traffic, perpetuating the network effect. However, Google has over the past few years shifted organic traffic towards paid (so instead of receiving clicks for free, they now need to compete with players with much stronger conversion/monetization in order to drive traffic). In addition, Google has stepped up in their own meta, which is a superior meta product than Trip and more importantly, much better for key advertising partners (BKNG/EXPE). They hate when the $ they spend with TRIP/Trivago ends up in Google auctions, inflating their CPCs. 

Second, TRIP's problem have always been the monetization and in response they tried to push direct booking on their site. This was a terrible strategic move as BKNG/EXPE are \~90% of hotel revenues. Not a good idea to start competing with your giant and concentrated customers. Booking realized lower ROI's across performance marketing was due to Trivago/Tripadvisor, and to mitigate this, they pulled inventory from TRIP/Trivago and increased their ROI requirements. If Trip gets lower CPC's from key customers, they can't spend as much to drive traffic either, leading to lower hotel shopper numbers.

&#x200B;

I think their longer term issue is that travel reviews are getting commoditized and generally lower value for travellers. They struggle enormously with attracting Millennials (will drive the travel market going fwd), as they want more curated content rather than the generic ""top 10"" lists that Trip is good at generating. That is why they have started with the travel feed to attract influencers and therefore millennials - this will fail miserably though.

\- Its typical to examine the risks and potential downside and then explain why they are mitigated.  For instance, although VST is still long generation (i.e. levered to NG prices), it is partially hedged by its retail business.  Although its not a complete or perfect hedge, VST's integrated nature makes it a lot safer than your typical early 2000's IPP.  (the retail business is a jewel- expanding it into the Dynergy PJT territory is a good opportunity).  As to inflation, the retail business can easily pass added costs to consumers and although the generation side's capex costs would increase, NG prices should rise as well in such a case.  Remember that this is not a typical utility- its an IPP.  Also, most of its debt is fixed.  As to renewables and such, they are irrelevant to the investment horizon.  This is not a hold-forever type stock. 

\- You should not the significant insider buying between 2017 and today.  

\- You should provide a valuation range (i.e. target / intrinsic value).  For instance, using the 1Q share count (its been going down through buybacks), the guidance for 2019 FCF is $2,150 or $4.50 per share. That's an over 18% FCF yield @ $22.5.   For a stable retail-diversified IPP with only 2.5x Net Debt/EBITDA, 60% EBITDA-FCF Conversion Rate, and significant revenue visibility, that is outstanding. A more realistic 10% FCF Yield would result in an approx $41 price (again, assuming no buybacks). 

Another comparable is the fact that Calpine was taken public at 9.2x EV/EBITDA and NRG has been trading between 8 and 10x EV/EBITDA.

For VST, using the midpoint of management's net debt projections and EBITDA guidance (and assuming no buybacks), it currently trades in the 6-6.5x2019 EV/EBITDA range.  If you give it multiple of 8 -10 then the price per share becomes $35 - 48.  That is a super rough back of the envelope type calculation.

\- Definitely have a view on the NG market before going into this. You don't have to think that it is going to go to the moon. Just be confident that it won't crash and burn. 

&#x200B;

Some notes about your catalysts

\- I agree with you about the shareholder rotation being an overhang.  CEO Curtis Morgan did a podcast not that long ago (linked at their investor relations page) and noted the same.  The big distressed debt boys (Oaktree, Apollo, and Brookfield) are gradually cashing out after huge gains.  The removal of that overhang would be a big catalyst.

\- I don't agree as to Investment Grade in 2019.  It's super hard for an IPP to obtain an investment grade to begin with.  Add to that the fact that (new) VST has a short track record and recently assumed the Dynergy debt. If you read the latest credit agency reports on VST, they are in wait and see mode to see how VST digests the Dynergy acquisition.  Super low odds of that happening in 2019. 

\- I think the most basic of catalysts is the continuing pay down of debt. Deleveraging is accretive to equity. 

\- Further stock buybacks are an upside option.  I think the stock is genuinely undervalued and if there is left over cash after growth projects, I would love for further buybacks. 

\- I dont like dividends. Not tax efficient at all. Would much rather have buybacks or further debt paydown at this point if there are no attractive growth investments available.  That said, you are correct in listing it as a catalyst as it would gain inclusion into a bunch of dividend ETF's and attract the retiree/DGI crowd.

- Value from acquisitions, assuming no synergies, could be related to basically how disciplined a firm is with making acquisitions (Does $1 in M&A create $2 in value, or is it neutral/negative?). This requires a judgement on how good they are at making good offers and then determining whether you're willing to ""pay up"" for that future benefit. It's not something I'll usually pay up for.

- A historical example, in my opinion, of someone good at this is Henry Singleton with Teledyne. He was a master at this. He often held stock (through his company) in firms that he liked and at prices that he liked, because he couldn't buy the whole thing at that price.

An extreme and exaggerated example of this is if you owned five foot of conduit that you have a monopoly on that connects the entire united states oil supply to a refiner, the cost to replace that pipe is, in essence like $1000 including labor.  Now, if you calculate the cashflow of that asset, you will get what the current rate is, but taking out political risk, the future DCF model you are more dependent on how much you want to hike prices vs. a supply and demand constrained model.

So, value is really in the hands of who is making the valuation and the time frame the individual is assigning to the cash flows.

Problem with all valuations is that the valuation does not exist in a vaccuum without macro events.  A credit crisis in China or the US saying that Chinese buyers are no longer able to invest in a certain asset class will take buyers out of the market, reducing demand for a stock or equity.

&#x200B;

*Will the FED raise interest rates in December?*

Yes.  Too telegraphed and locked in not to, but next year is more of a crap shoot given recent FOMC quasi-dovishness.

&#x200B;

*Is housing data an important leading indicator?*

Yes, especially orders but it is still unclear whether the current order slowdown is due to a rate bump or other factors.  Formations and overall starts still way below long term trends.  A bump in the cancellation rate along with an order slowdown will signal bad things.  I don't think that will happen though.

&#x200B;

*Which companies do you think have important quarterly results coming up?*

GE as they're just such a big debt issuer and we'll get an update on the long term care debacle.   It is still incredible to me that the Kansas Dept of Insurance waived statutory accounting rules so GE could stair-step its $15B reserve bump.  Why would a known major financial liability NOT appear on a balance sheet??!!?!  Another thing nobody talks about....the big pension hole they have (\~$30 billion).  Where the heck is that money going to come from as they have boomers retiring and being laid off?

&#x200B;

*Which secular trend do you believe is at an inflection point?*

Quite a few...loosening debt covenants, absence of inflation/wage growth, low-forever corporate spreads...

&#x200B;

*Do you think that M&A is going to increase or decrease in the near future?*

Decrease since debt costs are higher

&#x200B;

*New accounting or tax rules you think are interesting?*

There's a silly rule this year that puts equity unrealized gains and losses through net income instead of comprehensive for some companies.  Why?  And why not also include debt unrealized G/L?  This just makes it harder to analyze financials and has no clear purpose.

&#x200B;

*And any other interesting trends, data, or analysis you'd like to share*

QE tapering (or ""QT) is a major theme.  U.S. well into it, Europe beginning it and trailing US by 2-3 yrs, and Japan needs to fix its upside down population stack with immigration before anything can be done there.

&#x200B;

(2) People jump to the conclusion that these businesses are going to get slammed in a downturn, which makes it pretty clear they have done about zero real work. The alts that were actually traded in 2007 were BAM, BX, and PGHN. BAM and PGHN were down about the same as the S&P. BX was down more, but I would argue that was because they IPOd at such a crazy valuation, which really should be seen as yet another a good capital allocation decision by management. In addition, BX as you mentioned was an is a PTP, so there were less buyers to catch the fall. 

&#x200B;

(3) People also don't appreciate how fees on a private equity fund work. If a typical PE fund runs 15 years for full liquidy, the first 5 years or investment period you pay a fee on your full commitment (whether its invested or not), and once you pass the investment period, either by lapse of time or by raising a second fund, then you enter the harvest phase where you pay a lower fee on the cost basis of the capital invested. In other words, you don't pay fees on marks. The funds could go up 50%, down 20%, down 80%... whatever it wants... you still pay fees on the cost basis of invested capital which only goes down when (1) assets are sold and realized, which naturally takes longer in a recession so you get even more time to earn fees, or (2) when an investment goes bankrupt and they realize a zero.  

&#x200B;

(4) Many of these businesses have a huge amount of dry powder, people don't seem to understand that if the economy tanks... PE funds are going to put that record amount of dr powder to work. And because they would be putting the money to work in a crisis, 5-7 years from now its going to result in major performance fees.

(5) Many of these PE funds are building pools of permanent capital. KKR has nearly $42Bn in permanent capital that they earn a management fee and performance fee on. I know of zero businesses, other than some of these alts, that have a 30+ year line of sight into their revenue.

#### Description

**Intro**

We are long shares of Electronic Arts (EA), one of the world’s premier video game publishers with highly successful franchises such as FIFA, Madden, Battlefield and Star Wars. EA’s sports franchise (FIFA, Madden, NBA Live, NHL) accounts for nearly half of revenue and provides an annuity-like recurring revenue stream as titles are released annually (with a long history going back more than twenty years). EA further increases the value of the IP with its Live Services portfolio that drives deeper engagement and monetization. Features such as Ultimate Team, where gamers can build their own teams to compete against each other (similar to fantasy sports), has been a significant driver of monetization well beyond the upfront purchase. Live Services now accounts for 43% of bookings and continues to grow. EA also benefits from a secular shift towards digitally downloaded games (\~80% gross margin) from packaged games sold in retail stores (\~60% gross margin) and this trend has resulted in significant margin expansion.

EA shares are down nearly 40% since July due to: (1) the delayed release of Battlefield V; (2) two consecutive quarters of lower than expected live services growth; and (3) concerns regarding the competitive environment amid Fortnite’s popularity and successful launches by Activision (Call of Duty: Black Ops 4) and Take-Two (Red Redemption 2 aka RDR2). Despite early positive indications from a public alpha test, EA decided to delay the launch of Battlefield V by one month from October 19 to November 20. Management decided to delay the release because the original launch date fell right in between the launches of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (October 12) and RDR2 (October 26). This decision was also made when the popularity of Fortnite seemed to be at an all-time high so EA was probably rightfully concerned. However, Fortnite did not seem to have an impact on the launches of Black Ops 4 and RDR2. Activision set a launch day record as the biggest day one digital release in its history with Black Ops 4, and Take-Two’s RDR2 sold more than $725 million during its first three days. Nevertheless, sell-side expectations for Battlefield V have come down significantly with unit sales projected to come down from 15 million units to 10-11 million. 10-11 million units would be dramatically lower than the 16 million units EA sold of the last Battlefield title, Battlefield 1, released two years ago. While the competitive dynamics are less favorable today for Battlefield V, this is well reflected in the current stock price. Given the release will occur right around Black Friday, sentiment on EA could rapidly improve if unit sales come in even a little better than expected.

EA lowered guidance for FY2019 (EA’s fiscal year ends on March 31) bookings from $5.55 billion to $5.20 billion and FCF from $1.7 billion to $1.525 billion as EA now expects some unit sales of Battlefield V to be pushed out into FY2020. At $1.525 billion of FCF, EA trades at just 16.8x FCF. On a forward basis on consensus estimates (FY2020), EA trades at just 15.8x FCF, significantly lower than TTWO (24x FY2020) and ATVI (21x CY2019). At these levels, the stock is very attractive.

**Digital Penetration Driving Margin Expansion**

EA benefits from two key secular trends in the video game industry: game sales transitioning from physical to digital and increase of in-game spending. Today, \~42% of EA’s unit sales are digital, vs. 36% last year, and management expects an underlying shift of around 5% a year to digital downloads. This is the early to middle innings for this transition. Improving broadband infrastructure that continues to offer faster options for consumers and large storage options on consoles will continue to drive this trend. Gross margins are significantly higher for digital downloads (80% for digital and 60% for physical) and EA has seen major gross margin expansion over the last few years (see chart below).

The other significant digital driver has been the increase of Live Services (in-game purchases and subscriptions). EA has been very successful in increasing in-game engagement and driving monetization, especially for key titles such as FIFA. Ultimate Team, which allows players to build their own teams by purchasing player cards to compete against other players, accounts for more than 50% of Live Services. Some sell-side estimates indicate that nearly 80% of FIFA players play Ultimate Team and nearly a quarter of them make a purchase.

While growth expectations from Live Services in FY2019 has been lowered (general expectations are around flat to 5% growth) as EA delayed the release of Battlefield V and player engagement in the World Cup mode has impacted FIFA Ultimate Team, Live Services will continue to grow as EA continues to find ways to increase engagement (especially in FIFA and other titles like Battlefield V that will have a battle royale mode for the first time ever) and introduce new subscriptions like Premier Access Premier that offers unlimited access to latest PC titles for $15/month or $100/year.

Overall, bookings from digital have grown from 45% in FY2014 to nearly 70% today, driving gross margins from 62% to 77% and FCF margins from 15% to 30%. As digital penetration continues to grow, the margin profile should continue to improve.

**Extremely Valuable Franchises**

Revenue from EA’s sports portfolio (FIFA, Madden, NHL and NBA Live) has become annuity-like with new titles being released every year, resulting in a recurring and generally predictable revenue stream. And as previously discussed, increased engagement from Live Services further enhances the value of these key titles. Also, the FIFA franchise should continue to increase in value along with the growing popularity of soccer around the world. Soccer remains the world’s most popular sport (according to Nielsen survey below).

📷

In the recent World Cup, global viewership increased vs. the 2014 World Cup, despite a severe drop in ratings in countries like the U.S. (since the U.S. did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup). Popularity of the sport is growing in critical markets like China, where Nielsen saw interest increasing from 27% in 2013 to 32% in 2017. Soccer’s growing popularity in markets like China, the world’s largest gaming market, will be important for EA’s growth story going forward as Chinese gamers play on their phone or PC (console market is very small). More than 70% of EA’s bookings come from console.

Outside of sports, EA’s key brands are Battlefield, Star Wars and Need for Speed. Battlefield is EA’s second largest franchise and typically sells 14-17 million units in a release year. As mentioned previously, EA’s stock decline is due to lowered expectations that Battlefield V will sell 10-11 million units vs. previous expectations of 15-16 million. Given the popularity and long history (first title was released in 2002) of this brand, we think there could be tremendous upside if this title sells even slightly better than expectations. EA plans to introduce new features for Battlefield V like a Battle Royale mode, the first time ever for a Battlefield release, and this will help drive engagement and popularity for this franchise.

In February of next year, EA is introducing Anthem, a brand new IP that combines 3rd person shooter and action role-playing game elements in an open world. Management previously alluded to expectations that Anthem would probably sell about 3-4 million units but recently raised that to 6 million or more based on indications of gamers’ interests. If Anthem turns out to be a hit, that could provide upside to the stock as expectations for the title are still fairly low (sell-side models range anywhere from 4 to 6 million units).

t3_a8zxex,ecfwckr,"Although some of these are quality names that track a secular growing trend, I wouldn't touch them until they get particularly cheap. The issue with gaming stocks is that although their biz models have evolved over the last ~2x decades to be less hit-based and more towards predictability/franchises, their revenues are still lumpy and visibility is typically limited. ""Franchise fatigue"" is real but notoriously hard to track.  Growing leisure trend, high margin levels, and margin expansion are likely make up for that, but still. Also, another issue in some of these names is execution. For example, EA has some really good franchises but god, they are dubbed one of the most hated companies. And Nintendo owns some best IPs out there but probably needs Bobby Kotick to run their go-to-market strategies imo.. 

Since you have been following this industry, how do you think about their edges and pricing power? what do you use to track game success over time?

1. How stable is the business? The more stable the higher the leverage ratio can safely go.

3. Distribution of maturities vs. FCF. In an ideal situation each year the company could use its FCF to pay all debt coming due that year if the capital markets shut down or are in a very pessimistic state

""Last year once again demonstrated that markets can be confoundingly fickle. Well- known conditions and widely anticipated events, such as Federal Reserve rate hikes, ongoing trade disputes, and the unsettling behavior of an erratic president, were shrugged off by the financial markets one day and driving markets down the next. Is there a cumulative impact, where no one thing matters until the collective weight of them starts to? Is the market simply myopic, whereby it ignores signs of trouble until they become more immediate and it can ignore them no longer? It’s always hard to know why the market does what it does. That’s part of the ever-interesting challenge we face in traversing the twists and turns of fluctuating prices and evolving fundamentals. On any given day, the sheer number of players, behaviors, economic factors, and business developments defy anyone’s ability to fully grasp what is going on and why. That’s why we develop and follow a game plan that does not purport to tell us what to do moment by moment, but rather is intended to help us successfully navigate the most challenging tumult. This is the essence of value investing.""",5,1548280334,[],,,

I think with these types of reports, any feedback will necessarily be superficial due to the asymmetry.  I spent five minutes reading your post, while you may have spent X hours not only learning the company but also forming your thoughts.

Having said that, I think it's evident you put in the work on the name and accurately described the moving parts.  Considering the length of the report, I think the writeup is as comprehensive and lucid as it can be.

For some insight, I'm a software developer and the more managed products have higher switching costs - and the industry is growing towards more managed cloud offerings. It's no longer about hosting the same codebase or a common DB on a number of computers on google cloud or AWS.

AWS has very good products that don't exist with other providers. Certain AWS-only products require specific languages their customers must write code in. It becomes very difficult to switch cloud providers once you have developed your stack for a specific provider.

Since AWS products pair easily with other AWS products (and price point is usually one of the best), companies tend to get more and more ""tangled"" in AWS products the longer they are a customer. I'm sure it is similar in other provider ecosystems.

Warren Buffett talked specifically about this, about the moat in hybrid cloud services (or cloud with added value), in an interview in squawk box when discussing his IBM investment. That was only maybe about a year ago. As you know, he then went on and sold his whole position.

I don't know if he changed his mind about the cloud business or about IBM's execution but he held onto it for a few years, which is a long time to meditate about the economics of a business, so I'm going to go with that he didn't like IBM's execution. But, again, I cannot be sure what he was thinking. Maybe the moat is not so deep after all.

Building a cloud is extremely complex problem and constrains of IT infrastructure are counter intuitive. Only top people capable of simplifying the systems can do. Average performers build up complexity without control making costs per server orders of magnitude higher than top players.

I encountered 2 examples recently:

**1) Deutsche Börse Cloud Exchange.** Deutsche Börse stock exchange made an effort to create a public marketplace for cloud resources: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche\_B%C3%B6rse\_Cloud\_Exchange\_AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_B%C3%B6rse_Cloud_Exchange_AG)The project failed, and the reason is not lack of capital. They discovered that nobody except of Amazon can run a cloud service with acceptable quality.

**2) Azure Germany.** Major German companies don't trust American service providers, because of some subtle legal reasons. But they need cloud. Microsoft started project ""Azure Germany"" ([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/germany/?cdn=disable](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/germany/?cdn=disable)) , which is a copy of Azure infrastructure maintained by a German company without access of Microsoft's employees to the system. They failed and closed registration of new users with plans to shutdown the service, and not because of lack of demand. There were cases when customer support often answered ""I am sorry, we can't help, but we can involve an expert from Microsoft, would it work for you?"". What could be easier than running existing system which works well for Microsoft?

I would criticize two main things: 1) your model is difficult to follow, and 2) your forecast is quite rudimentary.

Starting with 1, a lot of easy-to-read models have key lines bolded or highlighted to bring attention to them (such as EBITDA, or EBIT), and the math is separated with lines (just as you would use when doing 15-10 in a fractional layout). 

And for 2, In order for me to find a model useful, I would want some granularity as to how the revenue forecast is being justified. Right now you are just growing each segment by a growth rate, which is fine if all they give you is the revenue by segment (I haven't looked at MSFT), but you want to indicate some kind of justification. Why is the top line going to grow at 5% per year if the industry is only growing at 2%? Are they taking share? Why? You also want to have the growth rates separate from the cells, and do the math in the cell. So have the growth forecasted as a % in a cell (i.e. x segment growing by 10%, 9%, 8%, etc.) and then in the actual dollar cell do the math of previous year * (1+growth rate of current year). 

I can send you an example of a model I have done with three full statements linked together. I'm not saying I am the model god but I think it would be useful if you're interested in improving your modelling (anyone else who is interested in just PM me).

Keep learning though, its a long journey but very rewarding and fun.

t3_ah1l4v,eed0e4b,"You're on the right track, but as other have said, the model is very difficult to follow. Also, I see #REFs all over the model page as well as the other beginning pages. You don't need to show all the business overview, and acquistions within excel tabs. This would all go within a pitchbook, not a model. You need to color code so people can understand where certain numbers are coming from. (Blue for hardcode inputs, Green for cell references, black for formulas). 

As for the operating margin and some of the other line items, I don't see the rationale behind ""why"" you believe these margins are going to increase to 33% and stay constant. 

The pro-formas are also essentially non-existent. You should have seperate pages for Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, Debt/Interest Expense, WACC caluclation, comps sheet (if applicable), Working Capital sheet, and a fixed asset schedule. This helps you link the statements together, and get a better picture of the overall operating model. Without that, the DCF is just garbage in and garbage out. The numbers become meaningless when they're not rooted in logic and rationale. 

Also, where are you getting a discount rate of 4% from? Last time I checked on Bloomberg, MSFT's WACC was around 8.5%. This will impact your model TREMENDOUSLY. 

Also there is no line item called ""Actual Net Income"". Net income flows to the balance sheet, to the retained earnings account after you deduct dividends. 

I would definitely check out some guides on wallstreetoasis, or many other finance related forums for templates on models. I would also make sure you understand financial accounting well, since it will drive your forecasts. 

Lastly, don't attempt to model out a company for this many years. It's pointless, and nobody can accurately predict the future that far out. Aim for 5-7 years, especially with a mature company that has positive FCF.

&#x200B;

Some things I don't like, though. Adding the quarterly 2018 revenues makes it hard to read. You can do some annualisation in another section of your model if you feel this is important, but for the main section I would say keep it simple here with only annual numbers. Using some cell borders is definitely useful and will clean up the look of the model a little bit, making it easier to read.

Also, as other people have noted, colour coding will improve this model by 50% straight off the bat. As I said before, your thesis is fine - you have decided what you are driving your model on based on what you know. However, if you made hard coded values blue and formulas black, it makes it easy to spot where your assumption drivers are, and where your derived values are. This makes the model much easier to read and use, and can be done relatively quickly.

2. A common formula is finance for a company's sustainable growth rate is ROE \* the retention ratio, which is essentially the growth in book value. Retention ratio = 1-dividend payout ratio = the amount of earnings that are retained in the company rather than paid out = the growth in book value.

But lets assume every DTC dollar raised by VC ever was thrown into FB/GOOG, so what? That is a very small % of the absolute dollar growth of FB/GOOG.

Reality in my opinion is advertising is cyclical, every up cycle when we start to see froth, we will see it be spent like this, and vice versa, but I don't think this really holds water over the long run. Many of the established CPG brands are spending increasingly larger and larger % of spend on advertising. 

And whats the alternative? Assume online advertising is a bubble, but it seems that in aggregate we are still spending advertising pretty consistent spend % of gdp. Do we go back to TV?

NFLX isn't like 'old media' as they are able to control the end customer relationship and collect all the data, enabling self-optimization, etc. These attributes are also really important for international expansion. Netflix also has greater branding and has become somewhat synonymous with streaming (nflx and chill was big).

However I think we'll get a pretty great case study on structural barriers to entry with NFLX and likely find few.

AT&T and Disney both spent \~$70-80B to cement themselves as the largest media companies in the world and will release NFLX competitor products in 4Q19. AMZN is a serious competitor, as is Hulu. AAPL will likely soon announce their own service. CMCSA just announced theirs for 1H20. Google will likely converge YouTube TV and a premium YouTube to create a new TV product.

At that point two things will happen: (1) nflx will face serious competition on subscriber adds with likely increased churn and (2) 'old media' will either begin to charge a lot more for the licensed content on netflix (\~80+% content viewed on Netflix is licensed to Netflix and this market is already heating up, see $100M for non-exclusive agreement with Warner for Friends) or remove it entirely for their own streaming apps.

NFLX naturally needs to invest in original content to stave off competitors, which is difficult given current cap structure and competition they're facing (best capitalized companies of all time). Their competitors will also bundle in products from their core offerings as well as include live-native entertainment (ex. AMZN prime video may have exclusive sports rights soon), which NFLX likely can't compete on. Media has historically been a pretty shit business, with the few really durable successes coming from selling in alongside products with true barriers to entry - ex. cable

Aside from content itself, as consumers shift off the legacy pay-TV ecosystem and onto streaming platforms (this is huge and accelerating, see T's most recent earnings results), NFLX could potentially lose their relationship with end consumers (and their data) as people would potentially pay on the GOOG/AMZN/ROKU/AAPL/CMCSA's streaming platform for their laundry list of streaming subscriptions.

t3_anv94j,efwj43w,"A couple of things. The MOAT comes from scale. When you have a large audience as Netflix does (they current own 50% of global VOD industry ) your content catalog has to be super huge to meet the varied needs of your customers, otherwise your customers will go elsewhere. Not many companies can spend US$8Bn a year to generate that content.  As they scale the cost per customer of the content will decline. This means that any new entrant would have to burn cash for several years before their average cost approaches any where near Netflix's. Netflix also owns it content which gives them enormous leverage. The ownership of that content allows them avoid massive competition for the few movies studios that are out there. Plus customer acquisition is very difficult and expensive, customers don't just get up and handover their credit cards you have to work hard for that. Given the difficulties outlined that market may become a 3 player game. Amazon, Netflix, Disney all of who will own their content.

They are becoming a studio more and more, without the vertical integration of studios like Disney.

Netflix is taking out serious debt in order to create a content library to rival the bigger studios before all 3rd party content is pulled from their platform. It is not a business I have a desire in owning as it feels capital intensive without long term gains ( as you mentioned regarding low IMDB scores).

Hulu is quite clunky, CBS All Access can’t even do the basic functions well, HBO Go is not at neatly laid out as Netflix.

t3_ao6b2a,efyjhvf,"General thoughts. 

1. your decline rates are a function of primarily the age of the existing production, the rate of new drilling activity, the geological features, and the style in which you are extracting it (vertical vs horizontal wells, number of fracs, waterfloods, carbon floods, etc). I suspect your numbers are too low as a gut feel and will point out that gas and oil are often produced from the same well - it's called associated gas. So you need to understand what kind of liquids they are producing from their gas wells and the general 'type curves' that are used as a benchmark for the areas they are exploring (basically, it's a big data hunt but the company should share some of this in their presentations). Decline rate = (ending production - production added (you will need to assume this) - opening production) / opening production
2. Dont forget about costs of production royalties, taxes, transport, and overhead.  Whats critical here is your realized prices versus the appropriate pricing benchmark.  The company should indicate what they view as their best comparable. Your DCF can be done using a 'steady state' capex or one where they just stop spending on growth and blow down reserves - this can give you bookends on where your valuation could be. Its messy but thats half the fun. 
3. 1P is only proven reserves.  Some counties' royalty/tax environment deter companies from booking a lot of reserves, while others don't - this will play a big role in knowing whether this number is optimistic or conservative.  Also note that 1P = proven producing (no more capex required) + proven undeveloped (PUDs) <= which is stuff they are still guessing on.  Check the concentration of PUDs to see how overbooked they might be. 2P includes step out locations and other reserves that may come but, similar to PUDs, they will need to spend more money to extract them. Depending on how early stage the resource is, you may need to look to 3P reserves to see where the potential is.  In short: I think NAV generally stinks but that's maybe just me. Reserves are very polluted with assumptions, the most important of which is the prevailing oil price which can be miles away from reality, especially further in the future. 
4. Yes. I use reserves as a way to assess the real cash costs of finding, developing, and extracting to support the rest of my math
5. US companies show this in their 10K, Canadian companies in their AIF.  These two reserve calcs also differ in their prices that they can use to calculate future reserves.

It’s showing that it will pay out 10% annually in dividends, which means you would need to hold it for 10 years to make all of your money back through dividends. It’s probably not going to zero any time soon and may get acquired at some point by a larger company. 

One of the reasons why Buffett and Graham were so successful with their cigar butt companies is because they could buy enough of the company to “unlock” the value. This usually meant there was some major mispricing in the stock price due to a large amount of cash or investments or something along those lines. However, management was unwilling to pay out these assets to shareholders. Buffett and Graham would buy a controlling stake in the company and then force management to pay out their investors. This lead them to turning a nice profit rather quickly. 

So I guess what I’m trying to say here is that it COULD be a cigar butt company, but you’re reliant on management to act in the best interest of investors. Which is never a guarantee.

/u/boastarr is right that a big reason why Buffett got involved in net-nets was because he could buy enough shares to make a change in the business which is hard for individual investors to do. 

A less appreciated aspect of Buffett's net-net days is that he frequently was buying shares of *good* companies that just happened to be trading at these attractive prices. Companies that were growing their net income and revenues, not really companies facing secular decline and liquidity problems. The reason he was able to do this was just the way information was scarce back in the 50s and 60s and he could find these companies in moody's manuals, etc. 

Its hard these days to find quality companies trading at net-net values. You have to either look for some balance sheet complexity that hides the real NAV, or go out of the US to like south korea where there actually are good companies trading at these values. The language barrier will be a problem though.

Global penetration may be a little tricker to predict, but seems to be growing quite rapidy at 40% year over year in 2017 and 2018 so you could probably assume similar growth in the short term and then start reducing over time. 

You could then model out both US and global paid memberships. For the US  growing at mabye 8%-10% year over year and tapering down and for global around 20%-30% initialy and tapering down over time. 

Both US and global ARPU has grown around 10% year over year for 2017 and 2018, so conservativly you could probably grow it out in a model at around 3%-5%.

You can then multiply the US and global ARPU by the number of paid memberships to get total streaming revenue. You may also want to incldue non-streaming revenue (DVD) dropping over time.

It is unlikely that your return capital will continue to exceed your cost of capital forever.  Damodaran goes into this in his book ""The Dark Side of Valuation"".  He goes on to say that it is equally unlikely that a company that is has a higher return on its capital than its cost of capital is unlikely to have the two magically equal each other in the terminal period.

The compromise he offers is to have the terminal return on capital to be 3-5% greater than your WACC.  This will capture the trend of the return on capital slowly meeting your cost of capital sometime in that perpetual period.

Also, there has been a bit of academic work in the relationship between returns, reinvestment, and growth rate during the past decade or so.  This work has to do with incorporating inflation into this dynamic. Inflation in this relationship is something that Damodaran ignores.

The initial work was done by a Bradley and Jarrell, but they have fucked up views on working capital in the terminal period.

You're really thinking of it backwards. Informally, beta represents how much the stock moves in relation to the market (not the other way around -- generally that will be negligible except for the most significant companies). 

The specific measure beta involves both the correlation between the stock and the market and the volatility of the stock. Both of these are very relevant for the purposes of evaluating risk adjusted returns.

>  but for someone who doesn't care about market fluctuations do you think using beta makes sense?

In some sense, the idea of using beta is to remove all ""market fluctuations"" from your analysis and focus on alpha. The whole idea is to answer the question ""If the market does not move at all, what kind of returns can I expect from this asset?""

So if you can earn 5% in risk free assets, you sure as hell are going to need at least a 5% return in equities, regardless of the individual risk profile of the asset. 

Then the equation says in addition to the risk free rate, you should earn the average market risk premium (average benchmark return less risk free rate), but at a multiple of the individual asset’s risk. If that multiple, aka beta, is 1, then you’re assuming one should be earning the risk free rate + the market risk premium. If beta is 2, then risk free rate plus 2X market risk premium.

t3_aylz79,ei1v1yi,"I cover the gaming sector for work, I’ll try to add some nuance to what is going on with the share prices. 

So 2018 TV studios start to crack and go to shit because of Netflix so Long-only investors start looking for something in media to replace it. Enter Video Game stocks. Increasingly recurring revenue, 3 major companies, secular growing user base, strong financials, MTX, nice big fat slate of games for the fall, maybe the strongest in 10 years. Well, Fortnite came in and basically fucked that all up. 

1) Took a massive amount of usage time away from ALL games, including more ‘insulated’ franchises like FIFA and 2K leading to Live Services growth to crack for EA in 2H. ATVI saw a decline vs. WW2 which was a new COD franchise vs. Black Ops which is arguably their strongest sub franchise. 

2) Broke the business model. The thesis was that the franchises these companies held had durable value. Fortnite showed that they are pretty vulnerable. Now there is some argument about what is durable and what is not. The shooting genre in general seems to be at risk - I really think ATVI will have a hard time selling units at $60 when you can play Fortnite and Apex Legends - two great games for free. Sports games are likely the most durable due to 1) moat around the rights to produce the games 2) separate cohort of players vs. Shooters 3) Ultimate Team / MyTeam have very active and dedicated bases. So now you have a situation where not only do you have way less certainty that your development costs are going to be recouped, but you have to OVER spend on development so it doesn’t come out and fucking flop, AND you have to give it away for free. 

3) At the end of the day, this is a usage driven business. Attention = dollars assuming monetization doesn’t push what is acceptable by the community (decent odds are getting perceived valuable loot, and NEVER IMPLEMENTING PAY TO WIN). Fortnite sapped the attention away from everyone. This is why Netflix said they view Fortnite as a big competitor on their last earnings call. 

So now, instead of this annuity stream of $60 units + MTX gravy from durable franchise narrative you have this free-to-play hit driven all-or-nothing thesis where someone is going to win and someone is going to lose, ESPECIALLY in the shooter genre. Look at BLOPS 4 (dead, #5 in Superdata rankings, lasted a month), Anthem - dead, Fallout 76 - dead. Unfortunately, investors are just not going to pay 29x+ like they were at peak again because these are heavily uncertain and lumpy businesses. 

In terms of ranking them I think it is pretty easy. 

1) EA - Apex is hit, 50m+ players, completely not in estimates. FIFA is THE most durable franchise across the entire gaming space. However, monetization may be maturing. I think of EA as paying 15x FIFA earnings = ~$80 and paying for optionality on subscription, eSports and Apex. I’m good with that. $130 - I think Apex adds 500m+ this year. 

2) ATVI - at least they took their medicine and restructured but I just don’t trust the execution right now. I think they are going to sell their soul to the devil with mobile offerings in China thinking they are going to hit a jackpot and completely ruin their brand here in the US. I think COD is now in decline, you likely see a free BR out of them this year (MW4 & MW2 remaster might be able to eek out another year of units). Upside rides on Diablo. Overwatch is fucked because it got wayyyy too competitive and scared away the casual gamer (which is 85% of the base), Candy Crush is haemorrhaging players (but in hindsight was a great acq), eSports will be immaterial. Downside STILL to estimates. 20x $2 is $40, and I think that is pretty fair. 

3) TTWO - the street still loves this name and I can’t for the life of me figure out how people do not seeing the writing on the wall. Red Dead just does not have the ‘sex’ appeal of manipulating and playing within a city. Analysts have basically just taken the # of units from GTA, the same monetization, slapped it on Red Dead. It’s not going to happen. Monetization has already fallen off a cliff (7th highest grossing revenue game in Dec, two months after launch) and didn’t budge with multiplayer release. And worst part is, there is nothing else coming. 2K? Priced in. There is nothing but downside here.

**TDG**

Acquire sole-source provider A&D products, jack up the margins. Talk to incumbents - they literally are at TDG's mercy when it comes to parts. The business started in the 1990's from ~20m revenue. The business model works (although walks a fine line re: ethics IMO)

**ROL**

Pest control rollup. Call your mom and ask which company provides her pest control services. Then ask which company it was last year. Recurring revenue, incremental margins, consistent sales growth, and these guys have an amazing track record of modest projections/beating earnings (pull the data in, it's incredible).

Less-so a ""roll-up"" and moreso an organic investment-oriented ""high returns on incremental capital"" situation. Fiber internet... CEO has a great record of capital allocation/good communications with shareholders (IMO). Another one in the early stages... Check some writeups on VIC.


&nbsp;


**CMPR**

Rollup of ""mass customization"" companies, their largest being vistaprint. Think anything from customized mugs, business cards, to mouse pads. I'm honestly a bit skeptical of their business model, but I trust that the stock will at least outperform S&P due to sound capital allocation. The CEO puts out great annual letters on their capital allocation practices. They also *do not* manage earnings at all, the number jumps around while revenues, marketing/R&D  budget grows. Stock is depressed right now... personally a large holding of mine. If you're interested google for the CEO's annual letters.

And more is expected to in 2018. This means the uranium producers finally threw the towel in and began shutting projects down.

This won't affect revenue. Maybe it's a bit aggressive, but frankly GAAP financials would be more accurate to the economics of the business if you matched certain up front sales costs to the life of the customer. I know what they're doing is a bit different, but it's a similar principal.

Meh. They're paid on adjusted EBITDA excluding litigation because their bonuses should be based on how the core business is doing not if they are sued because of past behavior.

It's always possible that the board recommends the deal, and the shareholders shoot it down. I also doubt Reliance Infra has any interest in receiving EBIX shares as payment (a further \~7% shareholder). Also the board will remember selling the business for $10 a share just 2.5 years ago, and Sanjay Arora (a board member) was the one that paid $10 a share via his firm Terrapin... so hard for me to think they won't push back hard on $7 a share or outright reject that price (the business has grown top line \~70% since 2016 as well).

-  It looks like there is a wide range of valuation for this company and there might be some value in this junk asset. I see people valued SMTA based on rents and cap rate. I think, however, when you factor in operating costs (which is likely more expensive since they operate as a stand-alone entity and thus proforma numbers might overstate their profit metrics - seen in their pro-forma Form 10), then it doesn’t look as much attractive on NOI basis or FFO basis. Peers trade at 15x P/FFO but SMTA has way more debts, and much of their FFO come from impairment. It’s difficult to see their real earnings power and market values of their assets as they use cost basis for presentation.

- Shopko likely file for bankruptcy due to poor operating results and a lack of buyers' interest. While there’s some value even in the bankruptcy case, there will be lost rent and drop in the real estate values, which might lead to further impairment. This might keep it longer for market sentiment to change (while interest rate increases), and it might end up like CLNS situation.

- SMTA is externally managed. I’m not saying that all externally managed models do not work. It’s just hard for me to see how this model works due agency problem, no skin in the game… etc. Examples: SRC, CLNS.. ",2,1553869831,[],,,

&nbsp;


**Pros**

1) Ethan Brown seems like a great leader/jockey

2) Large TAM - fast growing market, the trends are in your favor

3) Not only is BYND a forerunner (along with Impossible) but it appears they are outpacing other competitors - widening the gap. I've done some scuttlebutt, tried their products, visited stores, talked to employees and these things fly off the shelves. 


&nbsp;


**Questions**

1) **Supply Chain:** Can they lower the price point of vegan meats? Do they have scale in their production? What will their profitability look like versus traditional meat producers?

2) Is this an industry where you get a second-mover advantage? I.e. BYND blows tons of money on R&D/advertising enabling the tech and consumers to embrace it, lowering gateway for competition.

3) I thought management's/board's salary seemed a bit high considering current size of company. I like to see mgmt with skin in the game.

I’m no where near a vegan. I eat chicken relentlessly and LOVE a greasy cheeseburger, so this isn’t me being a kicking wing from joe dirt only selling snakes and sparklers cuz that’s all I like. 

More and more people are becoming vegan. For all types of reasons. Environmental, ethical, or health. This won’t decrease. Especially with options like this becoming more popular. 20 years ago vegan was hard because you’d have no options and have to eat a pound of soybeans to get protein. Now you can have a tasty meal that’s more nourishing than traditional food. 

Another thing, is that how healthy these foods are compared to regular meat. I’m eating more of these products as I’m health conscious and the nutrition is hard to beat in terms of protein/calories/fat. I love me some cheeseburgers. But I also love being in shape and not obese. These foods make that much easier. For health minded individuals you can’t beat it. 

There’s also so much political pressure to “outlaw” meat. While that won’t happen outright, I envision something like gasoline in Europe. Whereas they hate gasoline so much they’ve taxed the crap out of it to make it so costly to discourage the use. The same thing for meat could be less than 10 years away.

I think this is a solid play. Almost certainly a solid long term play as they are positioned to be the first mover. Thats not always a good thing but food and supermarkets are tough. They already have been around enough to be known by retailers, employees and consumers. There is plenty buzz, and although many have mentioned they're not making money they are having a very hard time keeping up with demand. 

This capital raise is most certainly to scale production and reduce their COGS. The fact of the matter is that they establish themselves in supermarkets and in food service (which is costly) AND they get scale down. This will be cheaper than most, if not all, meats. Their lack of problems with food borne illnesses is also something that is overlooked.

&#x200B;

I would have to disagree with that application of Margin of Safety. 25% both cannot be the MOS and the discount. Going off engineering applications, the MOS is applied to your intrinsic value estimate, and THEN the discount is calculated. Going off this, a 25% MOS means there is no discount. A 20% MOS on your most optimistic estimate, implies just a 10% discount.

I do not understand what you're asking in the first question, do you think you can phrase it differently? The part about consolidation.

The balance sheet value changes from their share of gains and losses in the JV. It's actually a bit more involved than this, but this practical definition may be fine. Their share of income (loss) adds (subtracts) to the balance sheet value. Additionally, any returns of capital, like dividends, would also lower the balance sheet value. Purchases of additional stakes, but still below 50%, would add to it. If they had to consolidate the JV (ownership above 50%), they'd have to mark the assets to fair value, record a gain/loss on consolidation, then allocate the purchase price accordingly, excess would be goodwill.

You cannot model impairments of assets with any accuracy, unless you have their internal model for the asset to compare to its book value.

Grab is classified as a debt instrument because they have a redemption right attached to the preferred security. They don't for their Didi preferred investment, that's why it is properly classified as an equity security. Even if it seems unlikely that they'll exercise the redemption right, it is still an available for sale debt security. Other than temporary losses get marked through the income statement, though, not unrealized gains/losses, as those go through the equity account. When, or if, they begin to accrue income on it, that would go through the income statement. In the S-1, there are guidelines on how they revalue the preferred securities.

DCF Application for equity affiliates:
Simply, if you do not include the investments in your pro forma modeling, you would value them separately. You may defer to their balance sheet values, or value the securities separately, then add Uber's share of the value to your enterprise value calculation. Just don't double-count: including them in your pro forma projections and as additions to EV.

t3_bhw48w,elwzn24,"Isn't this a cyclical business. I have looked at canfor pulp (subsidiary) and its profits are determined by commodity prices of the lumber made in China or something.  To calculate normalized earnings, I look at your averages for free cash flow and lets say $210M is normalized free cash flow 3-4 years out from now. 

8-11X for a bad/okay business

12-17X for a good business

18 - 22X for great business 

&#x200B;

I personally believed that Canfor should be valued at a 12X multiple (1/12 = 8.33% when a person looks at this stock 3-4 years when it has normalized earnings of $210M). It has low returns on capital, it seems cyclical as well. With that being said, the moderately good case is a 14X if the business starts to increase its ROC and growth is strong and sustainable. 

&#x200B;

Intrinsic Value : $210M X 12 = $2.5B  then subtract total debt and add back cash, ($2.5B - $1.1B = $1.4B)

&#x200B;

I think it might be worth $1.4B but I haven't dived that deep into it. Normalized earnings 2-4 years out can be $300M and the multiple can be 15X (I don't know). This is just my initial guess. 

&#x200B;

Also check out Rich Pzena's views on value investing. What he does, he finds companies that are earning below their normalized earnings. Say if normalized earnings is $10 3-5 years out but the business earns $6.

Asset value as a phrase tends to pop up when easily recognizable notions of value don't seem to relate to valuations being bandied about. Often, though, it's a matter of the buyer having very different views of the monetization prospects than what are incorporated into the price of a publicly traded stock. And often, that turns out to be valid: who is to say current management is truly making the most of an asset's potential, especially if the asset is tied up in a publicly traded co., or a conglomerate type company.

For situations where buyers are more arrogant than rational, or where the plan to maximize value amounts to little more than firing workers, well, that's why we invented bankruptcy. (I did junk bonds in the '80. Been there. seen that.) 

If thinking in terms of NAV, think in terms of standard cash-flow based valuation, but just be a bit more imaginative about ways of getting there (as well as timing).",2,1557347469,[],,,

t3_bncbd0,en50ujz,"Find companies with Dormant Assets:

I don’t think there’s a way to screen for this, but an investment approach I like is buying dormant assets. I usually find these by following hedge funds, like Horizon Kinetics, that seek out these companies. 

Think about it like this, if a 50 story office building is selling for $50m and they currently collect rent of $1m a year, then their PE would be 50. Not exactly cheap, but if you look a little deeper and find out that they only have 1 floor rented out and they expect to rent out the rest of the floors, then you are buying these dormant assets for very cheap. If they rent out even half of the other floors, for similar revenue, you could collect $25m in revenue and their PE would actually be 2x earnings. 

The risk with dormant assets is that they may never collect revenue and the market prices these assets at close to zero. Dormant assets can be everything from raw land with potential oil royalties, patents/IP, or vacant real estate. 

A real life example of this is a company called PrairieSky. They are the largest owner of mineral rights in Canada with over 7 million few simple royalty acres, which sell on the market for about $450 an acre. The problem is that there are no pipelines in place to monetize a large portion of these assets.

t3_bsfqdj,eqcnesv,"The primary driver of this stock is existing home sales - as these have been trending negative, in the short-term, the stock will likely remain under pressure. Secondarily, RLGY's volume declines are outpacing the industry. This is due to their footprint/ SALT deductions, unaffordability concerns esp on west coast, etc. Less apparent but of note are two other important albeit less easily observable variables. There is disruption risks due to Compass and from the business model of Zillow.

Compass is akin to Uber, Lyft and other grow revenue at any cost and disregard any future prospects for profitability business models that survive off raising low quality VC funding and do whatever it takes to dump the toxic waste on public investors so that the founders and early investors can parachute out before the crash and burn. Compass is an irrational competitor due to this model (actually pointed out in the recent Q's MD&A. The interesting mid to long term thesis to support RLGY in this regard is that skeptism is justifiably rising for these pump and dump VC schemes. The incremental capital raises are likely becoming more difficult. Even SoftBank Vision fund will now need to learn how all those income statement line items under revenue work. Additionally, from my scuttlebutt work, I quickly learned that many realitors who have left RLGY to chase the unsustainably high splits & who bought into Compass' bullshit claims around their superior  ""technology"" (giggle) are trying to come back to the RLGY brands (and BH, RMAX, Keller Williams). I believe this trend will continue to reverse as Compass scrambles to try to figure out how to construe some story for the S-1 about future profitability (lower splits coming). As the brokers come back, RLGY's upward split pressures should relax at the same time their broker counts inflect. 

Now for the more complicated issue... Zillow. This has been a slow moving yet impactful issue for RLGY and others in the industry. 80% of eyeballs go to Zillow as a key source of RE rent/purchase information. This is unlikely to change. To be a successful broker, one must purchase Zillow leads. Over the past 10 years, a significant amount of out-of-pocket costs has been incurred by realtors to purchase leads. Although not a direct reimbursement from RLGY, it has become an indirect reimbursement. Because RLGY's does not have a technology offering like Zillow's, realtors justifiably want higher splits and more marketing services to compensate for their out-of-pocket Zillow spend. In short, there is an ongoing shift of value directly out of RLGY and to Zillow. This is a long-term structural issue that cannot be easily solved. 

So, to recap, it appears the consensus monkeys are assuming the Compass issue is a long-term structural issue and the Zillow issue is also long-term structural. I do agree with the later but not the former. I believe this nets out to a general over-reaction on the equity. Interestingly, the bond prices are holding up well. These issues are not lost on all the distress funds who already learned the RLGY story during the last Apollo induced restructuring.

A model, such as a DCF, is a tool for converting one kind of belief into a different kind of estimate. No more, no less. It’s ingredients are risk-adjusted time value of money and the tautological observation that a financial asset is worth the PV of its future cash flows.

Different approaches are suitable for different desired outcomes. If you care where the market in a company’s common equity goes in 6 months, no fundamental valuation metric is going to get you there. If you’re looking for long-term value, a DCF allows you to translate what price levels convert your operating assumptions into what E(return) for the capital stack. Then you need to compare that E(R) (aka WACC) to your best guess of the market’s E(R) (with CAPM being most common estimator prism) and decide whether price-value convergence is likely.

t3_bujuvn,eph1yo1,"Hello /u/openmind_17 !

In my view, the point of doing detailed financial analysis is not to ACCEPT the published figures, but to look for places where you disagree with them.

The general thinking is something like, ""~~***IF*** these figures are accurate~~ EDIT: ***IF*** these figured are taken at face value (accounting itself is mostly estimates), the market is fairly pricing the company at $X. However, what if that expectation is too bullish? Or too bearish? What if `<line_item>`, in practice, is closer to 50% less? How might that impact things?""

One of the caveats to this sort of approach, however, is wrongly assuming that the market does actually give a damn about the underlying financials. Or, to be more precise, that the handful of ""inconsistencies"" you've decided to take action on align with those the broader market feel are important. Which is why it is absolutely critical that every analysis focuses on translating things to real-world repercussions. Otherwise you're just lost in the weeds quibbling over matters that no one else cares about.

For example, if you believe inventory rates are off by a meaningful amount, ask yourself, ""Then what?"" ""Well, if inventory rates are off, that means xyz..."" ""Then what?"" ""Well, then that means blah blah blah."" And you keep tracking this out until you arrive at a plausible effect that will directly impact the cashflows/competitive advantages/etc of the company. Something you can hang your hat on and say with confidence that ***THIS*** is why you disagree with the market's current assessment (which is similar to /u/damanamathos's advice from Damodaran at connecting stats to stories).

And what you're looking for here, are not ""near misses"". You're looking for what you believe are gross errors in estimation. The more the merrier, because at the end of the day, that variance is what helps build up your ""margin of safety"".

Does that help at all?

EDIT: I know you probably meant it a little tongue-in-cheek, but when you say ""the flaws of relying on [valuation]"", I feel what you're really trying to say that is that perhaps the bulk of what we're told to focus on is a bunch of bull. Because in your ending example from Munger, he's absolutely right. At the end of the day, it can be quite simple. The more obvious something is, sometimes the better (again, go back to looking for gross errors of estimation, not ""near misses""). And to me, being a good analyst means being able to drill down on what matters. Not frivolously churning out report after report, as if the report itself is what will ""save you"". No, it's the rationale and reasoning, the thinking behind it.

I'm reminded of a pharmaceutical testing company that raised millions and millions of dollars. Everything was on the up and up. Except for one ""small"" detail... No one ever took the time to look up from the dollar signs to honestly ask the question, ""Wait a sec... But does this actually work?"" 

Long story short, no, the product/service did not actually work. And no one ever bothered to question it. They just swarmed on the ""financial analysis/smoke-and-mirrors"" without asking the most basic of questions.

Big assumption. Ignores structural changes in economy, changes in how ""EPS"" is defined across time, how risk aversion changes wildly across time, etc.

**""Hence, this seems to be a better way to capture the average perception of the market: 6.32% earnings growth warrants a 14.25 P/E multiple.""**

Not a *terrible* assumption (in most instances, solves for a risk premium hundreds of bps too high--but, no, being ultra conservative is not ""good""; this introduces Type II errors in lieu of Type I), but this claim can be tested. Solve for r in the following:

&#x200B;

14.25 = V / EPS = \[EPS(1-G/ROE)/(r-G)\*(1-((1+G)/(1+r))\^T)+EPS((1+G)\^T)\*(1-g/ROE)/((r-g)((1+r)\^T))\] / EPS

Where:

V = Present value of equity cash flow

EPS = Next period EPS/net income/etc.

G = Growth rate in explicit period--6.32% in this case

ROE = Return on equity

T = Length of explicit period in years

g = Terminal growth rate, not to exceed growth rate in general economy--long-term treasury rates as proxy

r = Discount rate

&#x200B;

""r"" less the risk-free rate would solve for an implied equity risk premium. This can then be compared to observed risk premiums and ex ante risk premiums today.

&#x200B;

**""So, a company with >6.32% growth should trade at a higher multiple, and one with lower growth at a lower multiple""**

This claim can be tested and is demonstrably false. For example:

&#x200B;

Company A:

\*Growth rate in earnings = 5%

\*ROE = 8%

\*Discount rate = 8%

\*Expected Net Income = 100

&#x200B;

Company B:

\*Growth rate in earnings = 2%

\*ROE = 10%

\*Discount rate = 8%

\*Expected Net Income = 100

&#x200B;

Company A would trade at a multiple of 12.5 (despite growing faster forever), and company B would trade at a multiple of 13.3. Proof:

&#x200B;

Multiple = V / NI = \[NI(1-g/ROE)/(r-g)\] / NI

Multiple A = 12.5 = 1,250 / 100 = \[100(1-5%/8%)/(8%-5%)\] / 100

Multiple B = 13.3 = 1,333 / 100 = \[100(1-2%/10%)/(8%-2%)\] / 100

&#x200B;

**""Then, you add an adjustment for risk. A company with 6.32% growth but less risk (narrower distribution of possible outcomes) than the average company should trade at a higher multiple, and vice-versa.""**

How much higher? This matters.

&#x200B;

**""This method would only require calculating a growth rate. This could be done with a simplified income P&L forecast sheet, and would be easy to run a sensitivity analysis on.""**

In total, this is overly simplistic, to a fault. If, for example, Trader A and Trader B were the only two participants in a market system, and Trader A (""A"") revealed to Trader B (""B"") his ""valuation"" method as the above, B could easily engage in predatory trading to systematically transfer wealth from A. (This is not merely philosophical. I have spent time as a fundamental short seller along side pro short sellers raking in millions of profits--in bull markets--and individually taking home over $1 million (each) consistently. This is only made possible by the systematic errors of others. Often, I have seen it take the form of a weak understanding of accounting and overly simplistic valuation models--hence why I am bothering to type this out.)

&#x200B;

Trader A would make predictable errors. For example: Buying low-return businesses that manufacture earnings growth. Keep in mind, when I use the term ""manufacture"", I don't mean to imply any sort of accounting manipulation. A serial acquirer/conglomerate can easily manufacture earnings growth through acquisition. But, as demonstrated above, growth alone has virtually no relationship to value--if the conglomerate invests poorly (or actually does engage in accounting manipulation/games, which acquisition accounting is well suited for), then Trader A will artificially increase the demand, and, therefore, price, of the conglomerate's securities. Trader B can then take advantage of this, by either selling out, or increasing the supply via short sales.

Also I'll drop this quote here from Buffett specifically on Beta:


&nbsp;


> ""I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward. Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. If someone were to say to me, ""I have here a six-shooter and I have slipped one cartridge into it. Why don't you just spin it and pull it once? If you survive, I will give you $1 million."" I would decline — perhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer me $5 million to pull the trigger twice — now that would be a positive correlation between risk and reward!


&nbsp;


> The exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dollar bill for 60 cents, it's riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for 40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case. The greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less risk there is.


&nbsp;


> One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was selling for $80 million in the market. At the time, that day, you could have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than $400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned the Post, Newsweek, plus several television stations in major markets. Those same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person who would have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.


&nbsp;


> Now, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made the valuation $40 million instead of $80 million, its beta would have been greater. And to people that think beta measures risk, the cheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in Wonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it's riskier to buy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 million. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities and you know anything at all about business valuation, there is essentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particularly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles of $8 million each. Since you don't have your hands on the $400 million, you want to be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people, but that's not a difficult job.""",14,1561579347,[],,,

You still have a problem. Yes, capm is mostly useless, but it doesnt make too much sense either to compare cost of opportunities with different risks. Maybe if you use sharpe, but then youre back to volatility.

Another anomaly im studying is that low volatility stock tend to have higher returns than high volatility stocks. Meaning: lower risk = higher returns. Doesnt makes any sense right?

t3_c6ovln,esf0ra7,"thanks for sharing. I generally agree with the thesis and believe the magnitude of FCF generation is really what makes the IRR work even through a decade of valuation multiple compression (say, a 7% drag as multiple compresses from 40 to 20, but with FCF>net income, growth comes with minimal need for IC).

I think everyone in the industry acknowledges that the service fee is a race to the bottom and will approach zero in due time. You can approach that as a positive or a negative, given slower growth is offset by higher barriers to entry as it raises the bar for minimal scale to participate. I wouldn't be surprised if at some point large HSA providers *need to pay* for the *privilege* to manage large enterprise accounts. I'd imagine at that point though we have hit a large inflection in the S-curve and multiple winners will have surfaced. 

At the end of the day this is an enterprise driven decision, and so the decision to participate is made at executive levels. The $3-4 fee exists among all top 3 (United, Webster, HSA) so isn't unique. Fidelity probably puts increased pressure to progress this down to zero, but there's a reason why the major banks and sold their HSA businesses (JPM to Webster, etc.). It's a much more complicated business to service from our diligence. If all it were was ""who has the lowest cost of capital"", the big banks would all have stayed and been de-facto winners

There probably isn't a huge difference between any of the HSA providers (there also isn't a huge difference between checkings accounts between wells, bac, or JPM, but accounts are still really sticky and ROEs are quite attractive for a ""commodity"" business), but we thought HE was more uniquely positioned as they have been winning market share and use an internally developed software that can be more uniquely tailored (Webster uses a white label...hence the absolute zero difference against other HSA providers).

Thanks for the thoughts everyone. Two main criticisms: 


&nbsp;


*1) Lack of Competitive Advantage*

So this is probably the biggest hangup with this stock. I get people's anecdotal complaints about customer service, but realize all of these HSA providers have anecdotal experiences like these... **all of them**... The *facts* are that HQY has sustained HSA additions faster than their second and third largest competitor combined, and that HSA customers have proven to be exceptionally sticky. Another factor that was unmentioned RE: growth concerns is their revenue is tied to AuM, which not only grows from # of accounts under administration, but **cash balances within the accounts**, which only continue to grow year after year. It's also tied to prevailing interest rates, which not only serves somewhat as a hedge, but is arguably a secular boon given what 50-year historical rate curves look like.  In addition, net income growth % will meaningfully outpace revenue/HSA additions as cash margins skyrocket and $ is plowed back into the business. From my perspective, it's hard to argue that customer complaints will hinder a 5-year compound 50%+ net income growth sufficiently to drop <25% given the overwhelming positives. To own this stock, you don't need any sort of catalyst or re-rating, you're actually betting on anything better than a de-rating and fairly pessimistic status-quo. 


&nbsp;


/u/galt325 made very important comments regarding competitive dynamic as well (enterprise decision, complicated nature of business, bigger institutions exiting biz) that argue against the importance of customer experience/fee (although these *are* important and I do believe HQY mgmt is privy to these factors!). RE: betting on other, cheaper competitors to ride the HSA trend, I would much rather go with the pure-play dominating the landscape. As mentioned, the magnitude of potential FCF generation is disconnected with the current price of the stock.


&nbsp;


*2) Regulatory Risk*

Regulatory risk **needs** to be taken into account, but in my opinion there's not much more to be said. As far as healthcare legislation goes, bi-partisan support is a big deal and HSAs have that.

t3_c9kswp,et0cwpr,"I don't necessarily think any of the answers are wrong, I just want to add to them and mesh what a few people are saying.  First off I want to say I don't think ROIC to Div Yield is the right way to look at this, but I would think ROE vs. Div Yield would be a useful capital allocation metric. I say this because div yield is more related to return on equity than ROIC.  A company like Ford probably has a very low cost of debt, and their overall ROIC is dampened by the amount of financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  The next thing I wanted to say is previous ROE or ROIC are not set in stone and neither are dividends.  Dividends may be expected, but they are not required.

So to what others have said, it is not beneficial to buyback stock that is over priced, but your question specifically implies that the stock has a high (or at least higher than ROE) dividend, which could mean the shares are undervalued.  So yeah if a company has invested in maintenance Capex and is looking at how best to deploy new equity, projected ROE for a specific project vs. dividend yield on the stock would be a useful metric to look for and in all honestly if ROE is lower than the dividend yeild then they probably should buy back stock because of what you were getting at, which is remaining shareholders are getting a better yield than deploying the money into the business.  However, also as others have said, this is likely a death spiral, and really you only see this type of capital allocation used by the ""cash cows"" if you are familiar with the BCG Growth-Share Matrix.

&#x200B;

One more thing to add, simply assuming the company has cash equity to deploy beyond what is needed to operate the business and pay the existing dividend, over the long run, is pretty much implying that the company is making an ROE above its dividend yeild.",2,1562376789,"[['ROIC', 3]]",ROIC,17.149999618530273,18.020000457763672

t3_cqba2j,ewv4h2l,"Full disclosure: I run a startup that builds detailed financial models for hedge funds. Prior to that used to be a buyside analyst.

The issue I have noticed with modeling (and this is true for both sellside and buyside):

a. Like you said, not knowing what to model. Finding out the key drivers, and what drives the key drivers are not always obvious. Getting to the actual KPIs sometimes isn't exactly obvious too. For example, if you looked at a company like CMCSA, they disclose so much KPI (over 100) that you can't really fault someone for wanting to skip a couple of those. Modeling those out is going to take a long time.

b. Getting the numbers right. The issue here is not often because someone typed a number wrong. It's because they relied on a data source that had a wrong number. It's easy to just want to rely on one of the many data sources out there, but bear in mind most of them use some form of outsourced labor to perform the input. And if/when they make a mistake, the data is contaminated.

c. This is probably the biggest issue, which is not knowing what there has been. If you looked at DIS's latest filings, you would not know what their previous disclosure looked like, because they changed them after the FOX acquisition. If you look at pretty much any company's GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment table, you won't know what the full list of adjustments are. And there is no easy way to find them. This area of ""unknown unknowns"" makes it incredibly hard to build a detailed model that ties up. This is why you see so many models with plugs like ""other"" just to tie up numbers. Often this is fine, but once in a while, you miss something pretty big.

The one stylistic thing I have noticed, is those who are really good at modeling, tend to have a lot of data in their models, but they keep it clean and neat, while those who are newer, tend to have huge models with a ton of calculations everywhere, but actually have less data. I guess with anything in life anyone can complicate, but it takes an expert to simply.

Even forecasts from professionals with ostensibly perfect information, like CorpDev/FP&A teams, cannot model fixed-cost-absorption with accuracy. The sell side and buy side can't, either. Synergies/M&A integration is not modeled with any [honest] consistency (internally/externally), and the synergies may just come from reversals of liabilities set up during the purchase price allocation (seriously).

Nobody, regardless of how robust your model is (expert networks, channel checks, proprietary data sets, industry contacts, or you have the numbers since you're a corpdev/fp&a employee), knows what will happen in the future with precision. Sell side models are continuously revised, so are buy side models, so are private equity operating models, and so are internal models.

Models are better served to track operating performance and assess the expectations embedded in stock prices, in my opinion. You can aggregate all the information you want, but you need to understand that this will not necessarily improve your forecasts. Maybe it will make you feel better about yourself and give you more confidence.

This may seem needlessly nitpicky but I think it's good advice for you. Work on your presentation. Be a tad more professional and less casual. Even if you have good reasoning/facts, no one will believe you if presentation is poor.


&nbsp;


A) Your pitch is very verbose for the actual contained information. Be more concise. This is my biggest gripe with your pitch.


B) Avoid any grammatical errors, run-on sentences, disorganized structure, redundant language etc. One or two is fine but too many and it gets hard to comprehend. As bad as it is, even if English is not your first language people will judge you regardless.


C) Use less subjective adjectives, provide more hard data/numbers. It will add to your credibility which is really important when pitching anyone. (Examples: ""potentially very near-term"", ""ugly-looking"", ""seems extremely difficult""). 


D) This reads as too speculative IMO. I have made good investments based chiefly on insider ownership/perception of management. However, providing your thoughts on all of why you believe people own the stock, why they may sell it, what management believes, exact date the stock will run up, etc detracts from your credibility. Try to provide only the facts around those circumstances and let your reader do the speculating/connect the dots.

I have some reservations on the idea based on both the setup and the valuation discussion. You should note that I am highly ignorant of CBL, in particular, and even retail REITs, more broadly. I also know nothing of Michael Ashner.

It's evident that everything turns on the operating asset valuations -- whether explicitly for any assumed liquidation program, or implicitly in the case the preferreds are kept intact.  I won't quibble with your figures from brokerage data and the related arithmetic. But I would throw in a smell test. As you explained, the cap rates you're using deliver common equity prices of 5x to 11x from current levels.  Now maybe some of the discount from potential is macro/retail driven, and maybe much of it is technical re covenants, but a -90% discount from model for present-day assets can't be hand-waved away so easily when the security is liquid and active.

Now obviously the whole game is looking for such price disparities, and these sorts of beaten-down asset plays always come with hair. But, to me, such a wide delta to model requires even more evidence or data to pass any negative check. While conceding that your analysis might be exactly correct, it seems to me that the evidence requires more than classifying their assets into a descriptive bucket and applying an aggregated data point from a third party.

The setup itself is risky if you don't have high confidence in the valuation range.  That is, if one felt, as perhaps you do, that the preferreds were an attractive security on a standalone basis, then Mr. Ashner's involvement is a freeroll. But if one were not sufficiently convinced of the suitability of the standalone preferreds, then putting on the trade just compounds the valuation issue by placing it inside a conditional probability of his activism success. Put differently, you're saying there's a value to a call option (with a ceiling) of the underlying operating assets against the senior debt strike with a term of activism length.  Now whether that call option is in the money is the valuation question, but whether that option even exists is based on Mr. Ashner's motives and success, which you're basing on past form. You could be prescient and clock his behavior down pat; or he might juke left instead of right this time. But if he breaks pattern then you'd better be comfortable with holding a bag consisting of the weakest form of both debt and equity.

Anyways, if you put it on, here's hoping you grab a nice pelt for your belt. And do be sure to brag about it. gl",3,1567830023,[],,,

To that end, in order to access Quandl data, you need to either a) subscribe to a paid/premium database or b) use a free one. In either case, you'll need a Quandl account so you can get an API key which you'll use to identify yourself to Quandl and then they can use it to determine whether you have access to the database you're trying to access. 

Probably one of the easiest to use is Sharadar, which I use extensively for [this site](https://www.lazyfa.com/explore/). The majority of the fundamentals come from the [SF1 database](https://www.quandl.com/databases/SF1/documentation). 

To access it with Python you would do something like this, assuming you've pip installed quandl:

The above is a pandas dataframe of the time series annual revenue, net income and EPS of AAPL, MSFT and TSLA.

The other databases in Quandl work basically the same way, so my recommendation would be to join quandl and get an API key and just start playing around with some of the free databases using this method to get used to it.

t3_d8e8h5,f19z3ol,"For the first two questions, he's basically saying that, because so many people are just buying the indexes and not actually researching the underlying stocks or bonds to discover if they are a undervalued/overvalued or not, it is just artificially pumping up the prices of everything on the index. This is what is short-circuiting the price discovery method, or the natural interplay of supply and demand for securities in the market -- or, as you alluded to, the mechanism to discover the security's intrinsic value. 

You can think of the index funds like a cable bundle. If QVC is only available as a standalone channel, maybe only a couple of million households would want to subscribe, so its subscription price would be pretty low. However, since it is bundled with 200 other channels, now tens of millions of households who wouldn't think QVC is worth having if they had to pay for it by itself, are now paying subscription fees for QVC through their cable bundle, artificially inflating the demand for QVC, and as a result, the price.

Broadly, yes, price discovery is being muted by large institutions required to purchase securities regardless of whether it is logical to do so. What I think you're asking is *why* Burry thinks that.

If that's what you're asking, the real answer is long and boring.

**Long Boring Answer:**  
Here's the Basel III document he's referring to - note this isn't a Bloomberg write-up. It's regulation. I've also attached some additional reading that may be of use.

The issue Burry is describing is a mechanical one (currently impacting the repurchase markets for the Fed's primary dealers). Several large entities (banks, governments, etc) are required to purchase a certain amount of debt securities (bonds, treasuries) regardless of price. This excessive demand - brought about by regulation - has inflated the price of many debt securities to the point where yields are negative or zero (simplifying here).

Similar dynamics are now prevalent through most of the equity markets as well. For instance, ETF XYZ states it will buy shares in companies falling into a broad category (an index, industry, sector or market capitalization). Therefore, regardless of how those companies actually perform, the prices of their securities will rise due only to demand brought about by additional capital. However, if prices rise solely due to additional demand - and not an underlying improvement in the profitability of the company - returns must diminish. (\[$1 / 10\] = 10%; \[$1 / 20\] = 5%).

Price appreciation for that reason is only sustained as long as another buyer is present. Otherwise, price declines - and selling - will occur until it matches demand. In effect, Burry is observing (1) people do not fully understand what they are buying from a fundamental perspective and (2) when they do, they may be forced into liquidating or selling securities in depressed markets. The underlying fundamentals of a business itself won't be jeopardized in that situation per se. Rather, the ability for one to sell a business' securities in a timely matter may be stalled (severely).

In that situation, someone with no knowledge of what the ""true"" or ""intrinsic"" value of a company (and its securities) are will be at a disadvantage to someone who does. Hypothetically, the knowledgeable one will behave differently and either buy from the uninformed or simply keep their shares.

Burry is just saying - at least I think he is - he's observed this phenomenon in the market again. However, he's not sure how it will end or what the ramifications are other than to simply *not* engage in it.

**Short and Sweet Answer:**  
Underlying business performance doesn't improve just because the stock or bond price goes up. Either lower returns will be indefinitely accepted by the buyer(s) (unlikely) or at some point the demand trend will reverse and selling will occur (more likely).

However, due to the massive grouping of funds since the mid-2000s, the mechanics behind aggregate selling make the process more hazardous. The people who bought without understanding will sell without understanding and that mechanic will likely come back to harm them.

Burry and others are probably waiting patiently for those people to sell low.

However, I don't really think the thesis holds water. This is really a credit story - can they de-lever enough to maintain an IG rating? I don't think that is proved here at all as it is a more nuanced issue. This isn't your fault and you won't be penalized for it in an interview setting as you flesh out the de-leveraging story I think about as well as someone in your position could. 

First, I'd recommend building a roll-forward liquidity schedule by quarters as far as you can where you basically bridge BOP liquidity to EOP liquidity and see how the dividend coverage looks. Look at it from the perspective as free cash flow available for debt repayment before dividend and after...if the after look sketchy you may need think about cutting the dividend more than you already anticipate and keep in mind the timing for when this may happen. 

It'll be interesting to see what their cash generating ability to pay down debt is without taking into account the asset sales. 

On the asset sales, I may have missed it but your own work on what these businesses are worth as well as their standalone financial results and growth rates, if possible, would be better to determine a value as opposed to media reports. The media reports, you may find, might be low or high balling it. 

Segmenting the maturity schedule by issue is important because if you have $1 billion of bonds coming due next year, and you sell the businesses for $1 billion, there might be covenants that require the proceeds be used to pay down bank debt first, so you might need to check that out. In which case, the bonds can be refinanced but you'll need to take into account the new interest rate in your model as it will likely be more expensive than what they're originally paying. 

I'd also look to see what the ratings agencies said for criteria leading to more up/downgrades. I kinda remember seeing somewhere that sustained leverage above 4.0x will lead to a downgrade, and in your model you're at 3.9x so its pretty on the fence.

Either way, the question is never valuation but whether the fundamentals/economics of the business deserve that valuation. You can buy any company at any valuation, the issue is whether the growth over the next five or ten years is going to justify your price.

To take the only actual point that has content: why would this company stop spending on marketing? How do you know what the effect on the top-line would be? The issue with most SaaS companies isn't growth, it is the economics: you can pay someone to buy junk from you, you will show revenue but it doesn't mean that you are creating value.

And three major issues with SaaS generally are: when they show data (they often don't) it looks like they spending too much on marketing, their fixed costs look huge, and when the cycle turns it seems likely that some companies will lose a ton of revenue. Saying: but what if we just didn't count their costs isn't research. Even if they could reduce those costs, do I want to invest in someone who flushed my cash down the toilet in the first place? No.

If you are thinking about actual investing - I pray that the person who wrote the above is not managing money - then just go to where the cheap stocks are. Trying to find value in SaaS stocks makes literally no sense.

If you are interested in business generally or just looking for high-quality companies then fine...eventually, all these companies will blow up to some degree...but if you actually need to find ideas today then this makes no sense.

t3_du6tgm,f72k19z,"After my own review I see some merits in being bullish on GME, but not for the same exact reasons as yours.
  
The biggest strength GME appears to have is brand awareness, with customers still OK with buying console hardware and games from their physical stores, and not just from major retailers with an online presence (Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc.).   Also GME's operating margins are pretty good, this past year being the 11%-12% range, which allows them to generate steady Free Cash Flow.
  
Also it's positive that GME's management is aware they need to be defensive and are taking actions to protect the balance sheet and focusing on effective cost-cutting efforts.

The biggest weakness I see for GME is they will face significantly lower sales, with a growth rate that will probably continue to decline in years to come, despite the upcoming new console cycle.  In my DCF I used a long-term average of 2% sales decline over 10 years.  But even with that decline the high operating margin still allowed GME to be cash flow positive over the valuation period.

However I don't see GME getting to a 24% operating margin quickly, due to the wide competition in the gaming products space. But even with a 12% operating margin GME still came out cash-flow positive in my model, with a valuation over $30 per share.

The biggest problem with pricing GME is that market sentiment is against them.  The Shorts believe the company will go bankrupt, and analysts have also thrown in the towel with constant downward price-target revisions and not able to see any positive catalysts.  I've read recent analysts price targets range from $3 to $8.  But their analysis appears more reactive to current conditions than trying to uncover any hidden value.  These factors will make it difficult for the company to get back over $10 per share.  But showing profit again could help push them over the $10 hurdle.
  
More evidence for the bullish case includes interest from Scion Capital's Dr. Michael Burry, who sent public letters to GME's board members a few months back arguing for more buybacks.  Discussions for that letter can be found searching this subreddit.  The Barron's article that covered the news mentioned that Burry was also concerned that GME's management could make another bad acquisition, so perhaps that why Burry urged the Board to return capital back to investors for now.
  
From my own empirical experience I can see where there may still be a need for games on physical disks for a while.  Two weeks ago I purchased the recent Call of Duty: Modern Warfare title, for the digital edition, and found the game download was going to be 120GB in size.  Even tonight I'm still trying to download the game, as Activision's Battlenet is throttling the download so I'm only getting 2MB a second.   If I had known of the hassle I would have gladly headed over to a Gamestop and bought the physical disk.  
  
If the triple-A gaming titles will continue to increase in size each year, like the latest Call of Duty title has, and customers won't increase their broadband speed at an equivalent rate, then consumers may still prefer physical disks for new titles.

So how much flexibility do they on costs? Is the 5-10% stores enough? How flexible are the leases? And can you trust management to actually return capital?

I have no idea on the first points but management are handling this as well as I have ever seen in retail. The buyout is still the bull case here so it is a little concerning that financing failed. I am not surprised because the bonds would lose money almost every time on such a deal...but weird things happen. Who is going to try and get finance now they have seen this fail? But...it is really rare to actually see management handle these situations proactively.

Criticisms: you don't cover risks. Understanding what will happen when things go wrong is very important, and you need to think about how other people will react in those situations. One major issue with these situations is that even if they outperform financially, no-one will take you out 50% higher (and this works in reverse if things go wrong). You also need to think about the cycle of releases. There is no upside with the release cycle but huge downside so you need to keep it in mind.

My opinion: why bother? If you are a pro, this situation is worth going into. but you are going to have to invest a lot of time and energy. I would much rather own a situation where time isn't working against me.

I did a double-take on this.

&#x200B;

>Misperception: Gamestop is the next Blockbuster

This is related to the first ""misperception."" The problem is that Gamestop's business model is fundamentally no longer relevant due to changing technology. You can buy games online - without going outside - and increasingly so, this is the only way to buy games. When people refer to GME being like Blockbuster, they really mean that Netflix (and streaming) is the superior solution to solving the problem (watching movies and TV shows) than the solution Blockbuster provided. Gamestop is the same way, in my opinion, and I don't think there is any debate that this is a business model that's in secular decline.

So the question is, how fast is this secular decline and how to value that.

&#x200B;

>New operating lease standards force Gamestop to put >700 m of new  ""debt"" onto their balance sheet, forcing EV numbers up and causing  retail / systematic selling from investors using formulas/multiples  blindly. Confusion around EV seems to permeate through VIC / seeking  alpha. Nevertheless, the average operating lease duration is only 2  years, and mandatory lease payments following an almost exponential  distribution. The real question is should this ""debt"" with zero  incremental interest payments (already included on the income statement)  and a 2 year duration be treated as debt? I would disagree, especially  considering the store closures we will see from management and the fact  that these ""operating lease debts"" resemble accounts payable rather than  long-term debt.

Whether or not operating lease right-of-use liabilities should be considered like ""Debt"" or ""debt-like"" and if they should be included in EV calculation is an interesting question, but it is really just like capital leases with shorter maturities. But it should change how we think about EBITDA and EV multiples. Regardless, it's still a liability representing future cash outflow. Look at net cash flow and shouldn't be any different. Not only that, this accounting standard is..... standard. It affects everyone equally and GME is not unique in that. If you really think this caused stupid sale in the entire retail industry, you have an opportunity to arbitrage that.

If you look at the game passes both Xbox and Sony have they are an amazing deal. The game pass ultimate has amazing deals which will limit sales of new and used games.

* So long as India has policies that encourage capitalism and entrepreneurs, we might be surprised by how much it can accomplish despite apparent headwinds. Looking back over the past 100 years for the U.S., we had a lot of disasters, but the stock market kept growing despite everything. Being the big victor after WW2 helped immensely, so it's not a great comparison... but you get the idea. When each person in an economy is incentivized right, the combined power of the people is immense enough to overcome even major hurdles. It's something that is hard to analyze concretely in numbers, but it's also a powerful big-picture idea.
* One major thing India has in it's favor is the ability to grow its population. Zero or negative population is a major killer for economic growth (at least, under the current Keynesian and Monetarist models of economics) and I would argue that is one reason why people are actually overestimating China's growth potential.
* A big threat to India that I see is that China is building trade routes around India and importing ethnic Chinese to those locations. When China has a bigger navy force in a few decades, they may be able to isolate India significantly from global trade (soft pressure/power). This is important because exports will probably be important for India. The Chinese Communist Party seems to perceive India as one of their major threats and would love to put them in a subordinate position.

The main issue is that customers don't really work that way. The assumption appears to be that all these variables are very well-behaved, distributions gather around the mean, and nothing weird happens...

...well, that isn't reality. How are average purchase values distributed across customers? How fat are the tails of purchase frequency? Average customer lifespan is going to be very volatile, and the mean is definitely not stationary (i.e. it will correlate to product cycle). Perhaps most importantly, averaging across all customers makes no sense in most cases...some customers will be very valuable, most won't be.

Either way, the issue you are going to get in reality is: companies whose numbers look good by this metric report it, you are making these very specific claims about customer behaviour years into the future...usually the product didn't even exist during the last cycle, certainly not at this scale...and you will just get a number that correlates to reported earnings i.e. you aren't creating new information.

If you pursue decisions based on the lifetime value of a customer, always outspending revenue and posting losses, and you do this even past the day of peak revenue or customer size, then you’ll burn cash all the way down too.

I can’t comment on Starbucks. But some software companies might be playing this game. Maybe through M&A. The ones I’ve looked at shouldn’t blow up but the temptation of going beyond rational acquisition expenses to show revenue growth is so great that I wonder when firms will back off and say “enough. It’s not rational at a certain price to attract a new customer.” It’s not how tech works though. One of their key assumptions has to be retention time. Cloud based software providers aren’t exactly the same as the old school enterprise license stuff. It might be in many ways but not all. Assumptions for retention years should be closely thought through IMO. I don’t think there’s a huge issue but I can think of at least one company that I’m suspicious of. 

I’ve seen insurers do it and then it depends on the profitability metric they assume - some expect to sell products at a profit but their underwriting data sure doesn’t even come close to what they’re pricing in. I think it’s just a good way for management to justify greater marketing and acquisition expenses. Who doesn’t want growth?

I very very highly doubt that the Malaysian MOH can roll back the minimum price because it's political suicide. The MOH and MOF also do not work together, and PH has been unable to clean up the system so far. MOF is incentivized for budget reasons, but they need MOH onboard which is an entirely different story.

Illicit recovering is the ultimate bull thesis for BAT Malaysia, but your GPM and EPS will compress dramatically - The unit economics for Rothman vs Dunhill is world's apart (eg: Rothman gives you almost 0 profit).

The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back is vaping IMO - BAT Malaysia's Glo product has been delayed for ridiculously long although PM's iQos has been allowed to launch. Perhapsdue to the noise that BAT Malaysia is making? Anyway, vaping has already taken 5-10% of the market in a short span of <1yr, and most of this is illicit vape. The problem comes round back to pricing - Most consumers cannot and will not pay RM100+ for a device and vape liquid when they can buy the ilicit version for RM20. In any case, the government's response to vaping was to ponder a ban - This just tells me they completely misread the situation. If they do ban vaping, this handicaps BAT and allows illicit to grow (ala normal cigarette story all over again)

In this sense, there is 0 moat. BAT Malaysia cannot compete against illicit fundamentally and structurally. I think any bull call on BAT Malaysia is effectively a long call option on Malaysia becoming a 1st world country, which could take 0-50 years. You also run the risk of getting privatized cheaply by the parent group. Yes you get some dividend, but in my opinion the time frame required to get a decent return on capital and probability puts this at a weaker risk-reward.

ROE of 100% here doesn't mean much. BAT Malaysia doesn't  a real balance sheet, and pays out almost 100%. They're effectively a trading company, and have already removed majority of their manufacturing capabilities. Also, if I remember correctly, the MOH has publicly stated that they are not concerned with illicit but rather only with legal volumes wrt KPI (don't ask me how this makes any sense but Malaysia doesn't make sense most of the time).

* How confident are you that there is not a trend towards less tobacco use in Malaysia? I see no comment on this in the analysis that alludes to it (I could be off an the smoking culture could be alive and well). This company seems to be fighting multiple macro and geopolitical trends
* Revenues have shown a steady decline for the past five years, with income following. Looking at a TTM P/E in this situation is actually a rosy view considering earners were higher in the past than a trend extrapolation
* Balance sheet - looks fine but I think ""much rosier"" is truly only a relative term. I have not concerns on business solvency
* Confused as to how a fair estimate of value for acquisition in 15x earnings considering the market is currently valuing them at 8x. Declining companies are not going to demand a \~100% price premium

t3_ev8i0j,ffwbbt1,"Nice write-up, and definitely some great optionality if Malaysia gets its act together and tackles the illegal trade. I can see this being a 1% position in a portfolio as a sort of ""punt"". 

Speaking as a professional investor, there are two things in the thesis that I personally would need to address before my investment committee would even consider looking at it as a ""punt"" (remembering that a high-risk, high-payoff stock needs to have a strongly-argued upside scenario, even if improbable):

1. You need some evidence that:
   1. The Malaysian government can reduce taxes on legal cigarettes (the ""sin"" tax). Has this ever been done in the past? If not, why should we believe it will be done in the future? You need a well-reasoned argument in favour of falling sin taxes rather than a gut feel
   2. That smoking is not in a long-term secular downtrend.
2. Your thesis is predicated to some extent on dividend stability which can be used to recuperate capital even in a scenario where the business continues to decline. However, you need to address the fact that the company has consistently cut dividends since at least 2014 (per Capital IQ) and will likely continue to do so in order to maintain a 90% payout ratio. Why should we believe that it won't be cut further? If you can come up with a positive answer in (1) above then this would answer the dividend question.
   1. Another commenter pointed out that levered FCF is the best metric and I think that is correct here. The metric accounts for interest payments on debt and shows how much cash the company can pay out after debtholders are satisfied. Levered FCF has been consistently less than dividend payments which is unsustainable to my mind and would need to be addressed as the company can only continue to do this if it increases its gearing.

t3_fewwgq,fjst9dh,"So there is one major thing missing in your analysis.

CFR is not an intrinsic, static property of an illness. CFR depends on the quality of the healthcare the sick person receives.

If a sick population can get all the healthcare they need then the CFR will be as low as possible. If a population is not getting the healthcare they need, the CFR will be much higher.

The CFR has been low in China, South Korea, etc because there has been an unprecedented drive by those governments to give anyone feeling the smallest bit unwell as much healthcare as possible. In south korea they have drive-in where you can get tested from your care. In china they are awarding $1400 to those who come forward and report coronavirus symptoms. And of course there was the massive quarantine of hundreds of millions of people in china.

Imagine if we did the same things here for the flu. The CFR for the flu would be nearly 0%.

But that is not happening here.  We are barely even testing. So apparently the plan is to just let people get sick and let the hospitals handle the most sick.

Unfortunately, the need for healthcare with coronavirus is much higher than for the Flu. Most estimates are that at least 5% will eventually need at a minimum supplemental oxygen.

Now if coronavirus had a very low R factor and was not very contagious, this would not be an issue. Our healthcare system could easily take care of these few people.

But that's not the care. Coronavirus is even more contagious than the flu. The flu has an R factor of about 1.3. Right now estimates for Coronavirus put it's R factor between 2 and 3.

The American Hospital Association put these two numbers together and guess how many ICU admissions they expect: 1.9 million. This is 20x the amount of seasonal flu admissions.

So if you have a disease more contagious than the flu, where up to 5% of those infected need at a minimum supplemental oxygen, then it is easy to see that our healthcare system will not be able to provide the maximum(or even the minimum healthcare) to all that need it. And so the CFR for us in the United States be on the very high end.

Couple points. 

1) KMX ABS debt are in bankruptcy remote SPVs, this debt does not affect KMX parent. KMX parent is remarkable unlevered.

2) Little of KMX retained loan issuance are to sub-prime customers. KMX has some of the lowest delinquency and default rates in the auto industry. Most actual sub prime loans they originate are sold to third party banks for an origination fee. 

3) GAAP accounting for ABS issuance obfuscates free cash flow because they are categorized as cash flow from financing. For FY19, you net issuance and payments of non-recourse notes payable and add the balance to cash flow from operating activities. This gets you to $1 billion operating cash flow and $700 million free cash flow. 

4) People don't cut their car loans in times of crisis, they cut their mortgage payments. You can live in your car but you can't drive your house to work. This is what happened in 2008.

Net income isn’t how you measure business performance for this company (FCF is) since it doesn’t include net interest income from CAF which makes up the lions share of the FCF.

I do agree that demand will contract but only slightly (it’s an inferior good so should actually higher volumes sales but lower price per car imo - when people feel worse off they buy used cars rather than new cars. This opinion is debatable)

Most of the debt is non recourse to core KMX and is instead attributable to CAF and backed by sold used cars. They amount of debt that is actually attributable to core KMX is actually extremely low (can’t pluck out the exact no off the top of my head right now but net debt is a very low multiple of EBITDA. )As a result, they are actually capitalized quite conservatively.

That being said, KMX has some serious competitive advantages over rivals and this will only deepen (as rivals will experience greater losses due to worse underwriting and lack of scale). In the long run, you have an opportunity to buy a company that still has a long runway to further expand in the US with normalized ROIC of 13-15% and is trading at double digit FCF yield.

> Mortgage rates rose again this week as lenders increased prices to help manage skyrocketing refinance demand. This is expected to be a short-term phenomenon as lenders work through their backlog. On the purchase front, daily loan purchase applications were rising as of mid-February but started to decline last Friday.

Rates are highly volatile and changing every day. People have lost a lot of money (some of which was undoubtedly savings for home) and are concerned about losing their jobs. Job market will soon freeze and unemployment will rise. More people won't be able to make rent or mortgages, and we will see more inventory. It's simply not the time to buy a home, and buyers are holding off and waiting due to uncertainty, even for those with funds to be deployed. The unemployment number from last month is irrelevant and, in my view, so are the housing numbers. I expect construction and renovation activities in general to be disrupted from the COVID-19 precaution as well as supply chain disruptions - there is limited quantitative data on this but this is certainly happening already. All these things are already happening, and are expected to get worse as financial institutions and governments wrap their head around the situation. Seeing what is happening in Spain, Iran and Italy, I believe it will get a lot worse in the US before it gets better.

Many are still trading at only modest discounts to 12/31/19 NAV. Meanwhile, the high yield and leveraged loan market is down big since year-end. Many BDCs have substantial leverage, so a 15%-25% decline in gross asset value hits NAV much harder. Earnings are also going to be down significantly due to decline in interest rates and huge jump in non-accruals, most won't earn their dividend. On top of all this, many BDCs have inflated their asset values going into this, especially with respect to equity investments.

1. This thing has been a FCF machine in recent years, but how will rising unemployment and an economic downturn affect that?

Will warranty expenses go up?). We've sort of had an unprecedented run in both employment and home sales.

2. Debt balances (2.8x EBITDA) are reasonable, and that includes cap leases. Highly doubt they default, they are IG and will refinance the debt in a few years.

Acquisition is extremely poorly timed. It drains cash when they need it the most. And one might argue they overpaid even before coronavirus. SPG management has been chasing TCO for a long time, and I question if they are not just acquiring for the sake of growing. TCO assets are high quality, though neither class A malls nor outlets are safe or high quality investments. You can think of investing in shopping malls like investing in coal power plants; still around, but on their way out. TCO was distressed and would likely have sold assets at some point. This acquisition immediately kills a lot of value for SPG shareholders.


>In the very worst case scenario, where SPG keeps all malls closed, reimburses their tenants all rent, consummates the deal with TCO at the full price of $3.6 bn, and is unable to secure any new credit, they will still be able to remain solvent for almost 11 months.

The ""worst"" case is that too many tenants go bankrupt, SPG loses tenants and is unable to replace them. Fewer tenant bankruptcies would be the best case. The base case is somewhere in the middle. The big unknown for the worst case is if more people will stop going to malls entirely, both out of new habit and for fear of getting sick, and this has been a problem before coronavirus. Retailers are not opening new stores in this environment, and even after things clear up, very little new investments in brick and mortar will take place for some time at best. In any case, some loss of tenants and revenue are guaranteed.

You can try to be fancy with multiples and models, but it's all just speculation when the coronavirus situation will end and how costly it will be. I feel that it's very far from being a bargain at around $60; it's partly because I never believed SPG to be a bargain at $150/share level.

t3_fr04rj,fluu070,"Making an investment into a mall REIT right now would make you about the most contrarian of an investor there is. More than even oil. These stocks weren’t doing great even before COVID. 

People have been saying the Simons of the world are dead for years. And yet they continue to operate with occupancies in the 90s and generating a ton of cash. 

The A and B malls are sitting on top of some of the most valuable real estate there is. So my long term thesis would be two things: 1. Will retail bankruptcies make it harder to keep occupancy up?  Before COVID it didn’t for Simon. 2. Can they convert parts of their real estate to more valuable uses?  

I own Brookfield so I don’t know SPG as well, but with Brookfield I bought shares because I don’t think malls are dead. I think we just have too many of them. The best ones will survive and thrive.  And if you go to an A mall right now, take a look at what used to be the giant parking lot. It’s now filled with restaurants, free standing stores, and in some cases office buildings. They are making more cash flow from supposedly “dying” mall properties than ever. 

This whole thesis was before COVID, though. Human behavior is going to be changed a lot by this, so we’ll wait and see. I’m holding my Brookfield shares but I’m not loading up at cheap prices to make it an oversized part of my portfolio.  I suspect had I owned none prior to COVID I would probably have not invested right now when we don’t know what’s going to happen.

Second, they don't have that much of their portfolio as a %  in ""A"" malls in my opinion. Actually there are very few ""A"" malls out there to begin with.

I think the key idea you are missing is the financial fortitude of SPGs tenants. No matter how well SPG is positioned, tenant bankruptcies causing even a modest decline in occupancy could spell disaster. Under a best case COVID scenario, I suspect retail leasing will be much more difficult and costly going forward. If occupancy drops from COVID related retail bankruptcies, the leasing prospects on the other side of the crisis will be grim and the stock may never recover.

t3_froc8z,flwwkw2,"Thanks for the idea. I'll add a couple things that you might want to consider going forward:

* 29% upside on ""conservative"" case and 42% upside on ""normalized"" case

Personally, these discounts aren't large enough for me to get excited about an investment. I want to find ideas that can return 100-200% over the next 3-5 years (if I'm right -- big caveat). 

The lower the upside on a normalized basis, the less your margin of safety. What happens if margins come in lower than 14%? Where's the discount to IV at that point? 5-10%? 

If you think the stock's 29% undervalued and you plan on holding it for 3-5 years, your annual return would be between 6% - 10%. Again, that's considering your normal base case happens. If anything goes wrong (which it might), that number lowers. 

* 7% Discount Rate

This seems a bit low given the current environment and your potential desire to outperform the market over decades. What is your reasoning behind a 7% discount rate? Are you satisfied with a 7% return? Remember, your discount rate is your portfolio's return hurdle rate. Higher discount rate = less certain about future of business, lower discount = more certain. 

I'd rather choose the less-certain as I know there's things I don't know, and I want to make sure that the bargain is so good it covers up for all the mistakes I might make, as well as any unforeseen business risks that may come.

>A quick and dirty estimate of annual cash outflow (i.e. burn rate) assuming a $20 oil world and historical production rates is between RM 50m-70m per year

This seems a bit optimistic to me. Can you explain how you got this? Does this include capex? I did some basic calculations assuming a price of 20 USD/bbl, same production levels, Fixed Admin expenses cut by 20%, variable opex of 15 USD/bbl (Cost of sales is 75% of total OpEx/bbl of USD 20). Equipment capex cut by 50% from last year and no Intangible capex.. I got RM 105M in NTM Cash outflow assuming 4.35 USD/MYR.

> The first and most obvious opportunity is the potential for increased production rate. We’ve seen in the last quarter (2Q21) that the North Sabah field increased its daily production rate by approximately 20% as a result of production enhancement projects (infill drilling), lowering OPEX/bbl as a result. 

I think my assumption of 50% cut in equipment capex is VERY lenient if they are to increase production rates going forward. Can this opportunity really be realized in the next 24 months?

t3_g6ov1t,foekjft,"It sounds like you're worried about the balance sheet impact. If so I wouldn't key in too much on expected return on plan assets. The only thing that matters is the discount rate for benefit obligations. The reason is that plan assets is held on the balance sheet at fair value regardless, and what shows up on the balance sheet is the current assets net of projected liabilities. The only thing that would change the net difference is the discount rate assumption, if that's aggressive you'd need to adjust the balance sheet figure for net pension obligation.

If you're wondering one level deeper, the expected return on plan assets is only used to develop next year ""level"" pension expense, which would impact earnings (but NOT cash flows). Higher return assumption -> lower ""expense"" needed to fund the pension from income. However, any aggressiveness in expected vs. actual result on plan assets when you roll forward a year is ""capitalized"" in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is amortized through future income statements (I think it was 7 years...but could be wrong).

I think the Investopedia explanation is an okay one...although I don't think I've found a great resource.

t3_g8lbzv,foo8gdp,"You’re only really scratching the surface of what makes Costco great and not actually finding the key drivers behind why their business model is so pervasive.

1)Their membership model produces a flywheel effect that benefits all constituents. It subsides their extremely low operating margin on goods. More people want to shop there due to cheap prices of goods and this drives further membership growth. There are other secondary effects of the membership model but this is what makes their business model great.

2) Extreme operational efficiency on supply side. They only sell 4000 SKUs in each warehouse which creates ~~monopsony~~ oligopsony power and allows them to dictate the prices their pay for their goods. Their stores are square in shape and include the warehouse in the back to save on warehousing costs. Producers pay Costco to store goods in their warehouse. Workers per store are also the lowest in the industry because of these factors. All this contributes to insanely cheap prices.

3) Good culture - very qualitative but you just have to look at the numbers. Employee turnover at Costco is the lowest in the industry. They pay extremely well causing people to stay and as a result, they save on training costs. Management are well and truly aligned with shareholders in their compensation packages and the way in which they do business. 

Most of your “points” are symptoms of the business model but they aren’t getting into the crux of why Costco is a good business.

Lastly, I have to say your valuation skills need a lot of improving. Discount rate is way higher than 3%. You give no indication of the assumptions behind your model. In my opinion, I have never relied solely on a DCF model to calculate fair value. Research on how to value companies using multiples.",52,1587934535,"[['DCF', 1]]",DCF,6.988999843597412,7.230000019073486
t3_g8lbzv,foobqyq,"Intrinsic value is based off a set of assumptions which differs from every DCF that you do. There are many different factors that you have to look at for Costco that were not stated in your analysis.  Also, DCF is sparsely used in actual valuations of a company as relative valuation offers an easier way to value a company which is why each price target is weighted to determine a suitable average. For example, in your long-term prospects you have to research into the various areas of growth that are still available to Costco and whether or not they are still feasible using their current operating model.

Long-Term Growth: Pros

For example, Costco still has a wide area of warehouse locations possible still in the United States, they have yet to expand as significantly as Walmart. Furthermore, you also need to look into their recent expansion into the Chinese market. Unlike a wide variety of retailers who fail to grow in China, Costco's first warehouse was extremely successful due to the Chinese people widely accepting Costco products. In terms of metrics, a substantial amount of Costco's revenue is directly from memberships YoY, an average location in the United States will only have roughly 80-100k members. While Costco's one warehouse in China had roughly 220k after establishing themselves, which is a significant increase compared to the US. In addition, the Chinese people are very fond of the operating model of Costco, in the sense that they can purchase a wide variety of products in bulk. Which makes sense due to the massive population that reside in China. While this expansion is most certainly a long-term operation, Costco's ability to grow using their brick-and-mortar warehouse model offers a significant growth opportunity if Costco's management is able to successfully implement it.

Long-Term Growth: Cons

In regard to the biggest weakness of Costco, it is without a doubt the movement into the e-commerce industry which is currently dominated by Amazon. With current market sentiments benefitting online retailers or e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Shopify, Costco has yet to successfully venture into the e-commerce industry. Costco has stated this themselves in their most recent 10-k for FY2019. While their brick-and-mortar model is still successful in drawing in large amounts of consumers, the inability to shift into e-commerce threatens long-term growth in the company. As of right now, Costco has begun experimenting with delivery services, but a fully functional platform is still yet to be developed.

Currently Costco sits around the 300-310 price, which was where it was sitting before the Covid-19 impacted the US Stock Market. This is relatively close to the market estimates that you said earlier. While still slightly overvalued, in my opinion, Costco still has a large opportunity to grow and is still a good buy. There's a reason why Buffet has invested in it and why Berkshire invests in the company. As you said they have a wide economic moat, they are resilient in times of an economic downturn which is shown in their current state, they have competent management, and long-term prospects are still apparent.

Sorry if I went a little off topic, but essentially in terms of intrinsic valuation it is better for you to come up with your own method of valuing a company. Buffet's way works well, but you shouldn't solely use his formula for valuing a company. Every investor has a different approach to investing but they can be very similar, especially in value investing a company. One investor can value one metric more than the other, which shifts their assumptions for the firm. Like how Buffet focuses on ROE rather than EPS.

Pretty much to sum up, your intrinsic method is fine, but it shouldn't be the only valuation method used when valuing a company. Using a mixture of DCF and RV is usually the most common way nowadays, with the latter being more weighted. Also, research into their long-term prospects is essential in valuing a firm intrinsically because it heavily affects your growth rates.",14,1587936178,"[['DCF', 3]]",DCF,6.988999843597412,7.230000019073486

I read the book, ""Warren buffet and the interpretation of financial statements"" two days ago. In one section the author talks about how he values businesses like bonds. Costco is like a bond because it's so predictable. When something is less liquid (micro cap) or less predictable (some start up that makes a million one year and losses 5 million the next) would naturally require a higher discount rate than Costco since it is both predictable and liquid. However 3% would be way to low given historic interest rates. Like buffet says, if you think interest rates will stay at close to 0, then stocks are cheap.

Look at debt as well, rule of thumb is not higher than 3 years of net  income. Especially in times like these you really want to stay away from  companies with a lot of debt.   
I also recommend you to look at the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), in its most basic form it is just net income/(equity+debt). Return on equity can be boosted by the use of debt. By looking at ROIC, you can get a more true picture of the ability of the company to generate returns on its capital. You want it to be above 10%.

It is extremely unlikely that Costco will lose members, so the membership fee is essentially a perpetual bond payment that rises along with inflation (maybe a little faster). 

The real return on an inflation protected bond is negative 0.3%. I would probably want to make 3% more to compensate me(because it's hard to say what Costco's competitive position will look like 30 years from now (although I think it will be the same).

A few thoughts on estimating rates: 

* Using the futures curve is interesting. I'm not entirely convinced it's a great check, but I would suggest switching to North Sea instead of WTI since Cushing is landlocked. It looks like the curves were pretty similar on the date this was written. 

* You might need to include some estimate that translates spot rates into a time-charter equivalent. Including bunker/port expenses may be difficult, but idle days should probably be considered.

* There are multiple intelligence services that track VLCC spot and charter rates. These typically cost money, but there's some recent spot and forward BE rates [in this article](https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL1132087/The-week-in-charts-Oil-market-chaos-boosts-charter-rates-Dover-ferry-traffic-suffers) which is a more credible service than the article linked in your blog. 

* In the future, you could consider spot checking against [TI's rates](https://twitter.com/TankersInt) as well which actually should include some DHT ships you are currently estimating.

* I've seen lots of reports estimating charters at about $125k/day for six-months. Your estimation of $200k/day spot looks conservative by this metric as $200k/day for 60 days and then $60k/day after that would yield about $106k/day for six-months.

t3_g960yo,foseaiy,"(1) Airbus and Boeing (“OEM”) control 69% of HXL’s revenue. The way the aerospace supplier industry works is the OEMs have virtually all the power in the relationship. However, to switch to another supplier the OEM must go through a lengthy process where they get permission from the FAA who must validate the new supplier’s products as safe to use in the airplane. This is the reason why relationships are so sticky and why the OEMs allow their supplier base to have decent margins. This model worked well in the last couple of decades due to the tailwind of the aero super cycle. I’m not sure that is the case going forward – industry dynamics are likely to change. The OEMs are having trouble sustaining the same margins, Boeing itself is going through a lot of idiosyncratic problems, and the ramifications of COVID-19 are likely to linger for 3-4 years. There’s a strong case to be made that the OEMs will exercise their power in the relationship and start squeezing some suppliers to sustain their own margins. Are you comfortable HXL’s 21% EBITDA margins are sustainable?

(2) The business competitive dynamics are changing. HXL historically benefited from having “great” composite materials, largely carbon fibre, and being able to charge premium pricing. However, in the last 10 years you’ve seen the moat surrounding these composite materials erode as competitors have entered the industry. Teijin, Toray, and Solvay are not the only competitors anymore (look more into Esterline’s Kirkhill division that was sold to TransDigm). Carbon fiber and other components are beginning to become a commoditized product – there hasn’t been any real innovation in the category in the last decade (HXL’s minuscule \~2.3% R&D % of revenue over the last decade supports this claim – you don’t need a huge R&D budget to create this product or innovate it). The real value in the OEM supplier industry is in engineered parts and components, where TransDigm and HEICO play. HXL’s vertically integrated business doesn’t mean much when the products are becoming commoditized. This also supports point number 1 – the OEMs will squeeze harder against these pureplay commoditized suppliers versus value-added highly engineered suppliers. HXL is likely to be hit with a double whammy of slower revenue growth because their products are becoming commoditized (the OEMs have more suppliers to pick from) alongside of margin contraction.

In my opinion, you should only look at sell-side assumptions after you have done all the work yourself. I think your valuation suffers from anchoring bias, it is predicated upon Goldman’s EBITDA margins and the only additional insight you added is “slower margin recovery”. Sell-side analysts are covering 20-30 names at a time and their own assumptions hug historical financials and management guidance, there isn’t a lot of thinking that goes into them. They focus on what the business is now, not how it and the industry will look like in 3-4 years. If you account for my arguments, 2024 EBITDA will be lower compared to your estimates due to a combination of slower revenue growth and margin contraction. Additionally, the market is unlikely to assign such a high multiple, as it did historically, to a now commoditized business being squeezed by it’s 2 largest customers that makeup \~64% of revenue. I agree with you the equity sold off more than it should have, however, I don’t think the base case IRR potential is 19.5%. My own valuation puts it around 8-10% which is a market CAGR.

Decent way to play what's likely and oversold airline sector with relatively limited risk

One suggestion would be to stress test covenants, and see how poorly the company would have to do to breach the covenants. I think they blow through the covenant in your bear case and are 10-20% off of it in your base case which limits their flexibility in the near term.

t3_g960yo,fosao2v,"Nice write up. I've had my eye on Hexcel as well, getting a similar fair value to you.

One of my big concerns is margin contractions over the long term. 

The aerospace industry in general seems to be very cost conscious, usually leaning towards the cheapest bidder. Composites is still relatively new, just recently in the past decade or so being viable for large scale manufacturing. So the competition landscape is still pretty small.

But, like any material based suppliers, eventually the gains on material and process improvement will become costly to the point that additional investments in R&D will be prohibitively expensive to continue maintaining a large competitive edge. And, generally, aerospace firms won't care as long as they see the benefits of weight reduction and can still certify the aircraft. So these composite suppliers will eventually have to start competing on price. 

If we look at a specialty metal company like Carpenter Technology Corporation (Ticker: CRS) that's in a more mature sector of the industry; their gross margins are closer to the 15% range, which is much less than the sporty 27% margins we see from Hexcel.

Hexcel is still the brand name in the industry, and if any supplier is going to maintain a majority market share, it'll be them. Also, as usage of composites continues to become more prevalent in new aircraft development, we might see revenue expansion offset margin contraction. So I still think they're a good buy.

To imply a valuation using only a FV/EBITDA multiple can be useful in a pinch, but you really ought to be supplementing your valuation with DCF anlysis, etc. 

A final nit with your valuation is that uses an FY 2024 EBITDA multiple that is entirely too high, and then does not discount that value back to today. Basically any company in Industrials that you can find will look attractive if you slap a 14x multiple on their 2024E EBITDA. Either you are using too high of a multiple, or you need to discount that value you are getting back to present day. To really put this in perspective, right now according to BB HXL trades at 9x 2020E EBITDA. Why on earth should it trade at 14x 2024E?

t3_g956kv,forby5u,">there are very few pure play ar/vr stocks and it’s pretty hard to find them. So I’ve decided to compile a list.

From my experience doing technical writing for pure VR/AR companies, most of them seem to be private money and based in Central and Eastern Europe. They're developing a lot of stuff for mobile. A few working with machine vision in combination with AR, too.

I'm not certain what agreements I have with which ones -- nor do I feel like looking -- so I won't be too specific or name names.

The best publicly traded company with VR/AR interests, BTW, is probably Microsoft with the Hololens. Apple and Google have AR exposure with their dev kits for iOS and Android, too.

To get into a pure VR/AR play, you'd probably have to be in venture capital at this stage.

A lot of lifestyle brands are paying smaller VR/AR-specific shops to create apps for them. Look at Warby Parker's doofy glasses try-on thing for a half-worthwhile example. I think Wayfair has something like that, too.

You may also want to look into machine vision, especially for manufacturing. A big untapped market coming on in the next 10 years is going to be machine vision systems to handle quality control, especially automating defect detection.

Truthfully, I think you're looking too much at consumer. Think manufacturing, medicine, and military.

t3_gdhtx5,fphgn63,"I’m bearish on Zoom but believe the key questions are:
- What is Zoom’s ability to convert free users to paid subscribers? Is Zoom locking in longer-term contracts now to support growth going forward? Or offering free trials?
- Can they solve their security issues? The company was not prepared for this level of growth and has some serious work to do. They’ve make hiring decisions (ex Facebook guy) to work on this.
- What does a normalized user base look like? I do not believe management is being dishonest, more misquote than anything. 
- Can they fend off competition against well-capitalized tech giants who are committing investment to Video (Microsoft Teams, Google, Facebook)?

- Increase in opex from additional investments in network capacity. Investors will focus on ability to grow paid user base (like Netflix) first and foremost and worry about profit later. For all we know, surge in revenue may more than offset incremental cost
- Recession. This is a pandemic-induced recession where we are forced to work from home or companies need to have a work from home solution. Zoom is enterprise focused, not individual, so I don’t believe a recession will really hurt Zoom. 
- Liquidity. Zoom has a lot of cash & cash equivalents. These are safe investments (typically not in equity markets). If anything, yield compression would have increased value of existing investments in the gov’t instruments, though yield was already low. 
- EPS. High growth companies typically aren’t even profitable. Thus, where they are generating net income at this point feels insignificant, particularly given recent growth this year. I would stray from trying to say because they had $10mm in net income (excl. interest income) off of 10mm people, then they need X net income and Y users to justify currently valuation. These businesses tend to be highly scalable (in other words, as users and revenue grow, the company’s ability to convert more $ in to $ profit increases as well). 
- Miscellaneous loan. Irrelevant and small
- Price at IPO vs price today. The company growth outlook is significantly different today than it was a year ago. This is not an apples to apples comparison.

Net Income Growth

2015 to 2019 = total of 3.5%, not CAGR

Adjusting for Trump tax cuts, down 9.3%

2016 to 2019 = total of 20.9%, not CAGR

Adjusting for Trump tax cuts up 7.1%

Trailing 12 month hasn't materially changed in 8 quarters.


EBITDA Growth

2015 to 2019 = total of -7.3%

2016 to 2019 = total of 8.4%

Trailing 12 month hasn't materially changed in 8 quarters and is actually below 2015 levels. There was a big jump from 2014 to 2015, but no growth since then.


EPS Growth

Ignoring the tax cuts, 88% of EPS growth since 2015 has come from buybacks. EPS in 2019 was $11.89. At 2015 shares earnings would have been $9.54. 2015 EPS was $9.22.

If you throw in the tax cut adjustment, with actual shares out EPS growth would have been a total of 13% from 2015 to 2019. Using 2015 shares out, it would have been a decline of 9.4%.


Free Cash Flow

2015 to 2019 FCF per share is up a total of 4.8%, no tax cuts and using actual shares out. Actual FCF is down 15.9%. It would be the same decline using 2015 shares out. It fluctuates quite a bit from year to year but hasn't materially changed since 2015.


Revenue

Up a total of 11.3% since 2015. A CAGR of 2.7%.


Conclusion

What I see is a company that has stagnated the last 4 years. Without the help of tax cuts earnings would be down and without the additional help of buybacks EPS would have hardly moved in those 4 years and would have been on a downward trend without the tax cuts. 

At the same time the share price has almost tripled, which isn't supported in any way by the fundamentals.

My take, it's significantly overpriced because there's been nothing to indicate they have miraculously now found the growth factor to warrant a 27x P/E. They've not grown for the last 4 years, what's new?

* You're assuming growth based on 4G, but how much of that was driven by the increase in % of people with smart phones? Can you assume the same growth now that 90%+ people already have smart phones?

You may be missing the forest for the trees a bit. 

You would get a MUCH greater return on your time if you get down to the 2-3 variables that truly matter for an investment and digging deep on those. Most often these variables have a qualitative aspect that will infer what ROIIC and reinvestment will look like 5+ years down the line.

In short, I would spend less time calculating 500 different ratios and more time looking at the handful of factors (these differ on a case by case basis) that drive 80% of price movement.

Few things:

1) Lose the inferiority complex. Nobody on here is an equity God. You have as much of a right to an informed opinion as anyone on this board.

2) The company has heavy insider ownership, and it appears one owner might have made some open market purchases in the past 6 months. (It might have been an RSU issuance -- I didn't take the time to dig in. Either way though, one inside owns 30% of the company; generally this is a very good thing.)

3) Convertibles, generally, tend to be issued in frothy bull markets (like we are arguably in today.) But, convertibles are generally a questionable deal for the investors who *purchase* them at face value; not necessarily a bad deal for the company's capital structure itself.

4) I invest in Hong Kong listed *Hong Kong-based* companies, generally. I get a little nervous, always, dealing with the fraud potential in Hong Kong-listed Chinese mainland companies. BUT... one thing I like to look for as an indicator of real earnings quality, is dividends and repurchases. You have both of those going for you here. 

5) Company trades at an EV-to-EBIT multiple of \~5. This is extraordinarily low for a company that has demonstrated growth the past few years. That said, I am totally ignorant of the stability of their revenue streams.

I will update the thesis after giving some of my views here. Some of the things (such a product breakdown, patent info) were things that I wanted to add... and then totally forgot to. Other things (corporate breakdown) were things I thought of adding... and then thought it would turn the post into a book and decided not to.

Moats, etc are things I don't place that much value on. Maybe that is bad... but logically I think that quality of management and competitive edge is quite obvious from the numbers. A company that doesn't thrive will not show exponential increases in sales and profit (with the exception of fraud). Coco-Cola, as an example, might have a great moat. Simply looking at the numbers makes that evident, if Coca-Cola didn't have a moat, their sales would have declined by a large amount thanks to all the generic ""knock-offs"" I see in the supermarket. That didn't happen (I was totally predicting the fall of Coca-Cola 20 years ago, boy was I wrong haha). I think the greatest kind of product is one where people have a choice of buying another, cheaper product, but they won't. Everyone can make Cola at home, but Coca-Cola doesn't seem to decline at all despite this.

ESTC is a tremendously complicated company with a highly non-standard pricing model, several products with multiple hosting, distribution and sales models. ESTC investors must make deep judgments around how observability and search play together, how much market share will flow to best in class point solutions vs cheaper platform offerings (i.e. how likely is it that an elastic search client with a high level of elastic expertise will also use their end point offering vs using CRWD, and how does that change over time) etc.. Also, evaluating the addressable market of ESTC is a very difficult question to answer - the markets they operate in are rapidly evolving, lack clear pricing structure and have highly individualised ROIs to companies. A company like Coupa or Autodesk that's digitalising a concrete and mature existing market is much easier to evaluate from that perspective.

Your revenue estimates don't have any reasoning behind them. ESTC growing 35% vs 25% is about how dependent they are on field sales vs bottoms up, how well their sales process translates to virtual, how much resource usage increases in their existing customer base, whether perceived ROI and criticality are strong enough to prevent a company cutting their IT budget from getting rid of ESTC, where in the priority list for CIOs in coronavirus are their various products and many other judgment calls. The company will give you a guide and you can figure out for yourself how conservative you think they are, but ultimately the market is constantly updating its opinion of how much this company will grow, and I would suspect that growth below 35% this year would be a disappointment and the stock would be materially down from here. If they hit your base case, I bet the stock is lower in 12 months (assuming market environment holds).

I also would suggest that 87 is a ridiculous bear case price considering it has traded below 50 fairly recently.

When a momentum stock loses momentum and misses earnings, in my experience, it is usually fatal. I am not a huge student of the stock/industry but, imo, they are at the point where they either do something (I don't know what) which rights the ship or this is going to go on for 5, 7, 10 years and is existential. The only bright spot is that the new CEO is someone who has been there a while, usually when the CEO switches they need a clueless outsider to step into the meat tenderiser...so maybe there is hope.

But the return on brain damage is usually minimal. I used to look at a ton of these situations (it is kind of where most people end up after they get jaded with net-nets and shitty low p/e stocks) and never saw any inefficiencies. Your upside is usually 30-40% at best, and you make that almost never (maybe 1 in 10 or 15).

I take the current FCF and project that out for 10 years. Then I assign a future EV/FCF multiple to year 10's FCF. If a company is currently trading at a high EV/FCF, then I'll normalize it downward. If it's trading at a low EV/FCF, then I might normalize it upward. (Clearly a lot of guess work in this step.)

Then I discount the future EV by 30% for a margin of safety to arrive at a rate of return number. If I feel my assumptions are rational and the rate of return is high enough to warrant the risk that my assumptions are wrong, then I invest.

I devised this method (not saying it's original) because I'm uncomfortable with how much of a DCF's value is determined by the Terminal Value's perpetuity calculation. I realize I'm trading one uncertain calculation for another, but I prefer assigning a future EV/FCF multiple over assigning a Terminal Value.

I remember that in the mid-2000s, my friend's family moved somewhere, then moved literally across the street within 1 year.  Soccer moms were thinking about buying up houses for investment.

I have not seen regular people getting caught in any of the so called bubbles since then.  Even Bitcoin, which many referred to as a bubble, never quite caught on with non-investors.  It had a boom and bust but wasn't a true bubble in my opinion.  I don't think we've had a true bubble since then.  I also don't think we are in one now.

t3_hkjn0t,fwxd9vy,"I was alive back then... depends on what you mean by ""around""? That era was when I was a teenager, the mania was real. Despite 99% of my time spent on video games and school, I still heard all about this from my family.

My family is like the most boomer of all the boomers that have ever boomed. They were ecstatic and thought they were absolute frigging geniuses. My stocks doubled again this year, I'm so awesome. Last month I made 10k, what did you make? Unfortunately, these boomers didn't just boom, they also went bust. We are talking well over a million down the drain from investing in companies with no earnings or even remotely sane amounts of sales for their price. The market giveth, and the market taketh away.

It seriously traumatized me to the point where I never thought about investing while I was open to it when young, and 2008 pretty much sealed it. Maybe that's a good thing too as I only dare touch stocks based on financial analysis rather than ""OMG it's going up!"". 

It's just the same thing over and over again. Bitcoin mania, gold mania, housing mania, tech mania, tesla mania, weed mania. It's just mass delusion hitting peak after peak. Sell before the peak hits because once it goes down nobody wants that trash anymore and it's all about the boring lame companies that nobody cared about. 

Around 3 years ago I started getting all these frigging random mails ""Invest in bitcoin!"" . They changed to ""Invest in this obscure crypto that is going to be the bitcoin boom all over again!"" indicating bitcoin is dead and will remain so. I get no African princes and princesses and pretty much only ""Buy random crypto"" and ""Hi my name is Stacey and I would like to meet you"". I want more African princes and princesses, damnit!

t3_hkjn0t,g0af8ri,"It think there is a a lot of difference in context between today and the dotcom bubble. It is probably impossible to explain but retail investing was a very different thing before the 80's and 90's so a lot of what was happening was new or in some sense hadn't happened since the 1920's. I remember the first stock that I owned, Raymond Corporation, an inheritance of about 15K in the very early 90's. It was with Merrill and I called up the stock broker (now called investment advisor I guess) to ask general questions about investing, evaluating stocks etc. Hahahahahaha.

Back then the individual retail investor really didn't have that much to go on while at the same time changes in the retirement savings picture along with deregulation of securities markets and the nascent internet were providing pressure for what has become an explosion of information and retail finance. The baby boomers had also come of age abandoning any tenuous anti capitalist ideas they might have had to become enthusiastic participants with money to invest. 

The 90's were an interesting time, neo liberal market worship really came into its own. The Soviet Union was dead, the end of history had come, things were different this time. The internet was a fascinating thing, it was obvious that somebody was going to make a huge pile off of it but no one really understood how. As the bubble took off it was a bit like crypto coin, if you appended .com to the end of a company name it was worth multiples of its real value. (sort of like ""dyne"" used in a prior era.) Along came online trading that simulated what ""real"" traders did and I suspect that in a world where a lot of the money that would have gone into pension funds now was in the hands of employees trying to figure out their future the bubble had the rocket fuel to take off.

Remember that this was a time when you could graduate with any liberal arts degree and get a job with a dotcom making 70k a year with your butt on an Aeron chair. This time surely it was different, right? Somehow it was going to be possible to do well by doing good...selling dogfood at a loss over the internet. 

You know the old saying ""the market can stay irrational for a lot longer then you can stay solvent""? Well maybe everybody knew it was a little crazy but nobody wanted to miss out. It was obvious something was changing fundamentally, like the invention of railroads or something. What I remember is that while it was clear that the internet was a big change I kept running into people that thought something like this had never happened before. I remember directly asking people if they didn't think that say...Electricity? or Railroads or Automobiles or Steel? hadn't had an equivalent seismic effect in their time and I never got anyting but a starry eyed ""no, of course this is different."" 

This ""Robinhood"" thing seems fundamentally different than the Dotcom bubble. I do not get any particular sense of optimism, rather a sense of Hail-Mary desperation or bro-ey sports betting finding an outlet. I read only a smidge of WSB with a thread along the lines of ask any questions RE options (or something like that.) It was appalling how absolutely ignorant the questioners were. This is not 1987, you can in seconds have ""Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options"" on your screen. If anything there is too much information about investing and speculating on the interwebs. I think that a lot of people are resigned, scared, see no particularly bright future in work and yet still feel vaguely entitled to a positive narrative of their life.

t3_hnm5na,fxdv9dw,"1. That's interesting idea, and I gotta say this is super refreshing (just discovered this, quite a contrast to wallstreetbets haha), please forgive my too long response
2. What timeline are you looking at? There tends to be tons of innovation during rough economic times (like now or 2009ish) and less during more stable times like the last 10 years. Necessity is the mother of invention, and invention is easier when the incumbents are having a rough time. So it seems like you either have to look very long term or find a way to handicap based on the economy.
3. I'm not sure if this helps but I don't think declining R&D is actually a good measure of innovation. Because a) over time it tends to cost less to innovate more, for example if you've heard that idea of software eating the world, it's way cheaper and often more impactful to innovate with software than with expensive hardware these days. and b) the most impactful innovations tend to come from low budget outsiders working in a garage or lab or something so it makes sense for VC's to get there first, while corporate innovation usually ends up being iteration. For example oil companies have had incentives to iterate better ways to extract or refine oil, but they were never going to disrupt themselves by innovating solar or something. Also like you mention in your last dot, companies tend to stay private for a lot longer these days before going public, so it seems logical to assume that public company RD would skew down. 
4. After rereading your hypothesis and my answer, maybe you kind of answered it yourself. Maybe just compare corporate R&D to VC spending? But keep in mind the early startup side is almost always going to be a much more efficient use of capital than corporate R&D, so it would be useful to know that ratio too.",5,1594263948,"[['VC', 1]]",VC,66.80999755859375,72.48999786376953

t3_hxo5n4,fz7l4zf,"This is complex but if you’re trying to boil it down to one thing I’d say:

- “Perceived execution ability”

Bulls will lay out a very grand plan for Tesla’s future that stretches out for the next 20 years which could lead them to be the biggest company in the world. 

The change in share price as I see it has been down to the perception of how likely Tesla can execute on these plans. Let’s assign them a probability of being able to execute on their plans between 0 and 1:

- In June 2019 Tesla was having ‘production hell’, massively overspending on building out door production lines and were at risk of bankruptcy. There perceived ability to execute on their plans was about a 0.05 say, and even possibly 0 by going out of business.

- In Nov 2019 2019Q3 earnings and the stock price rose massively because of a large earnings beat. This was very surprising at how little capex was spent in China and gross margins were very good. This suggested Tesla’s ability to execute was much higher than 0.05 and may be closer to 0.85 say. Analysts were obviously sceptical of this straight away and have been waiting for further evidence.

- Earnings results posted for 2019Q4, 2020Q1 and 2020Q2 further demonstrated Tesla ability to execute their plan at a much higher level than 0.05. Over this period Wall Street perception has trended up from 0.05 to 0.85 say. This is also complicated by S&P500 inclusion which encourages buying detached from the fundamental price and has probably caused frontrunning buying to make trading profits.


Conscious I’ve just assigned some made up probabilities but that’s the best way I thought I could get the explanation across. At the end of the day Tesla perceived ability to execute on their future plans has increased substantially over the last 12 months. IF they can execute on their very grand plans laid out by bulls then even though they are overvalued today, I suspect buyers at $1500 will be very happy.",20,1595696067,[],,,

1. Be careful when you cite “amazons intrinsic share value based on free cash flows”. I’m assuming you’re referring to a DCF you or an analyst built? There is literally no right answer for any company’s intrinsic value, only educated guesses, so i would not use my educated guess (amazons intrinsic value) to support another educated guess (gamestop’s) it becomes a very slippery slope.

2. why is there a comparison to amazon? what similarities am i missing for them to be a relevant party in this conversation? yes they are a part of the market, but they are hardly comparable

3. “Amazon has been unprofitable for a decade” yes, literally by choice. Bezos’ entire theme is aggressively reinvesting in the company. His profitability should not be used as a negative comparison, given that it was not a lack of ability to be profitable.

4. who uses liquidation value? ok cool, assets - liabilities is higher than share price. who gets first claim? you, the shareholder? lol, you’d be left on your ass in a bankruptcy situation, which again, liquidation value is only useful for. also, of those assets, how many are actually liquid? i’d assume they have shit tons of inventory that they’ve been trying to sell for a while now.

Downsizing is self explanatory, and as for compensation- really doubt it.

t3_i0eubv,fzqb3zl,"It may be undervalued, but if it continues to lose money, then the value won't be realized.

I used to invest in net-nets as Ben Graham called them. I did well measured by percentage return, but I'm not proud of it. I'm not proud of it, because it only worked on some of the stocks because there was another buyer that took it off my hands, but the stock went down further over time and cash wasn't realized. Not in all cases, but many. (There were some that went up and returned to profitability, but the situations are complex and not all will actually distribute the cash for various reasons.)

The issue is that you need to identify something that is undervalued, but also know when the value will be realized. Is management going to shut down a failing company? If not, and they just plan to bleed it out, then why will shareholders get anything?

I think net-net investing relies on not only a price, but also a catalyst. Each scenario is different, but one catalyst could be a controlling position. You have to own enough to force the liquidation unless management is willing to do it on their own.

This isn't a fun game and I (generally) gave it up a while ago. I'll still consider it if I really understand the situation, management's desire, and if there's a really big margin of safety, but it's been many years since those were in abundance. There is at least one CEO who I've identified that actually knows how to go in and ""clean up the house"" while winding up the operations. I'll trust him. He has no idea who I am, but I'll buy in if it makes sense and he's doing the same.",3,1596118430,[],,,
t3_i0eubv,fzqet7d,"You can search my post history to see comments on GME. 

On a separate note, I think there is a lot of confusion these days as to what ""net-net"" and ""Buffet cigar butt"" investing really is. People forget that the market was vastly more inefficient back in the 50s/60s when this strategy really worked. Back then, you could literally open up the Moody's stock manual and take your pick of opportunities. The important thing to highlight, is that back then you could find these companies trading at net-net levels that ***were still generating cash / positive EPS***. I don't think this point can be emphasized enough. When a company is growing book value the market should eventually converge the price with value, and occasionally you could step in to convince a stubborn management team to make a change (which is also something Buffet did). These days, you can still find companies trading below book value or net cash per share, whatever, but they are almost always shitty companies burning cash. The market prices them below book value because the market expects the company to continue destroying book value...so its the inverse, book value should eventually converge downward to the market price. In these situations you always need an activist to get involved to unlock cash or cause a change. Rarely are you going to find a situation so undervalued that it is actually worth an activists time (who want to 2x or 3x their money). You'd literally need to find a company trading for $0.30 that has $1.00 of net, clean cash and get someone in there to make a change quickly. 

For that reason I, someone who has been involved in an activist situation to unlock net cash, caution people attempting this approach. There is a lot more that goes into it other than just having a nice quantitative indication of value.",2,1596120353,[],,,

I was wondering why this stock has consistently trended downward. And for me, the answer is that stock prices are an indication of future performance, NOT current performance. Not even the next six months performance. More like a year, or years from now. And if you look past the next console releases, GME doesn’t seem to have a place in gaming. 

After people buy the new consoles later this year, they will buy all or most of their games online. There’s not a big market for game resale when you don’t own a hard copy. By the time we get to the next console releases, online shopping will be more common than it is now (and its already deadly for brick and mortar). We just won’t be going to GME.

In the case of AMD, it's P/BV & P/E are very high because there are very high expectations. The reason for this is Intel doesn't have a solid answer to anything AMD is producing and wont for at least the next 12-18 months, if not many years.

This will leave AMD dominate in the server, PC, and Laptop space for the foreseeable future. Their current earnings are not reflective of that reality yet and servers are typically purchased one once or twice a year, so you see a higher P/E ratio.

I'm also getting a P/BV of 35.19 ([$100B market cap](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMD/market_cap), [$2.842B in Assets](https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/fundamentals/balance-sheet?c4f94a53-ec3b-46ed-b81b-a9310fe6cebe%5Btimeframe_display%5D=quarter&c4f94a53-ec3b-46ed-b81b-a9310fe6cebe%5Bperiod%5D=current&c4f94a53-ec3b-46ed-b81b-a9310fe6cebe%5Bcompare%5D%5Bperiod_compare_one%5D=P1&c4f94a53-ec3b-46ed-b81b-a9310fe6cebe%5Bcompare%5D%5Bperiod_compare_two%5D=P1&url=)).

This further hits home the point, it's probably over valued.

That being said, AMD is gaining market share and as Intel becomes less competitive AMD can raise prices. AMD assets are up only \~$1B from last year.

That calculus will shift dramatically if they gain a dominate position in both market share and quality. More market share means larger runs (decreased price-per-unit), higher quality means increased prices. This should increase their gross margin.

If all of that is assumed to occur, it's quite possible their income will grow substantially. A 3-4x increase in profit will see their P/E and P/BV come more in line.

The cost to raise capital decreases for corporation which is another compounding factor. This has to be accounted for.

Overall viewership is down -40% YTD year over year. Fear the Walking Dead is the second most popular show for the network, but had a mere 420k 18-49 demo viewers, and is also down a whopping -46% YTD. There were just two other shows above 100k in this demo, and one of them is cancelled, and the other is doing it's final season next year (better Call Saul). Other than that, you have a bunch of literal crap that does not even hit more than 100k viewers which is... really, really, bad, to put it lightly.


Street has lowered next-12mo sales estimates a whopping 36% since early March. This looks safe from further downward revisions, but n12m FCF estimates look high: currently modeling 15.7% margin on $2.759bn in revenue. Probable downward revision risk coming in next few months. 

But, I don't even think this matters -- who will be hurrying to buy AMCX because they ""beat free cash flow by 5% and revenue grew 7%, not 2% people were expecting""--the inevitable is still coming: Growth will slowdown and I don't think this is a sustainable 15% FCF margin business as Street seems to be modeling...

The problem is these competing SVOD services now have more full content slates, unlike in '16 and '17.

Without giving you investment or business advice and going off your analysis only, my feedback would be:  


EPS - fundamental issue with your P/E analysis is that you have taken COVID performance (via your EPS) and applied a multiple to this. The street are factoring in a return to normality in EPS which in turn pushes up their willingness to pay vs your analysis.  


P/E - using any multiple you are making implicit assumptions about growth and discount rates (and in the case of a P/E assumptions around reinvestment rates). I think using historical averages can be a good guide as to how the market sees these things in the past but I would look to construct this yourself on a go forward basis given there has been a significant change in these variables. Secondly, my former point around EPS has a signficant effect on the P/E multiple, you are using a normal state of the world multiple with COVID earnings which is why your share price is so low.   


NAV Analysis - I think although a good sense check, the price this gives you is a bit academic in the context of a business like an airport. I would use to check against your target price in order to generate a P/B ratio. I always like to sense check the P/E I am using against P/B and ROE (noting that: P/E \* ROE = P/B). Breaking it down can always help you grasp the inputs in your analysis. For the same reasons, regularly check your ROE outputs through Du-Pont. 

Never used net / net so can't give any feedback. 

For the growth model: 1. (COVID EPS issue from above). 2. Not quite sure what your assumptions are but again sense check them how realistic do you think they are? A one stage model is incredibly inflexible. The next simplest version is to have a 2 stage model and more complex version is creating a DCF. This gives you the flexibility to change assumptions as the years go by.

I agree with your opinion that only a significant increase in inflation will prompt a rate increase. We are in a new paradigm where they are not explicitly targeting inflation (symmetrical average with no concrete range?) nor responding to full employment if we were to reach it. Also consider that there is so much federal debt that any major increases in interest rate would ruin the public sector.

We are currently in a bubble driven by 0% rates, quantative easing and a ""fed and treasury put"" so any signs of reversal will be immediately discounted by the market. Alternatively, if the market stays flat for 10 years we might grow into current valuations and the fed can gradually raise rates.

Edit: I guess I'll add. If you were to theoretically estimate the impact.

Same with Powell going from zero to two percent just recently. Look for that GMO piece called the idolatry of interest rates.

My opinion is that going to extremely high rates will crush a market as bonds become more competitive with stocks, but the current state of affairs is more narrative based than effect based.

t3_j494kf,g7jkxsi,"Two basic routes here.

First is parametric, which you can think of as a basic regression...some model in which we assume a parameter of Y, multiply by the change in rates, and then get some estimate of equity falling. You would have some parametric assumption about the relationship between the parameter, your dependent variable, distribution of error, etc. and you then estimate the parameter based on past data.

Second is non-parametric, you basically go back in history, find a time where this happened before, and look at what happened. You could compute this relationship using regression with only this period but most people (I think) just ""run"" their portfolio through this period. This is actually kind of complex in reality because say you own a security that didn't exist then, you have to work out correlation to something that did exist then, and then work out a fall, etc.

There is no real way to solve this problem (the crux of the issue is that things that have never happened before will happen in the future) but the non-parametric approach is usually preferred. Any kind of regression-based model is too tightly bound onto the past, your parameters are usually sensitive, it is hard to know what parametric assumptions to make, on and on, problems forever.

And btw, I know this answer doesn't stand up to scrutiny in most institutional contexts but the simple answer here is: you shouldn't care about these scenarios. Things that have never happened will happen in the future. You do all your calculations, you do all your spreadsheets, and then Covid or whatever happens...you are fucked. The actual solution is to make your portfolio robust so you are prepared for everything. Of course...institutions don't think this way, they hire lots of expensive consultants who do lots of bad but clever-sounding stats (they often do parametric stuff...somehow they still have jobs), and when the shit hits the fan they are long gone with the portfolio hemorrhaging cash like nothing else.

My view on reading investor letters is that they are a complete waste of time. This is a bit of a skeptical view, but I believe none of these funds ever share their best ideas in these letters. Those timely or great ideas are often shared with their LPs privately via e-mail, meetings, or calls. They know that the letters leak, and so there really is no wisdom to giving away free information to competitors. We have to remember that just like any other business, competition matters in asset management and nobody really wants to share \*valuable\* information with their competitors especially in a sector where informational advantage is so important.

Now some letters contain ""a window into the manager's thinking"" or a particular ""framework"" or ""mental model"" or whatever you want to call it for how these managers supposedly make decisions.  Again, I'm going to say something unpopular here which is that most of what they write is for them to signal or show that there is a logical sensible pattern to how they invest and that there is a methodical ""process"", which is something that LPs look for. So more so than anything else, sharing this type of thinking is for marketing purposes. Also noteworthy is that they don't necessarily operate on these frameworks all the time themselves - there is a lot of deviation, opportunistic stuff they do, etc, but they're not going to put that down in writing.  Those also happen to be where they generate the most alpha.

In my view, in any line of business, the information that really matters is never shared widely. That's why these letters to me are not so valuable, even though they seem to be written so well and with such clarity of thought and logical foundation that they leave the reader mesmerized and in awe.",19,1602304729,[],,,

t3_j9akfz,g8in97z,"No, it's not. Operating income is a very poor proxy for earnings in real estate because of depreciation. Real estate tends to appreciate at the rate of inflation over the long run, but GAAP accounting does not allow for recording these gains on the income statement. GAAP accounting does require buildings and improvements to be depreciated, which ends up depressing reported operating income and missing the value creation occurring.

Quick example. I'm a REIT and I buy an apartment complex for $100 million. To finance the deal, I borrow $60 million at 5%. In year 1, I get $12 million in rent and pay $5 million in cash operating expenses. I also report $4 million in depreciation. On the income statement, I report revenue of $12 million and operating income of $3 million. My interest expense is $3 million, so my net income is $0 million. Terrible! It looks like I am actually putting huge amounts of capital to work at a 0% return. But that's not the full story. My cash return is actually decent. I laid out $40 million (borrowing the other $60 million) and received cash flow of $4 million (because depreciation is a non-cash expense) for a 10% cash-on-cash return. That's not bad. And it can get a lot better if I am able to raise rents next year or increase occupancy.

But often the value of the real estate is likley rising, not depreciating down (especially during 2014-18). That's why FFO is a popular measuring stick instead of GAAP earnings. Maybe that explains the low ROIC in this chart?

But yea, whether it is a REIT, coca-cola or an oil company the question is, how much does the company invest into its operations, and how much cash does it make from that investment.

No doubt there is money to be made on recovery stocks - I guess it’s more a matter of which sectors will recover fastest and when the recovery will take its next leg up. Those are the two things I would pick at here before considering to start a position in Dufry.

1) Dufry specific: you mention current sentiment leans toward a swift recovery in travel...is this actually true when it comes to air travel? I used to think so, now I’m not so sure. 

Forget about the dangers of getting covid for a second and that we won’t be able to 99% safely fly for still another 6 months or year or so. I am referring to the demise of business travel. This accounts for what - 40-50% of all air travel? Do we really think companies will go back to in-person meetings all the time when zoom and Teams have worked so well? I’m not sure

Note that I guess this isn’t Dufry specific but more air travel (likely hotels as well)

2) Recovery Timing: here is more of a short-term thing. I have been in many recovery stocks and sold many off this week after the big vaccine news. I think it’s likely we are going down more before riding the next wave up - with the European lockdowns, US cases, etc. I don’t see positive catalysts in the coming weeks.

Not saying this applies to you but I think many market participants in the stocks you mentioned are stopping after a review of how strong sales will be. Without trying to figure out whether or not the positive sales outlook is already priced in (and more) by the market valuation of the stock concerned one can't have conviction that one has an edge. 

In my opinion pretty heavy optimism about sales is already priced in to the valuations of the stocks listed in the post. Over the longer term people buying at these valuations are risking losing a large share of their money unless the future is even brighter than the bright prospects already priced in. Over the short term of course anything can happen. 
 As the old adage goes, 'a greater fool' may come along who shareholders can sell to at an even higher price.  However if the original purchase price was overvalued, any resulting profits from a sale to such a 'greater fool' would be from what Ben Graham characterised as speculation rather than investment. 

I think it's an interesting reflection on the state of the market today that people who commented earlier pointing out that valuation and earnings matter got down voted - and this in a thread named after Ben Graham's book! After an unusual 10-year stretch of underperformance for value investing, there aren't many true value guys left standing.  They've been getting swamped by momentum type speculators who focus on sales growth and not fundamental value (by fundamental value I mean comparing the net present value of future distributable cash flow per share vs the share price).  Again not saying that's you - I have no idea whether or not it is - but I think those types of speculators are driving the stock prices of the stocks you listed while this growth/momentum/cloud/tech bubble lasts. The timing of a bubble bursting is always impossible to predict but I don't see this ending well - the speculators can't all rush through the exits at once.",6,1605848464,[],,,

\- Management is definitely clueless. CMO made $3M while they paid consultants to tell them what business they should be in. Company definitely lacked direction.

\- They tried moving into homegoods and mattresses. Good market, but filled with strong competitors. 

\- Poured capital into store renovations with no increase in sales.

\- COVID has been a big boost for them. 

\- They were open to activists and sold property rather raising debt.

\-They wisely stopped wasting money on renovating stores (temporarily?).

The only input to the algorithm was the raw pixel data and then it's told if it won or lost at the end of the game, that it.

Leave the algorithm playing for a little while and it's able to understand the objective of the game and come up with winning strategies, completely from the raw pixel data alone and self-play.

It was able to do this with nearly *60 different games* that are very different from each other, and perform better than top human players in almost all of them.

An algorithm that is this generalized can be applied to so many problems that the earning potential is huge imo. Probably the most impressive algorithm ever created.

I think first the performance of which these models are growing might be about 4x-10x every 2 years, way above Moore's laws. The reason being is that the models aren't limited by CPU cycles like Moore's law, they are limited by how well can training be parallelized on the cloud, and how much money someone is willing to spend to train a model. The first initial breakthrough in deep learning, AlexNet, was able to use parallel GPU cycles, and took 6 days to train. I imagine the total cost for something like this couldn't be more than $5000 dollars.  Recently a deep learning breakthrough in NLP, GPT-3, costed about 5 million dollars to train. I think in the future this trend is only going to continue, and I really don't see why things thought of as previously impossible, could become possible after 10 years, and AI could be 100000x better than what it is today. I mean if in 2030 Google could spend $5Billion dollars on a training for an AI that could be 1000x better than GPT 3 that could code a better google, why wouldn't they do it? 

I think in order to win ML, you need a mix of talent to setting up the training to fit to the problem you need, and brute force amount of money to spend on training. If it is the case that whoever has the talent, and will to spends the most money will win the AI game, then GOOGL seems the most poised to take it all.

t3_k8sll7,gf17kkx,"So I’m no expert on this topic but I’ve actually given this (or at least part of this) some thought before. Specifically, I was trying to quantify a short squeeze for any given security to potentially capitalize on any funds flow predictability that maybe could be gleaned. My thought was to take a time series of short interest in any given stock and use the period over period increase in short volume as a proxy for estimating the # of shorts at a certain price (could just take the avg price or vwap over whatever period your measuring the short interest delta over). This is obv imperfect since there will be overlap in people closing out shorts and entering new shorts in any quoted short interest volumes, but my logic is that if you do it over a long enough time horizon, since all shares hypothetically start with 0 short interest, the delta can only materially increase over the LT and assuming the float generally increases over time (which is typical over long periods), your short interest should also proportionally grow over time. So yeah, do this for a long enough period to get a “weighted avg short price” for any given historical period (Nasdaq publishes reports twice a month so those are prob the best stocks to do this on). Then check how short interest changes pre- and post-rally of a stock’s price. Do this for a couple historical periods (ideally ones where your stock rally $ chng vs weighted avg short $ is similar) and I think you could back into a rough % the stock price has to rally to have the shorts cover (or at least are likely to cover within w/e probably distribution the historical periods give you). Obviously I think the % stat would be stock-specific since you’re basically shock testing the investors’ liquidity and risk management approaches, both of which I doubt will be very homogeneous across diff issues. There are prob way better ways of doing this and I’m not even sure this addressed your question, but even if not maybe someone can chime in for my own edification to tell me what obvious thing I’m overlooking.",2,1607412140,[],,,

With Performant about to release earnings mid-March, I think now is a good opportunity to discuss the company again. This stock has recently been written up, the company is in the midst of a major turnaround in which their medical audit/recovery business segment continues to grow while accounting for an increasing percentage of their revenue. Link to original post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/ki8z2q/pfmt\_performant\_financial\_boring\_business\_but\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/ki8z2q/pfmt_performant_financial_boring_business_but_a/)

This post will not cover the same points as the previous, though I encourage new/existing readers interested in 3-5X upside to read the original DD post. This update is to emphasize the importance of PFMTs growing medical reimbursement business by clarifying the reimbursement process. Keep in mind as you read this that US healthcare spending was about $4 trillion in 2020 and is expected to be $6 trillion by 2027. Also, consider how quickly medical technologies are advancing. Imagine how digital multi-sensor contact lenses, 3D medical prosthetic/drug/organ printing, robotic surgery, new imaging tech, faster clinical trials, robot assistance, brain-computer interface and DNA customization will redefine our lives. The mass of adoption of such technologies will no doubt shock the bureaucratic coding, claiming and reimbursement processes of the world thus requiring companies like PFMT to provide dedicated expertise that in-house tools cannot handle alone. With ever rising healthcare costs in the US, reimbursement is only likely to increase in importance with the potential for a faster pace of change as well. Understanding reimbursement is a critical part of medical tech/IT investing. There are and always will be changing pressures on healthcare so it is safe to assume there will be ongoing change and nuance to this process. The US process is complex and the triggers that cause commercial/government payors to implement change are not well understood by in-house teams. Successful navigation of the reimbursement process in the US requires interactions with multiple large organizations including government regulators (CMS), large physician run societies and commercial insurers. All of which PFMT has existing contracts and relationships with. And like any other process that demands interaction with multiple large organizations: focus, persistence and having proper strategy is what matters significantly .

The first step in attaining reimbursement for medical service is to ensure appropriate coding. Coding is the standard cost identification system used by MCS, healthcare providers and third party payors and is the link between coverage an payment. The existence of an official code facilitated the entire process as it is a formal recognition system. A code does not guarantee reimbursement from a payor but it is a critical step in the standardized process. Coverage and payment for non-coded services is possible but that process is far more difficult, manual and time-consuming. Given the broad range of health-related events that might happen to a given patient, there are a vast array of codes and types of codes that exist to describe everything from where a procedure was performed (inpatient/outpatient setting or at home), who performs it (physician, nurse, tech) and the type of equipment/procedure involved (equipment, consumables or medical technologies). By analyzing these codes, payors are able to make informed reimbursement decisions based on symptoms of patient and procedures performed.

These codes can be broken down further into multiple categories, each with more complexity. For the sake of this piece, it is only important to understand that with such a complicated coding system doctors may be hesitant to use certain codes or simply may not be familiar with all the nuance, this raises concerns over whether or not they will be paid for the services provided. These concerns and natural ambiguity provides opportunity for PFMT to reclaim improperly coded services and collect a fee in the process.

In theory, you would expect experienced teams of large payors to understand all codes and handle them accordingly. In practice, payors can often be so inundated with new applications that they cannot fully and appropriately give fair and full reviews of claims so there is tremendous amount of leakage in the system.

Side note: This stock always starts to run higher into earnings releases. The last quarter had the unfortunate timing coinciding with layoffs and fund closures at top shareholder (filings confirm this). Hence there was selling pressure but not due to any fundamental reason related to PFMT operations. The stock is still trading at extremely depressed prices. In this market it should be trading at the best case scenario $5.15 per share. Investors will start to see the potential in this name and accumulate positions. Not only that, but from a broad market perspective, many sectors and particular names are getting to be at very overvalued frothy levels. It is not unreasonable to see a rotation out of growthy large cap tech names into deep value. Anyone shorting PFMT will get squeezed hard. It is still a relatively unknown name, this is a great entry point. Please comment with questions and thoughts!",3,1613442561,"[['PFMT', 5]]",PFMT,0.7799999713897705,0.9200000166893005

So while there are criminals who use it because it allows pseudonymous transactions, blockchain analytics companies can easily deanonymize most transactions. Bitcoin will be a rich source for proving crimes in the future I guarantee it. Cash has a FAR better use case for crime than Bitcoin.

I think the main thing people here are missing about Bitcoin is what it is. Bitcoin is a neutral settlement network that no one controls. Bitcoin (or Sats) is just the quanta that allows you to use the network. The fact that no one is in control means that it operates on consensus and its rules are very difficult to change. And you don’t need anyone’s permission to use it. Compare this to CBDCs which are fully under control of the government. They can print as much CBDCs as they want—but it also allows them to do some real Black Mirror shenanigans turn your money off if your social credit score gets too low. This is not possible with Bitcoin(BTC). Again, the rules of BTC are hard to change (ie # BTC is fixed) and it doesn’t require anyone’s permission to use.

Regarding payments I encourage people to look at companies like Zap and their [Strike App](https://strike.acinq.co). Square is supposedly working on something similar. They have created a simple to use UI that allows anyone to send micropayments using the lightning network (LN). LN allows vendors to aggregate payments from customers and settle them on the BTC blockchain for minuscule cost per transaction. Using LN you can send payments worth a fraction of a cent!—try doing that through your bank/cc. Ultimately I think LN will be used as the rails for fiat to fiat transactions and people will not even realize they are using BTC in their transactions. Companies like Visa and MC will either have to adopt it or cease to exist because it offers settlement an order of magnitude cheaper that the current usurious rate they charge vendors.

Finally, people who criticize proof of work (Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism) and think proof of stake(PoS) is the solution need to look at PoS networks and their propensity to become centralized, especially via exchanges. I was a big believer in PoS but have yet to find one that breaks down because it allows stakers to collude and cheat. Anyone who thinks Ethereum is decentralized should google ‘ice age Ethereum’ and see just how easy it is to change. The changeable nature of Ethereum means it is bad money but I think it has numerous other use cases.

Bitcoin is even less than a zero sum game. If one person makes $100K and one loses $100K, the winner pays taxes on his profits.

Bitcoin is being hyped and pumped by a crowd I call the Cayman Islands Crew. Max Keiser, Raoul Pal and others. They're front-running their own credibility. You can be sure they loaded up before their coincidentally concerted campaign to boost the price. Bitcoin languished for years. It would be naive to assume it suddenly and organically got attention.

Bitcoiners keep conflating their digital marker with things like Tesla and gold because, like a vine that climbs a tree, it has no support of its own. There are no fundamentals behind it. It's a number on a screen. Gold doesn't compare itself to anything else. It doesn't need to.

Central banks and institutions don't hold BTC because it's too erratic and if it's some analogue of gold to hedge against the USD then why not just hold gold? BTC swing 5% a day. No serious investor would put a significant portion of their wealth for storage in something like that.

Bitcoiners talk out of both sides of their mouths about the merits. One the one hand they say that it's anonymous and secure so it's a tool for privacy but if you address the issue that it's used by criminals like pedos, hackers, drug dealers and money launderers, they suddenly say that every transaction is traceable and no-one has ever been defrauded by Bitcoin. Which is it?

Bitcoin was originally conceived as a payment system but it failed. The cost, time and energy to process each transaction made it time-unwieldy, expensive and flawed due to its erratic value. But now it's suddenly morphed into a currency unit? Adherents were *so* assured of its merit as a unit of exchange but now they've seamlessly changed track to it being some vague USD hedge.

There's massive sovereign risk with BTC. e.g I'm guessing there's many corrupt government officials in a swathe of countries who could use BTC to extricate their finances out to foreign lands. How long before any one of these countries declares Bitcoin illegal?

I suspect there are millions of people trading BTC who think their profits are tax free or who think the govt won't notice them making money on BTC trades. That will be an interesting issue come tax time.

t3_kjtge5,ggywpwm,"I feel like you are pretty off in almost every angle through which you’re viewing Bitcoin. 

Let’s start with the easy one. Central bank digital currencies are not a threat to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the pushback on central bank money printing (inflating the dollars in circulation, thereby devaluing every dollar in circulation). A CBDC would just be a much easier way for central banks to debase your currency. They could create $1 trillion with the push of a button. Bitcoin is programmatically set to limit the number of coins in circulation. The amount will never increase more than the already agreed upon number. This makes it impossible to devalue Bitcoin based on unintended inflationary pressure. 

Most hardcore Bitcoin investors do not believe Bitcoin will ever be used for payment processing. The blockchain can not handle that number of concurrent transactions. Unfortunately, in order to increase the number of transactions, you would need to increase the block size - which in turn would decrease the level of security due to less nodes being run. Maybe that sounds confusing, but the basic concept is that Bitcoin is probably not a payment processing network as it stands today. But that doesn’t matter. Bitcoin has a much higher purpose. It will likely be the reserve currency of the world. The US dollar is currently the main reserve currency. No major fiat currency, including the US dollar is pegged to any source of value. The US treasury printed 25-35% of all the dollars ever in existence in one month in 2020. All of this is to say that governments around the world are abusing their authority to print endless dollars. This is already having an impact on real inflation and value of dollars everywhere.  Just look at interest rates. They’ve been hovering around zero for nearly a decade - because that’s the only way for governments to make it appear the middle class is doing better. In order to keep the bullshit train rolling, there is only one answer - negative interest rates. Can you imagine paying your bank each month to hold your money? No? Me neither. Why wouldn’t those people all put their money in Bitcoin at that point? 

Another possible outcome for Bitcoin is that it is used as a better alternative to gold, for storage of value. Gold is really a very poor choice to use as a storage of value. 1. It is not divisible - or at least not easily by any means.  2. Gold is incredibly hard to store securely. Do you want to hold $100k gold bar in your home? Not me. 3.  It has competing value - it’s used in many manufacturing processes. A lot of people see this as a negative vs Bitcoin, but many people view it as a positive for Bitcoin. Bitcoin has one use - as a store of wealth. That makes it much more efficient to value. No competing end uses. 

Basically, Bitcoin has a place in the investing world because investors increasingly don’t feel comfortable putting their cash in much of anything else. As this continues to accelerate, it will be a cyclical process - dollars and gold will continue to lose value while Bitcoin value increases.  That’s how I see the landscape at least.",13,1608877414,[],,,
t3_kjtge5,ggz51u8,"I think people struggle to understand Bitcoin because it is truly new asset class. Its hard to understand something that is brand new so people try to compare it to something that already exists and then it kind of doesn't make sense. I think Bitcoin is a new asset class that shares qualities of currency and gold but it is not one or the other. Its both at the same time. Therefore, you can make payments with it and use it as money. And yes its not widely used now but I think its not a strong argument against it because technology always take some time to be rolled out to wider public (think the internet, EVs, phones before and now). Also because of its builtin scarcity you can use it as storehold of wealth. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin is much more convenient and you can still use it as currency. 

Regarding alternative coins, I think mistake people make is comparing every single crypto to Bitcoin. However, I don't think we will live in the world where there will only be one crypto that ""won"". Each one is made for specific purpose and you have to compare them in that context. As in, it makes no sense to compare Bitcoin and Dai, or Dai and Etherium. Its like comparing a bike and a car and saying that one is better so lets never use the other.

I think Cryptocurrencies and decentralized payments are super interesting, and certainly useful say if you're fleeing inflation in Venezuela, but even then I'd prefer something like Libra.",2,1608923350,[],,,
t3_kjtge5,ggzfth5,"Maybe it's important to state that Bitcoin is not a security, so its value cannot be analyzed using traditional security valuation models. Stating this since we are in r/SecurityAnalysis and it may throw many people off. It's better seen as a commodity. 

I will leave here a few thoughts:

For any valuation of a commodity to be sustainable there needs to be a use case that drives its demand as valuation of a commodity is driven by supply and demand, (so is valuation of everything else but in the case of securities there is also the cash flows to which we are entitled that justify a valuation). 

Pure Store of Value use case is not sustainable by itself. That is to say, if the only use case of a commodity is store of value then its valuation is just a big collective greater fools game. And may collapse at any point in the future, the game can go for a very long time though as long as there keeps being newer fools sustaining the demand. 

At a minimum Store of Value needs Transfer of Value too to be a sustainable use case. Bitcoin satisfies this at the moment, as it can be used to transfer value. Gold is possibly the biggest classical example of this type of commodity (there is also a bit of industrial use but it's possibly negligible towards its valuation).

The long term prospects of the Transfer of Value use case of Bitcoin look dire to me. Bitcoin developers have decided not to scale at layer 1. Its capabilites to transfer value are well understood technically and are simply insufficient for mass use. Transaction fees will have to keep going up to compensate the lack of transaction throughput, as transaction fees go up the transfer of value becomes progressively disincentivized for more and more uses. 

Due to cryptoeconomics that I won't go into in this post (it would be a bit long to explain), there are important long-term security concerns to any Proof of Work blockchain that cannot obtain a sufficient security budget via transactions. The network can become economically viable to attack thus taking down the pure Store of Value use case. 

Some of these points may take decades to play out but it's important to understand them as to not be caught in the musical chairs game. 

It's interesting to contrast these points with a Proof of Stake blockchain. Agreeing with OP, Ethereum has a much brighter economic future. This may take decades to play out as the writing on the wall becomes more widely understood. It took 13 years for Institutional Investors to start understanding Bitcoin, it may easily take them another decade to understand how it's flawed long term.",4,1608899622,[],,,
t3_kjtge5,ggyvgkt,Don’t underestimate the market for crime. But yea BTC as a currency outside of crime is a meme. Deflation is horrible for a currency.,3,1608876330,[],,,
t3_kjtge5,ggz46oq,"I agree with you fully. 

It's essentially gambling at this point with no fundamental way to value or analyze it. 

Someone in this thread is arguing its a way to prevent major currencies from being ""devalued"" by central banks. CBs print money and also buy back bonds per monetary policy and as a reflection of the state of the economy. 

They aren't some evil organization hellbent on devaluing your savings. 

Hardcore bitcoin believers are basically conspiracy theorists.",4,1608885061,[],,,
t3_kjtge5,ggznsde,"I think reality tends to distort things created by humans. I have not heard of many businesses whose end forms bore a very close resemblance to what the creator originally intended.

Just like other businesses, Bitcoin will go the same way. I don't think it will ever be a currency, because there are too any negatives for that.

Apart from that, I can't really say anything about it. I don't think it will ever be a proper store of value too because there is fundamentally nothing special about it - there are plenty of other such currencies.

For example, there is no moat to speak of, and the actual adoption rate is very low. I've even seen graphs for adoption, and how Bitcoin is at the beginning of the curve, and how those curves supposedly resemble the curves for railways, electricity or something similar.

But essentially, all pro-Bitcoin people are trying to predict the future, which is not possible. They are not presenting cases where the same adoption rate curve did not work out, so a lot of bias there. I would be very interested in seeing what else the pro-Bitcoin people have predicted successfully, which I'm sure they haven't (even a broken clock is right twice a day).

But I'd stay out of it just for the reason that there are other very well defined ways to reasonably grow money, or at least protect it. Just today, I think somebody could sink their money into companies like Amazon, Nvidia and Facebook and wait for the next 3-5 years.

As for institutions buying it... I think it is just greed, regardless of whether it is a sound investment or not.

There is no doubt that Bitcoin will make a lot of people rich... but so did the tulip mania.",2,1608907388,[],,,
