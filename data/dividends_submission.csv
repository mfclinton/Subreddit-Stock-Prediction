t3_6gy834,Dividend Investing Through These Two Investments,"In today’s article, we are going to talk about the best way to invest your money. I’m not going to bore you with tons of facts, figures and examples. But rather, give you a fast and quick method on how to invest your money right, the fast way the right way.

STEP 1 Now let’s get one thing straight, if you are in debts; that is, if you still owe money to a bank, to a person, to whatever entity, you got to pay it down first. Especially debts with high interest rates. Pay them off as soon as you can! Once you are ‘relatively’ debt free (I highlight the word relative because I leverage on low interest debt to invest-more details on this later) you will need to

STEP 2 Automate your savings account. Why? Well because it is the best way to help you financially deal with the uncertainties of life (such as job loss or medical expenses) and give you ammunition to achieve your financial dreams (pay for college, purchase a car, travel, or save for retirement).
Remember to pay yourself first! Depositing money into a savings account should take priority over any additional spending.
Here are some ideas to help: 
· As you pay your monthly bills, set money aside to deposit into your savings. 
· Ask your bank to automatically transfer money from your checking to your savings once or twice a month. 
· Request a direct deposit from your employer for a portion of your paycheck to be deposited into your savings account.

Make sure you are not spending more than you earn and that you are able to save money every month. Ultimately, you should maintain a balance that would at least cover six to 12 months of your expenses. Small amounts add up and make a difference over time.

STEP 3
Start to ride on the power of compounding. I am talking about real investing. Not trading, not finding the next best stock or company that promises to give you huge returns and if it doesn’t you dumb it away…no.
Too many investors have spent too much time trading and trading (in my opinion) usually lose out in the long run.
So what is ‘riding on the power of compounding actually mean? Allow me to give you an example
If you have bought Vanguard 500 Index fund (VFINX) and held this etf for the 20 years ending March 15, 2017.

A $10,000 investment capital outlay in March 15, 1997 would have grown to a value of $42,700 at the end of the 20-year period. This assumes the reinvestment of all fund distributions for dividends, interest or capital gains back into the fund. Without reinvesting the distributions, the value of the initial $10,000 investment would have grown to $29,040 of the amount with reinvestment.

Let’s look at more examples,
A 25-year-old who wishes to accumulate $1 million before age 53 would need to invest $1000 each month assuming a constant return of 7%.
A 35-year-old wishing to accumulate $1 million by before age 60 would need to invest $1,500 each month using the same assumptions.
A 45-year-old would need to invest more per month in order to hit $1million before 60 and so forth.
Having seen all these examples, what does it mean to be actually riding ‘on the power of compounding interest’? It implies the following [very important part] You need to find an investment that is 
· Easy to understand 
· Easy for you to manage its risks 
· Able to give back to you consistently
And you need to · Be disciplined enough to reinvest the returns 
· Start as soon as you can (more time for your investments to grow and weather the ups and downs of the stock market and economy)

STEP 4 The next question you should be asking is, what investment opportunities are out there that is easy to understand, easy to manage and able to give back to you consistently? They are 

· Index ETFs 

· REITs

Look no further then these two investment opportunities. Why? Well because these investment give decently high CONSISTENT returns and their risks are easily managed. Different investment options offer different rates of return. Generally, the higher rate of return has higher the chance of losing your investment (the lower the rate of return, the lower the chance of losing your investment dollars) but with REITs and Index ETFs, this equivalent exchange of high return high risk can be adjusted to your favour, if you put in the find exceptional Index ETFs and top REITs to put into your portfolio.

How to find exceptional ETFs (see here: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-choose-best.asp)

How to find exceptional Top REITs (see here: https://www.udemy.com/reits-investment-money-masterclass/?couponCode=GSSDEAL)

And that’s all. Follow these 4 steps on you’re well on your way to financial freedom.

Last month I made $92 in dividends. You can see that it is clearly a big leap forward. My goal for 2019 is to get to the point where i'm consistently making over $100 in dividends per month. So far I haven't crossed the mark into $100 yet.

For context. Here is my portfolio value over time on a monthly basis. Keep in mind that this is with significant contributions. The reason it increased in value in the past 3 months is because I have put in thousands to it each month.

t3_ahe8ef,Creating Your Own Monthly Dividend Portfolio Using Popular Dividend Growth Stocks,"Hey guys,

My first post here (I think?)

I'm sure many people on this sub are some what attracted to monthly dividend paying stocks. So I thought, since different stocks pay out dividends on different months, what if we bought just the right ones so that we're getting a dividend payment from *somewhere*, every month. 

After all, if we have total monthly expenses of, let's say...$2,000, then it'd be sweet if we somehow earned $2,000 per month in dividend payments to cover that, wouldn't it? 

So we can build a portfolio of stocks with staggering monthly dividend payments in order to achieve this $2,000 per month. 

**So Here's What I Did:**

To start building this portfolio, my main criteria was that it should be a strong solid stock from stable, mature companies. 

I decided to look at [VDIGX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VDIGX) since it's the Vanguard Dividend Growth fund. 

From here, I picked out the top 25 performing stocks (which I've written about [here](https://www.financeoholic.com/dividends/dividend-stocks-portfolio/)) over the last decade and decided to build a portfolio containing just these stocks. Now I had to figure out how many of each of these stocks I should buy in order to have a consistent monthly dividend payment. This became a basic Optimization problem, which Excel can handle pretty easily.

To do this, I created a schedule of all the dividend payments by month. This was done by creating a table in Excel. With this table, I ran Excel Solver and it spit out the number of shares I would have to buy of each stock from the Top 25 stocks of VDIGX. 

The resulting spreadsheet looked like this:

I'm still fairly a beginner using Excel Solver and identifying constraints. So if anyone knows of more tricks out there, I'm open to listen. My spreadsheet can be downloaded here if you want to play around with the table:

One constraint was ""no stock can be more than 7% of the portfolio"". Again, another arbitrary number, but a number I felt comfortable with so that there isn't one stock that overweighs completely over the rest.

The results were as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/7h19iy202ke21.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=62244d450d857c582b452b98b49344ec2c8d3182

Many of the shares are in fractional amounts but we can use our own discretion as to whether we want to round up or down.

I noticed that Solver said to allocate the least amount of capital to OHI, probably because it has a lower monthly dividend yield than the rest.

I also didn't realize that GAIN and GLAD are probably the same company so there's some overlap in risks.

I've written about the entire process and post here: [Monthly Dividend Income Portfolio](https://www.financeoholic.com/dividends/monthly-dividend-income-portfolio/) if you want to read more and download the Excel spreadsheet I used.",48,0.97,1549288245.0

t3_anezm0,Free Trades,"Dividenders,

I am totally on board with growing this sub, so I’m gonna ask this here instead of in another investing sub. Thanks everyone for trying to keep the dividend dream alive.

I’ve been trying to figure out why people use RobinHood or M1? I’ve never checked them out and honestly don’t know what they do. However, a friend at work asked me what I use, and when i said Merrill Lynch he laughed and said “well i get free trades.” 

Is that why people use it? Or are there other benefits? I ask because I opened my scottrade account in 2012 and have executed a trade every other week (payday) ever since and have never paid a fee. I also drip monthly dividends, so have an additional 6-10ish automatic free trades a month. I moved to Merrill when Scottrade was bought by TDAmeritrade cuz it looked cool to have everything in my BOA account. They don’t even make me ask anymore, free trades in perpetuity.

Anyways, I started at Scottrade with $250. When I wanted to execute a trade, I called them and asked for a few free trades to help me get started and they always said yes. I did this for years. If you just tell the truth, the truth being that if they don’t give you free trades you will move to another broker, they will probably say yes.  

I recently read a post on here where someone is manually reinvesting in GAIN, so if these brokers don’t allow for DRIPing, I’d considering moving to another broker because you will miss out on hella fractional shares. Hella. Fractional. Shares.",4,0.84,1549379436.0

I am 15 years old, so compounding would be even more useful because I will spend more time in the market. I'm starting to invest now because I like the idea of passive income and making my money work for me. Anyways, below are the stocks that I want in my portfolio:

GPC

STOR

CINF

GAIN

VZ 

HRL 

PG 

CAT 

PH 

AWR 

MSFT 

MMM 

JNJ 

&#x200B;

I chose these stocks because most of them have been giving dividends out for more than 25-50 years, and I will be getting a dividend every week or two. Obviously, this portfolio isn't perfect, so if there are any suggestions you would like to make, please tell me!

&#x200B;

MSFT - 0 shares - $0.00

MMM - 0 shares - $0.00

JNJ - 0 shares - $0.00

&#x200B;

I just started, and I've decided to put 5,250 into one stock at a time. I haven't gotten any dividends yet, but I should be able to DRIP 3-4 shares a year. I will buy a few more HRL in the following months, and then one of the REITs or JNJ. Do you have any input?

I hope more redditors start posting monthly updates of their own too. I think it'll make the subreddit much more enjoyable and less...dead. Have fun collecting dividends!

He said you should at least trim your position after you are up by 50-70%.  I know for sure  market crash is coming in end of 2019 and 2020.  

I was thinking shoulder I trim some of my dividend position & buy utilities ETF (vanguard, $SO, etc) And Buy more (of whatever I sell in next month of two) when market is down.

I am thinking... if i sell CSCO & VFC Now, I will buy later in 2020 when market corrects/crashes. 

what you guys think is the best strategy of stock holdings once you are up by more than 50% of original value? 

please comment, advice.

t3_b9ub2v,Tax questions for dividends.,"Really interested in making my portfolio more dividend based, but had a few questions about taxes before doing so.

Are reinvested dividends taxed?

If I were to say take out half of the dividends as income and then reinvest the other half would the taken out dividends be taxed as highly as income?

If the dividend stock is held for over a year and I start using that to supplement my income, does that then count as capital gains tax?

How do REITs play into this?

So my plan was to switch everything over to mostly dividends, and for the next year fully reinvest them back in, then after that take out half to put into savings/income and reinvest the other half. Is this a viable strategy?

t3_bam6ot,Risk of dividend investment,"Good day.

Recently decided to move toward long term dividend investment to utilize the power of compound math. Also as a experience preparation to build profolio for growing up kid (to TFSA).

One thing I don't understand well about ""risk"" many articles mentioned. And I haven't seen any of the article mention a real example about the consequences of the risk.

Take an example, ChemTrade. It seems the company consistently issues monthly dividend and never missed a month in about 2 decades. Although the stock price itself has up and down as usual. And there seems debts as well as long term situation. But I don't understand what exactly the risk many articles mentioned. Does it simply a fear that this company won't able to keep issue dividend someday?

Would you share one or few happened dividend investment disasters? Such as company bankruptcy, no more issue dividend ...etc.

Thank you.

t3_bdmdvj,Options Dividend Capture Strategy,"Hello all, Just joined the group as I have started making some divi options trades and wanted to know if anyone else is doing the same.

There are a couple of variations:

1) Buy the stock (right?) before ex-date and then sell an ATM or ITM covered call right afterward.  Profit from the divi plus the CC premium(s).  If the stock isn't called away then sell another one to collect even more premium.

2) Sell a cash-secured put (CSP) ATM and expiring the Friday before the ex-date.  This brings in a very nice premium, most times more than the divi.  If assigned sell an ATM or ITM CC for another premium. This profits from the put premium plus the divi and the call premium.  In some cases, the call expires without the stock being called away so another CC can be sold for a higher return.  

Note that if the CSP expires OTM then the trade just keeps the put premium and closes.

The downside is the stock dropping unexpectedly and the premiums collected will help lower the net stock cost so this can be minimal.  Also, it is a good idea to get the stock closed prior to any earning report.

I just bought WDC and collected the divi plus the stock rose from the time I bought it so I sold CCs above the net stock cost so got that plus the premium.  It was a triple dip if you will.

I got a lot of help by watching various dividend investor videos and some various other users here to build my pie. I like it, but I have a few problems with it.

1. I have wayyyy too many individual stocks, which honestly is just too much to keep up with.
2. I feel less safe having no ETF's of any kind. Although I wonder if double dipping makes any sense in any case?
3. Im more of a conservative investor so I feel like using dividend based ETF's just makes more sense.

So what im thinking of doing is the following:

1. 20% of my Pie is Bonds (I heard somewhere that vanguard said that 20% is basically a magic number for bonds but maybe I just made that up). Im 33 so it's about right for me. (BTW I have difficulty choosing which bonds and my bonds are basically a copy paste...is there a good guide for choosing bonds? Especially ones that do dividends?)
2. Some percentage (Maybe 30-50%) purely ETF's/Index funds. Stuff like SPDR/VIG/VYM/etc... , also maybe some sector specific ones (Although im unsure where to find these, but I do like investing in specific sectors).
3. The rest minus 5-10% in categories like I have (maybe a max of 2-3 per category). Ones that I like and can keep track of easily. Basically a toned down version of what I have
4. The last 5% in ""fun"" stocks. 5 companies maybe that I just really like and want to watch (Maybe specific sectors im interested in or something)

* Certainly profiles of some type if people add individual stocks and holdings as opposed to a '10k at 4% in 5 years' type calculator.
* Integrate with a financial API to grab dividend yields based on user inputting a ticker
* popular stats based on users (if I ever have any heh) '32% of dividend investors have this stock in their portfolio. For 10% of investors, this stock is more than 5% of their portfolio.

GAIN has a lower yield but has had slight dividend growth over the years and it actually pays out two special dividend each year (June and December).

I’ll go over how the column is scraped, keep in mind when a value is BLANK that does not mean its ZERO, rather there was no information on it **(AND YES THERE ARE SOME SKETCH COMPANIES ON THIS LIST IN THE HIGH YIELD CATEGORY SO DO SOME ADDITIONAL RESEARCH)**:

&#x200B;

**Growth** = how many years the dividend payout has increased measuring backward from 2019.

The value before the decimal point = years it has grown

The value after the decimal point = years it stayed completely flat

For example:

if the value is 0.09, then that means for the past 9 years the payout has been the exact same

If the value is 6.09, then that means there was 6 year of growth and 9 years of the same payout

If the value is 69, then that means there were 69 years of payout growth

&#x200B;

**Years Paying** = how long the stock has been paying dividends

If the value is blank, then you should manually check yourself how long they have been paying

&#x200B;

**EPS** = Earning Per Share

&#x200B;

**DPS/EPS** = the % ratio of dividend payout to earning per share. I’ve read somewhere that the best value is under 0.35 and the good value is under 0.55

&#x200B;

**Debt-Equity ratio** = how much debt the company has. I’ve read somewhere that values less than 2 are ideal

&#x200B;

**Start Profit** = profit generated by the company 4 years ago (up to 1/30/2016)

&#x200B;

**Final Profit** = profit generated by the company this year (up to 2/2/2019)

&#x200B;

**Delta Profit** = the difference between Final and Start. Essentially to make sure the company is net profitable

&#x200B;

**%** = % movement via stock appreciation from current year to previous year

&#x200B;

**%%** = Total % movement via stock appreciation for all the years tracked

&#x200B;

**Total % Profit** = Total % movement via stock appreciation + (marked yield \* all years tracked).

&#x200B;

So my question for everyone:

1. What are some fundamentals or other stats that you factor in?
2. If you are following metrics i've outlined on this sheet before, what are your thoughts on these thresholds? (debt being less than 2, dps/eps less than 2, or do these not really matter?)
3. What is your experience of having a portfolio with high yield vs low yield in the long run?

2. How do I configure DRIP reinvesting? Can I choose this option upon buying a stock?
3. The dividend aristocrat ETF NOBL has a yearly yield of  ≈ 2%, which is only slightly above inflation. Are there any ETF's with a higher yield (between 3 and 4%) ?
4. Is it preferable to buy stocks or ETF's ? Judging I just want to invest and forget about it
5. I live in Belgium where dividend taxation is 30%, is there any additional taxation when receiving dividends from US companies? I also hold an Estonian OU which has been inactive in the past 18 months (previous ecommerce business registered under it). Would it make sense to hold the stocks via the Estonian limited company rather than a person in Belgium? I might relocate in a non-EU country in the next 2 years.

t3_c9uipq,ABBV dividend growth,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here, but I have been lurking for a while.

&#x200B;

I have recently done some dividend analysis on ABBV, and was looking for some outside opinions as I am strongly considering adding ABBV to my portfolio.  If one examines the average rate of growth on ABBV's dividend since its split from Abbot in 2013, ABBV is growing the dividend at around 18% per year (18.16% is the number I came up with).  This does include a Jan 2018 - Jan 2019 increase of 50%, which is an outlier, and removing that increase from the calculation results in an 11.8% increase year over year (on average).  

&#x200B;

I arrived at these numbers by determining the % increase between each year, and averaging the resulting percentage increases together (as an aside, is this a good way of determining average dividend growth?). 

&#x200B;

Abbot has a smaller year over year increase, around 9% on average each year over 20 years, but since the starting yield if the stock were purchased today is smaller, it does not result in the mammoth possible dividend gains that ABBV does.  However, these were once the same company, and I am wondering if it would be prudent to examine Abbot's dividend growth as part of ABBV's for the years in which the companies were one.  

&#x200B;

If I include Abbot's dividend increases as part of ABBV's in order to get 15 year history, the average annual dividend growth rate is 12.69%, 10.02% if we remove the outlier (2018-2019).  I did not include any calculation for Abbot's dividend payment in 2012 as it relates to ABBV's first dividend payment in 2013.

&#x200B;

Assuming I'm not missing something huge in the way that I am calculating the annual growth, this is still a pretty great dividend growth rate in my opinion, especially with ABBV's current starting yield after the dip. 

&#x200B;

What are your opinions on whether or not this rate of growth is sustainable long term?  Taking the lowest of the above figures (10.02% annual dividend growth), one could get a 39% yield on cost in 20 years, not counting reinvested dividends.  Do you think this is sustainable?  Are there problems in my math?

&#x200B;

So with that total I am trying to go with SPHD 15% PEY 15% SRET 20% HYZD 20% and drip. if my napkin math is right after 4 years not counting gains/ year of return I should have about 18k invested with drip, With me putting in at 250 a month.

&#x200B;

That give me 30% left over

With the remainder 30% I am going to spread it over with stocks of  LOAN, GEO, BP, VET, Then keep the Divs form that and mabye a few others that don't pay divs that I can swing trained like KEM.

t3_cxx57r,"Dividend Report for August 2019, and strategy adjustment","My monthly total for August, 2019 was $213.58 across all accounts, nearly exactly what the total was in August of last year. Quarterly was $795.19, and annually $3,030.29. Average monthly dividend is again $252.52.  It's kind of weird how that worked.

My overall yield across all accounts today is 11.86%, with an expected gain of $3,488.68 over the next 12 months. I'm at 6.346% of my goal, currently earning $1.68 per hour in dividends alone. (Annual/(52 weeks, 40 hours a week)).  I'm doubling my money every 6.53 years.

This is the 11th month with a total above $100, with September, 2018 being the last month below that threshold.

I've been learning a lot and listening to the Financial Velociraptor, and I've also been doing a lot of research into the stocks that I'm tracking.  I think it's time to change things up a bit.  I've been focused on yield, wanting to reach escape velocity as quickly as possible, but the returns that I have been getting, while impressive, are also disappointing if you look at total portfolio value.  Now, I don't pay all that much attention to capital gains, because I am a buy and hold forever investor, but what the Raptor has told me about Dividend Growth investing makes a lot of sense.  So I started plugging in numbers for 1,2,5, and 10 year Dividend Growth and 1,2,5, and 10 year Stock Performance.  Gotta love spreadsheets with a ranking function, because it becomes easy enough to come up with a way to rank all of these securities against each other in many different ways.  If you take the ranking numbers and average them out, the best ranked stocks for all of these categories float to the top.  Here's the list of the top 10 ranked Dividend Growth stocks, based on the research that I've done so far.

&#x200B;

BA

HD

TXN

CMCSA

AVGO

JPM

QCLN

NEE

MSFT

DDF

&#x200B;

I still have a lot of research to do, so that top 10 list will change as I plug in more and more numbers.  But it's a pretty solid list of stocks, and anyone who has held those stocks over the last 10 years has seen an impressive increase in the dividends they have been getting.

Doing the same thing with stock performance gives a different list:

&#x200B;

SUI

AVGO

MSFT

COST

MCD

HD

NEE

TXN

AXP

ABT

&#x200B;

There is some overlap here, so let's combine these two measures and come up with a list that shows the best stocks for dividend growth AND stock performance.

Remember, I have almost 600 stocks on my list, but with the numbers I have collected so far, this last list of 10 are extremely solid stocks that will likely grow their dividends and their stock value over the next few years.  A portfolio based on these would likely perform very well against the S&P 500.  No guarantees of course, past performance vs. future etc.  But the question is what should I do with this information.  How should I adjust my purchases to make use of this new ranking system?

Right now my overall dividend yield is 11.86%.  That's EXTREMELY high, and I've joked with friends that I call my strategy ""Walking on Hot Coals"".  I've been doing this for almost 10 years, focused on high yield stocks, ignoring the advice of wiser investors, and built a portfolio that terrifies many of them.  I like the fact that the dividends I have received in total exceeds the amount of cash that I have put into my portfolio, but that might be a good time to change things.  I think 10% is a good overall yield to strive for in the long term, and I think finding a balance between walking on hot coals and building a solid foundation is something I can do.  So, here's the new strategy;

If my yield within a portfolio is less than 10%, I will continue to buy solid high dividend stocks, ETF's, REITs, etc.  I have always done the research on whether the dividends are likely going to keep paying based on cash flow, the type of business, and REITs are a great source for that kind of high yield strategy because real estate investments are very solid and they are under obligation to pay out 90% of their profits anyway.

But if my yield within a portfolio is higher than 10% it's time to step back from that strategy and let the accumulated dividends go towards the purchase of high ranked dividend growth and performance stocks that will net me a stronger portfolio over the long term.  These are the stocks that are likely recession proof, their market capitalization is in the hundreds of billions of dollars each, and they'll be able to weather the storm that is coming.

So that's how I'm going to reach my balance point, sticking with the goal of an overall yield of 10%.  It may take longer to gather up the money I need to make a purchase, but I remember those days and I think I can resist the temptation.  I'll plug away for a few months and let everyone know how it goes.

t3_d00bwe,Div Guidance | Reinvesting,"Hey! Im not trying to sell anything! 

I see a lot of posts about which Divs and when and am looking for a little hand holding with which direction to go. With my company and my position I get a certain amount of stock each year and a certain percentage of that Vests over years. So next year lets say I get 5k in Stock. 

My thought was to cash it out and roll it into Dividend stocks and set those to reinvest and just continue that plan each year. Obviously managing the stocks I hold for performance and what not but there are some solid stocks that will be around longer than me. 

My question is this- I'm not looking for a monthly payout and at 46 am more looking to building the faucet I will need when I retire and turn this faucet from reinvest to distribute and banking on the free stocks ( after taxes.) to turn the Dividend stocks into reinvested and multiplying stocks.

Situation:

New to dividends, need advice.

I rent out an appartment for 600€/month and would dedicate about 400€/month going into a strong long term dividends portfolio.

I am in Belgium where dividends witholding tax is 30% and will use my bank's platform for purchasing stocks. (Bolero, by KBC/CBC). US dividends will be taxed at 30% and an additional lower rate of 15% comes on top by the Belgian tax authorities instead of a full 30%.

Questions:

1. What stocks do you advise me judging that I wish long term returns and will not manage this more than 30 mins every weeks.
2. Is it better to go ETF's or stocks ?
3. Judging that if I get US dividends, my taxation rate will be 45%, is it just better to stay with Belgian stocks?
4. When should I consider opening a holding company for getting better taxation rates on my dividends?

The function is simple:
• Sign up and activate your account by the registration email send to your email box (so the system will be able to send out the notification email).
• Input the company you want to watch at the left top box, and then select from the list popup.
• Input the high and/or low watermark
• Click on Save button. The company shall appear in the right side. The data might not be loaded immediately, please wait for couple seconds and then click on the green refresh button to see if the data loaded.

t3_dmgv8q,Well-performing stocks to hold when starting portfolio? BPY-UN.TO (BPY Nasdaq)? BAC? MO? Or simply start with Dividend Aristocrats?,"   Hey all. 22 year old university student studying business in Canada, majoring in Economics and Finance. In my corporate finance course, we've recently been learning how to value stocks and bonds using different methods. Specifically, how to calculate revenue flows from the face value of bonds and their coupon rates, as well as stock prices based on the intrinsic value an investor places in a company and the dividends received. I've always know this is how the stocks are valued on the market, but haven't had the proper framework of thinking to fully understand this. My father used to tell me often about the power of compounding interest, over and over giving me the ""double a penny every day for 2 months or flat sum"" story, and it hasn't been until now that I've truly realized what that could equate to me personally. That is, if I put in the effort and show the discipline. 

   I've always been a major believer in accumulating wealth and allowing that wealth to work for you. Unfortunately, however, I haven't found the drive or necessity to make that happen for myself. After investing in my education, working hard at a serving position many days during school, and reducing my expenses as much as possible, I am fully committed to setting myself up for success. 

   I currently have about $1000 CAD to start a portfolio, and I have the intention of putting 70% of my tips accrued throughout the month into the portfolio moving forward. This will equate to about $600 CAD a month ($75x3days/week= $225 ; $225x.7 = $157.50 \~\~ $150). I've done a heavy amount of research into which investment style fits my personality and habits best, and the dividend growth method best suits my traits. Day-trading and swing trading feel more like informed (or uninformed, depending on your knowledge level) gambling. Although I do consider myself a risk-taker, I don't believe I have the experience and fortitude to tolerate the short-term, volatile goals of these strategies. I do have school to pay off, but my desire is to grow this portfolio as much as financially possible before I start accruing interest on my loans in just about 2 1/2 years. And to do this, I can't lose all of my assets invested due to my own lack of knowledge or insight.

   Now, I've done a fair amount of research into which stocks offer good yields, have good growth and have compiled a few watch-lists based on the criteria I've outlined. Thanks to a few accounting courses, I can pretty easily find my watch through reported balance sheets, income statements, etc. and have a good understanding of what to look for on these documents. BPY seems like a solid company, with international holdings, a strong investor backing and a forward yield of 6.82%. The only thing that seems to be a bit concerning to me is their assets-to-liabilities, which tells me they could face tight liquidity issues if they do not maintain their rental fees.

   Is this concerning enough to stay away, or is a this a good buy to hold for the future? Options I've looked at is Bank of America Corporation, Visa, Alteria Group, and others listed as dividend aristocrats, as well as quite a few REITS and MLP's.  Am I better of going with ONLY these guaranteed, proven winners, or should I feel confident with companies that pass my own analysis as well as diversify myself with these All-Stars?

   The platforms I've chosen are SimpleWealth Trade due to their commisionless service and IB for their history of being a cheap, trusted broker in Canada. I am using OptionsAlpha free, yahoo finance and finvis to supplement SimpleWealth's lack of analysis tools.

TL;DR: What the title says. I have $1000 CAD AKA Pond Scum, which stocks should I buy to start my dividend investing journey?

Thanks in advance for any answers, tips or wisdom!",11,0.93,1571925868.0

t3_dre5gz,I have a newbie question,"
I'm not real bright, I think there's something going above my head here. What I don't get is if an index fund/stock grows more than a high-paying dividend fund/stock, then why not own the index fund now, cash out later when it can be transferred to high dividend-paying stocks, then you get the best initial growth while trading it out for cash flow later? 

Assuming you can't live off your dividends or other investments yet, then you have to continue earning an income and contributing to your portfolio anyway. During that time, having the dividends come in doesn't help that process more than the typical gains on an index fund. Or is it possible that the total return of a high dividend-paying stock/fund can beat a typical index fund anyway?

Maybe it's foolish to compare only two particular stocks and I'm comparing apples to oranges, but the Vanguard high-dividend paying ETF (VYM) sits at 9% annual return over the last 5 yr period @ ~3.3% dividend yield, while Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) had annuals returns of 10.7% over the last 5 yr period @ ~2.1% dividend yield. Which is a 1.7% gap in annual returns. 2.1% when you include distribution taxes on both ETFs. 

Of course this ignores tax on eventually selling your index fund rather than holding a high-dividend stock like VYM forever, which may actually negate any of the S&P 500's additional gains.

I'm speaking at the absolute limits of my financial intelligence here so I'm sure I'm messing up something in my example and missing a key concept here ... what is it? I also understand that when you do eventually sell an index fund you may have to wait years to time the market and get out into something that can provide more cash flow.... is it that along with the earlier mentioned tax which is the real detriment to holding an index fund rather than dividend stocks?",2,1.0,1572851567.0

&#x200B;

While the numbers I just provided are purely for the sake of illustrating an example, is it true I need to invest much more in order to profit? I've been told dividends are a rich man's game and that you only truly profit if you invest large (20k+) amounts so that you can earn back portions of it to buy more shares. From the way I see it now, if I invest $5,000 a year and get back let's say $100 in dividends, I don't understand how I would make the original $5,000 back in my lifetime. I understand compound interest and that eventually I'll build up to earn that $5,000 back with time, but if I have to constantly reinvest money each year or each month, how do I earn more than I invest?

t3_dww5s1,Rules of Thumb for Buying Dividend Stocks?,"I am trying to come up with some very rough rules of thumb for buying long term dividend stocks. Here are some basic ones I have come across in my research:

* The company should be established and have been around for some time (e.g. not Uber or WeWork).

* The stock should have a dividend yield of greater than 4% if possible. If not, then greater than 3%. If none are available because everything in the market is way overpriced and in a bubble, then greater than 2.5%. Also, yield should not be too high either unless it is a special situation like a REIT.

* The payout ratio should be less than 75%, roughly. Lower is better.

* The 5 year growth rate should be at least twice as much as inflation (>4%), at the very least. Higher is better as long as we keep the other rules in mind.

* Dividend growth should be at least through the last financial crisis (i.e. ~11 years), but longer is always better. 

* Assuming all the above is true, then I should evaluate the company based on moats, value, etc, etc.

Asked a little differently....assuming the dividend is not growing or shrinking, do I always get paid the same dividend per share of stock no matter what the price is doing or how I have purchased shares over time?

Or asked a little more differently, if I continue to purchase shares over time, is the dividend I am paid for each share of a company I hold based on the date I purchased it and the yield on the date that I purchased it? What if I buy one share every week and the yield is going all over because the price is going all over? The dividend for each share would need to be calculated separately?",6,1.0,1573839408.0

Let me explain the BHV and JPST positions: I'm currently saving for a house and I wanted something safe that paid a dividend better than my VMMXX stockpile. The monthly dividends from BHV are state and federal tax-free and it's been going great so far! JPST is taxed as ordinary income and is similar to a money market. That position will probably be pushed to equities as soon as there's a market downturn. Right now the actual numbers are off since it's in the middle of rebalancing. I add $150/week to the pie and I have the selling feature turned off. That means any rebalancing must be done via buying. I know I only have exposure in a few sectors. I'm a huge fan of datacenter REITs. The business is here to stay forever, IMO.

In September 2017, I made $561.74

(Keep in mind those numbers are just for one month, september, which is a high-dividend month since it's the end of a quarter)

My expected 2020 dividends are: $13,421.85. This means I've hit the $1000/month milestone!

Total portfolio value as of right now: $475,456.55

I totally love dividend growth. My best stock purchases were good companies that had their stock price beaten down. Like T, MMM, ABBV, CVS, MO -- they can give me some very nice principal growth, not just dividend growth. When good companies are on sale, I buy as much as I can! And there's \*always\* something on sale.

My largest holding is T, at about $15,000 -- which is only about 3% of my portfolio, since I like to be very well diversified.

I also have a lot of REITs like O, KIM, SPG. O is kind of expensive now but it's just such a good company. My worse buy is SKT, which is down to $16 now, since I bought it at $24. I'm buying more now that it's lower, since I think it's still a good company.

Not all of my portfolio is dividend-payers -- I also own some tech companies, like OKTA, AMZN, AMD, BABA -- these just get me exposure to possible growth. AMD has been my best buy so far, since I bought it at $12, and it's now $38.

I have over 60 holdings. I accumulated so many because I just really like buying things when they go on sale. And usually that's only a small window of time when good companies are on sale. Then, when the price goes back to normal, I don't buy any more. I just keep the stock, collect divs, and look for other companies on sale.

After selection of a dividend portfolio, is it a better to allocate $150K in one go, or to  invest, for example,  $2K a week for 18 months, or somewhere in between?

A little at a time gives DCA advantages but that is geared towards investment. It will produce lower income  initially as the vast majority of cash is sitting idle and not working.

I thought of this new strategy (new to me at least), but it seems too good to be true. I'll break it down from what I understand about dividends and would appreciate if I could get some feedback on whether this strategy will work or if I'm missing something. 

&#x200B;

Let's say a stock is offering a 10% dividend yield. I'll call it stock X. I want to invest $1000 into stock X which is equivalent to 1 share. And for argument's sake, let's say stock X is a US Stock, not an International stock.

Stock X's ex-dividend date is 12/20/2019. From what I understand, as long as I buy the stock before the ex-dividend date (so either 12/19/2019 or earlier), I am due 10% of the market value of the share. Let's assume the share price doesn't change much from 12/19 to 12/20, so I am due $100 in dividends. Typically, I will receive the $100 a few weeks after the ex-dividend date.

So my questions are:

\- If I buy the stock the day before the ex-dividend date, is there a certain amount of time I need to hold it in order to qualify for the dividend? So if I buy stock X on 12/19, can I sell it on 12/20 (the ex-dividend date) and receive the dividend? Or do I need to wait a day to sell it (12/21)? Or do I need to wait longer, and if so, how long?

\- I'm assuming I can sell after the ex-dividend date and receive the dividend yield (let me know if this isn't correct). If I cycle between many stocks and do this with 2 stocks a week for example, I would be able to turn a decent profit, assuming I invested in very high dividend yield stocks. Will this strategy work? Am I missing something? I understand the potential cons are waiting a few weeks to receive the dividends and/or if the stock share drops a significant amount on its ex-dividend date. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",5,1.0,1576517008.0

For VYM, the high yield dividend fund, it has yield that is ok. What happens if a company cuts it's dividend, does it get removed?

There were also several stocks which increased their divvy in the 4th quarter.  For the year, all 3 accounts received $31,604.90 in dividends.

Of my 3 accounts, my Roth is very easy to calculate the 2019 returns.  No money except dividends went into the account or came out.  It started the year with $98,258.76 and grew to $136,650.67 producing an increase of $38,391.91 or 39%.  Given that the S&P went up 28.88% I am extremely happy with the performance.

I decided to experiment with my Roth in 2019 since it is my smallest account.  I moved all my REITs into it and most of the stocks were monthly payers.  Unfortunately, when ABBV dropped upon announcing their merger, my Roth was the only account with any cash and I bought it.  ABBV accounts for $10,974 of the total gain on this account.  So my plan for a pure REIT play was foiled.

It will take me the rest of the week to analyze the 2 other accounts because both had funds taken out during the year.",22,0.93,1577888886.0

Are any of those ETFs or stocks with 25%+ dividend yields to even be considered for a portfolio?

t3_ekptd9,10 Dividend Stocks Every 20 Something Should Begin Accumulating,"
All the listed dividend growth stocks have paid and raised their dividend annually for at least 10 years. They are established companies with businesses that have been through terrible market turmoil and have come out stronger.

These stocks can be the foundation of a great dividend portfolio that will get investors through decades of consistent and focused investing that will return capital appreciation and dividend growth.

Investors would be diversified in 5 sectors of the economy. They would be invested in companies that take their dividend payouts seriously and would likely continue to pay and raise their dividends far into the future.

1) **Johnson & Johnson** is a healthcare company that was founded in 1885. It was been paying and raising its dividend annually for over 54 years. In a stock market with thousands of stocks, there are only a handful that have a longer streak.

2) **3M** is one of the most diversified healthcare, technology, and industrial companies in the world founded in 1902. It has been paying and raising its dividend for 59 years.

3) **Coca-Cola** was founded in 1886 and sells and distributes non-alcoholic drinks around the world. Dividend streak – 55 years.

4) **Procter & Gamble** was founded in 1837 and sells beauty, grooming, cleaning, and child care products around the world. Dividend streak – 61 years.

5) **McDonald’s** was founded in 1940 and has over 35,000 restaurants around the world. Dividend streak – 42 years.

6) **Medtronics** was founded in 1949 and is in the healthcare sector. The company sells medical devices and has a dividend streak of 29 years.

7) **Pepsico** was founded in 1898 and sells drinks, food, and snacks around the world. Dividend streak – 29 years.

8) **Qualcomm** was founded in 1985 and designs, develops, manufactures, and markets digital communication products worldwide. Dividend streak – 13 years.

9) **Southern Company** was founded in 1945 engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Dividend streak – 17 years.

10) **Microsoft** was founded in 1975 and develops, licenses, and supports software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide. Dividend streak 15 years

I'm working my way into owning all ten of these companies. I am in my late 40’s. I plan to have all of them in my portfolio over the next 3-5 years. I hold 13 companies right now and have 25%ish of my portfolio in an S&P 500 fund. I hold 10-15% in cash to add to my current shares or buy new positions when I believe valuations are right. 

I want to have a dividend portfolio of approximately 25 stocks by the time I hit 55 years of age.

Get your actions steps together now before the nonsense and noise attempt to take you on a wild desperate ride that could cost you tens of thousands or more in fees, taxes, and capital losses.
Are you going to sell everything? Are you going to sell half, a third? Are you going to hold fast at your current levels? Are you going to fight the noise and actually add to your holdings? Are you going to hold a specific percentage of cash? 10, 20, 30%? More? How far down will you wait for stocks to drop before you begin deploying the cash into stocks again?
Will you be patient and change nothing because you understand your investments and don’t fear short-term losses? If so, will you continue to add capital on the way down? How much capital will you add. The same as before? More, less?
Will you be moving your money out of the market completely and move into other investments? Are you going into precious metals, bonds, real estate? Something else?

t3_em6q64,Question on div reinvestment strategy,"I just read a comment where someone takes their dividends earned over a short period of time (call it the last week), plus any new capital you want to invest, and then reinvests that week’s dividends into whatever position they like that is closest to its ex div date.  

Theoretically this would bring you income faster than a simple DRIP, which may take a quarter for the div growth.  

If you keep doing this every day/week/weeks, it would feel like it could juice the growth in your dividends but want to get thoughts on this.  

Also, not necessarily asking about portfolio value as I know theory says price declines in tandem with div payout.  Strictly talking div stream.

I’m at the point where I’m averaging about $1500 a month so between that and no trade fees, I’m really intrigued by this thought so would love to hear yours!
----
Edit for additional clarification:

Assume this scenario:

I'm getting about $2000/month in dividends and let's say I invest an extra $2000 of fresh capital every month, for a total of $4000.  Let's assume that this $4K is ready to invest at a rate of $1K each week.

Let's also say I have a stable of 25/50/100 dividend stocks that I feel comfortable investing in.

Each week I take my $1K, and invest in whatever has the nearest term ex div date.  This brings forward the dividends (and compounding) faster because I'm getting the dividend in a week vs in a quarter.

The next week I have my same $1K, plus the dividend from the last investment that just went ex div, and do this again for the following week's ex div stock.

It seems to me that doing this every week would speed up the compounding exercise vs waiting for dividends every quarter.",3,0.81,1578557296.0

Brokerages have zero commission now, and probably have a checkbox next to your position for auto-reinvesting distributions.

So, why go though a company run DRiP, and get charged fees, when you can use a Broker and reinvest automatically for free?

Also, how is the new stock price determined on re-invest? Is it an average? or the distribution payout date? Do company run DRiPs purchase new stock at a discount?

I feel like im missing some crucial information.

Im trying to calculate numbers, so the more details, the better!

I watched this interview of Jeffrey Gundlach (DoubleLine Capital), and it made me think about a recession. IF if if if a recession was going to hit, what stocks would do well? or at least hurt the least.

Googling around.. here's what i found.. we would have to analyze each one, but at least we have a crowd sourced starting point. I made the initial list from a quick google search, so don't think i know what im talking about :)

Anything i missed? We should make a huge list, and we can discuss WHY they belong there.

WMT - Walmart - low cost everything.

DLTR - Dollar Tree - no div - low cost staples.

ROST - Ross Stores - low cost clothing.

TJX - TJ Maxx - low cost clothing.

MCD - McDonalds - fairly cheap quick meals.. 2 big macs for $5..nice.

K - Kellogs

ROL - Rollins - pest control! this is probably a luxury item when strapped for cash! ha!

HRB - H&R Block - still need to do taxes

INTU - Intuit (Tax software/service) - still need to do taxes

AZO - AutoZone - you won't have money for a new car, or costly dealership service. Fix it yourself!

BF.B - BrownForman - Jack Daniels - lots of stress, probably going to drink away some pain.

BMY - Bristol-Myers Squibb

MKC - McCormik - cheap cheap food. need to spice it up to make it taste better.

HRL - Hormel (SPAM!!) - Cant afford ribeye! good ol SPAM

V - Visa - no cash, need to borrow to make ends meet.

CHD - Church and Dwight - Consumer Brands, ie Arm&Hammer,OxiClean,Orajel

IAU - iShares GOLD Trust

ED - Consolidated Edison

COST - Costco! Low cost QUALITY items.

&#x200B;

The last recession was 2008-2009. We would have to check to see how well the above companies did during that time. Questions would be.

Did the stock price go up during 2007-2009?

Did they cut dividends during the 2007-2009?

If the stock price tumbled or the dividend was cut, did they have a comeback? We will have to make this question another thread!

t3_esccrj,Renewable energy dividend stocks,"Over the last week I have been looking at opening a new position in a company that is making moves to capitalize on the finally growing renewable energy sector.

I understand that NEE is probably #1 on everyone’s list, but because it’s the most obvious I’ll pass on throwing down info on it.

I decided to look into PEGI, TAC and SU

From doing research, it looks like PEGI is going to be going private here soon. This kills any chance of a long term hold.

TAC is sitting around $7.50 a share and offers a $0.0425 dividend per quarter. They took a pretty major hit a few years ago due to regulations in Canada but have been making strong moves into renewables for a while now. I expect that looking into the future they will continue to grow their dividend and has the potential of being bought out by a larger company like NEE in the future. It looks like recently the price has been starting to go back up and has a good future outlook. 

SU is one I’m unsure on still. They had some bad news the last couple days being told to halt work in confined areas and the likes. This drove their price down a few %. They look to be moving into the renewable section, but at a pretty slow rate. Their price looks better with their recent slide in price $33.35 and a dividend of $0.3163. I don’t foresee SU dropping drastically, but I’m unsure of its long term future with their slow pace towards renewables.",10,0.92,1579701845.0

t3_etqd4o,Baseline Stock: Is it better than Coke (KO)?,"So, as some of you know, im new to dividends and learning a lot here. thank you for everyones help.

Coke (KO) for me, seems to be a slow steady stock. very consistent in payouts, always raising dividends for 50+ years. Its not just a dividend aristocrat, but its in the KING category. You cant go ""wrong"" with Coke. It can ride through recessions, and keeps climbing. slowly.

you may have also seen some of my experiments: I randomly purchase or not purchase stock, every market day, from a certain year. and see what my returns would be today.

TICKER   return\_on\_capital + return\_on\_dividends = total\_return

KO   112.65% + 1.63% = 114.28%    year=2019  <== started buying in 2019

KO   119.01% + 3.32% = 122.34%   year=2018

KO   122.68% + 5.17% = 127.84%   year=2017

KO   124.98% + 6.80% = 131.78%    year=2016

KO   127.45% + 8.48% = 135.93%    year=2015

KO   148.91% + 20.56% = 169.46%    year=2010

KO   192.22% + 42.35% = 234.58%    year=2000 <== started buying in 2000

the randomness is important. Its to show what would happen if i DO NOT try to time the market. Sometimes i buy high, and sometimes i buy low. Who knows, who cares. for now.

So if you started buying in 2000, you would be up on average 234% (not dripping). with little volatility. Theres a very good chance your results would be similar.

So now, when i ask ,""Is this (XXX) a good stock?"" well..compared to what? So now im comparing to Coke. If it hasn't beat grandpa Coke historically, it has a high probability it won't do it in the future.

Then i thought, what stocks (paying dividends) would probably have done better than KO? What about WALMART?

WMT   105.77% + 0.97% = 106.74%    year=2019

WMT   114.19% + 2.10% = 116.29%    year=2018

WMT   122.74% + 3.34% = 126.08%    year=2017

WMT   130.98% + 4.72% = 135.70%    year=2016

WMT   136.12% + 6.13% = 142.24%    year=2015

WMT   153.06% + 13.15% = 166.21%   year=2010

WMT   180.84% + 25.05% = 205.90%    year=2000

Coke, actually returned more than Walmart. Not saying WALMART is a bad stock. i don't think it is. Its just that WALMART has similar volatility, and returned less. Less than Coke. And if you goal is to live off of dividends, KO returned more in dividends, over the same period.

Lets look at one of our favorites, O - Realty Income Corp.

O   107.10% + 1.90% = 109.00%    year=2019

O   120.42% + 4.22% = 124.64%    year=2018

O   124.14% + 6.35% = 130.49%   year=2017

O   124.80% + 8.58% = 133.38%   year=2016

O   130.62% + 11.07% = 141.69%    year=2015

O   157.77% + 24.76% = 182.52%   year=2010

O   248.19% + 75.00% = 323.18%    year=2000

Comparing O and KO, Coke actually is winning in 2019. Then slowly falls back. O appears to give better average Returns over the long haul. But we need to keep in mind that O is way more volatile than KO. Its a REIT, so its taxed as ordinary income, instead of KO's qualified status.

Once you find companies that have performed historically BETTER than Coke (based on your personal criteria), then you would have to look DEEPLY into the company data to see if they are on track to continue performing in the future.

I post this to get feedback. To see if my thinking is flawed. Any and all suggestions are welcome, appreciated and desired. Especially if they conflict with my own.

thanks for your help.

**LTC**

On January 31, 2020, my **428.7895 shares** of **LTC** paid a cash dividend of $**81.47.** 

I DRIPed the payment and received **1.7528 shares** at a price of **$46.48.** 

This bought an additional **$0.33 cash dividend per month**. 

Next month, I expect to receive a **$85.79 cash dividend.** 

The $4.32 jump is mostly due to $1,000 of external capital that will be invested on February 14, 2020. The ex-dividend date for the February 28, 2020 payment is February 19, 2020, so the additional $1,000 will be included on this distribution. In order to estimate the future payment, I use today’s price as the Settlement Price. At today’s price, the February 14, 2020 investment will yield these results:

$1000 / $46.83 = 21 shares.

21 shares \* $0.19 per share = $3.99 additional dividend

Plus $0.33 from the January Distribution = $3.99 + $0.33 = $4.32

Plus the January distribution = $81.47 + $4.32 = $85.79

&#x200B;

**GOOD** 

On January 31, 2020, my **47 shares** of **GOOD** paid a **cash dividend of $5.88.** 

Here is the kicker, I forgot to engage the DRIP. For some reason, the broker I use tends to use “Receive Cash” as a default. I will try to add that $5.88 to the February 28, 2020 $1000 investment (btw, I will be investing $1,000 into GOOD on February 28), but it will be difficult because that will result only in a fraction of a share.

**Learn from me: Don’t forget to engage the DRIP!**

I expect the February 28, 2020 payment to be $11.64. The $5.76 jump is mostly due to $1,000 of external capital that was invested on January 31, 2020. The ex-dividend date for the February 28, 2020 payment is February 18, 2020, so the additional $1,000 will be included on this distribution.",6,0.88,1580847589.0

I'm 23 years old and I've had 7k sitting in my bank for a while (flipped a couple of cars in the past, saved money doing side hustles). Just recently (early December 2019, I discovered investing/ETFs/Robinhood and decided to use that money for long term investing. Heres what yall need to know:

\-I have a 1k emergency fund prepared (aside from my investing portfolio)

\-I have zero debt.

\-I am aiming for a portfolio that is relatively safe (I'm okay with volatility, but don't wanna go all out with REITs and dividend hunt), has some growth, but primarily gives some healthy dividends (3-5%).

\-I have about 8.5k invested in Robinhood right now in the following ETFs:

VTI (2.09% yield): 15%

VGT (0.97% yield): 15%

SPHD (4.34% yield):20%

SPYD (5.05% yield): 20%

VYM (3.31% yield):15%

VTV (3.01% yield) :15%

I aim for like 30% growth (hence the VTI and VGT), 70% dividend (hence the other 4 ETFs). 

Based on my math, assuming all of my ETFs don't grow at all (which most likely won't happen), my annual dividend income with this current portfolio is $271.69 (Which I would continue to reinvest back into this portfolio).

Any and all feedback is extremely appreciated. I'm a newbie to this and from what I know, these are relatively safe for long term investing and still have pretty decent dividend yields.

I've been looking for a relatively stable large cap stock with a decent (+5%) dividend to try a more aggressive approach using covered calls to pep up the returns. The stock needed to at the bottom of its 52 week range with a large float, actively traded, and decent IV on options.

I bought 1000 shares of British Petroleum (BP) during the week of Feb 10th, ensuring that I made the ex-dividend date of 2/13/20. Purchase price was $36.31. Dividend per share is $.62

I sold 10 covered calls expiring next month, receiving $.26 premium on March 20 '20 - strike price of 38, netting $260 in premium.

Month 1 potential results: BP closes below $38:

Dividend (paid in April) +$620 plus +$260 CC premium = (+$880 -capital erosion) (%?)

If BP closes above $38: $1669 appreciation + $620 dividend  + $260 premium = +$2549 (+7.0 %)

Annual return should be +20% annually, or

Second, in July of 2012 I created my monthly dividend portfolio plan. On that day, I decided in March of 2020 I was going to purchase these shares. I just wanted to throw that out there. If you want to properly apply DCA (dollar cost average), a big swing in one month shouldn't impact your investment choices. There will be current events that impact the stock market for the rest of your investment timeline and they should be ingrained into your plan.

If you are trying to ""time"" the market, then I'd say go for it because it is WAY more fun and interesting than consistently investing in income producing assets over an endless period - but consider having some side capital for those transactions. Don't mistake your choices for ones backed my academia or trends. I see a lot of posts commenting on ""dip"" buying as if it is something credible, but remember that it is just for fun. I too bought some extra stuff because the yields are ridiculous, but that didn't change my investment plan. Hey everyone, newsflash: Prices are down and yields are up!

\--------------------------------------------------------------

On February 28, 2020, my 450.5478 shares of LTC paid a **cash dividend of $85.60.**

**This is up $4.13** from January because the [January DRIP](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/2/4/january-recap-83592-in-cash-dividends) bought **an additional $0.33** and [February 14 ](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/2/18/february-14-payday)payday bought an **additional $3.80.** 

I DRIPed the payment and **received 1.8536** shares at a **price of $46.18.** This buys **an additional $0.35 cash dividend per month**. 

Next month, I expect to receive a **$90.09 cash dividend.** 

The $4.49 increase for March is mostly due to $1,000 of external capital that will be invested on March 13, 2020. The ex-dividend date for the March 31, 2020 payment is March 23, 2020, so the additional $1,000 will be included on the March distribution. In order to estimate the future payment, I use today’s price as the Settlement Price. At today’s price, the March 13, 2020 investment will yield these results:

$1000 / *$45.92* = 21.78 shares.

21.78 shares \* $0.19 per share = $4.14 additional dividend

Plus $0.33 from the February Distribution = $4.14 + $0.35 = $4.49

Plus the February distribution = $85.60 + $4.49 = $90.09

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------

 

On February 28, 2020, my 94 shares of GOOD paid a **cash dividend of $11.76.**

GOOD is my newest monthly dividend stock and I need a few more months of data in order to write about it. For now, I will continue to invest $500 to $1000 per month for roughly the next 28 months in order to reach $30,000 capital invested.",22,0.93,1583175605.0

t3_fej5a9,PROJECT DRIP MY TFSA FOR LIFE,"Hello All,

First time poster here. Little back story, I'm 27 yrs old and have been investing on and off since I was 18 Yrs old. By the time I was 19 yrs old I had $20,000 invested with about $6600 in BNS, ENB and BCE all enrolled in DRIPS.

Fast forward a hot minute and I became impatient quickly with the lack of excitement and slow movement so I pulled my then $30,000 (not all gains, I kept adding to my TFSA) and stumbled upon the up and coming marijuana industry. I did day trades, got approved for options, and messed around unknowingly gambling for about 4 years and ended up doubling my money to $60,000.

By pure luck I was at the point in my life where it was a good time for me to buy a house so I liquidated 100% of my investments and had just enough for 20% down on my current home. This just so happened to be right before legalization when the marijuana market to its big first hit.

I thought I was hot shit and could read the market like a god... I was so wrong and it took a little over a year being out of the market to realize how lucky I was.

If I had of left my original drips alone in the beginning and just kept adding the $500 a month as planned the account would be sitting around the 100K mark or more today.

All that being said, I just started back in the market this week with my first purchase of 80 shares in BCE. As seen in the picture my plan is to max out my TFSA as quickly as possible buying a new stock every-time I have $2500 saved away. All stocks will be enrolled in DRIP and when the TFSA is maxed I will switch to the $500/month contributions.

All that being said, next time the next big thing comes around like (the marijuana market) I will be leaving my DRIPS the F&%$ alone!

I look forward to hearing your opinions on my strategy and the stocks I tentatively have chosen as seen above.

Cheers,

**TL/DR:**

I should of left my DRIPS alone and not gambled in the MARIJUANA industry... Got lucky once but probably wont happen again. Pictured above is my new DRIP plan for my TFSA.

I created a Discord chat server focused on dividend investing as a place where you can type (and/or talk) real-time with other investors (as well as people interested in becoming investors).

We just passed over 1035 investors on it.

We have folks in there with decades of experience that became millionaires through investing and people who have never invested and are just interested to learn, and everything in between... From teenagers to people in their 70s from all around the world including China, Croatia, Cyprus, Kuwait, Romania, Finland, Bulgaria, Germany, Canada, Belgium, Singapore, England, Australia, and a bunch of others.

We have a general chat channel that is basically for normal bs’ing, and then we have specific channels for dividend investments and well as non-dividend investments (such as if you want to talk about Tesla or Bitcoin or Real Estate or whatever). That way we keep the investing rooms focused on investing, and the other rooms for other topics, such as movies & tv & books, politics, video games, general news, sports, health & fitness, and others.

On March 16, 2020, my 2537.6614 shares of APLE paid me **a cash dividend of $253.77.**

**This is up $1.66** from February because the February DRIP bought **16.5862 additional shares.**

TJX to suspend buybacks, evaluate dividend and close its stores

TJX Companies (TJX), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods store chains, said Thursday it was suspending its stock repurchase program, evaluating its dividend program and cutting capital expenditures as it looks to maintain financial liquidity and flexibility given uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's current dividend yield was 2.25%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500 of 2.52%. The retailer said it was also drawing down $1 billion from its credit facilities, and withdrawing its financial guidance. And starting Thursday, TJX said it is closing all of its stores in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia for two weeks, and temporarily closing its distribution centers and offices. The company said it plans to pay its store, distribution center and office employees for two weeks during the closures. The stock was little changed in midday trading, erasing an earlier gain of as much as 3.7%. Over the past month, the stock has slid 36.0%, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) has declined 34.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 31.3%.

Ive been trying to understand the debt details of a company, and found this document on AT&Ts site.

Some questions:

Current Position : im assuming this is the amount already paid off. and long term portion is how much they currently owe. 

Maturity Date: this is when the debt is due. But is it ALWAYS a balloon payment on this date? 

Are these all corporate bonds? Do they need to make annual or semi-annual payments?

Yahoo Finance says: 191.68B in total debt.. im assuming if i add up all the numbers on the PDF, it will equal or be close to 191B. 

The news says interest rates are very low, but looking at the PDF, ATT is not getting even close to those rates. Probably due to their credit score?

Credit Score: Baa2 (Moody), BBB (S&P), A- (Fitch)

I guess i can look on my brokerage site to see if ATT is selling any corporate bonds to see what interest rate they are giving. Maybe i can see if ATT is trying to refinance at a lower rate, or maybe they are amassing even more debt.

Sorry this is all vague and all over the place. I hope to derive clues from your answers so i can dig deeper.

Let me know where im wrong, or where my assumptions are incorrect.

The CoronaVirus is keeping everyone home and shutting down business'.

Business are worried that they dont have enough cash to last them during this shut down. They still need cash to pay their lease, employees, utilities, even when they are closed.

So Business' are pulling as much cash from their credit lines as possible, so they can stay afloat during the shut down. If the shutdown ends early, they just pay it back quick, and everything is back to normal.

Because tons of business' are borrowing so much rainy day CASH, banks are running out of cash to lend out. This is the liquidity problem? Or is the liquidity problem that people want to sell their stock or bond, but NO ONE wants to buy it for the price they want. So thats a problem with liquidating. 

Watching BloombergTV, they keep talking about gold dropping due to margin calls. A margin call happens when you borrow money, and if a certain condition is met, the bank can ask for it RIGHT NOW. Which will force you to sell your gold NOW, so you can pay the margin call.

REITs also borrow a ton of money for their real estate dealings. I guess there is some market condition which is triggering margin calls for them?

PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: PMT) announced today that its Board of Trustees declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per common share of beneficial interest for the first quarter of 2020. This dividend will be paid on April 30, 2020, to common shareholders of record as of April 15, 2020.

""We are confident in the return potential of PMT's investment strategies as outlined in our investor update last week and recent market dislocations have improved the attractiveness of future investments generated through our platform; however, we believe that a reduction in the quarterly dividend to common shareholders is appropriate at this time,"" said Stanford L. Kurland, PMT's Executive Chairman. ""In recent years, our dividends to common shareholders have included a return of capital, and had we maintained a quarterly dividend of $0.47, we projected a significant return of capital for 2020 as well. A quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share, combined with the dividends for our preferred shares, is consistent with PMT's expectations for taxable income in 2020, which is the basis for REIT distribution requirements.""

The company is donating 15,000 face masks to hospitals in the U.S., the UK and Spain. Shares were not active premarket, but have fallen 45% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 has fallen 25%.

t3_fqs3rr,DGI Idea: ROST Stores($ROST),"I want to showcase a couple of statistics that I think make ROST a worthwhile investment into this coronavirus weakness.

* 1st of all Rost Store is a discount realtor similar to TJ Max and all revenue comes from US
* Dividend Yield of 1.38%
* EPS growth of 17% (past 5 years)
* Dividend growth rate of 24.9% (past 10 years), Payout ratio of 25%
* Clear plan to expand Rev and EPS through new location opening,100 new stores in 2020 will be added although might be delayed depending on the virus's impact
* Revenue and EPS went up in 2008(reccesion-proof)
* Trading at discount to market at 17.95 PE compared to S&P's 19.12

All in all, this is a company that for the decade has given investors the 19th highest shareholder return out of fortune 500 at 29% a year. Its had a robust and proven plan of growth for Revenue, EPS, and dividend growth while also being a shelter during recessions. This is only being offered at a discount due to coronavirus and hasn't been at a 17 p/e since 2014. Short term headwinds will cause a drop in EPS until the virus is settled and this will be a prime candidate to explode once the virus is contained.

I'd like to highlight the company's undervaluation by comparing it to Costco a company that I think we can all agree has been a very good stock for investors this decade. Costco's business also focuses on discount prices to consumers so I find it to be a fair comparison. ( BTW I'm bullish on COST as well)

* Div Yield:
   * ROST: 1.38%
   * COST: 0.91%
* Div Growth(10 years)
   * ROST: 24.9%
   * COST: 13.7%
* P/E
   * ROST: 17.95
   * COST: 33.36
* EPS growth(5 years)

The husband and I earned approx. $4650 a month on dividend payments. The investment portfolio value is approx 650k with a yield of an average of 8.5% (a combination of income funds, ETFs, REITs, regular stocks). we use the dividend payments to pay all our living expenses and continue to invest with my husband's salary. I quit my corporate job in 2019 and he works for a major Airline (btw we're in Canada)we're obviously worried about how all of the shutdowns to business would affect this situation. living off of passive income from dividends is something we work towards during our GRIND phase and now it was all put into question!! We know an 8.5% yield is a bit risky, but we're still young and practicing the passive income investing strategy of buy and hold.At it's worse our total investment value dropped 30%!! but the good news is that surprisingly almost all our dividends paid out and we're still living off dividends.  The dividend cuts we experience represented 18%, ($VET -Vermilion Energy, was the biggest chunk)

Therefore, returning us approx $3850 in dividend payouts instead of the $4650.

Anyway, just wanted to share a personal story of living off of Dividends during the COVID19 pandemic. The husband and I created a Youtube channel during the two-week quarantine about Passive Income Investing. In the videos, he shares our complete portfolio and talks on each investment, since he's been in research mode the entire time we've been working and saving. Every month we'd look forward to which fund or ETF, or REIT to invest in. We'd do the research and really understand their business. This is mainly because early on we were with our parent's financial advisors, who made the simplest safest investment and charged a hefty management fee. A bit of light reading made us understand how we could do it ourselves for a fraction of that management fee AND get comfortable with a little higher risk tolerance. We're both noobs to creating videos, but passionate about reaching people to help them get comfortable and knowledgeable about passive income investing don't want to self promote on the post so DM me if you're interested in the link to the Youtube Channel.

 Edit: Thanks for all your interest. I wasn't sure if I could self promote the link on this post, but I saw someone else post their link so I figure I can post mine: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSKsvUTiunCbAmV5sZ5nBQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSKsvUTiunCbAmV5sZ5nBQ)",128,0.97,1586021133.0

1. GAIN is trading under $9, I believe this is now a buy
2. LTC represents the senior living sector. I believe this is now a very risky stock. Buy if you are feeling confident, but stay away if near-term volatility bothers you
3. I disengaged the DRIP last month because I was upset at the settlement prices. I've decided to turn it back on moving forward

\-------------

LTC

On March 31, 2020, my 452.4014 shares of LTC paid a **cash dividend of $85.96.**

**This is up $0.36** from February because the [February DRIP](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/3/2/february-recap-85167-in-cash-dividends1).

I took cash in lieu of shares and **purchased 3** **shares** at a **price of $27.86.** This buys **an additional $0.57 cash dividend per month**. 

Next month, I expect to receive a **$86.53 cash dividend.** 

I originally planned on purchasing $1,000 of LTC shares per month until I reached $25,000 of capital invested. However, [my favorite dividend stock, GAIN, has fallen below the $9.00 threshold ](https://www.covercalled.com/finance-blog/2019/2/11/gain-12-buck-chuck)that triggers buying.

I’ve decided to instead contribute to GAIN until LTC looks more attractive or GAIN looks less.

\-----------------------

GOOD

On March 31, 2020, my 121.6279 shares of GOOD paid a **cash dividend of $15.22.**

**This is up $3.46** from February because of the [February DRIP](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/3/2/february-recap-85167-in-cash-dividends1) and $498.29 of capital invested on February 28, 2020. This purchased 27 shares at $18.45.

I took cash in lieu of shares and waited too long on April 3, 2020 to reinvest. On Monday, April 6, 2020, I will purchase 2 shares.

Next month, I expect to receive a **$15.47 cash dividend.** 

\--------------------

GAIN

On March 31, 2020, my 180 shares of GAIN paid a **cash dividend of $12.60.** Even though I now own 353 shares, only 180 of those were acquired before the March ex-dividend date.

I love the management team behind GAIN and have a rule that I purchase this stock when the price is under $9.00. 

The bulk of my GAIN shares came from an investment of $990.64 on March 13, 2020, purchasing 112 shares at $8.85, and an investment of $995.28 on March 27, purchasing 122 shares at $8.16.

I took the cash dividend of $12.60 and purchased 3 additional shares for $7.28 each with a little extra cash.

Next month, I expect to receive a **$24.71 cash dividend.** However, I may also invest another $1,000 on April 10, 2020, depending on how the world is looking. This would be before the 4/20/2020 ex-dividend date and would add to the April dividend.",25,0.96,1586004901.0

t3_fv4lff,GREAT VALUE! $O Realty Corp,"TLDR; Price > $45 Attractive.

Fellow investors,

As we all know **COVID-19** is affecting every aspect of our lives, but it is also presenting many buying opportunities in our market. **$O Realty Corp** is one of them.

Some Quick Metrics @ $45/SHARE :

* Current Dividend = $0.233 /Month
* Current Yield = 6.21%
* Total Debt to Total Assets = 43.28
* EBITDA = 29.46
* Debt to EBITDA = 5.87
* Price to Book Ratio = 2.51
* RSI = 34 (not oversold yet)
* Price to Cash Flow Ratio = 21.78

Its current drop 47%-%50 from ATH is the largest drop in the company's stock history. 08-09 it was 42%.

Its historical yield has rarely gone over 5%

16.5 % compound annual total return.

4.5% Compound Annualized Dividend Growth.

Consistently Keep Occupancy Above 97 %

Had a public offering of 9,000,000 shares @ 77.40 that closed March 2nd LMAO

""Net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $677 million. The company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,350,000 additional shares of common stock. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings outstanding under its $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and, to the extent not used for that purpose, to fund potential investment opportunities and/or for other general corporate purposes.""

**Summary**: $O Realty Corp is an **ELITE REIT** that not only trades at a premium to its peers, but rarely trades at an attractive discounted valuation. For long term investors this valuation is an absolute steal. To dividend investors its an opportunity to add world class company to their portfolio.

**RISKS**: **COVID-19** drags on for more than 3 months, dividend possibly in danger. Government Stimulus is currently a ""life-line"" for some businesses that O Realty Corp rents to and if it dries up they go under and O Realty Corp loses a tenant in them. I am sure that Management is doing everything possible to minimize damage and taking advantage of any program and or opportunities that present themselves to fortify the company,",30,1.0,1586046713.0
t3_fw8z8h,Dividend Discord chat server.. 1460+ dividend investors on it,"Hi all,

I created a Discord chat server focused on dividend investing as a place where you can type (and/or talk) real-time with other investors (as well as people interested in becoming investors).

Our 1469th investor just joined a few moments ago.

We have folks in there with decades of experience that became millionaires through investing and people who have never invested and are just interested to learn, and everything in between... From teenagers to people in their 70s from all around the world including China, Croatia, Cyprus, Kuwait, Romania, Finland, Bulgaria, Sweden, Germany, Canada, Belgium, China, Singapore, Israel, England, Australia, Greece, Switzerland, and others.

We have a general chat channel that is basically for normal bs’ing, and then we have specific channels for dividend stocks and well as non-dividend stocks, and investing channels for ETFs & Mutual funds, Crypto, Commodities, Real Estate, and Forex. We also have a channel for talking about your portfolio & watchlist.

I've also created a channel for dividend alerts which automatically posts dividend cuts or increases which attempts to keep people informed as soon as the information is out there, as well as an automated investing news channel which posts investing articles as they come out, and an automated channel for breaking world news as it comes out.

There are also channels for movies & tv & books, politics, video games, general news, politics, sports, health & fitness, and a Polls channel (to optionally query people's thoughts on a variety of topics). This way we keep investing separate from others topics. I and my friend moderate it to keep topics aligned to channels, and to minimize self promotion or toxic individuals.

Feel free to check it out and chat with others, or come and just lurk :)

t3_fvwkhj,Trying to understand payouts a little better.,"Let's say a stock is $40/ share and has a yield of 4% when I buy that stock I'm thinking I'm making $1.60/shr annually.  Now let's say the stock drops to $30 but maintains 4% yield. Am I now making $1.20 annually. Or do I still make 1.60 on my shares.  Basically I think what I'm asking is. Do I get an annual return based on the price I paid, or the value of my portfolio. 

People say dividends are consistent and even if the value of the stop drops you can still count on your dividends. But this confuses me.  Because if you have $10,000 invested at 4% and are making 400 annually.  But you lose 50% of your portfolio, did you just lose 50%of your annual dividend income?",5,0.73,1586169807.0

He also has a separate education saving fund about 10K as well, but that won't be available until he turns 18. (separate, unrelated set of funds to the question).

He's quite interested on the topic of investing and money, he's also a frugal kid, typically saving 30pct of his meager allowance every week (while donating 10pct).

He's not of legal age yet to open his own account so I'm going to co-open one with him.

Of course, he'll continue to fund the investment in a couple of years once he starts making money.

t3_fxwkkm,NEWS: S&P Dow Jones Indices Reports $5.5 Billion Decrease in U.S. Indicated Dividend Payments for Q1 2020; Worst Quarter since Q1 2009,"S&P Dow Jones Indices announced today that indicated dividend net changes (increases less decreases) for U.S. domestic common stocks declined $5.5 billion during Q1 2020, compared to a gain of $11.8 billion in Q1 2019. This is the first quarterly decline since Q2 2009's $4.9 billion and the worst since Q1 2009's $43.8 billion decrease, $38.7 billion of which was in the S&P 500, when big-banks and General Electric reduced their payments.

For Q1 2020, aggregate increases amounted to $12.4 billion, down 24.7%, from Q1 2019's $16.5 billion. Aggregate dividend cuts increased 278% to $17.96 billion from $4.75 billion for Q1 2019.

For the 12-months ending in March 2020, net dividends rose $28.2 billion, compared to a gain of $51.3 billion for the 2019 period, as increases were $52.5 billion versus $63.1 billion, and decreases were $24.4 billion compared to $11.8 billion for the prior period.

""Dividends had a good run, culminating with a record payment in Q1 2020, as shareholders reaped the benefits of a ten-year bull market,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""March, however, gave a glimpse of what Q2 may be like as dividend cuts and suspensions started to be announced. For 2020, liquidity and cost control are now the top priority, with dividends lowered and buybacks an endangered species.""

Silverblatt continued, ""The full impact of these cuts will soon be felt as fewer and smaller dividend checks are sent out. At this point, the depth of the cuts is dependent on the COVID-19 economic impact. Until we understand its full extent, companies may be forced to take prudent measures.""

Silverblatt concluded, ""At the start of the year, projections were for a double-digit dividend payment gain - now the concern is for a double-digit decline. The bottom-line is that it was a good run, and eventually we'll get back to it; we just have to hang on until then.""

S&P 500 Dividends

On a per share basis, S&P 500 Q1 2020 dividend payments for the S&P 500 increased 9.6% to a record $15.32, up from the prior record in Q4 2019 of $15.21, and up from Q1 2019's $13.98. On an aggregate basis, index components paid $127.0 billion in dividends in the quarter, up from the $117.3 billion in Q1 2019. For the 12-month period ending in March 2020, the index paid a record $59.58 per share, up from the 2019 period's $54.94, with an aggregate $495.1 billion to shareholders, compared to $464.5 billion.

""With GM shares having bounced approximately 50% since hitting a multiyear low on March 18, we lower our recommendation to sell, as shares do not appear to be reflecting the magnitude of the forthcoming drop in auto sales and the possibility of a liquidity crunch,"" he said.

t3_fxqrah,Understanding Furloughs,"While the term “furlough” is not one that derives from any law or statute, it is generally recognized as a ***temporary cessation of employment, with the expectation that the employee will resume work for the employer at a later time***.  A furloughed employee is usually, but not always, unpaid, although many employers ***will continue to provide benefits such as health and dental insurance*** to furloughed employees.

&#x200B;

**Furlough**: Reduced or zero pay. ***The company still pays health benefits!***

**Lay off**: Zero pay. Eligible for COBRA health insurance benefits  for 18 months.

**Fired**: zero pay.. Eligible for COBRA.

The ***Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Ac***t, known as **COBRA**, is a federal law that allows employees to continue their employer-provided health insurance after they are laid off or fired, or they otherwise become ineligible for benefits (for example, because they quit or their hours are reduced below the employer's minimum to receive benefits). The employee has to pay the full premium at the employer-negotiated group rate, which is typically less expensive than it would be to buy an individual policy on the open market.

t3_g0gcvf,Thoughts on dividend investing for non-US residents?,"A non-US resident would have to pay more than the cost of the share, such as 1. foreign exchange fee (varies, but can go from .5 to 2%); 2. brokerage fees (some are free, but most would charge either a percentage or fixed rate) and 3) expense ratio (if buying ETFs). Any dividends received would either be reinvested (another fee if no automatic DRIP) or converted back to local currency (again at a hefty forex rate). With this in mind, does it still make sense to have majority of the one's portfolio in the US stock market? Or is it more cost-efficient to focus on one's local stock market? Even the local stock brokerage firms charge a fixed amount ($30) per trade. Would love to hear from other dividend investors on their take on this. Thanks :)

If I choose to sell a covered call using $XYZ for $2 premium and there's a good chance it gets executed, I would buy another 100 shares of $XYZ. After it gets executed, I would still have 100 shares. I would still get $50 a year from it. But how would they be taxed now? Would I actually lose money because of taxes?

t3_g4qw7d,Costco vs Coke,"On April 15, 2020, Costco ($COST) announced they have increased their dividend 8%! 

Costco is generally not on our dividend radar, probably due to their crap initial buy in dividend of 0.82% annual dividend yield.  ( $0.65 per quarter X 4 times a year ) / $317 stock price

But we are long term investors. (Yes we are! say it to yourself 100 times in the mirror, every day! ha!). So lets look just a little bit deeper, especially the dividend growth.

Last year, Costco increased their dividend 14.04%. the year before that 14%, before that 11.11%..

Annual Dividend Growth: 14.04%, 14%, 11.11%, 12.50%, 12.68%, 14.52%, 12.73%, 14.58%, 17.07%, 13.89%

the 5 year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is 12.86%

Now we have 2 variables, the initial buy in dividend yield, and its 5 year CAGR. 0.82% and 12.86%. So, is that good? dunno. Lets try to compare it to something we like, like $KO Coke.

$KO Coke, has an initial buy in dividend yield of 3.41%! very good for coke! Its generally not in the 3% range! Last time it was in the 4% range was during the 2008 meltdown. Its a Dividend Aristocrat, paying and increasing dividends for 50+ years!

But its growth is dwindling:

Annual Dividend Growth: 2.50%, 2.56%, 5.41%, 5.71%, 6.06%, 8.20%, 8.93% 9.8%, 8.51%, 6.82%

the 5 year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is 4.44%

its 2 variables are 3.41% initial buy in dividend yield, and 4.44% CAGR.

So, which of these two stocks are ""better""?  dunno..too many numbers, giving me a headache :)

Lets figure out how many years it would take for the stock to reach a 10% annual dividend yield! 

COSTCO: at 12.86% CAGR, starting at 0.82%, it will take 21 years.

COKE: at 4.44% CAGR, starting at 3.41%, it will take 25 years.

If you bought COSTCO on 2004-05-06, for $36.30, it paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10, which is an initial buy in dividend yield of 1.1%.. still not on our radar.. but TODAY, you would be receiving a 7.16% dividend yield.. 

If you bought COKE on 2004-06-15, for $51.38 (non adjusted), it paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 (non adjusted), which is an initial buy in dividend yield of 1.95%.. but TODAY, you would be receiving 6.38% dividend yield.

That was 16 years ago, and the forecast seems sorta accurate. That in 6-9 more years,  they would hit approx 10%.

We essentially distilled the stocks 2 variables into one number (the number of years it takes to hit 10%). And based on **JUST THIS INFORMATION**, Costco wins, by a tad. 

So, although many of us dividend investors screens stocks based on their initial annual dividend yield, we could be missing out on companies that start with a lower yield, but with amazing dividend growth.",56,0.98,1587381209.0

Moreover, Goodyear is evaluating opportunities to boost the firm’s cash position in the face of the rising uncertainties due to the coronavirus crisis. The company expects 2020 capital expenditures to be no more than $700 million. **It also suspended the quarterly dividend** ***temporarily***, which is likely to preserve approximately $37 million of cash on a quarterly basis.

To that end, I do my own DD, follow the news, subscribe to ""experts,"" and read this sub among others. Based on these resources, I have built up my portfolio to a place I feel comfortable.

The problem I inevitably run into is finding good stocks I want to add to my portfolio but I don't have ""room"" for them. I set a subjective cap of 50 stocks to keep in my portfolio. Even 50 is a lot, but I feel like more than that is just too much work to track and maintain.

I have a Roth IRA with only ETFs, but wanted to take advantage of the recent bump in the road to build out a brokerage account. Thank you in advance for checking this out!



After about 150 hours of research, this is where my current build out stands: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VKx22VbH60mV2e5zmJjr-9ejrZLZ3R-brnzneBEOETo/edit#gid=0


**Some quick notes about the spreadsheet:**

- I've calculated the current price to the 52w high just to get an idea the volatility of the stock. 
- The dividend safety is from Simply Safe Dividends. 
- ""My sector target"" is the percentage of each stock I would like in that specific sector. For example I have JPM set as 35% of the financial sector. Because financials are currently set at 10%, JPM would consist of 3.5% of my total portfolio. 
- I have a random 3ish year growth section. The is the growth of the stock from 4/20/17 - 2/14/20. This is right before the crash started to happen and 4/2/17 is as far back as the tool would let me go. That's why its random dates. I'm not putting too much stake into these numbers, but it helps a little. 
- The target shares number is there to help me choose exactly how many shares I need to purchase in the end to build this out how I want it. I have set $100,000 at the top just as a random number (this is not my real number). Just an even number to make everything easy to visualize. 

**What I really need help with:**

- I had trouble choosing the percentage that each sector should represent. Any opinions on if I am too high or low on some?
- I spend many hours trying to research all these stocks but I am sure I missed info on many/few. Are there stocks I should be looking at? Some I should consider removing? And am I too high or low of sector share on some of these?",3,0.72,1587483321.0

Thinking of buying more NRZ if it drops below $5 again and maybe MFA and avg it down.

Is it safe to assume that dividend growth investing will outperform growth investing during long periods of stagnation (<1% annual returns)?

The **expense ratio is the annual fee** that all funds or exchange-traded funds charge their shareholders. It expresses the percentage of assets deducted each fiscal year for fund expenses, including 12b-1 fees, management fees, administrative fees, operating costs, and all other asset-based costs incurred by the fund.

[https://www.morningstar.com/InvGlossary/expense\_ratio.aspx](https://www.morningstar.com/InvGlossary/expense_ratio.aspx)

Immediately after the post some people got in touch and started using the service. While trying to prove that my algorithm gives better than the average returns on dividends, I started researching how other people/companies provide this proof and I made a discovery which was kind of shocking, most of them gave a ridiculous number without any proof, the ones who did show some trades to back up their number were only showing their winning trades and positive dividend returns, while conveniently hiding their losses. The most honest companies/Individuals who did show their returns at 8% just in dividends returns with their actual trades seemed to be the real deal but I realized that it was not actually 8%, It is true that they did make 8% in yield but they lost heavily because the actual price of the stock went down and companies to compensate for their poor stock performance were just inflating their dividend payouts, hence in reality they were making 3-4% (Which is still better than most), so I finally came to the conclusion that they only way to show that my algorithm is the real deal is to allow people to see the recommendations for free and not just once but for an extended period of time, so that they can consistently see that it  works.

I'm interested in the dividend growth investing (DGI) strategy where I invest in companies that have consistently increased their dividends every year over time.

I went over to Seeking Alpha and I see that Lockheed Martin has a Dividend Growth History of 17 years.  Dividend.com says the same thing.

Visit the [Dividend Growth History Chart](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT/dividends/dividend-growth) at Seeking Alpha to see what I'm talking about.

Am I reading the chart wrong?  I'm just trying to square away what the chart shows and the 17-year growth that is claimed.  Is it because the dividends earned in 2018 was larger than the 2016 dividends?

2. If the stock falls on the ex-div date, you would potentially lose all your div earnings you’re looking to capture.

I think this may work out:
1. Split your funds in portions so that, while some funds are being settled, you can still invest other funds.
2. Trade options to cover the potential fall of the stock on the ex-div date. The earning from options would cover loss of the fall, and you still keep your div earnings.

I personally like $O, but something seems odd to me

&#x200B;

edit: below, adding more info from the Annual Report

**Capital Philosophy (page 35)**

Historically, we have met our long-term **capital needs by issuing common stock**, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure; however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. **We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities.** However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.

On page 34 of Annual Report . General idea of how shares outstanding is growing over past 5 years. So this jump to 740k is crazy. (EDIT: 740k is authorized, NOT outstanding..read comments below for explanation)

2015 = 235k shares outstanding

2016 = 255k shares outstanding

2017 = 273k shares outstanding

2018 = 289k shares outstanding

2019 = 316k shares outstanding

***now 740k??? wow!!!!!  (EDIT: 740k is authorized.. and NOT shares outstanding, read comments for explanation)***

At December 31, 2019, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loans, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $7.9 billion, or approximately 24.4% of our total market capitalization of $32.5 billion.

Dec, 2019: Shares of our common stock outstanding of 333,619,106, plus total common units outstanding of 463,119, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $73.63per share on December 31, 2019, or $24.6 billion;

&#x200B;

**Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders (page 42)**

We have continued our 51-year policy of paying monthly dividends. In addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2019 and twice in 2020. As of February 2020, we have paid 89 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 105 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.

***Why increase the dividend amount so many times in 2019? Maybe they feel bad about doubling the shares and we didn't get anything?***

Also in January 2020, we announced that Paul Meurer, our EVP, **Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, is leaving the company.** To ensure a smooth transition, Mr. Meurer will serve as a senior advisor to the company through March 31, 2020. The company has begun a search for a new Chief Financial Officer.

Maybe the CFO is disgusted. i hope im wrong.

I quickly ran thru the Annual Report..i will probably do it again and double check their numbers.

If you buy $30p 6/19 with current mark @ $7.50 and you can in turn buy your shares for anything less than $22.49 then you could make money.

# Total cost of investment:

|Trade|Multiplier|Total Cost|

|6/19 $30p w/ $7.50 mark|100|$750 premium|
|$22.49/share|100|$2,249 cost of shares|

Adjust as necessary depending on premium and share price. 

|$2,249 cost of shares|\+ $750 premium|= $2,999 for total investment cost|

But then in the next paragraph:

“Therefore, the ex-dividend date for the cash distribution is expected to be May 13, 2020, the first trading day following the payment date.“

Would the ex date be the day before the record, May 6th, or the day they call out May 13th? Is it saying you have to hold stock from the 6th to the 13th to be recorded? I’m sorry if it’s a dumb question, I’m just getting started trading.

***Suspension of Common Dividend*** \- The Company is suspending its common dividend for the second quarter of 2020 as the Board and management believe it is prudent to conserve cash during this period of uncertainty. If maintained for the balance of the year, the dividend will result in savings of approximately $175 million relative to the prior $0.11 per share quarterly dividend. As the Company continues its pivot to digital infrastructure, the Board of Directors will evaluate go-forward dividend policy in alignment with an increased emphasis on a ‘total return’ approach, which focuses more on capital appreciation relative to current yield as components of total shareholder return.

from the starting page:

## Objective of The Intelligent Investor Book

**Benjamin Graham’s objective was to provide an investment policy book for the ordinary investor. He succeeded in putting seemingly hard concepts into terms that could be understood and, more importantly, implemented by the average investor.**

**The typical investor has a tendency to “follow the market” when they should be employing** [**portfolio risk management strategies**](https://www.arborinvestmentplanner.com/5-portfolio-risk-management-strategies/)**. Instead, Graham gives us an alternative based on fundamental stock analysis.**

**The goal is to learn how to avoid the pitfalls of allowing our emotions to control our investment decisions. Rather, Graham provides the foundation for making businesslike decisions.**

**The Intelligent Investor puts special emphasis on teaching:**

**1. Risk management through asset allocation and diversification.**

**2. Maximizing probabilities through valuations analysis and margin of safety.**

**3. A disciplined approach that will prevent consequential errors to a portfolio.**

t3_ghhym8,What to do with fractional shares when switching from Robinhood to Fidelity?,"Recently I made the decision to switch from Robinhood to Fidelity. With the way fractional shares are handled in transferring I’m wondering what is the best move for me.

I came down to a couple of options:

1) Have a full asset transfer with having the fractional shares sold and moved as cash.

2) Sell the fractional shares before the transfer and use the cash to buy enough to complete whole shares. Example buy 0.5 shares of KO if I already have 1.5 shares.

3) Do a partial asset transfer and keep my fractional shares in Robinhood while my whole shares go to Fidelity.

I’m leading towards option 2 but the thing is I have less than 1 share of AAPL and JNJ. I could buy enough to complete 1 share if JNJ, but that would leave with my AAPL shares in Robinhood. I could do a full transfer and have the AAPL shares sold in Robinhood and rebuy in Fidelity. 

I do plan on keeping Robinhood and use it mostly for growth stocks and have Fidelity as my passive income dividend portfolio. So naturally I would like to remove everything from my account.

2) How are dividends sent out? Do they get mailed as a check/put into my bank account? Or do they stay in the brokerage account (does this vary depending on which brokerage service I choose to use)?

Immediately when I see a chart that has never really been green I tend to shy away, but I still see recommendations from time to time with stocks like this. One post today mentions $WBA. I've seen it especially with tobacco and alcohol stocks, $BUD and $MO are examples here.

Why is this?

Are we expected to dollar cost average in at every opportunity and pray for a spike when ready to sell?

Or maybe need to sell out after dividend issued, before market corrects and buy back in? Seems counterintuitive for long goals

Maybe there's an overall net gain I can't see. Any software recommendations that will show combined div and stock price so I can see this? I've been playing around in sheets, I can pull div history from NASDAQ and the price data, could combine these I suppose.

$IVR  will pay a $0.50 a share dividend for Q1's dividend payment (payable June 30,2020). But there is a catch. It will be divided in cash + shares, with CASH being at least $0.05 a share, the rest in shares. Fractional shares will be paid in cash (paid in lieu).

It seems shareholders have 3 options here:

1. Take all cash - shareholders receive at least $0.05 a share (total value undisclosed)
2. Take all stock - $0.50 in stock
3. Cash+Stock:  cash=$0.05 (10%) + $0.45 (90%) in stock.

Common Stock Dividend

On May 9, 2020, the Company's board of directors **approved the payment of the Company's previously declared dividend for the first quarter of 2020 of $0.50 per share of common stock** (the ""first quarter dividend""). The first quarter dividend will be paid on June 30, 2020 in a combination of **cash and shares** of the Company's common stock to stockholders of record as of May 21, 2020. Given the uncertain and rapidly changing financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's board of directors has determined that the cash component of the first quarter dividend (other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) **will not exceed 10% in the aggregate, or $0.05 per share**, with the balance payable in shares of the Company's common stock. This will allow the Company to preserve capital and enhance the Company's financial flexibility.

In accordance with the provisions of the applicable IRS Revenue Procedures, stockholders will be asked to make an election to receive the first quarter dividend all in cash or all in shares. To the extent that stockholders elect to receive more than 10% of the aggregate payment in cash, the cash portion of the payment will be prorated. **Stockholders who elect to receive the dividend in cash will receive a cash payment of at least $0.05 per share**. Stockholders who elect to receive the dividend in Company common stock will only receive shares of Company common stock. **Additionally, stockholders who do not make an election will receive 90% of the dividend in Company common stock and 10% of the dividend payment in cash.** The number of shares issued as a result of the dividend will be calculated based upon the volume weighted average trading prices of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on June 17, June 18 and June 19, 2020. **Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares so that stockholders receive a whole number of shares of common stock.**

Going forward, given the current uncertainty related to the pandemic's near and potential long-term impact, the Company's Board of Directors will temporarily suspend dividend distributions to conserve approximately $35 million in cash per quarter and preserve the Company's balance sheet strength and flexibility. The Board will continue to evaluate the potential for future dividend distributions on a quarterly basis.

t3_gjuc2m,Should I put my dividend portfolio in my Roth IRA?,"Hello,

My main goal with my dividend portfolio is to have some passive income that I could ideally live off from or at least help achieve financial independence. I know the advantage of putting my dividends in a Roth IRA so that my earnings can grow tax-free. 

The only thing that is stopping me from putting my dividend portfolio in my Roth IRA is that I do have a goal to retire early. I am currently 22 and would like to retire before I reach 59 1/2. If I were older, I would put my dividends in my Roth, but since I am still young I feel retiring early at say 50, for example, is possible. 

I currently have a Roth IRA where I hold a couple of index funds. Would it be better for me to just put my dividend portfolio in my Roth? Or since I want to retire early should I just keep it in my regular brokerage account? I am open to suggestions and different strategies to go about this.

I originally had my portfolio to take $100 monthly and auto invest it into my target date fund but I just finished growing my emergency fund so I am looking to increase it to $500 to reach my goal. Aside from that though I have $2000 extra that I can put towards my portfolio right now and with that I was planning on diversifying my portfolio a bit.

After looking around at dividend stocks I came up with the following:

* $GLAD - \~100 Shares so every month I get a new one with the dividends - \~$600
* $SRET - Same idea as $GLAD - \~$600
* $O and $SCHH - Rest of the money evenly split between the 2

However, during this Covid-19 outbreak, I think it is rather reasonable to think that some of the higher-yield stocks will have trouble paying their dividends.

I've decided to put my money where my mouth is and double down on my monthly buys (I don't really sell anything ever). Here are my picks for the next two months. Academically speaking, I think if you find an investment you like at say $18, and in one month it goes to $9 during a panic sell crisis, you should now want to buy that stock twice as much. Circumstances have changed, I will admit that, but in some capacity, this is still the same stock I researched months ago.

Below is a table of my plan. I have executed the first four weeks and have four to go. If a cell is green in the first table, that is the actual amount I invested. White cells are future purchases. At the bottom of the table, it shows the value of that investment today. As of now, I am down 10% across the board.

I switched from Robinhood to M1 Finance, and I've been playing around with some of my pies and their distributions. I think I've finally got it where I want it and I wanted to see what you guys thought. 

A little background on me is that I'm 29 with a disability pension I got for injuries sustained while in the military. I started investing two years ago. My SO is a chemical engineer who, before being laid off due to CV19, was making in the six-figures. My disability is fortunately enough to cover us for the time being, and she's using the time off to get a Master's degree. So the outlook on the other side of the pandemic is still high. I'm a huge believer in dividend investing and my general attitude is to never sell anything. My hope is that after I die, I have enough money left in the nest egg that we can use the distributions for a scholarship fund to send someone every year to the community college that set me up for success after I left the military. 

I do have some single stocks, but I don't foresee buying more.

So, enough of that. Here's the split:

**45% US Stocks (5.729% DY, 0.22% ER)**

- 40% $SPHD *(5.77% DY, 0.3% ER)* [Monthly]
- 40% $SPYD *(6.69 DY, 0.07% ER)*
- 20% $DON  *(3.72% DY, 0.38% ER)* [Mid-Cap, Monthly]

**34% International Stocks (7.12% DY, 0.54% ER)**

- 60% $EFAS *(7.53% DY, 0.56 ER)* [Ex-US, Monthly]
- 20% $PID *(6.06% DY, 0.54% ER)* [~90% Ex-US Dividend Achievers]
- 20% $DVYA *(6.96% DY, 0.49% ER)* [Asia / Pacific]

**13% Bonds (6.344% DY, 0.35% ER)**

- 60% $VCLT *(3.81% DY, 0.05% ER)* [~85% US, Monthly]
- 20% $HYLD *(9.2% DY, 1.25% ER]* [~75% US, Monthly] 
- 20% $EBND *(4.73 DY, 0.38% ER)* [Emerging Markets, Monthly]

**8% REITS (8.576% DY, 0.21% ER)**

- 35% $KBWY *(12.29% DY, 0.35% ER)* [Monthly] 
- 30% $REET *(7.42% DY, 0.14% ER)* [Global]
- 25% $VNQ *(4.16% DY, 0.12% ER)*
- 20% $VNQI *(10.08% DY, 0.12% ER)* [ex-US]

**The totality of the portfolio sits at 6.344% DY, and 0.35% ER**. 

I feel like I'm well-diversified among sectors, investment vehicles, and geography. Each section has at least one holding that pays monthly dividends and the rest are quarterly payments. I tried to balance DY and ER, and I think I did that to some success. It definitely isn't the highest-yielding portfolio I could have built, but it seems to be balanced and realistic, given my timeframe. As I said, I'd love to know what you guys think of this.

Love this community and lurk every morning before market opens.  (Background) I currently have a portfolio of 44 stocks, yielding around 3.5% across the board.  Total PF value is just shy of $8,000 USD.  41 of those are dividend stocks, with no more than 4% allocated to any one stock.  I am now funding the account with $1000 every 2 weeks and am reinvesting all divs.

In the beginning of building my PF, I needed the advice to avoid the “yield trap”.  After picking out primarily dividend growth stocks like Visa, Disney, Microsoft, etc over the past year, I’m now looking to open up too some high yielding dividend stocks.

I recently put a small tranche in energy/oil majors and got lucky enough to average in at the bottom of the dip.  I am not looking for any oil/sin stocks as I’m already exposed enough for my liking there.

That being said, I’m young (23) and am fortunate enough to have reliable income I can play with for the time being.

What are your guys’ favorite picks to add for some high yield, quick cash that has low (relatively speaking) risk of a div cut?

Thanks in advance!",12,1.0,1589972078.0
t3_gn1t5r,Moving away from passively investing to trying to take control of my finances,"Redditors/
(33M) Looking for investment advice. I have been passively investing for years and have accumulated a reasonable amount of money in various types of investment vehicles. During this pandemic, I have taken a vested interest in how my money was ‘working’ for me, however, with all these investment vehicles, it has proven to be quite challenging to decide how/if I should consolidate. This is coupled with the fact that I really don’t understand them all and was blindly saving. This probably cost me a lot of money over the years.

So, here is a breakdown:

401 (K) – Current Value: $60K Traditional and Roth with company match

Before: Maxing 401 (K) Contributions in Traditional 401(K)
· 70% Target Date fund
· 20% S&P Index Equity Fund
· 10 % Employee Stock Ownership Plan Fund (Aerospace and Defense Company)
 
After: Maxing 401 (K) contributions with mix of 8% Pre-tax and 11% Roth (total of $19,500/year)
· 60% S&P Index Equity fund
· 30% ESOP Fund
· 10% Target Date fund
 
Plan:  Keep current mixed contributions with 60/30 split going into S&P and ESOP because they have a low expense ratio (0.03%). Performance seems solid to me. I want to transfer the 10% Target Date Fund to a Self-Directed Brokerage Account (SDBA) from the employee 401 (K) and push it into VTI/VIG. The other options in the 401(K) is not worth investing in.
 
Thrift Savings Plan - Current Value: $15K Pre-tax Contribution.

Before: - No longer able to contribute- Had this since 2008

· 100% G-Fund (Bonds)
 
After:

· 60% C-Fund – S&P 500 Index
· 40% S-Fund – DOW Jones Total Stock Market Index
 
Plan: The net expense of this is 0.04%. I plan on keeping it in here, however, for easier management I might move it over to the new IRA SDBA account and invest in similar Index Funds.

Mutual Funds – Current Value ~$100K (Brokerage account)

After: No contributions since 2015
· 6.8% PRWCX – Capital Appreciation Fund
· 9.9% PRMTX - Communications & Technology
· 22.5% PRHSX – Health Sciences
· 26.8% PRWAX – New America Growth Fund
· 23.8% PRNHX – New Horizons Fund
· 10.2% OTCFX – Small-Cap Stock Fund
 
Plan: I haven’t contributed anything to these mutual funds since 2015 after an initial investment of ~$45K. It grew in value based on dividends (avg. $600/year) and capital gain distributions (avg. $6000/year) which gets reinvested to their respective funds. Honestly, I just realized that I’ve been paying capital gain taxes of around 15%-20% on these distributions every year. This is what really prompted me to seek help. Should I slowly move these over to a traditional IRA for tax purposes? Between me and my wife we should be able to individually contribute $6K each/year. Please correct if my assumption is wrong. Our Adjusted Gross Income this year will be less than $193K.
 
Other Investments:
Now: Current hold shares of $AAPL (10), $DAL(230), and $VIG (54) in a regular brokerage account. Sold off $TSLA a couple of weeks ago, and plan on buying some $JPM, $VTI, $VIG through IRA SDBA account.
 
Overall Goal:
I want to accumulate enough dividend income to retire off, however, I would like to take advantage of growth investments. I’m currently saving around 30% of my paycheck into 401(K) and HSA. Emergency fund is greater $30K, probably too much in my opinion because I don’t have large expenses (house is paid-off). So, I can probably save/invest an additional 10-20% of my income. I'm okay if you guys tell me to go back to the drawing board and redo everything. It doesn’t look like I’m very diversified- majority of my current investment is in US stocks. Any advice would be appreciated.",8,0.9,1589937660.0

t3_grpelw,"Stocks are going up, but for how long?","Disclaimer: This post is purely speculative. 

As of the current pandemic, stocks have plummeted to lows we haven’t seen in a decade during a historically great bull market. Companies giving out dividends have slowed and some have cut them entirely with the possibility of them being restored being unknown; however, the markets have been going up for nearly a month or so and seem to continue to be climbing. Along with an increasingly healthy stock market, it is possible that companies who lowered or outright cut their dividends could soon bring them back to where they were prior to 2020. 

With this in mind, anyone who has invested for a notable amount of time should know that the stock market will always have ups and downs and is not entirely tied to the health of the economy. It is true that the stock market CAN be an indicator of the overall health of the economy, but is absolutely an entirely separate entity. Just because stores and companies (in the U.S. at least) are slated to begin reopening does not necessarily mean that, financially speaking, we will see an increased upturn in stocks. 

So what should we expect? Personally I could see stocks soar by perhaps 10% on average throughout the summer, maybe even more. But keep in mind that 2020 is an election year and nearly every election brings uncertainty in the markets. Normally roughly a week or so surrounding the election sees some stocks plummet and others rise with an eventual correction.

Honestly I forgot where I was going with this post as I was typing it, but do keep in mind these points as you continue to invest. It is still a good time to buy stocks, and those companies who have continued to pay out their normal dividends (I have LEG, RIO, and KO for example) should be considered highly valuable due to them having the ability to maintain success and viability despite everything else happening right now. 

What do you expect from the stock market throughout the remainder of the year? Share your thoughts!",4,0.75,1590604384.0

My thoughts are at their current prices, you can get 32 shares of MFA for one O (I know O is way more sturdy and safe) - which then equals $26.16 a year for your 32 MFA shares (assuming dividends come back) versus the $2.80 for one O share. 

FYI - current have shares of MFA and considering getting more and eventually some O as well.

t3_gvfb8y,The right psychology to success with dividends. Let's share experiences,"It's my second month in this adventure and I feel I'm facing my first mistake. It's the desire of high yields stocks over the slow and steady research about interesting business that yield lower. 

For example, I bought EPD, MO, T, BEN, OKE, XOM, PBA and some  others which seem enough safe but did very little research on most of them, just the enoigh to convince myself dividend is unlikely to get cut. 
I do more reasearch on other companies but then I think, aff, this yield sucks, the growth is not that good, I'm not going anywhere soon, I dont wan't to go under 7% avg yield.

I do my monthly deposit and damn, I cant wait to buy random shares from my watchlist and spending all my money on the riskier ones. PM, more MO, ENB, and then IBM cause I feel guilty and I'm getting too much exposed with energy and tabacoo. 

I mean, I don't think I bought crap stocks and making errors right now with my little account it's cheap but I fear my  impulsiveness and the consequences it might have in a future. 

Maybe the fact of having an excel that calculates where will I be financially in 20 years  at X% average yield and Y% avg growth kills me.  Makes playing the game so boring. Specially thinking this in the work, I need to stay here X years more before reaching financial freedom... These  KO JNJ and PG wont make it soon.

I'm non-USian, and I am only taxed at 15% on all dividends, whether they would be qualified or not in the US. It's a little more complicated than that of course, but you don't need to know the complications. I have access to pretty much all US stocks/ETFs, no options though.

My question is: how would this change your investing if this were the case?

My thinking thus far is that I should be heavy on things like US real estate, because the income to the REIT is tax-free but I don't have to pay the higher tax on the dividends, and CEFs, which don't have tax-free income but can use leverage to boost their returns (I'm ok with the extra risk), and a lot of their dividends are non-qualified, but of course I'm only paying 15% tax.

t3_gw6nsa,"How I got to over $2,000 per month in dividends.","I agree with the recent post on this topic. It was high level and strategic, and people (myself included) wanted lower level details. So I wrote this. Maybe it will help someone.


Investing history

I have been investing for 30 years, mostly growth stocks and mutual funds. Took some big hits in '00 to '02, 50% loss one year. I avoided most of the '08 crash (got out with a 10% loss), the following bull market (only 20% in), and the March crash. For the last three months I have been moving my investments to earn dividends. I also control my wife's investments. She was 100% cash into the last crash, got lucky changing brokerages at the time.


Savings

Out of college we both worked and saved 10% of our salaries, after a few years she stayed home to raise three kids (for 18 years), she got back to work four years ago. I cut back 401k savings for five years and withdrew some 401k funds to pay off the house early. We both are back to saving 10% now. We both earn over $100k per year.


Financial summary

The two of us have put in $410k, and are getting $25,500 per year in dividends. This is $2,125 per month (averaged out, $1.2 to $2.6k is the range). We are earning 6.2% on our money. 


Investments 

Half of the funds are in dividend ETFs. About 10% are in dividend aristocrats or champions. I have 5% in gold, miners, and a flyer on $VTIQ. The rest could be considered ""chasing yields"" at some level. That is not popular here, and I may be about to learn another lesson the hard way, but it is working so far. I started with conservative investments then got more and more risky (chasing  yields).

The largest single investment is $MMP, at 8.6% of the portfolio. The most in one sector is oil at 11.2% of the portfolio. We have 30 different investments overall, and I am not typing them out.


Performance

Stock values are all up except $DHT. Oil is way up. That is good in case dividends are cut and I need to sell (at a profit) but it doesn't really matter. I am in this for income. I started with a goal of $12k per year and kept moving more funds into dividends. 


The plan

I plan on retiring in seven years. All the kids will be out of college. These dividends have bumped my retirement income by at least 25%. It will be 50% of my retirement income early on, before social security kicks in.

I am not using DRIP but taking the funds and buying other dividend stocks.


Managing

I have an excel sheet I track the portfolio with and analyze new investments. I use Yahoo Finance (website), TheRich (app) and TrackYourDividend (website) to help manage the portfolio.


Future

Keep doing this and increasing monthly income. So far I have kept buying new funds but may want to add to funds I already have. I like the safety it gives but  30 funds is a lot. I need to figure a regular schedule to verify dividends rather than just rely on notifications and sporadic checks myself.

This is my system. Let me know what you think, especially if you have suggestions to improve.

t3_gwzhv7,Dividend yield versus dividend payout,"Hi r/dividends,

I've been building a dividend portfolio over the last six months with an ultimate goal of generating $1,000 per month in dividend income, post-withholding tax.

Looking at my recent dividend payments, I've noticed that stocks with lower dividend yields are generating higher dividend amounts per share. For example, $JNJ has a dividend yield of 2.75%, and I received $1.01 per share in June. On the other hand, $EMR has a dividend yield of 3.17%, but I only received $0.50 per share in June.

I understand that dividend yield is a calculation to effectively analyze the health of the dividend and the underlying stock versus its price per share. While that certainly is important, why wouldn't most investors focus on the amount per share? Isn't that what ultimately matters to an income investor, the actual amount that they receive from the underlying stock in dividend payments?

t3_gydhlk,Opinions Wanted on our Dividend Plan,"Hi everyone, 

About a year ago I put together a dividend plan for myself and the significant other with the goal of eventually being able to pay our rent + utilities completely from dividends within 3-4 years. The plan is to eventually buy a house and pay the mortgage with dividends as well. I've been reading r/dividends for a while and I think getting some opinions on our dividend income plan from the community could only make it stronger, so I really appreciate you guys reading through this and poking holes or giving advice.

A little bit about us: We're two young professionals in our mid to late twenties. I make 110,000 +20,000 variable bonus / year, and the partner makes 90,000 + a variable amount of RSUs a year. I am debt free and my partner only has 1600 left on their student loans.  Our rent combined is 1800/month and our utilities are usually 100-200 a month depending on the season (winter heating bills are high).

Basically our total rent + utilities expenses are essentially 2000/month max, or 24,000 a year.

I tried to diversify our dividend plan by industry and weight towards stocks I felt more comfortable with based on their history and price volatility. I assumed that everything we buy will be put on a DRIP for the next 3-4 years so our number of shares that we own should snowball over time. I included some stocks we already owned in the plan (like $AAPL and $ADI) since they do pay some dividend, even though its kind of low. I also tried to include stocks that had cheaper prices (prices lower than 100) so we could buy more shares every month. We're planning on investing 3000-4000 dollars a month in the below plan:

Alright, first time – long time. Many thanks for the knowledge I have gained from following. This is a wonderful community that I appreciate and hope to be able to contribute too thoughtfully in the future.

I am recently divorced and rebuilding my portfolio. TSP/Roth(Fidelity)/Standard IRA(Edward Jones) intact and conservatively invested based on principles from John Bogle and Benjamin Graham or whatever Edward Jones decides…it’s just for the match. I have a Webull account that I use for testing my thoughts and to appease the gambler side that always wants more based on the time I won a trifecta while stationed in Turkey receiving a large duffle bag of hyper-inflated lira; usually the p/l on this account is in the red which is to be expected but it’s for fun.

Back to my point of posting which is the taxable account also through Fidelity. I am building this on a platform of $FXAIX (Fidelity’s S&P 500 Index u/15%), $FREL (Fidelity’s Real Estate ETF@20%) and $FAGIX (Fidelity Capital & Income Fund u/20%) currently making me a 4.09% Yield on Cost or $963 a year. 

From the drop during March, I have also acquired 5 shares of $BRKB (because fuck it it’s Buffett I’ve always wanted it and it gets me %10 off Geico), 10 shares of $GILD (still smh and praying) and 150 shares of $VZ ($T guys sorry but debt and DirectTV; Yahoo was stupid and I agree but 5G).

I am looking for dividends to cover my expenses. I am working my way down annualized bills and allocating the best dividend stocks in the same sector to cover these expenses while forcing myself to become diversified and not just $PG and high yield REITS. The platform and $VZ have me covered on subscriptions and my cell bill. Next to tackle are my utilities. I’ll do the DD and tinker with choices in Webull, obviously welcoming any suggestions but primarily I’m asking do you believe this to be a good approach?

I’m nervous as all get out writing this, not sure if this might help someone or if everyone is going to point and laugh at me like the time I dressed up and danced as Pee Wee Herman to “Tequila” in my 3rd grade talent show.",3,0.81,1591671190.0

I'd also like to say that the stocks at the bottom are not trash in my opinion. I own all these holdings but like everyone else, we have ones that we are more excited about than others.

Lastly for those of you that ask why I own so many holdings its mainly because I want my own index fund. Although I love MSFT as a stock I don't want 5% of my money in it with a 32 P/E, this is just one example of why I don't own VOO/SPY. I also think its easier to get motivated when I average 7 dividend payments a week with my profolio.

Since starting with 5k in Apr I’ve doubled my investment to 11k mainly teaching myself options and penny’s along the way with dividend investments being my ultimate goal. Upon discovering CMCM dividend announcement of 1.4/share I decided to initially buy 1,000 shares with the ex date coming up, this last week after a few days of dips I’ve upped my position to 2,500 shares with intentions of maximizing my position at 3,500 shares if I am able to before the ex date. However lately I’ve been reading around and noticing a lot of suspicion from veteran investors around the integrity of this dividend announcement of 1.40/share ultimately eluding it as misleading and not the true case of what investors in CMCM can expect from their dividend payout. If anyone has any information that they have on my position, or any critiques aswell I am open to listen! Abandoning this play and position seems to be the action I may need to take on Monday as I already have a 10% return I could pull need be when market opens, however I’d hate to obviously incur an “emotional” sale and miss out on 1.40/share on my minimal stake of 2,500 shares because of some phony information.

My idea is to move this savings into an M1 Finance account where I have roughly $500 invested at the moment. By doing this move I would open up the chance of taking $7,000 out on margin.

With that margin my idea was to use it to pay off the $6,000 that I still owe on my vehicle at 6% interest. I would then take the 270 a month saved from the car payment and put back into the M1 account either by paying off the margin when the stock market is high or invest back into my dividend portfolio when the market is low.

t3_hbl6b6,Uncovering Covered Calls: A 2 Year Search Of The Best Income Generating ETFs On The TSX,"My attempt at explaining what Covered Call Strategy is, and how it generates higher yields for income investors.

# Enhancing Dividend Yield With Covered Calls

In our 2 year search for the best ETFs on the TSX, we stumbled upon ETFs with covered calls strategy.

We'd research a specific Fund Manager like BMO, check out the fact sheet of an ETF which holds the Major Canadian Banks at a dividend yield of approx. 4.5%. This alone is a quality investment for passive income + growth. Great! End of research, just invest in this and we're good. But then, a couple of more clicks and we see the same Fund Manager (BMO), with a similar ETF holding the same Major Canadian Banks but this one has a dividend yield of approx 7% (ZWB as of June 1st, 2020).  As income investors, this is very interesting..

## How?

ETF ZWB uses a covered call strategy. Before we get into what a covered call strategy is, let's look at why it exists, and why you should include them in your portfolio.

# Why A Need For Covered Calls.

According to Bloomberg reports from March 31st, 2020,  and additional sources: Forbes, MoneyShow, Investopedia

There is a steady decline in available investments that provide dividend yields. This means people are looking for new ways to access money in the marketplace, meaning there is a demand to improve strategies to make money on the stock market by enhancing dividend yields. This strategy offers investors additional income solutions to complement their portfolio and really boost dividend passive income.

# Why Choose Covered Calls? 

* The covered call strategy is used on **Quality Dividend Growers.** These are dividend investments you already want, because of all the good reasons. (large-cap, safe, reliable, blue-chip, dividend payout steadily grows over time) 
* These are the investments you make for the long term and to get rich slowly while collecting income
* The Covered Call strategy **Lowers Volatility** (the action taken in the strategy generates more income for the investor without subjecting investor to added risk)
* The Covered Call Strategy creates **Higher Dividend Yield** (a difference of 2 or 3% is significant for income investors)
* The Covered Call strategy provides **Tax Efficient** income compared to Capital Gains
* The **ETF Management fee** compared to Index ETFs is well worth it for **Income Investors**

# What is a Covered Call?

Covered calls are a very interesting income enhancement strategy because unlike a lot of the other income enhancing strategies out there, (ex: leverage). Covered Call strategy doesn't come with additional risk, in fact, it lowers risk than just holding the securities (stocks) outright. 

**Covered Calls give you more yield without the added risk**

## So What is it?

It's simply holding a basket of stocks (ETF) and then selling call options against some of the stocks in that portfolio (basket). What the Fund Manager does when selling a call option is they choose a price at some point in the future, and by selling that option to a potential buyer, you receive a premium. That premium is the yield enhancement to your overall portfolio.

**Example:** ETF Owner (that's us) owns units of an ETF for 10$ a share Fund Manager of the ETF uses Covered Call StrategyFund Manager sells a Call Option on 100 shares in that ETF

Looks like ThisCall option = For a Premium of 25 cents per share, I will sell you 100 shares at $11 a share **if** the Stock Price goes above $11 within 30 days. (Strike price here is $11)

**Outcome# 1: Stock price goes down after 30 days:**Good for us the owners of the ETF as the Call Option expires worthless and we keep the premium of 25 cents per share ($25 total for this call option)Although you're not too happy the stock price goes down, you just softened the blow because at least you made a commission in the form of that Call Option Premium, plus as a passive income investor, you're glad to just hold on to the stock for the long term anyway.

**Outcome# 2: Stock price stays the same after 30 days:**Good for us as the option expires worthless and we keep the premium again. ($25 for this call option )

**Outcome# 3: Stock price goes up (above the strike price) after 30 days:**In this case: we are obliged to sell the stocks at the strike price, in this case, $11. But make a small profit in doing so as we bought the shares for one price and selling it at a higher price + we get the Call Option Premium. However, this can limit the potential for more upside since the stock can continue to rise (if the stock is above 11$ for example)

## What's the Trade-Off?

You've traded away the excess capital gain of that stock which limits potential growth in exchange for that premium which is the enhanced income. But since ETF manager uses this strategy for large-cap, blue-chip stocks that are stable, the agreed-upon price or strike price has to be higher than the price it was at the time of the Call Option, which isn't too often as the stock is stable. 

In addition, ETF managers use their own proprietary strategy to ensure some upside is captured regardless  (Example: BMO manages to capture about 50% of the upside if the option is exercised)

It sounds confusing, luckily the Fund Managers handle all of this, while we take the **Lazy Person** approach and just sit back and get enhanced income. 

**The Bottom Line:**This strategy is specifically tailored for **Income Investors** who are willing to trade some potential upside gain in the future for more income right now. I hope this helps to clarify was Covered Call Strategy is!",16,1.0,1592508478.0

I realize it dropped significantly from previous highs. My understanding is if you get in now(ish) near lows:
- it has an excellent annual dividend

t3_hd94si,Dividend Stocks vs. Dividend ETFs,"Hello all, I am still learning the ways of stocks, ETFs, and of course dividends. Through browsing this sub, I see many people recommend dividend stocks. Overall stocks tend to be risky compared to ETFs, but many of the recommended stocks are stable and long hold stocks which provide decent dividends in return. 

My question is why are not dividend ETFs not recommended more around here? ETFs are usually more stable. They are of course more diversified which provides stability. They are able to provide similar dividend yields or sometimes higher than dividend stocks. Dividend ETFs do tend to have lower growth compared to the stock, but if it had a higher dividend yield, why not? 

When seeing dividend portfolios, I often see 1-2 ETFs and rest being stocks. Not to say that is bad, but why not more ETFs? I remember seeing a post awhile ago about like 20 different strong dividend ETFs, but I can’t seem to find that post again. I put all of those onto my watchlist and check on those as well as check into the recommended stocks many of you have.

I am a 24 years old who just graduated and started my first job. For now and the next years, I can invest 900$ each month into stocks. My plan is to build a portfolio for the (at least) 20 next years.

I started to educate myself on stocks, and I would like an advice from you. For a long term run, what is the best strategy for you :

* buying dividends ETFs, for example from this [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/h8yvan/our_2_year_hunt_of_the_30_best_etfs_on_the_tsx/). These ETF have an annual 6-12% return. 
* stockpicking dividends stock, as many people on this sub do. In average, people who share their portfolio have an annual return of 4-6%.
* stockpicking companies in which I believe, which will grow in value during next 10 years, but which don't necessarly pay dividends.
* Other options ?

By looking at this list of options, my opinion is that dividend ETFs look like the best option : they have a good yield, and are the least time consuming.

t3_hehxhl,Optimal Dividend Portfolio Setup,"I'm just starting on dividend investing. I've been lurking around this board for a few months now and could use some guidance on an optimal investment strategy.   I currently have $1700 in a Etrade account I'm personally managing and $850 in M1Finance account automatically investing in dividend etfs along with a few other long, medium term assets such as bonds.   Both are in standard accounts and not in retirement accounts. 

I've read in numerous posts here and other resources, the best way to reduce  taxes and optimize my gains is to have my portfolios in a Roth IRA.  

1. Would moving all my accounts to a Roth be the best direction? 
2. Looking online max Roth contribution is about $5500, so would I deposit up to that amount and do a standard account for anything I want to contribute outside of that amount? I was planning to deposit $500 a month, which ends up totaling $6000 which is over the limit.  
3. If switching to a Roth from a non-retirement account is the only way to do that to sell my stocks and deposit the cash into my Roth for reinvestment?
4. Are there any platforms that might be better suited for my need other than ETrade and M1Finance?

t3_hgz2z1,Selling Covered Calls to Supplement Dividends and boost your CAGR.,"Hi r/dividends. This is one of my favorite investing subs, but I think a lot of people here could be doing more to grow their portfolio by using covered calls so this is my little write up...

In summary, a covered call is an options trading strategy where you provide the collateral required for someone else’s call option. 

When someone buys a call option, they pay a set price called a premium that grants them the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a fixed price (strike price) and sell them for whatever the price is on a fixed date (strike date). 

For example, the current price of BAC is $23.07.  An example call could be a $25c 7/2 for $0.25, meaning the contract holder has the right to buy 100 shares of BAC at $25 each and sell them at whatever price BAC is at on 7/2. Since the contract represent 100 shares, the premium paid is 100 x $0.25= $25. 

So, if BAC reaches $27, the contract holder could buy and sell 100 x (27-25)= $200, but they also paid $25 for the premium so net profit is $175. However, if BAC is only $24 on 7/2 then the call option expires worthless because the strike price was not achieved and the contract holder still loses the premium they paid.

Now, as a dividend investor with 100 shares of BAC myself, I can sell these call options to other people. I pick my own strike price and strike date and submit my 100 shares as collateral for a call option. In return, I get to keep the premium paid no matter what. So if I sell a $27c 7/2 and it expires worthless, I get to keep my shares and the premium the customer paid so I’m +$25 without selling any shares. 

As a dividend investor, your priority is to never sell and keep collecting premiums for as long as possible, so you may want to choose strike prices and strike dates that are very far from the current price in order to ensure that you get to keep your shares. So in reality you might want to sell a $30c 7/2 for only $0.10, but it will likely expire worthless so you still net $10. 

I’ve been selling covered calls on my 400 shares of  BAC and have collected $120 in premiums by selling weekly contracts in just 1 month which I immediately put back into $BAC to buy 4 more shares. My total cost of 400 BAC shares is $10,000, and I yielded 120/10000= 1.2% in premiums within the month.

Let me know what you think of this or if you have any questions. I have a spreadsheet tracking my covered calls if there’s any interest in seeing that too.",10,0.86,1593283798.0

t3_hiswtq,"Robinhood officially took Chesapeake Energy (CHK) off their app. My thoughts, along with 3 rival companies whose stocks could jump as a result.","After CHK filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy (realigning funding within the company due to debts, from my understanding) their stock froze and, as of this morning, have officially disappeared off the Robinhood platform. 

I find this quite interesting for a number of reasons. First, being from Oklahoma (the state Chesapeake Energy is based in), it brings up questions about where the company will go, if it attempts to continue production after having filed for bankruptcy. The company brought over 2k jobs to the state and the OKC Thunder stadium is currently called Chesapeake Energy Arena. As someone from the state and the presence of a professional sports team still being relatively new, it’s brought the state to a somewhat unprecedented circumstance. Honestly I don’t know what all would happen with all of this. If anyone has seen this occur in your local neighborhood or city, please let me know in the comments, I would be highly interested in reading your thoughts. 

Second, if the company survives and continues production, will it be listed as a penny stock that could be worth buying into as soon as it returns? If it does make a comeback and is extremely cheap, it may be worth dropping like $20 or so into a number of extremely cheap stocks to see if the price surges after investors see the company actually did make a return. Then selling at a higher price, perhaps a much higher price if things go extremely well. CHK being a part of the energy sector, it seems a bit unlikely to me that an energy company would just completely collapse after a single bankruptcy (I’m not an expert on these types of situations, but originally being a local of this company’s market, this brings a unique possibility of positives and negatives in my mind).

Third and final, this could give a boost to a number of other energy companies local to Oklahoma. With homes and businesses relying on this company for energy, other local companies could be sweeping in and increasing their customer base. Some companies include Devon Energy (DVN, which in my mind is probably the most successful energy company in OKC, seeing how their main offices are the lone skyscraper in Oklahoma City. A bit shallow of course, but it’s a prominent figure in the kinds of locals) Continental Resources (CLR), and Sandridge Energy (SD). It will be very interesting to see if any of these companies’ stock values jump if Chesapeake can’t or simply doesn’t make a come back.

Thoughts?

* **Unilever** (10.46USD/**9,17 EUR**)
* **Johnson & Johnson** (5.14USD/**4.61 EUR**)
* **Archer Daniels Midland** (7.58USD/**6.62 EUR**)

t3_hk2pdv,Here's My Spreadsheet for Filtering Div Stocks,"Howdy people. I'm relatively new to dividend investing, and probably like a lot of people around here I've been researching ways to hopefully pick good dividend paying stocks to hold long term.

I'm also a software developer, so I created a Google sheet with a script to fetch data from a couple of APIs, populate some fields, and filter out stocks based on criteria that make sense to me. It also gives me a lint to the Seeking Alpha dividend page for that stock.

It's late here, and I'm sleepy, so take that into consideration when you're reading this! It's turned into quite a long post.

Anyway, the spreadsheet looks like this (this screenshot has the 'filter' sheet missing though):

[All the data is fetched from IEX Cloud and Google Finance \(apart from the tickers themselves\)](https://preview.redd.it/daa8mdskdh851.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b61a30d29bdc77802eac20c19c42dde94f8aeec)

I guess it'd be irresponsible of me not to include the 'bigger-picture' advice, and other things I considered before and during using this to make decisions. My investing plan is basically dividend growth; so long-term holding (20+ years), and I care more about the company's fundamentals, qualitative factors, and dividend and financial history than I do about the stock price on any given day (although I'll definitely by companies I like when they're cheap!). Also, if you're a Brit like me, between 18 and 40, and have similar investing goals to me, then get a Lifetime ISA and put £4,000 in it every year before buying any stocks. The government will give you 25% on top up to £1000 per year. Can't beat guaranteed 25% return on £4k. Unfortunately, I'm British, but not a UK tax resident, so I can't do that. If I could, that's what I'd do before even looking at the stock market.

**EDIT:** Someone from /r/UKInvesting asked about the Lifetime ISA (LISA), and I realised that I forgot to actually say what the Lifetime ISA is good for! (I think I mentioned I was sleepy when I wrote this :) ) A Lifetime ISA gives you a 25% bonus each year (up to £1,000) for you to spend either on your first home, *or* for retirement. You can contribute to a LISA until you're 50, but not withdraw from it for retirement until you're 60. You can withdraw from it any time to help buy a first home. And you can contribute to a LISA and a regular ISA, and even a Help To Buy ISA (if you opened one before they were stopped) in the same tax year, as long as your total ISA contributions don't go over the yearly limit, which is £20,000 for 2020-2021. Lastly, if you have a LISA and a Help to Buy ISA, you can only use one for helping to buy your first home. So long story short, if you're investing for the long-term, I'd say open a LISA and stick your first £4,000 of investment money each year in that...

Anyway, I thought I'd share my spreadsheet and script with the community in the hope that it's useful, and that hopefully people can feed into it and suggest improvements.

[Here's the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_V0ofdoRzCWGZtV8ksuPF85cS8iM-JN9wdGrgQaFBZ8/edit?usp=sharing)

[And here's the script you need](https://pastebin.com/X5P4vBaX)

You'll also need to get one or more API keys from [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/). It's free, and no, I have nothing to do with them. It's probably better to get a few keys by signing up a few times with different email addresses. Otherwise there's a good chance you'll max out your API call quota for a given API key. You only need to confirm the email address, and they'll give you the API key straight after, so don't worry about remembering all the email addresses and passwords you use. Also, don't tell them I told you to do this. ;)

There's a place to put all the API keys at the top of the script. It should be pretty straight forward, just make sure they're all in single or double quotes, and that they're separated by commas.

Once the sheet and script are set up, the workflow I use is pretty speedy to weed out stocks I'm not interested in owning:

* Grab a list of tickers that your broker sells (I'm a Brit so use Trading212 and Freetrade, but I guess most brokers will have a list of the instruments they have available)
* Paste the list of ticker symbols into the sheet (symbols only! Only edit column B of the first sheet)
* Adjust the filter criteria in the second sheet (min dividend, payout ratio range, max P/E ratio, and min EPS)
* From the resulting filtered stocks, follow the Seeking Alpha link of each one to check out more info, like dividend growth over time, dividend news, and financials like total revenue over time.

I can make a rough yes / no decision with this technique in probably about 30 seconds per stock. Maybe I'm missing some important things, so please say if you think this is a stupid idea - I'm here to learn!

If you're not well versed with Google sheets then it might not be totally obvious how to set it all up. I'll run though the basic steps, and then give a more detailed walk through after:

* Copy the sheet linked above so you can edit it.
* Sign up a few times to IEX Cloud and get some API keys
* Go to Tools -> Script Editor
* Paste the code from the second link above into the script. Delete anything that's already in the script (I think there's a default \`myFunction()\` thing - delete that and anything else before pasting my code
* Save the script. You'll probably have to create a new project too - call it whatever you want, doesn't matter.
* Still in the script editor, go to Edit -> Current Project's Triggers
* Click 'Add Trigger' in the bottom right
* Set 'Choose which function to run' to 'getData'
* 'Choose which deployment should run' will be 'Head' (only choice)
* 'Select event source' should be 'From Spreadsheet'
* 'Select event type' should be 'On Edit'
* Then set 'Failure notification settings' to whatever you want. I have mine on daily.
* Click 'Save'.
* You'll have to give permission for the script to interact with your sheet (maybe another coder on here can verify that my code doesn't do anything evil)

That's it! Now you can go to the 'Watch List' sheet, add a ticker into column B, and the script will fill in all the other data. Sometimes it's a little slow, and some data might be missing, but it's mostly there for the good stocks.

Then go to the filter sheet and you'll see a bunch of filtered dividend stocks based on the criteria in the left column. Of course you can edit these to your heart's content!

Then if you want you can click through to Seeking Alpha and see more info, like how long they've been paying dividends for, have their payments been growing, how are their financials etc? In the future I'd like to skip this step and have all that info in the sheet itself as part of the filter. But the APIs I've used don't give me that info (for free, at least), and I don't have much time to dig around for a better solution at the moment.

Anyway, I hope it's useful! I'd love to know what you think!

And for those who like to follow along with pictures, here are the same steps with screen shots:

Copy the sheet linked above so you can edit it:

Save the script. You'll probably have to create a new project too - call it whatever you want, doesn't matter.

Set 'Choose which function to run' to 'getData'

'Choose which deployment should run' will be 'Head' (only choice)

'Select event source' should be 'From Spreadsheet'

'Select event type' should be 'On Edit'

Then set 'Failure notification settings' to whatever you want. I have mine on daily.

Click 'Save'.

That's it! Then you can go to the sheet and paste in as many ticker symbols as you like. In theory there shouldn't be a limit, but it gets slow if you paste in more than a few hundred at a time. Just give it some breathing room :)

t3_hkms32,A lurker hiding behind the tree comes out to talk,"I’ve been a lurker for a little while on this subreddit and I think now is a good time to come out and start to interact with the people of this subreddit. A little back story: Just yesterday my dog was attacked by GVD but thank God he survived. However, my bank account is now severely injured and will take a lot of time to recover. As a college student, this was a massive blow to my financial situation as I cannot work more than one job and do college at the same time, it just doesn’t work for me. Back story ended. 

Why I am here: I usually study and experiment with the subject of interest myself and get help when in a pickle. Now, I don’t feel like I have that time. *I’m asking this subreddit today of what dividend stocks I should invest in to get some cash coming my way.*

What I have: $300 isn’t much and I can bump that number up if highly recommended (I know that really isn’t enough), but that number was more of a tinkering number. Robinhood is my main app I use. 

I have had my eye on $KO and $OKE for a little while because they look good (also because that 18 year old on this subreddit who posted recently had them in his portfolio), but because of my limited knowledge of the stock market, there might be more under the hood that I am not aware of that could spell danger.

I have had a look at a few high yield stocks such as $IRM, $AGNC, $XOM however I'm hesitant to even put a small percentage of my portfolio into such stocks looking at the falling share prices over time.

t3_hl3i8c,Thoughts on FDHY - High Yield Bond ETF,"I’ve lurked on this sub for a while and thought I’d finally ask a question. So I am a long term investor in my 401K and IRA I have a couple of brokerage accounts that I trade options and futures in. So I’m not a total noob.

I had an idea a while back, since even HY savings accounts are crap and really don’t beat or even get close to inflation that I would move my savings to a long term, low risk brokerage account that focused on stable returns, with good dividends to make up about a 5-7% annual return. 

The reason for this was two fold, one I would like my emergency funds and long term savings to make a good return and I don’t need the money instantly. I can wait the 3 days if I need to cash it out. 

So, I set out and did a lot of research and landed on a couple of low fee ETFs. FBND & FDHY - both Fidelity ETFs with a positive NAV over the long term. They both pay monthly dividends. So I started out with FBND and held it for about three months up until the market crash. My thought for going with bond ETF‘s over the actual bond is the liquidity and the ability to exit at any time. My other thought was bonds are much more stable than equities. I found FDHY after the market and crashed and was able to buy and relatively cheap somewhere around $40 per share. It pays about a $.20-$.21 dividend per share per month. And is up already around between 3 and 5% depending on where the market wants to move. 

My second move was to put it in Coca-Cola, so half the portfolio is in Coca-Cola and the other half is in FDHY. Both roughly stabilize around the $40-$50 mark and pay a solid dividend unchanged since it’s open. 

My question is what are your thoughts around the strategy and what are your thoughts on these particular ETFs?",9,0.91,1593870147.0

T or Ko- because they are stable companys that will probably never go away and are both on sale.

Sphd - havnt done much looking into ETFs yet, but this one seems popular

Xom - because oil usually recovers and everything uses it including ev

Bpy - seems like a stable buy for property

The down fall of this method that I can see would be paying a higher tax on selling assets held under a year and you also can't account for the stocks overall price fluctuation.

t3_hobxi7,Noob question here.,"Hi

Noob question here, im following autodesk (ADSK). Im looking at the financials and slightly confused by one thing. 

The EPS (TTM) is 1.36 and share price is 248.20. So trailing P/E ratio is 248.20/1.36= 182.5 which adds up. 

They already have a value for the forward p/e as 46.

The forward P/E is the, share price divided by the expected earnings per share for the year. So if i add up the eps for the 2020 quarters, q1 is 0.92, q2 is 0.85, q3 is 0.89 (estimated), where is the estimated value of the Q4?  Or where does the estimated eps come from does it come before first quartly report or does it take into account the q1, q2 and then estimates the rest. 

For the forward P/E to be 46, the eps is going to have to go up 5.38 times if share price stays the same. Or do they account for share price increase also. ??

t3_hob4ei,Why the **** is $T so popular?!?,"So I have been involved in this subreddit for a while now and have been able to observe many trends or commonalities in all of your portfolios.  Most of the time you all are doing pretty well, or at least I think so. However, there are a few things that keep popping up in this group that I whole-heartedly disagree with, and today I want to share one with you all and get your opinions.

I’m talking about $T.  $T is probably one of the more common dividend stocks that I’ve seen on here and I just can’t for the life of me understand why.  First off, I’d like to start with some financial ratios and metrics because I’m a financial analyst as my day job (at JPMorgan) and thats what we look at first. Here are some that I’ve pulled out in particular for you all:



$T 



Dividend Yield: 		6.83%

Payout Ratio: 			104.12%

Div. Coverage Ratio: 		96.05%

3yr Div. Growth Rate: 		2.0%

10yr Div. Growth Rate: 		2.1%

Profit Margin (PM):  		8.70%

Cash Flow/Share (TTM): 		$5.99

Current Ratio (CR): 		0.76


So these are just a few that I wanted to pick out and highlight as reasons why I would never suggest investing in $T right now.  First, lets take a look at the Payout Ratio.  Seeing a payout of over 100% is extremely concerning to me right off the bat and this alone would usually keep me from investing.  This payout means its paying out more money in dividends than it’s making as a company.  Next, the Dividend Coverage Ratio, which is almost the opposite formula from the payout ratio.  For $T, the dividend coverage ratio is only 96.05%, which means that its earnings can only cover 96% of the dividends it pays.  This again is extremely concerning.  Next, when we look at the dividend growth rate on paper with no context, 2% and 2.1% is solid. However, when we consider the fact that this growth has overtaken $T’s net income growth, so it is now paying out more than it makes, this is very concerning for the viability of the dividend going forward.

With all of that being said, it is hard for most people to gain insight based purely off of those numbers above with no context, since most people don’t sit in front of a computer looking at company financials and data like I do.  So in order to give you all some context, I have put together the corresponding information for a few of $T’s biggest competitors, namely $VZ and $BCE.



$VZ


Dividend Yield: 		4.44%

Payout Ratio: 			55.06%

Div. Coverage Ratio: 		181.62%

3yr Div. Growth Rate:		2.2%

10yr Div. Growth Rate: 		2.6%

Profit Margin (PM): 		14.4%

Cash Flow/Share (TTM): 		$8.58

Current Ratio (CR): 		0.99




$BCE


Dividend Yield: 		5.99%

Payout Ratio: 			96.05%

Div. Coverage Ratio: 		104.12%

3yr Div. Growth Rate:		5.1%

10yr Div. Growth Rate: 		7.1%

Profit Margin (PM): 		13.36%

Cash Flow/Share (TTM): 		$6.10

Current Ratio (CR): 		0.88


So now that you all have some context on $T’s performance, you can clearly see that, in some of the most important metrics for dividends and profitability, $T is behind 2 of its main competitors.  The only metric/ratio that $T is better in is its dividend yield, which is concerning because its long-term profitability is very much at question and this could greatly jeopardize its dividend going forward.

I believe that a lot of people see that almost 7% dividend and the big, established name of $T and think “It must be safe because they’ve been around a long time and always grow their dividend.”  But a deeper look into their financials shows that this is not the case at all.

So I want to pose the question to you all: Now that you have seen this, what are your thoughts on $T?  Will you still invest in it?  Will you sell your current shares?  Will you conduct further research on your own?  All opinions are welcome and I’d love to hear whatever you have to say.",145,0.94,1594328058.0

For the sake of brevity, I will not be analyzing companies that are already in my portfolio, as I do not want to sound like a broken record.

>Bristol Myers Squibb Co. ($BMY)

On paper, this company is doing well.  Solid revenue growth.  Unfortunately, this is dramatically overshadowed by the faults in the dividend.  Healthcare is a very fragile industry.  This is reflected in $BMY's net income, which fluctuates massively from year to year. Profits can evaporate on a dime, which is why companies need to keep a very close eye on their dividends and payout ratios, lest they take on debt they cannot afford. $BMY does not seem to understand this principle.  In 2015, their payout ratio was 158.27%.  In 2017 their payout ratio was 255.91%.  As of Q2 2020, their trailing twelve month payout ratio is a whopping 317.30%.  Considering that revenue and the gross profit margin have grown every single year since 2015, a picture begins to paint itself of what is happening.

I understand trying to maintain one's dividend, but it has to be done sustainably.  This company is listing itself as having around $50 billion in debt.  With a debt to equity ratio of 96%, this company has a higher ratio than AT&T!  This is incredibly dangerous, and the board does not seem to care.  A 40% D/E ratio is considered high.  96% is stratospheric and growing.

From my outsider perspective, it looks like a hard dividend cut is in this company's future.  The dividend is rising faster than profits, executive compensation is way higher than industry averages for a company of this size, shareholders are being diluted.  This company is setting course for either bankruptcy court or a dividend cut.  Considering the underlying revenue and gross profit margins of the company are strong, the latter option seems more likely.

Recommended replacement: Amgen

>AmerisourceBergen Corporation ($ABC)

There are many facets of the healthcare industry.  Among them, drug distribution is not the place you want to be right now.   AmerisourceBergen is currently being sued by every state and their mother right now due to the company's role in the opioid epidemic currently plaguing rural America.  I could sit here all day and explain the horrible actions this company took, but if people care about that, they can read the lawsuits.  Let's talk about the numbers.

Over the past five years, revenue has grown by around $40 billion, but the company's profit has remained stagnant at around $1billion.  In 2019, the company generated around $180 billion in revenue.  The company turned that $180 billion into 855 million in profit.  To put that in perspective, $ABC has a net profit margin of 0.47%.  That margin is not small, it is not tiny, it could barely even be called razor thin.  The most accurate term would be microscopic.

Recommended Replacement: Medtronic

>  National Retail Properties and Federal Realty Investment Trust

Fine investments.  The only problem is FRT's payout ratio is too high for me personally.  Retail is being hammered by this pandemic, but if these guys survive, they will be excellent investments.

&#x200B;

>LTC Properties

I hate stagnant dividends with a burning passion.  As long as inflation exists, stagnant dividends will be something I despise.

Recommended replacement: Essex Property Trust

&#x200B;

>Bank OZK

While I am typically a big fan of regional banks, I do not hold the highest opinion of those who like stock splits.  OZK has done two in the past ten years alone.  With the advent of fractional share purchases, stock splits are effectively obsolete.  I would not advise against this stock, but I personally am hesitant.  I like how insiders hold a very sizable portion of the company, but the amount of shareholder dilution is concerning.

Recommended replacement: Stock Yards Bancorp

&#x200B;

>Discover Financial Services

This company seems more focused on its dividend than actually growing its business.  If we were talking about a utility, that would be fine.  Unfortunately, this is a company with two massive competitors (Visa and Mastercard) who would prefer their industry to remain a duopoly.  When you are a small player challenging not one, but two fin-tech giants, growth should be a priority, especially since V and MA still consider themselves growth companies, hence why their payout ratios are so low.  

Recommended replacement: An equal portion of V and MA.

&#x200B;

>Wells Fargo

I've made the case against Wells Fargo before, so I won't make myself out to be a broken record on the subject, but long story short, I would not consider buying into this stock until the entire board has been replaced.  This company has been mismanaged for years at this point and has nothing to show for it.  Interest revenue has grown by over $15 billion in the past five years, but the company has shed about $3 billion in net interest profits over the same time.  Based upon the data, it seems that Wells Fargo was taking on higher risk revenue streams.  This is reflected in the soaring interest revenue on loans and borrowings the company collected, but the decline in non-interest revenue.  These and other data points paint a picture that suggests clients who are in a less financially secure position were getting larger loans at higher interest rates. It works only as long as your clients are employed.  


Then we have the lawsuits and the fraud, which brought down consumer interest in the bank.  New customer signups dropped off a cliff.  To cover up this shortfall and prevent the dividend from coming under pressure, the company ramped up its share buybacks.  This is why the company's stock price stagnated.  Not because they were doing anything innovative to make the stock worth holding, they simply just began buying back shares.  

In the part of the country where I live, Wells Fargo used to be seen as the definitive place to get your mortgage.  The local branch was willing to match any other bank's offer.   Looking at mortgage revenue today, we see it cut by 2/3rds over the past five years.  All of this can be combined and you can see why the dividend was forced to be cut.  All of this was entirely preventable.  

Is the company in a better state now than in 2009?  Honestly hard to say.  The damage is that bad.  You could be a billionaire on paper, but if you are only a billionaire because you own 1 billion $1 coffee mugs, then your wealth doesn't really mean anything.  If all your clients will declare bankruptcy the second the stimulus money runs out, you will be in for a wild ride.

>Walgreens Boots Alliance

I used to be very pessimistic about this company.  As a retail manager, every instinct in me says this company is on the wrong path.  However, management seems like they are trying to clean the place up.  If they succeed, this will be a great holding to have.  If not, I would get out while you can.

>McDonald's

In my personal opinion, speaking as a manager at Cracker Barrel, franchising is a horrible and outdated business model.  To sum up the problem with franchises in one word, it would be ""loyalty,"" more specifically the lack of it.  Everyone involved in a franchise operation is out to make money, end of story.   Any manager on Earth will tell you that when employees do not care about their job, the entire business suffers.  I have yet to meet an individual who works at a franchise who actually cares about their job.  

In contrast, my employer Cracker Barrel refuses to franchise.  It is the second largest publicly traded restaurant company in the United States that does not franchise (second only to Chipotle).  The only thing stopping this company is the number of stores.  Cracker Barrel isn't even in all fifty states yet.  The company chooses to expand slowly and methodically.  There is a dedicated team of employees whose sole purpose is to open stores.  These employees (called 'red shirts') are hand picked from stores around the country and work collectively to make sure every new store opening is as smooth as possible.  Each and every one of them cares deeply about this company.  The vast majority of our employees care about this company.

I cannot tell you how many people start out working for us just as a summer or part time job, but then simply fall in love with this company and end up working here for their entire careers.  This company is legendary in the restaurant and retail industries for its retention rates.  We have employees and managers that have been with this company for decades.  Of course, most employees come and go.  College students who wait tables to pay for their degrees, hosts who simply need a summer job before their senior year of high school.  But every single store has its core.  The PAR IVs who are in this for the long haul.  They are the cornerstone of every store, and they work together like a well oiled machine.  The best servers in my store make over $50,000 a year, when the average check size is around $11.

This loyalty goes both ways. When the pandemic hit, corporate refused to lay anyone off and instead took out debt to give every employee two weeks of retention pay and to maintain manger's salaries.  The only people who got laid off were 22 District managers and 2 Regional Vice Presidents.  They were offered severance in exchange for early retirement.  Cracker Barrel took advantage of the pandemic to clean up its corporate structure and internal logistics network, and it paid off.  Last week, my store (restaurant+retail) made $90,000 in sales, because all our experienced employees never left.   

Speaking of corporate structure, another disadvantage of the franchise model.  Internal promotion is impossible.  No company would promote a franchise owner to be an executive.  However, when everyone already works for the company, internal promotion can become the default.  When a company internally promotes its best and brightest, you keep that talent inside the company.  It is physically impossible for someone who works outside Cracker Barrel to be hired as a District manager or Regional Vice President.  This company has found that external hires simply cannot compare to those internally promoted.  Managers undergo weeks of training at the company's headquarters in Lebanon, Tennessee, and the majority of external hires just can't handle it and drop out.  In fact, pretty much everyone at Home Office was internally promoted and used to work in a store.  It all comes back to actually caring about your job and the company you work for.

I could go on all day, but the numbers speak for themselves.  The average McDonald's generates roughly $1.1 million in revenue.  The average Cracker Barrel generates over $4.5 million per year.  I often get asked sarcastically if people actually buy the products we sell in retail.  The answer is yes.  If people do not want it, we do not sell it.  Retail makes up 20% of Cracker Barrel's total revenue.  In my store alone, my 20 employees (2 full time shift leaders, 3 full time, 13 part time, and 2 seasonal) we alone generate more revenue than the average McDonald's, and we are not even the largest store in our district (though granted we are an above average store).  I'm not allowed to give exact figures, but let's just say my manager bonus last year was very nice, and I reward my people.

To get back to McDonald's, its franchising is a hindrance to its own success.  Stores compete with each other, instead of working together.  This brings down the entire company, and we see falling revenue year over year.  This company has no real room to grow.  McDonald's has built a reputation for being dirty, unhealthy, and greedy. Unless the company can fix itself, it will be nothing but downhill.  

Recommended Replacement: Cracker Barrel.  Sadaar Biglari's idiotic war against the board has kept this company's share price stagnant for the past few years.  He ran steak n shake into the ground, and has been trying to force himself on CBRLs board since 2012.  In the process, he's nearly bankrupted his own company, while Cracker Barrel has continued to grow and thrive.   Once Biglari bankrupts himself into irrelevance, the stock price will begin growing again.

&#x200B;

>Best Buy

I think Best Buy needs to make some significant course corrections to prevent going the way of other retailers.  This pandemic is likely to single-handedly kill the concept of Black Friday and holiday shopping in person, which is where Best Buy makes about half of their net income for the year.  The business model of making all your profit in Q4 is not going to work in the 21st century.  Retailers like Target are successful because they make decent money year round, with the holidays simply being a bonus.  The company does not need the holidays to make a profit for the year.  

This is what the people who forecast the death of retail do not realize.  The kind of retail where you do all your business between October and December is going to die.  The kind of retail where all revenue is dispersed evenly, with smaller spikes in Q2 or Q4, that is what will generate the most returns.

Recommended replacement: Target

I have spent quite some time reading 10-k reports and doing other research but eventually, I ended up with this portfolio of 53 positions (as of now) of which 3 ETFs. Because of the sheer amount of importxml functions, they started breaking (I moved them to another sheet which helped but didn't solve the problem) so the forward yield on most stocks isn't available anymore (it was when there were less than 10 positions so it did work). It's not an actual portfolio yet but when I start my investing journey I plan on allocating my portfolio as shown in the sheet.

t3_hqgm9b,$AGM aka Farmer Mac Stock Analysis,"&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**

**1) Who/What is Farmer Mac?**

Farmer Mac - hereon referred to as AGM for the sake of abbreviation - is to the agricultural industry what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are to the home mortgage industry. For those unfamiliar, all three are considered **GSE's** (**Government-Sponsored Enterprises)**. 

2) **What does a GSE do?**

Basically GSE's act as secondary markets for mortgages and loans. In the primary market, a primary lender writes up a mortgage. This mortgage (or an asset of these mortgages) can then be sold to a secondary lender. The reason why these secondary lenders exist is because they are able to reduce the cost of capital on these mortgages/loans, making them more accessible to the general population.

In essence, a GSE like Farmer Mac improves access to credit. 

&#x200B;

3) **But wait, doesn't that mean GSE's take on toxic mortgage assets?**

In general, yes. 

But there's a catch. Both the primary lenders that AGM purchases the bulk of these agriculture loans/assets from (the **Farm Credit System**) as well as AGM itself are both regulated by the **Farm Credit Association.** 

The Farm Credit Association is an independent agency of the federal government which exists to regulate the financial institutions that provide credit to farmers.

In light of the Great Recession, the farm credit association has made tremendous leaps in ensuring only the most conservative underwriting measures to reduce the risk of default on these loans.

&#x200B;

**FINANCIALS**

&#x200B;

Now, here's the juicy part and why I think this is such a good investment. All this info is copy-pasted straight from their Q1 update:

* Provided $1.3 billion in liquidity and lending capacity in first quarter 2020, resulting in net outstanding business volume growth of $421.4 million; 
*  Net income attributable to common stockholders was $9.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share; 
* • Core earnings, a non-GAAP measure was $20.1 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share; 
* • Net interest income grew $0.7 million year-over-year to $41.3 million; 
* • Net effective spread, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14% from the prior-year period to $44.2 million; 
* **• 90-day delinquencies were 0.37% of total outstanding business volume as of March 31, 2020**
*  **First quarter provision for credit losses of $3.8 million, largely driven by expected COVID-19 impact.** 

Look at that provision for credit loss. It's only $3.8 million.That's **0.09%** of their outstanding business volume. That's nothing at all. This means they don't expect to face significant losses on their assets.

&#x200B;

**Dividend**

&#x200B;

* AGM has a near 5% dividend yield with a payout ratio of \~35%
* AGM recently raised the dividend from 0.70 per quarter to 0.80 per quarter

**LONG TERM OUTLOOK**

&#x200B;

* U.S. government won't allow farmers to suffer tremendous losses on their loans. Agriculture is a heavily subsidized industry and massive losses on agricultural mortgages and loans would be a huge detriment to the U.S.",2,1.0,1594651867.0

I’m 23 years old and been using this sub along with my own research to decide what options would be good for my 401k and Roth IRA. I want to see what people think of my options I’ve selected and see if there are better options/perspectives to consider. Here is a brief breakdown of my situation:
- Plan to hold super long term and ideally live off dividends to keep principal intact to pass onto future generations. Don’t just want to focus on pure yield yet since I have roughly 45 years before retiring and want to benefit from organic growth 

- Current 401k is mainly invested in funds offered by my company on fidelity however they have the brokerage link feature for me to invest in my own external choices and still get the company match

- Roth is mostly invested in 30 different funds and positions with roughly $300 invested in each fund. My goal is to consolidate to roughly 3-4 funds since I’ve noticed I have quite a bit of overlap and some funds have higher expense ratios that I can simply avoid through consolidation.

Here is my new formulated plan on where I should contribute:

401k-
VIG
FXAIX
DLN

Roth-
VOO

VIG

1. Is there an ETF or couple that can provide similar yield (after paying the ETF fees)? This will help with time as individual stock investing is taking too much time. And obviously is quite risky.

t3_htksfx,Feedback on my portfolio and suggestions for consolidation?,"Hi, all. 

I've been following this subreddit for the past few months and have enjoyed learning from you all. This is my first post and it's probably way too detailed, so my apologies for the length. But, I'd love to hear any feedback or suggestions on my portfolio, as well as any recommendations you would have for reducing the total number of different companies in which I'm currently invested. 

I currently have (40) different stocks and feel like perhaps that might be slightly too many, although I know there's no 'right' number of stocks to own. If you had the same portfolio and were going to consolidate your holdings down to perhaps 20-25 stocks or so, which of these would you keep and why? Or, if you prefer, which of these would you sell and why? 

Just a quick note about me. I'm 48 yrs old and apart from the 401k plan that I passively invest in through my company, I'm new to investing. I only bought my first few stocks back in early March during the first major market crash. I figured it would be a good time to get in and get some stocks at a very good price. 

Using Robinhood, I initially invested $100 and bought (6) different stocks on March 6, not really knowing much about stocks or the market in general. In fact, of those six initial stocks, I've only kept two of them (HA, INO). Since then, I've invested $3500 more and am currently up $498.74 (14.25%). Not too bad, but it can be better...

I recently began more of a focused effort to switch to dividend producing stocks. I sold many of the stocks I had initially bought that either weren't performing well or didn't generate a dividend. Below are each of the stocks I currently own, grouped together by dividend frequency. I included the number of shares in parentheses, as well as a brief note or explanation for most.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts, comments, opinions, suggestions, recommendations, or even criticisms.

&#x200B;

**Monthly Dividend**

$KBWD (4.036) - Bought this inexpensive ETF due to monthly dividend, but am considering selling it and replacing it with $JEPI instead. 

$PSEC (5.022) - Bought this because of consistent monthly dividend and solid recommendations.  

$STAG (2) - Bought this because of consistent monthly dividend and solid recommendations. 

&#x200B;

**Quarterly Dividend**

$ABBV (2) - Recently bought this Dividend Aristocrat because of excellent dividend history. 

$ADT (2.009) - Originally received as free stock due to referral on Robinhood, added another share because it was inexpensive and performing well, and has a small dividend. 

$AUY (4.009) - Bought this because of good dividend history and figured it would be good to have position in metals.  

$CARR (2) - Recently bought this Dividend Aristocrat because of excellent dividend history. 

$EURN (10.749) - Bought this because of good dividend history. However, currently in the hole in terms of stock performance. I plan to sell once it (hopefully) returns to break even point for me. 

$HA (2) - Bought this early on, more for sentimental reasons than anything, as I've visited four of the Hawaiian Islands over the years. But, it has a small dividend, so that's a bonus. With it being a smaller airline with significant footprint in Hawaii, I feel like it has a better chance than most other airlines to survive the COVID downturn.  

$HAL (2.008) - Bought this because of good dividend history. Good returns so far.

$JEF (4) - Bought this because of good dividend history. Good returns so far. 

$K (2) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history. 

$KDP (2) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history.

$KR (5) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history.

$LOW (4) - Bought this Dividend Aristocrat because of excellent dividend history and also becasue it's one of my personal favorite stores. 

$LUV (2) - Bought this because I feel like they are perhaps a little better positioned than some of the other airlines and will have a better chance of getting through the COVID related downturn. Also, this is my personal favorite airline to fly. 

$MSFT (3.005) - No-brainer investment in solid technology leader that I can actually afford. 

$NBLX (5) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history. 

$PBFX (2) - Recently bought this because of good dividend history.  

$PNC (1) - Recently bought this financial stock instead because of good dividend history. 

$SIRI (2) - Originally received as free stock due to referral on Robinhood, added another share because it was inexpensive and performing well and because it's part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. It also has a small dividend, which is a bonus. 

$VZ (6) - Bought this because of good dividend history. Debated between this and AT&T, but ultimately chose this because of slightly lower company debt and higher growth rate, even though dividend is less. 

$XOM (2.018) - Bought this Dividend Aristocrat because of excellent dividend history.

&#x200B;

**Semi-Annual Dividend**

$SFYX (2) - Bought this inexpensive ETF due to potential return of holdings. 

$SM (2) - Bought this because it was an inexpensive energy stock with a dividend.

&#x200B;

**Annual/Special Dividend**

$BAYRY (4) - Bought this because of its repuation as solid healthcare/pharma company with consistent dividend history. 

$FCAU (2) - Bought this very early on, before I knew what I was doing, just because I thought it would be good to own. I was thinking about selling it a few weeks ago, but was planning to hang onto it to see what happens as a result of merger and rebranding. 

&#x200B;

**No Dividend**

$BRK.B (1) - Bought this when it was lower, but it's honestly been a bit of a disappointment, cosidering Warren Buffet's repuatation. 

$DIS (2) - Bought these early on for average of $83.36 per share, so it's generated a nice return so far.  

$HTZ (2) - Took a flyer on these, unfortunatley just before the company announced the bankruptcy. Since I'm in the hole, I figured I would just hold them in the hopes that perhaps enough value comes back that I can at least break even.  

$INO (2) - Bought these for average of $10.78, so it's generated a nice return so far. 

$LVGO (2) - Bought these for average of $54.26, so it's generated a nice return so far. 

$NOG (30) - Initially bought 10 shares in early march for $0.78, but then added more in early June at a significantly higher rate, so I'm currently in the hole. I plan to sell once it (hopefully) returns to break even point for me. 

$OSS (10) - Took a flyer on some shares of this penny stock last week, as it generated a lot of interest and seemeed like it could take off. 

$PINS (2) - Bought this as it is one of the more affordable social media platforms. Hoping that eventually it takes off, so this is a long-term play.  

$PTON (1) - Bought this at $22.55, so it's generated a nice return so far.  

$SEAS (1) - Bought this very early on, before I knew what I was doing, only because I thought it would be fun/cool to own.

$SPCE (1) - Took a flyer on this, hoping that eventually it takes off, so this is a long-term play.  

$TMFC (2) - ETF that tracks top 100 or so stocks identified in The Motley Fool publications.  

$ZVO (1) - Just took a flyer on this 'penny stock' of an online education company, figuring the COVID lockdowns will likely only continue.

t3_htuk3c,"Working On A ""Perfect"" Portfolio","Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

So obviously no portfolio is ""perfect"" but I recently got into investing in January and have been playing around trying to design a ""perfect"" portfolio for myself. I want to focus on dividends for passive income but also have growth because I am young. 

&#x200B;

After 6 months of absorbing everything I could and learning what I could (again, I'm no expert so any and all input is greatly appreciated), I came up with this portfolio:

$PFE, $JNJ, $MDT

$KO, $PEP, $MCD, $DIS

$D, $PPL, $NEE

$RTX, $MMM, $HD

$MSFT, $V, $AVGO

$C, $TD, $JPM

$T, $VZ

$WMT, $WM, $CMCSA

&#x200B;

I ran this portfolio through [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/) to backtest it. I gave all holdings equal weight. I started with a $10k investment with a recurring 6k investment each year. Since $AVGO started in 2009, it only tracked since then and it beat SPY by $1,000 or so. I removed $AVGO and $V since they started around the same time and I wanted more years. Removing those two, it allowed a backtest to 1996 where it beat SPY by a whopping [168k](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

&#x200B;

I chose a $6000 per year recurring investment because that's a pretty standard $500 per month and the same amount I contribute to my Roth IRA each year.

&#x200B;

Next I threw the portfolio (minus $V and $AVGO) into this [program](https://trackyourdividends.com/) and equally weighted the shares of each stock to $100. The total yield of the portfolio came out to 3.32%. This would obviously fluctuate based on the weight of the holdings but with all assets being equal I thought this was pretty good (seeing as 4% is the goal from what I've seen).

&#x200B;

I think this is a great portfolio personally and will probably be the one I strive for little by little (only have about 7k in RH right now). I also like ETFs and will be allotting money for $VIG, $SPHD, $SPYD, and $JEPI. If $JEPI performs well for a while, I will split my funds from $SPHD and $SPYD equally into $JEPI and $VIG.

t3_huvnoc,Diversifying With Dividend Profile. Looking For Critiques!,"Hi all! 

First of all, thank you for your time and attention! I've been heavily investing the last year and have dabbled in common stocks with a growth strategy as well as day trading with options. As I'm trying to set up for my future, I've been researching and diving into Dividends more. 

My ultimate goal is to supplement my current growth portfolio with a dividend paying one for the future and be able to pass this along to my children as well. 

I am using M1 finance for my dividend portfolio since it takes out the guesswork and allows fractional shares. I would like some feedback and critique on my portfolio. I'm looking for high yield but also stability on these. I'm in my 30s so I currently have pretty high tolerance for risk. I think that's what got me interested in QYLD. 

This is weighted by % in my portfolio

* O - Reality Income Corp - 15%
* SPHD - S&P 500 High Dividend - 13%
* QYLD - NASDAQ Covered Calls ETF - 10%
* VZ - Verizon - 10%
* T - AT&T - 9%
* MMP - Magellan Midstream - 8%
* PRU - Prudential Financial - 7%
* BNS - Bank of Nova Scotia - 5%
* MMM - 3M - 5%
* XOM - Exxon Mobile
* BEP - Brookfield Renewable Partners - 2%
* VYM - Vanguard High Yield - target 5%

So before anyone starts typing JNJ or KO, I work in a regulatory agency where I'm not allowed to have holdings in those type of consumer goods and medical/pharm stuff. I believe that includes ETFs in those sectors too. 

Would love some strong critiques! My goal is to grow this portfolio to net a few hundred per month in order to replace my military reserve paycheck of $300-$400.

t3_hupjt3,"What is your opinion re: REITs, specifically office REITs?","So I invest in the Australian market (slowly educating myself about the American) and I can see that a lot of RE stocks have not bounced back the way that other stocks have. Now that makes some sense to me, due to the current threats/climate. However, this has left many REITs with attractive valuations and attractive dividends. 
Office REITs in particular seem to have the best valuations. Now I understand that due to working from home and other COVID related impacts, have brought in to questions the value of office space. Lots of companies have stated that they will continue the working from home trend, even after COVID ends due to the saved costs. 
However, I think this impact is overestimated. Lots of companies rely heavily on collaboration and collaboration that just works better face to face. Yes people can connect via zoom, teams etc but it’s just not the same. Also a few company managers have stated that they feels that the lower levels of control, communication and team mindset has a worse affect on productivity than the saved costs of working from home. 
So as I see it, there is a great chance a lot of companies will return to office space when this is all said and done. 
Assuming the REIT you look at is in great shape, great occupancy rates and quality tenants, they seem like a sound investment.
I’ve seen come with yields of 8-11%.

I’m really curious to put this out there and gain your opinion. 
Much appreciated and stay safe!",8,0.85,1595266250.0

I'm 24 years old and I wanted to start investing after fully paying off my student loans. I mainly hold canadian stocks in my TFSA investing account, and ETFs and American dividend stocks in my RRSP. I now have almost 10k invested in my TFSA. In that account, I tried to diversify my portfolio and decided on the following:

Financials: 20%

Utilities: 15%

Telecommunication: 15%

Energy: 10%

Technology: 10%

Consumer Defensive: 10%

REITs: 10%

Consumer Cyclical: 5%

Industrial: 5%

At the moment, this brings in about $318 a year in dividends. I started thinking of resetting my portfolio and set it up so I could buy 1 full share each payout, quarterly or monthly. I calculated it and I could do this with 5 canadian dividend stocks which would bring in $633 a year which would be reinvested. The 5 stocks would mainly be be in the financial, telecommunications, and real estate sector.

t3_hvao14,SPYD & VIG portfolio balancing thoughts.,"I've recently adjusted my Roth IRA in light of some research I've done regarding these two dividend ETFs. 

I dumped all my REIT specific ETFs in favor of SPYD because of SPYDs high real estate holdings (16.5% of holdings), and because of SPYDs 4-6% dividend history. 

This gives me decent exposure to high dividends from REIT holdings without taking as significant of a risk which, in the current climate, makes me feel more secure about real estate holdings. 

After doing some research on VIG I've noted that its holdings almost are opposite of SPYD in terms of what sectors are given priority. This, plus the prospectus being focused on holding companies that are expected to continually increase dividends makes VIG attractive as a diversification/risk balance along with SPYD.

Here's some quick holdings info:

||SPYD|VIG|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Real Estate|16.5%|0%|
|IT|3.9%|17.5%|
|Financials|15.5%|7.1%|
|Utilities|11.7%|4.9%|
|Healthcare|9%|16.6%|
|Energy|10.8%|0%|
|Industrials|0%|15.2%|

This isn't all of the holdings but as you can see, the majority of each ETF counters the other in terms of what sector they put more into. To me this means dividend focused holdings with more diversified risk. VIG doesn't have quite the yield that SPYD offers however in my personal opinon it more than makes up for it with the big names that aren't going anywhere such as Microsoft, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Visa, etc... all companies that aren't held by SPYD. 

My current ETF focuses in my roth in light of this research are: SPYD, VIG, VUG, VOO.

VUG seems a bit overstretched right now, and all of the Vanguard ETFs listed have overlapping holdings. That being said I'm somewhere in the realm of 1/3 SPYD, 1/3 VIG, and 1/3 VUG/VOO.

My dividend portfolio consists of 16 paying individual stocks, CEFs, ETFs, ETNs, BDCs and REITs.

Holdings: [https://imgur.com/a/caZW3ki](https://imgur.com/a/caZW3ki) 

The portfolio is in a taxable brokerage with the sole purpose of providing income in early retirement. I am mostly concerned with preservation of my money. I don't want any or very little ROC (Return of Capital) and I'm not chasing massive gains here, at least in this account. I have additional IRAs, SEP IRAs, Roth IRAs, HSAs and 401ks that I am going after the growth plays in.

I'm currently in my late 30s and have plans to retire by the time I am 48. A goal of mine was to build enough to pay the mortgage, and we did that and paid our mortgage off in March of 2019. So now, we are 100% debt free and all extra cash flow is being reinvested. My employer has a stock purchase plan and I get a 10% discount on the lowest price of the stock in the quarter, so I max out that benefit and after the holding period, I roll over the proceeds to this brokerage account and rinse and repeat. While I like our company, I don't want to have too much tied to the future of my employer.

The long term goal is to have no debt, own a house outright (these first two are both done) and generate at least 65k/yr or more in dividend yield from this account in order to FIRE. I don't use DRIP as everything now is commission free and I want to have a little more direction in what the income goes into and buy on down days. Currently the average monthly income is $1,590.13 in this account.

This account is used solely as a bridge from the time I decide to FIRE and when I can start drawing on my 401ks, IRAs, SEP IRAs, etc. which I have maxed out throughout my working years. Sure, it's a tax drag, but if you want to retire early, you need to be able to cover that bridge and not just pump into your retirement plans. In addition to the holdings below, I also have \~100k across long term growth buys that do not pay dividends in this account. They include $BKNG, $OKTA, $LYV, $LOVE. The plan is to hold them for an unknown amount of time, when I'm happy with the profit, convert them into more dividend payers. I'm getting very close to selling $LOVE as I bought in around $7 and have a nice gain thus far.

I recently added two new dividend paying positions ($JEPI, and $REML) as well, but those are not in my list for two reasons. $JEPI is too new to calculate a long term yield estimate using the TD Ameritrade ""Income Estimator"" tool and I see $REML as a 100% gamble. The dividend yield for $REML is stupid high, currently TD Ameritrade estimates a 77% payout as a mortgage REIT. It was over 100% at one point recently, obviously that is not sustainable and that Income Estimator tool uses that number to calculate future yield. It crashed massively due to COVID back in March and if it recovers will be a slow recovery. I'm not sold on that fact that it will ever recover to that same level. Maybe. Maybe not. It's highly volatile and leveraged. If you can't stomach a loss, DO NOT get into it. If everyone is able to make their mortgage payments throughout this pandemic, there's a ton of upside, if we crash even further, it's likely $REML will be worth $0. I'm ok with this risk. The fat monthly payout and even fatter quarterly payout is nice. Again, total gamble.

The list of stocks below gets me an average yield of 7.29%. The cost basis is $261,616.39 and yields me $19,081.57 without the two listed stocks that I took out of it. See the image I attached for how mush weight I have across them. I'm definitely over 20k per year with those other two above added in. For now, I just keep growing my positions to get me closer to that 65k/yr!

Have a good weekend everyone.

t3_hwvpug,Reflecting on my own personal portfolio for Q2 2020 (Portfolio Review?),"For the past several years in my dividend investment journey, every three months I take a day off and dedicate the entire day to my portfolio.  My wife calls it my ""Excel Day,"" since all she really sees me doing is modifying my Excel spreadsheet.

Today was that day for Q2 of 2020 (April 2020 through June 2020).  Normally I would just keep this information to my wife and I, but since people seem to really like me reviewing other people's portfolios, I figured it would be kinda interesting to see other people's thoughts on how I view my own portfolio.  

The other reason I am posting this is because whenever I do a portfolio review, I always link to my own personal portfolio.  According to my brokerage M1, multiple people have clicked the link to ""invest in this pie,"" and have put real money into mirroring my personal portfolio.   I feel like I owe it to those individuals to inform them of how I am modifying my portfolio based upon the past three months of what I have seen in the markets.  Let them know what I am selling, buying more of, etc.  With that being, said, I guess this is the part where I review my own portfolio.  

&#x200B;

I won't bore you with where I went to research and how I went about researching the activities of the various companies in my portfolio.  I already tend to keep a close eye on most of them, so it was just a matter of checking in on the companies that do not tend to make headlines every day.  I then open up Seeking Alpha and look at the numbers of the companies I am invested in and simply focus on absorbing data, taking a few notes when appropriate.  Once my research is complete, I eat lunch to clear my head.  I then head back to my desk and make some decisions.

The first decision is what companies (if any) should I sell out of.  Going into today, I already had companies on the metaphorical chopping block.  Those were: $MMM, $MAIN, $FTAI, $LLY, and $CVS.  It is important to note here why a company can be put on my portfolio's chopping block.  I am always comparing the companies in my portfolio to each other.  Me selling out of a company does not necessarily mean the company is bad, rather that the company may not be completely aligned with my goals as an investor, or that the company is making a series of moves that I personally am opposed to.  I will never sell on a whim.  A company must remain on the chopping block for at least an entire quarter before I allow myself to sell out completely.  This is to prevent me from making impulse decisions.

After looking at the research, I determined that I would sell out of $MMM, $LLY, and $CVS.  Let me explain my reasoning below:

**$MMM**. Looking at this company over the past five years, all I really see is stagnation.  While the dividend is still increasing year over year faster than inflation, virtually every other metric used to analyze a company has remained stagnant.  Net Income for 2019 was actually lower than in 2015.  Stagnant revenue and profits coupled with an increasing dividend equals an increasing payout ratio.  3M is no exception to this rule, seeing a payout ratio rise from 52.99% in 2015 to 72.56% in 2019.  If this continues at this rate, the payout ratio could easily rise to over 90% or even over 100% by 2029.  Considering I am of the ""buy and hold forever"" mindset, this would not be good and could potentially result in a dividend cut several years into the future.  Combine all this with a stagnant share price, and I see 3M serving more as a future drag on my portfolio heading into the 2020s and beyond.

**$LLY.** I will begin by saying I am not an expert in the healthcare space.  I sold out of this company because I have a philosophy that no matter how good a stock looks, I will only invest in what I can understand.  I cannot analyze that which I do not understand.  When I bought this company, I believed I would try to work more on learning how the healthcare industry works so I could perform more detailed analyses on healthcare companies, but unfortunately I am just as stuck as I was before.  My wife works for the government as a translator, so we use her health insurance.  She understands the American healthcare nightmare more than I do, so she handles that aspect of our lives.  This company may be the most undervalued company on Earth, but I simply cannot own something I know nothing about.  Technically, I could project this onto every company in my healthcare pie, but I recognize that I need exposure to the space to have a diversified portfolio, so I always try to tread very carefully when messing with the companies in my healthcare pie.  

**$CVS.** I used to recommend this company to people interested in healthcare stocks, but its performance over the past five years has changed my mind.  The stock has been trending nothing but downwards after peaking in late July 2015, with the dividend stagnation only adding to the downward trend.  Compared to my other healthcare stocks, this one is just not keeping up, so I have cut it out.  

&#x200B;

Now to explain why I did not sell out of the other companies on the chopping block from last quarter.

**$MAIN.** This company is about nothing except the dividend to me.  Today the company announced that it was profitable for the second quarter of 2020, which is becoming rarer and rarer in 2020, so good on them for that.  The monthly dividends are a huge draw, and as long as management keeps paying them, I am here for them.  However, if the payout ratio stays too high, I will likely sell, as I prefer sustainable dividends over the long term.

**$FTAI.** This is a company that I bought years ago at such a low price that I can't bring myself to sell.  Including dividends, my ROI on this company is sitting at around 511.32% over the past few years.  I hate the stagnant dividend, but every time I think about selling, I just cannot bring myself to do it. It's been losing money for years, but just started turning a profit in 2019.  If anyone can give me one or more good reasons to finally ditch this company, I am all ears.  Especially interested in what I should replace it with.  I want the dividends in my portfolio to grow over time and compound.  A stagnant fixed dividend runs counter to that goal.

&#x200B;

Looking over the data for Q2, I have added the following companies to my metaphorical chopping block:

**$EL.** The shutdowns have really hurt this company.  Even though I tell my wife every day that she is beautiful and does not need makeup, she still uses this company's products on a daily basis.  I bought this company purely because she uses their products, and I wanted to make sure we were profiting off her desire to wear makeup and the other female beauty products that currently sit on my bathroom counter and I have no idea what they are (What is a setting spray?  Should I even care?)  According to my wife, this company owns many valuable brands and is a solid investment in female beauty.  She talked to me about this company for about thirty minutes regarding the different products, and I did not understand any of it.  I got that they made nail polish.  I know what that is because I have a sister who was once a teenager, but other than that I am flying blind here.  If there are any individuals in this subreddit with knowledge of the beauty community, perhaps I can get their opinions on if this stock is worth it for the long term.

So going into Q3 of 2020, I think my portfolio is looking very strong.  For those who are interested, [here is the link to my portfolio as it stands now](https://m1.finance/5pfRVMQqi84h), adjusted for what I have mentioned above.  Every company in my portfolio is likely to pay their Q3 dividend on time.  The only suspensions I have in this portfolio are $EL and $DIS.  I have already seen Kroger, Brookfield Renewable Partners, and Canadian National Railway announce dividend increases for this quarter's payments.  

As for the company I am most bullish on for Q3 2020, it would have to be Cracker Barrel.  As a manager for the company, I have an insider perspective, and that perspective is telling me that this company could have turned a profit during Q2, but chose not to (based on my back of the envelope calculations).  During the closures, we were limited to only Togo service.  It would have been very easy to just sit idly by and wait out the closures and preserve cash.  Just let all the hourly employees go and keep a skeleton crew.  However, management chose a different strategy.  When the world shut down, Cracker Barrel's executives got together in a closed door meeting and decided on the following things:

1. Provide retention pay to **all** hourly employees so they can survive the quarantine. The amount of retention pay was determined based upon how long the employee had been with the company.
2. All employees were given the ability to buy food from the restaurant at the price Cracker Barrel paid for it.  By doing this, employees got to fill up the their refrigerators without having to go to a grocery store and potentially get infected and they got good food dirt cheap.
3. All employees who had been with the company long enough got 1 free meal per day through the shutdowns.  That way those employees could conserve cash more easily by cutting their food budget by \~33%.  
4. The company made sure nobody lost healthcare by essentially paying for everyone's premiums through the shutdowns.
5. Normally employees get a 35% discount on everything.  However, to help employees conserve money, the discount was raised to 50% for the duration of the shutdowns.  Considering we do sell quite a bit of food in retail, this was well received by employees.  
6. All executives were required to take a minimum 50% pay reduction for 2020.  Some executives chose a near 100% pay reduction to help the company preserve cash.  
7. The company gave 2 Regional Vice Presidents and 22 District Managers the ""option"" of early retirement.  Severance and all that jazz.  The head of Restaurant and Retail Operations then got together and redrew all the district and regional boundaries to slim down the corporate structure.  This will save the company a lot of money in the next several years by trimming down the bureaucracy.
8. There were a few other things the company did that I do not know if I am allowed to mention, so I will not mention them because I do not want to have that conversation with my superiors.

The question outsiders may have is ""Why would a restaurant company do this?""  The answer is pretty simple actually.  Loyalty.  The restaurant business is infamous for extremely high turnover, but the loyalty of Cracker Barrel is legendary in the industry.  You have employees in every job code who have been with the company for years or even decades.  I know servers, grill cooks, dishwashers, retail associates, and maintenance workers who have worked for this company for decades.  I myself have worked for the company since I was 17, and plan to work here until I retire.  The company is very good to its employees, mainly because the company has a culture of internal promotion.  With the exception of the CEO and Chief Legal Officer, the executives who decided how this company was going to handle the pandemic were themselves internally promoted through the corporate hierarchy to reach their current positions.  This is likely why no Cracker Barrel has actually ever tried to unionize.  Those who are running this operation know what it is like to work for the company.  These are the benefits of refusing to franchise.  You keep your best and brightest inside the company, and move them up the ladder as they improve.  Combine the above with a loyal customer base, and you have a borderline recession-proof company. 

I could honestly dedicate an entire thread to why I feel the company is undervalued, but I do not want to cross the line between education and flattery.  When you look at things objectively, the stock is undervalued by quite a lot.  It is almost completely due to the meddling of Biglari Capital Corp and its CEO Sadar Biglari.  For the past nine years Biglari has tried to insert himself onto the company's board.  He has essentially run his company into near bankruptcy trying to wage war on management.  It is actually really sad honestly.  [This letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000092189513001908/ex991to13da2507428021_091713.htm) filed with the SEC was passed around the company back when it was first released.  It reads like an angry manchild wrote it.  

Alas, Biglari has driven his company nearly to the point of bankruptcy trying to fight Cracker Barrel.  Once Biglari is out of the picture, the stock will begin rising once again.",66,0.98,1595567109.0

t3_hxwbt8,Reconstructing my portfolio,"Hey all,

I know people in this sub like to go for individual stocks instead of ETF’s because of the no expense ratio and being able to manage each stock directly. I’ve heard people pick stocks they like out of good etf’s which is what i would like to do.

My plan is:
Find 5 good dividend oriented stocks
Find 5 good growth stocks
Pick the most reoccurring/ones i like out of them
make sure i have around 2 different stocks per sector for diversification 

Does this sound like a logical plan? I don’t need double digit returns. I like consistent, stable growth with some dividends in there because at the end of the day, the money you save should be more than the money that your portfolio generates, your portfolio just supplements your income passively.

Right now I have 2500$ in it and want to grow it to 10k$.

t3_hxp0pa,Over-Diversification and Dividends,"A sentiment I've heard a few times on this sub and others is that over-diversification can be bad. To my understanding, this is because investing in too many stocks/ETFs/mutual funds limits your potential to beat the market and makes your portfolio harder to manage. 

This makes sense to me when talking about stock price growth, but does this also apply to dividend growth? Dividends are much more explicit, as you can all but guarantee a steadily increasing dividend from many stocks. Furthermore, the point of dividend investing seems to be seeking a solid near-guaranteed return, which to me seems to imply that you can never have too much diversification. 

Would love some thoughts or articles on this topic. Also here is my current portfolio (23 y/o), I'm just starting out so any advice is welcome!

They have 1.1million shares outstanding, and I’ve had a hard time on trying to find the IPO price for when it started trading. So, I used Robinhood  and the chart shows that the price starts at $50.03, so if that was the IPO price. Assuming that they used the IPO to fund $JEPI then they got a little over $55million. To my understanding they give daily numbers, so on 7/24/2020 their fund asset was at $57.98million. They also have an expense ratio of .35, not quite sure if that’s too high or not. 

Like do you guys see this as a way for JPMorgan to just make more money quickly or if this fund would actually be taken seriously and tried to be grown?

I’d like to construct my portfolio to be somewhat low focus required so I can just contribute money as often as I can and watch it grow over time.

t3_i0okd7,Residential REIT ETF: REZ vs NURE vs individual apartment REITs,"Really like the discount of residential apartment RE right now. Industry analysts estimate 20% discount to NAV.

2 largest residential ETFs own a mix of self storage, apartments, single family homes, healthcare and tower stocks. Not the ideal mix as I don't like healthcare REITS and feel like 5g REITs are too expensive. 

Looking at REZ vs NURE. REZ seems better, better sponsor, more liquid, longer track record, and it feels like this is a good long term holding in a dividend growth portfolio. Currently own ELS and a lot of VNQ, but like a few individual apartment REITS like AIV.

t3_i0l89f,Selecting An ETF / REIT Based Off of Age,"Question: 

If you are in your early 20’s, would it be more beneficial to hold high yielding ETFs / REITs such as SPHD, VYM, SPYD, O etc. in a non tax leveraged account, and hold growth ETFs such as VIG, VTI, VXUS, VOO, etc. in a 401k/IRA? 

At the moment, I’m stuck between buying a couple thousand dollars of SPHD, VYM, or O. 

I used a DRIP calculator and calculated between the years 2015-2019 (Pre-Corona to get somewhat clearer results) and found that SPHD and VYM are similar. The higher dividend yield from SPHD made up for the minimal growth rate in the price of the ETF, while VYM’s price growth allowed it to keep up, and in some cases, be slightly ahead of SPHD.  

I also calculated for 2015-2020 post-March to see what unstable conditions would do, and here, VYM out performed SPHD by a couple thousand. But, I’m being optimistic and hoping that for the next 5 years, nothing like this happens again. 

I also ran the DRIP calculator on O (Realty Income Corp) Vs. SPHD and VYM and I don’t know what to really think of the results. O’s graph was quite messy compared to the ETFs, but that’s expected considering it’s that O is one sector rather than a diversified ETF. Yet, even post March, it is outperforming both SPHD and VYM. The only thing outperforming all of these was VIG, by one or two thousand dollars by the end of years 2019/2020. 

So, between VYM, SPHD, and O, I’m thinking of picking a combination of SPHD and O to grow my position over the next few years. I’m a huge fan of the monthly dividend idea and O looks to be a very solid REIT for me. I would just like to know, would VIG be a better choice at my age to hold in Robinhood, or should I put it into a Roth IRA with VTI, VXUS, etc.. the lower yielding, higher growth ETFs, and just hold the higher yielding moderate growth ETFs/REITs in my Robinhood?",2,1.0,1596112348.0

It's not the flashiest way of making money, but it's effective. **Be patient, be consistent, and eventually you'll have something that will reward you 1000x more.**

Frankly, I didn't really look at dividends when I first started investing. I always saw yields as a bad thing (why would companies pay back instead of using that money to improve infrastructure?). I was especially wary of higher yields. 

I invested in companies that I saw a lot of potential in (e.g., AMD, NVDA, and MSFT) and traded options. After Roth contributions and making slow (but steady) progress towards chipping away my student loans, I started taking 50% of my job and options profits into nurturing and caring for my tree.

I received my first dividends a while back and I've been hooked ever since. Excited to continue!

They don't know if they should go for higher yield or growth. Would the best option be to go growth and transition to dividends when they're ready to retire? I recommended a standard VTI VXUS with some bonds if they wanted to and then when they're ready to retire they can sell off some for dividend stocks. Their plan is to live off dividends and not touch the principal. Or would going with higher yield from now until retirement make more sense? They don't want to do the 4% sell off rule each year. Would be mostly if not all dividend focused ETFs or something like VTI for th most part at the start. Then either keeping those dividend focused ETFs or selling them at retirement to buy. It seems like mostly VTI for 7 years and then sell off to buy dividend ETFs and maybe some stocks is the way to go but wanted to check here,7,0.9,1597392532.0

I wanted to pose a question to the group. I am a younger investor with a long time horizon (30+ years).

I’ve been investing for a little while now, but mostly heavy in tech and index funds.

My specific question: What are the benefits of investing in dividend stocks rather than dumping your money into SPY, or QQQ (SPY & NASDAQ index fund equivalent)? Both of these indexes are quite diversified across all the companies they are comprised of. Granted, they are both focused on tech but will automatically weed out any poor companies over time.

When I compare the historical returns of SPY against T, SPHD, O, or even VYM for example, they aren’t even close. SPY has outperformed both of these stocks significantly.

I am not hating on dividends... I’m trying to educate myself as an investor to understand why they are so popular, and if I should invest in them myself.

t3_idrgu2,Considering a few high-yield dividend stocks,"BNS yield: 6.26%
UNM yield: 6.33%
T yield: 7.01%
WYND: 7.24%
BTI : 8.02%

I think that they're all rather battered thanks to COVID-19, and will eventually return to their pre-COVID-19 highs.

T and UNM have consistently raised their dividend and have, in my opinion, acceptable payout ratios and the potential to raise their dividends for many years. I am unconcerned about T's debt; their loss in subscribers and their seeming mismanagement of their entertainment divisions are both a little concerning.

UNM is a bit of a dark horse. I was looking at the S&P 500's Financials constituents and discovered them. Insurance? Sure. I think I can load up on the cheap and that the gamble will pay off later.

WYND is kind of a wild card. They cut their dividend recently. I'm thinking that they might be a shorter-term play, unless they can commit to their dividend again. Before the COVID-19 slump they were near their all-time highs, and I think they'll return eventually and also maintain a decent annual dividend until then. I have faith that their core business will improve in the long-term.

BTI and BNS, well, those have international appeal. They have, I dunno, variable but appealing annual payouts?

t3_ifq5ak,I’m bullish on $NAT and their ex-div is this Thursday 8/27/20,"Hi r/dividends, I wanted to talk about $NAT - which is a tanker company - that is going to pay $0.2 per share on 9/4/20.  Their ex-dividend date is this Thursday, 8/27.


 - $NAT published Q2 and first half 2020 results, and has shown outstanding growth to net income, EBITDA and net revenue.

 - The supply and demand shocks that occurred in May created a super contango, which caused freight rates to soar as floating storage interest spiked.

 - Uncertainties for 2020 and 2021 still remain, and could show oil recovery to come in below estimates if travel fails to recover as expected with second waves possible.

 - TCE (Time Charter Equivalent) growth is substantial and six times the operating expenses per day, giving $NAT a lot of room to still capitalize even if TCE falls.

 - There is higher-than-average short interest since May, put/call ratio is currently 0.2, yet shares have hardly moved in the past several months.


Tl;dr: Nordic does present an opportunity, albeit with high risk, but with a measure of relative safety due to its current $.20 dividend, offering a forward yield of 17.7%; however, long-term prospects do look quite muted, a triple-digit upside looks very out-of-the-picture.

What is your opinion on NWN? 

It's a natural gas and water company (green energy is always good). 

It's current price is \`53\`+- (Lost 32% in the past 6 Months).

It has a Nice Div data (P/E is a bit high for me, but i guess it is because of the income lost).

t3_ifj33q,An open letter to the moderation team regarding this subreddit.,"Dear u/Brintoul and u/AlwaysHavingFun2020,

Hi. Hope you had a nice weekend and are staying safe during this interesting time. I am writing this letter today out of love for this little community carved out in this corner of the internet. 

I'll cut right to the chase. I'm sure you have noticed recently the change taking place in the postings. More and more we are seeing the same posts over and over again, and I think it is high time this subreddit carves out its own unique rules for posting and commenting. No longer do I believe the site wide rules of Reddit are good enough for this community. We have become too large and specialized. As a result, I am officially proposing on behalf of myself a codification of a series of rules, to which I will be detailing below. You may take them or leave them, modify them as you wish, but let the records of the internet show who suggested them.

Posting rules: 

1. **No self promotion:** Direct links to user-generated YouTube Videos, Blog posts, advertisements, etc. all fall under this category.

2. **All advice must be given in good faith:** This is a community dedicated to the sharing of genuine advice. As we want to help people prepare for their entire financial future, advice shown to be given in bad faith will be removed with no warning. Repeated violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban.

3. **No posts encouraging insider trading, violations of SEC/ESMA guidelines, or other unlawful activity.**

4. **If you want to post an image of your portfolio, the image must come from a certified brokerage:** If you do not feel comfortable displaying the exact value of your holdings, feel free to blur them out.

5. **Do not critique another user for having a lower share count than you in a particular stock:**  Especially in this economy, people are trying to set aside whatever they can. Don't judge how much other people have in their bank account. You don't know what they are experiencing.

6. **No referral links:**  Links generated when sharing one's portfolio through brokerages like M1 are exempt. 

**Insider Trading Policy:**  If you are a [Section 16 Officer](https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/officersanddirectors) in any US company, to prevent any conflict of interest, we ask that you please disclose this information when you post, regardless of whether you are talking directly about the company in question. Unique user flairs identifying yourself as a ""Section 16 Officer: $[Ticker Symbol]"" may be handed out at moderator discretion. Posing as a Section 16 Officer, or failing to identify oneself as such in postings may result in actions up to and including a ban. 

The above rules I officially submit to you moderators. I nominate them to be the bedrock of our new rules. Any users of this subreddit wishing to second the nomination of these rules, please feel free to let your voice be heard in the comments. Please also let me know how I can change the wording to sound better. I just whipped up these rules at 1:30am based upon my immediate recollection of what I have personally seen happen on this sub (minus the Insider Trading Policy, I just think we need that because we deal in stocks.)  

Will this require more active moderation? Probably. Am I willing to put my money where my mouth is and help moderate?  Yes. Am I just trying to become a mod? No.  I just want this community to succeed.

In closing, I and the rest of the community hope to hear from you soon. Stay safe everyone.

Sincerely,

Firstclass30

t3_igmrr5,The single greatest investment book,"I'm currently reading the single greatest investment book by Lowell Miller and it is big on dividend growth investing.

t3_igh084,An open letter (and welcome) to the community of r/Dividends.,"To the members of r/dividends

Yesterday I posed an open letter to the moderation team of this subreddit (a letter which can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ifj33q/an_open_letter_to_the_moderation_team_regarding/)) regarding the state of this community.  In that letter, I said I was willing to put my money where my mouth is and help moderate.  I am pleased to announce that u/Brintoul has taken me up on my offer.  I am now officially a member of the moderation team.

I have read through every single comment left on my original letter, and will be working tirelessly to put into practice what was proposed and suggested by both myself, and those who took the time to comment.  As we the mods make these changes, I plan to keep this community informed every step of the way about what we are doing, so that nothing should come as a surprise out of nowhere.  Not every change will be easily noticed (as there will be significant changes on the back end), but don't worry, you will not be kept in the dark.  Below, I will go ahead and list what the agenda looks like right now:

**What we have already done:**

\- Unpinned the Dividend cut list and the stock vote threads, as these had not been maintained for months.

**What is being done right now as you read this:**

\- Official community rules are being drafted as you read this, and will likely show up in the sidebar by the end of the day.  (See below for the working draft of the rules, and feel free to leave a comment on your thoughts about them)  These rules will not be applied retroactively, so don't worry about that. That being said... 

\- Bans **will** be applied retroactively to users who violated Reddit's site-wide rules regarding harassment, threats, etc.  Those rules existed before today, and you already knew them.  They are not and never have been acceptable in any subreddit, especially one like this dedicated to genuine advice.

\- We are taking suggestions from the community about anything and everything in the comments.  I will be reading every single one.  Anything and everything.  From proposed ideas like a dedicated meme day, to logo ideas, whatever you want us to consider.  Upvote what you agree with, you know the drill.

**Planned actions to be taken over the next seven days:**

\- AutoModerator will be brought on board to assist with the more mundane and menial tasks of running the subreddit, so expect to see him in the next few days as we set his parameters for this subreddit.

\- An overhaul to the look of the subreddit, and hopefully a custom theme (leave suggestions in the comments) so we don't look like a dead community.

\- The integration of community feedback into how this subreddit will be run.

\- The creation of a wiki containing an in-depth explanation of the rules, punishments for breaking them.

\- A dedicated tab for FAQs about investing.

**Second draft of the rules:**

 Note: These rules are not yet in effect.  If you disagree with any of them, speak now or forever hold your peace.  I took your suggestions regarding Rule 4 and have updated it to be more clear.

Posting rules:

1. **No self promotion:** Direct links to user-generated YouTube Videos, Blog posts, advertisements, etc. all fall under this category.
2. **All advice must be given in good faith:** This is a community dedicated to the sharing of genuine advice. As we want to help people prepare for their entire financial future, advice shown to be given in bad faith will be removed with no warning. Repeated violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban.
3. **No posts encouraging insider trading, violations of SEC/ESMA guidelines, or other unlawful activity.**
4. **No solicitations for due diligence:** Do not create a thread with the specific intention of getting other users to research a company or companies for you.  If you want to start a genuine discussion about a particular company or companies, let us know your thoughts.
5. **Do not critique another user for having a lower share count than you in a particular stock:** Especially in this economy, people are trying to set aside whatever they can. Don't judge how much other people have in their bank account. You don't know what they are experiencing.
6. **No referral links:** Links generated when sharing one's portfolio through brokerages like M1 are exempt.

**Insider Trading Policy:** If you are a [Section 16 Officer](https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/officersanddirectors) in any US company, to prevent any conflict of interest, we ask that you please disclose this information when you post, regardless of whether you are talking directly about the company in question. Unique user flairs identifying yourself as a ""Section 16 Officer: $\[Ticker Symbol\]"" may be handed out at moderator discretion. Posing as a Section 16 Officer, or failing to identify oneself as such in postings may result in actions up to and including a ban. 

**AMA Policy:** While you do not need to get permission to host an AMA, we do ask you notify the moderator team at least 24 hours ahead of time. We reserve the right to shut down an AMA if you are found to be acting in bad faith.

&#x200B;

In closing, I would like to thank this community for the opportunity to work with you all to make this a truly global community of dividend investors.

Hope to see you around,

t3_ih7sjc,A comprehensive explanation of every change I have made over the past 24 hours (and what you can do to help) + some FAQ answers,"Good afternoon r/dividends,

It has been a little over 24 hours since I have become a mod, and a lot has changed in the ongoing effort to revamp this community.  Below, I will list every change that I have made, and provide details where necessary. Major changes are **in bold**.  Minor changes are *italicized.*

&#x200B;

1. **Officially codified subreddit specific rules**: You can check them on the sidebar.  They went into effect at 00:00 on 26 August, and will not be applied retroactively, as this sub has an 11 year history and nobody has time for that.  If anyone is curious, it took 35 minutes for someone to violate Rule 1.  Make sure to check the insider trading policy and AMA policy.
2. **Retroactively enforced Reddit's site-wide rules, clearing out the six year backlog of user reported violations**: Bans were administered to individuals who were repeatedly violating Reddit site-wide rules against threats, harassment, etc.
3. **The spam filter strength for the subreddit has been changed to ""high.""** This is the default setting.  I have no idea why it was changed to low.  Reddit has an automated system that can catch about 80% of spam on its own.  Normally it works pretty well, but I will keep an eye on it and am able to overrule it if the bot makes a mistake.
4. **Introduced a minimum and maximum post title limit of 10 characters and 240 characters respectively**: This is designed to further aid in the abolition of spam in this subreddit. I noticed most of the spam appeared to violate these parameters, so this is designed to make my life easier and hopefully not inconvenience anyone. (Note: this applies to post titles only, not the contents of submissions). 
5. **Implemented a repost frequency to cut down on spam:** In layman's speak, the same URL cannot be posted over and over again.  Reddit will prohibit the post from being published.  The current time limit is two weeks.  
6. **Automoderator is now activated:** I had to teach myself how to imput the functions to make it do what I wanted, but now it seems to be working.  I'm not going to tell you what it is looking for, because then you would find a way to evade its detection.  Just don't worry about him.
7. *Suggested sort changed from ""none"" to ""best.""*
8. *Changed the community name.*
9. *Added community topics to feed the Reddit algorithm.*
10. *Changed community description.*
11. *Added Welcome message that will be sent to all new users when they join the community.*
12. *Changed the upvote and downvote colors to the official shades of green and red used by the NYSE because why not.*
13. *Created a poll on the look of the subreddit.  Go vote* [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/igrw6o/poll_on_the_look_of_the_subreddit_open_until_sept/).  You guys requested it.
14. *Created post flairs.*
15. *Created user flairs.*  More will be added as time progresses. ***Note:*** To those of you who have left feedback and suggested changes that I adopted, you will find a custom user flair in your settings as my way of saying thank you for helping contribute to this subreddit.  I am a firm believer in giving credit where it is due, so you guys can take credit for changing this subreddit.  These custom userboxes are green.  You are free to use them, or not use them.  It doesn't matter to me.
16. Reformatted the sidebar.
17. **Added custom community awards**:  These awards were quietly rolled out a few hours ago, and already some have begun to use them.  They are completely optional (and impossible to profit from).  They can be found in the ""community"" tab when you wish to award a post.  I added them because I figured there were those out there who want the ability to recognize the valuable contributions of others.  The Reddit coins the subreddit receives will be gifted out to users who make meaningful posts.  

&#x200B;

That is about it for all the changes made so far.  Now to answer your most frequently asked questions sent through modmail and my DMs.

**Q. Will posts have to be approved beforehand by the moderators?** 

*A. No.  There is no whitelisting system in place and there are currently no plans to whitelist submissions.*

**Q. How will bans work?  Are you going to abuse permabans like other subreddits?**

*A. Ideally, the only permanent bans will be given to bots.  When a user violates the subreddit rules, their post will be removed with an explanation given.  Continued intentional violations will result in a 72 hour ban.  If the violation persists, the ban will be extended to 7, 30, then 365 days.  Only beyond that point will a permanent ban be considered.  When violating Reddit's sitewide rules, 30 day bans will be the default after the warning stage.  Bots will be permanently banned with no warnings.*

**Q. Will post flair be required going forward?**

*A. At the moment, no.  When I created the custom flairs, Reddit turned on mandatory post flair for some reason.  I've turned it back off, but I may turn it on again based on the community feedback.*

**Q. Is meta discussion allowed?**

*A. Yes.  Meta discussion is encouraged.  I want to make this subreddit better, so any and all feedback is appreciated.*

**Q. Can you ban (insert username) for violating the rules?**

*A. If you believe someone has violated the rules of this subreddit, please report them and they will be dealt with accordingly.  The moderators toolbox allows me to see every user reported violation.  I have no way to view every single comment and post though.  So if you see something, report it.  I have no way to view who reports a post, so you can be assured your reports are anonymous.*

**Q. Anything I can do to help?**

*A. Participate.  This subreddit is driven by its users.  Post, comment, award, upvote, downvote, report.  Recommend this subreddit to your friends.  Create the kind of discussion you want to see.  I'll focus on keeping the spam and junk away if you guys focus on enjoying your time here.*

t3_igyp71,"I made free tools to track unusual stock movements, options, and insider trading.","Three months ago, I made a bot ([https://twitter.com/unusual\_whales](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales)) to help with tracking, alerting, and getting a historical understanding of options!

I was annoyed by the lack of tooling for us regular traders, and got to work in building as many free, or damn near affordable tools I could find. I built free scanners (my stock tool caught CLNY's gain, CETV's run, and more!), long term options history for anyone to learn from or get free history and a popular free Twitter account for people to see unusual plays. I even created mobile apps that are getting more and more free features every week!

So far, my tools have caught a myriad different and interesting trades, from KNDI’s surge to the 2000% TSLA 5:1 ([https://twitter.com/unusual\_whales/status/1293299420654522368](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1293299420654522368)), 3500% TEVA play, and Kanye West/GAP before it happened! You can check my results at any time!

And to toot my own horn, yesterday I caught MRNA and CRM insider trading ([https://twitter.com/unusual\_whales/status/1298264128738353160](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1298264128738353160)) netting over 1000% changes!

Although I don't exclusively focus on dividends stocks, I do a bunch of calls on companies post dividend date, etc.

Anyway, I would love your ideas for feedback and free features you'd guys want to see better dividend companies as they grow/trade/have insider movement!

t3_igrw6o,Poll on the look of the subreddit (open until Sept 1),"One of the most requested features is a change in the appearance of the subreddit.  Below is a poll on what the community color should be (for those not aware of reddit terminology, it will replace the blue).

The order of the options will be randomized to avoid any bias.  Unfortunately, I cannot color the options, hex codes are the best I can do.

Don't ask my personal preference, as I will remain neutral out of respect for the voting process (I wont vote either).  I will take my preference to the grave (maybe).

Regrettably, Reddit does not allow for any poll to be held in any other format besides first past the post.  Because of this, we will conduct this vote like a French election.  If one color gets an absolute majority (50% +1), that option will win by default.  If no option received a majority, a second poll containing the top two results will be created and left open for 24 hours.  I would like as much of a community consensus as possible on this.

As for the logo, I am open to suggestions on its appearance.  Feel free to make your thoughts known on the logo.  Should it be changed from the default?  If so, to what?

t3_igpkwy,Public Service Announcement: The new rules are now live!,"This is a public service announcement that as of 26 August 2020, 00:00 GMT, the new subreddit rules are in full effect.  Community feedback over two iterations has shaped their final form.  Please take a moment to read them before posting and commenting.  Violations will be dealt with accordingly.

Please note: These rules will not be enforced retroactively, however any and all posts and comments made after the above time will be subject to the new rules.

&#x200B;

**Other minor changes:**

1. A minimum post length of 15 characters and a maximum post length of 240 characters is now in effect.  This change was made because Reddit has an automatic spam filter mechanism.  I never realized until now just how much spam is stopped by the site itself.  These character length guidelines will save a lot of time for me on the backend (manually confirming all this junk is spam), and are designed to provide minimal interference to you.
2. I have enabled the repost frequency filter.  This will prevent users from uploading the same outside link multiple times in a row.  This should cut down on much of the spam, and completely eliminate duplicate posts.  The repost frequency has been set to 14 days.  If this time period turns out to be too short, it will be extended.
3. If you check your user settings, you will see I am experimenting with some unique user flairs. Let me know your thoughts. To those of you who have suggested features that have been adopted by me, you will find a custom user flair for your exclusive use. I am a firm believer in giving credit where it is due, so this is my way of saying thanks.

t3_ihm0o2,$AGM aka Farmer Mac DD," 

# $AGM aka Farmer Mac Stock Analysis

**BACKGROUND**

**1) Who/What is Farmer Mac?**

Farmer Mac - hereon referred to as AGM for the sake of abbreviation - is to the agricultural industry what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are to the home mortgage industry. For those unfamiliar, all three are considered **GSE's** (**Government-Sponsored Enterprises)**.

2) **What does a GSE do?**

Basically GSE's act as secondary markets for mortgages and loans. In the primary market, a primary lender writes up a mortgage. This mortgage (or an asset of these mortgages) can then be sold to a secondary lender. The reason why these secondary lenders exist is because they are able to reduce the cost of capital on these mortgages/loans, making them more accessible to the general population.

In essence, a GSE like Farmer Mac improves access to credit.

3) **But wait, doesn't that mean GSE's take on toxic mortgage assets?**

In general, yes.

But there's a catch. Both the primary lenders that AGM purchases the bulk of these agriculture loans/assets from (the **Farm Credit System**) as well as AGM itself are both regulated by the **Farm Credit Association.**

The Farm Credit Association is an independent agency of the federal government which exists to regulate the financial institutions that provide credit to farmers.

In light of the Great Recession, the farm credit association has made tremendous leaps in ensuring **only the most conservative underwriting measures** to reduce the risk of default on these loans.

**FINANCIALS**

Now, here's the juicy part and why I think this is such a good investment. All this info is copy-pasted straight from their Q1 update:

* Net income attributable to common stockholders was $9.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share;
* • Core earnings, a non-GAAP measure was $20.1 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share;
* • Net interest income grew $0.7 million year-over-year to $41.3 million;
* • Net effective spread, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14% from the prior-year period to $44.2 million;
* **• 90-day delinquencies were 0.37% of total outstanding business volume as of March 31, 2020**
* **First quarter provision for credit losses of $3.8 million, largely driven by expected COVID-19 impact.**

Look at that provision for credit loss. It's only $3.8 million.That's **0.09%** of their outstanding business volume. That's nothing at all. This means they don't expect to face significant losses on their assets.

**Dividend**

* AGM has a near 5% dividend yield with a payout ratio of \~35%
* AGM recently raised the dividend from 0.70 per quarter to 0.80 per quarter

**LONG TERM OUTLOOK**

* U.S. government won't allow farmers to suffer tremendous losses on their loans. Agriculture is a heavily subsidized industry and massive losses on agricultural mortgages and loans would be a huge detriment to the U.S.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Dividend yield is nearly 5% with very low payout ratio (\~35%). The loans serviced are in the agriculture industry which is as safe as it gets (government won't let farmers fail to make payments on their loans). Revenue has been steadily increasing over time. Low interest rate environment provides good time to get in on this stock as income on interest spread can only get better over time.",9,1.0,1598538557.0
t3_ihlke1,What are your thoughts on banks after Powells speech?,"J Powell says the fed will allow higher inflation for longer periods of time, and therefor its no longer a goal to have ca 2% inflation yoy. Instead looking for an average inflation rate of 2% over a longer timeframe.

Seems like some people think that this is a sign for the future interest rate. That it will stay at 0% for the next years. Maybe longer than I expected myself(my estimate for increase in interest rate: early 2022 tops). This will ofcourse have a negative impact on banks income and therefore theyre dividend I think.

t3_iiee7s,r/dividends is hiring mods! (Plus some very important announcements),"Good afternoon r/dividends,

A lot has been happening behind the scenes recently regarding the state of this subreddit, so I will skip any buildup and get right into it.

Firstly, I would like to officially welcome Jack Larkin (aka u/finance_student), who has officially joined the moderator team.   I have brought him on to help turn Automoderator into more than just my copy-pasting default templates in a pattern that somehow works.  So be nice, be kind, and wish him luck because I have no idea how to code.

The second order of business is that I am officially hiring not one, not two, but **three additional moderators** for r/dividends.  Unlike Jack, these individuals will be active and participating members of the community who will be brought on to accomplish very specific tasks.  The three positions are each very different, and listed below.  Please read each one carefully.

1. **Old Reddit Ambassador**: As many of you know, I have absolutely zero experience coding anything complicated.  Unfortunately for me, Old Reddit does not care.  Anyone who has worked with Old Reddit knows the stylesheet page is simply a blank text box responsive to (I think) CSS code.  According to Reddit statistics, a large number of r/dividends userbase utilizes either Old Reddit, or 3rd party Reddit apps that are pulling data from Old Reddit.  I am fully committed to ensuring you guys have just as positive of a user experience as those of us who use new Reddit, so I am recruiting an experienced Reddit coder to assist in this task.  In essence, you would help me make r/dividends look good on Old Reddit and its third party apps.  That's all this position is.  You will serve as an ambassador to that community, and make sure our Old Reddit userw are having a great user experience.  You will not need to handle the mod queue or work on automoderator.
2. **Wiki Writer:** Another important goal of mine for this subreddit is the establishment of a wiki for any and all new dividend investors.  It will be an introductory guide walking new investors through everything they need to know to get started, so that hopefully I can eliminate every single ""Im X years old and don't know how to invest"" post.  Excellent writing skills will be required.

3. **Chat moderator:**  We are pleased to announce that [/r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends) is now live on Discord. Come join the conversation in our live chatroom!  To facilitate the live chat, we have partnered with other finance related subreddits and are joining an already established and very active server. Our new server hosts the official chats for [/r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading), [/r/forex](https://www.reddit.com/r/forex), and the FXGears communities, and boasts more than 1600 online members.  Our channels within the chat server are #dividend-investing and the #stocks-general / #stock-resources rooms, but of course you are encouraged to check out all subject matters hosted on the server.  You can find links to the new chat in the top navigational bar and the sidebar.  Individuals applying for this position would be responsible for overseeing the chat on these new channels.  You would be granted moderator status here on the subreddit and would be granted permissions necessary to enforce the rules accross both platforms. 

Those of you who wish to apply may send an application through modmail.  Applications will be open until Tuesday September 1, when I will start contacting the finalists. 

Edit: it was asked if mods were still allowed to participate in the community (apparently some subreddits want their mods to not interact with the subreddit unless they are acting as a mod.) I don't know what subreddits do that, but rest assured such a rule would not apply here. Any mods would still be free to post, comment, rate, etc. All the fun stuff. You can just think of being a mod as a side thing you do on the weekends or something if you want to. All I really need is people with the requisite skills who want to make the community better. You will get a custom flair of whatever you want, and you will get to help make this community a better place. 

&#x200B;

That concludes todays announcement.  Until next time.",14,0.82,1598645068.0
t3_iie7af,Is it worth holding both DGRO and SPHD?,"I'm currently a holder of a very small amount of DGRO which I'm looking to slowly increase over time. It's the closest to a total market ETF that I own since most of mine are more sector-oriented.

Many people around here are proponents of SPHD, probably for the monthly dividends. Is it worth holding both of these ETFs? Monthly dividends may be nice, but SPHD has a limited number of holdings and there's 36% overlap with DGRO. I'm afraid I'd be wasting time and resources putting money into both.

t3_ij2f2f,Strange Roth - looking for advice on a strategy I came up with,"I have been researching, looking up, wanting so many different ideas. I went from starting a robinhood and accorns 3 years ago to completely selling out, going back to RH and selling out. (Both to pay for debt and not have debt) to now realizing I need a roth and just to start one. So I did. I started a roth in M1. 

Now, I can't for the life of me figure out what I want to do for a strategy as M1 allows so much variety. I thought I ""broke the algorithm"" by figuring out that M1 auto invests everything back in for dividends and recurring payments that dividends are a great idea. So, my current portfolio has 100% dividend paying stocks. 30% of it is in VOO the rest besides like 5 (ETFs) are in stocks. 

But then I take a step back and realize, this is a Roth/IRA for a reason... its so I can hold this for retirement and create this for retirement and hopefully financial freedom. So I dont have high value stocks like Microsoft, Amazon, Paypal, Google, Spotify, and Netflix. I dont know if its that smart of me to not have some of the best companies in the world in a retirement account, but I want my account to grow through dividends. 

I realize that VOO is impacted by those stocks I listed above, so I am happy with that. I just wonder if my idea/method is stupid or if others see the logic that I see? My thought was between the monthly and quarterly dividend stocks buying themselves over and over again that creates a never ending cycle of growth that I could eventually live off of when I hit retirement age instead of selling stocks.",5,1.0,1598743231.0

t3_ij10ks,REITs or Real Estate?,"Hi everyone!

I’m a new dividend investor and have been researching tons of companies with strong financials to weather this pandemic without cutting their dividends.

It’s led me to invest in REITs such as O, SPG, and STAG. But as someone who was planning to invest in individual properties later down the road, I was wondering if I should even bother investing in REITs because of their tax conditions and instead invest that money into qualified dividends. 

Btw, I do invest in VNQ within a Roth IRA to circumvent the taxes, but I’m curious if I should invest the rest of my income into real estate or in to REITs or both. What are your opinions/thoughts?

t3_iizy2t,QYLD in a taxable portfolio with margin - stupid?,"Hello,

I have a 7 month emergency fund. A Roth IRA I’m maxing. A traditional IRA I’m mildly contributing to.

I have about 30k cash that I eventually want to use for a house or something in my checking that I can invest - but being mildly bearish wanted to kind of wait.

My idea was to take it and put it in a taxable account on QYLD, which yields 11% annually, and is somewhat safe imo for this market condition. 

Add 35% of margin on top of it @2% APY. 

All on DRIP.

t3_iiwt21,Dividends stocks out of favor?,"I have a diversified, quality dividend portfolio yielding about \~5% currently and 5.8% yield on cost.   My goal is to achieve a greater than 5% yield, so I am accomplishing that.  I am not too overweight any one sector, my two largest being Consumer Staples (17%) and Real Estate (14.5%).  Besides those two, no sector makes up more than 10% of the portfolio.   Lately, I have noticed that the market has become exceptionally bifurcated, and my portfolio is barely moving.  Perhaps I need to readjust sectors, but are high-quality dividend stocks out of favor?    One of my thoughts in putting together this portfolio is that with rates so low, healthy, mature dividend companies will gain favor, and their low valuations relative to the market should be able to sustain a near-term correction.  However, it seems that the market is busy chasing large tech -  FAANG, TSLA, MSFT, etc. - all overvalued for my taste.

I want to become financially independent by 45. I think there are a lot of people like me out there.

Would I be better off focus on growth for the next 12 - 18 years, and as I get closer to reaching a million or two, sell my growth investments off to purchase dividend payers? I plan to live off of dividends and real estate in retirement. 

Wouldn’t I probably be able to get a greater cash flow at 45 after selling growth at a profit? Hope my question makes sense. For transparency, I focus on income in my taxable account, and growth in my Roth.",16,0.94,1598710865.0

I would like to extend a personal thank you to each and every one of you who works to help make this community better. In this difficult time, it is truly heartwarming to see such a positive and friendly community that we are building here in this little corner of the internet.

I have spent virtually all my free time the past (almost) week working behind the scenes and around the community trying to improve everything from the quality of life on the subreddit to the quality of posts. A huge thank you to everyone who has been posting, commenting, interacting, and rating. Your interaction is what makes this subreddit worth tuning into for thousands of people every single day. 

Reddit analytics say that between 4900 and 7100 (average of 5,300+) unique accounts interact with this subreddit on a daily basis.  These users generate an average of 35,000 pageviews per day.  The vast majority do not directly interact with content. I state this specifically for those who post. That when you post here, your content is seen and read.  

One final note of thanks, and that is to those who report. Thanks to you, I have been able to see and find those who wish to create negative interactions or engage in shameless self promotion. Posts breaking every single rule have been removed since they went into effect five days ago. This is just a reminder that reporting is an effective tool to deal with rule breakers.  For those curious, only one ban has actually been issued to a real user (several have been issued to bots), and that user's ban will be expiring tomorrow.

On that note, I will conclude this announcement. Thank you all, and have a great day.

The answer to this is pretty simple, invest in companies that pay on diffrent frequencies. By owning 3 - 4 companies you can make a ""monthly"" paying portfolio compared to a single stock that pays monthly. Its better to chase the quality companies over the payment frequency and you can also be more diverse.

WHY I REGRET:

1. $150B in debt. That’s an insane total. Although to their credit they held true to their promises to prioritize paying off debt. 2 years ago it was at $180B

2. Seemingly everyone hates them, even their own customers. No one loves them

3. 5G infrastructure costs will probably be a significant burden on profitability/cash flow

4. A history of baffling and overpriced acquisitions, like DirecTV

5. They are now the smallest telecom provider of the Big 3, behind Verizon and post-merger TMobile

6. They strike me as an inefficient bureaucracy

7. Long term share price depreciation, despite a historical bull market

8. Mass exodus of Time Warner leaders since the acquisition


WHY I’M HOLDING

1. Love that dividend

2. HBO Max has growth potential comparable to Netflix. Share price growth could be comparable to Netflix’s too, right?

3. They’re selling off underperforming business units and becoming more agile/efficient

4. Holding telecom is like holding a utility, but supermassive and less accountable to society. And T pays the biggest dividend in telecom.

5. Too big to fail?

6. New, seemingly-refreshing, dynamic leadership in CEO John Stankey

t3_ilaf7n,The Global Brokerage Database,"Good Afternoon r/dividends,

In my seemingly ongoing attempt to torture myself, I have begun creating a Global Brokerage Database.  This will be included in the r/dividends Wiki currently in development.   One of the most commonly asked questions beginning investor's ask is ""What brokerage should I use?""  While it may be easy for some to say ""just google it,"" upon conducting some thorough research, I have realized there is no singular objective location listing every single brokerage in the world.  So I am going to create it.  The Database will be broken down by country.

To contribute, you simply need only comment **any** of the following information about your personal brokerage (or any brokerage within your country):

* Brokerage Name
* Your country
* Official brokerage website
* Minimum Investment
* Commission fees by Asset type
* Any Account Fees
* Premium Option
* Premium Cost
* Fractional Share Support?
* Dividend Reinvestment (DRIP) Support?
* Uninvested Cash interest rate?
* Types of Accounts offered?
* Country of Brokerage's origin
* What countries is your brokerage offered in
* Supported platforms
* Default Language
* Any additional relevant information that can't be compared to another brokerage.

&#x200B;

You may also send the information through modmail if you wish.  Please do not disclose any personal information.

*If you already see your brokerage listed in the comments, check and see if any of the provided information is incorrect or could be expanded upon.  Please leave these expansions as comment replies, so each brokerage only has one top level comment.  I will format all the information into the database and double check it for accuracy.*  If you would like to help with this task, contact me through modmail.

Thank you for your assistance in this task.

t3_il5xw6,"$FHN, reliable and good value?","Personally, I think $FHN (First Horizon National Corp) is a very good investment at the moment. The ex-dividend date for FHN is September 10th 2020, so 7 days from now.

FHN is a bank holding company based in Memphis, Tennessee. Its banking subsidiary, First Horizon, is the largest bank in Tennessee and the fourth largest regional banking company in the US Southeast.

They have increased their dividend every single year since 2013, and have a very attractive yield of 6.17%. I know some people might get spooked by this yield but they have weathered the Covid-19 storm far better than a lot of other banks, and are ranked as a Strong Buy by 7 of the 10 analysts that I could find to be tracking FHN. According to Zacks, the average price target for FHN is $12.17 (currently trading at $9.52) and the stock seems to be quite steady also - up almost 3 percent over the past month.

t3_il030b,Waste Management - Recession Proof Stock?,"Hi All, 

The next ex-dividend date for Waste Management is in 2 days, and I am looking for a solid company with broad exposure that is guaranteed to have a healthy dividend among this pandemic. Please see my analysis below and let me know your thoughts. 

1) Sales will be dampened near term, but the industry as a whole will grow approximately 6% by 2025.

2) Healthy Gross Profit Margin around 40%, with a positive EPS and trailing EPS

3) Current and Quick Ratio well above 1.2, which is a sign of servicing short term debt in an excellent manner in case needs arise. In times we are in, I take emphasis on these ratios. 

4) Of course what I am here for is the 1.86% dividend yield. While this stock won't get neck snapping returns like the rest of the market, I am guaranteed this dividend if we go into a long and deep recession/depression. There is only 1 larger competitor (Republic Services), but I think WM barely can call itself a duopoly and think they are one of the safest stocks for yield.

I am open to any thoughts and suggestions. I look forward to your comments!

When you setup a covered call. I'm thinking of doing the 2wk which is avail. for $O. When I setup my 10% rise on the call and someone actually purchases it, does it automatically take my shares at that moment and pay me so I can quickly reinvest and repurchase those 100 shares (now, 100+ with that credit), or does it wait until the end of the contract time and I could be potentially paying a lot more per share so I end up losing money?

t3_im1f6l,A Dividend Journey..,"Hi Reddit Family!

About a year ago now I discovered dividends and began researching into everything around them. Prior to discovering and really understanding dividends and how they work I had no savings whatsoever.

I was living more or less by a day to day philosophy and not thinking too heavily about the future, mainly because it seemed stressful and demoralising knowing that I wouldn’t be able to realistically retire early or live life from a passive income stand point perhaps until I received my pension.. in 30+years.

My only real get out in my head was perhaps winning a bet or the lottery, which hadn’t gone well thus far. 

I then came across dividend growth strategies from a few different content creators and began to read books on investing and became hooked on the whole outlook. 

The possibility of actually being able to live life without actively working whilst maintaining the same lifestyle became a real possibility with some dedication. I have a decent job with above average income but never had any discipline or a direct target, until now.

I’m starting from the ground up, every deposit into my portfolio has been an achievement and territory that i have never been in before in terms of saving/investing. 

I was never taught much about finance,investing or saving growing up so trying my best to absorb everything I can from everything and everyone. 

I hope that I can inspire others as I have been and would like to share my journey with whoever is interested here anyhow. 

I am using Trading 212 as a platform and have now accumulated £6200 in my portfolio consisting mainly of dividend stocks. I know it’s not much to some but it’s a start for me and a small achievement for myself.

I have just began a channel to track the journey on YouTube, if you have any spare time check it out and let me know what you think! Just go easy on me it’s my first venture into this. :-). Just search the dividend way.

t3_imd60h,Does it make sense to transition 401K ( ~50K)?,"There's about $50K in the 401K. It's made a whopping 2% return over the last few years. Honestly I've never seen that crazy of a portfolio for 401K, it's like an ETF with all sorts of holdings in bonds and weird MFs, which I know nothing about. (Don't invest into something you don't understand).

I propose to move it over to roth IRA and split into:

O - real estate exposure

HD or WM  - seem to be solid. Unlikely to be disrupted by any ""tech"" in the next 20 years.

And SPHD - monthly drip 

Possibly SCHD - I think it's a very solid ETF.

I have additional investments in crypto and some tech ETFs so I'm still relatively diversified. But that 401K isn't working.

**Edit, I'm definitely dropping HD, for some reason I thought it was $86/share. WM probably not going to make the cut.
For a ""dividend"" buy-in, I don't want to look at anything above $100. Basically I don't see any reason to get something at $300 / share, if they pay you $.45 quarterly. I'm looking for more income to make drip compound faster.

For growth I have exposure through other ETFs, where dividend income / drip isn't the primary goal.

Long story short, my current plan is to go 30/30/20/20 on:

The two issues I saw is that they're a decent yield in the taxable and not efficient. The other issue was that they are weighted much more than most of his other stocks. At first selling seemed like the best option but the most I thought about it would taking dividend reinvestment off of these two make more sense? And then dividends can be reinvested into other stocks? Over 7 years it seems like it would rebalance a little bit by reducing them a few percentage points over the years.

t3_io9hds,An unnecessarily detailed explanation of the rules that nobody asked me for,"The title says it all.  This post will be linked somewhere as an FAQ of sorts for any individual who has questions about the rules of this subreddit.  These rules were developed through feedback and dialogue with the community, so they are enforced with vigor.  Feedback is always accepted in regards to the rules, so they should not be considered unchangeable.  If this community wants a rule change, make a post under the ""Meta"" flair, and make a compelling argument.  If the community approves, I (the moderator who enforces the rules) will change the rules.

&#x200B;

>**1. No self Promotion:** Posting to promote user-generated YouTube videos, blog posts, advertisements, websites, surveys, etc. all fall under this category.

Q. *What does this rule cover?*

A. ""Hey guys, check out my \[insert content here\].""  In all seriousness, We do not care what it is.  If you made it, you do not get to post it here.  End of discussion.

*Q. What exceptions are there to this rule?  Every rule has exceptions right?*

None.  The etc. is meant to cover every possible form of self-promotion imaginable.  Surveys, cryptocurrencies, and ""professional"" hacking services are just some of the things posted here that I have removed under the [etcetera](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/etcetera) clause.

>**2. All advice must be given in good faith:** This is a community dedicated to the sharing of genuine advice. As we want to help people prepare for their entire financial future, advice shown to be given in bad faith will be removed with no warning. Repeated violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban.

The definition of what advice is considered good faith is very hard to pin down, as there are some people who genuinely have no idea how to invest, yet are trying to help other people invest.  As such, I have been reluctant to remove posts for this reason.  I tend to leave enforcement of this rule up to Automoderator, using its filters and Reddit's aggressive site-wide spam filters.

One example of a time where I did not sit on the sidelines and removed a comment directly under this rule was when a user suggested the best way to get rich was to take out a seven figure loan, load up on T and MO, then use the dividends to pay off the loan.  Any experienced or even beginner investor could tell you dozens of things wrong with this idea, and judging by the user's post history, it was clear the post was not in good faith, so it was removed.

>**3.**  **No encouraging insider trading, violations of SEC/ESMA guidelines, or other unlawful activity**

Perhaps the simplest rule to understand.  Do not suggest people do illegal things.  Plain and simple.  When determining what is legal or not, I am looking at US and EU laws primarily, as well as laws from places like Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, etc.

So if you are a member of the LGBT+ community, do not worry.  I will not remove your comment if you mention being gay or something like that.  Or if there are any third world countries out there with some obscure law against owning too many goats or whatever, you goat hoarders can rest easy.

>**4. No solicitations for due diligence:** Do not create a thread with the specific intention of getting other users to research a company or companies for you. If you want to start a genuine discussion about a particular company or companies, let us know your thoughts.

This rule is the most commonly violated by a mile and a half.  Nearly 40% of all posts and comments removed by me violate this rule.  No other rule comes within 10 percentage points in terms of rule violations.  This is also the rule that went through the most revisions when the rules were being developed.  It is the main reason I am even writing this post, so let me explain it.

Rule Four is designed to prevent posts like this one:

>**AT&T**  
>  
>Looks like a great stock.  Anyone here own it?  Seems high on the analysts lists too

Notice the title is the name of a random company (changed to protect the OPs privacy) and the description devoid of details.  While I did not contact the user who posted this, I can guess their intentions were for someone to research the company for them and tell them if it was a good investment or not.  This is an almost textbook definition of a solicitation for due diligence.

This does not mean you are not allowed to ask other users for their thoughts when posting.  Quite the opposite.  Every post should be taken as an invitation for other users to share their thoughts.  The way to not break this rule is really simple.  Give people something interesting to talk about.  Or if you want a more nuanced explanation, tell people what you know about the company or companies and try to spark a genuine discussion.

[This is a gold standard example of how to spark discussion about a company.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/il030b/waste_management_recession_proof_stock/) I link this post by u/ForehandFinancial to demonstrate how easy it is to post something good, substantive, and high-quality.  It makes you want to scroll down and read the comments.  Notice how they have already done their due diligence, citing numbers, and states they are looking for additional thoughts and suggestions not previously considered.

&#x200B;

>**5. Do not critique another user based on the size of their portfolio:** Especially in this economy, people are trying to set aside whatever they can. Do not judge how much other people have in their bank account. You do not know what they are experiencing.

I hate how this has to be a rule, but unfortunately some people are just rude to each other.  Reddit has site-wide rules against harassment and threats.  This is just a refinement of that rule into an investing community mindset.  Pretty self explanatory.

&#x200B;

>**6. No referral links**:  Links generated when sharing one's portfolio through brokerages like M1 are exempt.

This could technically loop back around into Rule 1, as it is self-promotion.  Most brokerages have these, and will give you money or stocks if you convince someone to sign up using them.  Some brokerages also have a button that allows you to share your portfolio.  For example, [this is my M1 Portfolio](https://m1.finance/wbI3wBr2ioGc).  If I could remove the link I would, but since I cannot, these kinds of links are allowed since they have a separate purpose.

t3_io4sol,ETFs vs individual stocks for dividend growth?,"So I'm thinking of starting a dividend portfolio. I will put in about $500 a month, with a starting value of $1,500. I am thinking about going with 3 different ETFs, 33% of each: SPHD, PEY, and SPLV.  I am new to dividend investing, but these 3 ETFs pay monthly and are fairly secure from what I understand. If this is a less effective option for dividend growth, I'd be fine with taking the time to invest in individual stocks / better ETFs / rebalancing the %. Let me know what you guys think, thanks :)

All 3 have ex-dividend dates in the next month. I hope you find this useful, and please let me know your thoughts in the comments!

# First Horizon National Corp. (FHN)

Founded in 1864, First Horizon National Corporation (ticker: FHN) is a bank holding company based in Memphis, Tennessee. Its banking subsidiary, First Horizon, is the largest bank in Tennessee and the fourth largest regional bank in Southeast USA. They employ over 5000 employees at over 250 bank locations across the Southeast of the US.

*Key points:*

**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 10th September 2020

**Dividend Yield**

Currently, FHN has a Dividend Yield of 6.02%. This a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. FHN paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $6.40 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 40% from that low.

**Dividend Payout Ratio: 62.37%**

Ideally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - however, FHN have a history of paying a steadily increasing dividend. For 14 years – from 1993 to 2007, FHN increased their dividend yearly – with the only exception being 2000-2001 when they maintained it. Furthermore, from 2011 to the present, FHN have increased their dividend yearly – with the only exception being 2013-2014 when they maintained it.

**Price to Book Ratio: 0.60**

As of July 2020, FHN stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.60, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $16.67, with a share price of $9.96 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $9.60). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.

**Institutional Ownership**

FHN have 57.60% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.

# Valley National Bancorp (VLY)

Founded in 1927, Valley National Bancorp (ticker: VLY) is a bank holding company based in Wayne, New Jersey. Its banking subsidiary, Valley Bank, currently operates over 230 branch locations in northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, as well as Long Island, Florida, and Alabama. They employ over 3000 employees.

*Key points:*

**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 14th September 2020

**Dividend Yield**

Currently, VLY has a Dividend Yield of 5.61%. Like FHN, this is also a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. VLY paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $6.02 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 16% from that low.

**Dividend Payout Ratio: 56.90%**

Ideally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - however, VLY have maintained their dividend for the past 5 years, with the stock price largely stable during this time as well. According to Zacks, of the 8 analysts tracking VLY – 4 recommended it as a ‘Buy’, 3 as a ‘Hold’ and just one as a ‘Sell’. The average price target is currently $9.22, which is a decent upside of about $2 per share.

**Price to Book Ratio: 0.71**

As of July 2020, VLY stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.71, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $11.08, with a share price of $7.82 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $7.46). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.

**Institutional Ownership**

VLY have 61.90% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.

# Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV)

Founded in 1888, Synovus Financial Corporation (ticker: SNV) is a bank holding company based in Columbus, Georgia. Its banking subsidiary, Synovus Bank, operates 294 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. They employ over 5000 employees. Other non-bank subsidiaries that are wholly-owned by SNV include Synovus Securities, Synovus Trust, Synovus Mortgage, Creative Financial Group and Global One.

*Key points:*

**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 16th September 2020

**Dividend Yield**

Currently, SNV has a Dividend Yield of 5.96%. Again, this is a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. SNV paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $12.12 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 70% from that low.

**Dividend Payout Ratio: 48.60%**

Ideally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - so the Dividend Payout Ratio of 48.60% for SNV is exactly what we want to see. In addition to this, SNV have a history of paying a steadily increasing dividend. For 14 years – from 1993 to 2007, SNV increased their dividend yearly without fail. Furthermore, from 2013 to the present, SNV have increased their dividend yearly.

**Price to Book Ratio: 0.60**

As of July 2020, SNV stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.60, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $34.30, with a share price of $20.53 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $21.78). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.

**Institutional Ownership**

SNV have a whopping 81.00% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.

On 4 August 2020, Synovus also announced a donation of $1 million to UNCF (United Negro College Fund) to set up The Synovus / Calvin Smyre Scholarship Campaign. The fund will include scholarships in Synovus' five-state presence for African American students to attend historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other higher education institutions. It is great to see that Synovus Bank supports the fantastic cause of providing greater opportunity for young black men and women in the US.",126,0.97,1599605314.0
t3_ip0pd6,"Starting out my dividend portfolio, considering ARR?","I’m relatively new to all this, and would like some pointers. I’m looking to start my dividend portfolio, transitioning out of my oil and gas heavy portfolio into something a little more stable and building a source of income. I’m 31, have $1000 liquid at the moment, and will have 10-20k more laying around sometime next year if I can get out of the red and sell my current holdings. I’m also looking at eventually contributing to my dividend fund aggressively out of pocket, as well as with my DRIP. O and STAG are definitely on my list of “to buy” and I have been considering ARR. O and Stag are simply big choices due to word of mouth, I feel my ability to do DD is pretty lacking. I could use a link or two that could dumb things down to where I can do more effective DD than simply looking at the news and dividend history. Any pointers?

Also, in regards to ARR, I like how it looks, it appears that I can make good returns with it, and while the dividend has been scaled back recently, it is still a decent position in my eyes. The dividends have been paid consistently for 7-8 years, and while they fluctuate, they are consistently paid. What else should I look at before picking up said shares?

t3_ioxf10,Dividends vs Growth/Index Funds,"Hi all,

I wanted to pose an idea and open a discussion to the group. I am a younger investor with a long time horizon (30+ years).

I’ve been investing for a little while now, but mostly heavy in tech and index funds.

My specific question: What are the benefits of investing in dividend stocks rather than dumping your money into SPY, or QQQ (SPY & NASDAQ index fund equivalent)? Both of these indexes are quite diversified across all the companies they are comprised of. Granted, they are both focused on tech but will automatically weed out any poor companies over time.

When I compare the historical returns of SPY against T, SPHD, O, or even VYM for example, they aren’t even close. SPY has outperformed both of these stocks significantly.

I am not hating on dividends... I’m trying to educate myself as an investor to understand why they are so popular, and if I should invest in them myself.

Please note that my question is tailored to folks who have a longer time horizon, not people who are near retirement and need a more steady income stream.

I know when holding a mutual fund, they just increase your share size and deduct managing cost from your holdings, but how does it work with ETFs?

I haven't also paid any managing fees!

Good yield, steady price (and a reasonable one at that), good exposure into tech for diversification (a lot of tech is more growth oriented), and has paid a steady dividend (two drops in the last decade). I know it’s not on the cutting edge of tech, but I also think it’s more of a dividend/value play than a growth play. 

Am I looking at a horse that’s long in the tooth? Meaning - has the industry past CTL by and I’m grasping at straws?

On paper - it seems like a solid dividend play through and through. But I don’t see much talk of it.

t3_ipn37q,Industrials Pie,"RTX, GD or LMT. 

I originally purchased RTX as it had been beaten down following the spin off of CARR and Covid - (ex?) dividend king and has been solid in the past with a 3.49% yield and 44% payout ratio. Diversified into military and civilian areas. 

GD is one which I must admit I bought on a whim at the start of my dividends career... I read about their products,  orders etc. and decided yeah why not. Since then they have had trouble with unions, fires on ships and generally not a great time. They are still heavily beaten down from Covid, have a 2.9% yield and a 33% payout ratio.

LMT is one that I do not own, but have had my eye on. I was put off this one at the beginning of my career due to the share price and slightly lower yield. They make the F-35 jets which are just being introduced around t he world and probably more on the pipeline. 2.49% yield with a payout ratio of 41%. They don’t seem to have been beaten down as much which says to me that their revenues shouldn’t have been impacted as much as the others. 

What I am leaning towards doing is dumping RTX or GD (maybe both) and going in with only LMT.

For me this would help with only having to read up on one company, the share price seems to be a bit more stable, more orders to be filled. Maybe I’m talking rubbish though.

Should you remove XOM from your portfolio? I don’t know. But if *you* think you should, you’d better do it soon. If they slash that dividend, the stock will plummet. My guess is a 60-70% div cut followed by a 30-40% drop in market cap as investors exit.

t3_isk15q,Question about dividends not being taxed?,"I saw a couple things on YouTube and some other internet sites but am always skeptical of advice I come across this way unless I can actually find where this is listed. I forget what the exact amount was but basically the advice was about it being possible to not have to pay taxes on dividends if you’re income is below 35kish (again I don’t remember the exact number). Now I’m not sure if this means your income from dividends or capitals gains needs to be below that, your total income (capitals gains and job) needs to be below that or if just your job income needs to be below that but is that true? The way it was made to seem was that I could earn 80k a year but as long as my dividends were below that 35kish number then I wouldn’t pay taxes.

Recessions are really dangerous for BDCs in general, much less something affecting small businesses in particular. I see they've lent to restaurants and things like pool-builders whereas another prominent BDC ARCC is way more focused on software and healthcare. They do trade at a premium to NAV which means raising capital is easier for them whereas ARCC is trading at a slight discount--keeping in mind discount to NAV is not a good thing for these kinds of companies unlike ETFs or whatever else. 

They survived the Great Recession well enough along with ARCC but does anyone get concerned when they see the kind of companies MAIN works with in this environment?

Why though?

Here's my perspective: in this space there's not a whole lot of excitement going on. Tyson seems to be the only established company in this sector with a clear dedication to innovation. Their ventures, labs, and innovation branches of the business are a major focus of the company. That makes me feel better about their future, because I see that the management is not only focused on packaging chicken.
At one point they put a fair amount of money into Beyond Meat, but I believe since have dropped the brand in favor of developing their own.

The fundamentals look pretty solid, and with a target price of $70-80 and ~2% dividend yield, it's one of the few stocks that I really like.

t3_ito6xf,The public beta of the Wiki is now live. Plus a logo now exists.,"Quick announcement:

&#x200B;

Good afternoon r/dividends,

For over a week I have been teasing a Wiki and FAQ for new users to seek advice.  I am pleased to announce that my head wiki writer u/Dan-El- is ready to unveil Beta version 1.0 of the Wiki/FAQ.  It can now be accessed in the sidebar.  All users posting under the ""beginner seeking advice"" tab, expect your post to be removed if it contains a question answered in the FAQ.  

A quick reminder.

1. This is very much a beta. Do not expect it to be complete by any stretch of the imagination.  (Daniel is still doing an amazing job though!)

2. Please notify the mod team in a polite manner if you notice any typos.  English is not Daniel's first language (he is from Germany).  Since he and I live on almost opposite sides of the globe, it can take a few hours for errors to be corrected.

3. We are looking for all the help we can get to make the Wiki the best it can be.  If you would like to contribute, please reach out to me directly through reddit's direct message system (I dislike modmail's UI.)

&#x200B;

Pivoting from the wiki to another topic of note.  r/dividends now has an official logo!  Will it be the permanent logo?  I have no idea.  If you have a better logo, send it to me.  I was tired of looking at the default Saturn with rings.  So I spent ten minutes and fixed it.  The logo is very similar to the r/stocks logo, except for a few key modifications I photo-shopped.  

Firstly, the suit is blue (because blue suits are objectively better).  Second, the image on the billboard is taken directly from Figure 8 of this [Hartford Funds research paper on the power of dividends](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/market-perspectives/the-power-of-dividends.html).  In effect, this is a subtle reference that dividend stocks are objectively better than the so-called ""growth stocks.""  Finally, the snoovatar's left arm has been moved to its side, because this investor has a dividend growth portfolio, so he does not need to manage his money as actively as the investor in the r/stocks logo.  

(side note: reading this out loud to my wife.  Her opinion is that she is glad I have found a hobby, but is slightly concerned.  Not with my investment philosophy, but with my determination to this subreddit. She always says I put too much effort into things I enjoy even slightly.  Thanks r/dividends)

Final thing. R/dividends has custom community awards. When you use them, the community itself receives coins. A few people have been using them, but I really want to be able to use the community awards system to give away premium to those who make the most valuable contributions.

Sales grew 21% last quarter, although some of this could be attributed to lockdowns and stockpiling.

Proceeds from the SPAC have been used to pay off debt and more will be spent on advertising and marketing to both retain new customers and entice more. 

Even while private they have expanded their portfolio of brands via acquisitions.

Fourth largest snack brand in the US by sales in 2019.

Their goal is to be the fastest growing pure-play branded snack platform of scale in the US.

Paying a dividend of $0.2 per share this year.

They aren’t a dividend king or aristocrat at the moment. But the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this one was too big too miss. Their payout is low enough that there is plenty of room for growth as their revenues increase.

After well sell the house we plan to bring our investment account up to $100k in two years and then start invest $4k monthly. I also use tsp around %10 for my retirement account. This $2k would be for our taxable TD Ameritrade account. I plan to retire in 15 years with a pension around $5.5k a month and then use dividend income to push that to $9-10k monthly at age 48.

Looking to balance my portfolio as listed here Looking for some feedback before I start stacking $2k monthly.

$AAPL 11%
$DGRO 11%
$SDY 11%
$IBM 10%
$MSFT 10%
ABBV 8%
$T 8%
$GD 8%
$ORCL 7%
$CSCO 6%
$NKE 4%
$FRT 2%
$MAIN 2%
$O 2%

My taxable income is below $80k, around $50k since most of my pay is entitlements and isn't taxed in the military. I've got room for 30k~ qualified dividends to be taxed at 0% for now.

I've been evaluating my retirement situation using calculators and estimates all over the place to make sure I'm on track and to try to optimize where I'm putting my money. I have a 401k which is projected to be enough for me to retire on as long as my house payment plan doesn't go through the floor. I'm a little late to the game but I just opened a Roth IRA with plans of using it for dividend returns to supplement the 401k and minimize my taxes in retirement (I'm 35, solid job, planning to retire around 60, 10% into 401k, working on paying off debt currently and almost done).

I did a lot of extensive research into dividend stocks, screeners, I think I have a watchlist saved somewhere I was going to invest in but recently got a promotion and if I'm honest with myself, I won't have as much time as I'd like to keep up with an individual stock portfolio. I started looking into ETFs with decent yield such as VYM, SPHD, and SPYD (basically crossed off the list, I've heard bad vibes with that one) and possible NOBL due to the aristocrats. The function of yield and account value/stock price isn't lost on me, but it all basically boils down to share count right? I tossed around the idea of investing the ROTH into an index fund and cashing it out at retirement and investing that money into a dividend ETF or such, and now I'm looking into just investing into VYM in the Roth and supplementing with my 401k until I hit Min distribution requirements. 

Ok, so wall of text complete. I think my question boils down too this, do ETF's have a history of increasing dividends or do they stay relatively chaotic? Is it possible to semi accurately project what you'd expect your dividend income to be in 25-30 years with an ETF? I've been trying to find historical information on them and they don't seem to steadily increase as a stock would so trying to hash out the math is proving difficult. I tend to overthink everything too, if that wasn't obvious. I'm looking to invest the weekly amount required to hit the yearly cap and investing most/all of that into a dividend ETF for inherent diversification and relative safety (strongly leaning towards VYM) and would like other's opinion on whether this is a terrible idea. The main reason I'm not trying to overly diversify is due to the target date fund in the 401k already. I'll leave it at this and answer questions as needed.",2,0.75,1600726572.0

I am interested in ETFs tracking aristocrats/growing dividends. So I was wondering, as the ETF contains this kind of stocks, the distributed ETF dividend will be also ""growing""... however my findings so far are not saying so, is my assumption wrong?

Here the ETF I was analyzing:

**EUDV**: ProShares MSCI Europe Dividend Growers ETF

As indicated in the fact sheet:

*Invests in MSCI Europe companies that have increased dividends each year for at least 10 consecutive years.*

However, just checking in yahoo finance on the historical distributed dividends, I see:

|*Year*|*Total Distributed Dividend*|
|:-|:-|
|2019|0.986|
|2018|0.808|
|2017|0.975|
|2016|0.719|

How could it be possible that the ETF is distributing a lower amount in dividends in 2018 than in 2017 if all tracked companies have been increased the dividend?

After 2 years of investing in individual dividend stocks I’ve built around a $60k portfolio that yields just over 3%. I’ve also seen decent capital appreciation over that time. No S&P 500 level returns, but I also made it through the current pandemic so far relatively unscathed with only one stock (WFC) cutting it’s dividend.

My question to the community is this. Does anyone strictly use their earned dividend income to buy shares in growth stocks or ETFs that may or may not pay a dividend rather than DRIPing? Now that trades our free with my brokerage I’ve turned off DRIP on all my stocks and manually reinvest them in whichever stock in my portfolio I see fit.

t3_j0tt3k,"Seeking advice on dividend plays - STWD versus T, VZ","I am 45 years old. Just started into stocks this year. I like the idea of having a regular annual income from a dividend play after retirement. I am a little bit confused about one thing. A lot of people recommend T and VZ for example (respectively 28-ish and 58-ish a share right now). If I understand dividends correctly, you get paid per share. I dont understand why people dont prefer to invest in a cheaper option like STWD as opposed to T or VZ. Here are my basic comparisons if you have $2000 to invest as an example: STWD - $255/year; T - $144/year; $VZ - 69/year

STWD:

15/share

annual dividend payout - 1.92/share

$2000 gets you \~133 shares (133 shares \* $15)

retirement income: 133 shares \* 1.92 = 255.36/year in dividends

general remarks: stock has been slowly rising over the year; average rating is Buy; not a Dividend aristocrat, but most dividends seem to be paid (growth toward DA status?)

T:

28/share

annual dividend payout - 2.04/share

$2000 gets you \~71 shares (71 shares \*$28)

retirement income: 71 shares \* 2.04 = 144.84/year in dividends

general: its down pretty hard; lots of debt; large potential to swing up in the long term

VZ:

58/share

annual dividend payout - 2.46/share

$2000 gets you \~34 shares (34\*$58)

retirement income: 34 shares \* 2.46 = $69.36/year in dividends

general: seems to be pretty solid performer

I am assuming that someone would only go for VZ over the other 2 if they want to see large growth because the dividend is going to be significantly smaller. Am I looking at this the right way? Does anyone have recommendations for a very cheap and conservative long term dividend play thats going to net me the most dividend payout income when I retire? Any thoughts on STWD versus other similarly priced dividend artistocrats or other similarly priced dividend plays? AMCR and STWD both seem really interesting to me. Thoughts on GE or Ford? Im thinking of putting my eggs in 2-3 different baskets.  Maybe STWD was a much better play when it fell to $9 in March than it is now?

I also dont understand the whole dividend stock versus dividend ETF.   A dividend ETF is just like any other stock isn't it?   There's no dividend payout.  I thought the reason why dividend aristocrats have such a large upside is because of their almost guaranteed dividend.

t3_j0ii21,My DD on Macatawa Bank Corporation (MCBC). Please critique it!,"I just wanted to start off by saying I am still fairly new to the market, having only started November of 2018. This is my first time doing DD on a bank and also my first time writing up DD to share with others, so please critique it! Let me know if there are metrics I should have used, ones I shouldn't have used, the format of the post, etc. 

**SUMMARY**

Macatawa Bank Corporation (NASDAQ: MCBC) is the holding company for Macatawa Bank. Macatawa Bank is a Michigan chartered bank with 26 full service branches in Kent County, Ottawa County, and northern Allegan County. Banking services include commercial, consumer, and real estate financing, business and personal deposit services, ATM's, Internet banking Services, trust and employee benefit plan services. 

**The Stock**

Currently MCBC is trading at $6.35 versus a book value of $6.37. Year to date, MCBC is down 42.95% compared to the iShares US Regional Banks ETF down 32.51%. MCBC is currently yielding 5% with a payout ratio of 36.36% for 3 months ending June 30th. Their payout ratio for 2019 was 30%. 

**Behind the Scenes**

The CET1 ratio compares a bank's capital to its assets, measuring how well capitalized a bank is to withstand unexpected losses. Currently MCBC has a CET1 ratio of 14.9% meaning they are well capitalized, compared to the industry average of 12%. The minimum set by the Basel III Accord is 7%.  They have a Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 14.9%, compared to the 8.5% minimum allowed. 

Since 2015, MCBC has enjoyed increasing revenue every year, growing from $65.4 million in 2015 to $83.7 million in 2019. Likewise, they have seen increasing net income every year since 2015, with 12.8 million in 2015 to 32 million in 2019.  They have a safe debt to equity (D/E) ratio of .90 for 6 months ending June 30th, 2020. For 2019, their D/E ratio was .89. 

Even with interest rates being near zero, the increase in mortgages helped MCBC beat expectations in Q2. Ronald Hann, CEO, stated ""Despite the challenging environment in the second quarter of 2020, we produced $7.6 million in earnings for the quarter.  Mortgage gains in the second quarter of 2020 were three times higher than a year ago and more than offset the reduction in net interest income caused by the significant decrease in market interest rates in 2020.""

**Conclusion**

Overall, I think this is an extremely attractive entry point for MCBC, even with the inherent risk they carry being a regional bank. They are capitalized extremely well, leaving them plenty of room to continue to pay their dividend, and along with their strong balance sheet, are well positioned to weather out this market environment.",27,0.94,1601171410.0

Edit: after some more digging came up with the following:
- Humira revenu went from 60% to total of 17% revenue (sources https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/abbvie-down-on-humira-patent-loss%3A-is-more-damage-in-store-2017-05-18 and https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/26/4-reasons-abbvie-is-more-attractive-than-you-think/)

- Allergan revenue was last year 16B (source https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/allergan-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019-financial-results-301001646.html) but maybe inflated because of aggressive sales (wouldn’t be the first time a firm pumps up their numbers to cash in on an aquisition)

Why is chasing dividends is better than just sitting everything in ETFs like VTI.

Disclaimer: This is broad information I have learned on my journey through investing. I have tried to do my research but cannot guarantee everything below is 100% up to speed. You should always do your own research as well !

The portfolio: https://m1.finance/SueDRtc7ioXN

One thing to keep in mind here is that this is not strictily a dividend portfolio. It also contains elements geared toward growth. The idea being that somewhere down the line ill harvest the growth and dump it into more income generating assets when im older. The weighted percentage of the allocations as they are now is also simply a reflection of how I want auto-invest to spread out the money. The actual weight of the individual holdings is slightly different.

If you want a really well thought out portfolio that is strictly geared toward generating income with a low expense ratio, opportunities for appreciation and low volatility I highly recommend checking out this portfolio put together by rao-blackwell-ized on the M1 finance subreddit. https://m1.finance/HwnAhLIW6Mp6

You can read about the methodology behind his creation of this pie [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/M1Finance/comments/go08t3/i_created_a_dividend_pie_for_you_guys/) which is a highly worthy post on its own. 

**Tax efficiency** 

You should start by maxing out an IRA or at the very least contributing to one. Dividends earned in traditional IRAs are not taxed when they are paid or reinvested, rather retirement account withdrawals are taxed at one's current income tax when they are withdrawn. Roth IRA funds grow tax-exempt, including the payment of dividends, and so these are not subject to taxation.

For me personally I just picked a target date fund in my IRA and let it ride. I wanted to pursue dividend investing in a taxable account so that I could use the dividends if I wanted to to supplement my current income. The perfect example being back in march when I was furloughed and it took forever to get on unemployment. My dividends bought groceries that month. 

You have to ask yourself what YOU want and what your goals are for dividend investing. Now onto the meat and potatoes of the post !

**Qualified vs Non qualified dividends** 


There are two types of ordinary dividends: qualified and nonqualified. The most significant difference between the two is that nonqualified dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates, while qualified dividends receive more favorable tax treatment by being taxed at capital gains rates.

What classifies a dividend as ‘qualified’ for tax purposes?

 Ordinary dividends are the most common type of distribution from a corporation or a mutual fund - as they are paid out of earnings and profits. Examples of ordinary dividends that do not qualify for preferential tax treatment include:

* Generally, dividends paid out by real estate investment trusts (there are instances where dividends can be considered qualified, provided certain requirements are met - - See IRC §857(c))
Generally, dividends paid out by master limited partnerships (However, if the MLP is invested in qualifying corporations and it receives qualified dividends from those investments, it would pass out qualified dividends to the partners)
* Dividends paid on employee stock option plans
* Dividends paid by tax-exempt companies
* Dividends paid on savings or money market accounts by mutual savings banks, mutual insurance companies, credit unions and other loan associations

I see alot of people investing heavily into REIT's because of their attractive yield. Thats well and fine if you know what you're buying but keep in mind REIT's are taxed at a higher rate than other dividends and some can carry volatility because of the assets they invest in (shopping malls, brick and mortar retail etc.) For this reason it is my opinion that REIT's should only be held in tax differed accounts like an IRA to maximize your tax efficiency. Bonds are a good alternative to REIT's. The yield might not be as high but they're much more stable. 

**Choosing stocks vs index funds** 

There are alot of great companies out there paying attractive yields but you shouldnt get caught up chasing the yield if the company itself is performing poorly. If the company does not have the fundamentals to support its dividend then you could be at risk of it lowering or disappearing all together down the line. 

I would take a lower yield from a company with a track record for growth and increasing its dividend every time over a company with a high yield but is struggling to support itself. In a buy and hold type setting, you want to ensure that what you pick is set up for long term success. 

The [Dividend aristocrats](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-aristocrats/) are a good place to look for quality companies that have a history of increasing dividends.

This leads me to my point in choosing what to invest in. If you dont have the time or willingness to track individual stocks, then I highly recommend just going with a broad index fund approach. The yield may be lower but ETF's are inherently more resilient against downturns and market volatility since theyre a package deal of many individual holdings and can provide easy diversity in your portfolio. One thing to keep in mind though is overlap. If you invest in multiple index funds theres a good chance those ETF's may hold positions of the same stock. Thats fine if you're ok with increased exposure to that particular holding but it IS something to be aware of. 

You can use the fund overlap tool at https://www.etfrc.com/index.php to see the overlap in your index funds.

**Expense ratios**

These fees — inherent in all mutual funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds — can significantly drag down your portfolio returns. And although they can’t be avoided completely if you invest in these funds, you can take steps to keep these costs as low as possible.

What is an expense ratio?
An expense ratio is an annual fee expressed as a percentage of your investment — or, like the term implies, the ratio of your investment that goes toward the fund’s expenses. If you invest in a mutual fund with a 1% expense ratio, you’ll pay the fund $10 per year for every $1,000 invested. That money is swept out of your investment in the fund, meaning you won’t get a bill for the charge. That’s one reason why these fees are easy to miss. Looking for funds with low expense ratios is key to making sure your making the most efficient use of your money.

**Bonds and Treasuries** 

This is an often overlooked area in dividend investing. While bonds pay interest as opposed to a dividend meaning theyre taxed at your normal income rate, they carry much more stability than REIT's. Treasuries and municipal bonds may also be exempt from federal or state taxes all together depending on a number of factors.
 
* Interest income generated by municipal bond funds is generally not subject to federal taxes, and may also be exempt from state and local taxes if the bonds held by the fund were issued by the state in which you live.

* Funds that exclusively hold U.S. Treasury bonds may be exempt from state taxes. 

Bonds represent the debts of issuers, such as companies or governments. These debts are sliced up and sold to investors in smaller units - for instance, a $1 million debt issue may be allocated to one-thousand $1,000 bonds. In general, bonds are considered to be more conservative investments than stocks, and are more senior to stocks if an issuer declares bankruptcy. Bonds also typically pay regular interest payments to investors, and return the full principal loaned when the bond matures. As a result, bond prices vary inversely with interest rates, falling when rates go up and vice-versa.

The bond markets are a very liquid and active, but can take second seat to stocks for many retail or part time investors. It is often for professional investors, pension and hedge funds, and financial advisors, but that doesn't mean that part-time investors should steer clear of bonds. In fact, bonds play an increasingly important part in your portfolio as you age and, because of that, learning about them now makes good financial sense. In fact having a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds is advisable for investors of all ages and risk tolerance.

Im comfortable with paying a higher tax rate on bonds because I know theyre stable and can provide a safe harbor to generate income while preserving capital against downturns and inflation.

**In conclusion**

Dividend investing can be a great way to pursue your financial goals. The thing you have to remember about investing in general is that regardless of your approach or strategy it is simply a financial vehicle to get you from point A to B. Understanding the fundamentals of dividend investing (your tax liability, what to invest in, your risk tolerance etc) are all important factors to figure out before you yeet your money into the ether of the market. There is an incredible amount of information to digest so give it time and dont get discouraged. This is a buy and hold approach with a long timeline !",308,0.97,1601498405.0

Although I do believe these are solid stocks to own, I've recognized during this pandemic that investing in great companies with low payout ratios (Less than 60%)  and good dividend growth rates (greater than 7%) tend to produce better returns and are much less likely to cut their dividends. As a result, I've grown to appreciate  quality companies such as NEE, WM, MSFT, and Apple that have very promising futures despite paying a lower dividend. With that being said, i have been making many adjustments for optimal returns and would really appreciate insightful feedback. Here's a link to my portfolio:

At the end of the 1st Quarter I dumped REITs without regard for when they went ex-dividend.  Normally when exiting a market sector I do it gradually and collect as many dividends as I can on the way out.  Not this year, I felt like it was time to get out of most REITs and I did.  So my dividends plummeted in the 2nd Quarter.  

I have recovered nicely in the 3rd Quarter, I also did some trading, selling off several positions after they went ex-dividend and bought  stocks about to go ex-dividend.  

As always, my highest payer was T at over $1200 and my lowest KR at $45.00.  I expect to fall again in the 4th Quarter because I migrated to higher quality but lower paying stocks like MMM and AAPL during the 2nd and 3rd Quarters.  Unless I boost the income through trading.

t3_j389cn,Dividend Investing - Eureka,"Why do we invest in dividend investing?  For some, if not most people, it's to make a passive income stream or to achieve Financial Independence.  That's the goal for me.  

Every month, I would track the dividends I earn and compare it to the previous year.  This is great because on any given day I can look and see how much dividends I earned, and how much dividends I expect to earn for the year.  So, for example, I am projected to earn $254.73 in dividends this year, at the time of this writing.

If I have a goal of earning $500 in dividends per year, or a $1000, I can see how far off I am from that goal.  

**BUT,** another way to track your dividends is to see how much of your expenses dividends can cover on a monthly basis.  For me, this is an extremely motivational way to look at dividend investing.  So, because $254.73 is $21.23 on average, that amount can cover both my Acorns bill ($1 per month) and my HuluPlus bill ($7.99 per month).  That leaves me with $12.24 in dividends to be used for the next bill I am targeting which is Amazon Prime ($14.13 per month).  

In other words, I am $1.89 in dividends away from being able to cover all 3 bills combined.  After I earn enough to target all three bills, I start tracking to see how far off I am from my 4th bill, then 5th bill and so on.  So, using dividends to track how much of your expenses it can cover is hugely motivational and for me it's a Eureka moment.

I am aware of the tax implications of REIT's, I've heard both sides and do want to invest some in REIT's but also diversify more away from it.

t3_j3mfnf,Dividend Yield vs Dividend Growth,"I wanted to ask people’s opinions of looking for yield vs dividend growth. I invest in dividends in a retirement account I have for extra income that I earn. As a result my ability to contribute comes intermittently according to when I get paid for my consulting/speaking work. However, I end up with some lump sums to initiate positions with.
I have made it a practice so far to invest in a reasonably sustainable dividend (lower payout ratios etc) with a good yield ( above 3.5%) so as to make the best use of the money I am putting into the market. However, not all of these securities have a high 10 yr dividend growth rate ( such as VZ that increases dividends a measly 2% yearly) and I am wondering by how much one should balance yield with growth rate. For example would GD at a roughly 3.18% yield but 10% dividend growth rate be a better longer term investment than VZ at 4.2% but lower growth rate.

Would be curious to know how you all factor this in and weigh which stocks you enter into positions on.

Age 28M. Been investing since summer 2015. It's sort of blowing my mind seeing this passive cash flow. Lot of upfront work. Worth it!

I started tracking dividends in 2018.

My investments total around $120,000. I imagine my total yield is around 2%.

My 2020 Projected Dividends Total is if I stopped contributing to everything but my 401K.

My 401K dividends are top heavy in Q4. I'm forecasting $771 in Q4 dividends (401K holdings: FXAIX 80%, FSMDX 10% FSSNX 10%).

In 2020, I stopped contributing to my Rental Down Payment Taxable and Fundrise Account to focus on my Dividend Portfolio Taxable.

My Dividend Portfolio Taxable is 25 individual stocks, fairly equally weighted. 8 stocks for each quarter and 1 monthly payer.

AAPL, ABBV, ACN, AFL, BAC, CMCSA, COST, FRT, GD, GPC, JNJ, JPM, LOW, MA, MMM, MO, MSFT, NKE, O, ROP, SPGI, STOR, T, TSN, V.

Current holdings: 401k with 100% SP500 index w/ employer match and a Roth IRA with 95% VTI and 5% QQQ

My dividend portfolio is in a taxable account - I own a vending business and once student loans are paid off I’m going to max out the Roth IRA and start contributing $6k/yr into the dividend portfolio. As the business grows so will the contributions into this portfolio. I will be able to re-invest into my business and lower my tax burden but at some point with no personal or business debt I am running out of ideas to reduce the tax burden. I only want to grow the business large enough to meet my investing goals. I have a family and don’t want to commit any more time to business than necessary. In my mind I can feed this portfolio a large chunk of my business profits and active income to help create another income stream that I can tap into later in life re-investing dividends until then. I think this portfolio would definitely be more tax efficient as a Roth IRA but I would like to have access to the dividends before retirement age since my other accounts will be off limits until age 59 1/2. If everything continues to go well I shouldn’t need to work until retirement age unless I want to.

With all that being said, how does this portfolio look? My goal is to try to match avg. market gains over a 20yr period but with a higher dividend yield, maybe with a little less volatility. I’ve targeted companies that seem to be growing their dividend consistently with potential still for capital growth. I do realize that REITs weigh in at 25% and I understand the implications of that.

The distributable cash flow per share of the company fell only 12% over the prior year’s quarter, from $0.50 to $0.44. As a result, Kinder Morgan achieved a dividend coverage ratio of 1.68, with its distributable cash flow exceeding its dividend by $404 million.

Numerous companies in the energy sector have cut their dividends this year due to the impact of the pandemic on their business. Kinder Morgan is a bright exception, as it has raised its annual dividend by 5% this year, from $1.00 to $1.05.

Over the last few days I have had to remove a startling number of submissions that violate the subreddit rules.  I know we have a lot of new people, so this is likely the reason for the uptick.

I am taking this opportunity to remind all users to please read the rules before submitting.  Here on r/dividends, we have actual standards when it comes to quality.  Shitposts are not generally liked by this community.  Neither are posts asking us to convince you to invest in dividend paying companies.  Rule 7 explicitly prohibits low-effort posts, and repeated intentional violations of any of the rules are grounds for being banned.

[Here is the unnecessarily detailed explanation of the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/io9hds/an_unnecessarily_detailed_explanation_of_the/).  If you have any additional questions about the rules, do not hesitate to reach out to the mod team (or me specifically, since I am the one who wrote the rules).

Thank you for your participation in r/dividends.

Since then, I've been learning a lot by following this sub as well as the all the related subs and watching a lot of YouTube videos of stocks/investing/dividends/etc. And so far, I've really enjoyed investing in the stock market. It's fun to watch my money grow, and it becomes kind of like a game to find good stocks at any given time.

right now, I have a little over 11k in my account and plan to add about 1,000 a month to it. The markets I feel the strongest about are tech and clean energy, so that's where I've invested most my money so far. I've heard mixed opinions about having so much of your portfolio in only one or two sectors. But I do feel that those markets are both poised for strong growth in the coming years, and as I work in tech, it's an industry I'm very familiar with. My thoughts are that I will invest mostly in these two sectors, but also pick a few other companies in other sectors that I think I good. I think my main issue now is my portfolio isn't diverse at all, I've mainly been buying the same stocks whenever I see that they're at a good price. Any advice about anything would be appreciated.

DGRW has had a superior 5 year total return compared to every other dividend growth ETF except for VIG. The 5 year return difference between VIG and DGRW is about 0.15% per annum.

DGRW has a higher yield than VIG (2.5%) and pays out monthly.

DGRW does have a higher fee, however, at 0.26% since the fund is so actively managed.

I think the monthly dividend payout could allow for faster and more opportunistic compounding which could produce superior long term returns.

In addition, the monthly payout could be attractive to dividend growth investors seeking to some day live off the income from their portfolio.",13,0.84,1602443575.0

Longtime users of the sub may have noticed that the weekends were always a chaotic time for this community moderation wise.  Your reports would often go several hours (or even entire days) without being addressed.  This is because (contrary to popular opinion) I actually have a life.  As a retail manager, my store makes the most money on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  I tend to work 10-12 hour shifts these days, and so have very little time to do anything pertaining to reddit.  Since I am a firm believer in working harder than my employees, r/dividends has had to suck it up and deal with no moderation during these times.

As of five days ago, that has changed.  Today I am officially announcing to the community that I have brought on a new member of the r/dividends mod team.  For the past five days, u/Rasputin_ has been helping moderate posts .  The keen eyed among you may have noticed his custom mod flair appear in threads.  He is from the UK, and his announcement should strike fear in the hearts and minds of those who wish to spam on the weekends.  For Rasputin has been brought on specifically because he seems like an upstanding and fair moderator, and for his strategically open weekend schedule.  He has already banned multiple spammers, and receives my full endorsement for the actions taken so far.

I hope you will join me in wishing Rasputin the best of luck.

Thank you for your participation in r/dividends,

2. Users with technical knowledge capable of programming bots.
3. Anyone with experience investing to help create the Wiki and FAQ for new users that is currently in development.

Users may choose to apply solely to become a moderator, wiki contributor, or both.  All applications will be reviewed and processed by yours truly.

**Users who apply but whose services are not required at this time will be given priority the next time a vacancy in the mod team occurs.**

Some preemptive Questions answered:

Q: Some subreddits prohibit mods from being active in the community.  Does this apply here?

*A: Moderators are encouraged to be active and engage with the community.  You will still be free to post and comment at your leisure.  Same with wiki contributors.*

Q: Are there account age and/or karma requirements?

*A: Accounts must be at least 1 month old and have 100 karma.  All applicants will be processed on a case-by-case basis.*

Q: Do I get a custom flair?

*A: Of course.  All mods and wiki writers will receive a custom flair.*

Q: Didn't you just do one of these two weeks ago?

*A. Yes.  But the subreddit is continuing to grow at a near exponential rate by thousands of users per week.  I want to preemptively expand and build a top-tier mod team in anticipation of the growth.  If current trends continue, the subreddit will reach 100k users within six months, which is too many for 3 active mods to handle.  My other concern is the wiki.  Having just one user work on it is not ideal.  I want to get some community help on the project.*

Q: What would I be responsible for?

*A: That is up to you.  Tell me what you are good at and what you want to do.  If you aren't a robot, I will see what we can do.*

Q: How many people are you looking for?

*A: I am looking for all the wiki contributors I can get.  Mod-wise, it is a rolling target.  As a manager in the real world, I am a big fan of specialization of labor.  So having different people do different things is very appealing to me.  It all depends on interests and what people are good at.*

Q: Should I apply?  I do not know if I should apply.

*A: There is zero harm or risk in submitting an application.  It takes less than 60 seconds and doesn't involve any real effort.*

Q: If I apply, when will I know if I got the job?

*The first round will be completed on Tuesday October 20, 2020. At approximately 12:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  You may submit applications up until 1 hour before the deadline.  Don't wait to apply though. If I have to choose between two equal candidates for a position, the one who applied earlier will be more likely to get the position.*

I am 34 with decent job so I have the normal 401k going on. 
In addition, for any of these ling term investment, should I wait a little to buy for then to drop or should I just buy them since it's a long term investment?

Your help is greatly appreciated!",63,0.96,1602769724.0
t3_jbh0c2,British Petroleum (BP) & Energy Sector Discussion,"Hello r/Dividends, today, I'd like to discuss BP and the energy sector as a whole.

I initiated a small position in BP yesterday. Some may ask, u/DeepHouseGod, why would you initiate a position in a company that's recently cut their dividend and has a terrible balance sheet?

Here's why:

* Even with the dividend cut, I still locked in a starting yield of 7.5%. Even if BP suffers another 50% cut, i'm still looking at a 3.56% starting yield.
* The price of oil is going to recover eventually, and as the USA (and world) eventually reopens completely, oil demand will increase. This will help them pick up pieces from the oil crisis/COVID-19 and help them expand their business or increase dividends.
* Even in their depressed state, their market cap is $56 billion. In a market where smaller fish are being snapped up (see COP looking to buy CXO) or dying out, BP is still well positioned and is a major player.
* The company says it wants to have net-zero emissions by 2050.
* Value stocks in general have been under-preforming growth and this trend won't last forever.
* BP is vertically integrated.
* Operations in 78 countries, so they have excellent geographic diversity.
* They have significant renewable energy exposure (biofuels, wind, smart grid, and solar) and are looking to expand their stakes in renewables to ensure they remain viable.
* They're actively trying to increase their exposure to renewable energy.
* BP owns a 19.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, the largest publicly traded oil company in the world based on hydrocarbon reserves.
* They're finished paying for the 2010 Gulf oil spill.

Additionally, I have no problem buying when there's fear in the oil market. Let's be honest, the oil & gas industry isn't going anywhere, even with the push towards renewables. Will we see even more industry consolidation? Probably. If we want to think of how the major energy companies can expand their businesses and become more viable long term, consider the following:

The oil & gas sector is still significantly larger than the renewable energy sector by market cap. There are many intriguing small cap companies in the renewable sector that would make fantastic acquisition targets for oil giants such as BP in the future. The fact is that many of these oil giants would be better served to simply buy and integrate renewable companies into their existing business than trying to develop tech on their own. This is how I foresee the oil majors remaining relevant into the future as the world's dependence on oil decreases.

I am curious to hear what other dividend investors think about BP, the energy sector as a whole, and the direction it's heading. I think for an industry that's (still) filled with a juicy yields, it warrants a serious discussion.

Happy investing y'all!

t3_jc6x4c,"Trying to make dividend portfolio, any comments welcome","Hi dividend fellows (new here, don't be to hard on me),

I will be investing around 10k to dividend stock during the end of the year. I have another portfolio for acc stocks, and one for funds. I will use dividends from div portfolio to invest to these two other portfolios in monthly basis (Thus, I want stocks with monthly or at least quarterly divs, for investing to funds I have no fees). And I am planning to increase div portfolio to 20k during next spring. 

My goal is to get very high dividend yield with investment spread to different areas. And as FYI for the suggestions, I am not able to buy US dividend ETFs cos of EU regulations in my home country. Only stocks are okay.

I was initially thinking to spread my starting portfolio to these companies 2k each:

*stock (divs) = reason why interested*

**HRZN** (9%) = because it invest to startups, so inherently different to REITs etc.

**TRSWF** (5,29%) = renewables with dividends, take my monies 

(is CWEN (4,21 %) better than TRSWF?)

**ARR** (12,31%) = mREIT, adding some typical mREIT with high yield, price is also low after covid19, but the trust seems to be still breathing. Any comments about their future?

**T** (7,58%) = Aristocrat with some stability

**MAIN** (8,24%) = Capital trust, and also very long track record.

This portfolio would have avg dividend of 8.484 %.

I could also add 1-3 more by reducing the amount I invest to one stock, but I pay around 10 dollars for fees when I buy, so don't wan't my fees go over 1%.

Any suggestions for better picks or comments about companies welcome. Or if you would add something else, it would be welcome also. 

I am also interested in Gladstones: LAND, GOOD, GAIN, GLAD. Any comments about them? :)

Always maintains a non-inflation proof dividend whether it is covered or not and trades within a range for most of its history which, while not inflation-proof, still offers multi-year opportunities for buying the dip.

David Gladstone also operates a couple of BDCs, which I have decided to pass on. And, it offers the LAND ticker, which I find to be extremely interesting considering they own over 800 million dollars' worth of productive land with only about a 300 million market cap.

At any rate, Gladstone has decided to structure his companies as being foremost pro-shareholder for nearly two decades. Might charge high fees internal to NAV or might not. He does seem to be an old school businessman. I really like GOOD and LAND. The man is a leader who was perhaps overshadowed by leaders in technology this century.

Not to sound morbid...

But I'm curious if anyone has any insights as to what would happen if this man passed away.

He seems to hold his companies together, but the man is aging. Are there covenants within his companies to guide future investment? Or would the reputed track histories die with him? If I invested in his companies and he were no longer here, would the companies be stripped for parts or would they be structured as they are to return shareholder value?

However, they aren't really sensitive to oil prices themselves, just the flow / delivery / storage.

Their dividend is at 10+% which appears to be fairly safe as the [cash] payout ratio is 61%, less likely to cut their streak of dividend payout (generally like to see it less than 85-90% so should have some wiggle room) They have access to 7 billion in liquidity as well. 

Lock in 10.4% dividend at its current price, and as the price increases the dividend payout % goes down, but its actually still based on the price you bought it at, so you keep earning 10% just in dividends going forward? As long as the dividend doesn't get cut



consensus price target: 24
low target: 19; high target 29

But they say don't buy an ETF if you wouldn't buy the stocks contained within and I do believe that's accurate. Why would I ever buy stock in H&R Block?

 Here is what I bought with the proceeds:

More O. Price dip looked good and they are excellent stewards of their assets. Hard to think of a more shareholder-focused REIT. Their IG companies will always maintain a store presence. I want a lot more of them at these rates.

More GOOD. One of my only ""buy the dip always"" small cap REITs. Gladstone is a fine businessman who is moving the trust to more industrial holdings. *Trustworthy* is how I describe him. Collects high fees but never, ever lets shareholders down.

BNL. They performed well when they were private and recently IPO'd. Expecting a 6% yield with this diversified trust *with* price increase. I think this sub should look into them more since they're internally managed and are looking to replicate or increase performance from when they were private. Diverse, yet lots of their retail holdings are Taco Bell leases... which hardly ever go out of business.

MPW. A hospital real estate trust. Don't see them going anywhere, though I kept this a small position until I learn more about their financials. Hospital real estate is great, but they seem a little opaque to me.

PDT. A corporate bond fund that has *increased* its NAV since IPO many years ago. High hopes and a complement to the PTY I already own so it balances out the latter's scary high premium.

LAND. A Gladstone REIT that focuses on specialty crop farmland. No real international competition for its crops, its California land wasn't impacted by wildfires, keen on water rights, and returned close to 21% this year. A fine hedge if nothing else which I plan to own *forever.* Real estate worth over 800 million and growing.

ORCC. A BDC that posted no non-accruals this year which a large teacher's pension fund invested in. I'm a bit weary of this sector but I am okay with it. I like ARCC, HTGC, and TSLX, and hold these companies, but posting zero non-accruals in a terrible year quite frankly speaks volumes about their underwriting.

MNR. An old and venerable industrial REIT which is well diversified and perhaps overlooked. Ugly buildings book good returns, my friends.

PGX. A solid preferred shares fund that just about beat SPHD anyway. Wanted to start this for a little while now.

And UTG. A well run CEF focusing on utilities that PDT does not. Biggest holding is NEE, which had a tech-like run up this year.

And there you have it. Of all these investments I am most hopeful for BNL (for its price target though I doubt I would sell) and LAND, which is my first real ""hedge"" investment. And a good hedge it is. Absolutely love owning stock units in a farmland trust that is increasing its holdings in a big way. I can taste the blueberries. Good farmland would be far more worthwhile than gold in an apocalypse after all!

Now that I have most of my watchlist out of the way I feel I can build on these small positions over time. In two years I can't wait to see where things sit. And then five years, and ten.

The only companies remaining on my watchlist are: NNN, HTA, and REG (along with more O and STAG). I expect to start small positions in these this Friday. Then, I will build upwards and compound always.

So I expect to max out an HSA with access to TD Ameritrade stocks and ETFs by mid-February 2021 for 2020 and 2021 ($7150 expected). After this date, I expect my access to the HSA to be gone (adding to the HSA, job contract over). Just a few questions:

1. With a time horizon of ~40 years, is there any benefit of individual stocks (O, HRL, JNJ, T, etc.) over one of these Vanguard ETFs? If I treat the $7150 as a one time initial investment starting February 2021, which would be a better set and forget?

2. Is there any other investment which would clearly outperform these choices (VOO, VTI, etc.)

3. Generally, what is your recommendation/breakdown on holdings in an HSA, Roth IRA, 401k, and taxable brokerage account?

They do publish their top tenants but they have about 2500 properties and I was curious as to why it was hard to find the majority of them. The CEO got back to me this morning on this very question. Thought some here might enjoy his response:

""There is a Schedule 3 that we file annually at the back of the 10-K with a list of locations, though it may not be what you're looking for. Our disclosure is really strong at the portfolio level - credit strats, master leases, coverages, credit loss walks, etc. We try to connect the dots for you regarding performance. And this is precisely the kind of data our board wants to see - and also me as CEO. As you get into individual addresses, there is literally no valid conclusion you could ever arrive at with respect to portfolio quality. I would call such disclosure a data dump....but of no informative value. And there is a lot of this kind of thing in REITland. For instance, we provide data on sector and industry exposure and provide square footage data, so you can effectively compute the rent per square foot of our limited service restaurants. Let's say, you'd like to compare that to other net lease peers. You cant! No one else discloses this. Even then, were we to hand our location data, you'd have no clue as to the store coverages...and whether the locations were in master leases or not or whether we have credit enhancements- this is crucial data. You'd have no idea, unless we were to disclose it, how much we spent for a property. And you'd generally have no idea of the underlying tenant credit quality. All you might be able to do is to make a high level determination as to whether you like the real estate. Of course, you may not like the real estate...and may wonder why we bought it. But you might like it better if you knew the price or knew what other real estate we bundled the lease with! Anyway, that's why we stick with contract and portfolio disclosure. Plus, since we do so much through direct origination, were we to provide a list of tenants, our peers would simply start to call on them. That is what happens every time a tenant of ours ends up in our top ten list. For instance, we bought a lot of National Veterinary Associates clinics several years ago at cap rates in the 8 and up range. After they got on our list, the rates fell into the low sevens and today they can trade for rates in the mid sixes. We want to avoid repeats like this where possible!

t3_jj4tdw,Does this make as much sense as I think,"Im 29yo, max my roth every year and have been transitioning to also having more of a stock portfolio instead of continually adding past emergency fund in savings i know a lot of advice is situational so thats why im adding this intro. 

Okay so Ive been putting more money into the market and this month will be putting 5k in and generally for months leading forward will be putting an average of 1-3k in. 

Does it make sense to buy 100 shares of KO then sell semi far OTM covered calls to add (albeit small) weekly additional income to increase monthly income to continue diversifying. The way im looking at it is i can weekly sell an 85+% profit in a covered call and use the premium to add to shares or work towards having 100 shares of pep , O, or visa. 

Understanding the growth potential etc of other companies. I obviously can continue keeping things generally even, but as a long term holder not sure if it matters here at the “beginning” but am looking at this from a perspective of i know KO ist going to increase at xx% in the next 5 years.

t3_jjz2uy,Looking for detailed opinions on KBWY for income.,"So, I've been looking into this one for a while.  As I understand it, the risks are mostly dividend volatility as well as price volatility, both of which can be significant at times.  However, even given the recent cuts, it is still yielding 8% on my cost basis.  Given my means and lifestyle, I can relatively quickly achieve financial independence with this holding and that is a big priority of mine.  This ETF seems to be the safest play on high-yield that I can find.  I plan to add to this position continuously while it's at a discount and afterward funnel the rest of my funds into more dividend growth style securities, as well as staples like VOO.   I can stomach the price as well as the dividend volatility of this ETF and hold through the downs.  But what I'm wondering is if there's anything I may be missing here, risks I may have missed, or even if there is a better play on income.

I like QYLD but suspect it will trend downward by its very nature in the long term, whereas these other two funds have a good history and are essentially bonds rather than options. That said, the stability of these CEFs isn't what it looks like since even if the price is similar to when they started, they started years ago so inflation has eaten up some real returns rather than nominal. But the benefit of them lies in how easy it is to see historical NAV. In the case of PDT, NAV has increased. I'm unsure of how to chart the NAV of QYLD.

Most of QYLD's troubles seem easy to place historically, however. Its 2018 drop coincided with increasing tensions in the administration's trade war (many investments dropped) and of course covid this year. 

I know there was a recent post on QYLD. But I'm curious if anyone would prefer it to these CEFs or vice versa, and if it's likely QYLD could eventually face some price appreciation rather than degradation given its basis in high percentage buy-write options.",5,1.0,1604013613.0
t3_jkk5oh,My Complete Guide to Dividend Investing,"**Where to Start?**

* ""Get Rich with Dividends"" is a great book that provides a foundational understanding of Dividend investing. The pdf can be found here: [http://psulibrary.palawan.edu.ph/wtbooks/resources/pdf/908250.pdf](http://psulibrary.palawan.edu.ph/wtbooks/resources/pdf/908250.pdf)
   * It is around 200 pages but is a very easy and informational read. Even if you are familiar with dividend investing, it can be useful to read up on certain chapters that you are unfamiliar with
* There are basic ideas fundamental to dividend investing
   * Dividend Compounding/Reinvesting, Dividend Yield, Dividend Growth, Payout Ratio
   * Dividend Company Categorization: Dividend Champions, Dividend Contenders, etc. 
   * Dividend ETF's: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp)
   * Drip Investing: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp)

**How to Pick Dividend Stocks?**

*  Spreadsheet of dividend paying companies along with key metrics 
   * [https://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp](https://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp) 
      * Since the users are international, this tool does have dividend data for Canada, Europe, Eurozone, and UK
      * The only downside of this tool is that it is updated monthly. Therefore, I would recommend using it to find dividend stocks you are interested in and to put them on your watch-list.
      *  I created a website that collects the same data as dripinvesting but uses an API to update daily. Due to self promotion rule, please feel free to pm for a link. The tool below is similar but less detailed.
* Dividend Screener Tool
   * [https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/screener/](https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/screener/)
   * Has several important metrics but not as comprehensive as the spreadsheet above
* Checking historical performance
   * [http://www.tickertech.com/cgi/returns.mpl?symbol=O&smonth=01&sday=01&syear=1995&emonth=10&eday=29&eyear=2020&compareto=SPY&other=](http://www.tickertech.com/cgi/returns.mpl?symbol=O&smonth=01&sday=01&syear=1995&emonth=10&eday=29&eyear=2020&compareto=SPY&other=)
   * I especially like this tool because you can compare the value of an investment in a stock over time with dividends reinvested
* Understanding your own personal goals
   * This is honestly one of the most important things in my opinion. Depending on your goals and timeline, the metrics you value will vary. With that said, you must acknowledge that dividend investing is a long term investing strategy. Compounding takes years and requires reinvesting dividends. You can use this tool to determine what kind of dividend yield and compounding you would need to reach your goal: [https://www.dividend-calculator.com/monthly.php](https://www.dividend-calculator.com/monthly.php)

**Tracking Your Dividends**

* DivTracker (app, free): Tracks your portfolio value, yield on market, yield on cost, yearly income, cost basis, and has several cool features. Contains a calendar with dividend payouts and displays the dividends you are expected to receive in the year. The cooler features are not free, however. 
* The Rich (app, free): Similar to DivTracker for the most part and has a nice UI
* There are definitely more tools out there that maybe other users can add. Regardless, tracking your dividends is important to make sure that you are meeting your goals and to keep you motivated

**Brokerage** 

* I don't really have a preference but below is a list of brokerages that support fractional shared and DRIP as that might be important to some investors
* M1, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, E Trade

**Options** 

* Selling Puts: [https://www.lynalden.com/selling-put-options/](https://www.lynalden.com/selling-put-options/)
* Covered Calls: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/rookies-corner/writing-covered-calls/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/rookies-corner/writing-covered-calls/)
* The strategy is often referred to as the wheel: [https://optionstradingiq.com/the-wheel-strategy/](https://optionstradingiq.com/the-wheel-strategy/)
* Here is a very comprehensive book to options: [http://terredegaia.free.fr/ppics/Trading/Mcgraw-Hill%20-%20Option%20Pricing%20And%20Volatility%20-%20Advanced%20Strategies%20And%20Trading%20Techniques%20-%20Sheldon%20Natenberg%20-%20(1994).pdf](http://terredegaia.free.fr/ppics/Trading/Mcgraw-Hill%20-%20Option%20Pricing%20And%20Volatility%20-%20Advanced%20Strategies%20And%20Trading%20Techniques%20-%20Sheldon%20Natenberg%20-%20(1994).pdf)
   * It is over 400 pages, so I would advise reading it if you are very interested or you want to read specific subsections relevant to dividend investing 
* Options are definitely not necessary to succeed as a dividend investor. If done correctly, it can provide benefits such as lowering your cost basis.  There is obviously risk involved and requires a more hands on approach than simply buying stocks. 

**Tax**

* This is an important point to consider. Given that the audience is international, it is probably in the best interest for you to do your own research. Understanding how dividends are taxed obviously increases the amount of money you receive from dividends

**My Personal Tips**

* Dividend investing is a long term strategy and requires reinvesting dividends for maximum potential 
* I see a lot of people focused simply on dividend yield, and I would advise caution against it. The consistency of dividends and a growing dividend is key to amazing returns. Therefore, payout ratio, number of consecutive years of growing dividends payed, and dividend growth rate should be at the top of your list when screening stocks alongside dividend yield. 
   * When evaluating a company, don't just think about how much they will pay you today but whether or not they will be able to continuously increase how much they pay you for years to come.
* If you have a strong understanding of dividend investing fundamentals, I would recommend investing in individual stocks rather than ETF's. Your portfolio is essentially your personal ETF without the fees associated. With that said, ETF's can be a great starting point for beginners and it's always a good idea to research the stocks that make up any individual ETF. 
* Dividend investing can be a really hands off and stress free investing strategy if done correctly. The reason I am so passionate about dividend investing is because I feel that my money is working for me without much work from me. I put in a lot of time upfront to make initial investments but now I primarily just reap the benefits of it. I hope that I can share this appreciation for dividend investing to the community here and beyond.",421,0.99,1604009922.0

t3_jkeqbc,New Investor. Advice is welcome,"Hey guys!

Am new to reddit and to trading. My mom made me read multiple books on investing for my future, and overall, all the books had a main idea of consistently paying yourself by putting money into a portfolio that pays out dividends. So I invested in a few companies that I thought looked good for the long run. I am planning on keeping this account for decades, therefore I am essentially a long-term dividend income investor? The goal is for my to have an income from my dividends that will make me comfortable. It is a TFSA account. I will write my Questrade portfolio percentages down below. About 3k invested so far, another 1k in the account I will use to buy more new (maybe) stocks in the next few weeks. Then just some more monthly additions to already bought stocks. Any help, advice, recommendations or suggestions for purchases/selling is greatly appreciated!

By the power vested in me, I hereby initiate a challenge. Read carefully, as I will only mention this once.

As many of you know, one of the first things a new user does when they go on a new subreddit is to look at the top posts of all time. However, unfortunately our top posts were created back in the days before active moderation.  They sit as an open contradiction to what this sub stands for. It gives every single new user the exact opposite idea of what this community is. 

Therefore, I am issuing a challenge to this community. Create a post that dethrones this subreddit's top post of all time!

It currently sits at +433.  You may do whatever it takes to dethrone the top post (including downvoting the top post to make your job easier).  Post, upvote, award. You know the rest.  But it must be within our subreddit rules. 

If every single person who visited this sub upvoted the most recent post, then this would be done in less than 24 hours.

I'm not sure what the reward will be. I will need to talk amongst the mod team. I am open to community feedback as well on this. 

I believe in you r/dividends.

t3_jl4uwv,Opinion on Federal Realty Investment Trust ticker $FRT,"Hello guys, these dips are giving us a great chance to invest on companies with quality and i was just checking out some safe-dividend picks. Thus, Federal Realty Investment Trust ($FRT) showed up. It states that it handles high-quality retail-based properties primarily in major coastal markets. From what i see:

Pros:

* Div Yield of 6.12%
* Almost guaranteed Dividend with 92.24% Payout Ratio
* Growing Dividend per year (5 year growth rate 4.64%)+
* Dividend Growth for 52 years

&#x200B;

Cons:

* Stock Price has been kinda stagnant with no real growth or decline during the Pre-Corona times
* Corona dropped it even further and the stock is struggling ever since.
* Dividend Cutting Risk is substantial due to reduced profits. I'm going to quote  Mizuho Securities USA analyst Haendel St. Juste here:  ""given its lagging rent collections, occupancy decline/lack of pricing power concerns, and a rather high 112% 2021 AFFO coverage, implying modest dividend reduction risk we can't ignore.""

t3_jlmpjo,"$LHX, $RTX, $LMT and the Defense Industry DD","**PREFACE:**

&#x200B;

I think this upcoming week will provide a fantastic opportunity to enter an investment into any of the three tickers I listed at a tremendous discount to fair value. 

Election uncertainties and fears of a Biden win have caused the share prices of defense sector stocks plummet despite strong financial results in the most recent round of earnings.

The outlook for the defense budget is actually great. Both Biden and Trump would be **extremely unlikely** to significantly cut the defense budget. Both have formally stated that they would like to maintain a strong military presence to counter the rising threat of China albeit through different strategies. Biden wants more defense spending to be allocated towards cybersecurity/drones while trump wants more conventional options.

&#x200B;

**Dividend Analysis:**

All three of the companies have respectable dividend safety and growth histories. Right now $RTX is the most undervalued due to the headwinds from its acquisition of UTX and the stagnation of revenue streams related to aviation/planes until global air travel recovers.

$LHX has the absolute highest CAGR of \~20% over the past 20 years with a solid 5 year DGR of 10%. 

$LMT is not too far behind $LHX with a 5 year DGR of \~8%

$LMT offers a slightly higher starting yield at \~2.7% compared to $LHX at 2.1% though nowhere nearly as high as $RTX at 3.5%

**Fundamental Analysis:**

$LMT is likely the safest bet here. It has the largest defense backlog and is trading at a lower PE ratio relative to LHX. It also doesn't face the headwinds of exposure to the aviation industry like $RTX.

$LHX offers the biggest potential for future growth. These guys are trading at a large P/E for a reason; they've been experiencing explosive growth and are in drones + cybersecurity services which are likely to boom.

$RTX is a deep value/recovery play.",56,0.95,1604166442.0

\#stocks	Payed

AT & T	                17.58	500

Unum Group	133.58	2500

Abbvie	                  5.94	500

So, a total of 3,500 USD invested which will add 158.63 USD to the yearly income after withholding tax. AT & T needs no introduction in this community, since a lot have already been posted in here.

The story is quite different with Unum Group. I haven't seen any one talking about it here.  
 

When I look to the fundamentals for Unum they look really appealing to me a P/E below 4 and P/Bookvalue of 0.34, the one thing that concerns me about the them is that the profit margin has seen a small decline, but overall they look undervalued to me from a fundamentals perspective.

t3_jpyht6,ETF Diversification Arguments - Why Weighting Matters More Than Holdings - QQQ," 

# Introduction:

This will be a short post regarding the weighting of individual securities in an ETF and taking the implications of that into consideration. ETFs can often be associated with security due to their large number of holdings, it is seen as an indicator for reduced risk, but something that needs to be considered more is this - are all your holdings being weighed equally, why/why not?

This is especially important for dividend ETF investors. You need to be aware of the individual holdings in an ETF you invest into because not all companies are made equal. Some are really great, and some are terrible. For Dividend Growth investing looking for the stable, and valuable companies is especially important.

# Weighting Matters and How It Will Increase/Decrease Your Risk Exposure:

An important consideration is that the ""diverse"" ETFs or funds may not be as diversified as you think when the weightings of individual securities are taken into account. Let's take a very popular ETF as an example: QQQ.

QQQ is very popular market-cap-weighted (larger companies are given more weight more than smaller ones) tracking the NASDAQ 100 index. Because of this weighting system, the top 8 of the stocks in QQQ have a much more significant impact to the growth or decline of the ETF than the other 92! Technology stocks alone make up over 50% of QQQ, so how diversified are you really when over 50% of your potential portfolio is dependent on how well the largest 8 tech companies are doing?

The way to minimize your risk to one particular sector or from ETFs that are overweight on several stocks would be to simply search for equal-weight funds (funds that give equal weighting to large/smaller companies), or funds that are simply more broadly diversified than the NASDAQ-100. However be aware there are also plenty of arguments against these funds. For example, you limit your upsides potential, or you give more weight to potential bad apples since all companies are not created equal.

Regardless the point here is, if you are looking for diversification/security, then, the most important thing is exposure to different sectors so that your portfolio isn't subject to the exact same risks. (Tech / Oil / Subway) Not all market sectors move in tandem, the tech sector has done incredibly well over the past year, however, it is dangerous to take that and project it forward into the future. It was this exact thinking that led to the 2000 tech bubble.

# Final Thoughts:

**This is not an argument against owning QQQ (or any similar ETFs), it simply a post regarding to how the weighting of stocks in a fund can affect performance and sector exposure.** Take your risk tolerance into account, are you fine with a large percentage of your portfolio being dedicated to tech, or some other sector? If yeah then have at it, but always do you research. If not, then more broadly diversified funds like SPY or VTI will be more your friend. For dividend investing the goals of NOBL vs SCHD, as well as their individual holdings/market weightings, are very important to consider. 

There are many sites that break down the goals of ETFs and their individual holdings + weightings of those holdings. Research your funds to ensure they line up with your diversification or consolidation goals.

Thanks for reading guys, if anyone has good researching recommendations or favorite ETFs to recommend then please comment. And have a good day! (or don't if you don't want to, I'm not your mom, I can't tell you what to do)",47,0.94,1604783687.0

t3_jqd4dz,Do cumulative preferred shares accumulate dividends on the share or the owner?,"REITs commonly issue preferred shares that pay cumulative dividends: If they suspend dividends for one quarter, they're backlogged and have to be paid later before common shareholders get any dividends or they call the preferred shares back. Many people sell off their shares, the stock price drops, and the yield becomes very high.

My question: Can you invest in preferred shares with backlogged dividends and get a double or triple payment down the road when the company recovers, in addition to the stock price restoring to its original yield? Or do these owners-of-record that sell off still claim those dividends many months after they sold the stock, when the company eventually pays them?

For strategy: I'm thinking about keeping a fixed ratio of common/preferred shares for REITs that I own, so if there is bad news I would sell my preferred shares and buy common stock, and with good news sell common stock and buy preferred shares. Preferred stock drops less on bad news, so this lets me ""double-down"" on falling stock prices without actually putting more money in.",4,0.84,1604847881.0

Recently I created a new logo for the subreddit to replace the ripoff temporary logo we were using before.  I will be openly transparent with how it was created:

In the moderator's toolbox we are able to customize the logo of the subreddit.  Reddit gives several ""default"" options a community may use in place of the standard Saturn and rings.  I took one of those defaults and took it into a program called [paint.net](https://paint.net) (I refer to it as photoshop because I am an old man when it comes to graphic design technology) and modified the colors to make the logo blue.  Why blue?  The OGs in this community remember I held a poll several months back regarding what the official subreddit color should be.  Blue won.  So hence the blue.

Please feel free to leave any feedback regarding the logo in this thread.  If the response is negative, a moderator other than myself ( u/hapos ) who actually understands graphic design will make a better logo.

Edit: there will be additional customizations rolling out in the near future. The plan is to completely customize the subreddit away from the defaults. If you have any suggestions for what we should prioritize, please let us mods know here.  This will not impact content moderation in any way. Specialization of labor is an amazing invention.

t3_js2apj,Dividend Growth Investing - An Updated In-Depth Guide + Breakdown (November 2020),"# Introduction

Hello everyone! This will be an updated post and in-depth breakdown for the Dividend Growth strategy. It is important to understand how companies need to be evaluated differently based on the investment philosophy you are pursuing. Now, investing in a dividend growth strategy takes time and patience, depending on your income goal, it can take awhile before a dividend portfolio can fully support enough cash flow to sustain your lifestyle without you needing to rely on a full-time or part-time job. But that is the exciting part, once you have enough income from the dividends you can retire or work a job that you perhaps find more exciting?

# The Strategy:

The dividend growth strategy is focused on building up a portfolio of high quality companies that not only pay out a dividend, but have regularly been increasing the dividend payout. The end goal is to create passive income to live off the increasing dividend payouts. So the focus is placed more on the cash flow for wealth rather than the stock appreciation (appreciation is just an added bonus).

NOTE: **Dividend yield is not main focus.** A common misconception is that a very high dividend yield is the most important measure, however, a yield that is considerably higher similar stocks in the same industry may indicate not a good dividend but rather a depressed price due to company issues. This price may signal an eventual dividend cut or elimination if the situation continues. Most dividend ETFs will filter out the top percentage of dividends yields for this reason.

The strategy here is on the **dividend growth**. If a company increases their payout overtime it is going to have an insane snowball effect when the dividends are reinvested (kinda like the snowball effect for paying off debt). Dividend growth investing uses the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends into the same investment to increase your future dividend payments. With each reinvestment, your shares grow slightly larger. With slightly more shares, your next dividend payment is slightly larger. With enough time invested in solid companies, the growth effect is amazing. This is why dividend growers are so important, they add more fuel to this compounding effect!

If you really want to see this effect visualized, check out the charts for Warren Buffets wealth. In 2018 alone, Berkshire raked in **$3.8 billion** in dividends – “a sum that will increase in 2019,” Buffett said in the annual letter. The great majority of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are dividend stocks. And many of those stock are growing their dividend.

# Evaluating Companies for this Strategy:

Since the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:

* Dividend payout ratio:
   * Dividend payouts less than 50%-75% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable.
   * Does the company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term?
* Dividend Yield:
   * Ensure the company is paying a dividend and that the dividend yield isn't too low to start.
   * Watch out for dividend traps! Extremely high dividend yield for non-REITs can often signal an unsustainable payout! Look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (Do research after this ofcourse, this doesn't immediately mean it is healthy)
* Dividend Growth Rate
   * Look for companies that increase their dividend payout year after year.
* Free Cash Flow to Equity:
   * This is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. If a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.
* Debt to EBITDA ratio (Earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)
   * A company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. See AT&T vs Verizon!

NOTE: The companies are often broken into these categories based on how long they have increased their dividend:

* Challenger: 5+ years
* Contender: 10-24 years
* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years
* King: 50+ years

There are ofcourse many other factors. Consider the business, does it have a sustainable model (Coca-Cola & Pepsi)? Is its market shrinking (See oil companies)? Do you like the company and management?? For this type of investing (any type really), you need to know what you are investing into!

# Where to Start and Key Things:

Many of the companies that should be looked for are ones we all recognize because they are so well established and have very wide market exposure. They have incredible staying power for these reasons, and very often have enough money to expand into new markets to remain relevant. This is their significant advantage over startups (many of which they just buy up anyways)

Let's take PEPSI for example. Pepsico (NYSE: PEP) is a company in the Consumer Defensive Sector, its wide variety of iconic brands and products give it a very large global moat.

* Current Dividend Ratio:  2.89% (November 2020 based on share price of $141.75)
* Current Annual Dividend Payout:  $4.09
* Average 3 Year Dividend Growth Rate -  **8.60%**

Looking at this we can see that PEPSI is not only paying a very nice dividend, but it is increasing it at an average of 8%! So even if you don't buy more shares of the stock it will start to pay you more each year just for holding it. The next step from here would be to look into the financials. Essenitally we are just checking to ensure they are not burdened with too much debt, have sharply decreasing revenue, or payouts that exceed their current cashflow.

Other companies that would be good examples (just a few)

* AAPL - Apple - Challenger - IT
* MSFT - Microsoft - Contender - IT
* JPM - JPMorgan Chase - Challenger - Financial
* VZ - Verizon - Contender - Telecommunications
* JNJ - Johnson and Johnson - King - Healthcare
* MMM - 3M - King - Industrials
* IBM - International Business Machines - Aristocrat - IT
* KO - Coca-Cola - King - Consumer Defensive

ETFs are an excellent option, however due the large difference in strategies amoung them they will have to be discussed in a separate post. However some notable ones include: NOBL, SCHD, VYM, VIG, DGRO, and DRGW. (Amoung many many others)

# Advantages and Disadvantages of this Strategy:

Disadvantages:

* Dividends are not always guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends due to financial pressure. At any moment, companies can decrease their dividend payout or completely get rid of it. **However, many of the companies on the Dividends list maintained and increased their dividends during this time, this highlights the importance of investing in quality companies.**
* Unless you are holding these stocks in an IRA you will pay taxes on them.
* When compared to index investing it decreases diversification since you're really only invested into more “large cap” stocks. You'll be missing out on the mid-cap and small-cap stocks
* Some say dividend payouts of the sign of a dying company. For some perhaps this is true, however a strong counter argument is this. If a company is well established and the payout for moving into a new market sector, or a new acquisition wouldn't be favorable, a company can instead payout dividends to entice investors rather than potentially sacrifice company value just in the name of potential growth.
* You have to pay more attention to the companies you are investing into to ensure they remain healthy and can continue to grow and increase their dividend.

Advantages:

* **Reinvesting dividends during sideways moving markets, bear markets, and corrections, purchase more shares with the dividend while the prices are lower. Later, when prices recover, the return is actually enhanced by the temporary fall in the stock price. Reinvesting dividends and accumulating more shares during corrections and bear markets greatly boosts dividend growth investing returns in the long run. This is a significant advantage of dividend stocks over growth stocks in less than ideal market conditions.**
* Historically dividends have provided 43% of the S&P 500 total return from 1930 - 2017 (according to Blackrock). Dividends provide an ongoing return while waiting for capital appreciation.
* The snowball effect of dividend growth compounding can provide competitive returns regardless of whether the price of the stock increases in value or not.
* Creating passive income and preserving capital. Like all stocks they are an excellent hedge against inflation.

# Performance & Final Thoughts:

It depends on what timeframe you are looking at, if say we take from December 1999 - 2017 the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.37% per year. But if we take other timeframes then the S&P500 is dominant. Beating the S&P500 over the long term is near impossible, but **beating the S&P isn't the goal of this strategy**. This strategy is focused on passive income generation. Imagine if checks were rolling in every week during the COVID lockdowns even if you weren't working?

Please supplement this post with your own research. Compare this strategy to general index investing and growth investing. Find what is right for you.

The hope is this post provided insight into this strategy and evaluating dividend paying companies.

t3_js0x5p,Officially unveiling the Moderator's Collection,"Good evening r/dividends,

I am pleased to announce the official unveiling of the latest random idea I thought up.  It is called the ""Moderator's Collection.""

**What is the moderator's collection?**

All moderators on r/dividends have the ability to modify post flair (now).  Basicially the way this works is quite simple.  I have utilized reddit's Collection feature to create a collection.   If a moderator sees a post that they really like, they add it to the collection.

**What types of posts are added?**

I leave that entirely up to moderator discretion.  However, I will tell this community the kinds of posts I intend to add (this will likely give you an idea of what other mods will add.

I personally intend to add posts where I personally feel upvoting is not enough, where commenting is not enough.  If I would give the post a community award, I will likely add it to the collection.  My thought process is that if I were a new user, what would be the best post for me to see to convince me that r/dividends is a truly great community.  Those are the kinds of posts I will be adding.  I am not a mind reader, but I expect other mods to follow similar guidelines.  **I will not exercise any form of control over which posts my fellow moderators choose to include in the collection.**

The other mods are free to tell you what they are looking for.  **They are free to not tell you what they are looking for.  They are under no obligation to tell you anything about how they judge posts**.  Though I will tell you this.  One of the fastest ways to get blocked from posting on r/dividends is to ask a mod to add your post to this collection.  Automoderator will be programmed to block any post that requests entry into the moderator's collection.  Direct messaging a mod trying to lobby for your post will get you banned.  I will have no lobbying on this subreddit.

**Where can I find this collection?**

Great question.  I have given you an absolute boatload of places to find the collection.  Here they are:

1. On the subreddit sidebar, directly underneath the description in the box area labeled ""New to Dividends? Start here.""
2. At the top of the subreddit in the menu tabs area, next to the button titled ""Contact the Moderators""
3. This direct hyperlink [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/collection/db6ca5d5-a950-431f-a7d8-eb4df8e573a1).
4. For those of you who browse reddit from a device or third party app that does not support collections.  Do not worry.  I was already thinking of you.  Hence why a flair exists.  This flair is locked to only mod access, so users are incapable of applying it themselves.  You are able to go on the sidebar and find the Moderator's collection in the list of browsable flairs.

We here at r/dividends care about the user experience very much, so if I need to come up with some other way you can access the collection, let me know.

**How do mods add posts?**

Really simple.

Step 1: They modify the post flair to be ""Moderator's Collection""

Step 2: They hit the button they have access to allowing them to add the post to the collection.

Step 3: They create a comment notifying the OP and the community that they personally selected this post  to be part of the collection.  The moderator may choose whether or not to explain why they picked the post.  It is entirely at their discretion.  Don't ask them about it if they do not tell you.  Though they do not have to comment if they do not want to.

Step 4: They distinguish the comment as Moderator and Sticky it in place of the Automod default message.

**When did you tell the mods about this?**

I actually did not tell any of the moderators about this in advance because I thought of this 15 minutes ago and I do not like waiting around for things.  My bad guys ( u/finance_student, u/Rasputin_, u/SouthernCriticism, u/hapos, and u/FPS_Yusuf1999).

**Anything else I need to know?**

You should follow the collection if you want to see when posts are added to it.  If you like a post and want it in the collection, the best thing you can do for it is to upvote it, comment on it, and to give it an award.  We mods are humans, and we can be persuaded indirectly.",15,0.84,1605067228.0
t3_jrz6n8,Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) - A Stock Analysis,"# Introduction: 

This will be a quick post looking into Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) and why it could be a solid conclusion in a dividend growth portfolio. This company needs no introduction itself, we are all aware they make toothpaste, but some of the other brands under their company name might be surprising.   It specializes in the production, distribution and provision of household, health care, personal care and veterinary products.

# Colgate-Palmolive Dividend History, Payout, and Financials:

The company has paid a out dividend since 1895 and increased its dividend for over 57 consecutive years; qualifying the company as a Dividend King.

(For Reference)

* Challenger: 5+ years
* Contender: 10-24 years
* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years
* King: 50+ years

Current Annual Dividend: $1.76 

Earnings (Current as of November):

* Normalized Earnings Per Share: $2.99
* Cash Flow From Operations (CFO) Per Share:  $4.28
* Free Cash Flow Per Share:  $3.88 
* P/E Ratio -  26.61 
* Net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.4 (This is very healthy)

From this it can be concluded that the company is very stable, it has solid earnings, and the dividend is safe. 

# Does the company have a wide market?

Yes. They own many different brands, as it was mentioned above. In addition to oral care, they produce shampoos, shower gels, deodorants, and home care products.

It also owns specialty/medicinal pet food maker Hill’s, which sells its products through veterinarians and specialty pet retailers.

CL's products are sold in over 200 countries with international sales accounting for \~70% of sales.

It owns Ajax (Francis...Deadpool anyone?)

# Final Thoughts:

Yep, Colgate-Palmolive is about as exciting as toothpaste, but it is a quality company with solid financials and incredible staying power due to its wide product line and brands. The company is a dividend grower and is considered to be a consumer defensive stock, it would make an excellent addition to any dividend growth portfolio if it hasn't already been considered.

t3_jspay5,Dividend ETFs - NOBL - A Quick Guide/Review,"# Introduction:

Hello, as time allows I'll be posts for some of the popular Dividend ETFs on this sub. Tonight will be starting with...

# NOBL -  ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF:

The strategy of this fund is to track an equal-weighted index of S&P 500 companies that have increased dividend payments annually for at least 25 years. Since it is equal-weighting, the individual holdings will compromise usually no more than 1.8%-2.5% of the total portfolio after each quarterly rebalance. (Fluctuates with the number of holdings) Holdings must also meet a $3 Billion market cap and liquidity requirements to be considered. 

* Tracks: S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index
* Yield: 1.28% (11 November 2020)
* Expense Ratio: 0.35%
* Payout: Quarterly
* Total Number of Holdings: 65 (Higher than most similar ETFs)

# Dividend History: 

There has been an overall upward trend with the dividend payout overall, however, there have been several notable downticks over several quarters in the past few years. This will be shown in the table below. (Just 2 years...)  


|Dividend Date|Dividend Payout|
|:-|:-|
|20 March 2019|$0.24|
|25 June 2019|$0.38|
|25 September 2019|$0.36|
|24 December 2019|$0.44|
|25 March 2020|$0.34|
|24 June 2020|$0.41|

# Sector Weightings (November 2020):

*  Industrials - 24.34%
* Consumer Staples - 19.69%
* Materials - 12.63%
* Financials - 10.75%
* Health Care - 9.41%
* Consumer Discretionary - 8.60%
* Real Estate - 5.08%
* Energy - 3.26%
* Utilities - 3.00%
* Information Technology - 1.70%
* Communication Services - 1.53% 

Here we can see the fund is particularly weighted in Industrials and Consumer Staples while having very low weight in Information Technology and Communication Services. This is understandable since Tech companies are much newer and have not had the opportunity to grow their dividends for 25+ years. We could eventually see them added to the fund in the future. As for Financials and Communications Services, well 2008 saw a lot of these companies slashing dividends, so they were eliminated from the fund as a result. 

# Advantages, Disadvantages & 5-yr Performance:

Advantages: 

* Quality Holdings - Composed only of companies with 25+ years of dividend growth
* More holdings than many similar ETFs
* More exposure to mid-cap companies
* Lower Volatility
* Has historical periods of outperforming the S&P500 (If we include the 2000 dotcom bubble so kinda cheating)

Disadvantages: 

* Sector weightings can causes cyclical periods of underperformance due to Industrials exposure
* Due to the filtering strategy is has many older companies in its holdings
* Expense Ratio of 0.35% is high for a passive index ETF

Performance: (As of November, this is very likely to change)

|1 Year|3 Year|5 Year|
|:-|:-|:-|
|6.42%|10.31%|11.43%|

# Takeaways and Final Thoughts:

Overall it is a quality ETF with a decent track record, an overall increasing dividend, and safer holdings. It is has some significant disparities in its sector weightings, but those can always be filled with other ETFs or quality individual stocks until they are eventually added to the fund. 

For dividend growth investors the yield on this ETF is a bit low and there is a lot of fluctuation in the payout amounts. Please note that if you are considering this ETF.

This was just a quick review, so please supplement this with your own research. The individual holdings were not discussed simply because there were too many of them for this post. Thankyou for taking the time to read, hopefully some found this helpful. And have a good night.",64,0.97,1605160279.0

I'm new to the whole dividend scene and I've been considering investing into high dividend companies.  Am I calculating this properly?

EX: Microsoft, price $216.52, div yield=%1.03

Lets say I have 10 stocks in Microsoft...

$216.52 x 10 = $2165.20

(2165.20 \* .0103) = $22.30 (yearly dividend yields)

&#x200B;

If this is a monthly dividend yield we could do this correct?  $22.30 / 12 = $1.85

t3_jt8it2,$BSTZ Dividends on No-Dividend TECH Stocks,"$BSTZ is a CEF (closed-end fund) which holds a portfolio consisting of some pretty high-growth tech stocks like Tesla, Shopify, Square, etc. The CEF sells covered calls on a certain % of their holdings on these tech stocks and distributes this in the form of a monthly dividend.

Current yield is an eye-popping 5%. Best part is that the CEF has had 44% increase in share price this year-alone

Now here's the real kicker: **$BSTZ is trading at a DISCOUNT TO ITS NAV DESPITE MASSIVE OUTPERFORMANCE**

A discount to NAV means that if the fund liquidated everything it held and distributed it back to shareholders, the value of those returns per share would be greater than the current share price.

**Before you say $BSTZ is a new fund and has no history look at $BST**

$BST follows an extremely similar investing philosophy to $BSTZ but with some different tech companies. $BST has been around for years but unlike $BSTZ **$BST TRADES AT A PREMIUM TO NAV AND IS LESS ATTRACTIVE AS AN INVESTMENT.**

t3_ju6nki,Dividend ETFs - DGRW - A Quick Guide/Review,"# Introduction:

Hello everyone, today I'll quickly be covering a popular monthly paying ETF - DGRW

# DGRW -  WisdomTree US Quality Dividend Growth Fund:

The strategy of this ETF is unique, it focuses on potential for dividend growth as opposed to backward-looking dividend increases, investing in large/midcap dividend-paying stocks with stronger growth characteristics.  It's methodology is to compare the forward-looking earnings estimates with historical Return on Assets and Return on Equity growth in its selection process. Additionally this ETF does contain REITs, holding companies, and some ADRs.

The fund aims to limit the weighting of its holdings to 5%, however it is only rebalanced once a year in December, so there can be some fluctuations. The index is also weighted by dividends and not market capitalization. 

*  TracksWisdomTree US Dividend Growth Index 
* Yield: 2.17% (14 November 2020)
* Expense Ratio: 0.28%
* Payout: Monthly
* Total Number of Holdings: 266

# Dividend History:

There has been an overall yearly upward trend with the dividend payout, however, the payouts are inconsistent month to month. Below is the payout for 2020 alone (Based on a payout of $1.04 per share)

&#x200B;

|Month|Amount|Yield|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Jan|$0.04|0.97%|
|Feb|\-|\-|
|Mar|$0.10|3.3%|
|Apr|$0.09|2.65%|
|May|$0.07|1.92%|
|June|$0.12|3.18%|
|July|$0.0550|1.4%|
|Aug|$0.07|1.67%|
|Sept|$0.07|1.72%|

# Sector Weightings (November 2020):

* Industrials - 19.23%
* Consumer Staples - 14.49%
* Materials - 2.79%
* Financials - 5.29%
* Health Care - 15.42%
* Consumer Discretionary - 9.40%
* Energy - 0.93%
* Utilities - 1.66%
* Information Technology - 25.48%
* Communication Services - 5.32%

# Top Holdings:

* Apple - 6.86%
* Microsoft - 5.51%
* Verizon - 5.23%
* Procter & Gamble - $.37%
* PepsiCo - 2.88%
* Merck & Co - 2.88%
* Altaria - 2.56%
* Comcast - 2.18% (*Gross*)

For this one the top holdings were included to show why this fund has more weighting in Technology than NOBL did. The heavier weightings can produce more risk/reward to the portfolio due to the recent boom from Tech, and the cyclical nature of industrials. There is a signficant underweighting in energy, however this can be seen as both a positive and negative. The energy companies tend to have high yields, however COVID has put many of them in a difficult position. Looking at you XOM. 

# Advantages, Disadvantages & 5-yr Performance:

Advantages:

* Quality Holdings
* Focused on stocks with good earnings and competitive advantages
* Very Well Diversified with 266 holdings 
* More exposure to Tech
* Monthly Payouts
* Strong performance even when compared to S&P500 ETF - VOO (with higher yeild)

Disadvantages:

* More growth stocks than most dividend ETFs (this could be an advantage as well)
* Acceptable Expense Ratio, still slightly high.
* Yield is low compared to single stocks
   * This is just the disadvantage of ETFs to single stocks really. 

Performance: (As of November 2020, this is very likely to change)

|1 Year|3 Year|5 Year|
|:-|:-|:-|
|17.88%|13.04%|12.26%|

# Takeaways and Final Thoughts:

Overall this is a high quality monthly paying ETF with very strong performance and solid holdings. The yield is still low compared to single stocks and is lower compared to some similar ETFs due to holding more growth oriented stocks, however it performs very well due to its tendency to have value oriented holdings in its portfolio. 

For dividend growth investors the yield on this ETF is a bit low and there is only 1 year of consecutive dividend growth. If Dividend Growth is your goal, then look for another ETF or cherry pick some of the good companies from the portfolio. 

This was just a quick review, so please supplement this with your own research. Thankyou for taking the time to read, hopefully some found this helpful. Have a good day everyone.",109,0.98,1605378603.0
t3_ju62tr,Starwood Property Trust - good value and sustainable income in expensive market,"Starwood Property Trust(STWD) has been a really compelling stock that has been greatly overlooked until it's recent run up to $17 on vaccine news. Barry Sternlicht, the CEO, thinks the company is incredibly undervalued at current prices. I have to agree, as he gave his reasoning behind his valuation of the company which seems to be spot on. I've been holding this baby since $11 but am considering buying more if it pulls back, would love to hear everyone's thoughts.

""So if you believe our $3 of fair value that's not in the undepreciated book value, bringing our fair value above $20 a share, let's take the $15.86, let's take the $3 out of it, that's $12.06. That's the $3 of equity assets that are largely either fully leased industrial buildings or affordable housing assets that are in some of the best markets in the country and stay completely full because rents are 30% below fair value of garden apartments of market-rate apartments. And then take out the accumulated depreciation of $1.30, you're buying our stock at $10.76 against the GAAP book value of $15.86 That's 66% of the GAAP value of our company.

Our average loan is 61% LTV. So you're buying these assets in the loans at $0.41 at par of the fair value of the asset. And for that, you're getting a 13% dividend yield. Seems a little ridiculous.

So there's no way property values and what we have linked against are down 60%. So I don't think anyone's even considered that as a possibility. So our issue has always been the same issue. We could pay our dividend forever, and forever is a long time."" -Barry Sternlicht in Q3 CC

t3_jur1nc,Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) vs PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) - A Quick Comparison - Which is better?,"# Introduction:

Good Morning/Evening everyone. Today will be a comparison between Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Lets first look at the company moats, starting with Pepsi...

# PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP):

Dividend Aristocrat: 48 Years of Consecutive Dividend Growth

Pepsi isn't only the #2 beverage company (Just behind KO), but it is the #1 in snacks. It's business is concentrated on convienience items and is divided into the following 6 segments:

PepsiCo (PEP) is the global leader in the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of food (52%) and beverages (48%). The company is # 2 only to Coca-Cola in beverages, and # 1 in snacks. Profits are derived approximately 58% from the United States and 42% international. (Revenue based on October 2020 reports)

* PepsiCo America Beverages (34% of Revenues)
* Frito-Lay North America (25%)
* PepsiCo Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (16%)
* Latin America Foods (11%)
* PepsiCo AMEA (Asia, Middle East, North Africa) 10%
* Quaker Foods North America (4%)

The following are noteworthy brands that are owned by PepsiCo:

>Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7 Up, Miranda, Sierra Mist, Gatorade, Tropicana, Lipton, Aquafina, Brisk, Starbucks RTD Beverages, Lay’s, Doritos, Quaker, Cheetos, Ruffles, Tostitos, Fritos, and Walkers.

Their expose to food/snacks provides a significant advantage to Pepsi, greatly increasing its yearly revenue, and providing the company significant staying power. (Especially during market downturns). The biggest weakness to their model is the move towards healthier food and drink options, Pepsi is very aware of this and is aggressively moving into this market, currently,  Approximately 25% of PepsiCo revenues come from everyday nutrition products. 

So let's compare their business to Coca-Cola.

# Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)

Dividend King: 58 Years of Consecutive Dividend Growth

Coca-Cola is the largest nonalcoholic beverage company in the world. Unlike PepsiCo, Coca-Cola remains exclusively in the beverage business. Some of its brands include:

>Coca-Cola, Fanta, Schweppes, Sprite, Dasani, Smartwater, Powerade, VitaminWater, Minute Maid, Innocent, Simply, Fairlife, Georgia Coffee, Costa Coffee **(A recent UK Acquisition),** Fuze Tea, Honest, Gold Peak, Peace Tea

Coca-Cola's concentration in the beverage industry is what allows them to dominate. They have very high brand loyalty, direct manufacturing and distribution systems, and established relationships with retailers worldwide which provide significant barriers to entry for any potential new competitors. Recently Coke has made some smart acquisitions, such as Costa Coffee in the UK (about 1/3 of all coffee sales), and has been eliminating less popular products to increase revenue and focus on what is working.

Its advantage is also its greatest weakness, Coca-Colas company model relies solely on the beverage industry which makes it much more susceptible to market fluctuations, and environmental issue, such as reliance on potable pure water. Additionally Coke has done less than Pepsi to move into healthier industries. It is very likely on their radar. 

# Quick Look at Numbers:

NOTE: Numbers are currently for November 2020 and are likely to change.

|\-|PEPSICO|COCA-COLA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.09|$1.64|
|Yield|2.83%|3.07%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|8%|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|9%|4.6%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|8.7%|2.6%|
|Current Payout Ratio|\~73%|\~77%|
|Free Cash Flow / Share|$4.56|$1.50|
|Revenue|$18.09 Billion|$8.65 Billion|
|Debt / Equity Ratio|3.31 (Not very Healthy)|2.84 (Healthier but still eh)|

Based on the basic numbers and the previously mentioned business model Pepsi has a bit more stability when compared to Coca-Cola due to having a wider market and increased revenue. However we can also see that PepsiCo currently leverages more debt, however most of it is long term debt that is very unlikely to adversely affect the company, especially since consumer defensive companies are profitable even in market downturns. 

Based on the dividend growth, Pepsi is the clear winner. It has had a higher 10 year return, and its recent history shows that it isn't slowing down. The payouts are very similar, and if Coca-Cola does not increase its dividend growth rate then Pepsi will overtake its yield in the near future. The payout ratios are a bit high right now, below 75% is a better ratio, however this can be given a pass since 2020 has been a wild ride, if those ratios continue to increase over the next years then that will call their dividend safety into question.

# Final Thoughts:

The future for the companies will be interesting. Undoubtedly we will see more advancement into healthier beverage/food options, but the bigger question is what will Coca-Cola's future moves be after eliminating its less popular brands? How will environmental factors affect their businesses. 

Which is your favorite between the two? Or both? Both is good?

Please supplement this with your own research, we only glanced at the numbers, so take the time to read more into their books or business models.

Where’s the best place for me to start doing all of this? I’m UK based and good with technology websites and apps so whichever has the best options for beginners I’ll use. 

Should I stick to my plan of starting with an index fund that follows something like the S&P 500 or FTSE 100 and then when I get more confident look into a few more groups/individuals to add in?

Should I entirely go for dividend paying ones? I saw an investor say he only invests in ones that pay dividends and while that makes sense to me I figured there’s gotta be a reason why ones that don’t get huge investments too.

Good afternoon r/dividends,

For those not familiar with United States financial laws, the title of this post may be rather jarring to you. After all, the lead moderator of r/dividends not using a bank.  It sounds crazy.  But allow me to explain.  I keep 100% of my liquid financial assets (cash) at a Credit Union.  

Some of you may be confused.  Some of you may think this post was clickbait.  I can assure you it is not.  Here in the United States, Credit Unions are **extremely** distinct from banks.  Here are some exerpts per Wikipedia's [article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union).

> Credit unions differ from [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank) and other financial institutions in that those who have accounts in the credit union are its members and owners, and they elect their board of directors in a [one-person-one-vote system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_man_one_vote) regardless of their amount invested.   
>  
>Credit unions offer many of the same financial services as banks but often use different terminology. Typical services include share accounts ([savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account)), share draft accounts ([checking accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_account)), [credit cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card), share term certificates ([certificates of deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit)), and [online banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_banking). Normally, only a member of a credit union may [deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account) or [borrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan) [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money). Surveys of customers at banks and credit unions have consistently shown significantly higher customer satisfaction rates with the quality of service at credit unions.  
>  
>Credit unions have historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation. In the context of [financial inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_inclusion), credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most [microfinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance) institutions.  
>  
>In the credit union context, ""[not-for-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not-for-profit)"" must be distinguished from a charity. Credit unions are ""not-for-profit"" because their purpose is to serve their members rather than to maximize profits, so unlike charities, credit unions do not rely on donations and are financial institutions that must make what is, in economic terms, a small [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(economics)) (i.e., in non-profit accounting terms, a ""surplus"") to remain in existence. According to the [World Council of Credit Unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Council_of_Credit_Unions) (WOCCU), a credit union's [revenues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue) (from loans and investments) must exceed its operating expenses and [dividends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend) (interest paid on deposits) in order to maintain capital and solvency.  
>  
>In the United States, credit unions incorporated and operating under a state credit union law are tax-exempt under [Section 501(c)(14)(A)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)). Federal credit unions organized and operated in accordance with the [Federal Credit Union Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Credit_Union_Act) are tax-exempt under [Section 501(c)(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)).  
>  
>Credit unions often form cooperatives among themselves to provide services to members. A [credit union service organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union_service_organization) (CUSO) is generally a for-profit subsidiary of one or more credit unions formed for this purpose. For example, [CO-OP Financial Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO-OP_Financial_Services), the largest credit-union-owned [interbank network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbank_network) in the United States, provides an ATM network and shared branching services to credit unions. Other examples of cooperatives among credit unions include credit counseling services as well as insurance and investment services.   
>  
>In the United States, federal credit unions are chartered by and overseen by the [National Credit Union Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Credit_Union_Administration) (NCUA), which also provides deposit insurance similar to the manner in which the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation) (FDIC) provides deposit insurance to banks. State-chartered credit unions are overseen by the state's financial regulatory agency and may, but are not required to, obtain deposit insurance. Because of problems with bank failures in the past, no state provides deposit insurance and as such there are two primary sources for depository insurance – the NCUA and [American Share Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Share_Insurance) (ASI), a private insurer based in Ohio. 

Here in the United States, 41% of Americans old enough to have a control over a financial account already utilizes a credit union as their primary financial services provider.  These are **not** banks.  They by legal definition cannot be banks.  A bank is by its very nature a for-profit entity.  A credit union can never be for-profit.  

To all the people messaging me daily asking for financial advice, asking me where to put your money, I would recommend a credit union.  I have never seen a bank even come close to matching the interest rate of my local credit union.  I recommend pulling out google and searching around your area.  A lot of credit unions are geography based.  So long as you live within a certain distance of a branch of the credit union (ie the same county) you are eligible to become a member (though many do have other requirements, such as a particular employer, income level, etc.).  

I personally see the greatest asset of credit unions coming in the form of all the services they provide.  Things like free financial and investment advice (excellent for new investors), as well as easy to understand savings options to help build your wealth.  Things like Money Market Accounts, IRAs, and even savings accounts.  Credit Unions do them better and they give you more money, because they do not have to make a profit.  Just enough to keep the lights on.

I would at least consider it when choosing which company you will keep your money in for the rest of your life.  I have been a credit union member since the day I was born, and my future children will be the same way.

t3_jv0q36,What I have planned for the remainder of 2020...,"Good afternoon r/dividends,

The following is the (current) schedule of major events I have planned for the remainder of 2020.  All of these are on the Calendar in the sidebar.

&#x200B;

November 18 - Reveal of the new community awards.

November 25 - A meta post.  It's a secret.

November 30 - Monthly permanent banned users archive post.

December 2 - A guide to new moderators. (This will be a wiki page I create that I can direct any future moderators towards.  I am not expanding the mod team anytime soon.  I just plan things months or even years in advance.)

December 15 - A wiki guide to posting designed for new users. This will explain how to post content to r/dividends. 

December 25 - A detailed, intricately complex explanation of my personal dividend portfolio that might hit Reddit's character limit.

December 31 - Monthly permanent banned users archive post.

January 1 - 1st annual state of the subreddit and solicitation for feedback.

Every week on Friday at 12am UTC the  u/DividendsModTeam account will automatically refresh the Weekly Portfolio Feedback thread.  

**A few notes:**

* Over the remainder of 2020, I will be testing pretty much every single feature Reddit offers moderators.  When applicable to the community, I will announce them in advance, but many are behind the scenes kinds of features that do not impact your life on this subreddit.  Going into 2021, I want to fully grasp and understand every tool available to me as moderator of this subreddit.
* This post is actually testing the event feature.  I am just seeing what it does.
* I intend to overhaul the community awards system.  Suggestions welcome.
* We have user flairs.  I like user flairs.  I like users that like user flairs.
* Let me know your feedback on having the calendar in the sidebar (this post is not locked by the way, so feel free to comment.)
* Quick PSA: I will no longer respond to unsolicited Direct Messages.  I get too many, yet we can go days without receiving modmail.  It makes no sense.  Use modmail people.  If you want an actual answer in a decent amount of time, use modmail if it pertains to anything r/dividends.

t3_juxsj3,3M (NYSE: MMM) - A Quick Guide/Review - A Dividend King,"# Introduction:

3M, previously known as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, might not be the most iconic corporation, however it is one of the largest in the US, in fact, they are one of the few companies actually still in the DOW Jones. 3M has been an incredibly innovative company since its humble beginnings, it currently holds over 118,000 patents. They are involved extensively in industry, worker safety, US health care, and consumer goods, producing over 60,000 different products, and operating in over 70 countries.

Right now, 3M is organized into these four business segments:

* Safety and Industrial
* Transportation and Electronics
* Health Care
* Consumer Discretionary

# Company Strengths & Risks:

Strengths:

3M is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of increasing their dividend.

3M has strong branding, strong control over a large number of patents and technology, and is a low-cost producer of good. The company is well diversified amoung its 4 segments, this shields them against cyclic revenue streams. Additionally,  3M is expanding rapidly into new emerging markets, and has been good at making small acquisitions that propel growth/product acquisition.

Risks:

The companies number of patents is also a disadvantage, it causes the company to have to allocate more money towards litigations. In addition to this, the low-cost good produced by other companies require 3M to be more careful with its pricing. Lastly, the products they produce have a life-cycle, so more money needs to be allocated to R&D to produce relevant and quality products. (Not that they have had an issue with this)

# Let's Look at the Numbers:

NOTE: Numbers are currently for November 2020 and are likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$5.88|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|3.46%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|10.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|9.1%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|66.67%|
|Free Cash Flow / Share|$10.86|
|Revenue|$8.35 Billion|
|Debt / Equity Ratio|1.91 (Healthy)|

3M has some healthy looking financials despite COVID. This has a lot to do with their diversification, while they have lost money in Industrials and Consumer products, they have buffered this with their exposure to Health Care, in fact the company is producing many of the N95 masks being used now.

3M has very strong prospects for dividend growth. Their EPS payout of 66% indicates they still have quite enough wiggle room to continue increasing the dividend, and the 3, 5, and 10 year increases have been superb. They can be given a pass for their 1 year increase due to COVID.

If fact, lets take their 3-year average and project that forward to guesstimate what their future payouts could be. (These are estimates! The actual payouts could be wildly different.)

|Year|Potential Payout (Based on 9%)|
|:-|:-|
|2021|$6.40|
|2022|$6.61|
|2023|$6.84|
|2024|$7.03|

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

3M is an excellent dividend growth stock. The company has a wide moat, strong revenue, is smart with its acquisitions, and has healthier levels of debt compared to many similar companies. The company would be strongly recommended for any dividend/dividend growth focused portfolio.

Please supplement this with your own research, there are more numbers out there, plus the company has an interesting history and it is worth reading up on if you are interested.

For me, it is one of my larger positions. Don't take that and run though! Always do your own research and come to your own conclusions about whether or not you like and want to invest into a company.

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!",123,0.96,1605489846.0

t3_jvkcl9,Let's talk REG,"A couple of people have commented on my recent thread on selling SPHD saying they're glad they kept the fund. Good for them. SPHD, like many value stocks/funds, has risen on vaccine news. A propos.

They have a solid portfolio, appear to be well managed, and work with investment grade tenants. They kept their dividend, unlike Brixmor, which would have looked similarly well positioned prior to covid but postponed their dividend with nary a bat of the eye.

Anyone have any thoughts on REG? Yes, it's ""malls,"" but it is the kind of malls that do well even in fairly poor areas.

t3_jw7lu7,Unveiling the new community awards,"Good afternoon r/dividends,

In my moderation of this community, I have been working to create an environment of positivity and mutual benefit.  In the pursuit of this goal, I have henceforth commissioned the creation of 20 new community awards, the maximum allowable under Reddit's guidelines.  16 shall be bestowed between users of the community.  Four shall be issued solely by the moderation team.

For the past two months I have been experimenting with a way to create awards that would be considered meaningful, worthwhile, and legitimate by the community.  To fulfill that goal, I have chosen to take a page from my days editing Wikipedia and co-opt the barnstar system in place over there.

A brief explainer for the uninitiated, on Wikipedia it is customary to award users for their hard work and due diligence by giving them what are known as ""Barnstars."" [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars) is a link explaining what barnstars are to Wikipedia and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstar) is the link for those who have no idea what a barnstar even is in real life.  Since their introduction in 2003 on Wikipedia, they have become ingrained in the site's editing culture.  They promote civility and positivity in the community.  By bringing them to r/dividends, I intend to replicate that experience one gets when you receive them on Wikipedia.

I will not attempt to define for you the circumstances upon which you the community wish to utilize these awards.  Instead, I will state two things that may pique your interest.

The first is the moderator awards.  It is my intention for 100% of coin revenue generated to be put back into members of this community.  There are four moderator issued awards:

* Award 1 is the Barnstar of Noteworthy Merit.  The cost to the community is 1800 coins.  The plan is for it to be issued automatically by mods to any post deemed worthy of entry into the Moderator's Collection.  Per the autogenerated description:  ""Shows the Barnstar of Noteworthy Merit Award and gives the recipient 1 month of Premium (which includes 700 Coins a month).""
* Award 2 is the Barnstar of Integrity.  The cost to the community is 5400 coins.  I have told the moderators they may issue it at their discretion.  Per the award description: ""Shows the Barnstar of Integrity Award and gives the recipient 3 months of Premium (which includes 700 Coins a month).""
* Award 3 is the Barnstar of Excellence Award.  The cost to the community is 10,800 coins.  I have told the moderators they may issue it at their discretion.  Per the award description:  ""Shows the Barnstar of Excellence Award and gives the recipient 6 months of Premium (which includes 700 Coins a month).""
* Award 4 is the Barnstar of Ultimate Merit Award.  The cost to the community is 21,600 coins.  This award will be given to any post that can dethrone the top post of all time (mod posts are not eligible).  Per the award description: ""Shows the Barnstar of Ultimate Merit Award and gives the recipient 12 months of Premium (which includes 700 Coins a month).""

The second note is that I will remove any moderators that try to give moderator awards to another moderator.  I have been very careful in selecting who I believe to be a great group of people who would never even contemplate such a quid pro quo idea, which is why I am not concerned about this happening in the slightest.  I am just letting you the community know that mods here will not be receiving free premium, unless it comes from you guys gilding our posts.

I will be here to answer any questions you may have once I get some sleep in.  Thank you for your participation in r/dividends.",51,0.93,1605675607.0

I  Load up on shares and I bot them 2 weeks ago at 368 after selling my PFE shares for there high div.

Membership-only supermarket chain Costco Wholesale Corp <COST.O> on Monday declared a special dividend of $10 per share as it benefits from consumers stocking up essentials due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sending its shares up about 2% after the bell.

The dividend totaling $4.4 billion would be funded through existing cash. It will be paid on Dec. 11 and is the company's fourth such payout in eight years.

Higher demand for fresh produce, appliances and gardening and sporting goods has helped the warehouse chain record growing sales and traffic at its stores, where customers typically buy items in bulk at lower prices.

Separately, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> said it has dissolved its stake in Costco and started new investments in drugmakers including Pfizer <PFE.N> and Merck <MRK.N>.

You can't really do this in a Reg T account because you need 150% or 200% of the stock's value held in reserve. I was considering switching to Portfolio Margin, and it looks like there's no margin difference between being long or short a stock there.

Downsides include:

* If the company gets bought out or management changes or \[...\], they could rise even if the original business was unlikely to rise.
* The stock you buy could tank, and now you've lost borrowed money.
* You have to pay dividends & interest on the stocks you short.
* The stocks you buy could cut or stop dividends.
* You can buy options to mitigate catastrophic loss, but those eat into your net yield.
* You can sell options to avoid paying or receiving dividends, but they can be assigned at any time so maybe not reliable for long-term arbitrage.",6,0.76,1605792145.0
t3_jwvf9b,My personal opinion on Republic Bancorp ($RBCAA).,"The following is an opinion piece, and should be treated as such. It should not be taken as a substitute for conducting your own research. 

Overview: 

Republic Bancorp is a regional bank headquartered in Louisville Kentucky.  Not to be confused with the California bank of a similar name.  The market cap is currently under $800 million, and the company employs roughly 1080 people as of their last filings.

[Link to Seeking Alpha Financial Data](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBCAA/income-statement).

----------------------

My one sentence opinion: A smaller bank, but one I hold in high regard.

----------------------

My longform opinion: 

On Thursday, November 19, 2020 I will be directing 100% of my bi-monthly purchasing activity into acquiring shares of Republic Bancorp at market open. This is very unusual for me. Normally, I am insistant upon letting M1's autoinvest handle everything for me. However, the markets seem to be completely ignoring this company.

The metrics make absolutely no sense.  If the market was perfect, you would never see all of these metrics together. Ask any professional analyst and they would tell you this is an impossibility.

Yield is over 3% while payout ratio is ~30%.  Payout ratio has been trending down, and has pretty much been cut in half over the last five years.  Meanwhile, the dividend has continued to grow, creating a 21 year dividend growth streak with an average growth rate of 8% annually, beating out many major companies. All the while this stock has a P/E ratio of 10.  Revenue has almost doubled over the last five years. Profits have more than doubled over the last five years. For every dollar this company earns, 31.52 cents is pure profit. And that ratio is increasing. All the while customers still speak very highly of the bank. EPS has tripled over the past five years. It doesn't appear to be engaging in anything illegal.   Book value per share is currently higher than the average share price at the time of writing this piece.

I could keep going, but you get the idea. For those who just read the income statements and look at the share price, you may see skepticism. But one singular metric reveals why this stock is currently down 20% over the past year, despite being in an objectively better position than it was back then. That metric is the institutional ownership. 29.32% of this company is held by institutions (aka companies). 3.69% is held by insiders (aka the people who run the company).  The rest is held by the general public. Either in index funds, ETFs, or as individual shares. This is why the price is where it is. Companies are the reason we can see massive price action pushing a stock up or down. With an average volume of only 15-20 thousand, clearly this stock is not being day-traded by any major firms. At least not at any serious level. It is mostly retail investors trading with other retail investors. Most of whom are likely simply using buy options to purchase the security at whatever the current price is. Hence why the stock's value is slow to recover from covid.

After the market plunged in February, many institutions feared a 2009 repeat, so they pulled out of regional banks. This caused their stocks to enter free fall. Many Republic Bank insiders appear to have taken advantage of that opportunity. I as a retail investor, will also be taking advantage of this rare opportunity to set the stage for increasing my yield on cost. Once institutions realize this bank actually was not hurt by covid, they will likely return and cause the price to recover. Even if they don't, I will still have the stable dividend and a management team that appears to genuinely care about the direction of their firm.",4,0.75,1605757701.0
t3_jwv7m6,"Kimberly-Clark vs Procter & Gamble, which one to invest for long term?","I've been looking into these 2 companies.

From my research, they're both very similar in what products they make and also pretty similar in age.

Procter & Gamble has been around a bit longer and is currently a Dividend King while Kimberly-Clark is still an Aristocrat.

&#x200B;

From my calculations (which i calculated by doing \[Forward Dividend : EPS x 100\]) both of them have a similar Dividend Payout Ratio:

Kimberly Clark = 62%

Procter & Gamble = 60%

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The one difference i did find is the Dividend Yield and i know you're not supposed to chase yield and a higher yield is not always a good sign but it's not to high either.

Kimberly-Clark's current Dividend Yield = \~2.98%

Procter & Gamble's current Dividend Yield = \~2.26%

&#x200B;

As a younger investor (mid-20s) would it be wiser for me to invest in Kimberly-Clark as they have a lot more room to grow and are still an Dividend Aristocrat or would it be better to invest in Procter & Gamble who are already a Dividend King.

t3_jxxkhk,I’m honestly surprised no one has talked about what’s happening at Berkshire Hathaway,"So I’m putting this here because it seems like r/dividends would understand Warren Buffett far better than a few other stock subs would. [Berkshire Hathaway’s Odd Behaviors ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/19/no-joke-buffett-has-now-sold-35-stocks-in-9-months/)

It seems Warren Buffett may no longer be making the big decisions of stock picks at Berkshire Hathaway and letting his other employees have a crack at the market. I realize he’s been doing this for probably a decade but I think it’s recent events that really highlight who may be running the company. A lot of the recent events we’ve seen come from Berkshire of late is very atypical of Warren’s stock process. Massive losses with airlines (along with moving into airlines in the first place), moving into tech (which may make sense since times are changing), picking up pharmaceutical companies, and actual stock selling of long term holdings when he said he would likely hold these stocks forever, and more. It seems Warren’s company is turning into a typical investor firm rather than that legendary stock picking he’s known for. 

I think the moment I stumbled on this happened to be when Berkshire sold off Costco at a time where it would make sense to hold Costco and given Costco is Charlie Munger’s cup of tea. Ever since then I’ve noticed more and more atypical Warren decisions and I’m wondering why

It obviously makes sense that he cedes company control because he can’t live forever but I would have thought the people under him understood his principles and would have continued the practice after decades of training",146,0.97,1605906548.0

t3_jxnxxz,Xerox - Looking for Opinions,"Im interested in getting others opinions on Xerox as it initially looked like a good prospect to me, for dividend income with a yield sitting at ~5% and a payout ratio of ~60%. 

Their dividend growth rate over the last 10 years has been on average ~5% per year. However there hasn't been much growth recently in that in over the last 5 years the dividend growth rate has been on average ~-2.20% per year and over the last 3 years the dividend growth rate has been on average ~-6.90% per year.

They have a pretty healthy balance sheet and cash flow statement too so I feel like they may be able to weather the pandemic. However, ignoring the pandemic, their overall growth does seem to have stagnated in recent years. Revenue and EPS growth are both negative based on over the last 3 years. EPS growth is positive if you look at over the last 5 years though, at ~2.87%.

So now I'm not too sure about it because of it's lack of growth in recent years and lack of growth forecasted in the future. 

Interested to hear other peoples opinions on Xerox? Also would be interested to hear some better alternatives at a similiar dividend yield and payout ratio (Above 4% yield, below 70% payout ratio, i.e TATE, BAE, FXPO, BNS).",3,0.8,1605874321.0

t3_jxgnda,A brief word so I do not get sued...,"Good afternoon r/dividends,

Over the last few days I have been looking around the internet for inspiration in regards to the subreddit's banner image. This afternoon I found it located here: [https://vectortoons.com/products/a-stockbroker-making-a-trade-call-over-the-phone-and-stock-exchange-trading-floor-background?\_pos=2&\_sid=db14e32ea&\_ss=r](https://vectortoons.com/products/a-stockbroker-making-a-trade-call-over-the-phone-and-stock-exchange-trading-floor-background?_pos=2&_sid=db14e32ea&_ss=r)

&#x200B;

The following should be considered by any legal teams working for vectorcartoons as criticism and review of the image:

I personally would have been willing to pay $20 for a stock photo image of high quality and finished design, but unfortunately looking at your image I realized it would be unusable in its original form.  To begin with, when uploaded into a photo editing software, the image contains many corrupt pixels.  Either the artist did not notice or did not care.  I am sorry vectorcartoons, but I refuse to pay for an unfinished product.  I spent four hours fixing your inferior product just to get me to a blank template capable of being worked with.  And do not even get me started on the jackass idiot taking up half the image.  Like stand a little closer to the camera please.  2/10.  Would not pay for.

So what I did was I decided to air out my frustration and grievance by creating a parody image of your design, vectorcartoons.  To ensure the r/dividends community will be adequately able to see my parody image, I have set it to be the banner image for this subreddit on mobile devices.  Do not worry,  I will remove it once 99.99% of all humanity has witnessed the image.  So within a reasonable period of time.

To make this parody image, I took your stock photo and imported it into a program called [paint.net](https://paint.net).  The program is free.  I took to painstakingly removing each of the dozens of watermarks littered throughout the image.  I then cut out the idiot man, mirrored what was left, and resized it to match the dimensions Reddit prefers for mobile banner images (1600x480).  I then went through the r/dividends community and selected the following users, whose Reddit Avatars I inserted into the image.  Below they are listed in alphabetical order:

* u/036Gooddaysir036
* u/10000000000000000091

* u/SeekNDestroy
* u/The-BEAST

I intend to make another one of these parody images for the desktop since the dimensions are so different from the mobile needs, so if you desire to be in the next one, I suggest you choose a user flair.  When in the moderator's menu, I can view a list of every subreddit user who has a user flair.  Next time, I will be pulling from that list.

t3_jxgg6f,IBM (NYSE: IBM) - An In-depth Stock Analysis,"# Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

>\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
>  
>\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
>  
>\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

>\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
>  
>\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
>  
>\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

EDIT: Fixed some math errors. Thanks everyone for the comments, remember this post wasn't an endorsement or recommendation to buy or sell, just something to get brain juices going. ",107,0.97,1605838092.0

I want to offer DD on one of my speculation plays and may do other speculation play write-ups depending on the interest. Thank you to u/036Gooddaysir036 for allowing their templates to be used.

# Introduction:

Hasbro is one of the most well known, but never talked about companies. Hasbro is a dividend contender, having grown their dividend for 17 years. They are most well known for their focus in consumer products, gaming, and entertainment. Hasbro is also diversified into retail, digital retail, eCommerce, and omni-channel retail, offering a cushion against Covid-19.

Some recognizable big names and games under HAS:

Transformers, Play-Doh, Nerf, Baby Alive, Magic: the Gathering, Monopoly, My Little Pony, Peppa Pig, Pjmasks, Power Rangers, Jenga, Connect 4, Life, Operation, Furreal friends, HASCON, Dungeons and Dragons.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

- Is there revenue growth?
- Is there earnings growth?
- Is the company really leveraged?
- Is there strong cash flow?

## Company Strengths & Risks:

Strengths:

- 17 consecutive years of increasing their dividend
- Strong branding, Strong and diverse products and partnerships
- Acquirement of eOne (Entertainment One), Allspark pictures, and allspark animation
- Acquirement of Milton Bradley, Playskool and Tonka
- Agreements with Disney for Star Wars, and other similar rights

Risks:

- COVID 19 has slowed supply and likely will have an impact on demand until COVID 19 ends. COVID 19 has also shifted live action production to 2021. [Hasbro's response to COVID 19](https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/e3715112-0362-4a2c-a8aa-220171ecff91)
- Agreement with Disney is costly but beneficial to both sides. Listed as a risk due to the drain on cash. 
- relatively high payout ratio (75.45).
- Free cash flow fluctuates year to year

## Financial History and numbers

Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HAS/balance-sheet?p=HAS) as of Nov 2020

 Current Annual Payout/Share | $2.72  
-----------------------------|--------
 Yield                       | 2.92%  
 10 Yr Div Growth Rate       | 12.81% 
 3 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 10.29% 
 1 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 1.87%  
 Years Of Growth             | 17     
 Current Payout Ratio        | 75.45  
 Free Cash Flow / Share      | 2.83   
 Revenue                     | 1.78B  
 Debt / Equity Ratio         | 1.35   
 
(napkin math: 4,046,960/2,995,530=1.35)

HAS has pretty healthy financials despite COVID and being in the Consumer Cyclical sector. The payout ratio is high but I attribute it to acquisitions and partnerships. Revenue has been reported to be strong too with respect to Magic the Gathering, Monopoly, and Dungeons and Dragons from the Q3 earnings call. Those increases too, are phenomenal. In fact, lets project this forward to guesstimate the future payouts. (These are estimates, the actual payouts can range differently)

 Year | Potential payout (based on 10.29%) 
------|------------------------------------
 2021 | 2.82                               
 2022 | 3.03                               
 2023 | 3.33                               
 2024 | 3.76                               

Hasbro's [dividend history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAS/dividends/history) makes it all the more appealing to me.

## Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

HAS to me is an excellent speculation play for dividend growth. The company has many recognized household names and shows, and is strengthening its ties with entertainment and toys. The dividend history and growth is phenomenal. I would highly recommend looking into this company if you are a younger dividend growth investor. The downside is that the company is tied up financially due to these partnerships, and has the same negatives that consumer cyclical companies face. 

HAS has the ability to continue paying and growing due to its many brands lasting through the generations. Past names such as Transformers, Monopoly, Play-doh, My Little Pony, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic the Gathering transcend generations. Players of the beloved games and franchises often are hooked and want to collect more memorabilia.

t3_jyefws,Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - An in-depth Stock Analysis,"# Introduction:

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll, so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson & Johnson:

Johnson & Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson & Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

>\-  Johnson & Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
>  
>\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
>  
>\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
>  
>\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

>\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
>  
>\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
>  
>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

t3_jz1ds0,Monthly dividends,"We all love monthly dividends. However, we often find monthly payers where the underlying asset depreciates over time. These are some of my favorite ETFs that pay monthly that also appreciate. 

- SPHD

- DHS

I have all these except DHS.

Monthly non-ETFs for me include

my question to all of you is what would your argument be against allocating a large portion of your portfolio in these monthly payers that also appreciate over time?

Recently I have come across the idea of the r/dividends subreddit playing host to AMAs. For those new to Reddit, an AMA is short for an Ask Me Anything.  With this sub recently crossing 50k members and continuing to grow, I am putting it forward to this community. Should I attempt to set up AMAs with people, and if so, who?

Under no circumstances would I allow an individual who has been banned for self-promotion to engage in an AMA.  Let me be clear about that.  But individuals with no history of self promotion would be eligible.

If you are an actual cooperate executive of a major dividend paying company or a dividend based Youtuber/Content Creator, reach out to me via reddit Direct Messages.  Be expected to provide proof, because unfortunately scammers exist.

Suppose you as a member of r/dividends were in favor of an AMA.  **Who would you want to see?**  Personally, I think an AMA with Sumit Roy (the CEO of Realty Income) would be very interesting and I think this community would really enjoy something like that.  Or maybe Joseph Carlson.  Or Andrei Jikh.  I do not know.

t3_jz7ngx,Dividend Capture Strategy questions,"Hi all, hope everyone is doin well and their portfolios even better. I’m very new to trading and investing (about 6months now) and things are going well, I’m about back to breaking even after some initial learning curve losses that I budgeted for. 

Long story short, my main strategy has been day/swing scalping but lately, I’ve been very interested with dividend yielding stocks/ETFs. So much that I’ve looked into the whole Dividend Capture strategy. Seems to work for some and criticized by others. I was wondering if anyone else has tried this and has it work for them. I understand that dividend capture is difficult because ex-dates typically open up less the dividend amount on the price. I’m looking to approach it 1 of 3 ways (or even test all of these out).

1. Play the run-up to the ex-date. I notice typically on Q or A div payouts, there is a substantial price run-up followed by the expected drop off on the ex-date so you overcome the ex-date price difference, look for an entry about the same amount less in prior run-ups on ex-dates. This could be days or even weeks out. 

2. Play the ex-div date. Essentially buy on the ex-div date after the expected drop then just hold until the next ex-div date.

3. Purchase shortly before the ex-div date and then just hold until I’ve covered my loss, having still captured the dividend.

My plan is to start this mainly on Monthly Ds and then try to apply this to Quarterly and up from there. While I understand that many people like to look at Quarterly Ds and focus on a spread to where you can get a regular payout each month. I personally think there’s an opportunity to play monthly’s the same and have a rotation for nearly every day of the month. Obviously not just dumping cash into whatever because of the Ex-D, but doing a comparison of the available on a certain day, and selection any from that (or not if none are appealing). 

Anyways, sorry for the length. I wanted to provide as much context as possible. Would love to hear your opinions and suggestions.",11,0.84,1606093372.0
t3_k0dpsh,Portfolio Composition,"Hi guys- I am looking at locking into a long term dividend strategy .  

What I would like to do it is to weight my portfolio with 4 ETF's - each making up 15% of the portfolio and then 8 individual stock each making up 5% of the portfolio. I don't have a hell of a lot of money to invest at the moment so am not really wanting to over diversify at this stage. I also wanted a simple weighting structure that requires minimum upkeep (hence 60% ETF)

Was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on what 4 ETF's they would choose which would accumulatively provide decent diversification, yield and balance across the market. I own DGRO and SCHD at the moment. But would be looking at adding 2 of either VIG, VOO, VYM, VTI, SPHD or NOBL. 

For the 8 individual stocks, I am thinking of AAPL, MSFT, WM, DIS, T, O, ABBV, and KO.. but very open to suggestions.

Massive Revenue growth(40+%), 5% dividend, 12.5 Forward P/E,20% market pentration","\*Disclaimer\*: This company has a limited history in the public markets and has significant risks that are atypical for stocks frequently mentioned on Reddit. Do your **OWN** research before considering investing.[https://ri.betterware.com.mx/financiera/reportes-trimestrales](https://ri.betterware.com.mx/financiera/reportes-trimestrales)

Introduction:

Betterware de Mexico(BWMX) is a consumer Direct-Sales/e-commerce platform that focuses primarily on household products. It recently came public following a merger with DDMX in 2020 and is the first Mexican company to list on the NASDAQ. With an estimated distribution network of 946,000 associates and 54,000 distributors, Betterware is rapidly expanding to cover its market Niche.

Highlights:

43% Revenue growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 60% growth in 2020

47% EBITDA growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 71% growth in 2020

94% Free cash flow growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 105% growth in 2020

Growth is supported through 40% CAGR growth in employees from 2015-2020

19.8% market penetration in 2019, targeted penetration is 26.8% in 2022. Highlights the very long runway Betterware has to grow their market

5% dividend yield with significant ability to increase based on 94% growth in free cash flow

Significant competitive advantage in the distribution network results in 98.5% on-time deliveries with 2-day shipping(wow, that sounds familiar).

International expansion is possible, with Colombia and Peru currently being targeted.

Dividends appear to be apart of long-term strategy with this quote pulled from the 10k ""Due to these low capital requirements and closed working capital cycle, the Company has high cash conversion rate enabling it to annually serve their shareholders through dividends.""

Trades at a 12.53 Forward P/E, which is extremely attractive when you factor in its growth rate

Weakness:

Distribution network requires a significant amount of people, pandemic significantly increased the need for work due to low employment, so talent was easier to attract. When the economy recovers, Betterware will likely find it harder to recruit associates to grow the distribution network.

Only issued dividends in the past 3 quarters, so we can not be certain this is a long-term stradegy.

The business has significant exposure to Mexican currency

The company is likely to experience volatile share prices as low liquidity and history should see significant moves both up and down. 

Last thoughts:

The company has insane potential to grow in both share price and dividend. The valuation likely only exist due to its low profile, having just debuted on the public markets, the argument could be made that this deserved to trade at 50+ multiple. The company has the potential to support massive growth going forward and shares similar characteristics to AMZN, BABA, & MELI all of which have been incredible investments for its shareholders. Of course, being such a small company worth just over a billion dollars there are significant risks that they cannot scale this business and are unsuccessful in the international market.

t3_k118g4,Dividend Capture Strategy,"This tutorial is the process that I go through using dividend stocks to find and evaluate my swing-trades every month. If you have any idea’s or questions about the strategy, please comment below. 

Lets say that we have a stock XYZ that pays a dividend on a monthly basis. At certain points during the month we might not know when the next dividend payment will “officially” be paid out. Most monthly dividend stocks pay their dividend in a pattern each month like on the 2nd Friday of the month or the 10th trading day of the month, etc. The company usually doesn’t publish this information but if you inspect the historical data then you can see the trend or pattern that they use for their ex-dividend date and record-date. We might be able to estimate when the ex-dividend date and record-date will be but until the company officially announces these dates then it will only be an estimate. The day when the company actually announces these dates is referred to as the dividend declaration date.

After the dividend declaration date occurs we have all the dates that we need for the swing-trade, namely: the ex-dividend date, dividend record-date, and the dividend payable date. If we are not able to estimate these dates before the dividend declaration date then it will not be possible for us to do the analysis needed to setup our dividend swing-trade or dividend reinvestment position. For this reason, I typically only enter positions when the ex-dividend date has been confirmed by the company. 

Now that we have all the dates that we need we can start looking at what each one of these dates means.  If I want to collect the dividend on each share of XYZ that I purchase, then I must make sure that I buy XYZ shares before the ex-dividend date. If I buy a stock one business day before its record date, my trade will only settle the day after the record date. I would therefore not be a shareholder of record for receiving the dividend.

So, in order to make sure that I qualify for the dividend I want to buy the stock at least two business days before the date of record, or one day before the ex-dividend date. 

[Where to buy](https://imgur.com/a/ohm0AgT)

Using the graphic above as an example I would need to buy the stock on Monday the 5th to be eligible to receive the dividend payment. Monday the 5th is two trading-days before the date of record and one trading-day before the ex-dividend date. Now it should become more obvious why I use one trading-day before the ex-dividend date as the sell date for my swing-trades. This is a major part of my strategy as I use the run up into the dividend ex-date to make swings.  

The goal for my swing-trades is not to capture the dividend but rather sell my shares at a premium price to the buyers that are willing to pay a premium during the days leading up to the day before the ex-dividend date so that they will be on the record books and will therefore collect the dividend payment for the stock. You can receive gains many times the amount of the dividend by buying early and then selling the rights to these dividend shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date.

People who are in search of high dividend yield using the dividend capture strategy are willing to pay a premium for their shares in the days just before the ex-dividend date because they don’t want to miss out on the dividend payment. The fear of missing out is a very motivating force in the minds of men and women alike and it can be seen in the data that I have collected over the last few years.  

So just to recap the overall strategy is to find a dividend stock that typically has a run up into the ex-dividend date.  To do this I look at historical data 2-14 days prior to determine when the run up into earnings typically starts. 


A couple of suggestions:
1.)	Don’t swing trade stocks that are at or very close to their 52-week high 
2.)	Look for stocks that have been in a down trend since their last ex-div date 

Example: 

To start I narrow my search to stocks that have an ex-date 2-3 weeks out.  This usually brings my window of stocks to research down to about 30-40 stocks.  For this example, I will be looking at stocks with a confirmed Ex-Date between 12/01/2020 and 12/10/2020 this narrows my window down to 18 tickers. 

The stock Tegna (TGNA) looks to have a pretty good setup to me.  TGNA has a quarterly dividend.  At the moment it is about 20% off of its 52-week high..  For this example, I am going to look at the previous 24 dividend Time Periods to determine statistically when Is the best time to buy. 

The below chart shows historically what day has been the best day to buy if I plan on selling the shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date. The chart shows from 2 days out all the way to 14 days out as I have found this Is the sweet spot for the run up into ex-dividend. 

[Historical % returns by day](https://imgur.com/a/Ovuuyh9)

It is clear that for TGNA buying 13 – 14 days out is the way to go (remember this is looking at the pasts 24 dividend periods or 6 years).  Though all of the days running up into ex-dividend are positive.  This is a great sign as history is on our side that this is a good stock to dividend swing trade with. Meaning that historically if I consistently bought all days 2 through 14, I would have been profitable.  To take it one step further I look at what would have happened if I bought 14 days out for each of the previous 24 dividend swing plays. 

In the below chart you can see the exact percent gains for each of the last 24 dividend swing trades if I went with the 14 day out strategy.  When taking a closer look, we can see that there have been swings has high as +30% and as low as -10% which is huge.  I prefer to take a safer approach as I am really only going for a small 3-5% gain each month as I have found that works a lot better in the long run.  

[14 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/OhWXVxY)


To go with a more conservative approach I look at the previous 24 dividend periods for 6 days out.  What I find is that only 2 / 24 previous swing trades on day 6 would have resulted in a loss and only one of those periods would have been significant.  This is more of my style and likely the play that I will go with. 

[6 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/zZG1zZh)

Since the confirmed ex-date for TGNA is 12/10 I will be looking to buy on 12/2 and sell on 12/9.  For this specific example looking at the data I can see that days 2-14 have all be profitable I will likely buy in slowly over the entire period with the majority of shares bought on 12/6.  

I have used this strategy for quite some time and have basically perfected it to the point where on average I am getting returns in the 2-5% region per month.  There are other ways to improve this strategy as well, but I wanted to see if people here were interested in this type of swing trade.   


Important Terminology: 

 Ex-dividend Date: Is the day in which the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value.  Investors who purchased the stock before the ex-dividend data are entitled to the next dividend payment while those who purchased the stock in the ex-dividend date, or after, are not. 
confirmed ex-dividend date – This is the ex-dividend date that has been officially announced by the company on the dividend declaration date. 

dividend capture strategy – A dividend capture strategy is a timing-oriented investment strategy revolving around the purchase and sale of dividend-paying stocks. Dividend capture is specifically the practice of buying a stock just prior to the ex-dividend date in order to capture the dividend, then selling it immediately after the dividend is paid. 


dividend record-date – The record date, or date of record, is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution.",7,0.73,1606339455.0

I'm trying to understand what causes the price to fall on/after the ex-dividend date? Some sources seem to suggest it's a market driven adjustment, while some sources imply the exchange themselves manually lower the opening price (and some even adjust limit orders of investors). 

So which one is it? If it's market driven, I'm not sure I understand how it actually works out to almost exactly the dividend payout. Are market makers actually setting their bids and asks at a lower price?

t3_k0izks,Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) - A Stock Review/Guide - Chose this from the Comments,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. The poll is about to close out so I'll be doing the other stock reviews here soon based on the results, but anyways, Intel was one of the stocks requested in the comments by  [hhh888hhhh](https://www.reddit.com/user/hhh888hhhh/), so let's take a look.

Let's start by taking a look at the business model.

# INTC - Intel Corp:

It is one of the the world's largest and highest-valued semiconductor chip producers. Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system manufacturers, produces motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers, integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.

Intel breaks itself down into the following segments:

>**- Client Computing Group** – produces hardware used in desktop and notebook computers  
>  
>\- **Data Center Group** – produces hardware used in server, network, and storage platforms  
>  
>**- Internet of Things Group** – offers platforms designed for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings and home use  
>  
>\- **Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group** – manufactures NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint, branded as Optane, products primarily used in solid-state drives.  
>  
>\- **Intel Security Group** – produces software, particularly security, and antivirus software.  
>  
>**- Programmable Solutions Group** – manufactures programmable semiconductors.  
>  
>The YoY growth of these segments can be found [here.](https://www.intc.com/segments)

**Strengths:**

>\-  Intel’s core business has broad exposure to growing market segments, particularly:  cloud, data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.  
>  
>\-  The company is successfully migrating from a PC-centric business to a data-centric business  
>  
>\-  Intel stock is very cheap right now (P/E 8.9 November 2020), this could potentially lower the risk profile and boost rewards potential.  
>  
>\- They have been very strategic with their previous acquisitions.  
>  
>\- As we will see when we look at the financials, their books up to the start of 2020 are solid.

**Risks:**

>\-   INTC is immersed in a semiconductor market that, while having stronger long-term growth potential, is highly cyclical. Big up years are followed by big down years. This is just the result of supply/demand cycles in the market.  
>  
>\- Intel is gradually losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), and other competitors. (NOTE: AMD & NVIDIA will not be discussed here, this post is for INTC)\*\*\*  
>  
>\- Litigations. This is common for corporations this size. For intel it is mostly antitrust lawsuits.

\*\*\*Interesting note about AMD in the next section.

# Financial History:

Something that was really interesting is, after going through a bit of Intel's 10K I got curious and checked out AMD as well. Right in the very beginning AMD has this as their disclaimer:

>***Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.***  
>  
>Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.

That really says a lot about the stength Intel Corp has in this market. Incase anyone is curious, [here is the source.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248817000043/amd-12312016x10k.htm#sC2A00DC72E841F4EC97A655066A6893F) Risk Factors, page 13.

Anyways let's look into the financials over the last 10 years.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$53,999|$23,571|$10,800|0.5|
|2013|$52,708|$20,323|$16,418|0.8|
|2015|$55,355|$22,713|$25,511|1.05|
|2017|$62,761|$26,179|$34,673|1.3|
|2019|$71,965|$32,861|$33,285|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% YoY, the earnings has increase right along side this. Best has increased gradually, nearly x3 over the 10 years, but it is still only 1x the earnings. Very healthy, especially when we jump into this next section and talk about the cash flow.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|20,960|10,764|15,370|

Cash flow from operations has increased about 5% YoY over the decade, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 5% as well. $33 Billion in cash flow is pretty crazy, especially considering they still have half of that left over after Capital Expenditures. They have been using the excess cash flow to pay down some debt (\~750 Million in 2019), dividend out, and buy back shares. Over the decade the outstanding shares have decreased by 2% YoY from 5,256 to 4,417.

What is crazy is that Intel is trading at about an 8x multiplier. Their P/E puts them in a nice range for this to be a very strong value play as well, especially considering they are already well established in a sector that is growing rapidly.

# What are their plans for the future?

Intel's intentions are to establish a lead in key technologies that are fundamentally changing computing and communications today and for tomorrow.

Their priority areas for continued growth:

* Cloud Services
* IoT (Internet of Things)
* Artificial Intelligence
   * Intel is acquiring SigOpt to Scale AI Productivity (October 2020)
* 5G
* Intelligent Edge
* Autonomous Driving Technology

How they intend to deploy their capital:

* Investing into R&D to strengthen their competitive position.
* Strategically invest/acquire companies to stimulate data-centric growth.
* Return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.

# Current Dividend History:

Intel Corp has only had 6 years of Continuous Dividend Growth at this time.

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$1.32|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.81% (Based on  $47.01 Price Nov 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|\-|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|7%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.6%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|24.26%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, the payout is very low, however their growth is extremely promising given the low payout of only 24.26%, and the fact that this company produces gobs of free cash flow.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 7% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$1.41|$1.51|$1.61|$1.73|$1.85|

# Closing Thoughts:

At its current price, with the strong financials, and overall excellent business growth prospects, this stock would best be considered a really strong value play. The dividend is there and there is very strong potential for growth, however the payout is still a bit low. Now for a very long term hold, this could be an excellent entrance price, especially if they were to start increasing the dividend growth rate as they increased their cash flow.

# Introduction:

Hewlett-Packard is one of the old reliables from the tech industry. HPQ has grown their dividend for 10 years. They are most well known for their focus in personal computers, printers, and 3D printers.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

- Is there revenue growth?

- Is there earnings growth?

- Is the company really leveraged?

- Is there strong cash flow?

## Company Strengths & Risks:

Strengths:

- Very reliable increases in dividends (flattened from 2000 to 2010 then aggressively raised their dividend)

- Strong branding (170 countries, 27000 patents)

- Consistent Share buybacks

- Strong consumer demand in the WFH era benefits HPQ

- Lifespan of printers and computers seems to have increased due to the pandemic

Risks:

- Price doesnt appreciate. Price fluctuates from 10 to 22 (total return might be affected on exit)

- Still high costs due to the split of 2015

## Financial History and numbers

Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HPQ/balance-sheet?p=HPQ) as of Nov 26 2020

Current Annual Payout/Share | $0.78
-----------------------------|--------
Yield                    | 3.48%
10 Yr Div Growth Rate    | 16.29%
3 Yr Div Growth Rate     | 9.18%
1 Yr Div Growth Rate     | 9.99%
Years Of Growth          | 10
Current Payout Ratio     | 29.71
Free Cash Flow / Share   | 2.64
Revenue                  | 56.6M
Debt / Equity Ratio      | -2.79

(napkin math: 6,217,000/-2,228,000= -2.79)

HPQ has pretty healthy financials. The payout ratio is low but the negative debt to equity ratio is a red flag. HPQ claims that they are still streamlining their processes and in response to covid, they are committed to buying back shares and closing real estate locations. Consumer demand most noticeably (and predictably) increased due to COVID, so I think that post streamlining and supply chain recovery, HPQ can look good in 5-10 years.

The free cash flow year over year is increasing too. The dividend increases are outstanding. In fact, let’s project this forward to guesstimate the future payouts. (These are estimates, the actual payouts can range differently)

Year | Potential payout (based on 10.29%)
------|------------------------------------
2021 | 0.86
2022 | 0.95
2023 | 1.10
2024 | 1.27

HPQ is shown on finviz to have a 112.3% ROI. That’s some value for your risk right there. HP's [dividend history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/dividends/history) makes it all the more appealing to me.

## Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

- Is there revenue growth? Yes… kinda

- Is there earnings growth? Yes

- Is the company really leveraged? Yes (high debt)

- Is there strong cash flow? Yes

HPQ to me is an excellent speculation play for dividend growth. The company is widely recognized and has room for paying out (which they seem committed to). The dividend growth is amazing. The downside is that HP does not increase in price very well. And that negative debt to equity ratio. Therefore, I would recommend this to those aiming to preserve capital (or as a bill payoff) more than to raise capital. HPQ has the ability to continue paying and is committed to growing that dividend.

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research. [Here is HPQ's investor relation page](https://investor.hp.com/home/default.aspx).

t3_k2srtp,Walmart (NYSE: WMT) - A stock review/guide - 2nd Place Winner in the Poll,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. The poll closed out with Walmart placing 2nd and Honeywell placing last, so these two will get stock reviews, starting today with Wal-Mart.

# Walmart | Save Money - Live Better:

Sector: Consumer Defensive

Walmart is America’s largest retailer by sales, selling a variety of general merchandise and grocery items. It operates 11,300 stores in the US, which account for approx 76% of sales in fiscal 2019, with Mexico and Central America \~6%, the UK \~6%, and Canada \~4% beings  its largest external markets.

The company operates several e-commerce properties apart from its site, including Flipkart, Jet.com, and shoes.com (it also owns a roughly 10% stake in Chinese online retailer JD.com). As of 2019, e-commerce accounted for only \~5% of fiscal 2019 sales. However the e-sales growth during the pandemic has greatly increased this.

Walmart has been smart with its acquisitions and partnerships. Walmart has partnerships with Instacard, ThredUp, Shopify, and even Google. The Instacart partnership, together accounts for [nearly half](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png) of all online grocery sales. The partnership with Thredup allows Walmart to sell cheaper clothes on its online marketplace, and Shopify allows 3rd party sellers to sell their goods on Walmart's marketplace as well. Lastly, the Google partnership provides customers voice-enabled grocery shopping and likely much more in the future. Walmart's partnerships and acquisitions are taken to further complete with and provide a market alternative to Amazon.

If you want to see more of their partnership/acquisitions [please look here on page 2.](https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2019/annual/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf)

**Strengths:**

>\- Walmart is the largest retailer in the world providing it unequaled power to leverage their vendor's, suppliers, and manufacturers, keeping prices low with national and private brands.  
>  
>\- Walmart's cost advantage provides significant barrier to entry and is consistently used to disrupt their competitors.  
>  
>\- The company is aggressively investing in its e-commerce segment and focused on strategic acquisitions to complete with Amazon. (Mentioned in the last paragraph above)  
>  
>\-  The partnership with Google is has the potential to be particularly strong due to Walmart lacking strong tech exposure.  
>  
>\- Walmart PLUS memberships, 2 hour delivery, and expansion into drone delivery services.

**Risks:**

>\-  Walmart employs millions people and is facing intense pressure to raise wages. This will have an effect on their profit margins.  
>  
>\- Amazon. Amazon is much much more than just e-commerce.  
>  
>\- Walmart's profit margins aren't as wide as they could be due to keeping prices lower, this does bring them more sales revenue, but they have to be very wary of any competitors lowering their prices further to undermine Walmart's position and margins.

Amazon's threat to many of the traditional brick and mortar industries cannot be understated. Amazon's model is nearly the example of a monopsony, the opposite of a monopoly. They aren't interested in dominating one sector, but ingraining themselves into literally everything. This is why Amazon's model is so disruptive.

In addition to this, Amazon is often the company that raises the conversation of wage increases to undermine it's competitors. The [wage increase to 15$](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181002005317/en/Amazon-Raises-Minimum-Wage-to-15-for-All-U.S.-Employees-Including-Full-Time-Part-Time-Temporary-and-Seasonal) was much more than them ""listening to their critics"", it was a move to further pressure any of their competitors whose margins cannot effectively absorb this cost burden. This tactic, along with Walmarts cheap pricing tactics, is what allows Amazon to nab up companies very cheap. ([See the whole diapers deal](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-quidsi-diaperscom-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos-2020-7)).

# Financial History:

For Walmart we will be looking at the 5 year financials rather than the 10 year due to their push more recently to get into the ecommerce markets.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|$478,615|$33,559|$49,994|\~1.5|
|2017|$481,371|$32,884|$45,930|\~1.4|
|2018|$495,761|$30,966|$46,470|\~1.5|
|2019|$514,405|$32,635|$58,033|\~1.8|
|2020|$523,964|$31,555|$72,400|\~2.3|

The revenue is honestly just insane and shows how large Walmart is, plus it is something like 80-90% of the US population lives within 15 miles of a Walmart or something? Anyways, $478 Billion to $523 Billion, about an average increase of 2.2% YoY. Not bad, they are continuing to grow, but just ahead of currently inflation rates. When we look at EBITDA though, their margins are shrinking/lumpy.  This, based on the company movement, and from what they say in their 10K, this decrease is largely attributed to them moving into e-commerce. These numbers may be significantly different next year since their ecommerce has been growing pretty significantly during the pandemic, [they are estimated at 97% annual growth there](https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-ecommerce-sales-reach-sky-high-growth-in-recent-quarter-2020-8). However note that ecommerce, despite this increase is still a very small piece of the company right now, it is going to take awhile for it to have a more significant impact, but the growth is absolutely there.

The debt is increasing due to acquisitions as well as investment into the ecommerce segment as well. The 2.3x debt/earnings is a bit higher than their historic levels, but again, they are investing right now, and it is still lower than a 3x where it starts to be a bit more concerning.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|$28,337|$10,051|$16,840|
|2019|$27,753|$10,344|$29,444|
|2020|$25,255|$10,705|$13,479|

Cash flow from operations is definitely in line with the decreasing EBITDA so that makes sense. Their CAPEX been consistent the last few years, nothing to really note there since the e-market stuff has already been mentioned. Now for the Free Cash Flow, in 2019 there is a significant jump, this is because in 2019 they took on \~$12 Billion in debt load, this was added to the FCF/E for whatever reason, we can subtract it and say that is was more likely \~$15/16/17 Billion, which is in line with the decline. In 2018 and 2020 they were making debt payments, appears to be about 1.5 Billion for each of those years, hence the lower FCF/E there.

Over the years, in addition to the dividend, they do appear to be using some of their capital to buy back shares, those have decreased from approx 3,200 - 2,850 outstanding over the last 5 years or so. Some would say this is the better way to give back to the shareholders rather than dividends, but others say that it is a way for companies to create synthetic earnings. Take what you will from that. Typically healthy (large) companies will do both dividends and share buybacks, so take what you will from that.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

Walmart (WMT) is a Dividend Aristocrat that has paid and increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$151.60|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|21.89|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.16|
|Yield|1.42% (Based on  $151.60 Price Nov 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|7.2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|1.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|34.45%|

Strictly from a Dividend Growth perspective, the payout is a bit low and the dividend growth has sharply decreased as the company continues to focus on e-market expansion. In addition to this, the yield on cost is of lower value right now, had the stock been purchased earlier when it's price was closer to 100$, it would have been an excellent buy, at the current price and yield though, there are better prospects.

From a value perspective... well Walmart over the years has traded closer to an 8x multiple, it is currently over 20x. Based on this alone it would be considered overvalued based on its financials, however one also needs to consider that higher multiples are typically paid for companies with stronger growth prospects...which leads us to growth.

From a growth perspective, Walmart is a market titan, the growth will be gradual over longer periods of time, but there are many factors that need to be considered from this perspective (as well as the others):

>\- Will their e-market investments pay off or will they lose market share due to more competitors in the business and pressure from Amazon?  
>  
>\- Will the decline of brick and mortar stores offset the earnings from the e-market?  
>  
>\- How much could they expand their margins by automating warehouses amoung other segments?  
>  
>\- Do their traditional brick and mortar stores provide Walmart a significant distribution advantage over Amazon? (80-90% of Americans within 15 miles of a Walmart mentioned above)  
>  
>\- How will Wamart continue to nurture their relationships with Google and Microsoft and will it continue to make smart and strategic acquisitions?  
>  
>\- How will future government policies and labor unions affect both Amazon and Walmart?

There are so many different unknowns that need to be considered.

# Closing Thoughts:

Walmart is an absolute titan of a company that is transitioning to have a significant e-market presence. Compared to Amazon, Walmart is currently the underdog that still needs to be very cognizant of it's other competitors, like Target. However, their recent partnerships and acquisitions have enabled the company to expand significantly online during the pandemic, and unlike Amazon, they have a wider physicals presence, stores that can act as distribution centers amoung other things.

Ultimately, Amazon is very likely to continue to dominate, however, Walmart does have the potential to start edging their way into the different market segments and start taking pieces of the pie for itself. Amazon is certainly aware of this, hence the reason it pushes timely wage-increases and other policies to undermine its competitors. Government policy is a significant factor to both due to their sheer size and presence.

At the end of it all, you need to ask yourself, do you think Walmart can continue compete, and continue to work its current business model? Or perhaps you'd take more the side of why not both?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. There are always more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views, read up on Target and Amazon. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

While I think it’s better than not contributing to retirement at all, expenses do really start eating up into your compounds.*

Taxable: 75% IVV (SP 500) yielding 1.94%, 20% QQQ (Nasdaq 100) yielding 0.61%, 5% WSB yielding ???. Bonuses: Apple yielding 0.70% and PepsiCo yielding 2.83%. *Note: I prefer IVV over VOO simply because of its higher dividend yield of 1.94% compared to 1.78%. I guess if you look at it, it’s also a way to diversify between my taxable and retirement accounts. You definitely don’t want to put all your eggs in one company. Now with that being said, I also have 20% in QQQ. Contrarily to what you may have heard, QQQ isn’t a pure tech fund. It simply tracks the top 100 non-financial companies in the Nasdaq. It just so happens that tech is the big player here, it’s sector and holdings will be adjusted accordingly. It has the aggression I’m looking for despite having overlaps between IVV. I also use 5% to scratch that itch on making those “plays” with day trading and options. This is money I can afford to lose. I understand the risks and what I’m getting myself into. Outside the core of my portfolio, any bonuses or additional income I get from side hustles I use that to build positions for fun to feel “involved” in the market. As you can see I don’t hold many individual companies. Not many companies beat the market in the long run but its okay to support companies you actually like. My only requirements are I have to actually like the company so much that I’ll be able to commit to investing a minimum of 10K and it has to have a dividend. So far I only have two companies in my project but I have my eye on a few companies such as Chase.

Edit: This is a collective breakdown of all my accounts as one. I have everything set up to reinvest and don’t really keep track of dividends. I would say it’s around $4K-$5K yearly if I had to give an estimate.",26,0.87,1606780588.0

The plan is at the end of each month I will post the list of users who received permanent bans in the previous month. The next list should be published December 31st.

The purpose of this exercise is to be open about who moderators are banning and to ensure there is no abuse of the system. There are many subs where mods ban anyone who disagrees with them. I would not like that to happen here. By forcing mods to justify who they ban, it prevents the possibility of abuse.

It is the belief of the moderation team that clearly set guidelines will pave the way for productive conversations.

I have a couple stocks that I've gotten like a 42% return on and would love to watch them grow more, however they pay nothing in dividends. 2) How many is too many? Is it better to dump a lot of money into say 5 dividend stocks or a little money into 20? I know that diversification is important, but I also feel like most if not all the high dividend stocks I own are solid AF and not going anywhere anytime soon, so should I try to buy as much of those as possible to increase my dividend potential or keep it spread out?

2. Are you investing for dividends inside a taxable account and if so why?

t3_k4b6ic,STAG and Their Stagnant Dividend,"I encountered an opinion today I don't usually see. Stag Industrial's equity price has enjoyed a lovely increase over the years for an industrial REIT. Really pretty impressive for a company in their sub-sector. They do seem to check all the boxes for a lot of us: monthly dividend, industrial focus, trying to be e-commerce resistant *and/or* embrace e-commerce distribution centers. Apparently Ben Butcher is also respected as being very good at acquisitions. Yet, the dividend grows within a fraction of a fraction of a penny over years. Dividends are a policy decision... they do not necessarily reflect on a company's growth plan.

So, the company is growing fundamentals. FFO growth is steady. They issue shares accretively. The actual dividend paid shows nil growth. 

What are your bull cases on STAG? If they didn't pay monthly, would you still be invested? Do you approve of their policy of keeping dividend increases minimal? Do you think this will be a 60 (or 50, or 40) dollar stock in 5 to 7 years or grow their dividend in a meaningful way?

Edit: for what it's worth I'm bullish on the company and it is the one I am currently building a full position in. They recently offered another share offering with a price of around 30.40 a share based on the 8 million share offering with an additional 1.2 million shares to be potentially sold.

#**Sector and Industry**

Garmin Ltd. operates in the technology sector under the scientific & technical instruments industry. The industry has seen [appreciated 21.33%](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) in the past year. Garmin has slightly outperformed this growth with [23.61% share price appreciation]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN) in the past year. Annual industry earnings growth is [at 7.22% for the last five years]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) with Garmin significantly outperforming at [21.60% in the same time period](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN).

Garmin is the [second largest scientific & technical instruments company](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=ind_scientifictechnicalinstruments&o=-marketcap) by market cap, second only to [Fortive Corporation](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTV). GRMN’s market cap [currently sits at $22.78B]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN). Garmin makes up around 14% of the industry’s [$168.06B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name).

#**The Company**

Garmin Ltd. offers products in [five main categories](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/profile?p=GRMN): automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. In 2019, revenues were split between the segments as follows:

Segment|Revenue
:--|:--
Fitness|28%
Outdoor|24%
Aviation|20%
Auto|15%
Marine|13%

The COVID-19 pandemic was a positive catalyst in Garmin’s marine, outdoor, and fitness categories. Overall, the Company experience a 19% increase in third quarter 2020 revenue, quarter-over-quarter. This is exceptional growth, especially considering Garmin’s exposure to aviation.

As of the Company’s [third quarter 2020 earnings call](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf), marine revenues increased 54% quarter-over-quarter on increased consumer interest in boating and fishing. Garmin’s fitness segment saw a 35% increase in revenue from its wearable and cycling products. Notable, Garmin recently launched the [Venu Sq smartwatch](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/707174). The Company’s outdoor segment saw revenue increases of 30% with strong sales increases for the [adventure watches](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/outdoor_recreation/adventure-watches/c12520-c16900-p1.html) product line.

Garmin did see decreased revenues it its automotive and aviation operations due to the affects of COVID-19. Automotive revenues decreased 6% in third quarter 2020, compared with the same quarter in 2019. The Company has introduced several exciting new automotive products, including Garmin Catalyst: “[an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf).” In the same quarter, the Company became a Tier 1 supplier for BMW automobiles.

The Company’s aviation segment suffered revenue decreases of 19% due to COVID-19. The Company does not manufacture or sell aircraft itself. However, Garmin does expect aviation sales to fall a further 17%. Increases in owner flown aircraft will help to mitigate some losses. One of Garmin’s most exciting products in the segment is its Autoland technology.

#**Autoland**

Garmin’s Autoland is “[taking the next step towards autonomous flight](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/)” by allowing aircraft to be autonomously landed through a single button press. The Autoland system considers environmental factors, chooses a viable airport, communicates with ATC, and then lands the aircraft on an available runway—all while providing updates to passengers. These updates include location, fuel, destination airport, and arrival time. Garmin’s research into autonomous landing may remind investors of Tesla, which is developing self-driving capabilities. Garmin’s Autoland should not be underestimated—it could become the base for full autonomous flight.

Autoland can only currently be used in emergency situations where the pilot is not capable of landing the aircraft. “Autoland directs the aircraft to a suitable airport nearby for landing based upon a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, weather, terrain, approach, runway and aircraft suitability.”
In third quarter 2020, the FAA certified Autoland for [use on the Cirrus Vision Jet](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/), adding to its previous certifications for the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940.

I spoke with a pilot regarding the Autoland technology. He “expects Garmin's new automatic landing systems will be found in most general aviation TAAs [technically advanced aircraft], in the next decade.” Many pilots around the world share that sentiment, especially during a time of great advancements in autonomous vehicles.

*In thousands of USD; from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/financials?p=GRMN).

Garmin has seen consistent revenue growth in the past five years but the earnings growth is even more impressive at [21.60% annual EPS growth](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company’s consistent EPS growth is indicative of its quality management and sustainability. The earnings growth has been priced into the share price at a [PEG of 3.23](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN). It should also be noted that free cash flows have fallen year-over-year amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company remains fiscally healthy with [just $58.42M in debt and cash of $1.65B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN).

Ticker|GRMN
:--|:--
Price|$118.48
Market Cap|$22.78B
P/E|22.51
PEG|3.23
P/S|5.70
Dividend|2.04%

Still, the Company is fundamentally solid and will likely continue to grow. Garmin currently pays a [dividend of $2.44 per share, which is 2.04% of its share price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company has increased its dividend payout in the [past eight consecutive years](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GRMN/garmin/dividend-yield-history); this makes it a good candidate for dividend growth investors. Garmin will become a dividend champion in the likely case that its payout increases the next two years.

#**Conclusion**

Garmin has seen immense growth in its marine, outdoor, and fitness segments. The Company’s investments in its Autoland product have put it at the forefront of autonomous flying. Garmin is a clear innovator in its industry and will likely continue to outperform the overall market.

I personally believe Garmin’s investments in autonomous flight will make it a leader in the industry, much like Tesla has become in automotive self-driving.

t3_k5gr2l,Pretty big deal overhaul of the subreddit rules,"Good afternoon r/dividends,

As this subreddit has continued to grow, evolve, and mature, I have increasingly noticed that us moderators have become limited by the rules.  Not in their existence, but in their descriptions.  I have begun to notice posts created by honest, longtime, good faith users that were bordering on the line between acceptable and unacceptable content.  Even some posts that we moderators would deem as unacceptable, but could be loosely interpreted as acceptable if one was not aware of a rule's context.

To rectify this conundrum, I have rewritten the rules to better reflect how the moderation team is **actually** moderating content on this subreddit.  This is not me creating new rules out of thin air, but instead expanding on the rules that already exist.  Clarifying them, and making them easier to understand by drawing a giant metaphorical line between what is acceptable and what is not.  If you did not feel this change was necessary, that is good, because it means we moderators have been successful in keeping this rule-breaking content out of view.  So thank you, it really means a lot.

If you look at the sidebar, or visit [https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/about/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/about/rules), you will notice things look very different, but simultaneously familiar.  In this post, I intend to walk you through every single change that has been made. (Note: I did use r/personalfinance as inspiration for rewriting the rules.  However, there are several key distinctions (most notably is that we allow meta content here).  Enough that while the rules have a similar format, having a thorough understand of r/personalfinance's rules would not be a substitute for understanding the rules of r/dividends.

With that out of the way, let's begin:

&#x200B;

>**Rule 1: Submission guidelines**  
>  
>Posts must be a dividend question or discussion with a descriptive title. General investment, brokerage, or financial discussion is also allowed but subject to a higher bar of quality.  
>  
>We do not allow:  
>  
>  
>  
>\- Hypothetical or improbable questions  
>  
>\- News or information without a discussion or summary  
>  
>\- Links without context  
>  
>\- Open ended questions, surveys, or polls without context.  
>  
>\- Portfolio Reviews (use weekly stickied Megathread)  
>  
>\- NSFW material  
>  
>\- Questions already answered by the wiki

This rule is an encapsulation of all the things that if any moderator sees in your submission, it will be removed without a second thought.  These items have been the justifications used for removals for a long time, but they used to fall under the umbrella of a bunch of different rules.  It was just easier on our end to combine these.

&#x200B;

>**Rule 2: Self-promotional advertising or solicitation**  
>  
>We do not allow:  
>  
>  
>  
>\- Promotion of web content, products, services, companies, or anything else owned by you (or anyone affiliated with you), even if not monetized.  
>  
>\- Offering referral, invite, or affiliate links/codes.  
>  
>\- PM/DM requests or offers.  
>  
>\- Soliciting business/investors, media requests, or recruiting.  
>  
>Requires pre-approval: Customer service replies, and open-sourced tools.

This is the successor to the old Rule 1.  It clarifies our stance on self-promotion.  The rule also absorbs the old rule 6, which prohibited referral links.  It codifies the prohibition on PM/DM requests, as well as solicitation.  A reminder that broker generated links to share one's portfolio do not count as referral links.

Now, let's say you are the official account for some product or service, and someone posts about how they had a horrible experience or whatever with your product.  If you want to reply publicly to the OP in your account's official capacity, then you must seek moderator approval.  Attempting to turn a customer service reply into a self-promotion opportunity will be met with a ban.

Now let's say you are developing some independent, open-sourced dividend tracker or whatever and you want to discuss it with the community.  Reach out via modmail and we will address those on a case by case basis.  Just because you are not monetizing it does not make it exempt from our rules.

&#x200B;

>**Rule 3: Unhelpful or disrespectful**  
>  
>We do not allow:  
>  
>  
>  
>\- Directly insulting other users  
>  
>\- Insincerity or dishonesty  
>  
>\- Trolling, loaded questions, loaded language, or provoking unproductive conversation.  
>  
>\- Novelty accounts that post ""in character""  
>  
>\- Posting purely for upvotes  
>  
>\- Excessive large, bold, or spaced-out text  
>  
>\- Requesting votes/fewer votes  
>  
>\- Excessive profanity  
>  
>\- Overly political discussions  
>  
>\- Petitions or calls to action  
>  
>- [Poor redditquette](https://bit.ly/2vKxaO6)

Everything here should be pretty self explanatory.  All of it was already prohibited.  I do not think I really need to explain anything here.  This is an investing subreddit, not one based around politics.  This is also a subreddit dedicated to kindness and respect, not insults and arguments.

&#x200B;

>**Rule 4: Solicitations for due diligence**  
>  
>We do not allow:  
>  
>  
>  
>\- Asking another user to research a company, security, or other investment for you.  
>  
>\- Requesting due diligence be done on your behalf.  
>  
>\- Asking for privately prepared market research conducted by a third party.  
>  
>\- Offering to conduct due diligence in exchange for any form of compensation.

Some people find this rule incredibly difficult to follow.  Some users do not seem to understand this rule exists.  Some users are under the impression that ETFs were somehow exempt from the old Rule 4.  Some users were unaware that it is expected users of r/dividends conduct their own due diligence prior to purchasing any security.  With these thoughts in mind, I rewrote rule 4 to be more comprehensive, and to clarify.

&#x200B;

>**Rule 5: Lawbreaking information**  
>  
>We do not allow:  
>

If you create a post whose sole content is a URL link to an image, you are not clever.  It will be removed.  Clickbait titles should be obvious what those are.  Google's autocorrect does not seem to recognize what insubstantive means, so to avoid any confusion, according to a Google search, insubstantive is an Adjective meaning ""Unable to be substantiated; unfounded.""  So no objectively fake news like ""Warren Buffet died three days ago.""  If you cannot prove it, then do not say it.

t3_k6wrfk,100 Dividend Stock Portfolio,"Hello Reddit,


I've just recently gotten into investing for the first time into the stock market, I plan on being a dividend investor for the rest of my life (I'm 19) and I've so far made over 4% return, all my stocks are growing and I'm excited to receive my eventual first dividend payment. However, my question to the Reddit world is:


Is it better for me to invest my next paycheck into a set pie-chart/s of 50-100 stocks I've made on Trading 212, which are full of hand-picked, hand-researched BDC's REITs and dividend stocks, with a mixture of risk, dividend yield, 2021 predictions and growth potential, across all sectors..

or

Should I take one of those pie-charts, split it down into sectors, and invest in way less than 50 stocks?


I understand Warren Buffet and others say more than 20 stocks is pointless - but I've got my entire life ahead of me, so surely if I start a pure dividend portfolio, with some ETFs and growth stocks thrown in, I will do okay? I'm not looking to day-trade, I am joining the military as we speak, and would very much like to invest my wage every month and forget about it and let it grow. I have to serve 4 years - and the salary is 20k per year, of which most will be dumped into said pie-charts and ETFs.

So, baring in mind I'm 19 with decades ahead to invest, what do you guys think is best?",9,0.77,1607126389.0

Reading this sub and other sources however raised some questions about the strategy I will use.

Basically, most people here say it's better to invest in blue chip companies with a long history of growing dividend, however currently these companies have a 2-3% dividend yield (or even less: walmart\*). Why are these better compared to 5-6% dividend companies? There are quite a few good companies, specially in Europe, (nordea, telia etc.) which have a good track record of dividends.

I understand that with growing dividend if you buy it now for 100$ with 3% dividend, in5  years it could go up to 5% yield compared to your purchasing price, but with a 5-6% dividend stock the growing part is that you get higher dividends from the start which you can reinvest and let it compound. Is there any mathematical proof, or just looking at 2 portofolios like this for several years and compare them that could show that the 2-3% growing dividend stocks are better?

t3_k7c5ch,Leverage of dividend portfolio,"Ive been wondering lately, if it makes sense to leverage a dividend portfolio. If the interest + principal payment on the loan is lower or equal to the amount of dividends you collect, it seems to me like its pretty much ""free money"". It allows you to get a lump sum immediately, which makes the compounding effect more effective, than if you had to wait and save up that money. Of course there is additional risk (no such thing as truly free money), but if the leverage is so low that the dividends can cover the payments, i honestly dont see that much added risk.

If you leverage a growth portfolio, you will have to contribute more money to the portfolio each month, in order to pay back the loan. But with a dividend portfolio, if you are in the accumulation stage, i just dont see why not do it?

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?",4,0.75,1607191045.0
t3_k7bo0a,Broadstone Net Lease & UPREIT Structure,"Broadstone performed pretty well when it was private and recently underwent its initial public offering. From what I can see, it tends to focus on restaurants and some healthcare offices. Loads of Taco Bells (which I find a plus!). It offers a nice yield over 5% at the moment and trades at a low multiple of 7. 

Main concern would be its Red Lobster locations. I don't know enough about those bankruptcy proceedings to comment further. Broadstone is considered diversified, but when you look at its state by state holdings, it looks more and more like a restaurant REIT. It's not, but it looks like it is. 

Its structure is a little strange to me. It may actually be more normal than I think, but the way they spell it out is rather up front. Does anyone know anything about UPREIT structure or OP units? I wouldn't qualify of course since I'm not a millionaire and I think their website reminds of when it was private rather than public... The REIT shares are still easily liquid to the rest of us but they really seem to go about investor relations differently than most.

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone has opinions on BNL. I may have asked about it before, but that was before I was aware of the problems with Red Lobster. Its low multiple suggests risk, yet they're offering the same dividend from before they went public / prior to covid and could easily offer great equity returns once the virus is mitigated. I noted several executives went to the Simon Graduate School of Business for their MBA degrees, which is a plus considering I recently learned Realty Income's CEO went to my alma mater UChicago... and management matters as much as assets, sometimes.",2,0.75,1607189550.0
t3_k7au1c,Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) - A stock guide/review,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. This is the last stock review for the first poll that closed out last week. The current poll just closed and it looks like AT&T took it. So that will be next.

# Honeywell International:

Sector: Industrials

Honeywell operates as a diversified technology and manufacturing company worldwide. It breaks itself down into the following segments:

* Aerospace segment:

>Offers auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, integrated avionics, environmental control and electric power systems, engine controls, flight safety, communications, navigation hardware, data and software applications, radar and surveillance systems, aircraft lighting, advanced systems and instruments, satellite and space components, and aircraft wheels and brakes; spare parts; repair, overhaul, and maintenance services; thermal systems; and connected solutions and data services for the aftermarket, as well as wireless connectivity, and management and technical services.

* Building Technologies segment:

>offers advanced software applications for building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for energy management; access control; video surveillance; fire products; remote patient monitoring systems; e-cooling heat transfer agents; and installation, maintenance, and upgrades of systems.

* Performance Materials and Technologies segment:

>offers automation control, instrumentation, and advanced software and related services; catalysts and adsorbents, equipment, and consulting; and materials used to manufacture end products, such as bullet-resistant armor, nylon, computer chips, and pharmaceutical packaging, as well as Honeywell forge connected solutions.

>\- Automation of activities has enabled the company to scale up/down production based on the demand conditions in the market.  
>  
>\- Strong Free Cash Flow.  
>  
>\- Decent Returns on Capital Expenditure and mergers + acquisitions.

**Risks:**

>\- Honeywell International needs to put more money in technology investments to maintain relevancy and innovation edge.  
>  
>\- The company has lost market share in many categories listed above due to strong competition and companies undercutting prices.  
>  
>\- Investment in R&D is below the fastest growing players in the industry.  
>  
>\- Industrials are highly cyclical.  
>  
>\- Honeywell is more subject to fluctuations in the US gov defense budget. (This has been stable, however that is not to say that won't change in the future)

# Financial History:

This next section will include information up to their 2019 yearly 10k. However, for 2020 (based on their quarterlies) they definitely haven't been doing terrible. The Space and Building segments are definitely down, however the Safety and Productions segment has helped buffer the loss during the market downturn. So the diversification into multiple industrial segments has definitely helped them. They have been doing so well over the last decade, in fact, [they were reintroduced to the DOW Jones](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-dow/salesforce-amgen-honeywell-to-join-dow-jones-industrial-idUSKBN25K2J9) in August. (They were previously removed in 2008).

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$36,529|$3,531|$6,896|2|
|2013|$39,055|$6,490|$7,441|1.1|
|2015|$38,581|$7,711|$6,113|0.85|
|2017|$40,534|$8,314|$13,924|1.7|
|2019\*\*\*|$36,709|$8,592|$13,191|1.5|

Looking here it would seem they have decreasing revenue between 2017-2019, however the decrease there is actually because they sold their Transportations Systems portion of the Aerospace segment into a standalone publicly-traded company (Garrett Motion Inc.), and also part of the Building Technologies to a public company (Residio Technologies Inc), so the decrease in revenue is attributed to those sales. ([Item 7 of the most recent 10K, page 17](https://investor.honeywell.com/Cache/IRCache/09f14eba-f828-c545-c341-6b1f333ff270.pdf)). So if we account for this then Honeywell has definitely been growing revenue over the decade. This can be seen in the earnings which have increased on average 11% YoY.

Debt has doubled, but considering the increase in earnings and revenue, and the low debt to begin with, it isn't too notable. The Debt/EBITDA ratio here is only about 1.5, so they are definitely not too leveraged. Note, the debt calculations above are short term + long term debt.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$2,830|$789 Million|$2,453|
|2015|$5,519|$1,073|$3,626|
|2019|$6,897|$838 Million|$5,880|

Cash flow lines up with with earnings, even accounting for the spin outs mentioned above. The CAPEX is pretty low, it does mean they are generating very good sums of money with the investments they are making, but Honeywell needs to ensure it is investing to maintain competitiveness. Free cash flow is very strong. Based on their sheets, in addition to the dividend, they are  using some of this to buy back some shares, 773 to 715 from 2011 to 2019.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

Honeywell is a Dividend Achiever that has paid and increased its dividend for 10 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$208.22|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|29.91|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$3.72|
|Yield|1.79% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|10.8%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.1%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|10%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|48.06%|

This will be broken this down from a dividend perspective, and then a value perspective. The dividend growth for the company has been fantastic, consistently at 10% over the entire decade that hasn't slowed down, plus the payout ratio is a low 48%. Based on their free cash flow this is quite sustainable moving into the future. The CEO has mentioned plans to shift the dividend growth to match growth in earnings (Averaged at \~5%), so this could potentially increase/decrease the growth rate based on those numbers.  From a value perspective however, the price of \~208$ is expensive, and some would say overvalued. Because of it's price, the yield is a low 1.79%. Based on the dividend alone the stock would have been more of a fair value when it was priced closer to 150/160$ (Yield \~2.4%). however there are some arguments against this.

Honeywell has been moving to a more subscription based service with its products, this model has a tendency sharply increase revenue for successful companies with worthwhile products and often causes them to trade at higher P/E and books ratios. In addition to this they are also partnering with Microsoft for cloud services. According to their CEO, Honeywell is aiming to become more of a controls company, using software across industries to control the flow of data. This move and partnerships support the higher price tag for the stock and helps explain why they are trading at a higher ratio, much like tech companies do.

# Closing Thoughts:

All in all, Honeywell is a well run company, they have strong financials, decent diversification, and competent leadership. Whether of not you feel the price is a good entry point depends on whether or not you believe the company should be trading at more a premium based on its financials, products, and future goals. Some would say the rally from \~$104 - $208 (March 2020 - Dec 2020) caps its short term potential and increases its downside.  That said, the company's aerospace segments look strong, and management has a clear pathway to growth through its digital and IoT initiatives.

If you're not sure but you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, pease supplement this with your own research. There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

t3_k70z3t,Dividend CCC List - 725 Stocks Culled Down To 31! - Need Advice,"\*\*The link to the screenshot of my culled list & to the Dividend CCC list that is updated by Justin Law every month is on the 1st comment. Links posted cause issues with rejected posts.

I played with the full Dividend Champion - Challenger - Contender list for the last couple days. I'm a fairly ""young"" investor as I still have a bit of time in the market so most of my portfolio is situated around high growth stocks/ETFs but I will have a good chunk of SCHD & DGRW/DGRO for long term dividend growth. I figured I would see if there would be some good opportunities for myself but mainly for my father in law though. He's recently retired and has some money to put into a dividend portfolio.

**Starting Metrics** \- Anything that did NOT meet that standard I culled.

\- *3-6% Dividend Yield* (Most are fairly ""safe"" within this range and safe/long term dividend income was the goal).

\- I gave a little leeway for COVID so I culled anything that hadn't had a dividend ""increased"" since Sept 2019.

\- Looked for an increase in Dividend Growth when comparing 5yr&10yr dividend growth (%) - ""5yr/10yr Accel/Decel"" - I wanted this to be as close to 1.00 or higher. I gave a little leeway so set at 0.80 Ratio

\- Minimal 2-Billion Market Cap (sounded good and wanted legitimately large companies)

\- At least 4-Payouts / yr (Quarterly or Monthly Payers Only)

\- >/= 10% Stock Price Growth (5y Chart on Robinhood/Seeking Alpha) - Anything lower was culled.

&#x200B;

I ended up with a list of 31x Dividend Growth stocks that actually have some share appreciation. I color coded the stocks with 2x shades of green. The darker green shaded stocks actually have >30% share price appreciation over 5yrs. Then I started just going through each thing I knew how to somewhat interpret on the excel sheet and cull things at random. I looked for a minimal goal and then shaded that light green and darker green with things I felt were ""good""/""better"".I'd love to hear your thoughts on these 31x stocks. Interested to know if I am on my way to helping him out in a meaningful way and not misleading him. I also left a lot of the EPS and EPS growth and a ton of other things in there. I know some sectors you can evaluate them one way or another but with some they are going to be fairly different. I will say, looking at the PEG though, you can tell that we've had some record highs going on. A lot of those are priced pretty overvalued at the moment. Unfortunately I think that's just how it's going to stay going forward (with the exception of this December sell off that is most likely going to happen with the volatility of TSLA finally getting into the S&P 500 on the 21. Look out for some good deals within a few days after that!

t3_k6yb5j,Company issuing notes to pay debt?,"Getty Realty, which mostly focuses on gas station real estate, is issuing 175 million in senior unsecured notes. I understand that is very different than issuing equity at an accretive pace how Stag Industrial recently did (buy that dip folks). But I read Getty's issuance was used to pay for their debt due in 2021. So they're basically issuing debt at 3.43% to pay down their maturing 6% debt. Issuing cheap debt to fund more expensive debt.

So is this a good idea? It seems both weird to me and beneficial at the same time. Lots of REITs issue equity at good prices, but I supposed it wouldn't make sense for Getty to do so at depressed share price levels. Also, they're issuing unsecured notes... which I admit, I do not quite understand what notes are.

The smoking volume is declining, but pricing power has been strong. If we get inflation, then pricing power will be very important for any company people invest in. As far as counteracting decline in smoking other than price increases then there is the heated tobacco, marijuana, and nicotine products (pouches, etc). None of these markets existed 17 years ago when cig use was also declining.

The dividends seems incredibly safe, in general debt is not too burdensome (5-8x cashflow), and the market is stable with some potential for growth. The biggest risk, and it is a real risk, is governments will harshly increase excise taxes on cigs to raise revenue especially after all the pandemic spending.

T (7.92% of my portfolio), KO (16.05%), AAPL (14.94%), XLE (12.13%), XLF (2.16%), ET (5.71%), FFIC (16.28%)

O (2.95%), & STAG (6.66%)

I also have a few others just to capture some growth, but those aren't important for this. 

I know that there is nothing particularly spectacular about monthly dividend payers compared to quarterly, but I'd still like to increase my monthly dividend income.  I think that if I buy into another REIT, 1 etf, and maybe get into some municipal bonds I'll be happy.

O Realty & Stag.  I own a very small amount of O Realty, but I definitely plan on adding more through dollar cost averaging over the next few months (that'll have to be my strategy, I'm a college student with a part time job, I wouldn't be able to dump a large amount in lol).  

I just bought into STAG and will receive my first dividend from them this month.  I really like both of these, and plan on holding them forever and building up a large position.  When it comes to my third REIT, I have no idea where to go.  A lot of people I've talked with are pumped up about WP Carey, but I'm not 100% sure (someone change my mind?) and I think I missed out on the massive spike SPG saw this month, so I'm not sure I want to buy in now, and I'm not sure I'd want to buy in period.  Does anyone have a REIT that they are super confident in?  Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Monthly Dividend ETF  
Alright, you guys already know what I'm about to say.  SPHD.  I've seen some hate towards SPHD from this crowd, but I think I like it.  Anyone have a different Dividend ETF they like?  Preferably it's a monthly payer, but I'd be fine with something else as long as there is a solid upside.

Now, I've looked at MHI and I love it.  Monthly dividend payer that yields 4.63%.  Income tax FREE, baby. What do y'all think about me purchasing about 1-3 shares of MHI every paycheck (so anywhere from 2-6 per month) of MHI to slowly but surely increase my position size and increase my monthly dividend income?

t3_k7k8j2,AT&T (NYSE: T) - A stock Guide/Review - Poll winner - Long Post,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. AT&T won over ABBV and PG in the latest poll. There is a lot to unpack with this stock and it is definitely more controversial, especially in regards to it's debt. Let's take a look at everything it does, the financials, and a quick look at its investments/acquisitions. The dividend and possible growth with also be discussed. 

# AT&T - American Telephone and Telegraph:

**Sector: Communication Services** 

AT&T is a diversified global leader in telecommunications, media and entertainment, and technology. It operates four segments: 

* AT&T Communications: 

>AT&T Communications serves +100 million with TV, mobile and broadband services. In addition, it provides internet to more than 3 million business customers.

* AT&T International:

>AT&T International provides TV and wireless services to consumers and businesses in over 11 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

* AT&T ad and analytics:

>Ad and analytics provides marketers with targeted, data-driven advertising focused around premium video content.

* Warner Media’s HBO & Turner and Warner Bros divisions:

>Warner Media’s HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. are leaders in creating content and operating the world’s largest TV and film studio.

**Strengths:**

>\- Acquisitions have added to AT&T’s economic moat,  increased revenues, increased ability to bundle services (synergies that enable cost cutting).   
>  
>\- Billions of dollars in capital expenditures and company investments (over 170 billion the last 5 years).   
>  
>\- The company merger with Time Warner will allow it to squeeze its way into the lucrative streaming market. Having one of the world’s largest content creators combined with AT&T’s services could be powerful. (This will be discussed further below)

**Risks:**

>\- Lots of debt. This company is quite leveraged. The Time-Warner merger increases AT&T’s debt to the point the company balance sheet should be watched intensely.   
>  
>\- AT&T is largely concentrated in the US right now.   
>  
>\- Intense competition from Verizon and other telecom giants. 

# Financial History:

Before diving into the financials AT&Ts goals need to be discussed. Recently they appointed a new president for the company, their stated goals include bringing down their overall debt, increasing their earnings and cash flow through the HBO and Warner acquisitions, remaining committed to the dividend, and the sale of underperforming assets to streamline capital investments. 

This first chart will break down their Revenue, Earnings, Debt, and Debt Ratio over the decade. The source of the information is the company 10K SEC filings. 

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Short + Long Term Debt|Debt / EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$126,723|$32,443|$65,573|2|
|2013|$128,752|$47,005|$75,293|1.5|
|2015|$146,801|$45,551|$129,613|2.8|
|2017|$160,546|$45,572|$165,665|3.6|
|2019|$181,190|$56,172|$191,680|2.9|

Revenue as increased 5% YoY, it is pretty solid, for a company this large that has been around for as long as it has double digit growth is definitely not expected. Earnings has increased \~9% YoY over the decade, outpacing the revenue, this is nice since it is increasing their margins. 

Debt has definitely grown at a significant pace, this is largely based off their acquisitions over the recent years. Back in 2015 they acquired Direct TV (gross), and in 2018 Time Warner + HBO. In both 2015 and 2017 you can see the spike in the debt to EBITDA levels above the 3x we would normally like to see, however AT&T has stated they are committed to reducing their debt levels, their stated objective is to bring debt/EDITDA below 2.5x. Already we can see at the end of 2019 that they have managed to bring the ratio down to 2.9, which is a good trend, something that, based on their quarterly earnings this year, they have been continuing. 

Let's take a closer look at the cash flow, and their debt payments.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|Debt Payment / Influx|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$34,743|$20,272|$14,833|\+362 Million|
|2013|$34,796|$21,228|$22,706|\+9,138 Billion|
|2015|$35,880|$20,015|$39,792|\+23,927 Billion|
|2017|$38,010|$21,550|$52,342|\+35,882 Billion|
|2018|$43,602|$21,251|$11,023|\-11,328 Billion|
|2019|$48,660|$19,635|$15,430|\-13,603 Billion|

Net cash flow is very strong and growing \~4% average. Their CAPEX line has been steady, but note that it does not include the cost of any mergers, acquisitions or purchases.

Now, the Free Cash Flow to Equity is looking really weird in 2015 and 2017, the reason there is such a spike in FCF/E is because those are the years AT&T loaded up on new debt, note the spike in Long Term Debt in the previous chart, the influx of cash from those loans is simply being added to the FCF/E here.  If they are subtracted the ratio more in line with the $15 Billion they have averaged. 

Lastly, the debt payments. After the acquisitions, we can see that in 2018 and 2019 they have been making substantial debt payments. Based on the recent quarterly earning they have continued to pay down the debt load.

So, thus far we have seen increasing revenues and earnings, strong free cash flow, and an increase in debt repayments. Good trends, yes the company is still leveraged, but not as leveraged as some other companies we have recently looked at (Looking at you IBM - they are currently approx 4x debt/EBITDA)

Anyways, let's now take a look at the acquisitions before discussing the dividend. 

# Direct TV:

AT&T acquired DirectTV in 2015 for \~$67 Billion dollars. Since then (and even before the acquisition), It has YoY decreasing profits as more and more people move away from traditional expensive cable in favor of streaming. Already they are looking to action off Direct TV, with optimistic guesses it'll likely sell for around $20B Billion. There is no doubt that this was an absolute failure and questionable decision, even in 2015, given the trends. This is one of the largest factors causing the former CEO Stephenson to be replaced. 

Selling Direct TV would allow AT&T to continue off-loading legacy, and capital intensive segments to boost free cash flow to focus on growth of more profitable (and not declining) company segments. It does come with a stinging loss of over $40 Billion just from the sale alone. The new CEO, Stankey, seems more than ready to just offload Direct TV, use the cash to invest back into the company, and move on. 

# Time Warner (Warner Media) and HBO: 

These acquisitions were incredibly expensive for AT&T, however, unlike Direct TV, they are becoming significantly more profitable. The profits for Warner Media in Dec 2019 was \~9.5Billion, these numbers are down for 2020, however much of the loss is attributed to the impacts COVID has had to the entertainment industry. Now, the introduction of HBO Max streaming was botched and delayed, this gave significant ground to Disney and Apple as they released their streaming services, however, HBO Max is reported to have \~38 Million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. Their stated goals are to have over 50 Million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 Billion by that time. 

In addition to this, Warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on HBO Max. This move is definitely putting AT&T on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from Netflix and Disney will be. Warner does still have agreements with AMC, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. This just highlights how significant the move into streaming by Disney and AT&T have been. Yes AT&T was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and Warner Media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable. 

There is a lot more to the Time Warner and HBO piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points. 

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

The AT&T is a dividend Aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$29.54|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|19.44|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.08|
|Yield|7.04% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|Current Payout Ratio (Based on Earnings)|58.26%|

The payout ratio may seem lower here, however, using the Cash flow from the chart above, in 2019 their total cash flow from operations was $48 Billion, minus the CAPEX of \~$20 Billion leaves around $28 Billion in free cash. According to their 2019 10K the amount paid out in dividend distributions was \~$14.8 Billion. So just about half of the free cash, leaving the rest to be paid towards short/long term debt, or whatever other financing activities.  

However, AT&T under their new leadership has several ways to go about increasing their margins here. Firstly, they could pay down debt to decrease future debt payments, this is one route they have mentioned they are committed to. Another is they could cut their dividend payment. The new CEO and management have stated they are committed to the dividend, however, this is a route that could be taken to further increase the cash flow for the company which could be used for more aggressive debt payments, and reinvestment back into the company to further stimulate growth and increase the profitability of their Media segment. 

Note though, AT&T has not been buying back shares at this time, in fact the number of outstanding shares has increased from 5,926 to 7,305. This does dilute the value of the stock, however, over the short term (especially if you are holding more long term), this isn't necessarily bad. You will see less price appreciation, but because they are paying out a dividend it will allow you to accumulate more shares through DRIP, so later on when the company can afford to buy back shares in addition to payout a dividend distribution you will see the benefits from the compounding effect of accumulating shares, and stock price appreciation. This ofcourse assumes that the company will move itself in a position to afford this. So the question you'd have to ask yourself here is whether or not you believe AT&T can manage their debt, whether their telecommunication services will remain relevant, and whether their Media services can turn more a profit. 

# Closing Thoughts:

This stock is definitely more controversial but hopefully this post helped highlight some key points. With the new CEO in management it will be interesting to see how AT&Ts current position changes. They have been trending towards completing their stated goals like bringing down debt, and investing into their media services. 

If you're not sure if you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, please supplement this with your own research. 

A quick disclosure, I do own AT&T stock, but that says nothing! Do your own research! There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

t3_k8hfpn,Preferred stock/baby bond dividends," 

I notice not too many people discuss the options of including preferred stock (dividends) or baby bonds (interest) in their investment portfolio, l would like to know what your thoughts are on this investment option to reduce your portfolio volatility/risk.

I want steady dividend/interest income with less volatility; especially when you get older or are saving for retirement.

Pros- more stability and less risk than common stock, dividend/coupon rate is locked in, normally higher dividends/interest, regular steady income, as long as you buy below PAR (normally $25), you're safe if stock/bonds are called/redeemed in the future. You 're paid first ahead of common stock investors

“Texas Pacific Land Trust Declares Special Dividend of $10.00 Per Share
Provides Update on Corporate Reorganization

November 23, 2020 04:20 PM Eastern Standard Time
DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE: TPL) (“the Trust”) announced today that its Trustees have declared a special cash dividend of $10.00 per sub-share certificate. The special cash dividend, which will be payable on December 17, 2020 to sub-shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 11, 2020, increases the Trust’s cumulative 2020 regular and special dividend offerings to $26.00 per share and represents $201.7 million returned to shareholders this year.

Additionally, the Trust today provided an update on its previously announced corporate reorganization efforts. On March 23, 2020, following a comprehensive review led by a Conversion Exploration Committee that included shareholder representation, the Trustees approved a plan to reorganize the Trust from its current structure to a corporation formed under Delaware law. On June 15, 2020, the Trust announced the name of the new corporation, Texas Pacific Land Corporation (“TPL Corp”), as well as the prospective members of its Board of Directors. A draft registration statement on Form 10 has also been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for review on a non-public basis. The Trust continues to make significant progress toward effecting its planned corporate reorganization and now anticipates that it will occur during the first half of January 2021.

Back in July I started a roth ira with vanguard and contributed the full 6k. After doing more research and opening myself up to the world of investing I decided that dividend investing was the route I wanted to go. I then started a dividend portfolio on M1 finance. Unfortunately in a lapse of judgement I started a roth ira on there as well. Am I correct in understanding that was a mistake and that between the 2 accounts only 6k can be invested? Is there a way I can convert my M1 roth ira into a taxable brokerage account? I would appreciate any advice as I'm trying to get it resolved before tax time. Thanks!,6,0.81,1607332369.0
t3_k89pl1,"CVS, WBA and now Amazon Entering the Ring- A speculative Analysis (NYSE: CVS, NYSE: WBA)","# Introduction:

Ohiogozaimasu everyone. I am back again for another speculation analysis. Obligatory warning: I am in the computer science space, This is just my take on the pharmacy field.

Sector: Healthcare (pharmaceuticals)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
WBA:
WBA owns Duane Reade and Walgreens with global outreach and beauty brands.

> -rapidly increasing total assets

> -Decreasing total equity

> -(Speculation) WBA seems to be going for accessing all medications rather than making deals with insurance like CVS is doing

WBA has been slimming down its costs for years. This is good for a rebound play. WBA has a historic yield between 2-3%. Due to covid, it has jumped to a 4% yield. WBA has also been committed to increasing the dividend payout.

CVS:

CVS is ranked 5th on the Fortune 500 list. CVS recently merged with Aetna. CVS has been aggressively partnering with insurance to drive growth. 

> -Revenue has been up year over year

> -Shifting operating expenses to benefits costs

> -Assets nearly doubled from last year

> -Aggressively growth oriented

> -(Speculation) From the pharmacists I have spoken with, CVS is willing to shift locations of pharmacists if they do not maintain a quota to maintain and raise profits at the expense of the workers

CVS has been rapidly shifting its views towards growth rather than dividend growth. They are just as committed to paying dividends as WBA, just not as focused on increasing their dividends right now.

## The Maths

WBA: 
Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBA/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WBA/balance-sheet?p=WBA) as of Nov 26 2020

CVS: 
Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVS/balance-sheet?p=CVS) as of Nov 26 2020

Stock                          |  WBA     | CVS
-----------------------------|-------- | --------
Stock price                  | $43.41 |  $74.50
Current Annual Payout/Share | $1.87 | $2.00 
Yield                       | 4.31%* |  2.68%
10 Yr Div Growth Rate       | 13.63% | 20.69%
3 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 6.88%  | 5.57%
1 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 3.06%  | 0%
Years Of Growth             | 43     | 0
Current Payout Ratio        | 38.79% | 26.91 %
Free Cash Flow / Share      |  4.69   |  9.63
Revenue                     | 139B  | 266B
Debt / Equity Ratio         |  .738  | 1.394

\* Historic yield of about 3%

WBA is the better bet for dividend appreciation. CVS seems better for growth and balance sheets. This can be seen as WBA dropped from 59.08 in December 2019 to 35.43 in September 2020, for a drop of 40%. This price hasn't recovered yet. Compare this to CVS of 73.57 in December 2019 to 57.32 in September 2020, for a drop of 23%. CVS clearly is less volatile. 

Potential payout based on 3 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary)

I will set back CVS a year to mimic its current behavior.

Year | WBA  | CVS
------|------------| ---------
2021 |  2.00    | 2.00
2022 |  2.13    | 2.11
2023 |  2.28    | 2.23
2024 |  2.44    | 2.35

## Amazon Entering the Pharmaceutical Space
Amazon recently announced that they were entering the pharmaceutical space. I want to give my thoughts on this and why I think this news is being overhyped.

- Amazon is not entering the narcotic space. Pharmacies are still needed for that. As with flu shots. Getting this all in one place is still a “pharmacy” aspect that I do not think Amazon can mimic yet.
- Which leads to the pandemic aspect. I dont know many pharmacists willing to directly expose themselves to other people’s homes. Safely behind a veil at the counter or booth is one thing but open contact with another is up for debate to me. 
- Human and expert aspect: Human interaction cannot be understated to me. Yes it is faster with Amazon’s automation but having an actual source of blame or connection is understated to me. 
- Widened information spread- Everyone who has access to your Amazon account will have access to your order history and cart. Sure, it may just be for Ibuprofen or Hydrocortisone but this may still be something that you want to keep private.
- Multi Accounting to abuse the system. If a person has more than one amazon account, it is reasonable to assume that uniqueness of prescriptions may not be possible. After all, how do you distinguish between 2 pictures of prednisone (a corticosteroid, aka steroid) prescription? This can lead to easier overdoses. I am not certain that all doctors will accept Amazon, even for a while. Thus, “duplicating” prescriptions may become a problem.

That all being said, convenience, couponing with online sources like Honey, and gift cards are all aspects that Amazon has over pharmacies. To my knowledge, pharmacies are facing issues with people claiming to have not received their medication or that the designated recipient never received/delivered the medication is an ongoing issue. Amazon’s solution with signed and ID’d delivery can combat this. That being said, I still think people are underplaying the roles of pharmacies. If you need to get a narcotic or controlled substance at the pharmacy anyway, it is logical for me to assume that you would rather still have your prescriptions picked up at the pharmacy.

## Final Thoughts:

Both WBA and CVS will be titans for decades to come. WBA is stronger for dividend growth. CVS is better to me for its approach to growth. CVS did not drop as far as WBA did and CVS quickly returned to its pre-pandemic price. This shows stability to me. WBA can be a much better rebound play if one wishes.

t3_k9c7vw,Keep Grinding! - Closing in on $2000 Annually,"I'm about one month's worth of contributions away from hitting $2K annually. I've been dividend investing for about 4 years and have only been tracking it closely for the past 1 1/2 years.

&#x200B;

To anyone just starting please keep in mind this is a marathon, not a sprint. When you're starting out it can feel like an uphill battle. Stay the course, invest regularly, and keep grinding. Don't get caught up in the YOLO stocks or get rich quick posts on other subs. For every $TSLA winner their are multiple losers. The dividend payments will become addicting, and honestly all those little dividend raises add up over time. My portfolio's average annual dividend growth is 8.7% So, it's very likely I'll earn an additional $174 in dividends next year from doing nothing. While it may not sound like much, when you compound that growth over time, along with your contributions and dividend reinvestment strategy one can start to see how quick these payments can increase over time.

t3_k98brb,What do you guys think of Kohl's?,"So Kohl's has been soaring lately on vaccine news, an earnings beat, as well as their deal to open up Sephora shops in their stores, which was announced last week.

They also said last month that they will be reinstating their dividend in 2021 (they suspended the dividend this year due to the pandemic). 

I think that the dividend announcement is huge. Even after this big run up the past month or so, it still is a buy at current prices. If pent up demand can lead to sales growth in 2021, as many analysts are now predicting, that could mean Kohl's dividend could easily get back close to what it was pre pandemic. So even if you got in at the current share price of around $41, yield on cost would be fantastic. 

And that isn't unrealistic at all, as this company is in good financial shape despite the pandemic. Much better than it's competitors. Their one quarter at the start of the pandemic, they reported losses, but since then they have managed to pull off narrow profits despite all of the headwinds with the virus. these headwinds have been devastating for JcPenny and Macy's, two companies that were already skating on thin ice before the virus. 

My theory is that Kohl's fills a nice niche in the market where it is kind of like the middle ground shopping experience. What other physical store can someone go to to get the department store experience without the big price tag? 

Target and Dicks sporting goods are the only true competitors that Kohl's has to compete with for this niche now, but sometimes people just want to go to Kohl's. If I were to go out clothes shopping, I was strictly shopping for clothes, and I could only pick one of these 3 to go to, Kohl's would be the clear best choice. 

I think the Kohl's leadership understands this.
They know that their true competitors are Target and Dicks. They have been fending off Dicks in the athleisure and sports wear categories quite effectively for awhile. They announced a new athleisure product line a few months back which will also help them fend off competition not only from Dicks but also Lululemon who are trying to establish themselves in this space. [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/kohls-challenges-lululemon-with-new-athleisure-line-2020-10-20%3famp)

So they seem to effectively be fending off competition in the sports wear and athleisure categories, but they have been pretty weak on beauty products in the past, as this market grows. Target has been beating them in beauty, and Kohl's has been striking back with their own beauty product lines, although they are far behind Target which has a deal to carry Ulta beauty products in their stores. This has been a weak point for Kohl's. The Sephora deal which was announced last week, and will see Kohl's open 200 Sephora shops in Fall 2021, will be key to success in the fight for beauty products with Target. Kohl's says it plans to expand Sephora shops to at least 850 of their store locations by 2023.  [(source)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kohls-kss-rallies-plans-open-124712433.html)

t3_k9kl08,Looking at dividends monthly rather than yearly,"I've seen too many people get discouraged when it comes to dividends and how much they get yearly. I personally think when someone sees yearly they automatically compare it to their own salary... and unless you have hundreds of thousands/millions of capital invested you will be nowhere near a reasonable salary. I feel like people need to look at dividends more as monthly to really appreciate how much they are brining in. 

An example... I read a few posts today posting they hit 2000 and 3000 a year in dividends. Sure you can't retire off that... but that is $166 a month and $250 a month... that alone pays most peoples phone bill, internet bill and a utility payment (electric, water, gas) in that month. (This may vary from person to person). 

I personally just hit $1000 a year ($83/month). All my dividends get reinvested but already this could pay for my internet each month and have a bit extra. By the time I retire (I'm 27) between my RRSP (I'm canadian), and my investments i will have MUCH MUCH more than I need to live a comfortable life in retirement and have a solid foundation of stocks to hand down to my kids who I will teach to invest from a very young age.

So for those who are feeling discouraged at only seeing small returns on their dividends... dont make your first goal to hit 10k a year... make your first goal something smaller like a phone bill.

t3_kak7h3,"Different markets, same company?","Does it matter from which market you buy a stock? To give an example, let's take Royal Dutch Shell PLC. 

Since I am from Europe(I don't know if you can do this from the US, probably yes) I have the option of investing in Royal Dutch Shell in pounds (ticker: RDSA, at London Stock Exchange) or in euros (ticker: R6C, at the Deutche Borse Xetra). From my research, there are some differences between the two( ex: the price movement, and also the dividend isn't quite the same amount but I think that is because of the exchange rate).

I started using a credit union for all of my house purchases roughly 2 years ago. After the first year I found out the credit union gives out dividends from their profit. This year it was .37 for interest from my savings, and .077 or so for every dollar paid to loan interest. Because I have a few thousand in loans I was able to get about $700. This will probably sit in my savings account for next year, so Im excited for the next one.

t3_ka94n9,7% div return with low risk and mixture of growth.,"Hey guys, just found this sub. I have been trading and investing for a little over 10 years and have saved up quite a bit. I work for a HF that seeks to manage market neutral accounts. 

My personal account has been sitting pretty good at 7% monthly dividend. Here are the positions, let me know if you guys have any.

KBWD: I got this guy before the vaccine announcement pushed the fintech sector. Pays out alot and is a good etf of mid tier fin firms. 

PSK: With low interest rates bonds are kinda fried right now. Preferred shares offer a nice alternative and are relatively stable in this broad ETF of the fin industry. 

O: can't avoid this bad boy. Undervalued right now and is positioned to run in 21. Could see a larger increase in div rate as well. Just be sure to get in at a good time. 

MAIN: pretty easy stock. Has a little bit of risk but the ebit and management team are solid. It's a good pick if you manage it properly. 

SDIV: get some international exposire with this dividend ETF of tier 1 and 2 markets. 

STAG and ARCC: wild cards but provide an inverse play. If covid is extended STAG goes up due to it being in e-commerce. If covid goes away ARCC goes up due to it's sector position.

Other then that I throw in VT and EEM for international exposire. GDX for an inflation hedge (2%). 

Finally for growth I put in VTI, SPY, PSI, ARKK, and VGT. 

Doing this your getting 7% off the dividend stocks with little risk while also having a decent growth section in your portfolio. 

It's not perfect and the risk is a major bear market but if that happens then GDX will kick ass and SDIV will carry more weight.",95,0.99,1607576961.0
t3_ka93gn,How beneficial are dividend portfolios in taxable accounts?,"So I began investing last year when I graduated college and got my first job. Im currently 24 and  have a few investment accounts - one is growth which is have about 8k invested in, I'm also currently maxing out my Roth IRA, meeting my companies 401k match and started a dividend portfolio which I'm currently investing roughly ~$500 a month into. 

I always hear great things about dividend portfolios and how they could eventually replace my monthly income and I could retire early, Which is my goal. I like that this portfolio will provide an income without having to wait until a certain age (59.5 for my Roth) 

One thing I run into often is the thought of is starting a dividend portfolio in a taxable account really worth it right now or should I focus more on growth stocks? (don't know much about evaluating growth stocks so I'll have to learn that). I sometimes feel like the 15% tax will take a big enough hit that theres some lost opportunity cost if I was to invest elsewhere (growth stocks) 

Like I stated earlier, my Roth IRA Is being maxed out and invested into target funds.

Holdings in my dividend portfolio are: T, O, WBA, NRZ,  KO, SPHD. Would it make sense to add some more growth companies into this portfolio? Such as AAPL, Etc.

Based on what I've learned and the success I've been reading about on this thread, I have been working on a dividend strategy of my own. I've built an excel calculator to project potential growth on hypothetical stocks, but I think I'm doing something wrong in my formula.

My scenario that I've plugged in is with a $5,800 upfront investmet spread acorss 9 shares at an average cost of $159.33/share and a 2.097 div/yield. I've extrapolated the growth out for 4 years with a 3% increase YoY in stock price. I've also factored in dividend reinvestment and an additional  $5,200 in annual investment. That being said, I am seeing year 1 dividends of $27.36 and year 4 has grown to only $135.04.

I understand this is a long game and requires  patience, but those numbers seemed off to me based on the successes stories I've read on here. Does this seem off to anyone else?

t3_kbhlyq,Comparison of O and QQQ in the latter's boom,"Here I've posted a simple backtest from 2015 to 2020 comparing the total return of O and the QQQ Nasdaq 100 trust. I was thinking of limiting the test prior to covid, say from 2015 to 2019, but I thought otherwise and will say why I've done so because I believe reality still supports the dividend stock on a time-frame from 2015 to 2020.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2015&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=0&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=true&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=QQQ&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=O&allocation1_1=100

If you look at the period from 2015 to 2019, O was neck and neck with the QQQ trust in terms of total return. This was a period when tech absolutely boomed and people thought commercial real estate was a boomer idea, so to speak. Had you invested in O in 2015 you would be about even with a trust that tracks the most promising of the profitable tech companies, megacap included. Neck and neck with the best of the best. Until this year. I understand backtests only say so much, but not everyone can invest the day they were born. It's worthwhile to compare a stock in a sector few cared about to a sector that attracted mass adoration in its boom time.

You only see the real deviation with covid, when commercial real estate share pricing dived due to market sentiment (and, yes, temporary but real commercial rent collection decline).

I have no bias against the Nasdaq 100. They're fine investments in my eye, provided you're selective.

But let us have a moment for people who bought what is likely a melt up and neglected one of the kindest entry points for a real estate company that can issue debt for free in years... and which performed as well as one of the most booming sectors this decade... despite being a boring old REIT.

The divergence in 2020 is clear. O's share price was brought down to Earth and I'd recommend QQQ as a fairly safe growth fund most of the time provided one continually invests. Should I focus only on growth in share price and a secular incline, I'd buy the trust and would sleep at night. Tech is great. I'm not knocking it. It's not 2000 for the most part.

I will say it's highly impressive O matched its returns even in a very recent period. If you think a crisis year caused a melt up in certain sectors due to a frothy and ignorant market which might turn down as froth is known to do... then other sectors are prime rib to one's teeth right now. 

And if you know of a company that can issue free debt* besides O right now, let me know, because I think investing in O is one of the most forward looking actions one can take as the year ends.

It is all about the entry point, sometimes.

*By free debt I mean issuing nearly a billion dollars in debt at less than even meager inflation expansion, some of which is due in the next decade. Real cost of capital is effectively 0 for Realty Income in an acquisition boom year for triple net real estate companies. I do understand individual companies shouldn't be compared to ETFs generally, but I make an exception here. O and QQQ are almost meme-like in my mind, yet I think one presents a stronger fundamental case than the other, especially in terms of debt and real growth patterns, ie, the things that matter.

t3_kcassi,"Dividend ""in kind"" / goods or services","Hey

It's just 2 years since I began investing in dividend stocks and I'm still learning. So I want to share something fun I just recently learned (for all the newbies and starters): Dividends don't just come in cash, they can be ""in kind"" i.e. goods or services. 

A pyjama producer in my country (switzerland) will give me a cash dividend PLUS a free pyjama every year, if I own 20 shares. (Calida; Caln.sw). A share is about 30 bucks. So 600 bucks will give me a 2.5% dividend (mostly stable in the past) plus a pyjama worth about  100 bucks (store price; very stable) p.a., resulting in a de facto dividend of 15% or more. 

Calidas finances look fine to me (even as I expect a recession because of covid); I love the thought of getting a free pyjama every year for the rest of my life for an investment of 600 bucks (or as long as the company exists).

Other companies may  

* give free coupons for on board (carnival cruises; ccl; 100 shares)
* give you a suitcase full of chocolate (Lindt & Sprüngli; LISP.SW; 1 share )
* give you a calendar (Novartis, NVS; 1 share needed)
* let you rent cars much cheaper / share owner sales discount (sixt; [six2.de](https://six2.de); 1 share ) 
* give you free entrance/rides Zoos/Railway companies: 
* ...
* (I'm excluding the companies that give you free food if you come to their assembly).

&#x200B;

Some aspects to consider:

Positive: 

* Goods aren't taxable; so no deductions
* dividend de facto increased
* Fun 

&#x200B;

Negative:

* Maybe no dividend growth
* Owning more shares than just enough to get the item may not be worth it. 
* No cash dividend / you would have to sell the item, probably for less than it's worth

t3_kco79a,Lam Research - A speculative analysis (LRCX),"# Introduction:

Welcome back everyone. I am back again for another speculation analysis. 

Sector: Technology (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
Lam Research is a wafer fabrication supplier for the semiconductor industry. Now let me break down that sentence for the non-techie’s of the subreddit. Wafers are thin components for semiconductors. A semiconductor is a material that can mimic and flip between a conductor (let electricity pass) and an insulator (not allow electricity). They are made small and thin so as to minimize time between instructions. 

Strengths:
- Required for circuitry and technological advancements
- 5G on the rise- they will need wafers in mass production
- Very high growth ceiling
- WFH and corona was a boon to the business (mostly positive, precautions still in place)

Risks:
- Lots of competitors. Not certain if all are on the stock exchange but Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA (KLAC), Teradyne (TER), Entegris (ENTG), MKS Instruments (MKSI), and Brooks Automation (BRKS) are some decent ones to compare
-  This is a growth stock more than a dividend growth stock. They do grow the dividend but this is being evaluated more based on growth than dividend (to be ranted about later)
- Depth and complexity of chips will always increase. This is the flipside to growth. It has the balance sheet, and I am not worried. But as technology evolves, semiconductors need to evolve too. Like stronger NAND flash (usbs and SD cards) for a short example.
- China ban/embargo. Demand will remain but if the US is banned from exporting to China, it will need to be rerouted elsewhere. Immediate response is that they are in the application process as of Q3 earnings call, of getting the license to ship to China. As a positive, this shows their dedication to stick to their ethics and corporate compliance policies.


## Financial History and numbers

Debt / Equity Ratio         |  1.12

Lam Research has been paying a dividend since 2014 and has increased the dividend quite consistently. The payout ratio of 23% tells me that they have room to grow for a while. The downside is that the rate of increasing dividends is inconsistent but it does grow. But from a growth perspective, Lam is up 533% in 5 years, up 79% in 1 year. I don’t think this growth is anywhere close to done. I am uncertain as to why seeking alpha does not list years of growth but I will leave it empty due to that.

Potential payout based on 1 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary)

## Growth Potential Rant
One of my main realizations early on is that technology is ever evolving. In this day and age, it seems to be going exponentially rather than linearly. Circuitry is at the baseline of technology. 
Da Vinci Surgical Robot: A couple of months ago, you may have seen a video of the Da Vinci Surgical Systems robot allowing minimally invasive surgery. While this robot was not made by LRCX, it just shows the evolution of technology and how circuity is coming to other sectors. 
The rise of 5G: We’ve heard it all over. 5G is coming. Guess what, semiconductors will be involved. I think this may be the safer play rather than speculating on the communication sector, or the first company to release 5G. Instead of betting on those, why not speculate on safe suppliers of 5G components? Well what happens after 5G becomes mainstream? I don't think this is even close to the pinnacle. Years ago, LTE and 4G were phenomenal. Now 5G is the new buzz. Technology evolves. What will come in the future to make 5G obsolete? I’m near certain semiconductors will be involved.
Other electronics: As technology evolves and semiconductors are further optimized, I expect other electronics to adapt too. Motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, tablets, remote controlled toys, and so much more all benefit from semiconductor optimization. Faster command execution, cheaper products, smaller products. There is just so much room.
We are approaching the point where technology can do things that may not be needed. [Robo Dog](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). Point in case, we are optimizing robotic pets.
I really don't see the upper bound of semiconductor use. Technology will keep evolving so semiconductors will evolve with them.

## Final Thoughts:

I don't want to oversell my conviction but I think this sub-industry may be one of the Teslas of dividends. This stock is barely talked about, unlike disruptive stocks like SQ. This company has room to sprint, keep paying dividends, it's practically all we want out of a growth stock but pays a growing dividend too.

t3_kdog5t,M1 philosophy,"I'm asking this here rather than over in r/M1 because I'm hoping for a more diverse opinion.  I've been investing for over 11 years and I'm on track to receive $14700 in dividends this year. I have the majority of my investments in Fidelity. My IRA is set to DRIP but I have my 'fun account' just hold the dividends until I decide what to reinvest in. 

 I've been watching Joseph Carlson and a couple other youtubers and was intrigued by M1. I opened up an account with $100 just to get the feel for it. I figured out the mechanics and it seems like it's just more of a high octane DRIP account. I like that you can buy partial shares. 

Maybe it's just showing my age or just my comfort with traditional stock investing but I don't 'get' M1. With traditional investing you have a set amount of money, you find a stock you want to invest in and you purchase as much as you want.  One of the reasons I don't have my fun account set to DRIP is not all the stocks maybe worth  investing in at that moment. Setting the different percentages seems fidgety and what do you decide to set at 15%? 26% etc. 

Has anyone tried M1 and 'get it'? Anyone else dip a toe in and decide it wasn't for them?",60,0.94,1608048388.0

t3_kdgnzt,US investor loving Canada,"So I am a US guy that does a lot of business in Canada. This has helped open my perspectives on investments. Looking at Canada, I think it will grow bigly in the future, especially over the next 20 years. Here is why I think that:

The earth is getting warmer, most CA citizens live within 31 miles of the US border, and this will move more people north. I expect a doubling of population by 2035. This will be huge for growth. Yuge. 

Immigration policies:Canada has a ton of immigrants, further adding to my top point and helping the growth. This won’t slow down. 

Liberal healthcare policies: this is the way. The US spends so much if you add up your actual costs that we just piss money away. 

Responsibility: Canadian banks have actual rules and are responsible with investments. The US banks are living in the Wild West and I don’t trust a single one. 

I have moved most of my fun money into Canadian investments when I think it’s in a dip. I will continue to invest over the next 19 years, but will reap the Divis. I can’t choose all the Canadian companies I want because use Robinhood, but I can get a lot. 

Here are the Can companies I hold a position in:
ENB
RY
SU
MFC
TD
BNS
RY
BCE
CNQ

t3_kdc8yw,TSX dividend help / question,"So I've been reading most posts out here.  Always very helpful, I really learned a lot.

I've been looking to add some dividend stock to my portfolio in order to balance the risk (somehow) of it.  I've been watching 

DIR-UN

Yield: 5,44% (but never seems to appreciate)
Payout ratio: 47,22%

So I thought that was a safe bet.  Then I remembered the subreddit I read here about how you want to look for a dividend 'grower'.  Dividend needs to keep appreciating in value through the years.  I look at my portfolio and I have Manulife...

MFC

Yield: 4,91% (keeps going up.  But... read lower)
Payout ratio: 41,13%
Stock price also still has room to catch up to pre-covid levels.

But after looking at the historical data (dividend) I see a 50% slash in 2009.  I went to read about it to realize it was a financial crisis but the CND banks didn't cut their dividends back in 2009...

It got me looking in the CND banks:

BMO

Yield: 4,24% (keep being raised over the years but now on hold because of covid government restrictions) 

Does it mean the dividend will explode when the restrictions are lifted? Special dividend?  Acquisition?

Payout ratio: 56,16%

In conclusion, if I follow the general rule of thumbs I read on this sub, I come to think that I should probably go with a CND bank stock.  What are your thoughts?  Simple analysis here, I might be missing something?",3,1.0,1607997663.0

t3_ke6j95,Opinions on my dividend portfolio,"Hi guys! 

This is my first post; I'm an avid reader for several months now, but I've just started dividend investing 10 months ago and was learning / practicing along the way.
I'm an EU citizen, 40 years old, and due to EU regulations I can't have exposure to all the wonderful ETFs you have in the US, but I have access to NYSE/NASDAQ stocks through IBKR pro. Since March 2020, I've been purchasing every month about 500$ worth of stocks. Some months I've managed to even put around 1000 $. My portfolio is currently at around 9,000 $ (about 10% unrealized profit), current dividend yield  4,6%. 
My largest positions: T - 10%, ABBV - 9%, LMT - 8%, AMZN - 7%, MO - 6,5%, AAPL - 5,5%, MSFT - 5%, STX - 5%, PPL - 4%, WFC - 4%, DOW - 3%, XOM - 3%, INTC - 3%, O - 3%, C - 2,5%, KO - 2,5%, EPD - 2%, MFA 1,5%, ET - 1,5%. The rest are all below 150$: PAA, GOOGL, IBM, JPM, DUK, CVX, IRM, KSS, FB, KHC, ARR, TRGP, IVZ, AGNC, SLB, NLY, LTC.

As I was purchasing and learning along the way, I'm aware I have too much different positions. I still haven't sold any position that I have (for the better - some losers are becoming winners; specifically - WFC, MFA and ET). I'm getting ready to trim down to about 20-25 stocks, and then strengthen the positions that remain. But, given the fact that I currently have 36 positions, I frankly don't know where to start.

t3_kfnsmd,The ULTIMATE Dividend Growth Starter Pack,"So I’ve seen a lot of people on this sub ask for recommendations, especially younger/newer investors who are just getting into the game.

I wanted to help these people out and assemble what I like to call the “Dividend Growth Starter Pack”

Here’s what it features:

1) Limited selection of stocks to avoid over-diversification and allow for more effective compounding

2) HIGH dividend growth rates

3) Low payout ratios 

4) Histories of FAT dividend growth

5) Currently undervalued

I’m also going to list several potential replacements/alternatives. I will list them in my personal order of preference but it’s up to you to choose one and only one and stick to it.

1) Industrials - $LHX (highest conviction pick) OR $LMT > $NOC

2) Financial - $AMP OR $TROW > $AFL OR $BLK

3) Consumer Staple - $TSN OR $HRL

4) Technology - $AVGO OR $TXN

5) Consumer Discretionary - $LOW OR $HD

6) Healthcare - $ABBV (my 2nd highest conviction pick) OR $BMY OR $MRK

7) Communication Services - $NXST (broadcasting station)

8) REITS - $HASI (renewable energy infrastructure REIT), $IIPR (cannabis REIT), $DLR (data storage REIT)

9) Materials - Avoid. This sector is far too cyclical and commodities price dependent to provide us the reliable dividend growth we seek. Might be worth having a gold miner in here as an inflationary hedge but I wouldn’t make it a big holding.

10) Energy/Utilities: $BEPC or $NEE (these are a bit overvalued rn)

Invest equally among the stocks you chose from the list above. 

Your portfolio with these stocks would look like this:

~2-3% starting yield (based on which stocks you choose)

~10-15% 5 year DGR

~30-40% payout ratio

~10-15 years consecutive dividend growth history

- 50% of holdings still below 52 week high despite growing revenues and earnings

- Conservative 6-8% annual dividend growth for next few years

Based on this, you should be able to reach a nice 5% yield on cost with some pretty safe companies that also have strong growth characteristics in the span of a few years.

For those with less of an appetite for risk I’ll assemble another list later with lower dividend growth but longer dividend growth histories.

t3_kgft5m,Investment opinion on The GEO Group - Private Prison stock with 14.2% dividend,"I have recently taken a large position (well for me) on The GEO Group. I will explain my reasoning and look forward to your opinion.

The GEO Group is a REIT that owns and operates Prisons primarily in the USA for State and Federal agencies.

Reward: They currently pay a 14.2% dividend. Prior to COVID, they paid a quarterly dividend of $0.48 which would result in a dividend of 20% dividend if it returns to that rate. My assumption is they will return to a quarterly dividend of $0.42 in 2 years.

Risks:

1. Biden has made a campaign promise to eliminate private prisons.

My thoughts:

* Many politicians make this promise but very hard to do because of GEO's political giving and a large number of jobs in key states.

1. COVID law suites - There have been a few law suites but they are handling COVID pretty well.

My thesis, is prisons will remain private, perhaps 1 will be converted to the public for political reasons but that won't happen for 3 to 5 years. Several COVID lawsuits but it will be managed.

In 2 to 3 years 16% to 20% percent dividend and a 50% stock price increase. My model shows my $12,000 in stock will have a compound return to $39,000 in 10 years and then result in a yearly income of $2300 a year.

My downside is calculated at 1/2 my investment - $6,000

It's a high risk / high reward.

They own premier real estate with a dividend that has been amazing over the past 10-15 years. The only dividend cut that was significant was when Covid hit the US and it wasn’t even necessary on their end. However, it paved the way for them to acquire undervalued companies that will increase their profit margin over the long term.

t3_kh8nvy,Flowers Foods - A Speculative Analysis (NYSE: FLO),"# Introduction:

Welcome back everyone. I am back again for another speculation analysis. 

Sector: Consumer Staples (Packaged Food)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
Flowers Foods is a bakery focused company. They specialize in breads, buns, rolls, and other similar products. They cover the following brands: 
- Nature's Own
- Dave's Killer Bread
- Canyon Bakehouse
- Tastykake
- Mrs. Freshley's
- Wonder
- Sunbeam bread
- Merita
- Captain John Derst's
- Evangeline Maid
- European Bakers
- Butternut
- Mi Casa
- Bunny Bread
- Homepride

Strengths:
- Bread is a globally bought food and to me is a household staple like rice
- Committed to raising their dividend year after year (only drops were during stock splits)
- Covid increased Sales therefore will likely return to previous figures post Covid era at worst

Risks:
- High payout ratio (62.99%)
- Very boring stock
- Dividend growth is very slight year over year (right now it raises by 4 cents a year)


## Financial History and numbers

FLO: 
Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLO/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FLO/balance-sheet?p=FLO) as of Dec 19 2020


Stock                          |  FLO

Debt / Equity Ratio         | 1.02
Debt / EBITDA            | 2.19

Flowers Foods has been paying a dividend since November 2011 and has increased the dividend quite consistently. The only time they drop the dividend is during a 3-for-2 stock split. The payout ratio of 63% tells me that they are pretty leveraged. The growth rate tells me that they are quite committed to continuing paying.They have an asset to liability ratio of about 3. This makes me think that the payout ratio may be due to branding deals.

Potential payout based on 3 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary). More realistically, they might continue the trend of raising by only 4 cents per year.

## Final Thoughts:
In our search to find companies that make the most dough, the boring ones are often overlooked. It becomes so ingrained in our searches for the optimal picks that we forget that some safety in our portfolio is all ryeght. I don't think people will loaf around when it comes to buying bread, so it will at least remain a household staple for years to come. I think FLO is set up to at yeast be a safe pick for years to come. The pandemic seems to have not phased them so I can safely say that FLO is at the very least on a roll. All right, I'm done making puns in the final thoughts, they're getting quite stale.

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research. And remember all, let’s get this bread.

I received about $250 of dividends my first year and now I’m up to over $1,000 a month in my Roth IRA and traditional IRA.

So, I’m not saying it should be a huge part of your portfolio necessarily but I’ve been buying blue chip stocks like T for some time now and this is a great time to jump in at these valuations. These are the kinds of stocks that can help you build generational wealth.

Disclaimer: I own T and have a cost basis of around $28 a share.

t3_kik3go,"Opinion: for most people who own more than 20-30 dividend stocks, an ETF would be superior.","SCHD, DGRO, VIG, NOBL, etc.

I frequently see portfolio posts here where someone has 20+ large cap dividend stocks - AAPL, MSFT, MMM, MCD, JNJ, etc etc etc. And they ask ""is my portfolio good?""

There is not really much to say to that - if you pick stable dividend paying companies, they're not going to go out of business anytime soon.

It's ""fine."" 

You won't go broke. It's also pure random chance whether your portfolio will do better than an index -- and by adding individual stocks you introduce the possibility of making mistakes, and are more likely to underperform than over-perform.

The stability and safety of dividend paying companies does not preclude that they may be overpriced, or that you'll buy and sell at the wrong times. Statistically, most retail investors make these mistakes.

Nobody who invests as a hobby is going to have 20+ great picks. Most professional investors don't have 20+ amazing ideas.

Over-diversification is a real risk because even a few bad picks can severely harm your overall returns. Staying up to date on a portfolio of 30+ stocks is a serious time commitment.

----

I think the best argument against my claim is: *it's more fun and interesting to own individual companies than a boring ETF*, but in that case your portfolio is being chosen for aesthetics rather than performance, so asking anyone else's opinion about it is pointless.

Warren Buffett (and many other excellent investors) advocate for concentrated portfolios of approximately 10 stocks. Diversification is a backstop against ignorance, and if you are ignorant then just buy an ETF.

Arguments about fee drag are silly when you can find an ETF with expense ratio of 0.10% or less very easily - about as significant as a rounding error.

----

It concerns me when people read the dividend investing literature, and their takeaway is that it doesn't matter what company you invest in as long as they continue to pay a stable dividend. 

It's entirely possible for a stock to pay a steady, increasing dividend but still have a flat or *negative total return* over a multi-year period - even with all dividends reinvested.

[Example 1: PPL](https://i.imgur.com/d8sjjtU.png)
[Example 2: IBM](https://i.imgur.com/gpbDYrI.png)

Market-cap weighted ETFs or index funds will add larger weight to winners and automatically kick out losers over time, which helps solve this problem without you doing anything.

**TLDR** If you do enough research to confidently buy individual stocks, narrow down to your best 10 ideas and exercise some discipline by kicking out the rest. 

if you own a lot of different stocks and ever consider asking the internet ""is my portfolio good"" then you'd be much better off owning an ETF.",8,0.7,1608690532.0

t3_kj8ivq,A retrospective on the Brian Barnes AMA. (Plus solicitation for feedback and very important subreddit info!),"Good afternoon r/dividends,

Thank you to everyone who participated in our AMA with Brian Barnes (u/BarnesM1).  I would like to officially thank him for taking the time to participate in this community. The event turned out to be a massive success by every metric. I was genuinely blown away both by the number of questions and by the number of his responses.  Some statistics:

- 264 total comments.

- 53 questions answered.

- 100% of questions asked during the initial two hour window were answered by Mr. Barnes, as were a few additional ones the next Monday. 

- Most upvoted answer: Taco Bell as his favorite fast food restaurant. 

- 37 rule breaking comments removed.  If you asked a question during the original two hours, and it didn't get answered it means it was either a duplicate and got removed, or it broke the rules and got removed.

- Most common reason for removal: People asking Brian for a job. 

- 0 permanent bans issued. 

My locking of the post was entirely prearranged. It is the intended strategy for every AMA that will be conducted on r/dividends.  Once the host indicates to me that they are done answering questions, I will lock it for them so they do not get notifications for the next six months until Reddit archives the post.  It also helps on the moderation side. 

With that being said. My eyes now turn to the next AMA. I have become a fan to the idea of the CEOs of brokerages hosting AMAs. I think it fits perfectly with the subreddit, and considering how it works with the community since people seemed to really like it, I want to continue this trend.

So while all the PR teams representing these CEOs are on vacation for the holidays, now is the perfect time to discuss who should host AMAs here on r/dividends. No suggestion is a bad one. 

However, I will issue a piece of advice. I have noticed that when I am reaching out to these companies, I am often hearing back responses about how they don't really understand what Reddit even is, or why it would be important.  As a retail manager, I can be incredibly good at getting people on board with an idea while simultaneously making them think it was their idea. Here is my conundrum.

For PR teams, the CEOs time is money. They need the most metaphorical bang for their buck. PR teams want interviews. They understand the idea of eyeballs, media, and attention. If you give them a large enough potential audience, they will jump through hoops to learn this new medium, and will work to promote the company.

This is how Reddit itself got Obama to do an AMA. How Reddit gets hundreds of celebrities per year to host AMAs. By promising tens of millions of eyes.  An audience of 60,000 is valuable to a company the size of M1. But to a company like Vanguard. 60,000 is barley worth a sixty second spot for a PR intern.

Don't get me wrong. I have been reaching out, and there are individuals willing to host AMAs with our community. All I am saying, is that the larger r/dividends becomes, the more high profile our guests. So if you want to see warren buffet on here before he eventually passes away, we need more members.

I currently am speaking with two companies about their CEOs hosting AMAs. One is publicly traded. I'm not going to reveal who in case it doesn't work out, but I am taking suggestions. As many as this subreddit can physically give me. 

The CEO of any company. No matter how big or small. No matter the country.  Youtubers, executives, media personalities, etc. If it relates to dividends or investing in general, fair game. Brokerages?  Whatever you want to see.",5,0.78,1608783336.0

I’ve seen a lot of people recommend on this Reddit page to put more into growth at my age. This is purely my “fun” money account. Monthly, I contribute to a traditional and Roth, post tax accounts. I put away savings into cash in HYSA. Finally I put money into a Schwab account with index funds and such. 

I also put money weekly into this portfolio. These numbers are skewed, it’s hard to look in robinhood for the exact percents and I got lazy.

Ignoring tesla (I put in some money at the dip this year before the ramp up from March onwards), where should I diversify?

Do I need more sectors, do I need to consolidate my reits together for example? Do I just keep DCA? 

I’m trying to look into more dividend kings like MCD and JNJ etc, but I wanted to hear y’all’s opinions!

My goal is 200 a month in dividends, right now I’m at about 40-50 at a 22000 portfolio (obviously half is tesla and doesn’t pay a dividend) just to feel good about it. Thank you for any advice!",17,1.0,1608779399.0

GSK: 1,4,7,10.  yield > 5%.

Greencoat UK Wind: 2, 5, 8, 11. Yield > 5%.

Invesco Perpetual UK: 3,6,9,12. Yield < 4%.


Grid: 1,8. Yield > 5% .

M&G: 5,9 Yield > 5%.

L&G: 6,9. Yield > 5%.

BAE systems: 6,12. Yield < 5%.


The average yield ends up being around 6% or so.
Dividend payment dates cover the whole year which is nice. I screened all of the companies and their dividend has been increasing as well as the stock for most of them (exception applies to GSK in terms of growth in this case).

Simple portfolio but it covers quite a few industries and it's quite good for steady dividends in the UK for your ISA.

Stocks: | $O 8.16% | $AAPL 8.86% | $KO 14.36% | $JNJ 5.11%| 

I am also currently looking at $XOM, $EPD, $BYND, $BLK, $NNDM to expand into, some for diversification into different fields and some for the growth factor.

t3_klaj2q,Young seasoned Trader breaking into the Investing world.,"So before I introduce my main question. Let me give you all a quick oversight of my current situation. I'm currently 21 years old finishing up my last year of obtaining my BS in Mathematics. I work as a operations supervisor for UPS which allows me to half roughly an extra $1k a month to put into savings ( after rent & other living expenses ) on top of the gains that come from my Derivatives account and Penny Stock account. Due to the hours I work I've always managed to be able to trade the markets. I have been trading Options and Penny Stocks since the age of 16 with my main strategy consisting of delta neutral trades. So when it comes to financial markets I have built up a great deal of knowledge ( within the speculative side ). So as I continue to read about advice for young investors the majority of responses consist of not focusing on dividends, but focusing on growth stock opportunities. Which makes perfectly good sense. That being said , most young investors I've noticed don't actively trade 2 other riskier/ quicker return % instruments that produce returns similar to what growth investing would. With all of that being said . In my current situation of having to accounts that are actively being traded with riskier higher returning instruments . Would it be more beneficial for me to focus on Dividends and not so much growth due to the high level of risk already associated with my other 2 accounts? The idea of creating a dividend portfolio for passive income to intrigue me a good bit , but at the same time I'm also after the wealth. Hence why I've traded pennies and options for so long.

I'm a fan of GOOD. Indeed, I own shares and it represents a goodly portion of my portfolio even though I refuse to touch the Gladstone BDCs.

t3_kmlgfs,Brief Guide to Evaluating Bank Stocks,"Lots of people avoid investing in banks because they are hard to evaluate, their balance sheets can be opaque, and they are a heavily regulated industry. 

However, banks are also a core part of the economy, and many pay some nice, steady dividends.

The core business of a bank, taking in deposits and then lending them out at a higher rate to create “net interest margin” (NIM) is naturally profitable and that business model isn’t going anywhere.

Here's a broad overview to make choosing bank stocks a bit easier!

### Types of Banks

**Mega-Banks**: JPM, C, BAC, WFC, GS

With fingers in all sorts of investment pies, these huge banks offer many services – investment banking, wealth management, and loans (smaller part of their revenue than most). They may also have all sorts of crazy derivatives on the books, making their valuations difficult to judge, and in my opinion, riskier than people give credit for. 

JPM usually considered best managed, C or WFC if you like comeback stories.

**Custody Banks**: STT, BK

These two banks hold investment assets for institutional managers, hedge funds, etc and split this huge pie of assets roughly equally. An incredibly stable business model, but growth is modest. 

State Street (STT) runs famous ETFs such as SPY, while BNY Mellon (BK) owns Pershing, which serves RIAs and other investment advisors, a possible source of revenue growth. (I rarely see these custody banks discussed, and I think they're underrated)

**Regional US Banks**: USB, MTB (my two favorites, there are others as well).

Regional banks are moderately large and geographically diversified, but have less strict capital requirements that the mega-banks must uphold (bank regulation is a deep rabbit hole to jump down, much too big to cover here).

USBank is best-of-breed here in my opinion, with top-notch management, efficient operations, as well as a payments-processing business with a moat. There are other competitors in this space (FITB, KEY) which you can investigate to see if they appear to be a bargain relative to the excellence of USB.

**Canadian Banks**: RY, TD, BNS…

There are five (I think) dominant banks in Canada. They pay nice dividends. Many have wide international reach – Scotiabank (BNS) is deep in Latin America, for example – which is a differentiating feature among them. 

Living in the US I don’t want to hassle with Canadian tax withholding on my dividends, so I don’t own these, but otherwise they could be attractive.

**Community Banks**. For a nice list, see holdings of the ETF QABA.

These are interesting – micro-caps, typically with between 30-50 branches in a locality. Their success will largely depend on the region they operate in – think of them like a super-regional, mini-ETF because they survive and thrive by giving loans to local small businesses. 

Most of their revenue comes from loan spreads, so more interest rate sensitive – but they also are less heavily regulated, allowing for (sometimes) better profit margins than their larger cousins. 

Recently PPP gave a massive cash infusion to community banks, and while that program has ended, it’s been good for balance sheets.

Lots of due diligence needed, as the efficiency and operations of these vary bigly, and you’ll want to evaluate them closely before investing. 

My favorites: STXB (Houston-Texas, rapidly growing), NTB (Bahamas and Cayman Islands, good dividend). 

### Evaluating Bank Stocks – Important Ratios

The balance sheet for a bank is different from non-financial stocks, so ratios you may normally use can be useless or totally misleading. (Particularly, ROIC is meaningless).

Here are some that can be useful:

**Price/Book**: basically how expensive a bank’s stock is (more meaningful than P/E). P/B between 1-2 is normal, P/B < 1 usually means either problems on the balance sheet, or a bargain.

**ROE**: Return on Equity, obviously higher is better. How effectively a bank uses your investment dollar to generate profits. With interest rates being low, banks that have more tangential businesses (e.g. wealth management) do better on this metric than others.

A bank can show higher ROE if it is highly levered, has a lot of debt on the books, this is not desirable way to boost ROE…

**Dividend Payout Ratio**: how much of a bank’s earnings go out to pay dividends. If this is > 75%, concerning. Also check history of dividend increases in the past - some banks have dividend growth rates of ~10%, very attractive for long term dividend investors.

**Net Interest Margin**: how profitable the bank’s loan operations are, the spread between what they pay on deposits and what they charge on loans. A small bank might have NIM > 4, large banks might have closer to 2.5 as they are forced to compete more on rates. Higher NIM means their profits are more stable (arguably, it indicates a moat).

**Non Performing Assets**: the percentage of loans that are in trouble. An indicator of how good the bank is at underwriting for risks – if this figure is increasing over time, beware! Generally a well-run bank will have < 0.5% of non-performing loans when the economy is doing well. If > 1.0%, beware.

**Where do you find all these ratios?** I use Schwab for my brokerage, which gives access to **CFRA**’s quantitative reports – I think they do a good job on covering banks.

This is all the easily accessible stuff, if you want a deeper look into the balance sheet of a bank and so on, “The Bank Investor's Handbook” Nathan Tobik and Kenneth J. Yellen will walk you through that.

In Sweden we have a company called dividend sweden who helps small companies with financing, in return they get stocks that they later hand out as dividends to the shareholders. So instead of money you get shares in small companies usually pre IPO.

t3_km7b0r,How Do We Feel About Shipping/Tanker Stocks?,"I would guess that some of the dividend investors that have been here for a while have some experience with shipping/ tanker stocks so I'm hoping to get some insight from your experience. I've been diving into the tanker/shipping stock rabbit hole lately and trying to learn a lot more about the industry in general. It appeals to me for a couple reasons, one is that these stocks seem pretty beat up and that can sometimes be a place to find value. The second reason I really like these stocks is because of the dividends that they pay. 

Right now from my understanding the industry was on the right track but with the virus stopping ships from being scrapped has had a short term negative effect. Also trade laws over the past 4 years have made things difficult which could change under a new president. Another issue I see is the world shifting to cleaner energy. I've found a company that I believe has navigated these issues, but the stock price is still at rock bottom so there's something I'm missing here. Especially since these stocks seemed to be correlated to oil until after the March dip. 

I want to learn as much as possible about this industry, stocks in this industry, and their track records if anybody knows anything and can point me toward more information. I'm also interested to hear about if anybody has made a play on a company that has cut their dividend, banking on them restoring it to previous levels and getting some solid dividend growth.",18,0.93,1609217041.0
t3_km5j3p,Why I chose QYLD and similar ETFs and defied traditional FIRE investment norm,"I started seeing so many misinformed posts about QYLD and dividend investing in generals so this is my replies and my justifications for choosing QYLD and similar ETFs and hope it helps people who are on the fence looking for some directions on how to proceed. Don't really care about what naysayers were saying since I have been doing growth investing for a long time but only started to switch recently. 

The amount of misinformation and FUD spread on this subreddit could be daunting and I am still not sure why some people who are so against dividends are even here ? Maybe feeling insecure about their investment choices and need to shit on people on the other side of the fence to feel better about themselves ?

Here are the reasons I chose QYLD and other similar investment options:

* I care about cash flow rather than some growth magic. There was a period where SP 500 didn't grow at all from 2000 - 2013. Growth is speculative and those stocks are only worth as much as the next people who are willing to pay for it. The values are not realized until you sell. 
* Tax is a fact of life. Scared of tax ? May as well stop working, stop changing jobs to get pay raise, stop working hard to get promotion, bonus, etc... Tax gonna get you anyway, why bother ??? The point here is learn to live with tax. You can minimize it but not completely eliminate it. And I plan to move to income-tax free states in the future anyway so I will only pay federal income tax, not state income tax. 
* Some of the returns from covered call ETFs like QYLD or NUSI are classified as return-of-capital. It will reduce your cost basis but are tax-free until you sell your shares which I never plan to do
* QYLD utilizes a tax straddle strategy that makes it very efficient for tax vs. trading your own options. Read this up: [https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/Global-X-Covered-Call-ETF-Tax-Primer.pdf](https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/Global-X-Covered-Call-ETF-Tax-Primer.pdf) and be ready to be mind-blown. 
* QYLD and similar kinds like JEPI, NUSI are a good hedge against flat & down market. You need it as part of a balanced portfolio. Growth is not indefinitely, stocks will pull back. When it pulls back 30% what will you do ? Eating rice and bean rather than selling stocks at their bottom to meet your income need ? QYLD has been proven through multiple crashes to provide consistent income with consistent range that even some dividend etfs or companies couldn't do.
* The guy who invented 4% rule that FIRE people follow like Bible only studied for 30 years period and the guy apparently doesn't know what he's doing. He made recent comment about increasing the WR to 5% during the period where stocks are the most volatile in history and PE is to the moon. Lots of experienced fund managers have warned about a potential flat market in the next 10 years due to PE ratio right now in the unbelievable territory
* I do have growth vehicle: SCHD, VINIX (SP500), IHDG so I am not worried about growth. I only buy QYLD + JEPI + NUSI enough to meet my income need for FIRE then I start buying only growth or dividend growth etfs, no need to keep buying QYLD after I have sufficient income
* Financial security: you will never know when you lose your jobs, when you can't work anymore, etc.. Having focused on income etfs first and keep doing that till it meets your income needs will give you a mental safety net that you could have never imagined. Try switching your investment and have that 5k checks coming every month. You won't give a fuck about your work, your boss, COVID, etc... I guarantee it. 
* QYLD does have its driving force for growth. Selling ATM calls against NASDAQ will get you \~3% per month, QYLD gives you back 1% and the 2% the fund managers will use it to ensure the funds doesn't collapse. QYLD will match NASDAQ returns if NASDAQ only increase at most 2% a month but it will miss the rest of the growth minus 2% monthly if NASDAQ increases beyond 2% such as after a crash, which explains why QYLD recovers much slower. Hence, comparing QYLD vs. NASDAQ is like comparing Apple to Orange, same underlying investments but different return-generating strategy. QYLD recovers much slower in the event of a crash but you can be sure that it will never go to zero unless NASDAQ crashes more often than it grows (which is not possible). However, if you are worried about stagnant values, you can choose funds like JEPI and NUSI which writes out of the money cover calls for lesser income but it comes with some growth prospect. On top of that they are all actively managed so fund managers can intervene and close calls early to make sure you don't miss the growth opportunity.

So my final advice for fellow dividend investors and like-minded FIRE people is that do your own researches and make your own decisions. Lots of herd mentality here and make sure you choose whatever makes you comfortable with.",36,0.87,1609210687.0
t3_km3lo8,The Power of High Dividend Growth Rates,"I know AT&T and dividend yield vs dividend growth get brought up a lot on here, but I think it's important to reiterate the following idea, especially for newer investors. Let's do a quick comparison between 2 stocks that have performed very differently over the past 10 years: AT&T (T) and Home Depot (HD). For this example we'll only look at dividends collected, not total return (although HD's total return was enormous due to stock performance). We'll compare from both a DRIP perspective and simply collecting the dividends to spend or reallocate elsewhere. All examples will use a $10,000 starting investment.

### Dividends paid out over 10 years **without** DRIP:

| Comparison      | HD       | T       |
|---------------------|----------|---------|
| Div/share 2011        | $0.94    | $1.73   |
| Div/share 2020        | $5.44    | $2.08   |
| Annual Payout 2011  | $337     | $588    |
| Annual Payout 2020  | $1,942   | $708    |
| Tot Div over 10 yrs | $8,863   | $6,497  |

### Dividends paid out over 10 years **with** DRIP:

| Comparison          | HD       | T       |
|---------------------|----------|---------|
| Div/share 2011        | $0.94    | $1.73   |
| Div/share 2020        | $5.44    | $2.08   |
| Annual Payout 2011  | $343     | $610    |
| Annual Payout 2020  | $2,414   | $1,194  |
| Tot Div over 10 yrs | $10,350  | $8,720  |

### Dividend Growth Rate Comparison

| Dividend Growth Rate | HD       | T      |
|----------------------|----------|---------|
| 10 Year CAGR    | 19.71%   | 2.21%  |
| 5 Year CAGR      | 23.68%   | 2.09%  |
| 3 Year CAGR      | 25.38%   | 2.04%  |

Note that HD's forward dividend was also increased to $6.00 and T's is still $2.08.

HD isn't the only stock highlighting the powerful effects of a high dividend growth rate. A quick glance without factoring in DRIP also shows Broadcom (AVGO) paying $16,616 over the past 10 years and AbbVie (ABBV) paying $6,876 over only 8 years. All of these companies (HD, AVGO, ABBV) have also beat the overall market in terms of growth during those times. In many cases these high dividend growth stocks will pay more than high yielders once you hold for long enough. 

This post is just an example of why its important to take all factors into consideration when investing. It's a good idea to determine if you want/need the dividend income now or later, as your choice can have a big impact on your future compounding. Someone retired/retiring soon may still opt for T since they don't have the time to wait for a stock like HD to catch up.

*All data taken from FastGraphs and Seeking Alpha*

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER EDIT: This post isn't saying to buy HD, its showing the contrast in performance between high and low dividend growth over a decade. Ideally you would want to find the next company(s) that will perform like HD, as a repeat of its performance wouldn't be very likely.",160,0.98,1609204157.0

t3_kn6u45,Realty Income $O - A stock guide/review,"# Introduction:

Good morning and Happy Holidays everyone. Thanks for the patience regarding this post, holidays have been a bit busy for us. For this review, I will be diving less in the financials since REITs are required to pay out 90% of it's income in the form of distributions, and since it is important to evaluate them based on their holdings rather than strict numbers. Especially when fluctuations in the Real Estate market are taken into consideration.

Please note, I will not be discussing individual holdings, there are way too many to evaluate there, however I am going to link the investor presentation and 10K below. If you do anything with this post, please make it that, check out those slides, they are loaded with very useful company information that would take way too long to discuss here. Plus they have better visuals. Because I am including those links this post will be shorter than my normal ones simple because there is too much information to include in a single post that is better represented in the information they already have.

# $O - Realty Income:

**Sector: Real Estate Investment Trust - REIT**

Realty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company, is an S&P 500 company dedicated to providing stockholders with dependable monthly income. The company is structured as a REIT, and its monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from over 6,500 real estate properties owned under long-term lease agreements with commercial tenants. To date, the company has declared 604 consecutive common stock monthly dividends throughout its 51-year operating history and increased the dividend 108 times since Realty Income's public listing in 1994 (NYSE: O). The company is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index..

**Strengths:**

>\- Very strong tangible assets. We will look a list of tenants below.  
>  
>\- Popularity amoung investors due to monthly payouts and increasing dividends. Dividends they managed to continuously increase through the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis.  
>  
>\- Conservative and responsible spending/expansion planning.  
>  
>\- Diversified tenants w/long leases.  
>  
>\- Occupancy has never been below \~95%  
>  
>\- 23 out of 24 years of earnings growth. (2008 was the one negative year, and only bt \~-2%)

**Negatives:**

>\- Dividends will be taxes at your ordinary income tax rate since they are non-qualified dividends.  
>  
>\- More susceptible to rising mortgage interest rates.  
>  
>\- Expensive compared to similar REITs. (due to popularity).  
>  
>\- Long term health/staying of traditional brick and mortar retail locations vs companies like Amazon.

**Top 20 Tenants:**

Many of $O's tenants are big names. As it stands, Realty Income has over \~600 tenants across 51 separate industries in both the United States and UK. Since 1990, it has grow from  630 properties to over 6,588 properties in 2020.

* Walgreens\* 5.8%
* 7-Eleven\* 4.9%
* Dollar General\* 4.4%
* FedEx\* 3.8%
* Dollar Tree / Family Dollar\* 3.3%
* LA Fitness 3.3%
* Regal Cinemas (Cineworld) 2.8%
* AMC Theatres 2.7%
* Sainsbury’s 2.6%
* Walmart / Sam’s Club\* 2.6%
* Life Time Fitness 2.5%
* Circle K (Couche-Tard)\* 1.8%
* BJ’s Wholesale Clubs 1.7%
* Treasury Wine Estates 1.6%
* CVS Pharmacy\* 1.6%
* Super America (Marathon)\*
* 1.6% Kroger\* 1.5%
* Home Depot\* 1.4%
* GPM Investments / Fas Mart 1.4%
* TBC Corporation\* 1.2%

So what was the impact of COVID-19? Surprisingly very small. Over 94% of Realty Income's tenants continued to pay their rents on time and in full. The 6% that were not able to continue paying include:

* 60% of Theaters (\*cough\* AMC)
* 18% of Health and Fitness Gyms
* 3% of General Merchandise Retailors
* 1% of Casual Dining Restaurants

# Dividend & Growth Highlights:

The numbers we will be looking at here are the dividend and company growth since 1994. Remember that these numbers are not indicative of future growth since they are backwards looking. No one has a crystal ball telling them how companies will grow in the future.

**Current Dividend Info:**

|Stock Price|$61.25|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|51.00 (They are popular)|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.81|
|Monthly Dividend Amount|$0.2340|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|4.7%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|4.3%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3%|

**Interesting Growth/Dividend Highlights since 1994:**

* Compound annual return of 15.3%
* Compound annual dividend growth of \~4.45%
* Dividend Growth of 212.5% (Including Dec 2020)
* Market Cap vs Debt = $21.3 Billion vs. $8.5 Billion

**What if you bought back in 2009?:**

Suppose you bought 1000 shares back in 2009 after the subprime crisis, what would you investment and income look like now? Well:

|1K Shares Bought on Dec 2009|$25,900|
|:-|:-|
|Investment Value as of Dec 2020|$61,250|
|Dividend Income in 2009|\~$1,700|
|Dividend Income in 2020|\~2,800 (Assuming DRIP)|
|Original Yield in 2009|\~6.5%|
|Yield as of 2020 (Assuming DRIP)|\~10.5%|
|Dividends Received from 2009 - 2020|\~$24,000 (Assuming DRIP)|

So, without even considering the stock price appreciation, dividends would have returned you nearly your entire original investment amount of $25K. Again, all these number do assume you were reinvesting the dividends to compound your growth.

# Link to the Investor and International Expansion Slides:

[REALTY INCOME INVESTOR PRESENTATIONS](https://www.realtyincome.com/investors/investor-presentation/default.aspx)

Here you can find slides that present the current company finance structure, outlook, levels of debt, and tenant information all visualized in a very good way. It is too much information to write about here so please take the time to check it out if you are more interested in those details. Much of this information starts on slide 31. Additionally the information can be found on page 34 of the annual 10K.

[REALTY INCOME 10K ANNUAL FILING](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000726728/d57a0155-979b-4fe7-a169-1a9306bf58e5.pdf)

Here in the 10K is all the detailed information about their ownings, ownings by state, individualized income from those holdings, mortgage debt, revolving debt numbers, total income and investments, and payout dispersals.

NOTE: Many of the numbers are can fluctuate wildly due to swings in the intrinsic value of their properties and the overall real estate market, this can make REITs a bit harder to evaluate strictly from a numbers perspective.

# A quick note about the 10K:

It is strongly encouraged you scroll through the 10K when you have time to relax and if you're interested in investing into the company. (Link right above in previous section)

At a glance on page 34, it can be noted that they have steadily been increasing their profit margins over the last 5 years. Yes Debt has increased, but so has the overall revenue, and at a slightly wider margin than debt expansion. This is part of their strategy moving forward and is discussed in the investor presentation on slide 35+ in the link above.

# Closing Thoughts:

Realty Income is popular is a REIT for a reason, it has excellent holdings, pays monthly, has strong staying power even during market down turns (2008 + COVID), and competent leadership with responsible, relevant, and more conservative investment strategies. (This is particularly important during downturns, see AMC vs Cinemark right now)

Again, please check out the 10K and Investor Slides above, there is much more useful information there that would simply take too long to cover here. This was a shorter post to simply get the brain juices churning before reading the information from the links.

Again, thanks for the patience for this post, thankyou for reason, please do your own research, and everyone have a fantastic rest of their holidays. Happy (soon to be) New Year!

Edit: I am highlighting this comment by u/methothimself for anyone looking into the 10k. REIT valuations are generally measured on a Price/FFO, Price/AFFO and Premium/Discount to NAV, which is why the P/E looks so distorted for most REITs as it accounts for a heavy depreciation line item. FFO adds back depreciation and AFFO adds back depreciation and recurring capex. On a P/AFFO basis O trades at ~17x on 2021 earnings.",150,0.98,1609350301.0

t3_knyyxw,"10,12,13 Get Rich With Dividends","Over the past three days I've read (upon recommendation on this sub's menu) Get Rich With Dividends.

Totally changed my perception of how to evaluate and target specific companies as 'perpetual dividend raisers'.  

Following my reading I started my research and targeted three factors:

4,7% yield stock and +
10% annual dividend growth
Payout ratio (using the cash flow) of >75%

To only find a handful... I am in Canada so I also looked on the TSX.  I am sorry to say but the choices are very narrow.  I really DON'T want to invest in BEN or MO... Then on the TSX you might have MFC, T or Emera that fits the criteria.  

What do you all do to find appropriate dividend stocks? You reduce the desired starting yield? You accept less than 10% annual dividend growth? 

Is that book already old???",9,1.0,1609451877.0
t3_knunfl,A question about whether to sell or hold for current dividend stocks.,"So over the last year I have started an investor account and have been steadily buying dividend stocks throughout. I started with some somewhat popular ones (T and KSS to name a couple).  Anyways as some of you may know KSS cut their dividend earlier this year but since I'm new and want to show some conviction for my choices I decided to hold long and probably still will but before I do I want more input. So while KSS dropped the dividend its been steadily rising in price with whispers of the div coming back sometime 1st-2nd quarter of 2021. I bought 18shares @17.70 back in March and now its currently trading @ 40ish. My question is is if I should sell for a profit considering I'm currently not receiving dividends for the stock and the amount of dividends id receive from a full year of owning it wouldn't even be close to as much as I'd make from selling right now?  I'm not sure if holding is always the best answer or if the profit outweighs the longevity of holding the stock in this situation? Please help (and yes I know to take answers with a grain of salt, but I need perspective)",5,1.0,1609437326.0
t3_knrwxd,Dividends for a baby.,"My sister and I have started a custodial account for my nephew to set him up for financial success and to teach him about investing at a young age.  He received a little bit of Christmas money and we are leaning towards purchasing 5-6 shares of T with that money.

Would there be any tax implications for a baby receiving dividends? 

Is this a smart move or is there better options out there?",7,1.0,1609428504.0
t3_knm6nm,Portfolio Advice,"Dividend team, good evening and happy new year! I hope everyone else is looking forward to increasing their passive income in 2021. 

To state this as concisely as possible, I am looking to increase my passive income. I do have a Roth IRA (mutual funds, actively managed, mostly growth, but some dividends) and also a 401k (target date fund) that I contribute the company match. 

Anything extra that I can afford to invest goes in to my dividend portfolio. This is not money that I will need for retirement as it is likely in addition to the two retirement accounts I will also receive a decent sized inheritance. I am not banking on it but it is likely. Due to my other investments and what I stated above I am a LITTLE bit on the riskier side with my dividend portfolio. In short, I would rather have less money now than have more money later for this account specifically... if that makes sense. Not investing for maximum return in the long run. I am investing for passive income now. I reinvest most of it but every once in a while plan to pull for trips or other fun parts of life. I do chase yield a little bit but I try to balance it out with dividend + growth stocks and dividend growth stocks. I have created a dividend portfolio that reaches across all 11 of the major sectors of the market. Most of the companies are blue chip and have a history of dividend growth. Most have high yield with a few low yield growers. A few pure growth stocks as well (hospitality companies I believe will rebound big time). Obviously this will all be taxed, but I am OK with that. And although pure growth stocks may be statistically more probable to perform at my age (27) I prefer the dividend approach for the passive income.

Below is the portfolio I have created. Please share honest feedback on things I’m missing or might want to change. I realize this is a lot of companies to keep tabs on. For me, this is “buy and hold forever”. I don’t plan to actively manage these positions. Once I buy I plan to keep it except for in rare circumstances. 

Currently I hold about 10 if these companies with about $30k invested and $2000 annual yield. I started investing in September. Wish I would have started way sooner.

$VXUS

$VYM

$BND

maybe $QQQ

$T

$KO

$ABBV

$MMM

$AAPL

t3_knfodn,Should've started this years ago,"Finally got my Fidelity account set up and EFT ready! Started off with $2k and put $400 each into AAPL, ABBV, JPM, KO and O. I'd like to begin putting at least $500/month ($100/each) into this portfolio and also further diversify it, eventually working up to $1k/month and so forth. Currently at a 3.11% yield sporting $62/year in returns. Nothing crazy but a start nonetheless!

Just looking for general feedback/advice at this point. I know AAPL isn't a great dividend stock at the moment; I was looking at it more of a growth stock for the time being. Definitely open to suggestions and looking forward to supplementing my income with dividends one day!",73,0.96,1609377765.0
