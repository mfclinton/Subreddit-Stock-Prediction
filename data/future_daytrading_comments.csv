2.  Thinkorswim is known as one of the most powerful charting and analytical systems used by traders, it's offered by TD Ameritrade for free.  There is also DAS which is through Interactive Brokers and costs $50/mo.

4. Research markets and find what's comfortable for you.  Nasdaq and OTC is most common for day trading, but that's not to say that there isn't profit to be made in Futures, Forex, or by trading options.  Find one that interests you and research it, don't spread yourself too thin early on.

Trading is one of the hardest things you can do in your life, it's just the truth. 

now since you made up your mind to become a trader,  it's your job to find your path. 
I'll suggest starting by going into this:

now let's move to the real thing: how to past everything together? 
you have to build a strategy, you might say but how? 
I'll say all day long journal your trades and charts. 

the data that you come up with is raw data and  you have to analyze it 
if the stock does XYZ that means 80% of the time or 60% of the time will do ABC 

and you start building a system from there, 

I need to mention, jumping from system to system and chatroom to chatroom will not come in your benefit actually it will expand the learnign curve and herd you long term.  because you will be move from a place to another and try to learn a lot of different things and try to line them up but they actually sometimes don't even line up. 

In the end .. I'll say find a place to call home somewhere in this big internet world, learn their system, and tweak it to your liking then master it.

Full-time traders often qualify for TTS, but it’s harder for part-time traders. The bar is raised in the eyes of the IRS — especially if you have significant trading losses with business ordinary loss treatment (Section 475) rather than capital loss limitations.

IRS case law and Publication 550:

It’s not easy to be eligible for TTS. Currently, there’s no statutory law with objective tests. Subjective case law applies. Leading tax publishers have interpreted case law to show a two-part test:

1. Taxpayers’ trading activity must be substantial, regular, frequent and continuous.

2. The taxpayer must seek to catch the swings in the daily market movements and profit from these short-term changes rather than profiting from the long-term holding of investments.

IRS agents often refer to Chapter 4 in IRS Publication 550, “Special Rules for Traders.” Here’s an excerpt: The following facts and circumstances should be considered in determining if your activity is a securities trading business.

- Typical holding periods for securities bought and sold.

- The frequency and dollar amount of your trades during the year.

- The extent to which you pursue the activity to produce income for a livelihood

- The amount of time you devote to the activity.

The IRS does not define the words “substantial, regular, frequent, and continuous” and case law also doesn’t give a bright-line test with exact numbers.

My Golden Rules on how to qualify for TTS:

I base my Golden Rules on trader tax court cases and our CPA firm’s vast experience with IRS and state controversy for traders. The trader:

- Trades full time or part time, all day, every day. Part-time and money-losing traders face more IRS scrutiny and individuals face more scrutiny than entities. Full-time options traders actively trading significant portfolios may not qualify because they don’t have enough volume and frequency and their average holding period is over 31 days. On the other hand, a part-time trader with a full-time job may qualify as a day and swing trader in securities meeting all my golden rules.

- Hours: Spends more than four hours per day, almost every market day working on his trading business. All time counts, including execution of trade orders, research, administration, accounting, education, travel, meetings, and more. Most active business traders spend more than 40 hours per week in their trading business. Part-time traders usually spend more than four hours per day. In one tax exam our firm handled, the IRS agent brought up “material participation” rules (Section 469), which require 500 hours of work per year (as a general rule). Most business traders easily surpass 500 hours of work. However, Section 469 doesn’t apply to trading activities, under its “trading rule” exemption. Without this exemption, taxpayers could generate passive activity income by investing in hedge funds and the IRS did not want that.

- Few to no occasional lapses: The IRS has successfully denied TTS in a few tax court cases by arguing the trader had too many breaks in trading, such as taking several months off during the year. Traders can take vacations, sick time, and personal time off just like everyone else. Some traders take a break from active trading to recover from recent losses and learn new methods and markets. Explain these breaks to the IRS in tax-return footnotes. Retooling and education during an occasional break may be acceptable. Keep good records of your time spent.

- Frequency: Executes trades on close to four days per week, every week. It’s wise to prevent an IRS challenge by trading close to four days per week or 75% of available trading days — even if you need to make smaller executions with reduced risk on otherwise non-trading days. It’s not a good idea to have the tax tail wag the dog, and any trading you do for TTS should have an actual economic risk.

Holsinger, Assaderaghi, Endicott and Nelson, options traders with less activity than equity or futures traders, only traded around 40% of available trading days, which is two days per week. Three days per week may be cutting it too close, so try to get closer to four. While we feel the IRS should also count working days when you don’t have an execution, it currently does not as evidenced by the Assaderaghi, Endicott and Nelson cases.

- Volume: Makes 720 total trades per year (Poppe court) on an annualized basis. If you start July 1, then you need 360 executions, half of the 720. The court mentioned Poppe having 60 trades per month as being sufficient volume. Count the buy and sell, or open and close, as two total trades.",2,1518299227,"[['CPA', 1]]",CPA,125.58999633789062,132.44000244140625

t3_8a35rg,dwvhm4i,"Do not chase is the #1 rule of daytrading for a reason. It can be very very bad. 

Stop losses work well in stock that aren’t moving super fast. But on high volatility stocks it can sometimes be hit or miss, here’s 2 examples from experience.

Market stop loss - you might set a stop hoping to sell your shares at $5.00 a piece. But by the time the stock hits that price the bid is only $4.50 

Limit stop loss - you set your sell order at $0.99 but the stock price gaps from $1.05 to $0.95 and then continues to go even lower to $0.80 . You won’t get a notification that your order was skipped over and wasn’t filled so unless you’re watching like a hawk or set a price alert you’ll miss it and get stuck on the way down.

t3_901wd7,e2o4khd,"When you want to analyze price + volume you have to do it in a systematic way and there are certain LAWS of price + volume analysis.

1. You have to first establish the context and know the support and resistance levels.
2. Then you look at how price and volume reacts ONLY at or near the support/resistance levels.

Ignore the volume reaction at levels in between support/resistance.

Let's take the example of MU yesterday. In premarket trading it established resistance at 57.5. Then after open on 2 minute chart the 9:38 EST bar broke out above that resistance on heavy volume and closed near high. Close of 9:36 bar was near 57.4 so now zone is 57.4 to 57.5. 9:38 action is bullish action and you will now be looking for long trades. The best way is to look for pullback back to support and then if price + volume action is favorable, then go long. After the breakout 57.4 to 57.5 area became support, so preferably you want to wait until price pulls back to 57.4 to 57.5 and retests that level in order to go long. For now you don't have a price based resistance level above support so you cannot look for short trades from resistance.

9:44 and 9:46 pullback was on lower volume but you cannot go long yet because price is still near highs and it has not pulled back to support. How do you know it is not going to keep coming down on lower and lower volume? How do you know to go long after only 2 red bars in real time? Just wait patiently for pullback to support. If it keeps going higher and higher then don't chase.

At 9:54 price starts pulling back on lower volume. Wait patiently for pullback to 57.4 to 57.5 support area. If it doesn't pullback to 57.4 to 57.5 support then just don't trade. Usually after breakout from resistance price retests support. That test happened on 10:16 EST bar and price went all the way to 57.4. Notice the reaction to this test. Price opened near high, then tested support then closed back near high, on heavy volume (a hammer or downthrust on heavy volume). This seems favorable test of support but DON'T GO LONG YET. You want to see a LOW VOLUME TEST OF SUPPORT before you go long. **Whenever price tests support on heavy volume and wide range bar, it usually retests support and keeps testing support until there is a low volume test before it goes up**.

10:22 bar retested support on lower volume. You could have gone long at close of that bar with a stop just below that bar (which would also be below 57.4 support). Notice that volume was lower but still about average so it is not the best long setup. The best long setup is when price tests support on VERY LOW VOLUME. 2 minute ATR at that time was around 10 cents so you could have put your stop 10 cents below entry of 57.42 with first scale out target of 20 cents (2 x ATR). This would have given you 1:2 risk/reward on the scale out portion and you would have runner after scale out in case price keeps moving up.

At 57.62 you scale out of your position. Then price comes back down to retest support of 57.4. This time the 10:36 test is on VERY LOW VOLUME. This is the BEST HIGH ODDS ENTRY for long. You go long again at close of 10:36 bar at 57.46 with stop below 10:22 bar. Closes of 10:22 bar and 10:36 bar were two places to go long, and 10:36 close was the better one because of **very low volume test of support**.

t3_901rwa,e2wloc1,"The learning curve to become a good day trader is 2-3 years at least. You will also need to determine what trading style is compatible with your personality, lifestyle and psychology and develop your trading plan accordingly. Whether you want to be a trend trader, or momentum breakout trader, or mean reversion trader, or counter trend trader, or all round trader. Whether you want to trade stocks, or futures, or options etc. The most important things that will determine your success is finding a trading style and strategy which is compatible with your personality, aggressive risk management, discipline, patience and control of emotions.

Following are the areas you will need to learn and master:

1. Basic knowledge (basic terminology, lingo etc.)

2. Risk management (stop loss, position sizing, appropriate risk/reward, appropriate account size)

3. Multi time frame analysis for context determination (whether background strength or weakness, whether trend or sideways range, whether near support or near resistance etc.)

4. Price + volume analysis (Wyckoff method, volume spread analysis, candlesticks, level 2, tape reading, volume profile etc.)

5. Support/resistance analysis (horizontal levels, trend lines, channels etc., swing high swing low pivots, profit targets, determination of stops etc.)

6. Technical analysis (more for short term trading, includes some of the points mentioned above, and indicators etc.). Selection of appropriate instrument you want to trade.

7. Entry rules based on above

8. Exit rules based on above

9. Iron discipline. Formulation of trading plan based on above. Following trading plan with discipline.

10. Psychology of trading. Patience to wait for the right setup. Controlling emotions of fear, greed etc.

I personally decided to become a futures day trader because it is compatible with my personality. I am a self taught trader and never subscribed to any trading school or purchased any trading course. I went to the school of hard knocks and learned from my own mistakes. You should be able to find everything I mentioned above online for free. Use professor Google liberally :)

t3_901rwa,e2nxuwo,"Day trading is by no means gambling, this is a common belief that many beginners may have but after studying the market you will see that it is indeed not gambling. Trading can be difficult and takes a lot of discipline. If you bought on the low of Monday, and the high of Tuesday, you could make money, but only if the high of Tuesday is higher than the low of Monday, which isn't always the case. Your profits will only be consistent if you know what you are doing. But before even thinking about real money trades, you should get a feel for it with fake money aka ""Sim"". 

When it comes to how to learn how to trade, you should watch lots of tutorials, study the market, I even suggest perhaps joining a trading room, which can either be free or paid, depending on where you go, but if you want I can help you find one. Another thing I found useful is watching a guy called ""Mark Douglas"", you can find his videos on YouTube, which will teach you how to get the mentality of a successful trader. Don't focus on the money that you will make but instead, focus on the process of trading, that's what the big traders like to do.

I will say: trading isn't a ""too good to be true"" scenario. You won't make money without an understanding of what you are doing. Take some losses on your paper money account and see why you lost.

It always seems like there is too much information to know where to get started. Take it one step at a time. Definition by definition. Watch countless tutorials. Write down what you don't understand. Research what you don't understand. Move on to the next video. Treating trading like a game without discipline and research is pointless and you might as well go back to the casino.

t3_92h6gz,e35t80l,"Whenever you make a trade remember SETS: size (position size), entry, target, stop. You have to know all 4 things before you enter the trade. Have a written trading plan before you enter.

In your example, why did you enter at $6.10? What was the setup? Where was the stop? What was the exit target? Did you position size properly according to account size? etc. Ideally you should know all that before you enter the trade. Aggressive risk management is very important.

1. Size: Never risk more than 1% of account on one trade. You also have to know where your stop loss will be to position size properly. For example if your stop loss was 0.9 below your entry and your account size is 5k then you should not trade with more than 50 shares. With 50 shares you will be risking $45 (50 x 0.9) which is less than 1% of 5k. If you traded 100 shares with stop of 90 cents and account size of 1k then your risk will be 9% of account which is too much risk and a sure way to eventually blow account. To trade 100 shares with stop of 90 cents (risking $90), you need account size of minimum 9k to keep risk at 1%

2. Entry: You need to know why you entered at $6.10. What was the setup? Where was support and resistance? Was the stock in a trend or sideways range? Was stock breaking out and was it breaking out on heavy volume? What time frame you will enter on? You need to know answers to all these questions. It is a good idea to wait for a bit after open to see range, behavior, volatility, volume etc of stock so you can answer all those questions and then see if there is a high odds setup and reason for entry.

3. Target: You should know what your exit target is. Where is the resistance? Resistance is a good place for exit target. If there is no resistance then you can use a multiple of ATR (average true range) for exit target or watch price and volume action to let price tell you when to exit, or have a trailing stop loss for exit. Make sure your risk/reward ratio is at least 1:1 (preferably 1:2 or better).

4. Stop: Stop should be below nearest support or a multiple of ATR, making sure risk/reward is 1:1 or better. Stop should be at a place where you know you were wrong and your setup is violated. Stop distance will also determine your position size and account size needed for the trade as explained above.

Usually with such an extreme move the stock is too extended and not a good idea to buy after such an extreme extended move. No stock keeps going up in a straight line and there is always a pullback. Wait for a low volume pullback on daily chart to enter again if stock remains in uptrend. Your second entry was after an extended move when price was making an inverted hammer on heavy volume (on 5 min chart) which is generally not a good idea. Learn to analyze price + volume and patiently wait for the best high odds setups to enter.",22,1532736745,"[['ATR', 1]]",ATR,97.1500015258789,104.5

I know hearing all this negativity sucks. We were all in your shoes and made the same mistakes you did.
Easy tips to follow:
- Don't ever hold a swing trade through earnings unless you are holding for years. Than technically it's not really a swing.
- It is EXTREMELY difficult to effectively trade intraday using Robinhood.  Watch a 30 second portion of any live day trader and you'll know what I mean.
- Not sure how much capital/personal investment relative to your personal financial situation you have invested but just make sure you are comfortable losing all of it. If not pull out enough to get to that level.
- Think of your losses as tuition. Dead serious. You said yourself that you learned a lot already. The learning(not losing) wont stop and it'll feel so good as you keep learning!

3. You won't get the high of the day, but you won't blow up in 3 days either.
4. Rinse and repeat.

For whatever it's worth, you need to take a break.  Doing that well and blowing it all is not the place to be.

If it's up, look for opportunities on pullbacks to enter long. Vice versa if it's heading down. Don't try to short on an upwards trending market, and don't try to long a downwards trending market. 

Also, contrary to what most people say, indicators can be useful. It's just knowing how to use them, and that not all the time they offer clear signals.

t3_9nnb4b,e7tk0xg,"When I first started learning how to trade almost 2 years ago I lost almost all of my initial investment due to just doing stupid things and not knowing any better. My first big mistake was not paper trading until I got the hang of it. My #1 biggest tip is to practice practice practice paper trading until you have more winning trades than losing ones. My next big mistake(this contributed to me losing almost all of my initial investment more than anything else) was that I was trading with my WHOLE initial investment. I can only speak for myself but now I trade with at least 10% of my balance but no more than 25%. My next tip is to NEVER get greedy with your trades because that will be the quickest way to lose your money. In my opinion it’s safer and less risky to make several trades that each equal to a .5% profit than one single trade that gets you 3%+ profit. After learning from my mistakes I now have more BTC than I initially started with before I lost almost all of my initial balance. 

One thing you could also do is let’s say you have an initial investment of $1,000, 10% of that is $100 so you can turn that $100 into $1,000 and then you’ll have $2,000. 10% of 2,000 is $200 and then you turn $200 into $2,000 and you just keep repeating that process.

t3_a48u9z,ebcpya3,"You have bad risk management.

I know for a fact that the best traders at prop firms have between a 40% and 45% win rate.

Yet they employ a 2:1 risk/reward, usually using bracket orders with traiking stops.

If your winners are 2x your losers, you can LOSE 60% of the time and make money.

Here's a hypothetical.

I take 10 trades. My stop loss is at a max loss of $1,000 per trade. My take profit is at $2,000.

I win 4 trades for $8,000...I LOSE 6 trades (max loss) for $1,000 each... I made $2,000 anyway losing 60% of my trades.

Go to a 3:1 risk/reward you can lose 70% of your trades and be profitable!

I trade Futures successesfully and also sell Options spreads pretty much every week.

I have about a 37% win rate day trading Crude Oil.

But I rarely hit my max loss, because my stop is trailing.

In reality every trade you take essentially has a 50/50 coin flip toss of working out (for directional day trades).

You cannot predict the market. No indicator or system or whatever is going to be able to defeat the fact that you have a 50/50 chance.

And that's okay! Because YOUR job is to manage risk. Not be a fucking seer.

Decent entries with proper risk management is all it takes to be profitable.

Let me ask you a question...

When you take a trade do you first calculate how much you hope to make?

Or...how much you're willing to lose?

Do you hold onto losers twice as long as winners?

A lot of people cut their losses quick a few times and see the trade then work out magnificently in their favor. And they kick themselves as if they lost an opportunity. ""I SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN!"" GAH!""

so then they start holding on longer to bad trades...HOPE becomes their strategy.

You have to get that out of your mind.

A good trader is a good risk manager. Not a prophet.

Now for SWING trades? Sure, a 60% or higher win rate is doable. You have more information to work with, more room for error, larger time frames, larger room for things to work.

t3_aaqf54,ecu3zp0,"*Second comment from the other topic.*

Losses can't increase your account's overall profit.

Your diallowed losses from the wash sale rule will always be more than you made overall. This is because the loss is added to the next trade as an increase in cost basis. Let's say every trade you make is subject to the wash sale rule. You start the year with 10k and lose 2k to go down to 8000. Those 2k are disallowed losses. Then you make 3k to close out the year at 11000. Your total profit is 1000 or 1k. But you also have 2k in disallowed losses. Maybe you have even more than that, something like 4k or 5k because you made 3k in gains so there were losses along the way.

So you could have these two situations:

You profit 1k and have disallowed losses of 2k. You pay taxes on 1k.

You profit 1k and have disallowed losses of 4k. You pay taxes on 1k.

You don't get taxed on the gains from 8000 to 11000, but only the amount your account rose over the year, from 10k to 11k so your profit is only 1k, not 3k. This is because the cost basis of each trade is carried over into the next trade in the case of a disallowed loss. It's a fancy way of tracking your total account value. So if you make that 3k on your final trade of the year, say it cost you 8000 to buy it with your entire account, and you sell the position for 11k.

\[Original comment from the first link, above\]

market/volume profile is how i analyze the market, and trades are placed at levels based on profile levels and activity.

jigsaw. definitely worth it. my homegrown hierarchy of charts/tools is......

1. the price chart is the broadest view.
2. footprint looks up to the price chart, and a bit down to the dom.
3. the dom looks up to footprint and down to the tape. \[jigsaw\].
4. the tape is what it is and looks up to the dom. \[jigsaw\].

as far as trading data is concerned, newtonian physics begins with the tape.

you can't really see the chart from the tape, and vice versa. however, some folks trade from the tape, only. traders have their ways, but all of us basically do the same thing, and that is feed our intuitions with the dom and tape, and merge it together with FP and the price charts.

RARELY do i enter based on the tape as the first provider, but today was such a day on the ES. a large order 2000 hit the bid at X, followed immediately a tick up with an order of 1000 on the bid. it ran the ladder 40 ticks. that immediate run stopped at a key market profile level. i went long from there for a nice run.

lots of folks sold after that 10 point move up, but that was a baaaaaad idea. no way was that trader going to let the price come down, and he didn't. those that sold had to bail, tapping the offers at market, and this fueled the second extension of that run. you can see this on the FP and DOM.

this was leading up to the selloff this afternoon. whatever institution that was doing the accumulating before the run, put it's MOVE money on the table to jack the market. you can't see this on a price chart, alone \[except for the quick bar movement\]. you need the dom and the tape. FP will show it too and it did, but not as clearly.

basically he needed the market to continue up in order to sell the shit he'd been accumulating.

For example, if you only have 10k and are trading 1 contract, the 1-2% rule says your SL should be 2-4 points, that;s too tight in today's volatile period. So how can you trade your setup and maintain some money management rules. It's simple, you need a bigger account. IMO this is where most daytraders fail on ES. Just because you can afford to trade a contract does not mean you should. ES is margined but most forget how large a margin it is. Looking at your paper trades find your largest loss and then multiply by 50-100x and now you know how much you need in your account to trade your strategy. If you can backtest your strategy over a 5-10 yr period you might see that the drawdown is quite large and that's why you need a bigger account, you will get into a run where you take lots of consecutive losses.

You read right, its a great guideline, general rule is 2%.  Its the golden number of stop losses, as it would take several losses in a row to start really hurting your account.  Before then one should start looking at their strategy better though.

>How do you traders who have been doing this a long time find a good balance when it comes to stop-losses? Or is it possible that my entries need work?

I post almost all my trades on twitter with *some* reasoning if I can, as a bit of a journal.  Closed a trade just a few hours ago, [giving me 20 ""winning"" trades in a row](https://twitter.com/robswc/status/1081056416486567936) (just showing how I'm not some bs self help guru lol).  Everyone's style is different.  My stop loss personally is adjusted for volatility, using a custom indicator (strategy) in I made in tradingview.  I actually made a video that might help! :) https://youtu.be/uRYBW7LKtxg?t=241 that is how to use the indicator, you can find the source for the indicator here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robswc/tradingview-indicators/master/indicators/Average%20Volatility%20Percent.txt

Basically, I adjust my stops to be in theory, just outside of the average volatility for that period.  I think I mention in the video that 2% stop loss on BTCUSD back at the start of 2018 would get you stopped out very fast vs now its a pretty decent stop.

Suppressing your emotions is a bad idea and it will not make anything better so try to understand and find out what causes them and then eliminate the root of those emotions. If you have a solid strategy with stops and tps there is no real emotions involved anyway, euphoria and mix of emotions when looking at a price is another horrible idea to get involved with since it will make you much more likely to start acting out of those emotions and then its gambling.


Basically work on your strategy and after every day and/or week analyse your trades (why did you enter, why did you exit) and make sure you did everything right and whether something could be approved. Once you start doing that and realising whether your strategy works and fits your personality then emotions should be pretty marginal because if you do everything according to your strategy there is no feelings that should come, price could go up or down do this or that, but if you have a strategy then it shouldnt affect you because you dont act based on the price fluctuations but rather on your strategy.

First off I’m begging you not to do this dude. I have been studying TA, fundamentals, algo trading, etc everything under the sun. The more you know the more confusing it gets and I am by no means an expert.

I have a full time job and day trade on the side. Before that I paper traded for 3 months. Before THAT I nearly blew up my practice account of almost 1K... ended up dumping everything I had 3.5 K back in and won it all back on some well thought out (but definitely lucky) trades.

Now I have a 1.5K practice account that I use to continue to practice and perfect my strategy. Doing much better. Win 100, win 50, lose 25, win 200. That’s the gist. But the flaw is you are drastically (and desperately) trying to grow an account (ON MARGIN) at a break neck rapid pace. Remember the key to retail trading (and your biggest advantage) YOU DONT HAVE TO TRADE. You shouldn’t feel pressured to make a trade (only when the opportunity presents itself).  This is a major mental game and you are always always always only one impulsive fuck up trade away from losing everything. Every trader is. 

Exactly what the other guy said, you need 3-6 months living expenses plus 30K just for trading (my long term strategy too actually). You are gonna have to pick your broker carefully, from what I see I like light speed and interactive brokers the best, great quality without fucking you over. 

Most importantly you need to PERFECT your strategy. I mean you are straight up #Trump feeelingggg the market lol. All jokes aside I use some of your indicators. Mine involve Fibb’s, EMA’s, MA’s, BB’s, trendline, SAR’s, MACS, RSI, and Ichi. Do I use all at once? Fuck no. Some are used to give me a gist of the general direction, some are used for SL/TSL when I enter. And the 2/3 mains are the ones I truly use. Once you got a strategy working 60-70% of the time. You are basically golden.

Now it’s all mental. DONT get cocky. DONT think your hot shit. DONT think you did literally anything. My mental state is this. I did nothing but do what the market told me. I take no credit for my successful trades because it was the market tellin me what to do I just read the signs and executed. If the market is acting weird and MM’s are playing their games I take my minuscule loss because my stop is super tight and GTFO of dodge. You aren’t in the is game to be right you are in this game to make money.

As far as trading the opens, I use a strategy based on the moving averages and resistance points. If the Gap opens up above the 200EMA, 21MA, and 9MA, this gives me a signal that it is on the correct side of the action. Then I wait for the first 2 minutes bar to complete. I see whether it is a strong or weak bar. I examine whether there are any points of resistance or pivot points near the action. I look at the stochastic and see if it confirms a trend up. I switch to 1 minute chart to see what it is telling me as far as what the action is doing and strength of candles.

Same on closing where I magically get a much higher bid than is available.  The stream data is very accurate, but the fills are very inconsistent.

What does all this mean?  In real trading you will instantly be down the full bid/ask spread and have to work your way back further than paper trading.  When things get wild (big candles) the bid ask spreads widen up and limit fills are extremely difficult on both buy and sell side and market orders can be brutally punishing.
Such a terrible feeling when a stock spikes up huge and starts dropping and you have to keep changing your limit trying to sell as it falls and you miss all the profit.

While I did this for a while, I came to the conclusion that I don't like that approach — if I'm on a winner trade, I want to ride it for as long as possible and extract as much profit as possible. I need something more than a mental price or profit target to close a trade.

I like the scaling out approach (and there's a lot of controversy there...), but with the amount of commissions you are paying relative to your account size, this is going to kill you.

With ninja if you're only trading futures you don't necessarily need kinetick. You can get their data, which I believe is just basically a CQG feed, and it is much cheaper. Think I paid $21 or $28 for the Globex live data which has most of what is needed for futures.

The product you're trading isn't really important for this exercise, and carries over into any market.

&#x200B;

If you start to see that some of them trend the same, or you like the way the price action looks for some of these big movers, then start studying the surrounding conditions of these moves - especially the point just before these large moves took place. Develop a strategy that will get you into these moves every time they happen, without fail. Create rules that are objective and systematic, so you can backtest and foreward test, to get win % and other statistics that give you an idea of how well the strategy might perform over a large sample of trades. (This is just an example - it doesn't need to be big movers you're looking for. In my case, I like things that move a lot, so that's what I looked for)

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter what kind of setup you want to trade - literally just look at a bunch of charts of the types of overall moves you want to be a part of, and create a system that will get you into those moves. If you test that system and it turns out not to be profitable, or not as profitable as you want, either tweak the rules or rinse and repeat the process. It takes a lot of work, trying out different indicators, support/resistance ideas, volume profile, etc. until you land on rules that work for your desired trades. A lot of trial and error will occur, and you'll probably change methodologies multiple times. Eventually you land on something that makes sense to you, is profitable WHEN FOLLOWING THE RULES, and signals trades you are able to execute on reliably (aka not a strategy that requires you to be awake at 3AM each day).

there's SO MUCH information out there and it'll take at least a year for you to be able to sort it into useful / not useful / total bullshit. so just keep it all as simple as possible until then. focus on one or two setups.

personally, I would recommend:

* volatile, thick market (e.g. major index futures) 
* only trade when there's good volume & predictable behaviour - first 90 mins of the cash open is best
* 5 minute chart
* look for ABC patterns: reversals (when stretched far from VWAP) & continuations (pullbacks in a solid trend)
* enter only when a 5 min candle CLOSES above (long) / below (short) the previous failure point
* ride it for ~twice the size of the last pullback (depends on market)
* don't trade into pivots, or prior day open, close, high or low (these are major psychological levels that everyone is looking at & can stop the market dead)
* don't go for breakouts at this stage - they're too unpredictable, it's advanced stuff (fake-outs are really, really common)
* keep an eye on the [economic calendar](https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar) and don't trade during major news events (unless you're 100% sure what the reaction will be)

Lets use your example with 2 extreme position sizes..

1. Let's say you only buy 10 shares. Now you can withstand a $10 drop in share price. 

2. Let's say you buy 1000 shares. Now you can only withstand a .10 drop.

>Retail investors face a lot of obstacles in trading; big spreads, high fees, and limitation with time.

Retail investors can happily trade, for example, the E-mini SP500 futures that

* have incredibly small spreads (0.25 pt, or less than 0.01% of notional),
* for super cheap (some brokers are offering 0 commissions for the Micro version of the contract for many months, and a ton of very good brokers offer commissions in the range of $0.20 - $1 for a total round-trip cost of $1.50-$4, even for very low volume traders), which
* trade nearly 24h a day, 5 days a week.

Same thing would apply for another huge number of markets.

&#x200B;

>for the now price. \[...\] you can actually Buy or Sell the SP500 (shorting is instant with no interest expense) on the weekend no problem.

What exactly do you mean by that?

The S&P 500 stocks don't trade during the weekends, so there's no such thing as the ""now"" price (also, I'd argue there's no such thing as the ""now"" price *ever* — there's only the ""last"" price which is in the past, and the ""bid"" and the ""ask"" which are in the future, but ""now"" is undefined).

Also, a few other things: when you short something like SPY, there's no interest expense: there's interest income! You'll have positive cash balance for which any decent broker will pay *you* interest. The borrowing interest is usually much less than the interest paid to you, for a net positive interest paid to you. Shorting SP500 by selling SPY, or by shorting the E-mini S&P 500 futures, for example, is also ""instant"", whatever you mean by that.

&#x200B;

>there is no counter-party risk

There's **always** counter-party risk, otherwise there's no way to make money. In this case, seems like *you* are my counter-party risk. Sneaky.

&#x200B;

>Because asset prices are all different you can technically only achieve perfect portfolio allocations when you trade with a high volume. So we fought this by implementing fractional trading.

Marketing gimmick. There's no such thing as ""perfect portfolio allocation"". You can solve an optimization problem to minimize certain risk metrics if you want, but that will only find an allocation that is good *instantaneously*. There's no perfection.

t3_ctadqz,exjxqmf,"Hey u/nabeelsaoor, just wanted to add a comment regarding Forex, since you mentioned it elsewhere.

Depending on how you approach it, trading Forex is no different than trading anything else.

It's a thing that has a market with a price for which you can buy immediately and another one for which you can sell immediately. There are catalysts that will move price far and quick. It reacts to news. You can see the history of transactions. You can place limit orders, market orders, stop orders, etc. You can chart it. You can even see decent volume and order flow information if you look at the futures that correspond the the Forex pairs you are trading.

Certainly, some things will be a bit different. The way it moves, the way it reacts to news, the kinds of macroeconomic events that have impact on price, will all be different. But that's just a matter of learning and getting used to it. Similar to how one stock might have a different personality than another (although the ""personality difference"" from Forex to a stock might be a big greater than from one stock to another stock).

The fact that it's a ""currency pair"" doesn't really matter from a price action perspective. Let's look at one pair: for example, take the EUR/USD. That's really just ""the price of the Euro currency"" (quoted in U.S. dollars). Just a price. You could think of this similarly for a stock. Say, ""AAPL/USD"" — the price of one share o Apple stock, ""quoted in U.S. dollars"". Just like when you acquire AAPL you give U.S. dollars, when you buy the EUR/USD pair, you acquire EUR and you give U.S. dollars. It's essentially the same thing that's happening.

The one year you spent studying stocks wouldn't be wasted if you decide to trade a different product (such as Forex), especially since from what I could gather you didn't trade live yet. Once you start trading live, then you truly start getting a feel for the nuances of different products, but the trading mechanics and the price action basics, it's all the same.

That being said, Forex isn't my thing. I don't like the way it moves — I got used to trading completely different types of products. There's also the fact that I don't like that it's decentralized — I prefer to have an exchange and a clearing house being the middle man rather than a typically much smaller entity like a broker. Finally, a very long time ago I lost what to me was a huge amount of money at the time, so there's some negative psychology for me there as well.

Finally, like others said, you might be able to trade Crypto. Same spiel as above — call it ""product X"", there's price action, charts, historical data, bids, asks, limit orders, etc. There are lots of exchanges around the world, you might be able to find one either accepts people from Iraq or that are completely anonymous.

>11. I will walk away and won’t trade once I see some money on the table to give me good monthly income.

I usually prefer to trade without a profit target. If I walk away, I could miss out on a bunch of good trades.

The most recent example is from today. I was trading the ES, and had made a decent chunk of money as the market was going down to the \~2965 area (around 1300 EST). The rhythm changed a lot, the excitement went away for way over 1h. Small moves, much lower volume. I could definitely have walked away, and it would have been a good day. Instead, I stayed. Trump tweeted, pushing the market up around 18 points very quickly, and I was able to get around 1/3 of that movement, the final part. And then the market came back down, and I got around 1/2 of that move down.

A good day became a *very* good one, just because I stayed longer of walking away after an arbitrary ""profit target"".

&#x200B;

>13. \[...\] I have been in trades that could give me $5000-30000 in single trade but I get our with 1000-2000 and then watch myself fall it further and end up chasing and lose what I made.

For quite sometime, I've been very hard on myself on situations like what you describe there — e.g., I made $2k on a trade that could have given me $10k. This would make me angry, frustrated, which greatly decreased my subsequent performance (e.g., like you said, I would very often ""lose what I made"").

I would focus more on something like, ""damn, I lost $8k, since I could have made $10k on this move but I only made $2k"". I would feel like an idiot who lost a ton of money. While in fact, I actually made some money.

What really helped me was to realize that I most likely *couldn't* have made $10k. *After the fact* it might be clear where I could have entered and exited the trade. But this is confirmation bias. In real-time, things are very different. What I could do is look back and try to adapt my trading to get more out of that max $10k that was available.

Took me a while to improve on this!

&#x200B;

>16. LASTLY I WILL FOCUS ON WINNING TRADES SO WILL ONLY TAKE HIGHEST PROBABILITY TRADES. I want to keep my win ratio over 70%.

Like r/provoko mentioned, ""win ratio"" could be a problem. Could be very misleading. E.g., if you take just random trades all day long, and you configure a take-profit order at a 1 tick profit, and a stop-loss order at a 10 tick loss, you'll probably do even better than 70% win rate. But you'll most likely end up losing a ton of money.

Also, many option traders focus on using strategies that have very high win probabilities — you can construct options positions with whatever probability you want. But usually the higher the probability of winning, the smaller the win will be and the larger the loss will be. Many beginners get their accounts wiped out because of 1 loss that was considered extremely unlikely.

For me, personally, looking at a ""win ratio"" isn't very helpful. The metric I want to optimize is my daily gains, and in my experience there's little correlation between daily gains and win ratio.

A somewhat distinct metric I like to look at, and that I found to have significant correlation with my daily performance, is the amount of commissions I pay as a percentage of my gains. I mainly trade futures with IB, so I pay a per-contract fee. For ""fixed commissions"" structure (e.g., $5 regardless of trade size), such a metric probably wouldn't be very relevant. Today was a very good trading day — I paid about \~6.3% of my gross profits in commissions. On a bad day, this could be somewhere around 20% to 30%. On an incredible day (which is usually due to being excessively lucky), this could be around or less than 1%.",3,1569368092,[],,,

t3_d944mu,f1emulr,No point playing with real money until you become consistently profitable in simulated trading. Then you will no doubt grow a live account with the skills you learned.,2,1569425783,[],,,
t3_d944mu,f1gv2v4,"Trading is hard, both a mental standpoint and developing a method that is flexible for all markets volatilities. But, it's never ""stupidity"" that causes the losses as it is not a matter of IQ. Our DNA is not programmed to think on such short term intervals (in my opinion), and our intuition misguides us. Sadly, paper trading or any other method of short cuts may not yield positive results. 

What in my opinion a trader needs is an objective evaluation that he could see objectively what he/she does. However, then the challenge becomes how do you become conscious of your mistakes and how do you attribute the right success factors to your P&L. I suggest looking at a tool called EdgeWonk that shows you precisely your drawbacks, your strengths, and the areas that you need to improve. Again, relying on your intuition to improve things will not yield the ideal results, in my opinion. 

When they say trading is a business, they neglect to say that it's a highly analytical business and you need to create rules that jive with your temperament. This could lead to a reduction of trades and focusing on higher odd trades. If you see that your analysis leads you down the right path, you will automatically do the same thing over and over. Your goal is to make your trading boring as it can be. Good Luck!

t3_ddemnw,f2hoqrr,"Firstly, the 90-95% failure rate for retail traders is a real number that was found from talking to brokers a few decades ago. Brokers are constantly seeking new traders because so many of them lose everything.

Secondly, options trading in the stock market is relatively straightforward, and you can do it with a small account because options are leverage on shares. In other words, you won't blow out your account at a 2% loss in 1 trade like you can do in forex with huge leverage. Let's say you have 1x leverage. If price drops 50%, you're done. Now if you have 100x leverage, your total loss happens much earlier. I can't math right now but I'll assume it would happen at -1% or 2%.

With options, what you see is what you get. The option premium itself moves, but until that hits 100% loss, you still have money there. So it's simpler to manage vs leveraged forex trading.

Thirdly, you need to take things very seriously to have any hope of winning. You know all of those free trading tutorial videos on YouTube? Most of them are wrong. Very few of them will actually tell you why something happens. Instead they just give you a strategy without explaining why it is a higher probability strategy.

There are many gimmicks out there that are totally wrong. For example, RSI is a bounded strength indicator. It measures relative strength by looking at recent candles' gains vs losses. The more gains there are, and the higher their average vs the average losses, the higher RSI is. 

The problem with RSI is it can only go as far as 0 to 100. It can't go to 101. Therefore it is NOT a good idea to call 70-80+ RSI ""overbought."" The same applies to low RSI and the term oversold. It's simply wrong. Like I said, many YouTube channels will simply say, buy at low RSI. That's not a great idea considering the stock would be at its weakest at that point.

What you need to figure out is which indicators are doing what, and then put a few of them together and use logic to help you come up with reasons why such and such an entry is better than another.

When your money is on the line, you want the highest winrate possible, with the highest reward possible, and not necessarily the least risk possible, but you certainly want relatively low risk.

I'm just concerned that you might be diving in headfirst into daytrading after you held a trade far beyond where your risk should have been.

> Hello guys i have been ""long term investing"" for like 1.5 year

I wouldn't use whatever experience you had during that time to help you make decisions today — 1.5yr isn't ""long term investing"" (like you seem to understand well based on your comments in other posts).

> It sounded sketchy at first and backed by statistics like "" 95% of day traders lose money"" ( great way to lie with statistics btw) so i have been hesitant to start engaging in it.

This is a never-ending debate. Some people will swear by these statistics, some people will say they are bullshit.

My take on this is that **these statistics are meaningless.** Trading the markets has an extremely low barrier to entry, so anybody with a cell phone and a few hundred bucks, who's bored one day, can buy and sell something on the markets. It's almost certain that they will lose. Count those, and you'll quickly get to 90%, 95%, 98%, whatever the number is (different sources will say different numbers).

The thing is — if you are willing to **approach this *the right way*,** that is, not as something you do on a 5 minute break, on your cellphone, around the water cooler, but **seriously, as a profession,** then that number changes greatly.

Also, you'll eventually notice that the vast majority of people dedicate themselves far less than they believe they do.

> So my goal now is to grow my account to 5000 dollars and after that having a goal of ~20% per month

Doable. ***But extremely hard***, especially in the first few years of day trading (and don't count that 1.5yr you mentioned here, as they are almost completely useless).

To put that into perspective, that number translates to making around 0.8% a day.

Some people will say you are out of your mind with that number, as they'll calculate you're talking about making 790% a year, and will then compare with the SP500 or something which returns ~7%/yr, give or take. That argument is bullshit, as it's comparing two things that are absolutely different — passive investing in an index vs profiting from intraday movements. There's no energy or effort put into passive index investing; there's a *tremendous* amount of energy and effort put into making 0.8% a day.

To end this topic, I'd say that if you approach day trading with this mindset, you likely have a very small chance of succeeding. Remember, this is a profession, not a get-rich-quick scheme.

> most of the times i see you guys suggesting the FX market as an easier way to grow a small account

This is probably because of leverage. With FX, in many places you can have insane leverage. The problem is that it also greatly increases your risk of ruin (i.e., getting your account value to $0 — or less — and then you don't have money to open a new trade to recover; ruin).

While you're learning, it's probably safer to use little or no leverage. That will really teach you skills that you can use later when you start using leverage.

Finally, regarding spot FX, I don't like it. There's no central, regulated market place, it's a big mess of decentralized, interconnected banks, dealers, brokers. If you do like the way currencies move, and you want to trade them, there are incredible better ways to do it — there are currency ETFs, and there are currency Futures. These all trade in centralized, regulated locations. You won't be betting against your broker that has an almost absolute advantage against you — you'd be trading with the market.",2,1570478022,[],,,

All those statements are usually made by traders without track of history of market / pattern performance or often by less experainced traders. The fact is that market cycles in from hot to colder periods. So for example there are months that are just bombing hot like March, April, August where you have every day one huge runner on small caps. And then there are months such as September that are very cold with barely anything running at all. The usual cycle is that, once you have one very strong runner (300+%) often the month will be quite decent with at least several good oportunities, and more often than not actually there will be almost every day one decent runner for that month. 

And on other hand when you have month that starts with very slow week with barely anything running, statistically chances are that the whole month will be leaning towards slower side. That is the average.

It's not that simple.

Markets change all the time, and eventually the changes will cause formerly profitable strategies to stop working.

In that sense, *having 1 setup for trending days and 1 for ranging ones* isn't gonna work. They will have to change along with the market.

> I have a bachelor’s in cs and have considered going down that route, but can’t help thinking it would be a never ending rabbit hole looking for the holy grail

Bachelor's in CS isn't going to be very helpful. For one, it doesn't mean a person is good at software development. Also, yeah, it's going to be a never ending rabbit hole, since, like I mentioned before, markets change, and your code will need to change accordingly. So instead of changing the setups you look for to trade, you'll change the code that identifies the setups to trade.

Also, don't fall into the ""AI"" trap here. I've seen just too many discussions recently on this sub (or maybe others? dunno) with people throwing the term ""AI"" and it's clear that the vast majority has no idea what that even means. Some of the funnier (in a not very positive way...) comments were even clearly showing that their authors had some sort of idea of using a sentient robot to trade. Nonsense. The correct thing to study here would be ML (rather than ""AI"" — even though some may use the terms interchangeably, there's a very significant difference). Even so, the extent to which ML algorithms can help is quite limited. They may be very useful for certain things, like forecasting trends on certain parts of an earnings report — but that doesn't help you to day trade. It may help with some very long-term decisions on capital allocation for a large portfolio, but that's it.

So, yeah, rabbit hole. A never ending, nasty one. With probably no holy grail in the end, or at least not one that will last any significant amount of time.

> what is it exactly that leads people to say to expect it to take multiple years to learn how to trade?

In one word, **experience**.

There are lots of things that you can only learn through experience. And that means being exposed, while trading, to a large variety of market conditions. That's one reason why it takes such a long time to learn how to trade. Also, during that time a lot of things will start coming together and making sense as part of a bigger picture. It takes a while for the bigger picture to start taking some form, too.

> Am I eventually going to learn that it’s more complicated than this?

Other than as ""words of encouragement"", such as ""yeah! you'll make it! we trust in you!"", no one can tell. It's mostly under your (and only yours) control.

> Or is it the case that I just need to be especially wary of new sets of problems that come when one actually starts to make money that I’m currently unaware of? Are they psychological?

Once again, experience. And a very personal aspect of it: psychology. Almost impossible to tell what will go through your head, how you'll behave, how you'll react, how you'll handle it.

> Does scaling up always lead to some level of failure, even if you're trading with sizes in the same proportion to your account?

Psychology may play a role here.

Also, depending on the market you trade, you may eventually hit capacity issues — that is, trades that work at a certain small size may cease working (or may need to be adapted) at a larger size. E.g., you can throw 10 contract orders on CL without moving it; if you try to scale it 10x, well, you might have trouble with that, you may need to work a 100 contract order more slowly.

> Will $2000 always feel like a lot of money, even if you're trading with 6+ figures, and thus lead you to make terrible decisions? Or are there different problems of a totally different nature?

My experience is that it may get a different meaning.

A very long time ago, I traded mostly for the learning I was getting. It didn't pay bills or anything — for quite a long time, it's been a double income household (me and my wife both working full time jobs paying good salaries). Some time ago I switched to full time trading and don't have a full time job anymore (wife still does). But now my contribution to the household income comes from day trading, so profits are now not just the results of a learning process, but part of them are used to pay bills. New meaning. New psychology.

Goal is to eventually, in the not so distant future, to have profits larger than what our full time jobs combined used to pay. And then, again, I believe it will get another new meaning, new psychology. No idea what it's going to be like — I feel I'll only learn the new meaning with experience.",19,1571791812,"[['CS', 2], ['CL', 1]]",CS,12.479999542236328,12.539999961853027

Also, while price is moving towards my target I do keep an eye on how things are progressing but don’t micro manage.

Ally isn't a good platform to trade options. The commissions are low everywhere, and if it is in any way affecting your trading, you're probably using options the wrong way — in an extremely risky way.

>How do people trade options and make any money? a $0.02 contract increase is a pretty substantial increase in stock price.

A $0.02 increase in the option price *doesn't necessarily* require a substantial increase in stock price.

Each option contract has a property called ***delta***: it's the derivative of the option's price with respect to the stock's price. The claim you made above implies you are buying *extremely low delta*, aka *extremely far **out-of-the-money*** options. For those, yeah, a tiny move on the option's price require a big move on the underlying. It's also related to the fact that there's an incredibly low probability of the trade working out.

If you trade options with higher delta, then (1) you need a much smaller move on the underlying for the option to move; and (2) the option is likely going to cost more. Some people complain that they cost more so they can't buy as many. It's actually a good thing: it *forces* you to be selective, and to not make *YOLO* plays. If that's your thing, go for it. But most people who *YOLO* lose a ton and don't recover.

Very few.

> I feel like I’ve been misguided by all these FAKE stock trader Gurus who actually make money by selling useless courses behind click funnels & paywalls.

You are probably right.

The vast majority of so-called educators are full of shit. They know close to nothing about real trading, and they know close to nothing about education. They only know a bit about marketing, enough to sell their BS.

Also, keep in mind that being a good educator on subject X doesn't mean they have to be brilliant in subject X itself. They need a great understanding, they need to know what people struggle with, and how to help them. But that doesn't mean they need to be independently brilliant at subject X.

I worked in the education industry for a *very* long time (unrelated to financial markets). Throughout my career, I met a ton of fantastic educators who weren't brilliant in whatever it was they were teaching, but they did an amazing job teaching their subjects. Teaching subject X and working with X are things that usually require two completely different skillsets.

> Before I address my situation, is there any trader who can show me proof of their successes before providing advice; establish your credibility please.

Most serious traders probably won't. I won't show anything. No one owes you proof of anything. And probably no one will really think about it too much if you simply disregard good advice because you feel entitled to proof that was not provided. It's your call to use whatever you get or to dismiss it.

> MY SITUATION / I picked up interest in day trading with extra savings I gathered after investing in real estate and safer long term securities / index funds.

Almost 100% of one's experience in those types of long-term investments is useless for day trading. Day trading requires a completely different skillset compared to that kind of stuff.

> I’m an IT Professional with affinity for math / numbers

I have a similar background. It doesn't help nearly as much as one would expect. I mean, if you can quickly calculate a theoretical average entry price after scaling in and out a few times during a given trade on your head, or if you can easily write a script/program for that in case your platform does something funky, great. But as a retail day trader, you won't be using your math / IT skills for the practice of *trading*. 

My day trading improved tremendously starting from the moment I had that realization. I stopped wasting time trying to leverage my math and IT skills, which are extremely good might I add, and I started focusing on learning something completely new.

> [I] had $25,000 within my means of risk so I decided to give it a go.

That's a good chunk to start with. And you seem to be already way ahead of the vast majority of people new to day trading: you have risk capital, and an amount that already allows you to do quite a lot of interesting stuff.

> Admittedly, most of my “education” was from my limited study of online stocks trading videos, articles, blogs, etc.

Red flag.

Education is absolutely fundamental. You need to learn a tremendous amount of stuff that is completely outside of the realm of IT or math.

There are some useful resources on the wiki on this sub, and in a few other subs as well.

IMO, a structured approach is fundamental. Reading random blogs and watching random videos will not give you a concise experience. A full, well designed course (online or not, doesn't matter) will give you a much better experience as each topic connects to other previous topics in a somewhat natural way.

> I don’t have a formal finance / investment banking education from an accredited institution.

Don't worry about that. That's absolutely not necessary for day trading.

> I [...] traded with a demo account between Aug - Oct 2019. I was able to generate over 60% in profits in 2 months so thought I might give trading with a real account a shot.

IMO demo trading is useless. The only value one can get from that is to learn how to use a trading platform: where to click, what are the keyboard shortcuts, etc.

But it won't help develop an edge or deal with  emotions. And those are the most fundamental things one needs to become successful. Also, the engine of the most paper trading systems does a terrible job at simulating the market.

Your story is evidence: the 60% profits you had in 2 months didn't translate to real-world performance. If anything, it may have been detrimental! It could've given you the impression that you were ready to go...

Trade with 1 share of stock if you must. But use real money on real markets.

> I used $25,000 (all within means of my risk) to day and swing trade as a real world experiment while studying techniques using my limited knowledge. Most of the stocks were energy, oil, & cannabis stocks. I lost over 50% of my portfolio in just over a month.

It's good that you have this clear notion about risk capital — ie, the *$25k is within means of your risk*, like you said.

But to lose 50% in one month is just absurd.

Think about it — if you could transfer your completely unrealistic paper trading results to the real market, that is, 60% return in 2 months, it would take you about 3 months in the real market *just to return to break even* (i.e., you need a 100% return after your 50% loss to break even; 3 months at 60% per 2 months is around 100% if you compound gains).

Probably the first thing you absolutely need to work on is ***risk management***. Preserving capital is the absolute top priority. Without capital, you are out. Don't even think about trying to make good money before you are really good at keeping what you have.

> To be fair and transparent, I blame my losses on lack of education and experience. I did not know how to incorporate stop losses, triggers with deltas, OCO, OTA etc. I don’t have a day trading platform (like TOS) that assists in visualizing candle stocks, MACD, RSI etc. I have the basic TD web broker platform. I take responsibility for the aforementioned.

You demonstrate an incredible amount of clarity. So you know a lot of what you need to work on.

> 1. IF day trading is actually a plausible means to generate consistent profits, where can I look to gain QUALITY education? I don’t mind taking certifications or even an online diploma / university course.

Certifications are completely useless. Their only purpose is to prove something to someone — and in the vast majority of cases, having a certification doesn't translate to having any knowledge. I'm an extremely skilled test-taker; I'd probably be able to have pretty good scores on most certifications even if I knew close to nothing about their subjects...

From my experience, university courses or online diplomas won't teach you anything really useful related to day trading.

The education that will work for you greatly depends on what products you want to trade, and the trading style that you'll develop.

I don't day trade stocks, which is what you talked about, so I can't help you with what are good resources for that.

> 2. What techniques and key variables should I be looking for while trading / investing until I get “formally” educated? I need to make a 100% return to offset my loss of $13,000. Are there any stocks that I can look into which have this potential within the next year?

First, trading and investing are completely different things. You seem to mention them as if they were interchangeable terms, multiple times in your message.

Investing is something that probably everyone with disposable income is capable of and should be doing. Trading is a profession, demands time, focus, and a very specific skillset that may not be for everyone.

Again, you don't need ""formal"" education, with or without quotes. You need to develop skill. After you get your knowledge, it's about developing skill: practice, practice, practice. Repeat, fail, repeat, fail. You'll improve in the process. And you'll stay in the game as long as the knowledge you got on risk management was good enough.

Finally, you seem to be looking at it from the wrong angle: don't think that you're gonna recover your $13k by making a 100% return in one year. And if you do, it will actually be very detrimental to your learn, as it might seem like you were responsible for making such a great return, while it will be due to luck.

Think of the $13k as a *very expensive lesson* you already spent the money on. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a lot to learn from that lesson...

Think that your risk capital is now $12k, and that's what you got to work with. Preserve that. Develop your skill.

> 3. Does anyone have suggestions on how I can build my own SYSTEM to attempt to make consistent profits?

If by SYSTEM you mean some code trading automatically for you, see above. TLDR — don't waste your time.

If you mean developing an edge, it truly depends on the products you trade. And like I said, I don't trade stocks, can't help you here.

> 4. Is swing trading a better approach? In my experience, this seemed a more plausible method of trading.

Swing trading is a completely different approach: you'll be holding positions for much longer. I don't like it because to me it feels incredibly more risky than day trading — it frightens me to hold risk overnight, or over the weekend. When I'm day trading, very often I'm in and out in a matter of seconds or minutes.

The only thing that I'll do that resembles swing trading is trading options. I usually establish option positions that I hold (and manage, modify, adapt) for many days, sometimes a few weeks. With these, I have absolute control over my risk, so that a bizarre overnight event that might completely crash a stock, for example, will not damage my portfolio much.",27,1575435439,"[['X', 4], ['TRUE', 1], ['RSI', 1], ['TD', 1]]",X,13.170000076293945,14.520000457763672

Even a book author like Brooks may not teach how he really trades compared to his books. But most all of them make their business selling their junk instead of live trading. All those ""universities"" and ""academies"" for trading are scams. If you haven't done so I would check out tradingschools dot org and peruse many of their reviews and comments. This snakeoil pool is far pervasive and seems to be even getting worse now as more are interested in day trading having a resurgence again.

It' s truly the modern day ""Wild West"" of financial internetspace where many of these scams are just selling elixir dreams and failed at their trading journey themselves yet learned to fool newbs for monthly or package fees and subs. That said, I'd suggest reading some TA books, and then going back to sim, forget about the loss, and after simming for another half year or longer then going small , perhaps with futures if you don't want to risk using an offshore broker to beat the PDT for daytrading stocks under $25k.

His older book ([here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471381357/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2)) is actually a good primer on TA and daytrading in general ,  imo, which covers a lot, like on working out your own system from suggested elements eventually. An alternative is testing ideas in C# on ninjatrader , sierracharts, or multicharts. futures.io is a decent discussion resource on those more futures oriented platforms. 

5. I primarily daytrade futures. Maybe someday I'll try swing trading stocks again. Emmett at tradingschools dot org seems to like swing trading.

Randomness will always occur in the market. Having a defined, logical level to risk will prevent 1 or 2 trades from blowing up your account. I don’t know of any “credited” courses for day trading education, but I don’t think it’s necessary either way. It seems like you’re trying to trade too many different strategies at once as well.

If you're experiencing a drawdown of 50% in less than a month then one can only assume 2 scenarios: You're either a very very very bad trader with an incredibly low winrate or you're a trader who's expecting more than 10% ROI per month with little to no experience.

&#x200B;

I personally think the second scenario is most common among new people like yourself. You've got a bankroll of $25.000 (well, had.) so why would you aim to instantly double it in a year? You wouldn't have lost $15.000 if you would have taken care of your money management. 

&#x200B;

I personally trade with €15.000 and have been making a consistent gain of 4-12% per month risking no more than 0.20% of my trading balance per trade. This allows me to minimize drawdown when things are going south. You should learn first that all profitable traders are realistic people (I've been profitable for over half a year but I'm not going to consider myself in the top % of traders) and everyone else who thinks they'll be able to trade for a living with just a big bankroll, will lose it all.

Retreat from the market and self reflect, is this truly something you want to do? Is this truly a risk you want to take? Have you practiced enough in papertrading? Have you refined your strategy? Are you staying cool psychologically when losing? These are all questions you HAVE TO answer before depositing that sum of money.

I mainly trade spot gold, averaging 100% a year, here's my opinion on your questions.

1. Where can I look to gain quality education? Sorry to say this but most info on the internet sucks, those who are eye catching are probably done by smart marketers to suck more of your money. Learn from the market.
2. Even if I handed you my profitable system, would you be profitable? **NO you won't.** Because you still don't have the experience and ""six sense"" I developed throughout years of back-testing and trading. You are not in a correct mental state to trade now because all you want is to ""recoup your losses"", not ""following my trading plan and rules"". Take a step back, ask yourself, do you have a profitable trading system in the first place? If you don't have a system in place why risk money on the market?? That's suicide.
3. Yes I can tell you, it's all about Hypothesis forming and hypothesis validation, followed by psychology. Form a hypothesis of if this then that, back-test at least 5 years of data. This is where most people fail, everyone wants easy but if it's easy everyone would be making money. Trading takes effort and experience, you can going against the best of the best in the markets, do you have what it takes to beat them?
4. It all depends on your personality.

My words may be harsh and I'm telling you the truth, and the truth is supposed to be edgy.

What I do is I keep around 130% of the account's total equity in my long term holdings: some stocks and some ETFs, with some options to hedge part of the risk. All this consumes around 25% of my available margin, leaving quite a significant amount to day trade with.

All that is inside what IB calls ""model portfolios"" - they are grouped and kept separately, from an accounting perspective, from the ""independent"" portion of the portfolio, which is where all my day trades go to. This way, I can easily see what returns are due to each long term portfolio, and which returns are profits from my day trading.

When the profits from day trading get to around 8% to 10% of the account value, I withdraw a salary and move the rest into the long term holdings to make sure it's at 130% capital utilization and well balanced between the different model portfolios.

If you use RSI in any capacity, and you often say 'wow, if I only held that position another X days, or another Y weeks...' here's a tip you won't get anywhere else. 

You need to start playing AGAINST yourself and lean in to the moves the 'other side' is counting on you to take. This does NOT mean 'do the opposite'  - in fact, most 'day traders' are usually directionally 'right', but their timing is wrong. Losers who are directionally right, but wrong timing tend to make bold, stupid moves out of spite and discomfort.

RSI is default on most platforms set to 'period 14'. 

1. Explore period-2. Define your own overbought / oversold zones per symbol via some research, screen-time, and testing.
2. Use chart timeframes that utilize anywhere from 1 to 5 BARS per day. That's all you need. Making your strategy as thoughtless is possible is KEY. I didn't say that the bars had to be equal, either. For example, a 169 minute chart gives you 3 bars.
3. Stop looking and thinking in day / intraday. This is where money is transacted between those that know, that those that know nothing. In other words, this is where 90% of traders who lose, lose their money. They're chasing immediate gratification, and someone on the other end is laughing all the way to the bank. 
4. Start looking and thinking in 2-3 week trades. You'll hit more home runs by playing against what 'the other side' is counting on, which is you making a crappy day-trade, or you closing a profit after one day. 

These four pieces of information are enough to make anyone money if you're clever enough to dig in.

That's an example of something that's definitely not on the higher end of reliability.

Gonna do some educated guessing here, just to try to clarify why it's generally the case that highly reliable systems cost money (and are not cheap!). Please, don't take any of this personally! And, like I said, this is a guessing game; it's based on 2 pieces of information that are publicly available: that it costs 0.1 BTC / yr to operate (from your website, quoted above), and that the IP address that rdmp.org is pointing to belongs to AWS in Ireland (from publicly available DNS and whois information).

That's around $70/mo at current BTC prices. Seems like you're running that on AWS in Ireland. That's around $0.10/h total. This means that it's running on no more than 4 ""VMs"" (e.g., 4 EC2 instances, or maybe 2 EC2 instance + 1 RDS multi-AZ) if using the absolute smallest instances (other than the burstable families). More likely, and when considering data transfer costs as well as storage (and backup!), it probably means no more than 2 ""VMs"", more likely 1. But let's say 2. With 2 VMs, it's either web tier + db tier with 1 instance each tier, or web/db all together, with 2 instances with everything. In either case, that's not really a ""production-like"" environment. With 1 instance per tier, there are multiple single points of failure. With 2 instances in a ""all-in-one monolith"" tier, there are scalability and management challenges. In either case, an instance crashing would lead to probably some 60s-300s for the whole system to be fully operational again, assuming a pretty good amount of automation (eg, ASG, or auto recovery, somehow moving IP addresses or domain name settings around as there's no remaining budget there for an ELB, etc).

This is definitely something that could be great ""for free"" or ""with a donation"". Probably for a ""hobbyist consumer"" — someone who may enjoy being able to put together some quick scripts to look up data and then go trading with the info. Heck, I do that myself a lot! Like you, I spent a ton of time creating code to scrape all sorts of web pages, dealing with broken HTML, etc. Then the website makes a tiny change, boom, big chance I'll have to adapt my code. Pain in the ass. An API like that could be a great improvement on that experience! And, best of all: I don't pay anything for it (maybe a donation, some time), you pay almost nothing for it (and hopefully gets some of the cost back in donations, maybe even a few beers a month if enough people donate!).

Great deal for everyone.

On the other hand, I would certainly not use that system for any production-level trade automation. Not even for a production-level data source for my discretionary trading: I would be too distracted worrying that the service may go down, and my performance would suffer.

For production stuff, I need to know that it's incredibly unlikely even at crazy confidence levels that the system would go down. Also, I need to know that in the tiny little chance that it goes down, it recovers really, really fast. I want it to be at least as reliable as my code running in my infrastructure (which is pretty damn reliable!). Also, I want to make sure that no matter what happens in the market, data will still flow, without the service getting overwhelmed. And if more and more people start to use it, it will still maintain the performance.

All of that can be done. In fact, before transitioning to full time trading, that was essentially my main occupation. The thing is: it costs money. A lot of money. So whoever provides that kind of service charges accordingly.

Usually I see the movement on a lot of these tickers happening already premarket. Doesn't that mean that when the market opens the price will jump immediately? Are you counting on the stock continuing to rise/fall and taking advantage of that with an early trade?,4,1582643337,[],,,
t3_fa0lzf,fiv5rdf,"Maybe your system doesn't have an edge when you try for unbalanced RR ratios (1:2, 1:3, etc.)... A trading system can still have positive expectancy even if the R:R is 1:1. 

What you correctly identified is the issue of the trade-off between *confirmation* and *entry location*. The best entry locations have little to no confirmation and the best confirmations have poor entry locations. Backtest your ideas in different ways to find the system that has the best expectancy (over a large sample size of hundreds, if not thousands of trading events), but I think that usually starts with the 1:1 and then work up from there.

So you test your system with 1:1 parameters but also measure in your trade log what I've seen called ""maximum favorable excursion,"" which is basically a standardized way that you assess how much of the moves you're actually capturing on average. You want to standardize it into percentages so that you can uniformly analyze the data even if they involve different nominal amounts (variable stop distances, targets, volatility, etc.) 

An example set of parameters for measuring maximum favorable excursion would be that you exit the trade, note how long you were in the trade, then watch until double that amount of time has passed. Once double that amount of time has passed you mark the maximum distance how far in your favor *that trade would have gone* had you stayed in. Your actual exit divided over the maximum favorable excursion amount will give you a percentage, that is the percentage of how much gains you actually captured on that move out of the possible amount favorable.

So with these parameters and a 1:1 system that you're trading, say that you enter a trade with a risk of 2 points and exit 10 minutes later when you hit your target of 2 points to make the 1:1. You would watch for an additional 10 minutes and maybe the price would have gone to 4 points profit before starting to have come back against you. The maximum favorable excursion in this case would be 4 points, so you essentially captured 50% of the potential in this particular trade scenario within this particular system.

Then you're looking at averages. So if your 1:1 RR system on average leaves 50% of gains on the table (measuring how I described above over a very large sample size, which is necessary to make any statistical work valid) then that means that if you adjust your exit distance on average by 50% of initially planned then you should be maximizing that trade-off that I mentioned above (entry vs. confirmation). Make the adjustments to your system (in this case, a 50% increase in exit targets would mean you could adjust the system to a 1:1.5 and hit your same win% but increase the gains since you're maximizing based on averages) and then begin a new in-depth round of testing and analysis.

So with the numbers and system mentioned above, you could have taken the same 2 point risk trade but instead of exiting at 2 points you have the maximum favorable excursion averages statistical data as evidence that you could/should wait until 3 points to exit (because you know now that  on average you were leaving 50% on the table, and 3 points is 50% more than 2 points). Again, sometimes you'll miss out on those 4 point moves, but you'll also be consistently over the original 1:1 target, and working through this over time slowly maximizes your gains and minimizes how much you leave on the table, effectively nullifying the entry vs. confirmation slippage you might be encountering with an inefficient system.",3,1582754308,[],,,

Let it make its first live trade on automatic today, although I forced it to only look at SPY and only qty 1.  (It's a sort-of learning algorithm sort-of looking at MA's/VWAP/BB/LRSI/Chop(Fractal) mostly at 1d/3m/1m/1s.)

Anyway, waiting from 14:30, bought SPY 4/17 $275c at 15:48 for $6.00 and sold at 15:55 for $6.43 for a 7.1% gain.  (Would have sold for about 11% gain in the prior minute, but I have a slight time delay before it auto-trades where I can cancel right now...so that was a human failing.)  

The stop loss is around a 2% drop (of option price) and the target is around a 4~6% gain.  Once hitting target it'll stay in, but watches the streaming feed for a drop and bails ASAP (well, assuming I let it...).

I’ve used IB’s TWS and am very familiar with Tradestation, having spent 100’s of hours running backtests. In my opinion, TWS was completely inadequate to trade on. I felt the platform was extremely clunky and outdated. If it had been my first platform ever I may have just gotten used to it, but having used TOS first, I couldn’t accept TWS. Tradestation’s platform is amazing for backtesting and I’ve gotten quite a bit of use from the portfolio maestro feature. I don’t like trading on the platform because, again, things that are easy for me to do in TOS are not as easy to do in Tradestation. 

In my opinion:
TWS is unusable. Tradestation is a rock-solid platform and optimal for quants/coders. Thinkorswim is the easiest software to use and suits my needs the best.",20,1586533769,[],,,
t3_fyh1uv,fn039q5,"I would pick IB. They are one of the few brokers who allow you to set up accounts for just about any business structure you can imagine. This alone is enough reason to go with IB because you can set up an institutional account and have sub accounts within it. Not only can you have multiple accounts for different people, you can also have multiple accounts for the same person but different trading strategies.

However, if you're just a simple US trader trading under your own name and not under a business structure, then you have more options. I'd still go with IB in this case.

IB offers the cheapest margin. They offer a choice between low commissions or no commissions. They offer an account that can essentially act like a bank account (though Fidelity wins in this area, followed by Charles Schwab because of their zero fee ATM withdrawals).

IB offers a lot of selection with order types, including algorithmic orders. Often these order types can get you better fills than you would otherwise get. You can set up pretty advanced orders within their platform.

Maybe you don't need cheap margin and only need to use basic order types. In which case I'd still opt for IB. IB have good execution, which matter for just about every day trader. Pretty much anything that is offered by another broker is also offered by IB.

The downside of IB is that their platform has a high learning curve. There's another benefit of IB though: a lot of existing trading tools integrate already with IB. You don't like the TWS platform? That's okay, you can try out DAS Trader PRO (pretty much the gold standard when it comes to day trading platforms), NinjaTrader, MultiCharts, MotiveWave and many others.

However, there may be cases where you may not want to use IB. If your strategy requires shorting penny stocks, for example. IB may not be the best choice if they don't have sufficient shares of what you want to short. So you can look for another broker who does have shares available to short. (Personally I've never encountered a situation where a stock I've wanted to short was not available on IB.)

Whenever I plan on entering a position, whether it’s a call or put, my current strategy is to only enter when it is oversold or overbought. Once I’ve entered the position I can almost always expect for the stock to pull back off of its overbought/oversold price and trend in the other direction. 

Note that this pullback is almost ALWAYS temporary. SPY for example will *usually* pull back $0.30-0.50 off of its overbought/oversold. That gives me a good opportunity to scalp and make decent profits off of the pull back. Positions are never held longer than 1 hour. 

I also use MACD and 3-5 different periods of the stocks EMA to gauge when to enter a pos as well. 

All of this being said, there are some huge exceptions to doing this. During the first and last hours of the day the stock can sometimes completely ignore being overbought/oversold and continue to drive higher or lower irregardless.

t3_g470q9,fnwaymv,"This is a good post. I personally was using RSI to indicate that it's time to go counter to the trend (go short when it's overbought), but due to the momentum recently (intra-day on a one minute chart) it has been more productive to go WITH the trend for short periods. I was entering trades a RSI 70+ that would keep staying above 70 for long periods of time. Ultimately I'd make money, but it would take a while and I'd have to suck up losses for a minute until I got back to even when the RSI returned to ""normal"" levels and the price then allowed me to make money.

What I noticed was when my RSI indicator would go off that it had hit 70 or 30, it would drop back below, then go above quickly, then do it again, and sometimes again before finally dropping down. Look at SPY on a one minute chart. Notice how many times it breaks 70, then retreats to like 60+ then goes above 70 again, and then does it again. There is no magic answer here, but I have seen anecdotally that 3 is the most common amount of times this happens. Then it turns down for a trip back to RSI 30 levels.

So I either wait for it to cross above 70 (or below 30) a few times before I go counter-trend OR I go with the trend, i.e. it hits 70+, I go long for a scalp on the way up. 

I have had a lot of time to watch SPY all day for the past few weeks and what came to be very apparent was when it gets on a run up or down, it stays there defying all the oscillators. Last 30 minutes on Friday was a perfect example. Breaks 70 around 3:15 after coming all the way from 20 then comes down to high 60s then back above 70 then below then above again all while still rising to a very bullish close. It would have been easy to think it was way overbought and ran up way too quick, but you would have been wrong.

On a 5-min chart or more the RSI is much more predictive but still it can stay above 70 or below 30 for a while. Just last Friday, it was above 70 for the first 40 minutes of trading on a 5-min chart.",3,1587314903,"[['RSI', 6]]",RSI,9.789999961853027,10.0

The first one is when every pre-condition is met (the stock over extended , can’t go above pre market resistance or months back etc)
If you enter here you are more of a gambler. Maybe the odds are a bit in your favor but you still gambling more than trading. Some things maybe turn this to less of a gamble (good news / bad news, very high volume on low float eta). Sometimes I’ll take a posting in the “first” entry but it would be small and speculative. I did it today with BOSC even thou it didn’t met my requirements I took a small position thinking on market open it will bounce a bit. Which it did. But I didn’t gain a lot , on the other hand I didn’t lose. If it was coming lower at market open I would lose maybe $20 and I gained $160. Nothing to big. Just a small speculative position.

The second entry is at the confirmation. Which means you got your system a confirmation signal and then entered. The down side is you have to let some of the potential gains go. The upper side is that you know it’s already playing your way and you just swoop in the meat of the move. 

So if you think a stock will go down because it’s already 120% it doesn’t necessarily true. It can turn out to be a multi day runner only on people who get squeezed.

How likely are you to capitalize on the time it does work if you plan on letting losses balloon now? A profitable trading system requires that you allow more than enough room to be wrong.

We are in a bull trap that will end soon. We should retest the bottom and then continue lower over the next 2-3 months before we see any recovery.

I've found mixed results so far (I attribute this mainly to learning and trying out different strategies to find what I think will work best for me), but have been on the profitable side of things all throughout. 

I figured this thread would be a good place to ask a couple of questions seeing how there are people here actively trading minis (ES/NQ etc.). I've found that you tend to get a resounding negative feedback loop looking up the prospect of trading futures online (obviously there are exceptions, but these often look like hoaxes).  Through my experimentation thus far I've found that if you never move your stop losses and accept the beats that come you aren't going to get blown up like people tend to insinuate.  Don't get me wrong I've messed around with the stop losses when starting out...and quickly learned that this is not the way to go. Even with paper money taking a big loss can feel like a punch to the gut.  But enough with the anecdotes, my questions are mainly:

\- what timeframe do you find provides you the most consistent positive results? (I've found that I tend to do best trading less on the 5 min timeframe mainly swing/momentum trading. I've tried scalp trading and although you get a higher success rate the risk/reward doesn't seem justified unless you're very skilled.)

\- What indicators do you like to use?  (I've found the most success with volume, MACD, and an oscillator (I use awesome oscillator) with a 21 day EMA)

\- How do you like to trade and how do you like to structure you buy/sells (ie. how many contracts do you trade at once, do you simply scalp 1 point, do you swing trade for say 4 pts, etc.)

\- the last question I have is do you think it's possible to get consistent results (obviously some days you lose, some days you win) but if you maintain say a 60% win rate (which would apply to swing traders rather then scalpers of course who are shooting for 80% + win rate)

If I could have TW’s analysis and probability UI, combined with ToS’ extensive and polished features and combines with Schwab’s order execution, I’d be in heaven.  

Coolest feature to me so far on SSE is the Walk Limit.  Huge time saver for four leg option orders with a larger overall bid ask spread.  Just set the start, end, increments, the time per increment and forget it while I move on the next trade instead of having to manually walk more order.  I’m sure I’ll like SSE more as I force myself to get more familiar with it.  However, I find myself referring to ToS and TW constantly for stuff I either can’t find or just don’t know how to use yet in SSE.   To be continued....

Edit:  A major advantage ToS has is that you can Google how to do anything and usually find multiple YouTube videos or articles with tips detailing what you’re trying to do.  That is not the case with SSE, but they do have pretty good documentation.  

ToS has been slightly more negotiable on my per contract option fees.  However, I think they’re able to because the retain more payment for option trading order flow (PFOF) than any of the big brokers I researched.  I think this could also be why they don’t execute orders as well at market open open as well.  It might be that their routing algorithm is looking trying to balance PFOF from their 5 wholesale market makers with best execution, which is probably difficult to do well those first few minutes at market open. They initially came down to $.45 per contract, and I recently got them down to $.40. My goal is to get them down to $.30-$.35.  
With Schwab, they only came down to $.50 initially. However, their documentation makes it 100% clear that their routing algorithm searches for the best execution for the client above all else with no regard to PFOF amount.  In fact, it appears their agreements for PFOF with their 6 wholesale market makers is for a similar amount per contract across the board, which helps me believe this claim.   Schwab keeps less PFOF (leaving the trader more for price improvement) and I believe they may get fills occasionally when I can’t with ToS.  I don’t have sound data to back that theory up, but I’m working on it.",2,1597468291,"[['TW', 1]]",TW,54.439998626708984,55.0099983215332

Took 2 days for my “PDF” to come through and it’s just 400 pages of screenshots from a PowerPoint.

I’ve received so many comments regarding how I found a coach/mentor or whatever you want to call it. 

My advice would be to find someone who:

•Provides to you the material they use in their system

•Shows you proof their stuff works

•Will work **ONE ON ONE** with you (not some course that’ll take your money and that’s it). Like literally trade live with you one on one at least once

I found this person by searching through this subreddit and filtering ***Top Posts*** and ordering it by ***All Time***

CJT2013 wrote that post and has given out SO MUCH of his experience advice/posts over the years and is a really transparent and blunt individual. Does not sugarcoat, and showed me his account performance AND has traded with me live. You don’t get things like this in courses

t3_ghtjwe,fsqms2w,"I had tried day trading for about 2.5 years. I found A LOT of success in paper trade and mixed results from live trading. Truth is for a long time I was conflicted on whether I’d be better off just focusing on my studies, and just utilizing those skills to make me money. I’m a Finance major, so I know more than your average person on fundamental analysis which is often used for longer term investments. I wanted to fully dedicate myself to one thing but I was worried that the amount of money I’d spent paying my trading mentor would end up being a scam. On the other hand I was worried the time I’d spend focusing on my studies in school wouldn’t make me a lot of money or even land me my dream job. A lot of traders will make the argument that trading isn’t impossible, it just takes a long time and a certain mindset. Which I completely agree with, but I also think those who do it well and consistently are 1 in 1,000,000. The success rate actually is somewhere around 7% which is EXTREMELY low. I think what finally was the tipping point for me was when I was learning about how to follow “smart money” as my newest ticket to salvation and realizing “smart money” isn’t really “smart money”. Smart money is taking nearly risk free trades, and charging people management fee’s to make trades on somebody else’s behalf. It was at this point that I realized that day traders have every single possible force in the market playing against them. If you can overcome those forces, than good for you.

The webinar and the $2k offer are billed as a one time thing and you have to ""Act Now!"" or it will be gone forever. But the webinar is actually offered 3 times per day and so is that offer, so its just a sales pitch.

You don't miss these trades because of getting the news late. The move is already going when the news arrives; the smart money has programs in place to take advantage of the initial moves without the need to read the news. An individual cannot compete with the smart money, but you can shadow them.

These are higher risk plays and you can get lucky, but understand that it is luck. A skill move would be to scalp 1/4 points after watching the movement for awhile. If you're good at this, you can have fun. But there will be other stocks to trade that day that provide a more consistent return on your efforts and have identifiable setups. But the only way a good scalper may know the move is over is when her stop loss gets blown out. Or not. Getting whipsawed is an unpredictable process. Enter at your own risk. 

No one knew at 11:30 AM that SRNE would go to 9.00 from 4.60. How would you know that was an entry point if you just arrived at the chart then?  If your scanner had picked SRNE up pre-market and you saw the double tap as a trend reversal, you could have gotten in a little above 4 and rode it for a full point. From there, it gets more nerve wracking. 

Cover the chart to the right of where you think you might have entered the trade, slowly revealing the movement minute by minute, until the price falls in a large way at 10:10 or 15. What do you know then? How do you manage your position then? Where do you place your stops? What profit is enough to make your day, based on all that you know at that point in time and with your current skill level?

It's a useful exercise to look at a completed chart and think about how you could make more money from the movement, and then adjust your scanners and your stops and your size and etc. But it's never very useful to talk yourself into believing you *could* have take the entire move. Set your expectations accordingly.

t3_gkxv3h,fquk2ng,"I’m surprised the Reddit subs weren’t filled with $SRNE yesterday. I had the time of my life trading it & made a respectable amount in profits. With such volatile stocks like this, it may be better to actively trade in increments.

Stocks under $5 normally don’t receive this type of attention, over half a billion in volume! I actively traded the stock (getting in & out) buying after breakouts & selling before they hit whole numbers as that’s where most decide to sell or set stop losses. Whole numbers & the 0.50s ($1.50,2.50,3.50) makes perfect for profit takers & market makers who want to sell large block orders or exercise stop hunting.

Few examples of my trades with $SRNE, a mixture of scalp trading & active trading :

- in at $5.43 out at $5.75
- in at $6.62 out at $6.86
- in at $7.64 out at $8.92

I use the RSI, volume, & price action to determine my entry & exits. Once I saw major resistance at $9, RSI stochastic indicated overbought, & MACD indicated a divergence to a bearish trajectory, I knew it was likely heading down once the major players started selling. Selling major block trades by profit takers & market makers triggers a chain of consecutive events of further selling by everyone else until return to a level of major support or return to baseline so I know NOT to buy any further or switch to a short position. 

It would have been nice buying in at the breakout of $5.30 & riding it to $9 but who can actually predict the bottom & top? Trailing stop losses are nice way of riding to the top; HOWEVER if the security has very high volatility & volume, large variation in price via block trading & stop hunting (market manipulation) are probable. $SRNE was trading at over 80x it’s average volume at 500.2 million so I figured I’d rather scalp & active trade from past experience for a stock like this.",4,1589660191,"[['SRNE', 2], ['RSI', 1]]",SRNE,6.079999923706055,5.349999904632568

20 years ago, I day traded in the volatile market of the Dot Com boom. I made my money on the short side. I got good enough at it that I internalized the patterns of many short setups.  I couldn't tell your their names, but I could see the patterns. Those patterns included what happened the previous days and weeks, and pre-market movement, and news, and how I felt that morning (west coast, part time trading before going to work).

My challenge now is not that the patterns have changed much from two decades ago, but that I'm trading in my IRA, which doesn't allow shorts, and LMAO I get so excited when I see the short developing that I just enter a long position at the top of the move with a damnable consistency. So, my old habits still work very well. They just aren't appropriate to the new environment. I'm learning, but it's confusing at times.

Candle patterns still work. They still give you a better than 50-50 probability for a successful trade. 

BTW 20 years ago, very few traders traded short. It's an unnatural act for a human being to believe something will fail; we always carry a hopeful bias in our DBA. I had to reverse that hopeful bias in order to learn to trade shorts. It was faster than longs, moved bigger, and made for fatter scalps. I wonder if that's still true, the stat about short traders.

t3_gt18mi,fs8u6ak,"Re-evaluate what you think is a buy signal in a downtrend.

The pre-market setup was fairly smooth, which is always seductive. One candle on top of the last candle, nice and neat, all the way up. That raised one red flag. 

Then it gave up some distance to profit taking right before the bell. That usually tells me the first few bars will be up, because the mass of retail traders are licking their chops, thinking they're getting a good price at the open. This was a green flag for the first few minutes as a high value, high probability scalp.

The third minute after the open was the high volume mark for the pre-market trend. Some call this the orgasm. That was the second red flag. It was now more probably that the trend was spent and would reverse downward.

The strongest long play was that first three minutes; go long at the open with a stop loss that fits the candle ranges and take half a point to a full point. Nothing in the 1, 2 or 5 minute charts after that looked like anything but a downtrend continuation, which is kinda expected when a 2.25 stock gaps up to 6; that's potentially really overextended. 

The initial adrenaline in the market opening won't last very long most of the time, so take a chunk of that first move and then sit on your thumbs and watch. Most of the time, the trend for the day will be back down. None of the little up moves showed confirmation for a reversal. They were just consolidating within a half point range, then back downward it went. 

Confirmation for a reversal would have had a higher high and higher low, combined with a clear candle pattern (doji, 3 bar play, bullish engulfing candle), and higher volume. The candles at 11:00 seemed like a higher low, and it did climb almost half a point from there. But, the candle pattern at the bottom, an inverted hammer, didn't give me confidence. I scalped a tiny bit but didn't trust that this was a reversal. The downtrend continued.

At 11:38 it seemed like the downtrend had its orgasm; a spike in volume, a bottoming tail, doji next candle. But the doji got taken out by an engulfing bearish candle, so no confirmation of a reversal again.

Consider the range of this stock's wiggles today; it was like every candle was a quarter to a half a point in the early morning. I got stopped out trying to scalp on the peekaboo retracements. Changed my SL and got two small scalps on those retracements. Not really worth the attention I gave it, but it was good practice. 

When every candle is moving this far, be extra cautious. Your eye is probably used to candles for penny stocks moving a tenth or an eighth, and a half is normally seen as a really substantial move in one minute, worthy of being called a buy signal. This was not the case for PHIO today. It probably seduced you in because your brain was misinterpreting the move. Add the question, ""what's the candle range?"", to your checklist for your setups.

Here's the thing about the silence you got from this post. You didn't provide a catalyst for a short term move and this is /r/daytrading. When's the next FDA announcement due out?  What is the sentiment in the pre-announcement bulletins? 

If it's not profitable for us today, we ignore it. Maybe we swing trade it if the setup is strong, but no one here cares past next week for the most part.

Here's another thing: that triple bottom on the long term charts is not useful. Long term, the only useful analysis tool is fundamentals. These predict long term price changes.  Technical analysis is only useful for short term price movement. 

The opposite is also true; fundamentals are useless in predicting short term price movement. The only thing that moves a price short term is more buyers entering or leaving the market. Lots of things can encourage those buyers to come or go, but technical analysis is all about determining when they are there.

One more tidbit: This stock trades like 300,000 shares per day. It's daily trading range is like a nickle. There are many more profitable stocks for us to trade than this sleeping dog. Stocks that are easier and faster to get in and out of. This one won't show up in a lot of scans for that reason. There are higher probability trades available.

Now about that fantasy: the most difficult thing to predict about biotech stocks IMO is the competition. 

The reason these penny stocks are easier to pump and dump is you can create a compelling story about a small, struggling company, just like you did in your post. I'm not saying you're trying to pump the stock, although your tone fits that profile. I'm taking your questions on face value with no conspiracy implied or assumed.

Here's one example: biotech 123 is working on a vaccine for malaria that can save millions of lives per year, mostly children. Biotech 456 is working on something entirely different. It's a bacterial infection given to mosquitoes that makes the mosquito immune to the malaria parasite. Both have compelling stories and would probably be good short term trades when the news comes out of their early clinical results. But long term? Which one will win over the market and make the other one irrelevant? Nobody knows.

If your charts can show you the pre-market action, take a look at 7:00 AM. You'll see the price going up a dime, down a dime, then rising to the high of the pre-mkt 1.67. Then it does what tired mountain climbers do and jogs back down to 1.50 to rest. 

But look at 8:00 sharp. Look at the volume. Really good volume anyway right up to this point and them Bam!  ~1.5 million shares? Who do you think owns 1.5 million shares to sell and buy? That's institutional action. And you can't tell if they were taking profits or getting ready for the anticipated bull run.

15 minutes later we retest the low for the pre-mkt. We casually go up. An hour later we retest the low again. Now the ups and downs are more urgent as traders set themselves up on a stock that's hard to borrow, so shorting may be difficult after the bell. 

The bell goes off, the price opens at the top of the trend in pre-mkt and sells off fast. This is typical, even when the stock eventually, like in under 3 minutes, continues back up. There's more often than not some profit taking by those who were long the stock the day before because it gapped up. That selling en masse is what causes the drop.

If you put a 21 period exponential moving average on the chart, it will help you see the trend from pre-mkt to open session; it's down. You bought into a downtrend. The only question then is what was your stop loss to protect your capital.

Further on, at 10:30, you'll see a climactic after a bunch of other red candles. Often times, that signals the end of the downtrend. That's not to say it's a reversal, as you can see by the rest of the day. But the bears stroked it until it shot that big red one and they were done.

A lot of people, especially those who operate under the PDT rule, feel like they have to use up a certain number of trades per day or week. When in reality, some days may just not be ideal conditions, and you may not find an ideal entry point.
 
This is kind of confusing but bare with me.

 One analogy I have heard, is that trading is like wanting to go to the beach. (The beach being entering a trade that day, and your house being out of the market) Sometimes you go to the beach, and the day is perfect, no problems and you head home at the end of the day. Others, it is rainy and stormy, so you decide to wait for another day and don't leave your house. And sometimes, the storm sneaks up on you while you are at the beach. In that scenario, some people check the weather ahead of time, and decide not to go. Others still go, but leave ahead of time before the storm. Others are there right as the storm hits. Most run for there car to leave, while a few are just asleep, and don't realize there is a storm till it starts raining on them. Those who are faster, or have a GPS are able to leave in get home faster, while those who are slower get stuck and traffic, and end up not getting home in time to beat the rain.

My point is with this analogy is that most traders use there knowledge of proper entry and exit strategies to determine if a day is even viable to trade, or if there knowledge of dealing with certain patterns is not extensive enough.",5,1592965734,"[['GPS', 1]]",GPS,10.3100004196167,13.239999771118164

t3_hgvw1w,fw6fsbh,"You have a lot of stuff on there, but can you prove to yourself that they all... ""work""? Like what is your criteria for including some of those indicators other than ""using them, I have made money sometimes.""

Here's my take: whatever signals you think you're getting might as well just be random. Right now, your system has a negative expectancy since you're losing money, that's pretty obvious since it's based on the past but it's made double-worse since the expectancy is a type of inference about future events, so basically since you're losing money now you can expect to keep losing money in the future. I understand that's kind of a head-scratcher since past results shouldn't determine future performance, right? But if you couldn't prove to yourself before you started trading your system with all its indicators that the indicators would somehow help (with the aid of perfect execution and discipline as well) *generate a positive expectancy*, why would you assume they would naturally? The natural movements of something so complex as the markets are probably *mostly* random anyway that just by jumping in without proof otherwise you should just *assume* that you're taking random signals and trading randomly in a random environment. A coin flip's expectancy is zero, which means on average over time you'll always equalize the number of heads and tails distributed in a system, and although it could take thousands of flips, this represents essentially the aspect of randomness that traders face, especially when it's systematic and quantitative (indicators or even algorithms), as every trade (mostly) in a system will be marked as  a winner or loser, with various degrees of risk thrown on and slippage incurred and all sorts of suction at your equity. Kind of an easy way to think of randomness in the markets is that if you just were to approach any market and, without indicators, call whether it's going up or down a point or whatever and thus you win or lose, that's basically a heads or tails scenario and therefore essentially random. In simple coin flips the expectancy equalizes over time to zero, but in trading the expectancy is negative by default because we pay commissions and slippage in a mostly random environment. You have to grasp the market's inherent tendency to behave more randomly than otherwise, and this is a super-simplified way of explaining things (a coin flip's probabilities are static whereas the market is undergoing so many competing influences at all times that the probabilities are always shifting), it gets real complex when you start trying to quantify the ""signals"" from indicators in pure numbers (that's all indicators are anyway, mathematical representations of past data, which you could read as a spreadsheet and get the same information out of).

So you have to prove that those things you use have value to the bottom line, which means they help you weed out the moments when the probabilities in the market have shifted ever-so-slightly that you have a better-than-a coin-flip's chance that what you want to see happen will happen. Back-testing will get you part of the way there, but it gets real messy when volatility regimes are shifting. Forward-testing on small size will reveal whether your system has an edge or not.",4,1593275165,[],,,

Being a breakout trader, I'm well acquainted with the term 'first candle to make a new high'. I think this idea could be applicable to your ""non-strategy"". At the moment you're doing what is considered ""catching a falling knife."" Buying while the underlying is actively moving down is speculation that we may be at the lowest price.

What if you were to allow the underlying to keep moving down x% and wait to buy until it recoups .5 to 1%. This bears resemblance to buying the 'first candle to make a new high'. Say TSLA was down 4% and you buy, but then it continues to fall down to 6% before retracing 1%. You'd be down 1%.

Now consider you are watching TSLA fall down to 6%, retrace 1%, and now you buy at a far better price. I think this modification could yield better results for your ""non-strategy"" and that you ought to consider it.",6,1593402979,"[['TSLA', 2]]",TSLA,189.70399475097656,275.5580139160156

My initial reaction to your strategy is that it does somewhat reflect the realities of the markets in that the long-term statistical tendencies suggest it will always go up over the super long-term, but you've also chosen to utilize this strategy in one of the sharpest upturns since we had the expanded volatility back some months ago (and volatility is still expanded, with the average daily bars forming at about 3 times the average lengths they were before the crash), so it could be an actual edge going into the future (only time will tell), or since you're always going long, and the market has only been heading up these past few months you're just on the right side of the market for now until volatility expands again.",4,1593349218,[],,,

t3_hi7vxr,fwewa66,"OK I am in the same boat as you.  I am daytrading for the first time although I have nearly two decades trading experience.  I also am only trading only one product (SPX) and over the last few weeks I have asked myself ""what the f is wrong with me"" multiple times (I let a $6000 day turn into a $3000 day last week, for one example).  I think I have finally settled into a groove although there will no doubt be more speed bumps.

First thing is, unless it's the basis of your strategy, I wouldn't trade pullbacks.  It's just asking to get run over.  Once you decide the day's direction, only trade in that direction.  The reason is that if your timing is off, you will get ""saved"" by the overall trend.  Whereas if you are trading against the trend you will never get that benefit of the doubt.  And you will get sucked into a loop where it keeps looking like it will come back in your favor, and then snaps the other way even worse.  over and over.

Second thing is you need to withdraw that cash now or you are going to lose it.  Trade with like 10 grand until you find a groove then slowly raise it up.  Or your education will cost way more than it is worth.  I'm not telling you to paper trade, I think you should have real money on the line.  Just not that much.  As an additional bonus, with less money on the line trading will become easier because it will be less emotional and you won't be asking yourself what the f is wrong with me.  (hint: you are trading too big)

Third thing you need to do is stop when you are down $1000 for the day and just take a time out for a few minutes or even the rest of the day.  You can sense when you are sucking so just stop.  You need to form the habit of stopping now.  Even if it costs you in the short run, the habit will be worth more in the long run.

Last is you need to create some rules for yourself.  It might take you a couple weeks to start sticking to them but the sooner you start the better.  One of mine is to be out by lunchtime no matter what.  I am having a real tough time with that one.  Today was a good example.  I was long and knew it was going higher but sold anyway because of the rule.  It finally settled higher in the last 5 minutes, but I am so ok with that.  Because it trended down most of the afternoon and easily could have retraced the entire day.  I find that the longer I go in the day the worse I get so that's one of my rules.  You need your own for sure!  Even if they are arbitrary, you need to get into the habit of doing it anyway.  I hope that makes sense.

By the way, I do plan on breaking this rule if we get a day with limit downs and vix over 50, but at least I am planning that in advance and not going to just do it blindly when that day comes.  This will allow me to think about and plan around how to navigate that, before it actually happens.  And psychologically, I won't try to break my own rule every single day because I have already set out when it would be broken.  I hope all of this helps.

t3_hmkd4n,fx5u6e1,"I’m still quite new to day trading myself, but will say that any early success can be dangerous and contributes to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. The very best advice I can give is to, first and foremost, establish a good risk management plan. For example, my trading software will reject any orders and close out open positions after I reach my set max daily loss. Zooming in, I have a fixed dollar amount risk per trade and have stop orders set accordingly and I follow my rules (no moving stops, proper position sizing, no changing max loss settings). Shorting volatile stocks can net you some winners, but you’ll be amazed at how quickly such a position can run against you if there is a squeeze. Also, I hear some sentiment of using fundamental analysis in your post (“winners in my book”, “BLNK looks good long term”). That’s not day trading and relying of fundamentals, beyond just knowing what’s going on as a catalyst for a stock, is a great way to get your face ripped off. Learn to trade the price action, not the fundamentals, and you will build a skill that is applicable to all markets in all timeframes. Neither investing nor swing trading is day trading and a lot of people don’t understand the differences enough to keep themselves out of trouble. Figure out which one you want to pursue and then learn that specific discipline. I went through this same progression: investing, to swing trading, and to now day trading, with lucky early results in the latter distorting my perception of the skills required to be successful.

t3_hrj53j,fy4gtqq,"Yes and no.  My opinion is something like as follows.   Patterns represent the psychology of the market whichb is made of people.  People have tendencies and biases and patterns in their behavior.  This shows up in charts.  If everyone was a short term scalper patterns would still emerge because most people would have patterns in their behavior that would create patterns in the market.  

Trading is very fractal in nature so what appears on the lower time frames will appear on the higher time frames. 

Asking if patterns are bullish or bearish the answer is yes.  It's like asking if a single sentence is positive or negative, it depends on the context.  If you get a doji candle out of nowhere in a sideways market it probably isn't going to mean much however if you get one after a long uptrend or downtrend it might be time to pay attention.

Think of it like this the phrase "" a million dollars""

It's a neutral statement.

If i say I'm giving you a million dollars that's a pretty bullish statement.

If you blew up your account and you owe the brokerage house a million dollars that's definitely a bearish statement.

A million dollars is the pattern and it's up to you to read it in context.

TL;DR patterns work because humans like patterns but only in certain situations.",7,1594799317,[],,,
t3_hrj53j,fy583mn,"Good question. The truth is that most people have a fundamental misunderstanding when it comes to what ""patterns"" in the market are. They assume these patterns are things like ""head and shoulders"", ""flags"", ""double tops"" etc. The problem is that they try and identify these opportunities by just looking at the heuristic of a chart. The chart is a *representation* of the market, but the market itself is the dynamic price action combined with static market structure, and is an entity that needs to be represented somehow in some way but understanding this aspect of *representation* is critical. 

&#x200B;

> **why are there patterns in stocks?** 

The truth, cognitively speaking, is that humans will find patterns is most anything. Whether or not those patterns are *truly* there is a different story and requires a much different set of tools to detect. The same applies to financial markets. People will see all sorts of ""patterns"" in the markets, but the kicker is that the **vast** majority are not *true* patterns in this specific sense (must be repeatably exploitable into the future with a reliable degree of certainty). Once you flip your thinking to the other way around: seeing that most of the ""patterns"" that pop out at you as illusions instead of being real, you will start to suspect the true nature of the game.

""Patterns"" as a general term is also extremely vague, and it seems that in your post you might be referencing the classic ""named"" patterns I listed a few of up above. Learning about these patterns is where most beginners will probably stop, because they assume that this is real solid work they are learning about, when it's anything but. You could take each of those named ones and extract information about the raw price and it's mathematical qualities that make it ""behave"" like that. The chart has nothing to do with it but most people who learn these ""patterns"" by a chart have no idea how this ""pattern"" would like in a raw price data spreadsheet. It's all just numbers.

The other side of the coin to patterns is the idea of randomness, and this is the lynch-pin that ties everything I've said up together: the vast majority of market data might as well be random when you assess it's price and data's behavior. On shorter time-frames you can have deviations from the mean but after a while the market will try and find it's equilibrium. Here is the reason why a trader can't just trade the patterns they see on a chart: patterns occur even in random data, randomly! This is the danger of simplifying an approach to detect potential patterns.

So what are the *real* patterns in the market? It's where real imbalances underlying buying and selling pressure in a probabilistic positively expectant (a very specific term) way that *on average* yields *slightly better* odds of playing out than a purely random event (so a little bit of an edge on a coin flip). A real head and shoulders pattern will form on real imbalance in the market dynamics but it will probably look very similar to a head and shoulders that appears randomly and should be avoided. All efforts of the proper technical analyst goes back to learning how to differentiate between the potentially real and the probably fake.

Psychology does factor into patterns. Imagine you buy at the high of the day but it immediately reverses and sells back below the level you were watching. You're now one of those ""trapped"" traders who went long at the high. Your psychology right now when you're in loss could be in panic (most people are at this point). You just entered and it immediately went against you. What do you do? A lot of people would sell their positions to cut the loss, which deepens the turn against the highs you entered at. A reversal at new highs is a potential Failure Test, where the price failed trying to get to new levels. This is a potential true pattern that deals with the psychological makeup of the participants because you can easily see in my simple example how people who bought at the top might panic and sell when there was a reversal against them, and this might be repeatably exploitable into the future. The psychology of the crowd, and what kind of predictive edge you might be able to exploit, is what probably causes patterns in the markets.

One last tidbit occurred to me until trying to think about the questions you were asking. A lot of people assume that patterns work because so many people see them then self-fulfill their promises... I guess? It seems to me that the opposite might be true, which might be counter-intuitive at first. The markets are a highly competitive, and potentially adaptive, environment where the sole element of success is having a demonstrable edge. People think classic chart patterns ""work"" because ""everyone"" sees them. I would argue that this actually causes these to work *less* because of the competitive aspect of exploiting an edge. An edge in the context of a huge an seemingly random environment in the markets is a super tiny chance that you're acting on a better-than-random chance (a true pattern!), but over time as more people look to exploit those same edges then those opportunities will erode, or kind of get swallowed up in the vacuum of randomness before they can emerge again.

As far as your bonus question: potential patterns occur everywhere in every time-frame (true patterns much much less often), but the danger of zooming in on timeframe is that you're now looking at ***way*** more data points, and with that comes much more danger of noisiness in the data, making it essentially random and harder to sift through.

about analyzing price and volume (e.g. is there a lot of volume trapped in the $30 area, so if it breaks it’ll likely create a large flush down, I’d recommend looking into volume profile). For tape and level 2, SMB capital has some pretty solid free content on orderflow reading. The only indicators I’d use personally are volume profile and vwap. You wanna find imbalances in trading, which is created by volume and price, so vwap and profile are the most beneficial indicators in my opinion. I’m not a small cap guy so I don’t use filings but they’re definitely important, and earnings you really don’t need to know about in my experience, I never read earnings, there’s genuinely no edge in trading earnings it’s statistically approximately a 50/50. Hope this helps.

Edit 2: Sorry I can’t believe I didn’t mention this, but I was just answering the stuff you asked about, risk management is literally #1, no matter what. Know what you’re risking on a trade, have a planned profit target in mine. Never, EVER, allow yourself to be in a trade if you’re down more than you said you were risking before you got into the trade (e.g. you say I’m risking $100 loss for $300 profit, and then you’re down $101 and you go “ehhh, maybe this is gonna reverse”, then all of a sudden it’s a $250 loss and you think “come one it has to reverse soon”, it’s a snowball effect and builds bad habits). I only take a trade if I know the profit is going to pay for my next 2-4 losses (I wanna risk 1R for at least 3R, but ideally 5R, so I can cover my next 2-4 losses with one win). Risk management is everything.",13,1595170250,[],,,

Also maybe you are making too tight of a stop. If your profit target is 50 cents away and your stop is 10 cents, make sure you are winning at least 20% of those trades to break even. 

If you aren’t winning 20-30% of those trades AT LEAST find a little more room for your stop or take profits earlier.

t3_i4c5lh,g0hom7s,"Al Brooks talks about the traders equation: 
probability_success * reward > probability_failure * risk
And how winning trades need the positive trader's equation. BUT, he will always mention how there are no perfect trades, since institutions and HFT algos run the market basically, and so it's mathematically fair to assume it will be one of those taking the other side of the trade on every trade, so if you were to enter a perfect trade, a institution would have to enter on a surely losing trade and that just won't happen. Also, an HFT buying from another HFT when one of them will surely lose also doesn't happen. Based on that you always have to give something in return: maybe you're going for a trade you're pretty certain will work, and Al says all this certainty in the market is usually just about 60% and if you believe you're more certain than that, you're liked mistaken. So say you're going for a 60% prob trade with a 1:1 R:R, the institution taking the other part might be entering on a 40% probability trade, but in their case they will have a 2:1 R:R or more, so you gave R:R in return of probability, and the insititution the inverse.

The thing is the market is very efficient, so whenever it is very unbalanced to another side (making it extremely high probability, like 80%), it goes REALLY fast, which is exactly why it happens, because beginners don't see it or can't trade these situations, which are usually fast, growing breakout spikes - the spike is growing and beginners were first scared and not sure if the breakout would be sucessful, and then as the spike grows the risk get's too big and they want to wait for a pullback. The thing is, the risk grows, but in return you're getting probability - it's literally a really strong breakout and thus expect prices to go higher and institutions are entering at the market because they know probability is on their side. It's a whole different story to actually trade these things rather than just talk about them, of course!

Basically, the point was just to say that yes, you can have moments of very high probability and great R:R in trading, though most part of the time chances are you don't have such a high probability and just a 1:1 R:R at best, and sometimes you might have good trades with probability lower than 50% but better R:R, that's how the whole game works!

Of course Al brooks himself will explain everything much better and into more detail, I'd recommend looking up about the Traders Equation and finding some of his content on it. He covers that on his 2nd book of the trilogy, the Trading Ranges book, where he will also mention the concepts of directional probability and etc that are very helpful to see things clearer in the gray sea of uncertainty that is the market.",6,1596663208,[],,,

t3_i46fme,g0ggmfe,"I feel like this is one of the hardest, but also the most foundational, parts of trading psychology. We all like to win and often measure our own self worth by our win rate. This means that losses sting us emotionally, so we avoid that pain by either cutting winners early or letting losers run in the hopes that they come back in our favor. A few things that have helped me in this area:

1. Use hard stops, or, if you can’t, pick a mental stop and just make it deterministic - if price hits that level, click the button immediately and get out.
2. The pain of taking these stops will hurt. If that pain builds too much, just step away and go reset. This can be a 5 minute coffee break, reading/relaxing/mediating, whatever. Come back to trade only once that pain has subsided at least a little bit.
3. If you haven’t read it, I’d highly recommend Trading In The Zone. That book helped me more than any other trading resource when I was at my lowest regarding pain from losses.

As you take more stop outs and become more introspective about the emotional pain they cause, you’ll be able to more effectively manage that pain. This will cause you to make better trades, which will result in less overall pain to the point where you’ll be able to brush off a losing trade quickly and easily and move on to the next trade without the baggage. The irony is that this will drive your win rate higher than artificially padding it with bad habits. It isn’t easy, but this ability to accept losses/pain with detachment and make a good, unemotional trade on the next opportunity is the hallmark of all great traders.",6,1596642881,[],,,

t3_i3vavm,g0gj2xe,"This is great! I just started day trading, and I went down the rabbit hole of trying to find cheap/free resources that could give me a good initial foundation to get going. There's so many resources out there, and here's what I was able to pull for free.

To start learning, I read Andrew Aziz's beginner day trading book- it's available on Kindle Unlimited and I was able to get a free 3 month trial through a quick search (also believe the pdf is searchable). His advanced book that has a good amount of overlap is also on KU so I'm currently reading through that. I've also been a lurker in this sub, and it's been helpful reading what people advise/experience.

On the daily, I've taken to reading the watchlists that u/kant_sleep13 posts every morning. I've been following him for a couple months, and now I'm starting to use the watchlists more to day trade. I save that as a watchlist in TOS and will monitor for any favorable moves. I also watch Stock Market Today by TraderTV- they're a group of excited Canadian traders who livestream from 9AM-12PM EST every trading day. Even though some of the reaction buzzers are over the top, I like that they've set up their stream kind of like a news broadcast so you can easily see the positions they're taking. Plus, they have a guy who reports market moves and news- nice for identifying potential stocks to play in real time. I feel like with this combination, I essentially have a setup similar to the trading memberships that some traders tout.

I know there's quite a few live trading channels on YouTube, and I do eventually want to check out some other ones. It's kind of fun practicing with TOS OnDemand by rewinding back, watching a video published at that time, and paper trading.",4,1596644006,[],,,

t3_i5jp2y,g0slcsn,"I see you're point here, but I think due to the lack of a solid definition of what ""psychology"" means in trading, you've actually made a case for why psychology IS pretty important. 

Psychology is the ability to find confidence in a trading methodology and execute it, come hell or high water. Repeatedly, even during a drawdown. ""Psychology"" is what allows your edge to play out over the number of trades required for it to be profitable. Without being mentally stable and confident in what you're doing, you'd never give your edge the chance to prove itself as an edge. Psychology is knowing that, despite our natural human condition, an edge is not reflected in a small series but in a very large one. That's very hard for humans to grasp, as our society has conditioned us to believe that negative responses/feedback are the reflection of something that we're doing wrong.

So I think the issue here is a lack of understanding, or absence of a proper definition, of what ""psychology"" means when it comes to trading. I don't think finding an edge is as difficult as allowing it to work, when you receive instant painful feedback that the said edge is not working (as fast as we believe edges should work).

 This is all uncomfortable and unconscious, even if we tell ourselves that we're aware of it and okay with it. The ""psychology "" in trading is more like spirituality or faith; that we will ultimately reap the benefits of our toil and pain.",2,1596898778,[],,,

t3_i7a9e8,g11ot7h,"Margin can be very dangerous if not understood how to use it.
If using margin vs waiting for funds to settle is fine as its not actually leveraging.

But consider a situation.

Person has 10000 in account and is eligible for margin upto 4x, i.e 40000.

Now for this example lets assume the person trades with 10percent of loss(only to prove the point, never do it)

Originally the person would have lost 10 percent of 10000, i.e 1000 and now has 90 percent of original portfolio.

In case if the same person used margin. Keeping the percentage of trades the same, the person would now be trading loss of 4000, which is 10 percent of 40000.

So now the person has 6000 left in his account i.e 60 percent of original portfolio(90 percent in original case). With margin the person can now only trade upto 24000 as the account size has reduced to 6000 and margin trade multiple is same 4x, which is a loss of 16000 margin power from initial margin buying power of 40000.

Another important thing to note if you loose 40 percent i.e 100->60, 
you need to earn 66 percent more to get back the original portfolio i.e 60–>100.

t3_i9ymw6,g1ign0h,"I mean this screams downtrend. Several consecutive red candles, tanking through and under the VWAP and BBands, followed by a healthy pullback to test both the VWAP and the BBands on the downside of the two. That’s the first signal, the second is that there was two tweezer top candles when price kept testing the two studies when it retraced from a downtrend (see how that second green never made a new high, it tested the previous candles high down to the cent); you entered because price broke above, but you jumped the gun on confirmation. 

See to avoid getting flushed out like that, you cannot counter trend trade, this was simply identified by 3 things mentioned above that validated a bias towards the downside. You went long too early, yuh should’ve waited for that second green candle above the VWAP and BBands to make a new high (two green tweezer tops), or even close at a new high, then enter. 

I’d ignore the two lower studies (RSI, MACD), especially if you’re not quite fully educated on how they work and how to maximize them. I’m suggesting this because indicators only indicate, and you can’t let them dictate. But aside from this, the MACD was bearish too and the signal line never crossed in a bullish manor to signal uptrend. 

For the RSI, it’s also fairly bearish; it’s close to testing the oversold threshold past 70, looks like it peaked at 65. That would signal that it’s close to being overextended and the pullback (mentioned above) of the downtrend has been exhausted. I would invest some more time into learning everything you can about indicators and studies on charts and sub graphs so you don’t misinterpret the data being displayed which inevitably causes contrasting price action biases and it’s harder for a trader to predict which way the price will go.

I always trade in direction of higher time frames. If trading 2,000 tick, trade in same direction when  both 5 min and 15 min chart are in agreement.  i.e. if the RSI is above 60 on both 5M and 15M there would be a higher chance of success and to let a profitable trade run.  If the RSI is between 50 and 60 on both 5M and 15M then take  long trades but lower your profit target. You can use whatever higher time frames that work for your trading style.

Some basic scalping strategies I use with RSI...

Go long on cross above 60.

Above 60 go long on pullbacks to the 8MA or 20MA.

Go short on cross under 40.

Below 40 short rebounds at 8MA or 20MA.

Short when RSI crosses below 80...extreme overbought signalling possible trend change.

t3_iazya5,g1rve2m,"For the amount of capital you’d risk it’s up to you and dependent on your stop placement. For example, if you wanted to risk $150 on a $10 entry and your stop loss was say $9.75, you are risking .25 cents per share. So $150/.25 = 600 which means to risk $150 on a trade that you enter at $10 you need to purchase 600 shares. Having a higher account balance just helps you get in on larger positions. The risk amount will dictate the shares if I understand you correctly. On this example if you’d shoot for a 1:2 (risk/reward) you’d try and exit at 10.50 so you’d make $300 off of the risk of $150. 

Quick example to check. If you wanted to do the same but use your capital on a higher priced stock you could buy a $300 stock and risk say $5. So your stop is at $295. To risk $150 on this stock with a max loss of $150 you’d be able to buy (150/5=30) 30 shares.

TLDR; Anecdote about feeling good about the inevitability of messing up

I am a bartender. I am a really, really good one, one of the best in Las Vegas (humble brag). Most of the reason I am really good comes down to two simple reasons though. The first is that I actually give a shit which doesn't have anything to do with this situation but the second is because I've been doing it so long and in so many different types of bars, areas of the country, under so many different conditions, and in so many roles that I have done, experienced, and learned almost everything there is to know. There are very few things that surprise me because it's already happened to me or I've already screwed it up before so I don't get frustrated or lose my cool.

So my point is this, any time I screw something up I think its just an inevitable stepping stone to getting really good at whatever it is I'm trying to do (in this case trading) and if I didn't do it now I'd have to do it eventually otherwise I wouldn't be at the level of badassery that I require. If I thought I couldn't be one of the top 20% of amateur traders in the nation I wouldn't waste my time and money learning it right now and there's a lot of mistakes coming before I can comfortably be happy with that title even if I get to where my win % or profitability or whatever metric would you arbitrarily choose would suggest I had made it. Also, this is not an actual goal of mine I just want to be confident in the fact that I am really, really good a trading one day like I am with bartending.",2,1597732632,[],,,

So we're all looking at the same thing, here's a [picture](https://imgur.com/a/myapCrg) of the trendline I have drawn on my chart.

We broke trend at the end of the day and therefore we have to treat it as such. Since EOD action can be emotional and sporadic, we'll have to wait for tomorrow to confirm the price action this afternoon.

The trendline at tomorrow's open lies around **338.35**. This is well above a very prominent VPOC today of **337.95**. An open *above* **338.35** takes the break off the table and it's business as usual with higher prices to come. An open *below* **338.35** and we look for price to continue in the southerly direction, taking out the low of today and yesterday. If this occurs, we put a stop above today's VPOC and target the gap on the hourly chart around **334.80**.

If you own shares of TSLA before the market open on Aug. 31 you will own five shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fifth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of TSLA trading at $1,500 per share, after the split you will own 500 shares valued at $300 per share. Likewise, if you own 1 options call controlling 100 shares with a strike price of $1,500, after the split you would own 5 contracts and control 500 shares at a $300 strike price.


If you sell TSLA shares after the record date of Aug. 21 for TSLA but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading TSLA, Aug. 28 you sell 100 TSLA shares for a pre-split market price of $1,500 per share you will receive $150,000. You will not receive any split shares.


If you buy TSLA shares after the record dates but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split.

t3_ifga6h,g2nzz5n,"With a 40k account and 1% risk, the max you are allowed to lose on a trade is $400. If you're going for a R:R of 1:1 that means you're aiming for $400 winners too.

With fast scalps out of whole/half dollar breaks I think a 1:1 R:R is reasonable, because those pops are usually quite modest (but consistent).

8-10 cents is quite typical. That's where the ""pop scalpers"" cash out and the price drops again. It's a toss up what happens after that, which is why those 10c pops are what you aim for.

So with a 1:1 risk to reward that means your stop is also 10 cents. Depending on the stock that may be a bit tight, so it takes some experimenting with certain stop sizes. Maybe 15 cents works better. So if you aim for the break at $5, you stop out at $4.85 (profit at $5.15).

More expensive stocks usually have bigger pops, but volume plays a huge role too.

Finally, your position size follows from your risk ($400) divided by your stop distance. So in case of a 15c stop, you take 400 / 0.15 = 2666 shares. Maybe round it to 2500.

Of course you can aim for a 2:1 profit:loss, which means you aim for twice the pop (20-30 cents) compared to your stop. Rewards will be bigger, but you'll get stopped out more. It requires more buyers to step in after the fast scalpers take their profit. I learned that for me it works better to go for smaller profits, but taking the stop loss is most important. Especially on tight stops a big slippage hits hard.

A hybrid strategy is to scale out half at the 10c pop ($200 profit) move your stop to break-even (or 1c under that dollar level) and see if the other half can ride up more.

\-Buy pullbacks on lower timeframes

\-Never average down

\-Always track your trades

\-Never blindly follow advice and not even mine, always think for yourself since everybody trades differently

But part of the key to successful trading is realizing that you can't just follow other people.  Otherwise you'll always be late to the trade.  Selling a system makes the system useless because now everyone has it, and thus it can no longer provide a competitive edge. 

It would be one thing if they were selling tools or information.  Things that you can use to develop your own edge.  That's what a good educator that has developed an edge will do.

t3_itisez,g5f9t8e,"We know who Warren Buffet is, he doesn’t need to rent a Lamborghini and girls to prove himself to us in a video and/or a book. But no me knows who majority of the ‘guru’ traders are. That doesn’t automatically make them fakes, but it doesn’t help their credibility either.

And again, I would present the same argument that if I had figured out a trading formula which could essentially print money on demand because it was so good, then I would keep that to myself and continue to print the millions. At least for a very long time. After a long time of doing it, if I felt like teaching others and sharing it and making a new business venture out of it, then maybe I would consider it. But most likely that wouldn’t happen when I was 16 years old, unless I was some kind of child prodigy (entirely possible).

There are the real traders of course who constantly tout risk management, show you their trades, show you their losses, admit when they were wrong, etc, but finding them is like looking for a needle in a haystack. The more commonly touted stuff like “one single pattern traded over and over again made me millions” or “if your chart still looks like this in 2020” is honestly shady at best.

Also, even for the legitimate traders, such as let’s say Andrew Aziz, the ‘teaching’ part of their business is exactly that, a business. They have the drive and determination to juggle between trading and running aspects of a business, dealing with customers, etc. So they take that part of their income stream just as seriously as trading or any other job/business. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing. It can be a great thing and if I know someone is legit, I don’t have a problem paying them to learn from them.

Anyone and everyone starts a YouTube channel these days after making $50 on Robinhood to ‘teach’ others how to make such massive gains, so the market is increasingly becoming flooded with fakes who probably make more money from the small amount of views on their YouTube videos than they do with trading. These are the same people who scream “oh my God, it’s a crash, liquidate everything!” when a mere 1% pullback happens in the market, let alone what happened in recent days.

It's an apple call option with a strike of 111.25 expiring in three days. If you slide the chart date slider to expiration, you will be able to see the breakeven price. The breakeven price takes into account the market value of the option and how much you paid for it. The market value of the option at expiration will be stock price - strike for calls. 

There are multiple variables that impact pricing, including volatility, which you can slide up and down using the slider in the ribbon.

Because let’s say for sake of argument that the trade worked out and the stock went up to $100 or something in the next minutes, you cashed out and you doubled Or tripled your account value right away.

Now, by human nature, we become emboldened and think we can get away with this kind of thing again and again. So next time you may have put your entire newly minted 100k account at risk on something similar, and lose 90k instead of 5k. And that would’ve felt way worse than losing this 5.1k. So even though it sucks, it’s still a small enough chunk of your account to where it’s not the end of the account and you can continue to trade. Consider it a blessing to get the lesson with 5k and not the entire value of your account, and take heed for future. 

And also, while I personally try to have some kind of minimal criteria for stocks I trade, but if you’re going to trade no-name pump & dump stocks like this, you need to make sure your finger is on that sell button and you need to exit with a market order the second things ain’t going your way, no if’s ands or buts.

t3_j1fw39,g6zlo4x,"This is a copy & paste from a comment I made the other day. Hopefully it helps you but this is my setup for scalping.

 

I use a 13EMA (use to be 15) in  particular in deciding when to take a trade. I wait for a green candle  (I use heikin ashi candles) to form ABOVE the 13EMA to go into a trade  that I already wanted to but use that as my entry (This green bar that  I'm waiting to form above my EMA line is in relation to the previous  candles... no matter how green it seems to trend, I wait until its ABOVE  my EMA line) I use VWAP as a form of support / resistance.

While  doing so, I always keep an eye on my Chaikin Money Flow indicator (Very  underrated indicator), which keeps me aware of whether or not I'm in a  bullish or bearish trend (Not 100% but works very well)

In  conjunction with these indicators I have MACD, which let me know the  MOMENTUM of the trend in which my trade is in (MACD allows me to know  the severity in which the rate of change  / momentum my trade is going)

I  trade primarily the 1m, 5m and have 1hr open at all times (I have daily  to see overall view but do not focus much on it) I execute off of my 1m  chart. I always try to verify my execution in conjunction with a larger  time frame... ALWAYS. Whether that's with my 5m or 1h chart.

Please  note that I trade from a scalping point of view and that revolves  around price action, therefore my indicators revolve around PRICE (Which  in my honest opinion is tried and tested method for long term winnings)  If the chaikin indicator is above 0 - .20, I know im in a bullish trend  and can safely ride the green candles forming / vise versa if im in a  bearish trend. I can still safely take a trade if in a bearish trend  (below 0) but aware that a reversal is more of a probability to happen)

I  don't go looking for MACD crossovers but I do keep an eye on it to  further solidify entries. I simply use MACD as a gauge of momentum as to  where my growth will accelerate / slow down (This is also good to watch  for seeing momentum of a bearish trend, which allows to to take an  entry once shown signs of decreasing bearish trend) My trades last  minutes but that can vary how much float / liquid the stock is.",4,1601323065,[],,,

Here are my questions.

1. You had the question about what you would tell yourself back at the start. Frankly, I was hoping to see either, ""stick to the 9 to 5 until X (or forever)"" or ""this is definitely the way to go!"" So, was it the way to go? Did you make the right choice with the right timing? Can you see yourself doing this week in, week out, for decades to come?


2. You strongly emphasize data analysis, and I love it. There are two halves to that, knowing WHAT works and knowing WHY it works. What are your thoughts on a strategy based on what without why?

 Contrived Silly Outsized Example: if I place order X at 10:02 with a certain OCO, it has a nearly 100% win rate with a Sharpe of 1.3 when backtested over 5 years. I don't really get why it works, but it apparently works.

Would you trust the contrived example? Or no, because the WHY isn't analyzed and understood? (In other words, you can't precisely know the risk factors or what causes the small losing percentage.) To paraphrase, what are your thoughts on dart throwing / blind strategy selection ok if it apparently works?",5,1601732924,"[['X', 2]]",X,7.71999979019165,8.4399995803833

Not to ask a question about to do something exactly like you wrote, but when you're backtesting your strategy to calc the stats for it, is there a style of backtesting you do, like is there a specific date or stock you trade on, or is it basically 'go back a random number of days/months and pick a stock'?

Everyone’s journey is different, but I do feel like there are a few key steps that are somewhat generalizable. First is to understand the basics of the market, trade management (like how to place orders), risk management, trading psychology, and basic strategies. All of those things can be had through YouTube videos, books, etc., and it sounds like you already have a good start there.

The next thing, and these kind of go hand in hand, is to find a support community (chat room, mentor, etc) and start to look at the styles of different traders. Find someone who is actually trading for real and has demonstrated success and model their behavior. I joined a community with a variety of traders, each with different styles/strategies/approaches. Some were scalpers, some used patterns, some used volume, some swore by Fibonacci levels - most used an amalgamation of the preceding, but all of them were getting results. Find something that resonates with you and try it. I mean really try it, for a few weeks or even months, until you know if it is right for you. There was one trader whose style I absolutely loved and so I tried to emulate his approach for a few months. I wanted to trade just like him - effortless, having fun, making money absolutely every single day.

That’s when things got a bit dark, and this is what I consider the make or break moment for a trader. I couldn’t replicate his success. My dream was slipping away and it felt awful. Even on good days, I was stressed out about my trading. Through the pain and self reflection, I realized I needed to find another style/strategy.

So I started the same process over again. I looked again to seek out and model successful traders, but integrated what I learned about trading and myself into my new search for profitability. That’s when I realized, as countless others have said, that I needed a style that better fit my own personality. That’s what I’ve done and it has been exceptional. All of those characteristics of that the first trader‘s style - the ease, the fun, the success - came to me as soon as I found my next approach and that’s how I knew I had found “it.”

In closing, my opinion is that the reason it takes some people longer to become successful than others is because some are just better and/or more efficient at working through this process. The longer it takes, the more grit you need to eventually make it. You definitely don’t want to hop around from one strategy or style to the next, but if something really isn’t working and feels wrong, find something else that resonates better with you.",2,1602126551,[],,,

IV (and hence options pricing) is generally relatively inflated at market open and can remain as such for the first 15-30 minutes or so before/if things start cooling down.

And add to that mix something like GME which just experienced what it did yesterday and then the market opens the next day with a whole bunch of speculation on the stock via options, the IV is massively inflated. So you bought your out the money put at that time which was roughly $2 otm at the time as you said, and you paid a premium price for it, because of the inflated IV.  Then as the day went on, IV cooled down, and even though the stock continued to bleed down, as you said your option lost value, or at least didn’t go up in value. Though not exact, but another simpler way to think of it is that there was a lot of ‘demand’ for that option when you bought it and it shot up the price of that option, and later as demand for that option cooled down, the price came down, even though the stock went in the direction you thought it would. 

Your thesis that GME could go down after that spike was correct, but your timing of purchasing the put was not the best. Also, as someone else said, it’s better to buy right at or itm in these situations if you can afford it, because then you at least build intrinsic value if the stock moves in your desired direction and it can help make up for some of the loss from things like IV crush and even theta decay.

Your hope now is that GME continues going down and your $12 put goes enough itm to get you to breakeven and perhaps a profit by expiration. You said you paid $1.40 for the put, so your breakeven is if GME makes its way down to 10.60, and if it continues going down beyond that, that’s profit. Another thing which could be helpful in this trade would be that some more meme action occurs with GME in coming days which spikes up the IV on options and makes your option more valuable.

I'm not a trader. I have been looking into it. I do play poker casually though, and this line bugs me. Does anything with volatility actually fit within neat boxes like this? With poker, you can try to hit some arbitrary number every day, but that's totally not how the nature of the game works. Volatility means lots of up and down motions. If there were no volatility, then you would have a much more difficult time making a gain or a loss.

You might hit your number, but you should never give up good conditions (a good table, whales having a good time bleeding cash, etc.) Maybe this isn't an issue in stocks, but in poker, you're shooting yourself in the foot by leaving good conditions early. In a favorable situation, you want to get in as much as your chips as you can, forget about stop losses, or setting a ""go home"" number. Unfavorable conditions are the norm, favorable conditions the exception. If you cut the good short, then the bad will overtake you. It's just a matter of time. You don't beat the game with a stable market and not much movement (a typical table with professional grinders.) You need some chaos which froths things up a bit.

Also, doesn't ""at least"" %1 each day describe a temporary situation? Again, I'm not a trader or even much of a math guy. But %1 daily adds up damn fast.

Verifying ""profitable traders"" is a rabbit hole I would not recommend going down.  I've done this on my discord where people verify by showing me broker statements.  The problem is that then you get into issues like ""how long of a history do you require?""

You also have to realize that the anonymity is one of the advantages of such places.  Otherwise the people you really want to hear from just won't be able to post at all.

It’s about reading the eb and flow. 

Are the bids refreshing? Absorption can mean a lot depending on the context within the profile. If I see a lot of absorption after a long run, I’m out and looking to see if we reverse. If I see it on the edge of the profile, I know that’s the key breaking point. I’m now playing that break out and weighing up which side has the bigger player. 

did the offer get swept only to tick straight back down again 3 times in a row? That’s potentially just a large player building size before a push. You can’t know unless you’re reading the story and taking in the context of what’s been happening and where you’re at within that profile. 

Are we seeing large players stepping in to push towards the edge of the range? That’s giving me a strong bias until I see someone bigger push the other way. 

Those questions aren’t a system. They’re 
 examples of reading the DOM to tell a story. It’s not systematic. 

You can see the large players wanting to push into the edge of the range but getting exhausted. That tells the story that’ll they’ll need to retrace and regroup. Now you see they keep retracing to a particular price in that range and holding it. Now let’s see if the other side can push through. No? Ok, I’m joining in. 

Spoofing is really important. I want to see what bids and offers kept lifted as they get threatened. I want to see when a big player is stacking the offer to drive you down into his bid only to remove his 2k on the offer and cause a 2 tick rally up. Let’s see if that can go through 4 ticks etc. 

It sounds to me like you’re using a poor DOM that doesn’t have the inside market orders as well. That’s crucial. 

Everyone in this subreddit is looking for an equation and that doesn’t exist in the DOM. The Dom is however used by just about every professional interviewed on chat with traders, so what does that tell you?

The only way to learn the DOM is to watch it and record it. It’s so hard to follow at first. You need to absorb it, make theories and see if they play out and why they didn’t. Absolutely talk to others about it, but you need time more than anything else. 

Lastly, if you want to learn the DOM. Learn it on something slow moving with a lot of liquidity first. It’s a lot harder reading ES and you can forget NQ,CL etc. 

I didn’t realise I wasn’t properly reading it till I traded the treasuries and had time for my brain to tell a story. The ES was just adrenaline filled gambling thinking I knew how to read it.

For example, rsi is saying over sold, price is heading down towards 200 ma, the last candle has formed a doji (which indicates possible trend reversal), and you notice there is increasing volume.

Shares is basically 50/50 probability of profit -> price goes up or down. Options you need to think about time, volatility and direction and acceleration

To trade options:

1) pick a ticker- pick a direction, up down sideways

2) use a 30-45 DTE

3) define strategy based on market conditions. debit spreads if you’re long vega (high IV), long gamma and short slightly short theta

credit spreads for the reverse of that

iron condors/straddles sideways or huge moves

4) set strikes by delta

5) and most importantly know how to defend/manage your trade

6) don’t do options until you practice paper trading

Also in your current intraday strategy you’re basically scalping gamma and would be the same as stock day trading if you’re not holding long enough. You’re also fighting against theta.

I came in cocky back in May because I had made some money in the market way back in the Dot Com boom. I knew I could play the opens and do multi-day swing trades because they worked beautifully for me during a bull market where you threw bait in a river with no line and someone walked back upstream with your fish and handed it to you.

This time around, I had some winning trades the first month and was quickly up $2k. A few months later and down $6k, I made a good decision and just watched. I had several bad habits to correct. Last week I began trading again and so far, I'm breaking even. I'm learning when to put on more risk because I see the market better now.

25 years ago, I changed careers from machinist to programmer. It required me to work 50 hours a week and study 20 hours a week to be successful. Day trading is more complicated than learning to write good code, and much more risky.

That said; I do love it! I haven't been this stimulated intellectually in a long time, and it feels good. 

The first unemployment payments from the Feds took a lot of the pressure off when I was laid off in March. If we get some more government cheese in January, I have confidence I can keep learning my craft at day trading and make this my only business going forward.

Who would tell anyone about their indicator or tool that they use that gives them golden eggs) or lack of capital (if you dont have enough money to lose in the early days before you learn) or lack of commitment (dunning kruger effect). Often all three of these are the reason. 

Why wouldnt the statistic be 95%? This is one of the hardest things to achieve in the world. Unlike other disciplines, this is also the most secretive and knowledge-hoarding discipline in the world. 96% of the information you find online will not help you.

t3_k3ipqr,ge3g3zc,"Personally when it comes to market conditions I try to answer these three questions: which way are we trending, which side is in control, and where are the larger levels of the side that is in control. To answer which way are we trending you need to look at the price structure are we producing higher highs/higher lows(bullish) or lower lows/lower highs(bearish). If we are producing a bullish price structure then longs are probably in control and I can look for the larger levels to trade off of to continue longs. I always want to trade the path that is most simple and has the least amount of traders against it. 

I primarily trade futures, so the vix futures (vx) help me see where buyers and sellers will enter the indices. I can then look at my larger levels in es,nq,ym (s&p, nasdaq, dow jones) and see when vx trades a short are the indices trading a long and vice versa. Most times from what I've found I'll draw my support/resistance in the indices and when vx trades its support I can then look to short indices and when vx trades its resistance I can then look to get long the indices. Keep in mind this is for day trading and primarily futures trading. If I'm looking for fade setups or reversals that is when I'll look at the $tick chart to see if we have made a high tick at highs(could be short reversal) in indices or low tick at lows in indices(could be long reversal).

Do not rely on them to teach you...you have to be willing to read and learn through absorbing information over weeks, months, etc.


1. Screen time - get lots of it! You need to be able to read charts, understand price action, and read level 2
2. Chat rooms - im not going to call them pumpers because I've come to greatly respect what some of them do. IMO you need to be in a discord group or multiple of them to witness how they call out stocks. I'd recommend checking out the following free rooms: buysellshort, sapphire, atlas, cam's room (twitter is stocksthatgo). Cam annoys me though - he never knows what the hell is going on. Go into the trading floor in each discord group - not the chat where amateurs are talking. My strongest personal recommendation if I can only choose one is Atlas. 
3. Use the discord groups to learn and use it to your advantage. Instead of copying all the plays in the discord, look at why they called them in the first place. The majority of the time they are not pumping but calling good setups.

You have to develop your own strategy and figure out what works, which way you like making money, how much you like making money, and baby whyyyy you want money what it’s going to be for and how you’ll make it worth the time and playing this game.  Watch charts, volume, price, find TA data that YOU like (I find RSI useful for example, some people don’t look at RSI 🤷‍♂️) Put money in, see what happens, figure out a new strategy if you need to, and repeat. make some fucking money. You can play it ultra safe at the beginning and never lose a cent - stop loss at entry (break even) point on every trade. You gotta lose money to really learn some of the lessons but just see the kind of gains you can get in what kind of time frame, not just jumping on everybody high momentum high vol asset, but watching stocks for weeks to see how those shares, options w/e move, and then making moves yourself with a safety lock and a price target to pull

1. Projecting your bad experience with a trading style onto the trading style as a whole - when there's easily accessible evidence to the contrary that it can be profitable - is, at best, unprofessional. Also keep in mind the messenger - someone selling FA trading strategies has a profit motive to create clickbait disparaging TA.
2. There are infinite ways to make money in the market. The best one is the one that aligns with your n=1. I happen to be profitable with TA, and I've known countless dozens of others who have as well during the course of my career. This includes everywhere from people supplementing their monthly income by a few hundred $ a month through 8 figure earners. 
3. The fact that some successful TA traders sell education products does not disqualify TA. Intelligent, successful people tend to have multiple streams of income. If you've learned a valuable skill that you can monetize, why wouldn't you? The fact that a large market exists for something (TA education) is more evidence that there is some ""there"" there than it being one giant scam.

With your statistics and track record, that should give you confidence in moving forward. A red day can shake anyone, but the key is to bounce back and keep on going. A tip for handling these red days if they are very detrimental to your psychology is that for the following week, size down completely. Go in with smaller positions and start building up your confidence again. You don't want an equity curve that is jumping around like someone on WSB, you want a clean staircase up. You'll get bumps here and there, but it's not going to end you. Another thing that may be contributing to these red days hurting your confidence could be due to the fact that this is going to be your primary source of income, a lot of pressure there.

I think you’re killing it bro. We’re in a very volatile environment that willl likely continue for a few years. To help add comfort, consider a strategy that does well in low volatility as well.

Even then a string could lose 20-25% 

Is that calculated in your strategy? Hyper scalping the common denominator is you. Keeping your sanity is the most important thing so maybe developing a system and awareness check ins for that as well. 

The doubt does go away. Often the reason it’s there in the first place is because we know we aren’t performing our best ability or following all our rules.

Granted, I personally trade options, so there's a lot more to it other than just things moving up or down (greeks are a real thing). If you strictly trade equities, it's just that. Have a plan when you enter a trade, and follow it to the T. There is no shame in exiting a trade for a loss as long as you follow your own rules. As a matter of fact, exiting a trade for a loss (early) is considered as a win in my book. It not only enhances and adds to your trading confidence, but it also allows you to focus on the next (trading) opportunity.

One thing people forget is, that it's not about making millions as a full-time day-trader. It's about allocating your time, now that you're doing this full-time from home, to arrive at your ""daily goal"". That means, to be patient, to wait for the right opportunity and to trade with proper actions. Money will follow if all that is done correctly. I have been trading while at work with so much distractions, it ain't fun having to cut an otherwise winning trade for pennies when it could have paid dollars if you know what I mean, but you gotta be able to trade in your own environment. If you only have 30 minutes set aside for your trades, then that's what you'll have to make work. If you are full-time, then you've got a whole lot more time on your hands.

t3_kl10rx,gh8uf6x,"Here’s one bit of info that immensely helped my trading, think outside the box, literally. What I mean is, don’t just think about your chart, level 2’s, indicators, price action etc. You need to listen to the market info and need to know the market psychology.
In terms of the market, you need to listen promptly to event news i.e. how is the general economic market doing? If there are more people losing jobs- expect a pull back, are there less cases of COVID-expect an uptrend, or maybe something to a company or sector, is Apple increasing production of product-expect an uptrend, is OPEC increasing oil production-expect the energy sector to uptrend.
In regards to market psychology, you need to understand where and why buyers will sell or buy. Did a stock gap up by 50% on previous day close, expect some type of pull back and profit taking, is the catalyst for the gap up strong for the company or the sector, expect sympathetic plays on other stocks.

I’m now profitable for around 6 consecutive months after blowing up a 7k account at the start of COVID. I’m not a big player by any means (Im averaging between 50-250 each day placing 3-5 trades per session (no trades in pre market/after hours or first 15 mins of the session, no trading between lunch hours, no stock that exceeds a 100% gain by the first half hour, no OTC and usually trade 5-100 dollar per share range).
