They result in high expenses year after year. So, many of the healthy will get cheaper premiums *because the sick will be so behind on their bills they won't be able to go to the doctor  or hospital until those past due bills are paid* - which they can't be because the amount will [exceed the poor's ability to pay](http://avalerehealth.net/news/analysis-despite-subsidies-chronically-ill-individuals-will-be-underinsured).

So they soon will fall deeply into debt, and then they wont be able to get care. \n\n*But the subsidies will keep being paid in their names, so the insurance will continue, their past due bill will keep going up as they try to catch up*. \n\nIF it was just *their* money they would simply lose that *\"coverage\".*\n\nHowever, it isn't, its the taxpayer's money. So instead they (and the taxpayer) will be on the hook for the ever growing remainder of the premium bill even for months where they were unable to go to the doctor because they were $20,000 in the hole. \n\n**Since the insurer is basically getting free money, that will lower the prices for rich people who can afford to pay the co-pays and deductibles.**\n\nAt least that is what I see happening. The wealthy, often self-employed people are influential - and they are the ones Obamacare was written to help.

Once they meet their maximum budget on entertainment, are they just supposed to ignore the other things they want to watch/listen to/play? \n\nI'm not directly supporting stealing copyrighted content, but I am saying that the big companies should be thankful that people even in these tougher times are still willing to keep their spending so high on entertainment.

You can't do that in a tight labor market. Secondly, it means that **they do not have to share their profits with their workers**.

If you own stock in a company, this should make you downright giddy!

This is done specifically to boost the stock market (also known as \"asset prices\").** The mechanism explaining how this works is complicated but in a nutshell, it can be explained like this: When the Fed prints money to buy Treasury Bonds, it buys those bonds from institutions like banks who currently own bonds. This has the effect of \"flushing\" cash in to the system. Banks typically put that cash to work in the stock market... secondly, it keeps interest rates low, making investments that pay interest less attractive...so, that causes money to flow to the stock market..\n\nSo, anyway.... in summary..

So here's my question: \n\nThe [CIA] (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2195.html#cu) claims that Cuba's GDP in 2012 was $72.3 billion,  ahead of the Dominican Republic's $59.27 billion.\n\nIs that accurate?

Where does the economic output comes from?  Does tourism and the limited reforms undertaken by Raul Castro explain this..?\n\nRegards,\n\nUlises\n\n", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1398116981.0, "tickers": [["CIA", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_24en6k", "title": "\"What You NEED to Know about the Wealth Inequality Debate\"", "text": "Diary of a Rogue Economist\nApril 30, 2014\nWhat You NEED to Know about the Wealth Inequality Debate \n\nby Bill Bonner, Chairman, Bonner & Partners\n\n Bill Bonner Gualfin, Argentina \n\nWednesday, 30 April 2014 \n\nDow up another 86 points. Can anything stop it? \n\nYes. We're just waiting to find out what. \n\nWe began this series with a question: Isn't it possible the same savants who now presume to address the problem of wealth inequality were those most responsible for causing it? \n\nThe question arose as we discussed a publishing sensation: Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. As you will recall, the book – all 700 pages – was recently number one on the Amazon.com bestseller list. \n\nWhoever heard of an economics tome that sold so well? The reason, we suspect, is that the book tells us something that a lot of people were waiting to hear. \n\nAdvertisement\nWho are the 30% Dividend Companies?\n\nWhy isn't anyone talking about THE most outrageous dividends in the public markets? Dividends so large and so safe you could, quite literally, live off of them. \n\nClick here for the full details.\n\nCriminals, Chiselers and Con Artists\n\nPiketty's gripe, as near as we can determine, is that the rich get richer – especially when economic growth rates are low. And that capitalism can lead to extreme wealth inequality. \n\nEconomic growth rates have been trending downwards for the last 40 years or so. And the average annual wage, adjusted for inflation, has stagnated. But Piketty claims the average annual rate of return on capital (from profits, rents, dividends, interest, royalties, etc.) has remained robust. As a result, private capital has grown as a percentage of national income. And, the rich have gotten richer. Of course, there are many reasons for this – some innocent, others corrupt. \n\nWe will not bother with the innocent ones. Criminals, chiselers and con artists are more revealing and entertaining. And just to make it more interesting, we will name names. In the 1970s – after President Nixon moved the world onto a purely fiat-based money system – the US economy was kissed by the magic of easy credit. \n\nPoof! \n\nIt was transformed from a handsome prince... into a toad. It used to be an economy where people earned money by making things for people who could afford to buy them. It became an economy of people who lent money to people so they could buy things they didn't need with money they didn't have. \n\nPiketty thinks he is criticizing capitalism. But after the 1970s, real capital played a smaller and smaller role. It was replaced by credit and its sinister twin: debt. \n\nThe r in Piketty's now famous annotation r > g (where r stands for the average annual rate of return on capital and g stands for the rate of economic growth) is supposed to represent the return on capital investment. \n\nBut where did the wad come from? \n\nSavings rates went down. Real earnings went down. Growth rates went down. So how could there be more capital available and how could it produce higher rates of return (compared to economic growth)? \n\nDistortions and Delusions\n\nThe whole thing is a headache for a thoughtful man. Capital investments with no real capital behind them. Profits that outstrip the economic growth from which they must come. \n\nWhat to make of it? \n\nWe don't dispute the basic fact: that the rich are getting richer. And that they are doing so by getting their hands on capital (something we believe is a damn good idea, especially for anyone hoping to build serious wealth). \n\nFor years, we've been complaining about the distortions caused by central banks. Rewarding the asset-owning classes (the rich) is just one of them. You could add: creating market bubbles, depressing middle-class incomes, increasing debt levels, misallocating resources to worthless, wealth-destroying activities, allowing government to avoid serious budget control, financing monster houses coast to coast... and our own personal favorite – putting dorky economists in positions of immense power and status. \n\nAnd now we even have dorky economists with No. 1 bestselling books. What next? \n\nRevolution! At least, that is what you might think if you listen to Piketty. He thinks r will continue to outpace g. And the natives will get restless. \n\nThe \"market economy, if left to itself, contains powerful forces of convergence in the distribution of wealth,\" he explains. But \"it also contains powerful forces of divergence, which are potentially threatening to democratic societies and to the values of social justice on which they are based.\" \n\nA State Based on Fraud\n\nOnce again, Piketty misunderstands the modern, democratic state. It is not based on real social justice. It is based on fraud. \n\nThe masses are told they control the government. And although the masses busy themselves with reading the newspapers, arguing about Obamacare and voting, the elites profit from bailouts, zero-interest-rate policies, subsidies, tariffs, sweetheart loans – you name it. \n\nThat is how the rich really got so rich... with the eager connivance of the authorities. \n\nAnd now Piketty concludes that the forces of \"divergence\" (of wealth) are likely to be much more powerful in the 21st century and that someone needs to do something about it. \n\nWho? The same authorities who distracted the public while the elites picked their pockets! \n\nUntil 1968, the Fed was required to maintain 25 cents worth of gold for every dollar in circulation. Then in 1968, under President Johnson, that requirement was scrapped. Thenceforth, there was no limit to the amount of cash and credit in the system. \n\nIn 1971, under President Nixon, the US reneged on its commitment to pay off foreign-held debt in gold. Now, there was no limit to the amount of debt Americans could run up abroad. Instead of paying their bills in gold, they could just pay in dollars, which are essentially more debt instruments (although with zero maturity). \n\nIn 1987... and again in 2000... Alan Greenspan showed that the Fed would not permit a serious correction. When a credit contraction threatened, the Fed came up with more credit on easier terms. \n\nBy 2007, under the leadership of Ben Bernanke, the Fed was fully committed to credit expansion forever. Milton Friedman had convinced Bernanke that the Great Depression was caused by a shrinking supply of money and credit. Bernanke saluted Friedman with: \"We won't do it again.\" Thanks to these numbskulls – and many others – real capital disappeared from the capitalist system. It was replaced by what Sisson called \"a fictitious money\" causing a \"monstrous aberration.\" \n\nThat is what we live with today. It was caused by the feds. They will continue making it worse... until the whole dreadful system blows up. \n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nBill\n\nEditor's Note: It's up to you to prepare, or not, for the coming bust. But we recommend you take advantage of the recent falls in the price of gold to add some \"insurance\" to your portfolio. That's why we've prepared a special report on gold. It includes full details of five ultra-cheap gold investments to make right now. \n\n\n\nMarket Insight:\nWere the Last 100 Years a \"Once Off\"? \n\nFrom the desk of Chris Hunter, Editor-in-Chief, Bonner & Partners\n\nPiketty's book has, you might say, \"hit a nerve.\" Especially his call for a global tax on capital.\n\nAn insight that has been garnering less attention: The last 100 years of economic history may have been a \"once off.\" \n\nPiketty argues that a succession of unique events – the Bolshevik Revolution, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II and the Cold War – destroyed a lot of capital in the 20th century. And that the post-World War II baby boom and the entry of women into the workforce (growth in the working population) plus big increases in productivity did a lot to boost real economic growth. \n\nAs a result, there weren't high levels of inequality between 1945 and the 1970s, when real economic growth started to fall again... and the Fed took over the task of creating \"demand\" by encouraging the Americans to take on more credit. \n\nThe White House, Congress, the Fed – and most investors – have a hard time coming to grips with this tectonic shift. Whisper it, but economic growth rates of 10%... 5%... even 3% may not be \"normal.\" \n\nTake a look at the chart below. It shows the real (inflation-adjusted) annual GDP growth rate in the US going back to 1935. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/Tys4Qu9\n\nSource: multpl.com\n\nAs you can see, America's real annual GDP growth has been slowly, but surely, \"tapering off\" from highs of 8+% in the 1960s to the sub-3% rate today. \n\nThe average real economic growth rate over the period was 4.4%. The US economy is currently growing at 43% below that level. And that's with the tailwind of the Fed's QE and ZIRP. \n\nLooking out ahead, you can forget the tailwinds of big growth in the labor force. And productivity growth over the last five years has been 42% lower than it was in the 1945-1973 period. \n\nBarring a big surge in productivity, something closer to 1% real annual US GDP growth over the next 20 years or so wouldn't be at all surprising. \n\nFood for thought for those \"too afraid\" to invest in steeply discounted stocks outside the US... \n", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "created_utc": 1398896632.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_26814r", "title": "\"I am trying to keep at the realities with you. Approximately total automation is coming. Men will be essential to the industrial equation but not as workers. People are going to be utterly essential as consumers‹what I call regenerative consumers, however, not just swill pails.\"", "text": "> Automation is with us. There is no question about it. Automation was inevitable to intellect. Intellect was found to diferentiate out experience continually and to articulate and develop new tools to do physically repeated tasks. Man is now no longer essential as a worker in the fabulously complex industrial equation. Marx’s worker is soon to become utterly obsolete. Automation is coming in Russia just as it is here. The word worker describing man as a muscle-and-reflex machine will not have its current 1961 meaning a decade hence. Therefore, if man is no longer essential as a worker we ask: \"How can he live? How does he acquire the money or credits with which to purchase what he needs or what he wants that is available beyond immediate needs?\" At the present time we are making all kinds of economic pretenses at covering up this overwhelming automation problem because we don’t realize adequately the larger significance of the truly fundamental change that is taking place in respect to man-in-universe. As automation advanced man began to create secondary or nonproductive jobs to make himself look busy so that he could rationalize a necessity for himself by virtue of which he could \"earn\" his living. Take all of our bankers, for example. They are all fixtures; these men don’t have anything to do that a counting machine couldn’t do; a punch button box would suffice. They have no basic banking authority whatsoever today. They do not loan you their own wealth. They loan you your own wealth. But man has a sense of vanity and has to invent these things that make him look important.\n\n> ....\n\n> The vast industrial complex undertakings and associated capital investments are today so enormous and take so long to inaugurate that they require concomitantly rapid regenerative economics to support them. The enterprise must pay off very rapidly in order to be able to refund itself and obtain the economic advantage to inaugurate solution of the next task with still higher technical advantage. In that regenerative cycle of events, the more consumers there are the more the costs are divided and the lower the individual prices. The higher the frequency of the consuming the more quickly the capital cost can be refunded, and the sooner the system is ready for the next wave of better technology. So man is essential to the industrial equation as a consumer‹as a regenerative consumer, a critical consumer, a man who tasting wants to taste better and who viewing realizes what he views can be accomplished more efficiently and more interestingly. The consumer thus becomes a highly critical regenerative function, requiring an educational system that fosters the consumer’s regenerative capacity and capability.\n\n> ....\n\n> Every time we educate a man, we as educators have a regenerative experience, and we ought to learn from that experience how to do it much better the next time. The more educated our population the more effective it becomes as an integral of regenerative consumer individuals. We are going to have to invest in our whole population to accelerate its consumer regeneration. We are going to be completely unemployed as muscle-working machines. We as economic society are going to have to pay our whole population to go to school and pay it to stay at school. That is, we are going to have to put our whole population into the educational process and get everybody realistically literate in many directions. Quite clearly, the new political word is going to be investment. It is not going to be dole, or socialism, or the idea of people hanging around in bread lines. The new popular regenerative investment idea is actually that of making people more familiar with the patterns of the universe, that is, with what man has learned about universe to date, and that of getting everybody inter-communicative at ever higher levels of literacy. People are then going to stay in the education process. They are going to populate ever increasing numbers of research laboratories and universities.\n\n> As we now disemploy men as muscle and reflex machines, the one area where employment is gaining abnormally fast is the research and development area. Research and development are a part of the educational process itself. We are going to have to invest in our people and make available to them participation in the great educational process of research and development in order to learn more. When we learn more, we are able to do more with our given opportunities. We can rate federally paid-for education as a high return, mutual benefit investment. When we plant a seed and give it the opportunity to grow its fruits pay us back many fold. Man is going to \"improve\" rapidly in the same way by new federally underwritten educational \"seeding\" by new tools and processes.\n\n> Our educational processes are in fact the upcoming major world industry. This is it; this is the essence of today’s educational facilities meeting. You are caught in that new educational upward draughting process. The cost of education will be funded regeneratively right out of earnings of the technology, the industrial equation, because we can only afford to reinvest continually in humanity’s ability to go back and turn out a better job. As a result of the new educational processes our consuming costs will be progressively lower as we also gain ever higher performance per units of invested resources, which means that our wealth actually will be increasing at all times rather than \"exhausted by spending.\" It is the \"capability\" wealth that really counts. It is very good that there is an international competitive system now operating, otherwise men would tend to stagnate, particularly in large group undertakings. They would otherwise be afraid to venture in this great intellectual integrity regeneration.\n\n> I would say, then? that you are faced with a future in which education is going to be number one amongst the great world industries, within which will flourish an educational machine technology that will provide tools such as the individually selected and articulated two-way TV and an intercontinentally net-worked, documentaries call-up system, operative over any home two-way TV set.\n\n> ....\n\n[Education Automation, Freeing the Scholar to Return to His Studies](http://web.archive.org/web/20020210193837/http://www.bfi.org/ea5.htm) By Buckminster Fuller\n\n    SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY PRESS, CARBONDALE AND\n    EDWARDSVILLE\n    FEFFER & SIMONS, INC., LONDON AND AMSTERDAM\n    Copyright 1962\n    ISBN 0-8093-0137-7\n    Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 62 - 17620", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "created_utc": 1400777676.0, "tickers": [["TV", 2]]}

What could and couldn't we all start making for ourselves?", "text": "So, I hope my question is clear from the title. But I'll try to elaborate a little more:\n\nDue to peak oil, the whole world will soon have to start using far less oil, which means shipping both intra- and internationally will have to decline in a major way for every country, though not at the same pace for every country. At any rate, soon every country will be forced to use far less oil in its economy. Somehow or another, some catastrophe or shortage or shock is going to help humanity figure this out--that the economy depended on cheap oil and the oil just isn't flowing up as much as it used to but we're on track to need even more if we're gonna give the babies that are being born the sort of lives we've been living, on a material and consumer basis. That we're not \"almost out of it\" but we're moving swiftly and steadily in that direction. Plus we're using up all sorts of other really bad stuff to use up, like arable land, and water in aquifers, fish populations, and we're peaking in many other resources (like phosphorous) that are critical in our economy. And if that weren't enough, if we don't stop producing so much carbon dioxide, that's going to kill us, too. So for many reasons, we're all going to have to start using a lot less of all sorts of resources--and then less and less and less until somehow we're a completely sustainable economy. I like to think we can try to make it work and keep civilization from falling apart. Anyway.\n\nSpecialization will have to come down and regional/local manufacture of almost everything is going to have to come up. Right? \n\nBut anyway, some things we'll still have to ship from afar, and we can conserve our fuel for these things. I hear there are some metals and minerals that are chiefly produced only in a few places, so I feel like that stuff would still have to be shipped and traded if all the regions were to maintain some kind of high-tech industry.\n\nSo, even Cuba consumes a pretty large amount of oil. They're gonna feel a pinch in that regard from peak oil too, won't they?\n\nAnyway, I don't know how clear that is, but that's the general sort of thing I'm interested in. I don't really know much about which statistics I would look at and where I would look them up to try to figure the answer to this question out on a concrete material basis--and you know I mean how much of everything--in terms of like, bikes, computers, airplanes, internet infrastructure, agriculture equipment and inputs, monitors, fire alarms, wind turbines and other products and materials important in building sustainable electricity generation and delivery systems, etc. etc. What goods are we just not all going to be able to make? What goods will disappear because we just can't make them anymore?\n\nI have lots of curiosities about how we'll have to adapt our economy but I'm not sure I know how to go about formulating the right question to learn more about it, so I hope you will excuse this meandering question.\n\nAnybody know about this sort of thing?", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1402633306.0, "tickers": []}

The basis for using this ratio is to see that companies are not valued more than the GDP itself. The valuation of all companies in an economy should not exceed the total GDP of the economy thus a market cap to GDP ratio of more than 1 would signal a red flag.\n\n[Here is the link for Buffet ratio](http://www.vectorgrader.com/indicators/market-cap-gdp)\n\nTake a look at the points when it went beyond 1. Both of those periods were bubbles (2000 and 2008). So the present ratio of 1.27 is clearly in the red region.\n\n2) The Shiller PE ratio for S&P 500 (CAPE)(P/E 10): It is a valuation measure, generally applied to broad equity indices (in this case S&P 500), that uses real per-share earnings over a 10-year period. It uses smoothed real earnings to eliminate the fluctuations in net income caused by variations in profit margins over a typical business cycle.\nLooking at the last twenty years the only 2 peaks above the present CAPE ratios are both bubbles. Again an indicator that present valuations are unrealistic.\n\n[Here is the link for Shiller PE ratio](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/)\n\n3) NYSE margin debt: Margin debt levels, and their rate of change, are sometimes used as an indicator of investor sentiment because margin debt rises when investors feel good about the prospects in the stock markets. In the past, margin debt levels have peaked at the same time market indexes reached relative peaks. When markets decline in a hurry, a large number of margin calls will usually come due, which can add to already heightened selling pressure.\n\n[Here is an article on NYSE margin debt](http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/NYSE-Margin-Debt-and-the-SPX.php)\n\nLets discuss the above points first.

The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become 'profiteers,' who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat.

Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.

{"name": "t3_2b50sh", "title": "Economic theory of food stamp programs", "text": "I've always been frustrated that there is no public information on how food stamp dollars are spent. Food stamps are somewhat unique, especially these days with EBT cards. With welfare programs, you get a check and have discretion over what you want to purchase. With Food Stamps (now SNAP), you get a card pre-loaded with money that can only be used to purchase foods from an approved retail store selling food. \n\n**What interests me is this: how do you think SNAP money is spent??** There are anecdotes of people on SNAP spending that money on chips, cookies, and soft drinks, but there is so much food available and no one knows what percentage of money is spent on what. Economic theory would support the argument that we make different decisions based on our situation, but when we get bonuses (or additional tax rebates), most people don't go out and spend those right away. With the Bush tax break, spending was not spurned and was a great example of how people took the unexpected money and put it to use in bettering their financial situation (paying down debts, investing it, etc.), not on buying a new TV.\n\nEBT benefits are different - we all need food, and you can get by on almost anything. Your healthiness will be different if you are eating cookies and chips everyday instead of vegetables and chicken, but you can still live. These benefits also aren't unexpected - they come in monthly.\n\n**Would consumers on these programs be theoretically inclined to spend their benefits in ways that are more immediately gratifying? People will act in more risky ways with money that isn't theirs, so is it fair to say that consumer on these programs will spend money in more personally satisfying ways when using money given to them by the government?** \n\n*I personally believe that people on these programs spend money differently and are not well educated in nutrition, so this spending can lead to adverse health affects that, for those on medicare and SNAP, would mean the public is paying the costs of food and health care, and the person is paying the cost of having poor health. It seems requiring nutrition education, or a food benefits program that provides set food items instead of consumer discretion, would be more publicly beneficial and better for the individual on SNAP.*", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "created_utc": 1405785906.0, "tickers": [["SNAP", 2]]}

It was explained as a surrogate for a substitution measure.\n\n\n-BLS introduced: More frequent re-weightings of the CPI index from every ten years to every two years, which moved the CPI closer to a substitution-based index, but the change was not considered a change in methodology.\n\n\n-BLS introduced: Ongoing re-weightings of sales outlets (discount/mass-merchandisers v ersus Main Street shops), also moving closer to a substitution-based index and creating other constant-standard-of-living issues.\n\n\n**Out-of-Pocket Expenses versus Nebulous Quality (Hedonic) Adjustments**\n\n\nThe BLS expanded quality adjustments to include the concept of “hedonic” quality adjustments, altering the pricing of goods and services for nebulous quality changes that often were not viewed or recognized by consumers as desired improvements.\n\n\nWhere the effect here on the pricing of goods and services could not be quantified directly from a pricing standpoint, the pricing impact was estimated by computer statistical modeling—hedonic adjustment modeling—that had little if any relevance to real-world experience.\n\n\nWhere the quality of the product was deemed by the government to have improved (the usual circumstance), prices in the CPI calculations were adjusted lower to offset the higher quality.\n\n\n-Usually, though, the purchasing consumer only had the option of paying out-of-pocket the full price for the product, again with little or no concept of the quality improvement being acquired and/or having no chance to opt out of paying for the improvements.\n\n**Examples**\n\nIn an early example, the government mandated the use of a gasoline formulation that purportedly would improve auto emissions. That added ten cents per gallon to gasoline costs, but that cost was excluded from CPI calculations. The person filling his or her gas tank, however, suffered the actual out-of-pocket expense. The government later abandoned excluding government-mandated “quality” improvements, such as gasoline additives, from inflation calculations, but the principles here were exactly the same for industry-generated “quality” improvements that were not optional to consumers.\n\n\nText books, for example were modeled, where one pricing factor in the hedonic quality model was whether or not there were color pictures in a book. Unless the student was an art student, the concern usually was not over colored pictures, but rather along the lines of “What is my out-of-pocket cost for textbooks this semester? New computer features usually were deemed quality improvements, with downside price adjustments made in the CPI for the changes, even though a consumer may not have wanted or used the features.\n\n\n*The consumer still had to buy those features and pay full cost out-of-pocket, irrespective of what the government determined those products were generating in purported hedonic quality benefits that the consumer was not considering or using.*\n\n\nSignificant feature changes should be treated as a new product introduction, or otherwise ignored. If the use of the hedonic process were legitimate here, it would be applied to all goods and services, but a CPI, so based, soon would become meaningless to the public (as already has happened with the CPI-U).\n\n\n*For example, there has been no pricing adjustment (upside in this case) to the costs of air travel for the destruction of travel convenience with the advent of the TSA, or from the downward spiral in U.S. air traveler comfort and convenience resulting from the effects of mergers and acquisitions, and from increasing flight delays due to economizing on aircraft maintenance.*\n\n\n*Consumer concerns are for his or her out-of-pocket expenses. What am I paying for my textbooks this semester; what am I paying out-of-pocket to fly from New York to Chicago; or what am I paying out-of-pocket for a computer, even if I am looking just to use limited functions but have no choice but to buy unwanted features?*\n\n from shadowstats.com/article/no-438-public-comment-on-inflation-measurement", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "created_utc": 1406375392.0, "tickers": []}

Also, I think that the US system may be shooting itself in the foot with this (I do understand, of course, that the US system is not a unified voice and the decisions made by the judicial system say little to nothing about the current administration's position on the issue, I clarify this because as I'm not a US national I may well now know this).\n\nA summary of the situation from Wiki before I go further, you can check sources there.\n\nHoldouts retained a total of USD4 billion in bonds as of 2013.[10] Vulture funds, which owned USD1.3 billion of this total,[5] sued to be repaid at 100% of face value for bonds purchased not from Argentina but on the secondary market for cents on the dollar after the 2002 default,[11] filing injunctions to attach future payments to other bondholders by way of forcing Argentina to settle.[2][12][13][14][15] Vulture funds, moreover, own a large quantity of credit default swaps (CDS) against Argentine bonds, creating a further incentive to not only trigger a default against Argentina; but also to undermine the value of the bonds themselves, as the CDS would pay out at a higher rate if the defaulted bonds decline to extremely low values.[11] Meeting vulture funds' full face-value demands is problematic for Argentina, because although bonds held by vulture funds are a small share of the total (1.6%), such a settlement would lead to lawsuits from other bondholders demanding to be paid on similar terms and thereby create a liability of USD15 to USD20 billion.[16]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring\n\n***\n\nWhy I side with my country:\n\n- We have maintained, to enormous strain to our economy, debt obligations. We have, as a society, diverted an enormous amount of resources to actually pay up our debts to the best of our possibilities.\n\n- We have done this in reasonable terms under all possible common sense conceptions: we have paid the IMF and have agreed with the enormous majority of our debt-holders.\n\n- The litigious group is an openly speculative fund that is not the original debtholder. I understand this is legitimate under the law, of course, but this is clearly an exploit that needs to be addressed in my opinion.\n\nWhy I think this is important:\n\n- Argentines are not pioneers of many things, but we are pioneers of debt crises. We've been having them since the middle of the 20th century, and the 2001 one was basically a \"petri-dish\" case of much of what came afterwards. \n\n- This sets the tone not only for further litigations against emerging countries, which would be very very dangerous to the world because I think that at this point emerging economies are a big driver of world economy, correct me if I'm wrong, but also for the future of the national debt market. Will emerging countries look to place debt under US Law with this precedent? I wouldn't think so, and this could be the start of a shift in a market that, in my opinion, has been a big part of US economy for some time now.\n\nI can totally see how my views could be biased not only because of me being from Argentina but also because of some ignorance on my part as I'm not an expert by any means.

Until they are removed, all keys can be used to redeem a free chest of your choice. \n\nI know almost nothing about economics and I am very curious as to how this will affect the price of keys (I have a ton) in the upcoming months.

I've run across several articles that state that price discrimination is economically-efficient.  That seems plausible to me.\n\nThere would need to be restrictions to prevent suppliers of goods from colluding in setting prices; that is, each would need to come up with its own prices to discriminate upon.  Having global price floors set across suppliers for a market would permit price discrimination being used to establish monopoly prices, as [happens](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20019/1/sp04ke05.pdf) with California raisin prices.  However, I can envision a world where price discrimination is performed on a per-supplier basis.\n\nCollege financial aid is currently the area that I can think of where price discrimination is most-widely used.  Here, a college sets its price as a maximum of what it might charge, then selectively provides discounts from that price, such that each individual person paying as much as they can bear, and letting the supplier get access to information about the consumer's assets.  I'm not sure whether this mechanism works well or not, but within this field, certainly price discrimination is very common.\n\nHowever, if price discrimination *is* economically-efficient, why do policies not seem to globally-encourage it?  If it is not economically-efficient, why do policies not seem to globally-discourage it?\n\nThe dispute over [imported prescription drugs](http://www.forbes.com/sites/edsilverman/2013/12/31/will-americans-be-allowed-to-import-prescription-drugs/) seems to show a shift towards banning price discrimination in that field.

I’m a very rusty economics grad, so please be gentle and ELI5…\n\nA bit of background: I studied economics at uni and am now working for a wealth management firm as a trainee investment manager. I’m based in the UK and so have been studying towards qualifications that will let me manage investment portfolios on a discretionary basis. During these studies they repeatedly use the quantity theory of money equation (MV = PT) as a point of reference for economic policy. \n\nMy understanding of the quantity theory of money equation is that part of it relies on the assumption that money is an exogenous factor to aggregate demand and therefore can be used as a tool to manipulate demand and control inflation etc. In other words, quantitative easing policies are designed to increase the money supply, reduce interest rates and cause inflation through increased demand.  \n\nIn my final year at uni we learnt the Neo-Keynesian 3 equation model (IS-PC-MR) where they pretty much told us everything we’d learnt in the first two years was bullshit and that the money supply and demand for money is endogenous and actually a product of aggregate demand. Hence the interest rate is the way you control demand and not through the quantity of money. \n\nAs you can probably tell by my mixing of theories and general confusion, I didn’t do very well in these lectures, which is probably why I find myself at this point. \n\nIf my understanding of the IS-PC-MR is correct, QE does work to create low interest rates but cannot create inflation. This seems to be reflected in the UK data where banks sit on massive quantities of cash because no one wants to take out a loan and the inflation figures are, let’s say, sub optimal. \n\nWhy then do we continue to use it as a stimulus? There are rumours of European QE where interest rates are already ridiculous and the money is going to do nothing else but sit in banks across Europe? What am I missing?\n\nTL;DR What’s the point of QE? \n\nEdit: I may have gotten there with a bit of prompting. Rewind to 2008 and the world is in melt down.

{"name": "t3_2ix6m1", "title": "My treatise on money, debt, government and wealth from 5000 years ago to the present (Final part)", "text": "You must remember that money is an output of what we do and how we think, it's just the end, external result of our activities. So when people talk about giving people money or bailing out the people, that simply doesn't make sense. If nothing else in the economy changes, just giving the people (private sector) money won't change anything. The money is the output, just the result. You can't feed that into the private (producing) sector. \n\n\nSo finally, you can get a better understanding of what has happened since 2008. The QE for the most part just refilled lost liquidity. There was virtually no inflation because they didn't add too much to the total amount that the private sector was using. That's what central banks around the world have been doing. Refilling liquidity that was lost when mortgages went bad. But if velocity of money isn't picking up, that's another issue entirely. That's got to do with the behaviour of the people. Not with the money itself. What's the trickle-down effect the Fed is talking about? It's giving money to the financial sector and then hoping they spend it into the economy. The value of the money is in the decisions people make with it,  and so forcing people to spend the money will lessen its value. So all the Fed or any central bank can do is give out money and then hope people spend it wisely (whatever that means in a given region or nation). The problem now is that we seem to have this overwhelming optimism in what central banks can do. If there's a structural problem, money will do nothing in that situation. If the King gives his soldiers coins, but only a small portion of them spend them, then the problem is not the coins. It won't matter what the King gives his soldiers as payment or what promises he makes. He has to use non-monetary means to get the other soldiers to spend their money. So he has to make structural changes. There could be dissatisfaction amongst the soldiers. There could be a problem with production amongst the producing sector. Either way, the fact that the money isn't being spent is just a symptom of something else going on. So in that case, adding more money to the economy won't change anything. \n\n\n**A few things to consider:**\n\nA Government can never run out of money that is has sovereign control over\n\nIt can always print the money it needs\n\nIt does not need a source of revenue\n\nTaxes are not a source of revenue for the government\n\nTax is a political decision\n\n\n--But\n\n\nWhy do tax collection agencies go to extreme lengths to collect taxes?\n\nMoney has value (or at least part of it) because people pay taxes\n\nThe work the private sector does gives value to money\n\n\n--Also\n\n\nProduction drives growth\n\nWithout production, there is nothing to buy\n\n\n--But\n\n\nConsumer spending accounts for 70% of GDP\n\nThis is how we trade and interact with one another\n\n\n**Final points**\n\nThere is nothing inherent in any object we have ever used as money. It's all psychological. Even gold and silver have no inherent qualities. They contain some qualities, and it's our psychological makeup and how we've progressed as a species that sees value in those qualities. Outside of the way we are as people, gold and silver do not matter. Money just has to be an external representation of what's going in our heads. We humans have a propensity to lie, cheat, deceive or simply not tell the truth. It's very hard to tell if someone is being genuine. Yet in this world, we must deal with one another. So money provides external proof of at least some aspect of our dealings with one other.  \n\n**Money has 3 roles**\n\n-External Representation of what's going on in our heads\n-Allows us to live with strangers and be anonymous in large cities\n-Allows us to get rich (with the help of a governing power) \n", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "created_utc": 1413001741.0, "tickers": []}
{"name": "t3_2ix6g2", "title": "My treatise on money, debt, government and wealth from 5000 years ago to the present (part 2)", "text": "**The Government, money and price**\n\nThe private sector produces goods and services that it uses amongst itself. Money that is used exclusively by the private sector would net out to 0, as one person would spend, another would save. You could have a rich person for a while, but he would have most of the money in the society and eventually would need to spend on what he needs anyway. But all transactions net out to 0. But using technology, the private sector produces a surplus. Where should that surplus go? The Government now steps in. The Government consumes some of that surplus. All it has done is give out money, it's not really 'spending' as it never had resources in the first place. It's just giving the private sector money for use of some of that surplus. But there is surplus leftover after the government has taken its share. And this is what the private sector and Government now competes for. And this final surplus, is what enables people to get sustainably wealthy. So the Government has given out money to the private sector for the initial surplus that was created. It (or more accurately, the Central Bank) now has to 'price' the final surplus. You have to ensure the private sector has enough money to buy the surplus, otherwise the Government can have money printed and simply buy the final surplus. It would outbid the private sector in this scenario. This would be tantamount to confiscation, since it's not allowing the people who produce to have access to the surplus. It also removes incentives for people to work harder to get access to more money to then get a larger share of the surplus. The Government creates enough money to properly price the surplus goods and services so that you don't have deflation or too much inflation. And this is where you have to be careful that the rich don't consume too much of the surplus pie from the poor. And you want these prices to be relatively stable, so that people can make projections, people can start businesses and so on. Now this is simplified of course, but it's a broad overview of what happens.\n\n\n\n**The army and religion**\n\nReligions and the army were the first exterior, non-productive sectors that received money first and spent it into a society. Government takes that role now. It was just a way to organise the first societies. An exaggerated example given in Debt: The First 5000 years is as follows: A King has a large army that he wants to maintain. But supplying it is difficult, expensive and time consuming. Not to mention the logistics. So what he does is hands out a bunch of coins to his soldiers, demands some of them back as taxes, and boom, you have an economy. The soldiers want to spend these coins they've been given, and people need to have them to pay tax. So the economy becomes organised as people want to provide goods and services to the soldiers, and from the outside, this would look like a 'natural market'. Why does the army get the money first in this instance? It provides an intangible service: safety in an uncertain world. Religion is very similar in this regard, as it provides salvation and reassurance in an uncertain world. \n\n\n**Government debt**\n\nIs simply the surplus the private sector has to play with. The debt isn't something to be 'paid off'. Moreover, the government debt (a number) is not tied to resources; so that all this talk of future generations working off government debt is nonsense. It is not that way and it cannot be that way. It would be undesirable to 'pay off' the government's debt, as this would destroy a lot of money in the private sector. In this instance, the Government debt just has a PR problem.\n\n\n**Wealth**\n\nIt's easy to think of wealth as simply a high number in someone's bank account. So for example, you might imagine that a wealthy person just has a really high number in their bank account. You might have 700 dollars, and then you think the rich person has 1 million dollars in their bank account. But that's simply not the case. A lot of their money is in bonds, stocks, other assets and so on. The wealth is just the accumulated value of these investments. But it's not just a high number in the bank account. What difference does it make? Not just in terms of higher interest rates, but that the rich have a vested interest in keeping the economy going, and a slight downturn in those investments can mean a large loss in wealth. And so the wealth is partly contingent on time. This is where discussion on the minimum wage comes in. People often use Wal-Mart as an example. For the last financial year, the profits were 128 billion. It's easy to look at that figure and say that a few hundred million could be garnished off the top and be paid to the workers in the form of a higher minimum wage. But think about this as a micro-economy. Adding more money into the system without any structural changes won't achieve too much. But besides, it's easy to say that the profit can be taken from a bank account that holds the profits of the company. But the heirs wouldn't just have the profits in a large bank account. They invest it. So when you ask for more money from them, it could mean the rich heirs need to pull money out of other investments to then pay their workers more. This is important. It's not a matter of just pulling out money from a bank account where the money is 'stagnating'. Those heirs are investing it, and they may need to sell stocks, bonds, assets and so on to pay these workers extra. Which will then have knock-on effects in the economy. So you're not really looking for a higher minimum wage as you are structural changes that will allow you to live better on the wage you're getting paid or some other changes. So think of wealth as a floating amoeba, that receives constant inputs to keep it afloat. Of course there are outputs, and so the amoeba just floats in a particular spot, given its inputs and outputs. Inputs could be stocks going up, bonds, assets going up in price (but not necessarily value), and other similar windfalls. The person has their own expenses, and this keeps the amoeba floating in a particular spot. The important thing is that wealth has constant inputs; it's not about working for a bit, getting a large amount of money, becoming wealthy, and then just having a 1,000,000 in the bank account and sitting back and relaxing. That's not wealth. Imagine how many people would do this. It could well be a disaster for the economy. This is why the wealthy work so hard. This is why we hear about wealthy people working really hard, and sometimes it's easy to think 'why doesn't that person just slow down?' But this about the effect our system has on people. It's a really good thing that you can't just work for a bit, and sit back and enjoy the money. We require people to keep working! Even the wealthiest amongst us.\n\n\n**Financial system and the bailouts**\n\nA lot of people were and still are upset about how the financial industry got bailed during the crisis. But this makes perfect sense. The financial sector is where religion and the military used to stand. Both were non-producing sectors, and both spent money into the economy and helped to create and perpetuate markets. So the King would give money to the religious leaders or to the Armies who would then spend the money into the economy, and that money is given value because people worked to get it. The money spent into the economy is given value by the work done by the private sector. So if there's a problem, does it make sense for the King to give the people money directly? Of course not. He gives it either to the military or the religious leaders, and they spend more money into the economy. If he gave the people money directly, and nothing else changed (prices and so on), the people might work less now since they can more easily pay their taxes and have more money left over. You have more money, why work as hard? But everyone would think the same thing, and eventually you get into a spiral, as fewer goods and services are available and so on.\n", "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "created_utc": 1413001602.0, "tickers": []}
{"name": "t3_2ix5vv", "title": "My treatise on money, debt, government and wealth from 5000 years ago to the present (Part 1)", "text": "Am I just paraphrasing a lot of the work from Debt: The First 5000 years? Why yes I am. But I am adding  important information and simplifying the narrative for anyone to understand because it's a dense book. Basically I want to help explain the behaviour of central banks around the world since the 2008 financial crisis. All the stimulus programs happening around the world basically. Finally, I want to help you understand wealth and the minimum wage.  \n\n\n\n**In the beginning**\n\nThe basic method humans used to interact with one another before the widespread use of money was social credit. This is best understood when you're out with your  friends and you purchase something for one of them because they can't afford it right now. Do you set terms and conditions on the repayment like a bank does? Of course not, neither would you charge interest. In fact, you might not even care that much when it's paid back, since you're certain they will do at some point. Moreover, it may be the situation that you bought something for your friend for $10, but you don't expect them to pay you back exactly $10 or something else of the same value. You may accept that same friend just buying lunch or two small lunches and call the debt paid. If you can't imagine doing this with a person, then that person most likely is not your good friend. It really has to be someone you can trust.\n\n\n\nAnd before the advent of coinage, which is as much a social revolution as a technological one, we lived in small villages and towns. In these circumstances, most people would have known each other, and trusted one another enough to use social credit/debt with one another. You might know the same 50 people your whole life, and this can be seen as basically an extended group of friends. You didn't need physical tokens in such an atmosphere, as everything was basically stored as a virtual 'ledger' that everyone held in their heads that was essentially a snapshot of the economy in that town/village. The economy existed in our heads. This by the way, is how we can think of Central Banks today; they are the virtual ledger for our entire economy, it's just an external representation (external to our minds) of our economy. Seeing it like this, we can see that the invention of Central Banks really isn't that revolutionary. What's important to note about this economy is that there are discrete transactions as all the interactions were simply in a flowing state, where you owed something to one person but someone could owe you something else. And the 'value' of items was particular to the people involved, their history, personality and so on. It was normal for people to be creditors and debtors to one another at the same time and there was no such thing as 'paying off your debts'. In fact, if you looked to 'pay off your debt' to someone, that would in fact mean you wanted nothing further to do with that person.\n\n\n\n**Coinage**\n\nThis is now where bullion steps in. If you're dealing with strangers, you wouldn't use such a system since you can't vouch for the people you're dealing with. In these instances, you use coins or tokens, and those interactions with the strangers then  become a single transaction, that's settled in a single trading session. That made sense, you might never deal with those people again. But what happened as we started in live in larger settlements and where it was impossible to vouch for everyone was that we needed to use coins or tokens on a daily basis, not just with a passing stranger or similar situation. Without coins, it would have been almost impossible to live in such large centres as a cohesive group. This is where coins and the 'market' is born. With strangers we don't have time to establish a dynamic or any history with each other, and that's where now a combination of the law, bullion and 'markets' means we're all equals when it comes to transactions. Your $10 is the same as my $10, and so on. Now every interaction is a transaction and we use coins/tokens with one another. Throughout history, this just happened to be gold/silver. It's important to understand that the 'market' is not a natural state of human affairs. It's an institution we have placed over each other so that we can live in large numbers together. \n\n\nBut of course given the level of technology we had (and diminishing returns), we only had so much food production and therefore the world population was relatively stable for a long time. In this situation, gold and silver are fine to use as money since population growth was quite stable or grew at a slow rate and so it was easy to provide all the gold/silver people needed to deal with one another. From Debt: The First 5000 Years, the author points out that in many occasions during the middle ages (before 1450 AD) there were shortages of coins and people simply reverted back to either using local currencies with limited circulation or just social credit/debt arrangements. This simply is not feasible anymore, we must have money to trade with one another.\n\n\n\n**The government, surplus**\n\nThis is now where we encounter the Government. It is important in human affairs that a Government does not produce anything. It simply governs. This has two aspects to it: firstly, a policy-setter that also produced something could set policies that favoured himself; and we instinctively feel that a policy-setter who produced half the time would not be good at the former job. We recognise that we live better when we're together, but for that to work, we need a governing power in place. A governing power provides a high-level view of a region, one that it can do because the people in power are not producing anything. The governing power consumes the surplus of the private sector and in exchange, it provides security and services to society. By consuming a surplus that it did not produce, the Government gives out money, and this gives people the prospect of becoming wealthy. It also creates more extreme inequality. This is simply a by-product of having a governing power and money in play. \n\n\n\n**The 'market'**\n\nThere is a lot of talk about leaving the market alone, how much Government's should be involved and so on. This is a false dichotomy. There is no market without Government. It's simple as that. People always assume that the market is how people interact naturally. This is false. It's a manmade institution, that can only exist with the law, with enforcement and vigilance. \n\n\n\n**Bullion/Central Banks**\n\nI think it's a false dichotomy to talk about Governments printing money and an economy relying on gold, which cannot be printed but must be dug up out of the ground. But of course it can be debased, as has happened many times during history. Bullion and central banks share one aspect in common: they are not controlled by the Government. The entire point of a central bank is that it is free from the Government, and so monetary policy is separate from politics. And it's worked. Bullion works in an environment where population is relatively stable, but with a growing population, you need someone to be in control of the money supply. You cannot have a shrinking money supply but also a growing population, as that would mean there are fewer tokens for strangers to exchange with each other. If strangers can't use money to interact with one another, they will use other means, and most are violent. It is a feature of post-apocalypse shows/games that money isn't in use, and everyone now is a stranger to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. But this is time consuming, so we often have shortcuts to deal with each other, and again, these are often violent. Right now, we may have such shortcuts in mind when dealing with a stranger, but we have money instead that we use to deal with that stranger. \n", "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "created_utc": 1413001155.0, "tickers": []}

With magic, a person is able to create something out of thin air with the power of thought and some other tools such as wands or cauldrons. This would mean that magic is a renewable source and only requires time and food to be replenished before it can be used again. Considering this detail, would it make sense for things made from magic to be free to the public or incredibly cheap? Or should there be a cost on magic-related things to compensate for the food that is needed to replenish a magic-user's body? What if the food that was made to replenish magical energy was made with a magical spell?\n\nThis scenario is a tad ridiculous but I would like your input on how an economy that is partly based on money and partly based on magic would work. This made me curious especially since I've been hearing about how cheap solar energy (a source that won't run out for at least 5 billion years) is becoming.", "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1412997182.0, "tickers": []}

How are the policies of the Fed any different than a driven harmonic oscillator?", "text": "In intro physics in college, we learned about \"harmonic oscillators\". \n\nA standard harmonic oscillator looks like a sine wave. It would be an Austrian economist's view of economic cycles. \n\nOne kind is called a \"damped harmonic oscillator\". It's when a pendulum swings and gradually runs out of energy. This is what a Keynesian sees as economic cycles, and why they feel that stimulus is necessary, to fight the forces of deflation.\n\nAnother kind is called a \"driven harmonic oscillator\". This is like when you jump on a trampoline and time your jump to match the upswing of the trampoline surface. One feature of this is that it keeps magnifying the oscillation until it hits some final quantity (your legs are only so powerful or the trampoline breaks). A graph looks [like this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/oscdr2.html#c3).\n\nBased on the way that the Fed responds to financial crises, I can't see how they're any different than a driven harmonic oscillator working with the resonant frequency of our economic cycles. They are designed to start pumping on the downswing and stop pumping when \"momentum\" is gained, and the amount increases proportionally to the downswing. \n\nIf you look at charts of stimulus vs. total increase in money supply/equities prices, it looks exactly like a harmonic oscillator in a physics experiment.

{"name": "t3_2jrk0n", "title": "A useful way to think about what \"cheap\" and \"expensive\" really means in a society", "text": "So it's easy to get confused by what those terms really mean. I will give clarification as I understand it. It's important to note that if something is expensive, it's not because a lot of money was spent on it. The money is a symptom of something else that's going on. The money is merely the result of activity that is going on, not the cause. It's merely showing what's happening.\n\nWhat do I mean. Imagine two separate groups of 10 people. In one group, people generally trust each other. In the other, people are more mistrustful. This is regardless of what is used as money. Let's say you want to organize a business meeting between two members in each group of people. In the group where everyone generally trusts each other, it will be quite easy to organise the meeting. But not only that, the parties involved won't demand much payment, since they can trust that the other person won't try to cheat or harm them. And so if we consider a resource pool between the 10 people, those two people won't demand much of those resources in order to meet. It's 'cheap'.\n\nBut what about the second group? Well, if people are mistrustful, they would be hesitant to meet, even if it could be a good opportunity. Each party might feel that the other will harm them or try to cheat them, so they will be on their guard. But in order to facilitate this meeting, it will be 'expensive'. If each party is to show up to the meeting, they will demand a larger share of resources for their participation, because they want compensation in advance. Those people want to have more resources compared to the others in their group since they're taking a risk meeting someone else.\n\nSo it's not the money that's being spent that decides if something is cheap. This is happening after the fact, as you can see in the simplified examples. You will find that richer countries tend to have the most trusting citizens. It's easy to say that bring rich makes you more trusting; but it's actually the reverse. It's being trusting that will generally make you richer as a society.\n\n", "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1413788871.0, "tickers": []}

How was this possible?**\n_____________________\nas alway interest rates are very important:\n\n-The 10 year gov interest rate throughout the 1940s and 1950s stayed at under 3% until 1958\n\n-Throughout the 1960s it gradually wnet from 3% to 6%\n\n-Throughout th 1970s it gradually wnet from 6% to 12%\n\n-1980-1984 saw interest rates stay in the 11-15% range\n\n_______________________\n\nat this point i'm assuming you know how the fed/treasury create money...if not see linked comment below for my 1 page quick description:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/2obgam/my_analysis_how_the_fed_unwound_its_balance_sheet/cmlitwf\n\n__________________\n\nSo, if you want to decrease the Fed's balance sheet, you must decrease the supply of money in the system\n\nHow does this work? Treasury must issue new t-Bills to pay back principal on old t-bills to the Fed...These new t-bills (issued gradually from 1950-1984 or so) are paid for by general public with fed Notes...this reduces fed notes/money supply in circulation. So public gives fed notes to Treasury in exchange for new t-bills.  Treasury gives these just received fed notes back to Federal Reserve as principal payment for old t-bills issued in/around 1945). This reduces the Fed's balance sheet as the Federal Reserve gets more and more fed notes back from the Treasury (who in turn got those same fed notes from the general public in exchange for new bills).  Overall money supply decreases in proportion to amt that the Treasury has to pay back to the Fed. Is this what happened from 1945-1984? and is it reasonable to expect the same going forward (2015-2055)?\n\nLets look at the numbers:\n\n\n\nYear | Fed Balance Sheet as % of GDP | M2 Money Supply as % of GDP \n---|---|----|----|----\n1945 | 20% | 70% |\n1984 | 5% | 55% |\n\n**We can see that we basically traded a lower money supply in the general economy for a lower fed balance sheet.  15% of GDP over 40 years (0.375% of GDP per year)...Not too bad! very gradual reduction in the money supply and Fed balance sheet.  Slow enough to not cause any major major shocks** (i realize 1945-1984 did have problems, but no huge depressions)\n_____\n\n**Today the Fed balance sheet as a % of GDP is about 20%.  M2 Money Supply as a % of GDP is at about 65%.  If we can graudally move M2 to GDP ratio to 50%, we should get a Fed balance sheet of 5% of GDP by 2050 or so without any major disruptions.  Thoughts?**  \n\n\nTl;DR Fed Balance Sheet went from 20% of GDP in 1945 to 5% of GDP in 1984...accomplished by the shrinking of money supply from 70% of GDP in 1945 to 55% in 1984.  As Fed Balance Sheet increases, money supply increases, and visa versa.

These two GSEs (government sponsored enterprise) held 70% of subprime mortgages at their peak, as evidence of this, it is argued.\n\nThe counter argument is as follow: in fact, the bubble took off in 2003-2004 when, as wikipedia claims \"The market shifted away from regulated GSE's and radically toward Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) issued by unregulated private-label securitization conduits, typically operated by investment banks.\" In other words, banks started selling mortgages to 'unregulated' securitizers, and they were the ones who really brought down lending standards. It is further claimed that the Fanny and Freddy held loans actually performed better than privately held loans.

{"name": "t3_2s6y0o", "title": "Democratic Republic Resource Based Economy Style Nation: It is time to switch.", "text": "The following is a Q&A I had with a person on FB about how such a style would work.  In the discussion, I am Shad Walker.\n\nIt starts off as a meme of with some gold bricks and the caption \"The dollar was backed by this\"; then cuts to a picture of an aircraft carrier with the caption \"Now its backed by this\".\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\ncWe need to take this understanding to the masses so that we stand up together and say \"no more!\" and \"not in our name!\" The value of the dollar is backed by \"oil dollars\" and everything you consume is tied to other countrys' needs to have \"petrodollar reserves\" just to run their economies. What will the U.S. do when other countries STOP TRADING OIL WITH U.S. CURRENCY? What have they done in the past?\n\n  \n\n\nShad Walker To bad gold is still Fiat. So even when the dollar is back by gold, it is still really only backed by some peoples emotional response of \"want\" to something shiny.\n\nMira Siente anything we put \"faith\" in can be currency. What do you think will replace our currency system in the future? Got any good ideas?\n\nShad Walker Ohh personally I would just like to see us get away from money period. Once you start regulating such systems, that employ money, to the level that would be needed to avoid silly games and loopholes, money itself becomes a moot middle step of resource \n\nMira Siente the problem is the concentration of people in one place so now we have people living on top of people and the means to feed and supply for our needs doesn't come from the land or natural resources- it comes from selling our labor and then exchanging our loot for the things we need to survive. How do we unravel a society dependant on money for survival? I am with you on getting rid of money and going back to a simpler, productive life/society.\n\n\nShad Walker We produce enough food for about 12 billion people, and only have about 7 billion on the planet. That is an extra 5 billion people worth of food. Really, it just comes down to us doing it.\n\nShad Walker I would like to see a Democratic Resource Based Economy Nation. Granted, it would work best worldwide, but there are some countries that have the natural resources to pull it off on a National Level.\n\nMira Siente Who controls the means to produce that much food? The ownership is not shared so profit and control and using labor to make it happen. Money is involved in that equation.\n\nShad Walker If we could get the entire planet in about 3 \"sections\", the Democratic RBE nation, then another section of good arable land for anybody who didn't want to be part of that society. They could go live off the grid, peacefully. Build their own homes, etc.\n\nShad Walker No money is involved, much of the labor would be automated, we have the tech and know how to pull it off. Vertical farms and such. You can get an idea of the kind of designs I am talking about from the Venus Project.\n\nMira Siente and what about the other people not wanting either of those?\n\nMira Siente I'm familiar with the concept and the project.\n\nShad Walker Life doesn't provide us with our little heart's every desire. One will have to cry to whatever higher power they believe in about that. This is about creating a sustainable system that promotes peaceful living as best as we humanly can.\n\nShad Walker But I do also believe in wilderness survival / natural living education in our school systems, so if someone does decide to live out in the off the grid zone, they know how to live naturally.\n\nShad Walker That is the best and closest we can come to the idea of Freedom as humans. You are not being coerced to stay as part of the society by fear of death. You would know you could go off to the other \"zone\" and make it no problem. Even start towns and such out there in which the people decide on other types of systems to employ.\n\nMira Siente Who stands in the way of making your vision work? There are people in every country that wants to make it happen but there are macro and individual forces that don't want your vision. They like the dismal, unfair alternative and they are more powerful than people like us.\n\nShad Walker Hrmmm, that is a good question. I would say at this point, it would be the elite oligarchy, and the masses to an extent. The oligarchy because hey, they don't want to loose their power. And the masses just because they don't know anything else then what they've been trained to know. And they are caught up in all the consumerism and toys.\n\nShad Walker Mainly, it would just be getting the other zone not to go so crazy in resource acquisition that they lead back into the problems we see today; ie pollution and depleting natural resources, especially to the extent where it makes an impact on the other parts of the planet and life.\n\nMira Siente What part of the planet is doing this at the moment? How do the people make new towns? Do they have to move to be a part of the community? Like I said, most like the status quo and don't want to change anything. But I hear you. We need to get off the grid. But even if you do, there will be millions of people wanting to experience a capitalist, consumerist lifestyle (McDonalds are in every part of the world right now). \n\nShad Walker Ohh, I still see restaurants and such in this vision. It is much akin to Star Trek the Next Generation style Earth. There would be forms of entertainment, toys, restaurants and such, just not at a crazy level that depletes the natural resources and such. Getting down to exact minuta is difficult at this point, would need access to information I don't have access too along with bean counters to start counting numbers and see where all the resources stand at. \n\nShad Walker As for parts of the planet, I know Mr. Fresco has been to different countries promoting his idea and a few of them have put banners up. I have also seen small scale RBE communities trying to start up, but nothing large scale that I am aware of.\n\nShad Walker https://www.facebook.com/groups/224148967647327/\n\nBUILD A HYBRID RBE COMMUNITY NOW \n\nShad Walker Getting over the Capitalistic/Consumerist mindset is a hurdle, but it is also what is destroying us. An ugly conundrum.\n\nMira Siente supply and demand. People demand their toys and trinkets but not feeding the world proper nutrition. Food is thrown into the ocean to keep the future speculation commodity price up. The big question is do we create a euphoric society or go after the dominant forces or do we do both? Education is key to make people wake up. They've been trying to wake people up for a long time, We've got to do better and try harder.\n\nShad Walker I guess the simple way to put it would be Military Style without the Military Feel. Realty is, the American Military Structure (along with most militarizes) is a highly Socialist Structure. You participate and you get housing, food, medical care, access to entertainment, etc. Along with a monetary stipend.\n\nShad Walker Highly logistics based, how much do we actually have, how much do we actually need, how do we allocate it, and how do we make sure we are not depleting it.\n\nMira Siente I think a spiritual paradigm shift needs to occur before a RBE can be enacted on a large scale (where people want to make sure they care about future generations and depleted/low natural resources). Like I said, they've got us all living in cities. By 2050, 75% of the world population will be living in cities. Very strong political groups and cliches are and will be running them (city council/business partners/investors). Where will the ordinary people and people living off the grid fit into this reality? \n\nShad Walker Well there seems to be a paradigm shift occurring; more people are becoming aware.\n\nAs to the cities and clicks and such, not too much a concern of mine. The logistics is fairly easy to deal with, that is all hard science and numbers. So can calculate the amount of resources along with how to make sure we are not depleting and polluting them.\n\nIt is the social issues that it becomes grey. Personally I am a fan of a fairly liberal social structure, and if there are more conservative “clicks” within the large liberal structure, that is cool too. Birds of a feather tend to flock together; they just have to remember not to let such trivial issues (ie nudist versus non-nudist) get in the way of the bigger picture. They are still all on the same team, each providing to a society in which we create a comfortable lifestyle with plenty of luxuries.\n\nAs to the “off the grid” people that you asked about, I would need to know, do you mean people who want to live “off the grid” within that society or the “off the grid” in the other zone? \n\nMira Siente Both groups... Back to trying to wrangle control back from the people in power on the local level mainly, but moving further out to the states and on a national level. In the U.S., this concept/project is nowhere near launching and is in the infancy stages of development. Looking at this from an abstract view point is only a percentage of what needs to be done. Years still in the making and more people understanding that the current system isn't working and we need another type of society. Not only that, there will be an anti-movement group forming to silence the RBE movement There are people who think this is communism and they are not going to allow us to move towards a RBE. \n\nShad Walker Ohh it has been getting the hush treatment for years. Heck, Mr. Fresco has been talking about this since the 1970's and was even on Larry King.\n\nShad Walker As to the communism thing, people just have to be \"un-brain washed\" so to speak. This country has been spewing out propaganda about different economic systems since at least the 1950's if not longer. Most don't even realize that economic systems and political systems are 2 different things.\n\nThat is why there are Democratic Socialist Nations; and you can even make Democratic Communist Nations.\n\nThey have been trained to auto respond to those words like a Pavloivan Dog responds to the sound of a bell.\n\nIf they can get through that, then they can start looking at these things clearly. \n\nShad Walker Inanimate systems, each have their strengths and weaknesses. And some are just so flawed, they don't work at all without resets, ie Capitalism. Even ancient man knew it get imbalanced and needed periodic resets; Leviticus 25 and the Time of Jubilee is once such example of ancient people knowing this.\n\nMira Siente Is this a technocratic and bureaucratic society?

My facts may not be dead on, but please work with me. Do correct me if you have a better concept of the facts as I do not claim to be an economist. \n\nFrom what I understand, the general state of wages is that middle class income has not grown since before 2008 (I think there's been considerable shrinkage, actually, due to the recession), and even since the 70's wages have hardly paced with inflation. As more and more wealth becomes concentrated at the top, and debts continue to grow for middle class families (student loans, credit cards, etc.), I can't help but start to see how these pieces seem to fit together in ways that could be more than just incidental. \n\nAs the market expands and the top continues to grow their margins and hide their profits in tax shelters, the rest of the population is left with a smaller piece of economic pie available relative to market growth. This results in having less free capital to spend while costs grow across the board, putting people in a position where they need to borrow more to meet their needs. Since not everyone could qualify for loans to cover things like education, the gov. started facilitating loan qualification/availability in order to encourage more people to achieve higher education. The great availability in funding inevitably inflated education costs - a vicious cycle. \n\nAgain, we're seeing the top take a big chunk of that growth, in this case university presidents raking in millions, which contributes to the inflated education costs.\n\nI cannot draw a straight line through all the details to illustrate the trend, but is there an argument to be made that the uber wealthy have found themselves in a situation where they can suppress the rest of the population *just enough* that people become dependent on borrowing funds to succeed, or even survive - funds that the uber wealthy have stake in, earning them further profits?

I would like to highlight some valid points and make some comments/criticisms:\n\n>- Central banks can only try to fix short-term nominal interest rates; they are not generally able to fix neither long-term interest rates nor the real return on capital. This is true. However, this does not mean that central banks do not influence both. 1º Long-term interest rates should just depend on the long-term supply and demand of capital, but the banking system can modify that equilibrium with maturity mismatching: the practise of borrowing short and lending long sets long-term rates at “artificially low levels” (savers' and investors' time frames are not coordinated from a macroeconomic point of view). Central banks help the banking system to amplify maturity mismatching by providing them with a liquidity safety net. 2º Real return on capital is not an independent variable of malinvestments and overindebtedness: therefore, if maturity mismatching can explain (as I think it can) most of cyclical malinvestment and overindebtedness, then central banks do influence real return on capital.\n\n>- Central banks are not responsible of current ultra-low return on capital (ultra-low interest rates), economic crisis and deleveraging are. Another valid point. Ultra-low rates are not mainly an issue of excessive supply of credit but of lack of new demand for credit. However, it is difficult to think that central banks’ quantitative easings do not have any responsibility in negative interest rates. If you multiply cash availability when no good investment opportunities exist, one will have to store that extra-cash somewhere. Money storage is expensive and Treasury liabilities may be a good deal even at negative interest rates.\n\n>- It is true that central banks must fix some interest rate under a fiat money system. They cannot avoid it as they are the ones in charge of regulating dynamically the monetary base. Therefore it is also true that central bankers need to wonder whether they are fixing a too high or too low rate. However, I have two deep disagreements with the rest of the reasoning. First, central banks interest rates should not depend on the macroeconomic performance of the economy: that is the role of the real return on capital (of real interest rates), not of short-term nominal interest rates. Preferential short-term interest rates (i.e., central bank intervention rates) are a way of advancing money to accrued real earnings (i.e., of providing liquidity where real liquidity pre-exists and is needed, as Bagehot clearly understood): therefore, preferential short-term rates should only depend on lender and borrower liquidity, not on the CPI, the rate of growth and the level of unemployment. The purpose of stimulating the economy by lowering short-term interest rates is tantamount to create a lending boom by stimulating banks to arbitrage short-term and long-term interest rates. This is, I am afraid, a very dangerous path of future malinvestments, bubbles and overindebtedness. Second disagreement: central banks only need to actively fix interest rates under a fiat money system: under a gold standard, interest rates are passively fixed by the evolution of central bank reserves. As I see it, nowadays central bankers do not have any good yardstick for fixing short-term interest rates: they can only try to guess what proper rates should be without actually knowing it and, therefore, without actually knowing whether they are coordinating or discoordinating the real economy (something that was already debated in the Bullionist Controversy). Feedback information comes too late and its meaning is not always clear for central bankers (Are we in an asset bubble? Is the current path of lending sustainable? Has that sector grown too much due to slack credit conditions, etc.). In a sense, they suffer from an inability to apply economic calculation to their business: to be the banker of bankers. And the deep reason for this inability is the one I stated before: central banks should set short-term interest rates according to their liquidity situation, but unfortunately they are the ones in charge of creating the measure of liquidity (monetary base). In other words, what does it mean for a central bank to be “illiquid” under a fiat money system? No answer, no sensible monetary policy.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1427815886.0, "tickers": []}

About 75% of non-conforming borrowers in north England and in Northern Ireland (together, the North) who took out interest-only loans when the market peaked in 2007 are mortgage prisoners.\n\nMortgage prisoners are borrowers who are unable to refinance to a better deal or move house because they fall outside lending criteria.\n\n\"The north-south divide remains firmly entrenched in the sector due to the North's weaker housing market and slower economic recovery,\" observes Emily Rombeau, a Moody's Analyst and author of the report. \"At 54%, over half of northern non-conforming borrowers are mortgage prisoners, compared with 32% of non-conforming borrowers in the rest of the country.\"\n\nOur research shows that about 40% of non-conforming borrowers are mortgage prisoners across the country. Our assessment corresponds to the share of borrowers who (1) have a mortgage with an indexed LTV ratio above 85%; or (2) are more than 30 days in arrears on their payments. An inability to keep up with monthly payments is the main reason for being a mortgage prisoner, accounting for 68% of trapped borrowers.\n\nIn southern England, non-conforming borrowers benefit from at least 9.4% increase in equity in their house on average. Southern England's housing market recovery has outpaced the rest of the country, with property prices rising above pre-crisis peaks in London and south east England.\n\nWe expect that the overall level of mortgage prisoners will continue to moderately decrease over the next 12 months. House price increases will reduce indexed loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, thereby enhancing borrowers' ability to refinance. The LTV ratio is a key driver of defaults in the UK non-conforming residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sector: loans with LTV ratios above 80% have a 2.2x greater likelihood of being repossessed.\n\nIn our base-case scenario, we have not taken borrowers' affordability into consideration when assessing their ability to refinance under current market conditions. We have also assumed that self-certified borrowers did not overstate their income at origination. For example, if we apply a 10% haircut to self-certified borrowers' income and consider that homeowners with a loan-to-income ratio above 3.5x cannot remortgage, the proportion of mortgage prisoners increases to 59% from 38%.\n\nMoreover, if we assume lower indexed LTV ratio cut-off points for interest-only loans, a significantly larger proportion of borrowers would be trapped in their current mortgages. The share of mortgage prisoners rises to 74% from 38% if we assume that interest-only borrowers with an indexed LTV ratio above 50% cannot refinance.\n\nMoody's report, titled \"Northern Non-Conforming UK Borrowers are Almost Twice as Likely to be Mortgage Prisoners,\" is available on www.moodys.com.\n\n(Source: http://fxwire.pro/Moodys-Northern-Non-Conforming-UK-Borrowers-Are-Almost-Twice-Likely-to-be-Caught-In-a-Mortgage-Debt-Trap-19442)\n", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1427760440.0, "tickers": []}

Specifically, the game developer (Blizzard Entertainment) is introducing a mechanism whereby players can, for the first time, purchase \"gold,\" i.e., in-game currency, by giving real USD to Blizzard via the in-game store. Before today, players were only able to exchange USD for \"gold\" by going through third-parties (which violated the Blizzard TOS).\n\nTl;dr: For details on how these tokens will work, see [here.](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18141101/introducing-the-wow-token-3-2-2015)  \n\nBrief explanation of the above link: If a player wants in-game gold, they purchase a WoW token through the in-game store. They then sell this token on the in-game auction house. They receive gold from the player who purchased the token. If a player wants to reduce their credit card expense for playing World of Warcraft, they go to the in-game auction house. They purchase a token that has been put up for sale by another player. They redeem it in-game. Their credit card is not charged by Blizzard during the next billing cycle. A monthly subscription to World of Warcraft costs approximately $15.

A full discussion of Moody's results is included in its just-published report \"Asian Covenant Quality Remains Stronger Than Other Regions' in First Quarter of 2015\".\n\nThe overall average covenant quality score for rated Asian high-yield-bond deals issued in the first quarter of this year was at 2.63; similar to the 2.67 for deals issued in the fourth quarter of 2014, but weaker than the long-run cumulative average of 2.49 for the region.\n\nMoody's measures bond covenant quality on a five-point scale, with 1.0 denoting the strongest investor protections and 5.0, the weakest and assesses bond protections against six risk areas: restricted payments, investments in risky assets, leverage, liens subordination, structural subordination and event risk (change of control).\n\n\"Asian covenant quality is good with a cumulative average of 2.49 at end of Q1 2015, which is significantly stronger than the global average of 3.37,\" says Jake Avayou, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Covenant Officer.\n\n\"We note that in Q1 2015, Indian bonds had the strongest covenant protections. Only Indian and Chinese companies issued bonds during this period,\" adds Avayou.\n\nMoody's points out that the two Indian high-yield bonds issued in Q1 2015 contained fewer quantifiable restricted payments, risky investments, and debt carve-outs when compared with the other bonds issued in the same quarter.\n\nMoody's notes that bond protections against three risk areas -- namely restricted payments, investments in risky assets and change of control -- weakened in the first quarter of 2015 from the protections seen in the last quarter of 2014.\n\nWhen compared to Q4 2014, the restricted payment score weakened to 2.97 (moderate category) from 2.48 (good category), and the investments in risky assets score weakened to 3.45 (weak category) from 2.88 (moderate category).\n\nThe weakness was largely due to four Chinese property companies that pre-dated their income baskets to coincide with their previous bond issuances. This approach increases flexibility to pay dividends, buy back stock and make risky investments with money that could otherwise be used to service the bonds, and is a clear negative for bondholders.\n\nIn addition, two of the four Chinese property deals this quarter further weakened protections against risky investments by allowing free reclassification between their general permitted investment baskets and their restricted payments income baskets.\n\nMoody's notes that the region's protection against event risk related to a change of control weakened to 2.11 in Q1 2015 from 1.71 in Q4 2014. The result was because Country Garden Holdings Company Limited's (Ba2 ratings under review for upgrade) and CAR Inc.'s (Ba1 stable) negative ratings conditions specify that triggering a put on the bonds requires a downgrade by two rating agencies if the notes are rated below investment grade by all three ratings agencies, rather than the usual one.\n\n(Source: http://fxwire.pro/Moodys-Asian-covenant-quality-for-high-yield-bonds-holds-steady-better-than-other-regions-24934)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1429063499.0, "tickers": [["CAR", 1]]}

If the value of the dollar decreases, and oil continues to climb, it becomes economical for a lot of wells to come back online, and production will ramp, and at the same time, if prices are up, then demand will most likely go down.

And, we add about 1 billion people every 15 years...since about 1960, not exactly exponential (thanks for making me look that up.)*\n\n**Another conflict will spill over some borders in the Middle East** /r/arKK\n\n*This is probably the best argument I have got yet, and one that I'm fairly ill equipped to argue. I can say that it is highly speculative, but not really far fetched. I do feel like bringing an end to the control over oil could help the middle east get together for the better good of their nations to export as much oil as they can, but I feel like I should slap myself for saying that.* \n\n**a discovery completely undermining the estimated reserves left** /r/arKK\n\n*again, very speculative for near term, but not far fetched...and something we should be expecting in the future, but how far into the future...who knows. I do know we are growing less dependent on oil, and are moving towards renewables, plus technology evolves.  Since we are being speculative, I pose this question...What happens to the world once humanity figures out how to harness fusion power?...there will be a lot of people who will give a lot less fucks about oil when that happens (and we are very close).*\n\n**Wait, back to OPEC...As far as OPEC goes, they have to do something. At the current price point, OPEC by majority is not happy.**/r/KU76\n\n*Very true. In order for a large portion of OPEC to remain fiscal balance, oil needs to be higher....how much higher?....ridiculously higher. According to Thomsan Reuters it starts at ~$58 for Qatar, and ends at ~$136 for Iran.* \n\nhttp://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/opec/index.html\n\n*Why? Because it's not a private business over there. Fiscal breakeven pays for a majority of their \"government\" expenditures....including subsidies and royal privileges. The cost that it actually takes them to produce a barrel of oil is actually the cheapest on earth. They have been so used to relying on oil production, and having the ability to manipulate the market, that they have grown very used to making a very wide margin. The profits from oil in Saudi Arabia account for ~80% of what the \"government\" spends....which is why on the above Thompsan Reuters chart, it says their breakeven is ~$93.*\n\nhttps://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/oil-revenue-as-a-share-of-government-revenue-opec-member-non-opec-member_chartbuilder.jpg?w=640\n\n*So, it's funny that they are increasing production. Why?...to drive out U.S. shale. But wait, how long are they going to be able to do that for? Not very, even though they have massive reserves, they also have massive expenditures...a few years probably at best. This is where I get speculative, and what this half tard thinks is going on. The thing is, is that this is a bit of an economic war that is going on. Guess who is good at war...and economics? There is a bit of chess going on right now. Shale put OPEC in check. OPEC's only option is to adjust. There is a lot of corruption, a lot of waist, a lot of arrogance...that just got put into check. So it's their move. From the looks of things, I would say they are hell bent on applying the pressure back on Shale...which will work (hasn't quite yet)...but, (I believe at least) it will drive out some competition for a bit...no, not forever. They are going to have to diversify their economies....which is a good thing. Saudi Arabia has openly admitted to this, as well as Putin...and they have been working on it. So, what am I saying? What I have been saying, supply and demand are going to dictate the price of oil....not so much politics and geology. Right now we are oversupplied, and that is going to get worse...for now.*\n\n**why would OPEC shoot themselves in the foot to regain market share from US Shale, that will just as quickly be lost?  Possibly the U.S. hired OPEC to drop oil prices to put the hurt on Russia for the whole Ukraine/Crimea situation last year, which comes with the added benefit of boosting the US economy.** /r/KU76\n\n*I have been beating my head to understand how Russia ties into all this...I've been especially curious as to the recent deviation the Ruble has taken from the price of oil. Most recent signs say that Russia's economy is on the rebound...which doesn't make a whole lot of since in my book. If there are some behind the scenes maneuvering going on, I would say that Russia is doing really good at withstanding it so far, and that gives me more reason to suspect that this June meeting will maintain the current course, until some hurt starts really getting applied to where it is intended to be directed, be it shale or Russia.*\n\n**Also, the majority of new discoveries are shale, deepwater or tar sands. These all need oil around $100 to be viable.** /r/the_ultravixens\n\n*http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php\nJaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*\n\noil sands\n\n*Breakeven costs for existing projects such as Kearl Phase 1 stand at US$42 per barrel, with Husky’s Lloydminster (US$28), Cenvous’ Christina Lake ($26) and Suncor operations (US$30.3), all comfortably below WTI’s current price of US$46 per barrel, Citibank data shows.*\n\nDeepwater\n\n*the average breakeven oil price needed for new deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments in early stages of construction is between $65 and $75 per barrel. That “breakeven” implies a long-term annualized 10% return on capital.*\n\n*Now, there was a lot more money being thrown at all these projects when oil was over $100, and I do agree that there will be a lot less investment if oil stays, or decrease...but like a said, there has already been significant investment in projects to keep supply climbing for the next several years.*\n\n**If you look at the finances of the shale drillers, nobody was running a positive cashflow at $100 per barrel, so there is simply no way that breakevens are $45 outside of the most prolific core areas.** /r/the_ultravixens\n\n*I believe we agree that the most costly oil is deepwater...so I looked up Seadrill's EPS from Q1 '14, and it was $1.58...they most certainly were making money.*\n\n**Wind and solar provide around 1% of global energy, and it's all in the form of electricity. They currently do not fuel aeroplanes, trucks, boats or combine harvesters. In the timescales we're discussing (up to maybe 5-10 years max) they are irrelevant.** /r/the_ultravixens\n\n*You are right here, they are still in their infancies.

Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter recently called for the elimination of cash which would also include higher forms of taxation on currency, among other unpleasantries for the populace.  While he might think this to be a very nice idea for his bank and the US Government, we think not so nice for the rest of us.  But what is the problem really?  After all, the various pundits in the US Government and in various media seem to tell us things are looking up.  However, Bloomberg News asks (as part of the sub-heading in the article about the Buiter comments): Would this save the world economy?   Honestly, if you listen to some other economic commentaries, it would seem the world economy was already saved – or was it?\n\nThe existing real problem of too much debt, too much leverage and exponential use of unregulated (and uncollateralized) derivatives seems to be finally coming home to roost.   The new problem seems to be a lack of liquidity once again, and a lack of collateral – despite all of the QE programs, running of the printing presses (electronically of course) and other initiatives designed to starve off disaster.\n\nMr. Dave Kranzler from Investment Research Dynamics recently highlighted the unusual and exponential use of US Treasury Repo operations recently, leading him to conclude the US Federal Reserve is doing this to once again prop up the banks to coverage margin calls on derivatives (giving them Treasury securities to cover the additional margin).   Interesting enough, with regards to the individual investor, the IMF says that: Margin debt as a percentage of market capitalisation remains higher than it was during the late-1990s stock market bubble. The increasing use of margin debt is occurring in an environment of declining liquidity. \n\nPeter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, says the U.S. dollar’s rise won’t persist because the national economy is staggering and the Federal Reserve is going to delay, yet again, raising interest rates, which will then spark up inflation.  Mr. Schiff also goes on to say that: The US Fed has inflated the mother of all bubbles.\n\nIn short, we are hearing the same thing in general now in April 2015: Not enough Liquidity, Not enough Collateral.  Where did all that QE money go?

Conversely, businesses rely on that resource by trading dollars for effort.\n\nOf course, most natural resources erode if not maintained. The cost of chopping down a tree isn't just the loss of the tree - there's also accelerated soil erosion, reduced space for wildlife, deforestation, and climate change.

Government makes up the difference in a dozen ways: all sorts of economic subsidies; lost employee tax revenue (both employee-side and employer-side); Medicaid (and health issues are exacerbated by the strain of long work hours and sustained financial pressure); worker's compensation; increased risk of personal bankruptcy; and years / decades of public assistance when these people can't work and have no retirement.\n\nAll of this cost is borne entirely by taxpayers.

Any insight welcome.", "text": "Hi, \nAs you may know that discussion of Grexit is just something on-going for a while now, same as everything is debatable, I wonder what your view on Grexit and such impact on EU?\n\nMy perspective is that provided that an exit is practically possible. Greece will exit. Exchange rate will adjust after a period of pain, but it would eventually recover (maybe ?). \n\nHowever, the image of EU which was once thought \"no exit\" union is undermined. How fair is it to some countries with compliance under the commission like Ireland and italy to name but a few. So, once Greece left and other subsequent requests to exit could be anticipated. It's the role of the trio to prevent such chain event from happening, so they would do their utmost to negotiate with Greece. Given Greece as news reported that the finance minister Yanis is a game theorist, (like it or not but this is on the headline) the best they could do is to pretend not cooperating until the best terms are offered.\n\nThings up to the above line suggests a scenario where Greece merely want a better term. On contrary, German is impatient ( as suggested recently, but still on the headline, maybe media trick I don't know), implying perhaps they have enough and determining to end the deal, pushing Greece to finish the negotiation. \n\nI draw the conclusion that a Grexit is possible since Greece still has not agreed on the deal and German are impatient. From a flawed economics term, at least the Greek politician believes that staying in EU is worse than leaving it. i.e. the terms are not favorable enough. While German intend to terminate the deal as  soon as possible. (as Greek debts may continue to grow if they do not comply. And that as the driver of EU economy, German are essentially subsiding Greece) The situation would be that Greece leaves and EU suffer a detrimental impact on sovereign risks on bonds(of course a variety of things but effect on bonds are probably the most immediate), in the worst case resulting in the break up of EU as members are unwilling to underwrite the debts of others.    \n\nFeel free to comment on my logic as well as any insights. It seems to me it is an asymmetric problem where German has the whole EU to worry about, while they obviously cannot leave instantaneously (Would you not blame the German if they hold a referendum tomorrow and exit EU?) in order to prevent the spillover effect of Grexit. On the other hand, Greece is only merely weighting what can bring them a better deal; exit or stay. Apparently, exiting is unprecedented and no one can estimate such impact on an economy. There is well-proved track records of recoveries in history through serious devaluation which is only made possible given the exit. \n\nThank you for your time in reading my lengthy posts. :)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJust as an additional thought, I put it here just not to confuse with the above. Timing of German being impatient (roughly) coincide with potential bond crisis (collapse) discussion in media only a few days ago. Reasoning behind is that bond prices are artificially inflated by ECB. If the market starts to think the impact of Greece leaving and the grim outlook of EU. I would expect bonds prices to go up as higher risk premium are required, a potential greater problem for the Trio and everyone within the EU. \n\nThe UK election outcome shows a further support ,too, to leaving the EU membership as the newly elected prime minister plans to hold a referendum.

Starting in the late 1980s , they successfully pushed for financial services to be included in “ trade ” negotiations, including those establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO). “The sector was truly unique in that respect, and there is little doubt within the trade policy community that financial sector support in the European Union and the United States was a determining force in concluding the FSA [WTO Financial Services Agreement],” notes a study posted on the WTO’s own website.\n\n The WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the financial service chapters of U.S. “ Free Trade ” Agreements (FTA s) limit the regulation of financial service sectors subject to these agreements. \n\nThe United States bound most banking and securities services to comply with these rules and made sizeable commitments in insurance. The “trade” pact rules simply ban many common forms of financial regulation, even if such policies apply to domestic and foreign firms equally. \n\nU.S. government and corporate efforts in trade negotiations complemented domestic lobbying to weaken and eventually repeal the New Deal’s system of banking regulation. For instance, the Glass-Steagall Act created a firewall between commercial and investment banks to prevent the former from speculating with consumers’ savings. \n\nBut the 1997 U.S. WTO commitments noted an intent to change Glass-Steagall to conform with WTO rules. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which did so, passed in 1999 – the year the WTO’s Financial Services Agreement (FSA) took effect. Many people still assume “trade” pacts are about traditional matters, such as tariff cuts. In fact, the WTO, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other U.S. FTAs require signatories – including the United States – to conform domestic policies to a broad non-trade deregulatory agenda. \n\nFew in Congress read the legislation implementing the WTO in 1994 or NAFTA in 1993, much less the pacts’ actual 900-page texts. Congress didn’t even get a vote on the expanded U.S. financial service deregulation commitments contained in the subsequent WTO FSA. But if any country’s laws fail to comply with WTO , NAFTA or FTA rules , the laws can be challenged before foreign tribunals, and the country can be subjected to indefinite trade sanctions until its laws meet “trade” pact dictates. \n\nWhile Congress has worked to reregulate banks and other financial firms since the crisis, it must also confront “trade” agreement rules that conflict with those reforms and require domestic law to conform to the now-rejected model of extreme deregulation that caused the global economic crisis. \n", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1432241471.0, "tickers": []}
{"name": "t3_36s3s5", "title": "The Fall Guy is in Place for the Next Financial Crisis", "text": "An interesting article by Mr. Kolhatkar describes Shadow Banking as being the new buzzword and intended culprit for the next financial crisis (and there will some kind of upheaval coming, although what will trigger it and what form it will take unclear at the moment).  We have worked in the financial industry for about 17 years before becoming involved in our current business (which we have been running for another 17 years so you can deduce my age based upon that).  And the point to be made is that there are a number of financial activities that are either regulated by different authorities, all depending upon the activity or depending upon the corporate structure involved (banks versus say hedge funds), or in some cases perhaps almost not at all.  And of course in recent years the growth of OTC (over the counter) derivatives trading and swaps have ballooned (both in volume and bubble like proportions).  However, it was a former head of the US Federal Reserve Bank that testified to the US Congress that banks are sophisticated financial institutions that need not be interfered with (our words and not the actual testimony, but you get the picture).  But of course if that is the case, then why have they been bailed out with tax-payer money?  The past 2008 financial crisis involved over zealous and sloppy lending standards by the financial institutions as it related to real estate loans, but the next crisis may very well involve derivatives, swaps or both.  If they knew what they were doing with mortgages and mortgage backed securities, and were bailed out when they had gotten into trouble, what makes anyone think this scenario would not be repeated with a possible derivatives problem?  Unless of course they have no intention of getting any funds from the government run deposit insurance or the tax-payers next time and intend to grab it from some place else. \n\nDespite the positive intentions of the 2010 US Dodd-Frank legislation (which addresses OTC derivatives trading among other things) we find it very interesting that a November 16, 2014 G-20 meeting resulted in what Mr. Martin Armstrong calls the case of government walking away from its promises (to protect bank account holders).  Mr. John Lawrence, writing an article dated January 6, 2015 titled: The Bail-In: How You and Your Money Will Be Parted During the Next Banking Crisis (San Diego Free Press) says it quite well:\n\nWhen you deposit money in a checking or savings account, that money no longer belongs to you. Technically and legally, it becomes the property of the bank, and the bank just issues you what amounts to an IOU. As far as the bank is concerned, it’s an unsecured debt.  The way Dodd-Frank has managed to screw things around, derivatives (bets banks have made in the Wall Street casino) have priority over your checking and savings accounts when it comes to paying off their debts. And don’t think that the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) will save your money. The assets of the FDIC are minuscule (in the billions) compared to the valuation of outstanding derivatives (in the trillions). Your deposits are protected only up to the $250,000 insurance limit, and also only to the extent that the FDIC has the money to cover deposit claims or can come up with it.  Ellen Brown asks: What happens when Bank of America or JPMorganChase, which have commingled their massive derivatives casinos with their depositary arms, is propelled into bankruptcy by a major derivatives fiasco?  So, shadow banking, alien invasion or whatever (whomever) that may be called to blame for another financial crisis, it seems the average bank account holder could be at risk.\n", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "created_utc": 1432231109.0, "tickers": []}

Sort of like a pyromaniac refusing to discuss the aftermath of an abandoned warehouse fire.  Although in the case of the Fed, real people were involved.\n\nMr. Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute opines that: While the Fed drove up stock prices, most of which are owned by the wealthy, it also increased the value of housing, which is mostly owned by the middle class (end of quote).\n\nSo, in short, these central bank rescues of the financial sector indirectly benefited owners of real estate and equities, which tend to be assets more likely to be owned by the somewhat more affluent.

The impact on inequality was beside the point.  And if there is a negative impact, it should be offset by fiscal policy.

It reads as follows.  \n\n\"For the purposes of this Agreement…\n\n(b) 'services' includes any service in any sector except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority;\n\n(c) 'a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority' means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers.\" \n\n----- Most current government services fail the second part of the test and will have to be privatized.

Do the TPA, TAA, TISA, TPP, TTIP, WTO - it all must be rejected this week and every week until its gone. \n\nJust as CAFTA completely ignored human rights once enacted, TPP, TISA and TTIP are thoroughly anti-human rights, and TPA and TAA, being NATIONAL laws, are irrelevant to the FTAS. There is another way they are lying. They cannot tell us the truth which is the FTAs go above them and make them powerless, so they have focused on TPA which we should think of as a placebo button that simply starts a process that cannot be stopped which goes on autompilot and the rest is totally irrelevant and is only there to keep the people barking up the wrong tree for a year or three or four while the power to change things without doing the impossible, upsetting this whole system, which could not be done. Because its out of our hands once its created. the only time we can stop it is now, while the vote still exists in the people's hands. That is why the vote tomorrow or Tuesday. is SO IMPORTANT. \n\nLet me show you how much they are lying. \n\n[In this paper you can see how TISA is intended to serve as a laboratory](http://www.wti.org/fileadmin/user_upload/wti.org/institute/pdfs/S1793993314400067.pdf) for global services liberalisation.  Liberalisation means privatization and then globalization. That is the #1 goal. Making sure that firms, nomatter where they are from, who do basically everything, 70% of all jobs are services, \"everything you cannot drop on your foot\" - the priority will be getting the most work for the least money (i.e. living wage and sustainability ARE NOT ON THE MAPS AT ALL) And all \"discrimination\" that is relevant once this change occurrs, is discrimination against corporations by country. What that means is that an appropriate percentage of jobs MUST go to foreign firms or the WTO will step in and start eliminating rules which are perceived as standing in the way. \n\nGoogle phrases like \"WTO\" and \"Necessity Tests\" and \"No more burdensome than necessary\" to see what I mean.  You'll see that professional licensing requirements as well as citizenship or residence requirements will soon be difficult to defend at best and forbidden at worse in contexts where they have always been the norm. Why? because they block foreign firms who will suddenly become ***legally entitled*** to do the work IF they win it by their **\"competitive advantage\"**, low cost. \n\nThings like minimum wages, will be under attack. That is, if they even apply (Since the firms will be foreign and their workers presence here \"temporary\" - less than a few years in any single case, it is possible that they may not, they currently may not with L1 visas based on GATS, it seems. \n\nIn any case, it seems almost no Americans understand this important shift of frame or its implications.)   In the world at large, there has been little in the way of progress on human rights since the WTO was brought into being and it could be argued we've actually gone backwards. SO DONT EXPECT THINGS TO GET BETTER, ENDORSING THIS SYSTEM IS GUARANTEED TO MAKE THINGS WORSE. \n\nHow it is intended to transition huge chunks of the economy into WTO control. What this means is that schools and colleges health care payment (insurance) and health care, and and banking and water and public works and literally everything currently done by the governments FFORDABLY will be forced to be MONETIZED and in that context it will become affordable and in the process in the quest for affordability the fix will be crap-ification inside of GPA. All those government jobs and a lot of non-government contracts will be required to use the WTO's [General procurement Agreement](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gpa_1994_e.htm) in selecting contractors. \n\nThe winning bid will be the lowest bid. \n\n**Also, any kinds of local discrimination (for example, selecting women owned or minority firms or preferring local firms, is only allowed in poor countries, rich countries have to just take the winning bids.)**  See Technical Barriers to Trade web page. And READ EVERY WORD CRITICALLY because a lot of change can be contained in a few innocuous looking words **YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR TRADE LINGO, YOU HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT THERE, NO WORDS MEAN WHAT THEY SEEM TO MEAN.**\n\n**I cannot over emphasize this- the legal standard is that NO law or regulation can be allowed that has the effect of inhibiting trade, - the legal standard is  \"no more burdensome than necessary\"**  \n\n***That means this shift will literally turn our world upside down.***\n\nAlso, get those frames where you expect jobs to go to Americans out of your mind, they likely wont. After all, we have to charge more. Because of our costs of living. \n\n**The winning bids will come from the countries with the most favorable regulatory environment, meaning in many cases, the lowest wages. They will do work here. Millions of jobs will go to them. this is their payoff for globalization.**\n\nThat's the whole idea!", "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1434300773.0, "tickers": [["AN", 1]]}

Calls for a minimum wage increase aren't coming from the unskilled entry-level, however. It is people who have years of experience and have accumulated skills that they can not figure out how to better monetize that are asking for relief.\n\nThe underlying problem, I think, is information. For the laborer there is no understanding of what his/her skills are truly worth, where they can be applied, what skill gaps he/she needs to cover, and whether the return in increased wages justifies the cost. Employers also often aren't quite sure of what they are looking for or what is a fair wage. \n\nI wonder if the solution to this information problem might be a structure not unlike a commodities market: a group of brokers agree to do business within the exchange. The brokers develop labor descriptions including required qualifications and length of service. Prospective laborers submit proof of qualification (possibly with certification services provided through the broker, or a third party) and agree to provide service for the time period(s) he/she is selling. Prospective employers make a buy order for service through a broker who matches the order to sell orders by other brokers within the group. Default risk (employee not showing up, failing to be qualified as stated, on the job injury, or employer backing out) is borne by insurers who insure both parties; and the broker (or a third party clearing house) could offer substitution to prevent default. Daily trade volume and price information is published in the newspaper, where other prospective laborers learn what skills are in demand (due to volume), and what those skills are worth. Prospective employers likewise learn the same. \n\nI think this might be a good, market based way of solving the problem.

Not being tied to a specific corporation would mean higher wages.\n\nConsidering the huge change that these \"labor mobility\" provisions could potentially create in society, its surprising that there has been so little questioning of these provisions. For example, tying workers to a specific corporation, likely to be huge corporations, creates a situation where the workers have no ability to negotiate on any level. Additionally, in the US, the current deals appear to utilize non-immigrant, treaty related visas that seem to have no requirement for prevailing or even minimum wages to be paid while the workers are working in the US. It appears there is no minimum wage requirement at all. Additionally, licensing requirements may be forced through a harmonization process that would seem to force a lowest common denominator approach. And where do the self employed and small state and one-nation companies fit into the picture. They don't, they seem to have no place in the current/pending systems.

Nations will also then be prevented from using services jobs as bargaining chips to gain concessions.

But you didn’t see that in me, instead your employees were quick to judge, quick to gauge, and very slow in providing any real service. Was it a privilege to shop at your store? Did my hundreds of dollars in cash not qualify at your store? Why was my money no good to you? You even hired security guards to further perpetuate your ignorant mindset. I walk into all of your stores and see the same discrimination. Walkers following me, security guards following me, staff following me with the lowest of intentions.

{"name": "t3_3qdfdu", "title": "The Time Elapsed Historical View On Our Consumption", "text": "For many, many years before humans ever walked upon this planet, it was already growing a variety of plant and animal species.  The universe and creation of the Earth itself deposited the different metals and minerals we harvest from it.  Other metals and minerals are formed by the various natural systems the Earth goes through, such as the movement of the tectonic plates.  Or the forming of diamonds from coal being exposed to intense heat and pressure.\n\nDuring this time, since no beings were really harvesting the various resources, the Earth began to form a stockpile of all of these things, including the various forms of life.  Over millions of years it formed these stockpiles, such as fossil fuels (oil / gas).\n\n\"Contrary to what many people believe, fossil fuels are not the remains of dead dinosaurs. In fact, most of the fossil fuels we find today were formed millions of years before the first dinosaurs.\n\nFossil fuels, however, were once alive!\n\nThey were formed from prehistoric plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago.\n\nThink about what the Earth must have looked like 300 million years or so ago. The land masses we live on today were just forming. There were swamps and bogs everywhere. The climate was warmer. Ancient trees and plants grew everywhere. Strange looking animals walked on the land, and just as weird looking fish swam in the rivers and seas. Tiny one-celled organisms called protoplankton floated in the ocean.\n\nWhen these ancient living things died, they decomposed and became buried under layers and layers of mud, rock, and sand. Eventually, hundreds and sometimes thousands of feet of earth covered them. In some areas, the decomposing materials were covered by ancient seas, then the seas dried up and receded.\n\nDuring the millions of years that passed, the dead plants and animals slowly decomposed into organic materials and formed fossil fuels. Different types of fossil fuels were formed depending on what combination of animal and plant debris was present, how long the material was buried, and what conditions of temperature and pressure existed when they were decomposing.\n\nFor example, oil and natural gas were created from organisms that lived in the water and were buried under ocean or river sediments. Long after the great prehistoric seas and rivers vanished, heat, pressure and bacteria combined to compress and \"cook\" the organic material under layers of silt. In most areas, a thick liquid called oil formed first, but in deeper, hot regions underground, the cooking process continued until natural gas was formed. Over time, some of this oil and natural gas began working its way upward through the earth's crust until they ran into rock formations called \"caprocks\" that are dense enough to prevent them from seeping to the surface. It is from under these caprocks that most oil and natural gas is produced today.\"\n\nhttp://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html\n\nWe can view this natural supply as a savings account, that our mother (Mother Nature) had set up for us before we were ever born. And over the years, it grew and grew. Then humans came into the picture and we eventually started to harvest the different resources. We hunted the different animals for food and clothing, along with other various body parts for materials to build tools. We gathered plants for food and material for various tools and structures. At first, like most other species, our numbers and cumulative harvesting habits were in a small enough amount that the natural functions of the planet could keep pace.\n\nIt would be akin to us making withdrawals from the \"savings account\"; as long as they were small enough amounts spaced out, the interest rate would keep up so we did not start having a negative growth rate and possibly even keep a positive growth rate if they were small enough. So it seemed we could never run out. But then we learned different techniques to increase our harvesting rate, and our numbers grew so even more people were harvesting at ever faster and faster rates. Then came the Industrial Revolution which exponentially increased our speed of harvesting, all the meanwhile our species grew in number. And now we are in the automation age, along with being funneled into a Consumerist and Disposable Goods lifestyle / behavior patterns.\n\n\"For most of human history man has been a hunter and gatherer; although his use of fire, and local over-population, may have altered the environment, the consequences of his actions were small compared with those of farmers. Plants and animals were first domesticated some 12-10000 years ago, and sedentary agriculture slowly became established in most parts of the world.\" David Grigg; The Industrial Revolution and Land Transformation; Chap 4, Intro\n\nhttp://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_32/SCOPE_32_1.4_Chapter4_79-109.pdf\n\nQuite a while ago, we started dipping into that savings account of resources Mother Nature had set up, to the point in which we are outpacing the \"interest rate\" so we effectively have a negative growth rate.\n\nAnother analogy I have used in the past incorporates that old idea of endless wells that so many used to see our supply of resources as. They have never been endless wells (with a few exceptions such as wind and hydroelectric power); they have always been more akin to wells that refill slowly over time. And we are taking from the well faster than it can replenish itself. And some of these wells can not replenish at all if they are totally emptied, such as an animal species. If we get the population so low, that species eventually goes extinct. And once it is extinct, we can not get it back.\n\nBut to consistently grow a metric known as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) we must continue this pattern. To keep the masses enthralled and distracted, we must continue this pattern. To keep a small elite group in power over the rest of humanity, we must continue this pattern.\n\nWe can see where this pattern leads to, so do we want to continue this pattern?\n\nWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n\nHere in America, are we living up to the idea of securing the \"Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\" if we let ourselves run out of resources and don't leave any for future Americans? Do we even secure our own Liberty if we allow economic models that allow small private groups to take full control (privatize) of various resources?\n\nColonel Lawrence Wilkerson: Former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell on unfettered consumerism\n\n\"“My generation, the generation right after my generation; I think we forgot that little phrase in the preamble of our Constitution which says “and our Posterity”, all of the sudden it became “us”, period.”\n\nhttp://www.tubechop.com/watch/7066843\n\nFrom the same documentary, Professor Noam Chomsky states:\n\n\"“Human beings are complex creatures. I mean for example, we are capable right now, at this minute, of acting, in such a way as too, make it likely if not certain that our grandchildren are going to face terrible disasters. And we are consciously acting too accelerate that likelihood even though we all love our grandchildren. How can you be more contradictory then that?”\n\nhttp://www.tubechop.com/watch/7066860\n\nThese are the problems faced when dealing with any Consumerist Based Economic Model, which includes Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, or any hybrid variation of said models.\n\n\"  \"sustainable development.\" In the past, the mainstream theories and models of development hardly addressed the critical environmental and ecological issues. For instance, development theories within the conservative tradition, including various economic growth theories and modernization theories, are predominantly concerned with how to enchance economikc growth and accumulation, efficient production and allocation, political stability and order, and entrepreneurial culture and personality, but they are often indifferent towards the environmental costs of economioc production and accumulation. Similarly, the tradition of radical development theories, including classical Marxist and neo-Marxist theories (except Marzian environmentalists such as M.R. Redclift, James O'Connor, and Barry Commoner), tends to deal with variou modes of production, production relations, and class structures whikle overlooking the question of environmental disorders and ecological damages caused by capitalist production of environmental disorders and ecological damages caused by capitalist produciton and industrial expansion. Radical dependency theories explain the existing world capitalist system based on unequal exchange and center-periphery dependency as the main cause of underdevelopment, but they hardly deal with intergenerational dependency and underdevelopment cause by environmental challenges such as depletion of nonrenewable resources and decline of biodiversity.

What those who take approach have apparently failed to realize is that the systems associated with the crises are not seperate and distinct.

So the use of these non-immigrant labour mobility provisions is likely to be a big payoff for the labour providing less developed countries, and indigenous workers in developed countries are likely to see losses as their jobs are privatized and globalized. The non-immigrant visas must be granted- are likely to skyrocket and the workers thus made available may be very cheap. There may be no rules requiring their international corporate employers to pay them any more than they are paid by mutual agreement. Local wage laws such as those in US and in states and municipalities may end up being pressured into elimination due to their preventing local companies from competing for the newly privatized jobs in their local workers former workplaces, now privatized.

A recent summary of the TiSA negotiations published by an East African group leads me to believe that the US position is one which may not be popular, due to its costs and likelihood to require workers being given raises simply because they are temporarily in the US, while their firms see their low wages as a principal reason they are likely to win bids for future service contracts under the \"progressive liberalisation\" scheme, which will force large portions of the public sector in signatory nations to privatize and globalize, using the revised WTO Government Procurement Agreement's (revised \"GPA\") e-tendering system.

What do other countries do when a floating Riyal increases volatility in the oil market?\n\n- Say they keep the peg, but they devalue.

Which they can do because of their market power right?\n\nDoes the wage really play that big of role in the profit margins of big business that it would notably inflate the prices of goods or force closures of branches by forcing big business to pay a $15 minimum wage whilst allowing small business to retain the lower minimum wage?\n\nI mean just because the minimum wage would go up 200 or 300% I doubt one would see prices going up that much in big business to offset it. I don't know the particulars of the alternative (people being proportionately culled/stores being closed down) but surely the amount of employment that big business contributes won't change that much because they will still have a minimum number of workers they need to run the store (assuming that it is still running profitably as a big business entity)\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is from the non-economical perspective. i.e. just because small business is in a more fragile position than big business it doesn't mean that different rules should be applied to them because a standard of living should be a right given to all people equally, regardless of whether they are employed in small or big business. But this doesn't make sense to me because otherwise we wouldn't have laws like Australia's small business tax one right?\n\nHow far off the mark am I here?", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1452223185.0, "tickers": []}

Some days, you’ll cook at home, and that’s like 10 dollars for the entire day.\n\nIf you pay extra to get more than a room, despite you getting peace and quite in your room and being able to cook and whatnot and being undisturbed, that’s luxury.\n\nNow look at those who make 18,000 or less. 40 percent of 18,000? That’s less than 9,000 a year. You’re homeless. Oh, you make less than 18,000? We’ll give you reduced tax, 30%. 30% of 17,000? That’s less than 6,000 a year; you’re homeless.\n\nPeople making minimum or less than minimum wage are the ones doing the most of the sweating and bleeding just to get by, and even the little they make, is getting a huge portion of it taken away, when they couldn’t even get by in the first place.\n\nNo one really gave a fuck about them nor gave them a break, and if they want help, they have to go through painstakingly stressful and time-consuming procedures to apply and wait and do things they have no time for because their every waking hour consists of mechanical slave labor and suffering.\n\nThey don’t even have time to complain. Only when they had enough and say ‘fuck it’ and go bonkers, do they have the time to do anything, like complain about the fucked up system.\n\n\nBut those who actually have a livelihood and get to do things that a person would want, they complain about the percentage that is being removed from their wages, despite having something to work with after taxes?\n\nPeople who make minimum or near minimum wage don't have hobbies, they have sleep and work; that's it.\n\nNo one helps them because they have no fucking time to do anything but to work, so their voices aren't heard, they're the ones listening to the bitchass customer being a spoiled brat. They're the ones droning their lives and being buttfucked by privileged people in fortunate circumstances, whom have the time and the money and resources to bitch and complain about their well-being not being well enough.\n\n1,000 dollars is a lot to someone who makes 1,000 per month.\n\nYou got taxed 25,000 dollars for your year?

That is what democracy means — and rightly so. If they feel sufficiently cheated and humiliated, they will vote for Donald Trump, a candidate for the Republican party’s presidential nomination in the US, Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France or Nigel Farage of the UK Independence party. \nThere are those, particularly the native working class, who are seduced by the siren song of politicians who combine the nativism of the hard right, the statism of the hard left and the authoritarianism of both.\n\n>Above all, they reject the elites that dominate the economic and cultural lives of their countries: those assembled last week in Davos for the World Economic Forum. The potential consequences are frightening. Elites need to work out intelligent responses. It might already be too late to do so.\n\n>The projects of the rightwing elite have long been low marginal tax rates, liberal immigration, globalisation, curbs on costly “entitlement programmes”, deregulated labour markets and maximisation of shareholder value. The projects of the leftwing elite have been liberal immigration (again), multiculturalism, secularism, diversity, choice on abortion, and racial and gender equality. Libertarians embrace the causes of the elites of both sides; that is why they are a tiny minority.\n\n>In the process, elites have become detached from domestic loyalties and concerns, forming instead a global super-elite. It is not hard to see why ordinary people, notably native-born men, are alienated. They are losers, at least relatively; they do not share equally in the gains. They feel used and abused. After the financial crisis and slow recovery in standards of living, they see elites as incompetent and predatory. The surprise is not that many are angry but that so many are not.\n\n>Branko Milanovic, formerly of the World Bank, has shown that only two parts of the global income distribution enjoyed virtually no gains in real incomes between 1988 and 2008: the poorest five percentiles and those between the 75th and the 90th percentile. The latter includes the bulk of the population of high-income countries.\n\n>Mr Trump is protectionist on trade and hostile on immigration. These positions appeal to his supporters because they understand they have one valuable asset: their citizenship. They do not want to share this with countless outsiders. The same is true for supporters of Ms le Pen or or Mr Farage.\n\n>Nativist populists must not win. We know that story: it ends very badly. In the case of the US, the outcome would have grave global significance. America was the founder and remains guarantor of our global liberal order. The world desperately needs well-informed US leadership. Mr Trump cannot provide this. The results could be catastrophic. \n\n>Western countries are democracies. These states still provide the legal and institutional underpinnings of the global economic order. If western elites despise the concerns of the many, the latter will withdraw their consent for the elite’s projects. In the US, elites of the right, having sown the wind, are reaping the whirlwind. But this has happened only because elites of the left have lost the allegiance of swaths of the native middle classes.\n\n>Not least, democracy means government by all citizens. If rights of abode, still more of citizenship, are not protected, this dangerous resentment will grow.

Here is the summary from the Wikipedia article (emphasis added by me):\n\nHowever, **Tufts University economists argued that the research by Petri relied on unrealistic assumptions such as full employment: lost jobs will be immediately replaced in other industrial sectors**.\n\n**The Tufts researchers published a report of the TPP's economic effects, which said that the TPP would have a negative impact on employment: 450,000 US jobs, 75,000 Japanese jobs, 58,000 Canadian jobs and 5,000 New Zealand jobs would be lost by 2025**. According to the report, **771,000 jobs would be lost in total and positive economic effects would be negligible for participating countries**.\n\n**Abstract of the paper**:\n\nProponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) emphasize its prospective economic benefits, with economic growth increasing due to rising trade volumes and investment. \n\nWidely cited projections suggest modest GDP gains after ten years, varying from less than half a percentage point in the United States to 13 percent in Vietnam. However, these projections assume full employment and constant income distribution in all countries excluding some of the major risks of trade liberalization.\n\nIn this paper, we provide alternative projections of the TPP’s economic effects using the United Nations Global Policy Model. Allowing for changes in employment and income distribution, we obtain very different results. We find that the benefits to economic growth are even smaller than those projected with full-employment models, and are negative for Japan and the United States. More important, we find that the TPP will likely lead to losses in employment and increases in inequality.", "score": 151, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "created_utc": 1461627518.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_4i5zlh", "title": "The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to legalize corruption", "text": "**Welcome to the oligarchy - Please bend over for your corporate masters**\n\n* The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United marches like a zombie precedent, destroying all in its path. First the case turned the law of campaign finance into a useless corpse. Now it appears the law of political bribery is the next victim. Citizens United let rich people buy candidates; now they may be able to purchase office-holders, too.\n\n* That’s the message from the Court’s argument last week in the appeal of Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia. He was convicted, along with his wife, in a scheme that netted the onetime First Family of the Commonwealth about a hundred and seventy-seven thousand dollars in loans, vacations, and luxury goods from a Richmond businessman. And yet, while the statements of Justices during oral arguments are not always perfect predictors of how they will vote, there was clearly a great deal of bipartisan sympathy on display for this appalling former public servant.\n\n* In the McDonnell case, his lawyers argued that what federal prosecutors called bribery was also really just speech by Jonnie R. Williams, the McDonnells’ benefactor. Noel Francisco, McDonnell’s lawyer, did a skillful job of giving a constitutional gloss to the seedy facts of his client’s case. Williams plied the McDonnell family with expensive vacations, a Rolex watch, fifteen thousand dollars for their daughter’s wedding reception, the use of a Ferrari, and a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in loans in an effort to get the governor to promote Williams’s nutritional-supplement enterprise. According to Francisco, Williams was only paying for access (which is generally legal), not government action (which is not). As the lawyer put it in his oral argument, “The line is between access to decision-makers, on the one hand, and trying to influence those decisions, on the other.” In this view, it’s permissible for McDonnell to be paid for official access, just not for official acts.\n\n* The Court seems determined to define quid pro quo so narrowly that it’s practically impossible to find.\n\n* McDonnell’s lawyer argued, there was no quid pro quo because McDonnell did not take an official action on behalf of Williams’s supplements. All the governor did was host a luncheon to announce the launch of Williams’s new product and set up meetings for Williams with officials at the University of Virginia’s medical school. \n\n* Justice Stephen Breyer seemed especially concerned about the other side of the charged quid pro quo. He appeared to assert that a conviction of McDonnell would criminalize normal interactions between citizens and government officials. *“For better or for worse, it puts at risk behavior that is common, particularly when the quid is a lunch or a baseball ticket, throughout this country,”* Breyer told Michael Dreeben, the Deputy Solicitor General, who represented the government. Wouldn’t a conviction here criminalize such trivial exchanges? No, Dreeben said, because *“there is a very critical protection here. It’s a requirement of showing something beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.\"* If the amounts were trivial, jurors wouldn’t convict.\n\n* As in Citizens United, the Justices appeared heading toward requiring a specific and obvious quid pro quo—a formalism that ignored the workings of the real world. The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to legalize corruption\n\n[The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-supreme-court-gets-ready-to-legalize-corruption) / [More on NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/27/475898651/supreme-court-may-be-leaning-toward-voiding-ex-va-governors-corruption-convictio)", "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "created_utc": 1462553779.0, "tickers": []}

The British are completely owned.

On Monday, a British civil servant was photographed arriving in Downing Street for a national security council meeting with an open document in his hand. We could read for ourselves lines from a confidential report on how Prime Minister David Cameron’s government should respond to the Crimea crisis. It recommended that Britain should “not support, for now, trade sanctions,” nor should it “close London’s financial center to Russians.”\n\n>The White House has imposed visa restrictions on some Russian officials, and President Obama has issued an executive order enabling further sanctions. But Britain has already undermined any unified action by putting profit first.\n\n>It boils down to this: Britain is ready to betray the United States, to protect the City of London’s hold on dirty Russian money. And forget about Ukraine.\n\n>\nBritain, open for business, no longer has a “mission.” Any moralizing remnant of the British Empire is gone; it has turned back to the pirate England of Sir Walter Raleigh. Britain’s ruling class has decayed to the point where its first priority is protecting its cut of Russian money — even as Russian armored personnel carriers rumble around the streets of Sevastopol. But the establishment understands that, in the 21st century, what matters are banks, not tanks.\n\n>The Russians also understand this. They know that London is a center of Russian corruption, that their loot plunges into Britain’s empire of tax havens — from Gibraltar to Jersey, from the Cayman Islands to the British Virgin Islands — on which the sun never sets.\n\n>British residency is up for sale. “Investor visas” can be purchased, starting at £1 million ($1.6 million). London lawyers in the Commercial Court now get 60 percent of their work from Russian and Eastern European clients. More than 50 Russia-based companies swell the trade at London’s Stock Exchange. The planning regulations have been scrapped, and along the Thames, up go spires of steel and glass for the hedge-funding class.\n\n>Britain’s bright young things now become consultants, art dealers, private banker and hedge funders. Or, to put it another way, the oligarchs’ valets.\n\n>\nRussia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, gets it: you pay them, you own them. Mr. Putin was absolutely certain that Britain’s managers — shuttling through the revolving door between cabinet posts and financial boards — would never give up their fees and commissions from the oligarchs’ billions. He was right.\n\n>In the austerity years of zero growth that followed the 2008 financial crash, this new source of vast wealth could not be resisted.\n\n>This is Britain’s growth business today: laundering oligarchs’ dirty billions, laundering their dirty reputations.\n\n>The Shard encapsulates the new hierarchy of the city. On the top floors, “ultra high net worth individuals” entertain escorts in luxury apartments. By day, on floors below, investment bankers trade incomprehensible derivatives.\n\n>\nCome nightfall, the elevators are full of African cleaners, paid next to nothing and treated as nonexistent. The acres of glass windows are scrubbed by Polish laborers, who sleep four to a room in bedsit slums. And near the Shard are the immigrants from Lithuania and Romania, who broke their backs on construction sites, but are now destitute and whiling away their hours along the banks of the Thames.\n\n>The Shard is London, a symbol of a city where oligarchs are celebrated and migrants are exploited but that pretends to be a multicultural utopia. \n\n>Here, in their capital city, the English are no longer calling the shots.

Very often after an initial success they took over the company leaving the founder out of business. Investment crowdfunding is very different in this sense since the number of potential borrowers is huge it is not that easy for anyone to take over the company. It means a higher level of security for the potential founder.\n* Cost effectiveness - entrepreneur is almost always winning when he is financing his enterprise through crowd-funding platforms, most of the banks seem to lose interest in small business and prefer huge corporations to them. Interest rates proposed by these banks usually also too big. Investment crowd-funding gives an entrepreneur incredible opportunities to find a very cheap source of credit.\n* True alternative to a stock market investing - as we all know, almost all the companies experience their highest growth in their first three-five years, so by investing in a company at the seed phase potentially you can receive higher returns than you can get in the stock market.\n\nWhat do you think about investment crowd-funding?

I have a friend who lives in Stockholm that she has a 2 years old daughter and she has just put her daughter in the queue system so she can rent a nice apartment when she turns 18. The time to get a first hand contract there is even longer, and apparently many people do that. I think this is very odd. \n\n>Then, since it is difficult to get a first hand rental contract, many newcomers get a second hand contract, which are then subject to higher prices, in many cases, since the person who owns the first hand contract can chose the price. This is what happens in many countries, where the prices are usually not well regulated. These second hand contracts are usually offered at Blocket or Facebook groups (beware the scams on these groups, they are everywhere, but they are also easy to spot.

Not by definition of presumed expertise. Not even with their usury PhD’s, degrees’ & doctorates that would otherwise have you all irrationally believing they are experts in economics.\n\nWhere most people go terribly wrong today including pretend economists is to just assume any increase in debt is just printing too much money equal to that sum of debt & there are really only two errors in this irrational method of deduction.\n\n1) They’re failing to even recognize the total sum of debt purportedly owed to a bank is a sum principal & interest , therefore failing to even conclude the circulation is only ever comprised of the principal that we purport borrow into circulation in our personal debts in the fist place, much less ever contemplating the sum of interest is neither created or issued into circulation above the sum of principal.\n\n2) They’re likewise failing to see national debt, bailouts, even QE is not ever introducing any new money into circulation, failing to conclude national debt can only be instead a process that perpetually reflates a forever deficient circulation that’s always, always, always in a state of perpetual deflation, where national debt only ever perpetually reflates circulation with the same principal & interest we all formerly pay out of circulation, not only on all our personal falsified debts, but as consequence when each & every one of us spends money today.\n\nNow if people did see these two simple irrefutable errors of fact in their assumptions they would naturally deduce its not inflation at all that causes today’s price inflation, but instead deflation, its the added cost of interest that industry & commerce passes on to the consumer in resulting price of goods & services, that can only ever irreversibly multiply artificial debt, stealing all that much further from us.\n\nI mean we all blindly participate in this mass deception of inflation when we trade in business & commerce today, but people refuse to actually see it for what it really is sadly, most people would rather look at the escalation of artificial debt & just irrationally blame non-existent inflation or printing too much money without even thinking twice, much like the insane contradictory paradox of GDP that asserts today’s non-existent inflation is somehow still inflation, wholly artificial only in price, that’s indicating alleged growth in GDP, which can only ever be otherwise growth (deflation) entirely dedicated to service an ever greater escalation of artificial debt that’s mathematically impossible to pay down due to interest.\n\nhttps://australia4mpe.wordpress.com/ http://www.perfecteconomy.com/pg-mpe-108-circulatory-inflation-and-price-inflation-explained.html http://www.perfecteconomy.com/pg-mpe-109-circulatory-deflation-and-deficient-circulation.html", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "created_utc": 1472289653.0, "tickers": []}

This had the effect of massively boosting Hibor, the rate at which Hong Kong lenders charge overseas borrowers for the yuan.\n\nTheir key motives for doing this are:\n\n1. China would prefer that the yuan is strong before the Fed meet later this week, since the chance of a hike is higher due to positive US core inflation data.\n2. China would prefer that the yuan is strong when it is added to the basket of IMF reserve currencies later this month.\n\nMy question is, in points 1 & 2 above, why do China want a strong currency? Won't including it in the IMF reserve give it a greater overseas demand since it can be used for IMF-related matters, strengthening it? If the rate is hiked then it becomes more expensive to borrow the dollar mainly, so China does not want the yuan to become a cheap alternative?

My father had founded and operated a small exporting business, majority of his trade going to and from South-Eastern nations such as Vietnam, Thailand, etc. His company was lost and our family executed an exodus to the United States of America to seek sanctuary and a new life.\n\nI have read numerous articles regarding the event in both Korean and foreign sources. I am still having a difficulty understanding what truly transpired.\n\nFrom what I understand, was this unfortunate event kind of like a domino effect, where one nation fell after another? \n\nDo correct me if I am wrong. \n\n* Korean economy basically crashed in the late 1990s. Caused major corporations to simply cease existing. Because of the nation's reliance on *jaebuls* or corporations, it caused a massive ripple effect, causing hundreds and thousands of businesses, small or large, to fail with it.\n\n* Because of Korea's sudden emergence as one of the top Asian powerhouses (militarily, economically, etc.) since the Korean war, many Koreans grew more and more proud. *I do admit, it is a tremendous feat as a nation to recover so quickly after devastation.*\n\n* These so called *jaebuls* or corporations were blinded by the sight of money. As the Korean moguls and corporations became more and more proud and corrupted, they simply started to borrow money to capitalize the benefits of continuously quick expansion without thinking much about the possible consequences led to the nation's economic downfall.\n\nNow, my question is:  **how exactly did this start, for what reason, the process in which how it occurred, and the aftermath?**\n\nAny details to shed some light on this unfortunate event will be greatly appreciated.

I decided to read over future trumps tax plan.\n\n\n\nIn this tax plan he states:\n\"The Trump Plan will lower the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. This rate is available to all businesses, both small and large, that want to retain the profits within the business.\"\n\n\n\nNow it is unlikely that the rate will be dropped down to 15%. More realistically it would be 20% which aligns with the plan of the speaker of the house of Representatives, Mr. Paul Ryan. That's still 15% less in taxes ALL companies would have to pay.\n\n\n\nNow here is my question. Where does this money go?\n\n\n\nI suppose the hope is to have it go back into the company to help it grow but realistically it would go into the pocket of the major owners.\n\n\n\nWhat if future president Trump forced the companies to invest that 15% into its employees?\n\n\n\n\nFor instance: A company that makes $50 million a year at a tax rate of 35% would pay  $17.5 million in taxes. A company making the same but being taxed 20% would pay $10 million in taxes. That's $7.5 million they would be forced to give to their employees. If said company had 1,000 employees that would equal to a $7,500 salary increase for every employee.\n\n\n\n\nWouldn't this be more beneficial?

I am interested to know how an economy of non-perishable goods (such as diamonds or virtual items, for instance skins in Counter-strike) works. What I am specifacaly curious about is how a closed market of non-perishable goods would work, especially if new non-perishable items were constantly added to it.\n\nAnyway, to further illustrate, lets say you have a game, in which you can obtain these non-perishable goods by playing (skins, items, anything that will never be consumed out of the system) and you can put the obtained items on the games closed market (not on steams market but a specific market in which only the games goods can be bought or sold) for the price you want to. The money can be put into the market, by a person adding it to his accounts balance, or taken out of it when a person reaches a certain ammount (you can take out 50$ but not 49.99$ for instance). \n\nThe server provider would tax a small amount of each transaction to support the further development of the game. In case of inflations, since the items are non-perishable and can be created infinetly, and one person does not benefit from having several copies of the same item, some common items would soon become extreamly cheap and not worth selling. In that case the server provider would offer a better deal to sellers (0.5$ instead of 0.1$ for instance) and basically take out the excess goods, keeping inflation in check. The server provider would't destroy these cards, but would also take part in economy by later releasing bundless of items. The game would also periodically release new obtainable and diverse items, so there would, theoretically be no point at which everyone has everything they want to and have no need to participate in economy. I also want to point out that people would be able to participate in selling goods without ever putting cash in (besides a small amount to cover tax, or they would get taxed once they earn money, not before the transaction). \n\nI'm trying to create a system in which players could actually 'work' by playing the game and selling the goods, while others, which don't have as much time because of real world job, would pay to gain those goods without consuming time. Basically a game in which the players could support members of its community via market. You don't have money but have time, you can basically 'hire' yourself to produce goods (and content for multiplayer, as you are the content) and earn monry that way, or you have money but don't have time, you can spend that money to save yourself time and enjoy what you want to enjoy. \n\nIm just lerning economy, so if anything here made you cringe because it's not achiavable, I do appologize.

Every one who seeks to further there education will receive credits upon completing the courses. these credits can be used to purchase only basic survival goods and services such as food and shelter. You have to join the workforce in order to spend your credits, and you have to complete some sort of continuing education. some credits could be worth more to drive competition and fulfill demand for specialists i.e. doctors. As an educated part of the workforce and survival covered you can earn more income and help your business produce more, which means higher taxes, and to make sure  the wealth is evenly distributed with a flat percentage tax. This is a necessary trade off to afford the education and cost of goods and services. With the rise of human capital through education productivity and efficiency of good and service will be on a steady increase. The average cost of living in the U.S. was $2,371 a month, now obviously that would be a lot lower since we only cover survival goods. the average cost for a student in one year is $15,009. the average cost per person in this idea is $17,400. with the 20.2 million students we have now the total is $70.3 billion/yr. I know that a lot of money, however In 2015, adults with bachelor's degrees took home more than those with high school diplomas.

It will be an even lower percentage of people being able to invest or save any money due to it being to hard to live and save anything. It is a capitalist system that will inevitably become a slave work system. Meaning you will only make enough money to eat and go back to standard living without any form of entertainment because you will not be able to afford it.

Aka, Modern Economic Theory", "text": "Lately I've been having a fascination with political systems and theories but there is one aspect I can't wrap my head around; \n\n**How/where is a nation's money/currency created?**\n\nWhen I was younger I've read both Das Kapital and The Wealth of Nations. Lately I've been attempting to read about Keynesian Economics, fractional-reserve banking, monetary policies, how central banks use interest rates to control inflation/deflation.\n\nI can't get to the \"core\" of the issue though, I just don't seem to fully understand it. Maybe I need a 5-year economic degree to really understand it but I'm hoping an economical genius here can give me a \"crash course\"?\n\nI do understand it in the physical sense; the government has printing machines that makes money. Banks get some of these money and it's distributed to people and corporations.\n\n**What I don't understand is more practical.**\n\n**Example 1:** Say I work at a lumber mill. I do a job, the company pays me. The company gets their money from selling lumber to another company. This company is a mining company, they use the lumber to make supports in their mines. They pay their workers. Their money comes from selling bauxite to a foreign company. This money comes from another country's economy - that company pays workers with money they get either from selling something or from their government. This money again comes from taxes in some way or another.\n\n**Example 2:** I work at an IT support company. I get payed by my company. The company has a contract with the government to support and deliver IT infrastructure. The government agency gets their money from the national budget which is funded by taxes. Those taxes comes from workers which gets their money from their pay which comes from where?\n\n**Is the government (which is the people) essentially just \"leeching\" off itself in an endless circle? What is the \"point of origin\", where does it stop?**\n\nThen there is another huge issue which just confuses me even more: fractional-reserve banking. As far as I understand this is widespread in most westernized countries today. My understanding is that banks can \"reuse\" the same physical cash to give out many loans. Which essentially means they \"create\" digital money without physical currency? Is this just some elaborate \"legitimized\" scam?\n\n**This chain of thought started because I was thinking about Universal Basic Income.**\n\nI was thinking to myself; so how would a country get the money required for a UBI? I guess taxes, but could they not just \"print\" the money? But if you print the money couldn't you just create some utopian nation where every citizen gets a billion dollars/pounds/kroner per year and everyone is rich? Then I was starting to think why this can't work, and hence it led me to my current state of my brain hurting from thinking too much...\n\nEssentially is UBI just taking money from some people or some corporations to give money to all citizens?", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "created_utc": 1490954029.0, "tickers": []}

Thanks in advance! \n\nSo I'm renting out on airbnb and one conundrum struck me today that you guys probably have no problems answering.\n\nThe idea is that I rent out the whole house plus 1 bed for one person for a cost of $50. \n\nThen, for every additional guest it costs $10, because the expenses are the same no matter how many visitors we have (not entirely true, see next paragraph). \n\nNow the problem is that it's way cheaper for groups to book all the rooms than it is for one person or couples. And the largest groups will raise the expenses a little bit. \n\nSo I have no problem to rent out to groups, but I don't want the statistics to get lopsided towards groups as there are more expenses over time. \n\nSo the question is: How do I price it so that any number of guests isn't significantly a better choice than any other? Is there a formula for what I'm proposing? airbnb allows me only to set one base price + one price for additionals, or else I'd just find a curve.\n\n----\n\nHere's some details for anyone interested or confused by my post. \n\nI have a big house, and I put three of the bedrooms + access to all of the house on airbnb. The rationale is that it should be cheap enough for one person to go here, and attractive for families as well. The reason I want families or groups as well is that the net profit is bigger while the expenses only grows a bit (there's also the wear and tear etc). \n\nBasically I wish for any group from one to six people to evenly book a room. So assuming every guest do the old \"divide total by how many we are\" would arrive at the same or near same price/incentive. \n\nI see that a single guest will pay more, but that's just how it is seeing as I pay almost the same for expenses (laundry is the same price if it's just the laundry of one or six, cleaning is the same). It pays off to be two or more, that's fine because it pays off for me too, but right now the cheapest alternative is to be at maximum beds which suddenly negates my profit. \n\n*sigh*\n\nI know this is a wall of text, but it goes beyond the high school math I had...\n\nAnd reddit gold for the answer that helps me out, if that makes any difference to you.

{"name": "t3_6kx0rb", "title": "Who Would Win - Universal Basic Income vs Universal Basic Math", "text": "**hint: it's math**\n\nSo there are about 325 million people in the United States. Just to keep the math simple, let's call that 300 million. What would a good UBI be? Call it $10k? Well that's $3 trillion dollars. \n\nFor those who don't keep track of such things, the total [federal budget](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/federal-receipt-and-outlay-summary) is about $3.7 trillion. Not including Social Security and Medicare, $700 billion is spent on [Welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States#Congressional_funding). So, you'd increase the federal budget to $6 trillion. That's a 62% increase. \n\nThat money has to come from somewhere. And even if you increased federal tax revenues by 62%, you'd still be increasing the federal deficit because [revenues are currently less than expenditures](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/federal-receipt-and-outlay-summary). So to stay deficit neutral, you'd have to increase federal taxes by 71%.\n\nSo clearly $10k per person is too much. So let's make it $5k. Well, that's a little more realistic. It's *only* $1.5 trillion. Once again deducting the savings of $700 billion and you're *only* adding $800 billion to expenditures. (To put that in perspective, free college would cost something like $200 billion.)\n\nSee, here's the problem: There are about [100 million Americans](http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/terence-p-jeffrey/354-percent-109631000-welfare) currently on Federal Welfare (not counting SS or Medicare). They currently receive about $700 billion in aid. So that comes out to about $7k per person. Even if we say, what the hell, $50 billion of that is spent on government overhead, which is crazy when you consider [education is $70 billion](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/), but what the hell, I'll give you $50 billion in government overhead. That just knocks it down to $650 billion spread over 100 million which comes out to $6.5k per person. Still more than the $5k UBI. And $800 billion less expensive.\n\nSo here, let me some this up nicely for you: UBI would increase taxes dramatically and cut benefits to the poor. \n\nIf there's something I'm missing, be sure to let me know in the comments --as rudely as humanly possible Im sure-- so I can correct my post.

{"name": "t3_6veqr0", "title": "New economic downturn?", "text": "First off, I am not an economist (I'm an engineering consultant who happens to invest a lot). There, I've said it. I'll also say that economists have a pretty awful record when it comes to predicting economic downturns.\nI'm starting to feel a little uneasy about the UK economy for several reasons (not just Brexit) and have carried out some research. Some of this research has lead me to believe that even worse problems are appearing in the US and China as well.\n\nMy reasons:\nA few large housing construction clients have recently started delaying payments to My company (and others) and have even written this into all new contracts. Looking at the financial statements of these companies has shown that they hold a disproportionate amount of property in London. A potentially related issue is that house prices in London have stalled (and reversed in some areas). A deeper look at the UK economy shows that the UK House price / earnings ratio is currently 5.73%, a 2nd only to the all time high in mid 2007 (that date sounds familiar). \n\nQuick research:\nI then looked at UK personal debt and you guessed it, currently running at an almost all time high of 126% of income. Therefore it is not unexpected to find that consumer spending is almost £60,000,000,000 more than the consumer disposable income. Personal savings are currently 1.7% and have dropped significantly since last May (possibly to cover gap between disposable income and spending).\n\nBefore I lose every bodies attention by spouting numbers, I should note some of the reasons behind the 2007/2008 recession:\n\n-Low interest rates meaning more people believing they can afford homes out of their reach\n\n-Government backed mortgage schemes\n\n-Lax regulation of lending\n\nIt is worth noting that in the UK at least, these are all true. Low interest rates are leading to high inflation and must rise eventually. The government ‘help to buy’ scheme has increased the potential for risky lending. The regulations for lenders are much firmer than in 2007, but in the last budget some of this was reversed.\nI have not considered other countries in as much detail, but have noticed the US housing market has effectively stalled (I’m not sure about the historical performance of this and should look at it again in the future). China’s economic data has been taking a downward turn for many years, which is a bad sign, especially as its debt to GDP ratio is increasing fast.\n\nWhen will it happen?\nLarge economic downturns are often caused by a bubble in a market (i.e. housing, fad companies etc). A few potential hazard areas to look out for could be:\n\n- Car finance market is vastly overpriced and could burst at any time\n\n- housing market (again)\n\n- tech company bubble. Are facebook, twitter, etc worth anything (never mind the Billions they are listed as)?\n\n-credit / storecard lenders. It’s worth noting that Provident are massively struggling at the moment and might well go under (caused by unrelated circumstances, but may be a trigger).\n\nAs I said this is just my interpretation of the data and I may be finding correlation that is not relevant. If anyone has a better insight into this, or knows more about economics than I do, I’d be happy to hear your opinion.\n\n", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1503442233.0, "tickers": [["FB", 1], ["TWTR", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_75eg18", "title": "Is Now the Time to Buy Bank Stocks?", "text": "The financials and small cap stocks have started to make new all-time highs once again. XLF, the SPDR financial sector ETF, has made new highs since its peak in 2007. Because of this, our newsletter portfolios are going to add more exposure to the sector. The Russell 2000 is also reaching new highs, but this is likely because of the correlation the index has to the financial sector. Currently the correlation sits at a 0.96 out of 1.00, and it generally stays above 0.50.\n\nThe correlation to financials is not a coincidence. First, the financial sector has the highest weighting in the index. Another reason is that the companies in the index, small cap stocks, often rely on financial relationships with the banks within the sector. It is often seen that the economy is as strong as its banks. In order for small cap stocks to do monetary transactions, they need to rely on America’s financial institutions. If they need financing or a line of credit, they go to a bank. Remember that correlation does not mean causation. Banks also rely on the smaller companies for revenue as well.\n\n\n\nSo, why are these two segments of the market making new highs?\n\nHope In Congress\n\nThe small cap stocks are likely making new highs because of political hopes. Since the Trump Administration released its tax plan, the markets are hoping that congress will be able to get tax reform done. It was a major promise of the Trump campaign, and it could really help the economy, but there are many investors that are waiting to see if anything will get passed before investing their cash. Since healthcare reform has failed to make any strides towards “repeal and replace”, and an infrastructure bill has not been passed, some investors caution that tax reform may be facing the same hurdles. If tax reform can get done, we may see stocks move up quickly, especially the small caps and financials.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nThe rise of the 10-year treasury note means that the financial companies can charge more to lend capital to individuals and companies. Mortgages, business loans, even credit cards become more profitable as the 10-year treasury moves up.\n\nThe interest rate for borrowing capital is determined first by the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate is usually the rate an investor can receive on a T-Bill (Treasury Bill). Interest is then added on to the borrower, based on the amount of risk the lender is taking. They will consider risks such as the amount of money borrowed, the time it takes to be paid back, and the borrower’s credit score.\n\nWhile the T-Bill is not completely risk free, it is considered risk-free because it is backed by the US government. Because the government can print money as it pleases, it is very hard to see a reason why it would not pay back its debt. The only reasons could be because congress fails to raise the debt ceiling and the government defaults on its obligations, or if the US government disappears. Of course, no one is expecting the US government to disappear anytime soon. Since defaulting is political suicide and highly irrational it is not likely the government will fail to make its payments either. The ramifications would be so large, and hurt the world economy, that it makes no sense to default.\n\nUnfortunately though, today the debt ceiling is used as a political weapon. In fact, because politics have made it hard on borrowers, credit rating agencies in 2011 downgraded the US from an “outstanding” borrower to an “excellent” borrower. This affects more than the US government though. Because the government needs to pay more interest, the risk-free rate has risen, making borrowers pay more as well.\n\nWhy Are Interest Rates Rising?\n\nInterest rates change for two reasons. The first is that the Federal Reserve can influence the treasury yields, causing the risk-free rate to change, thus changing the rates on other forms of borrowing. Secondly, bonds are traded just like stocks, but bond prices move inverse to interest rates. What does this mean? If an investor wants to buy a stock, they pay up to purchase it, and sell down to sell it. To buy a bond, the buyer pays a lower interest rate, raising the price of the bond, making it more enticing for the seller to sell. If an investor wants to sell a bond they must raise the rate to lower the price of the bond, in order to entice buyers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\n\nThe Fed has been raising rates on a path to normalization. After the financial crisis, the Fed needed to keep interest rates near zero. They did this because the economy was on the brink of a depression and it needed as much help as possible. In fact, they did more than just keep the Federal Funds rates low, they also started a program called quantitative easing (QE). This was a bond buying program which gave bonds and the bond market added demand, thus raising the money supply and lowering interest rates. Now, the Fed feels the economy is strong enough to withstand a more normal monetary policy, and they are slowly moving rates back up. First, they began to move rates up by raising the federal funds rate, which is one of their major monetary policy tools. It is the interest rate that banks charge other banks to lend cash overnight. The federal reserve raises this rate, and it in turn raises every other type of interest rate in the US financial markets.\n\nIn September, the Fed announced that it would begin to lower its balance sheet. The balance sheet is the amount of assets and liabilities the federal reserve has, and it rose to more than $4 trillion after the series of QE programs they ran. For a comparison, the Federal Reserve balance sheet was around $800 billion prior to QE. As they slowly start to lower their bond repurchases, they are inevitably creating more supply of bonds and less supply of money. This in turn, causes interest rates to move up.\n\nThe Bond Market\n\nThe bond market is also causing rates to rise because there is less demand for bonds. US Treasuries are bought and sold around the world. This is because they are still seen as the safest of the haven assets, and because they had a positive yield in a world of negative yields. However, as the international and emerging markets have started to grow again, haven assets are becoming less desirable. This adds supply to the market and raises interest rates as well. Take a look at the price action of the 10-year treasury yield: \n\nThe 10-year rose quickly after the election of Trump, but as his policies have yet to take place, they began to move back down. If the 10-year yield can make it past the 24 mark, interest rates may continue to rise until it reaches 26.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt seems the financial sector and small cap stocks are poised to start growing once again. The correlation between these assets is not a mystery. Both asset classes rely on a strong economy,and each other to be profitable. The proposed tax reform plans should also help both asset classes because of the effects it would have on the economy, and their balance sheets. A strong economy means a strong consumer. This should drive more sales, and more revenue. Also helping the financial sector is the rise of interest rates. As they increase, financial firms will bring in more revenue, and it will begin to normalize the economy.\n\nVisit www.brtechnicals.com/time-to-buy-banks-and-smallcaps/ to see full article, including charts!\n\nThanks for reading, and happy trading!", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1507606302.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_79sqvz", "title": "Unintended Consequences of Easy Monetary Policy", "text": "Easy monetary policy from global central banks has done a lot to help the global economy grow after the downturn of the Great Recession. Although the economy has continued to grow, it is not without consequence. This grand experiment that central banks have done is exactly that, an experiment. No one really knows what the consequences  will be with such a policy, and no one really knows when it is time to stop the experiment.\n\nThe monetary policy is simple to understand; keep interest rates low, and liquidity high. Interest rates are a tool that central banks have to either help boost an economy or slow it down. Typically, central banks will lower interest rates to help spur economic activity, while they raise them to slow it down.\n\nIn theory, lowering rates should help spur economic development because it makes it easier for people and companies to borrow money. They then use this cash for economic activity. Vice versa, if interest rates are raised, it makes borrowing costlier and thus slows down economic activity. Since the Great Recession was so drastic and harmful to the economy, interest rates were brought down to extremely low levels and for an extended period of time.\n\nNot only were interest rates lowered to unprecedented levels, quantitative easing was used to increase the money supply. Quantitative easing was another response to the damaged economy from the Great Recession. In order to decrease interest rates in bond markets, central banks began to purchase large quantities of bonds through the open market. This in turn lowered rates along the yield curve, and increased the money supply. With more money in the system, it increases the supply and lowers the cost of borrowing. This in turn should increase the demand for cash, using simple supply-and-demand theory.\n\nNow, all of this easing is bound to cause market reactions. For one, there is artificial demand created by central banks in the bond market. There is also a massive amount of liquidity in the market because of the large amount of money supply. And lastly, suppressing interest rates for such an extended amount of time can also pose a problem.\n\nArtificial Demand for Bonds\n\nArtificial demand for bonds means that the prices for bonds have raised, and investors have gained from it. With the central banks around the world inflating the asset, they are also drawing more demand for the asset because they know the central banks are helping the returns. It is like having insurance on your investments. In the beginning the Federal Reserve was basically guaranteeing that rates would go down, and your investment would rise in value. All of this demand for bonds pushed prices up, and made them more expensive.\n\nThis has also helped raise the prices of stocks that have higher dividend yields, and stocks that are linked to interest rates. For example, demand for utility stocks have grown and pushed up their valuation. When interest rates are low, utility companies have less costs associated with running their businesses and this helps grow their balance sheet. When interest rates are higher, they have more costs, and their balance sheet weakens. So as interest rates lower, the stock prices go up, but when they rise, the stock prices lower. Also, since these companies typically pay out a dividend, investors are looking to these companies to supplement the lack of income they are receiving from bonds.\n\nWhen the artificial demand goes away, it will inevitably lower bond prices, raise interest rates, and cause losses for bond holders. What is worrisome is that there are now products that guarantee daily liquidity for an illiquid asset. Bond ETFs can be a problem in a time of panic. Why might there be a panic in the bond market?\n\nA 30 plus year bond bull market may be coming to a halt. In 1981, the 10-year treasury rate was above 15%, and in July of 2016 the rate fell to 1.49%. Because of such a long market run, a lot of investors may not know how to handle a fall in their bond investments. With the inclusion of ETFs, investors can jump ship much easier than traditional bondholders, so they are more likely to do so. This will make their impact swift and painful, causing larger losses. Seeing large losses on bonds can make the other investors jump ship as well. As investors start to jump it will raise interest rates more and more until demand comes back.\n\nFor stocks, the higher interest rates are going to hurt the utility companies, and it will cause lower stock prices. The increased demand for dividends will also shrink because investors will eventually want to leave the higher risk asset class in stocks, and they will want to move back into fixed income.\n\nHigh Liquidity\n\nHigher liquidity has helped push all asset prices higher, stocks and bonds. When this liquidity starts to vanish, it should have the opposite effect, and prices should lower. This should mainly effect the bond market though since central banks are using it to add cash into the system. The stock market does have high valuations, but they are not inflated like the bond market. Sure, utility stocks will likely take a hit as well as inflated dividend stocks, but the strong economy makes an argument for the above average valuations in the rest of the market.\n\nSuppressed Interest Rates\n\nIn the Austrian school of economics, suppressed interest rates are seen as a terrible thing. The idea behind it is that since interest rates are so low, investors and companies are willing to take on more debt than they otherwise would. This in turn will cause bad investments because borrowers have such an easy supply of cash. Eventually these bad investments, which would not have been funded during a normal interest rate period, will fail and harm the economy in the long run. Now central banks say they are being careful, and do not necessarily see a lot of bad investments taking place. However, a look into auto-loans shows an eerily similar picture to the financial crisis.\n\nMillions of cars have been sold over the last few years. In fact, there have been record breaking sales numbers over this time period. However, when you look into the loans themselves, there are an alarmingly large number of investors that did not qualify for the loans. These sub-prime loans were the cause of the housing crisis, and now there is a buildup of them in the auto-loan sector. Sure, this time it may be different, for one cars are not as big of an asset as housing, but this does give some sense of how persistently low rates can lead to bad investments.\n\nThe Unintended Consequences\n\nIn the end, all we can really say is that interest rates are going to go back up. Unfortunately, we cannot claim that they will go up fast, slow, or somewhere in between, and we cannot predict exactly how policy normalization will affect the markets and the greater economy. Using our assumptions though, there are two main takeaways. One, bond investors are going to lose money as rates go up. This could cause panic, especially now that ETFs have become a factor. Two, utility stocks and dividend paying stocks are likely to take a hit from the rise of interest rates as well. Utility companies will lose profit from the rise of rates, and dividend paying stocks will falter because bonds will eventually look more attractive to income focused investors.\n\nOnly time will tell if the low interest rates will cause bad investments, but this experiment of easy money will be looked at for generations to come. Just like the Great Depression, the Great Recession will be looked at for its faults and its glories. Economists will look back at this time period and will decipher the causes and effects of all of the policies that have been implemented, and whether or not the outcomes were worth the risks. Just as the Federal Reserve and economists everywhere learned from the Great Depression, the Great Recession will hopefully prepare us for the next large economic downturn.\n\nThank you for reading, and happy trading!", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "created_utc": 1509416403.0, "tickers": []}

The socialists seem to think we dont need the rich but they fail to realise the reason we have most our technological products are due to the high risk high reward system we have. The capitialists seem to think that the system will look after itself and it will come to a natural medium. But this is not what happens. The people at the top pull up the ladder behind then to stop other from gaining in order to become super wealthy. \n\nIn order to stop this more regulation should be introduced to stop this happening. It would only take a small bit of legislation to improve the economies. One example i thought of is if all companies have to meet certain percentages of payments made to employees. ie. the bottom 90% of employees must be paid at least 50% of the total remuneration paid (ie wages, shares, bonuses, etc) to employees. So this would allow the lower wage employees share in the success/failure in a company. The employee would be paid his/her normal wage and would recieve a bonus at year end. This might mean a bonus of 5k at the end of the year and would allow each employee feel like they made an impact to the company (which they would have). This just stops huge bonus payments paid to the top few people. The top people still get substantially rewarded due to the work that they have done but are not overly compensated and all employees are rewarded.\n\nThis would cause a huge multiplier affect in the economy and each person would feel more loyality to their company. This is just an example so I have not included all benefits or drawback this may have but I think it would have a huge effect. This would increase growth in the economy by 5% in its first year as money is now circulating around each local economy and not just the banks or financial institutions.\n\nI know this is not going to solve every problem but it will definately help. I know this system would need to be introduced in a nearly all countries for it to take full effect but we need to try something else. I know they may be problems with this method and I would like to recieve feedback and see what other regulation could be introduced to help the 90% not just the top 10%.", "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "created_utc": 1515773880.0, "tickers": []}

What is going on?", "text": "Here's some hard data I'll walk you through.\n\nhttps://www.dat.com/industry-trends/trendlines\n\nDAT is a loadboard - an online system for shippers listing loads and truckers picking them up.  These charts show how many loads there are needing trucks.  The number of loads needing to be moved compared to truck availability is WAY up - 138% over this time last year for dryvan.\n\nA dryvan trailer is a big empty plain box.  Reefer looks similar and can haul most dryvan loads, but it has a refrigeration unit up front and it's own fuel tank underneath, plus it's insulated.  A reefer trailer can do food and medicine in addition to whatever normal \"dry goods\" would for in a dryvan...however a reefer trailer weighs 5,000lbs more so done heavy dryvan loads don't work with a reefer trailer.\n\nFlatbed means a flat trailer with no walls that you strap shit to.  They're somewhat tied to the construction business.\n\nAs the number of loads available for each truck climbs, so does the price.  Right now we're seeing rates in some cases up over $4/mile in dryvan, which is fantastic if you're a trucker being paid a percentage of the load rate :).  Reefer hasn't climbed as much but once produce starts moving come mid-spring or so expect those to climb and dryvan as well as reefers stop competing with dryvan loads.\n\nThe prices for shipping started to climb in August but we expected it to drop again like usual.  *It didn't drop much through the holidays* and now come Jan/Feb 2018 prices are still up and trending up even more.\n\nThe market for cheap used trucks with nearly a million miles on them are climbing.  This used to be worth about $10k this time last year, now they're running $15k plus as individual truckers snatch them up hoping to pay for them in a matter of two months or less - if they last any longer we're talking major bank.

{"name": "t3_7vl028", "title": "People are talking about a recession more now. Here are some potential triggers.", "text": "Recessions don't happen for no reason, it's a domino effect of one bad thing triggering another. I'm not an economist, but here are my wild speculations of the \"dominoes\" that could fall during the next recession.\n\n\n**Finance and macroeconomic trends**\n\n    The Federal Reserve is stuck between a rock and a hard place\n*If the fed keeps rates low...*\nIf they keep rates low, inflation will happen under current economic conditions. This would hurt anyone with bonds or cash.  It would also limit choices the fed could take to mitigate a recession.\n\n*If the fed raises rates...*\nIf interest rates are raised, businesses will have to cope with a more expensive money supply for the first time in a decade. Banks would reduce lending causing businesses that depend on short-terms loans could go bankrupt… like retail which is already in bad shape.\n\n    Full employment\n\nWhen full employment is reached, the rate at which the market can grow is hindered because the labor pool is not large enough to achieve optimum growth. Labor becomes more expensive, particularly hurting companies with lots of employees or thin margins. \n\n    Dwindling savings among consumers\n\nOverbought markets and dwindling savings indicate the end of an expansion and consumer inability to cope with a downturn.\n\n    Immigration uncertainty \n\nWhile unlikely, a sudden exodus of millions of people would have a great effect on macroeconomic trends. It could cause a supply shock in the housing market with millions of new homes (rented or not) on the market. Housing prices could drop causing some of the problems we saw during the 2008 financial crisis. Since we're already at full unemployment, the labor shortage would worsen causing necessary jobs to go unfilled.\n\n    Trade wars\n\nThe United States is highly dependent on global trade. If large-scale tariffs are imposed or long-standing trade deals break down with no replacement, it would undoubtedly cause massive imbalances in the economy and a sudden GDP contraction. If the US starts imposing tariffs, other countries will too. It could also be triggered by Chinese sanctions if the US launches a preemptive strike against North Korea for whatever reason.\n\n    Government debt is a growing problem\n\n The gross national debt in the United States is now over 100% of the GDP. In the event of a recession, this limits non-painful options the government can take to mitigate the crisis. Defaulting on the debt or inflating the currency would cause massive capital flight out of the country and the dollar would lose its status as a global reserve currency. Government debt crises cause decade-long depressions, not a simple recession (Greece 2009-current, Japan 1991-2007, Venezuela 2012-current). This typically is not the cause of a downturn, but something that is triggered by a downturn.\n\n\n**Technology**\n\n    Smaller tech companies not worrying about profit\n\n A large percentage of tech companies aren't profitable, they're in business to get bought out.

In Canada, tax credits cost keeps increasing as politicians use it to attract voters. But like tax relief in UK and U.S. it does not really help the people who need it the most. Not to mention the high cost of administration and bureaucracy.\n\nThis calculation was done back in 2015 and includes alternative budget and estimates of revenue from flat tax via income tax. Since then proponents of BI have called for Land Value Tax and other common resources royalty as revenue source instead of income tax. \n\nThe calculation shows how a negative income tax can easily be paid as well as a UBI based on the poverty measures per household.\n\nIt is still in draft state so the calculations and ideas still have to be reviewed and refined. But here are some summary/outline of contents:\n\nNegative Income Tax (NIT)\n\n* List of formula and variables used for calculating a Negative Income Tax (a mean test type of guaranteed income / basic income).\n* Table showing the gradual cutoff under various negative income tax rate. No welfare trap or penalty for working more.\n* $50.3 billion cost of NIT under a balanced 50% negative tax rate (using market based measures as poverty measures at 100%, i.e. zero poverty rate) - based on economist Simpson and Hum estimates.\n* $217.1 billion is the cost of Universal Basic Income (UBI) treated by household than individual, hence much lower cost than Universal Basic Income paid to each individual adult.\n\nBasic Income Amount\n\n* A sample budget of a single person and basic amount of $1,190 \n* Comparing it to Ontario's pilot amount of $1,390 per month for single person.\n* Comparison of current tax rate vs flat tax rate of 50% (below Nordic/Scandinavian countries rate) and show how low income earners are still better off, and $500,000 or $1 million income earners increased payment are relatively minor.\n\nAlternative Budget\n\n* 2010-2011 Federal Budget was used to create an alternative budget (with explanation of why that year's budget was used). \n* There are direct savings or funds that can be readily redirected from social transfer related to poverty to a basic income. ~ $80.70 billion.\n* At least $10 billion in administrative / bureaucracy savings.\n* ~ $29 billion savings from drastic reduction to poverty for province/territories.\n* ~ 15.5 billion savings for municipalities.\n* Total savings of ~ $135.45 billion without increasing taxes.\n* UBI would need strong collaboration from all levels of government to make it work efficiently.\n* NIT can be readily implemented now and using the savings identified above, there will be a surplus of ~ $37.39 billion (after free post secondary and Child's BI, which are already included and deducted)\n* With UBI (Simpson & Hum estimate), additional $121 billion of revenue would have to be raised. This can easily be done with a switch to flat tax. Although some UBI proponent calls for revenue to be taken from shared resources, land value tax, etc instead of income tax. \n* A non-expert estimate of a very simplistic UBI cost paid to all adults and how it is paid with a flat tax of 46%, currently the highest tax bracket rate for combined Fed and Provincial marginal tax rates (No one is worse off since non-taxed basic income received by everyone more than covers for increased tax rate. 46% is already the top end paid by higher income earners).\n* Under the very simplistic calculation and revenue from flat tax, a surplus of `$10 billion is possible. (this is after free post secondary education and improved UCCB s a Child's basic income. $5,000 per child for all families, above current UCCB of ~ $1,900 that is only applicable to poorest family)\n* Option for use of surplus towards National Pharmacare (which is estimated to cost $19.3 billion to $22.6 billion according to the Parliamentary Budget Office.\n* An alternative option is to set aside the $80 budgeted for transportation in the basic income payout to be pooled and goes toward municipalities infrastructure and free transportation plan. Yes, free transportation like one being proposed in some Germany's city right now can easily be paid through redirection of these funds.\n* Free post-secondary cost is ~ $13.5 billion while an effective UCCB to act as child's BI cost $28.5 billion\n* A very pessimistic estimate was also done with huge drop in worker's participation vs the likelier 15% seen in various past BI experiments. \n* List of alternative funding options, including Land Value Tax which is said to have complimenting effect of preventing landlord taking advantage of increased income of renters, to raise the rental rate.\n\nThe spreadsheet used for the calculation can be seen in the spreadsheet linked below. It is still in rough draft stage so there might still be errors and some parts (especially in the \"Scratch notes of thoughts\" worksheet) have sentence structure that probably still needs quite a bit of work. And dump of ideas that needs to be evaluated to see what is practical.\n\nFeel free to criticize and question assumptions and calculations.

And it can be printed by anyone with a 3D metal printer with the right fineness precious metal powder.\n\nGolden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen are 3-in-1 cryptocurrency that use the golden ratio (1.618...), the silver ratio (2.414...) and bronze ratio (3.303...) to simulate the supply of physical Gold, Silver and Copper. And where the standard weight (in grams of the cryptocurrency) of a coin unit is calculated at each block and change automatically so each coin always have the correct fineness (% fees) with the possibility to access and recieve any coin with one private key. And it's possible by a global consenus to back the value of the coins to the physical coins (for exemple 1 YEN = 1 REN). And the network will find by itself the best weight for the cryptocoins to satistfy the backing without the need of an centralized Supply/Demande exchange to calculate the value of the coins.\n\nY-Network, K-Network and J-Network are 3-in-1 Channel Factories build on top of Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen where anyone in the network can melt down their coins to grams and make instant 100% pure grams (zero fee) to any person in the network and at the end remint the grams to standard coins. And the network nodes are station unit called Zen Towers that offer the exchange of all the 9 types of money with providing cellular 5G/Wifi node. And with the offering of physical coin exchange will make the channel distributed around the earth with no centralized hubs/nodes.\n\nIn this monetary system, the do(Zen)al base is used for pricing good and services.

There is a possibility that Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen will fail at some point even with automatic block size (or density) adaptation and channel factories. So if there is an implementation of it in the actual architecture I will see it only as an \"Experiment\". It's a good thing because it will prepare us for the real implementation on the next generation machines.\n\nThe Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen need a machine/computer/smartphone/smarthing with pool of fast memristors base memory connecter with a photonic fiber to a pool of highly parralizable and specialized CPU that communicate with other similar peers with an external high bandwidth cellular base wireless communication.\n\nHewlett Packard Corporation have already made some research about this type of machine. For many years they havent give it a name yet, they call it only \"The Machine\". (I believe because it's my destiny to name it... just kidding HP! Dont take it seriously! Dont sue me! :P).\n\nI give it that type of machine the name of \"Nen\" the same name as the Human Enhancer Technology introduced by M. The decentralized and anonymous high speed cellular internet build on top of Nen including the 3 cryptocurrency the name of \"Zen\". And the decentralized and distributed Global Brain Machine build on top of Nen and Zen, where anyone can share their memories and CPU for grams in a Hashgraph like protocol and where anyone can do anything he can imagined like store or compute data, search, play, collaborate.

The reason why economics is not an exact science is because every economist is trying to predict human behavior. In fact, the number one thing you must learn, in order to understand economics, is an assumption. You must assume that the actor in the economic model is rational. So, how can we make precise models when we know that not everyone is completely rational? The answer is, we don't, and that is why there are a number of competing ideologies and philosophies within the study of economics.\n\nOne idea that sticks out to me, given the current conditions, is the Austrian School of Economics. These economists felt that too much liquidity, and easy access to capital results in higher risk taking, and malinvestments. The idea is that if it is easy to get capital, then individuals with capital are prone to taking on more risk, without doing the proper research and due diligence required to make a good decision. The incentive to make perfect investment decisions diminishes, if an investor or company only needs to get more capital to stay afloat. \n\nSince the Great Recession, we have had extremely low interest rates, and extremely high levels of liquidity. Investing conditions have never been easier, and I think this has a direct link to stock market performance, private investments, and alternative investments like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The rise of unicorn companies such as Uber, the high valuation of Tesla without profits, the FAANG trade, and the rise of cryptocurrencies can all be attributed to the ease of monetary conditions. And now, the punch bowl is going to be taken away.\n\nAs the Fed starts to raise interest rates and taper off its bond repurchases, liquidity is going to dry up. Markets as a whole, such as the stock market, and the bond market, are probably not in bubbles, but there are definitely bubbly assets. Stocks like AMZN with a 307 P/E ratio, and NFLX with a 206 P/E ratio are bubbles. How can any investor expect profitability to catch up with these share prices in the near future; a recession will come well before that. These stocks are priced for earnings 20-50 years from now, just like the internet bubble was, and I think they will have a similar fate.\n\nThanks for reading!\nVisit www.brtechnicals.com for more blogs", "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "created_utc": 1523232943.0, "tickers": [["AMZN", 1], ["NFLX", 1]]}

There's another key support level that could provide a clearer signal of market distress, according to Mike Dong, top financial analyst from FuninUSA.\n\nIf the market does decline further, the most important support level will be 2,581 on the S&P 500. That was the closing low on Feb. 8 and April 2. Any meaningful close below that level would raise a big red flag on the stock market over the near term.\n\nWhen support and resistance levels are broken, it tends to indicate that the buyers have run out of ammunition or sellers have run out of stock to sell. The asset then sees a major move once those levels are broken. \n\nAs Khan Tsai, another expert from FuninUSA stated, the other thing to watch is the lack of volume in the market. If you look at the \"double bottom\" that took place in 2015 and 2016, both lows were accompanied by a jump in volume. Getting that big jump in volume during the retest of lows told investors that some capitulation had taken place and that the market had finally become washed-out.\n\nThis time around, volume did not jump at all. In fact, it was very, very low. That suggests there is not enough fear in the marketplace to create a sustainable low right now.\n\nThe likely reason is that investors hope the earnings season will turn things around. If that's the case, they likely don't want to sell ahead of that.\n", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "created_utc": 1523445898.0, "tickers": []}

The 10-year note is used as a benchmark for many financial instruments, including mortgages and as a barometer of investor confidence.\n\n\nSo higher rates not only make equities less attractive, but they also signal that the economy is, or could be, at risk. If companies see their margins squeezed, they might be forced to pay less to employees, even lay-off people.\n\n\nThe particular effect of higher rates on mortgages also lowers people's ability to spend elsewhere.

{"name": "t3_96ujdt", "title": "Bitcoin Volume as a Bellwether to Unrest in Turkey", "text": "In the words of Confucius, “if you study the past, you define the future.” While this statement can be made applicable for many aspects of life, in none does it ring truer than political unrest and revolution. From protest in the streets to economic turmoil, political unrest (no matter where on earth you may find it) can shake the world’s socio-political and socio-economic pillars through and through. Furthermore, like the infamous Arab Spring and many other uprisings, political unrest and economic turmoil almost certainly lead to a change of power and regime. This sort of unrest can now be seen first-hand in many regions, however, it is the uprising in Turkey that should truly capture the eye of global governments and citizens alike, as it has quickly become a crucial turning point for the once theoretical concept of the use of Cryptocurrency as a state-wide currency, despite there already being a standard Fiat currency in Turkey – the Turkish Lira.\n\nFor over 15 years now, Turkey’s Erdogan has lead the nation with the Iron fist of dictatorship in both the Prime Minister (2013-2014) and Presidential (2014-Present) positions. In June of 2018, Erdogan won his latest re-election with a vote of 52.4%. Despite this number (and the election in general), has been called corrupt, unjust, or fixed by many within Turkey and around the world, Erdogan had continued to coral power throughout the region. Furthermore, although Erdogan may be extremely powerful within Turkey, his blatantly dictatorial actions have made him a pariah on the world stage and has led to super powers like the United States imposing harsh sanctions on the nation.\n\nWhile Erdogan’s poor leadership and dictatorial mindset can certainly be blamed for the current economic downfall of turkey – with the Turkish Lira losing value at a current rate of 3.3889-6.6870 Lira/USD in the past year alone – it can certainly be said that the sanctions (and warning of sanctions) by the United States has been far from helpful for the nation’s desperate population or chaotic state. Although such economic hardships and downturns almost never affect the elite / ruling class, the every-day-Joe Turkish citizen is suffering greatly under an abusive regime, a failing economy, and the restrictions that come with a 9.6% unemployment rate throughout the nation. Furthermore, while many citizens may want to protect their assets by investing in foreign currency as the Lira falls, Turkey’s Erdogan has recently called for all citizens to sell their foreign currencies in an effort to prop up the Turkish Lira – stating that the government will confiscate your money when we find it.”\n\nSo then, what might be the solution for the Turkish people? Their economy is failing, their nation is being hampered by international sanctions, and they’re living their lives under the thumb of an extremely oppressive regime, how might they help (or even save) themselves? Most Turkish citizens seem now to be turning toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for financial security and relief. This flood of cryptocurrency is not unique toward Turkey however, in fact, through analysis and comparisons of both cryptocurrency exchanges and Forex pairings, one may note the sudden influx of cryptocurrencies in places like the Korea, Poland, Russia and Turkey – which makes sense, as all of these places are seeing some level of unrest amongst their populations.\n\nIf seen as a store of value, rather than a viable money-making investment, (which, in reality, is what Bitcoin should be seen as and is), one might ask the question: “Why would people who feel safe / secure with their nation and its economy need to store their money in anything other than the currency of the country?” Furthermore, once the cross-examination of cryptocurrency markets and Forex markets are accompanied by news reports of injustice and civil unrest, it may become extremely clear what’s going on in these nations. Furthermore, this may be used in the future as an indicating factor for civil wars – as usually economic downturn turns the military on its leaders and a coup begins, especially if the people are on their side.\n\nWhile such links are, for now, theoretical, as time unravels the fate of Turkey’s current dictator, it’ll undoubtedly be extremely interesting to see how cryptocurrencies may continue to play a role in either the potential regime change or whatever else might come. After all, when looking for clues one should always “Follow the money”.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1534126863.0, "tickers": []}

The Ukrainian authorities affirm that this reform is the most efficient (or one of the most efficient) reform of recent years. They add that the efficiency of this reform has already been demonstrated in practice. The budget for the already established consolidated territorial communities (CTC) has increased significantly. The financial decentralization in Ukraine is, indeed, successful, for example, the budget for 2018 for the Berezovsky territorial community in the Odessa region exceeded UAH 61 million (it was UAH 23 million in 2017). Today the implementation of social programs and the improvement of infrastructure have become a reality thanks to the financial decentralization. \nOf course, not everything is as smooth as we would like. Well, yes, the territorial communities’ authorities distribute the budget but it is up to Kiev to determine the funding allocations for each consolidated territorial communities (CTC). So, formally “decentralized” Ukraine becomes more unitary. CTC leaders are forced to navigate, they seem like honest defenders of their communities while remaining loyal allies of Kiev’s officials. In fact, the prosperity of communities depends on Kiev’s subsidies and grants. \nThere is another weak controversial point. It’s the establishment of consolidated territorial communities (CTC). According to the reform, from 1.5 to 1.8 thousand communities are planned to be established in Ukraine by 2020. By the summer of 2018, nearly half of the plan is implemented, but is it possible to realize it within designated periods? The process seems to be delayed indefinitely. By enacting a law on “A voluntary consolidation of territorial communities” on 5 February 2015, the Verkhovna Rada actually itself signed up to it. It’s worth saying that some regional and district officials aren’t interested in this reform because they are scared of losing their job. They sometimes slow down the documents flow and mislead the population as to the real advantages of the communities’ establishment.  \nMoreover, agro-business representatives militate against this reform. The state land registry began to transfer lands outside built-up areas to consolidated territorial communities (CTC) on 1 February 2018. This process was started by the Ukrainian government. It ordered farmlands in public ownership should be transferred to community ownership of consolidated territorial communities (CTC). So, with the creation of consolidated territorial communities (CTC), the business connected with unaccounted lands can collapse. \nBut, despite all of the failures and shortcomings in carrying out this reform, it can’t be underestimated. The optimization of the management system is necessary for further development of the country in general and rural areas in particular.  \n", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1535111391.0, "tickers": []}

This causes exponential run-ups in price, until the price of whatever asset it is, reaches a high that is just \"too risky for investors\" and then the appreciation stops... At that point, investors decide to sell, but sadly, most of the demand for the asset was investors, so, when they all decide to sell, there is no one to buy, and the price plummets... When it gets low enough, investors will then begin to buy again, re-inflating the price, restarting \"The Investor Cycle\"...\n\nSo this is basically a \"boom-bust\" cycle, but mentioning the \"investor incentive\" in it all... And there's also the matter of \"trade volume\", but as I like to say \"available supply, vs demand\", for instance, when all of the investors decide to sell, there will be a LOT more supply available then demand, while, on the contrary, as the asset is appreciating, there is a lot LESS available, since all investors are holding onto it while the price is going up, which FURTHER increases how fast the asset appreciates, since a whole lot of people are competing for it, and there is a very little supply...\n\nHonestly, I identified this while trying to figure out what was really going on with Bitcoin last year, before throwing my money into it...

This is normal during troubled times, and we were beginning to see the same thing occurring in Turkey. However, Erdogan thisa number of weeks ago called for all Turkish citizens to sell their foreign currencies to prop up the Lira. This sort of a call is usually code for “we are going to confiscate your money when we find it” so you better sell it now, as well as a tacit admission that the Lira’s value is in serious trouble. Thus, the economy as well.\n\nIn my opinion due to the tacit threat of monetary confiscation we are now seeing a flight to bitcoin and this is also a clue to the unrest that Erdogan is dealing with. Why is this problematic? Since Turkey can’t confiscate currency that is online and untraceable. We can see the flight to Bitcoin by comparing Forex crosses against bitcoin volume.\n\nIn this light we can see a trend whereby that out of the top 8 Bitcoin traded countries/currency (USD, JPY, EURO, GBD, KRW, PLN, TRY, RUB/RUR) only 4 (USD, JPY, EURO and GBD) are in the top 8 Forex pairings. The others are minor currencies.\n\nThe Top 8 Forex crosses are:\n\nEUR/USD 37% of total volume\n\nUSD/JPY 13% of total volume\n\nGBD/USD 12% of total volume\n\nAUD/USD 6% of total volume\n\nUSD/CHF 5% of total volume\n\nUSD/CAD 4% of total volume\n\nEUR/JPY 2% of total volume\n\nEUR/CHF 2 % of total volume\n\nBased upon the comparison between the Bitcoin and Forex Volume we can conclude that there is a feeling of unrest in Korea, Poland, Russia and Turkey. Why put discretionary cash in bitcoin if you feel secure! Add to this the protests, negative economic indicators and international isolation and we can conclude that Turkey is ripe for unrest and the citizens wanting regime change. This does not mean that they will succeed as Erdogan controls the military. However, as we have seen in the past (example the revolution in Egypt) once the upper echelon of the army personally starts to feel the economic results of its leaders’ policies and the people start to demand change, the military almost always sides with the people for their own self-preservation and the betterment of the country they serve. \n", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "created_utc": 1537704374.0, "tickers": []}

The more I think about it, the more it makes sense to me. But maybe I haven't thought it out properly - so prove me wrong (or right)!\n\nHere's the thought: a free market is supposed to thrive because it's a hyper-competitive landscape. Good products thrive and sub-par products wither away and die because consumers decide to buy good products over bad products. \n\nBut advertising seems to throw a wrench in things. It's very possible for a sub-par product to do well because it's marketed well. People buy what they see advertised, not necessarily what is the best value for their money. It seems like advertising is specifically trying to diminish the competitive landscape that an efficient economy requires.\n\nFurther, the more a company advertises, the more they have to pay for advertisements. To recoup these costs, they have to raise the price of their products. This makes their products an even worse value. \n\nI imagine a simplified world where all companies advertise equally. What would be the point? All companies are spending a lot of money and have to raise their prices to pay for advertising, but no company gets an edge, because they're advertising equally. It's as if none of them are advertising, but they still need to raise prices. Surely this is an inefficient way for an economy to run. \n\nOn the other hand, I've heard the argument that if advertising increases sales, the marginal cost of making new products may be low enough to pay for the advertising (and then some) without raising prices. On the micro scale, this makes sense, but this also suggests that one large monopolistic company is the most efficient way to produce products (we all know this isn't true). And what if all companies are advertising? Then will advertising actually increase sales, or will all companies just steal sales from each other and net out somewhat equally?\n\nThen, there's the argument that advertisements are good for the economy because they spread information to consumers about what products are available. I agree that spreading information about products is important. But isn't there a better way to do it? The information from advertisements is necessarily (for the most part) biased towards one specific product. Many people prefer to get information from unbiased sources who rank various products, such as Consumer Reports, CNET, etc, etc. This provides information about products while actually increasing the competitiveness of the market. Maybe these sources are enough (or could be enough) to spread the information?\n\nSo help me out. Is there anything I'm missing? Has anyone else had similar ideas?

Nevertheless, dollar’s rollback does not help any other assets, and although the weakening of the dollar usually sets offs growth in the stock and commodity markets, this is not the case this time.\n\nOn the U.S stock markets, we see a continuous sell-off of stocks of high-tech companies. Nasdaq Index had lost 3% on Monday, and at the start of trading on Tuesday plummeted to lows seen back in May, subsequent to the decline of stocks of market giant such as Google, Amazon and Apple. Pressures on Apple shares have plummeted the company's capitalization by 16.5% since the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, Facebook lost 40% from its peak values in the middle of the year and sank to low levels, which we have not seen since February 2017.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPowell's words in regard to the potential pause in the rate hikes induces a pessimistic sentiment in the market participants about resilience of the economy.

The dataset showed that providers have huge cost discrepancies among the same medical procedures (>10x in some cases) and the professor mentioned that regional M&A of providers leads to monopolies, and that gives, a couple of rolled up hospitals in a rural area, say, huge leverage. There's probably some other secondary inefficient incentives that allow providers to be obscure with prices and bill more codes than are needed. Some growth is also expected from other reasons like inflation, increased obesity, and baby boomers. Also, M&A are also happening on the insurer side and leading to less competition (and higher prices, and easier price fixing). Generally, I speculate health insurance companies don't find a lot of price elasticity and don't want to cripple their provider networks too much. And even if it were elastic (that is, if it's too expensive, Americans become uninsured), the uninsured will just avoid preventative care and make their conditions worse, which may eventually lead to ER visits and more expensive treatments leading to bankruptcy, while the insured now subsidize the bill.  \n\nWhat's puzzling to me, however, is what the providers do with that additional money. **Where do most of the aforementioned monopoly rents go towards on the provider's side: doctors, g&a, or shareholders?**   \n\nShareholders: The healthcare sector substantially outperformed the general market over the past decades, but it the best fit polynomial line is much steeper when looking at premium increases (just from a quick glance).  \n\nDoctors: Of course, if one finds a cash cow, and the cash inflows scale with doctor-hours, and the demand for these doctor-hours increases (while the supply of doctor hours is fixed), one has to inevitably entice them with higher pay; it does seem unlikely that they would get the full pie, however - for there wouldn't be a point to the whole arbitrage game to begin with (get more doctors until marginal profitability approaches 0).  \n\nAdmin: That's what everyone keeps saying it is, but if that were truly the case, couldn't shareholders do something against executive management as they would be violating their fiduciary duty to shareholders? \n\n", "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1544766394.0, "tickers": []}

I'm reading \"Money Culture\" for the first time (I know... old book) and I ran across an interesting reference to [a paper written by Ben Bernanke and John Campbell back in 1988 titled \"Is There a Corporate Debt Crisis?\"](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1988/01/1988a_bpea_bernanke_campbell_friedman_summers.pdf) [PDF link]\n \nThe only reason the paper caught my eye was due to their references to \"equities repurchases\" (financed by debt, dividend reduced/eliminated and redirected CAPEX), in particular the observation of its overuse, 1984-1986, leading up to the crash of 1987.\n\nThe entire justification seems to revolve around the idea that buy-backs reducing float while dividend issuance does not.   Additionally, there are contributing factors of the time, namely high interest rates and debt tax advantage, that contribute to the assumption of debt for repurchases.  However, because debt-asset ratios are calculated at book value, there's seems to be an equity valuation blind-side. \n\nFundamentally, the conclusion of the paper seems to imply that significant changes in equity price can effectively mark to market mis-valued debt assumed for repurchases during an increasing interest rate environment. \n\nAccordingly, I'm curious if there is anyone doing any kind of publicly available analysis with regard to debt-asset ratios vs cash flow vs equity valuation.\n\nI'll just close with the reason I want to get a handle on debt service as a percentage of cash flow using a \"word byte\" from Money Culture:\n\n> debt servicing today comprises 26 percent of corporate America’s cash flow, compared with 22 percent in 1982 and 19 percent in 1974.

[LONG]", "text": "I know for the past couple of years the talk about government assisted programs have been a hot topic and now under the Trump Administration many think he’s trying to get rid of them. I just wanted to share my personal experience and my solution. \n\nMy mom and I moved to America in 2012, first thing she did was enrolled in college like we moved here in June and by August she started college. We lived with my grandfather at first and he didn’t support her going to college, was an alcoholic so he kicked us out in addition to other reason. So my mom was going to school full time studying biology, working nearly 30 hours a week and raising a 13 year old. She was lucky if she had two days in a week where she got more than 5 hours sleep in a night.\n\nObviously she still couldn’t afford all her bills so we were forced to have food stamp and Obamacare. One think that did stick with me was once we were shopping at the grocery one Christmas Eve and we bought lobster. It was probably our first time having anything lavish since moving to America but it was Christmas. A guy behind us in line saw we were laying with a food stamp card and went off on us saying how we’re taking advantage of the system saying we shouldn’t be having that, if we can’t pay with our own money. I was obviously embarrass and it didn’t help the fact I didn’t even get a present. Anyway I’m getting sidetracked but guy forever stuck in my head and when I was a senior trying to decide what to study in college that guy’s comment made me know what I wanted to do. \n\nFour years later my mom eventually graduated and got a job with the health department and another job working part time. As soon as we got settled financially she actually got off food stamp and obviously her job came with insurance. We were still eligible for food stamp I think even last year we were because they check income for two years ago. However, despite being eligible my mom decided to work a second job than munch of the government to get her bills paid. While in my community there were people living on government programs before we got to America and if I go back there now they are still probably on it. They stay home don’t work, with the hope of the government paying everything for them. To me that’s a problem, I’m disgusted by it look how hard my mom worked to get out of that situation but there are people who actually make no attempt to get out because it’s free. Honestly I don’t even blame them haha. \n\nNow I’m a second year Economics major and I just wanted to share what my solution is. Nothing outside the box haha, probably won’t cause a movement or anything but just wanted to share. I feel that government assisted programs should be federalized and not run by states then they should all be centralized into one program, because honestly if you need one your probably need the others. Now I feel these programs should also come with assistance finding a job or investing in human capitals. They can be encouraged to go to school where they can find a career. Now I’m not saying they should pay for school or anything but they should be helped with enrolling and I know some people might think that’s extra expenses but it’s gonna be cheaper than having people leeching of these programs forever. If school is not for them they can learn a trade, in many trades you get paid while learning. Or get some certification of some kind, get a CDL truck drivers are in high demand, a couple weeks you can have your CDL and if you can handle the road and willing to do overtime you can easily make 100K. If a person refuses to do these because maybe they have a degree but got laid, or just has another job in mine they should have a limit of how long they are giving assistance for.  If it’s obvious that they are making no efforts to get a job then take away these programs from them. I feel that a lot more people would stop staying home collecting welfare and become more productive members of society and the money spent on these programs can be spent in other programs. \n\nLike I said nothing too complicated but just wanted to share let me know what you think of it if there’s anything you disagree about.

When the company starts to make benefits and reinvests in itself to grow, this really has nothing to do with the initial investment and the CEO, and yet his wealth grows with these investments, meaning he ends up owning part of these successive reinvestments made by the company, which is a separate moral entity.

I've been mostly reading Bloomberg articles and researching terms and theories on investopedia.\n\nIn the last day or two there have been a lot of articles about the flood of investment into the bond market and the subsequent amount of negative yield government and corporate bonds. These articles say that it's due to the anticipation of the fed interest rate cuts coming up on July 31st.\n\nIf I've understood it correctly there's two linked reasons for this.\n\n1. In anticipation of low yield bonds being issued after the fed cuts rates, investors are buying current bonds with a higher interest rate.\n2. As the demand grows for these current bonds, prices rise and therefore yield drops since there is an inverse relationship between the two. If I've understood it correctly this relationship occurs because say if a current $100 bond with an interest rate of say 5% (so $5 a year) goes up to $110 then the interest rate will fall below 5% to match the $5 a year amount. Otherwise investors would just buy new $100, 5% bonds.\n\nBut my question is that if the fed is due to cut interest rates, why is money going into the bond market? From what I've read I've gained the understanding that generally as interest rates fall investments migrate from bond markets to the stock market, because A) corporations are likely to increase productivity in lower interest rate environments and B) new bonds will have a lower yield.\n\nWhere am I going wrong in my thinking? I appreciate I've read a lot about general trends and there are lots of subtleties. For example perhaps investors aren't looking at the stock market too much due to the current trade wars. Or perhaps this whole negative bond yield situation is a stepping stone to a migration of investment from bonds to stock. Or perhaps the stock market is already priced for the upcoming fed cuts.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read, sorry it's a bit long.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1563298403.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_cmhe7e", "title": "View: Few economic issues that need immediate attention", "text": "Now that elections are over, no one in the ruling dispensation needs to pretend that the economy has not been in dire doldrums for quite some time. There are many severe problems the economy faces, some requiring immediate attention, others more structured long-term policy changes. Of the former, I’ll pick two. \n\nFirst off, is the continuing scourge of demand deficiency (and the resultant low capacity utilisation) that discourages private investment. More than tinkering with tax concessions or interest rates, one needs pumppriming public investment on a large scale. The lack of investment is associated with lack of non-farm jobs and massive underemployment and unemployment, particularly among our restless youth (providing the foot soldiers of gangster-politicians and lynch-mobs). \n\nSo, the public investment has to be job-creating — in construction, roads, public housing, warehouses, cold storage, etc. In rural areas, demand has to be boosted through more such construction programmes and by expanding the scale of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) schemes. It’s not really ‘employment guarantee’, as evidence suggests that there is a large unmet demand for such jobs in many states. \n\nEvidence also suggests that leakages in the original programme have now diminished substantially. This rural programme now needs to be supplemented by an urban employment guarantee on public works and civic programmes improving our crumbling urban infrastructure. \n\nSo, where will the money come from, at a time when fiscal deficit is rising? With relatively low inflation, we may afford to relax a bit on the fiscal deficit goals if money is productively spent on income-boosting construction and capital projects. Besides, India’s tax-GDP ratio has remained low and stagnant even after decades of high growth, while wealth inequality (as measured by National Sample Survey (NSS) data) has now mounted to almost South American levels. \n\nA large-scale reform of our current subsidies (much of which are enjoyed by the rich and middle-classes), and increase in direct taxes (with current under-taxation of property values and capital gains and zero-taxation of wealth, inheritance and agricultural incomes) can be carried out at a relatively short notice. \n\nThe other looming problem we can’t look away from any more is the water crisis — for both drinking water and irrigation in large parts of water-depleted and ecologically stressed India. Along with immediate and drastic reduction of power and water subsidies, mass mobilisation of decentralised water-user associations in water management and rainfall harvesting is imperative. \n\nOf the more long-run policy issues, let me flag only a few. Our whole secondary education system has to be largely restructured and channelled to a mass-scale vocational training programme, in partnership with private employers. \n\nOtherwise, many jobseekers will remain unemployable. In view of our dismal export performance — at a time when Vietnam is picking up the sectors China is graduating from — and the slump in our job-creating automobile and ancillary sectors, renewed efforts at a coordinated industrial policy, particularly in financing and supportive regulatory environment, are urgent. \n\nIn agriculture, where there is a large potential for job-creation in high-valued produce like fruit, vegetables and livestock products, what is needed, apart from investment in rural infrastructure, is opening up all marketing channels, thus disabling the current cartelised markets, and facilitating the widespread formation of farm companies and cooperatives to stem the adverse effects of declining land size. \n\nThe largely wasteful and iniquitous current minimum support price (MSP) policy should be oriented mainly toward millet crops and pulses. All this will require political courage. But that should not be beyond the capacity of our current muscular leadership. \n\nIn a country with one of the world’s largest disease burdens, GoI is pushing Ayushman Bharat, an underfunded and hyped programme of insurance for hospital indoor expenditure for the poor. \n\nIn general, India has yet to debate seriously at the political level why a subsidised private insurance model to cover only about 40% of the population — and that too not for their more substantial expenses on drugs and outdoor visits —is to be preferred to other models of universal healthcare with larger risk pools bringing down costs (as, say, in Thailand or Australia). \n\nA large number of Indians, even far above the poverty line, face all kinds of brutal weather, health or market-related risks in life. \n\nTo provide some minimum economic security against such risks — apart from boosting the autonomy of women in the family and the fallback option of all informal workers — unconditional basic income supplement for everybody, far beyond PM-KISAN for farmers, should be implemented in phases. \n\nFinally, administratively, we are retreating from effective decentralisation needed for successful economic policy in a large diverse country. Power remains over-concentrated in the PMO, choking decision points, while Bills impinging on state powers are hurriedly passed in Parliament without consulting the states. All this is making a mockery of the oft-repeated rhetoric of ‘cooperative federalism’. \n\nPolitical loyalty and seniority, rather than performance, dictate promotion of bureaucrats, and public sector enterprises and regulatory bodies for private sector operations remain ‘independent’ only on paper.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1565041053.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_cqgy1x", "title": "The low interest rate has me worried about all the recession talk lately if things stay true to recent-ish history.", "text": "Let me preface this by saying I'm not an expert on this topic. I'm more a history guy but I think in this situation the history might matter quite a bit. Typically the Fed drops rates to help stimulate the economy in a recession but it's only at 2.25% right now which I think is a big problem if things go south like some people are predicting. For comparison here's some history.\n\nThe US first went partially off the gold standard, a.k.a. [The Bretton Woods System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) in 1971 because of lots of reasons that basically boiled down to the US not having enough gold to cover the dollars held by foreign institutions and what reserves we had were being depleted. (Whether you think this was a good or bad idea doesn't really matter in this discussion, only that it happened.) This started a whole series of reactions around the world that soon lead to rapid inflation. Nixon made things worse with wage and price controls and by devaluing the dollar even more. \n\nThe Fed tried to stop this inflation by raising rates but it didn't really work and by the end of 73 the interest rate was over 10% but inflation was over 12%, the Oil Embargo was in full swing, and the country was in a recession. It was [stagflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation). The Fed continued to raise rates peaking at just under 13% in July without it helping the recession or slowing inflation so they changed policy and just went at the recession dropping the rate over 7% in less than a year to around 5.5% and the recession finally ended in March of 75. \n\nAt this point the country was smack dab in the middle of \"The Great Inflation\", the causes of which basically depend on which economist you happen to be listening to or reading at that moment but basically boil down to lots of people being shady, wrong, or both. So the rates went right back up to combat it to no avail. From 4.6% in Jan of 77 to 6.7% in Jan of 78 to 10% in Jan of 79 to eventually over 20%. This brought about a lot of rethinking in monetary policy and changes at the Fed but the modus operandi for dealing with a recession basically stayed the same.\n\nWhen a recession happened in Jan 1980, possibly caused in part by the changes at the Fed to combat inflation which included a drastic rate hike, the rate was at 14% it kept up for the next few months hitting almost 18% in April then being dropped drastically to 9% by July when the recession ended. Kind of. Rates started back up in Sept 80 and by Jan 81 they were over 19%. This coupled with the high inflation and jobless rate helped usher in a second longer recession that started in July 81. The rate immediately started to drop getting down to 9% by the end of the recession in Nov 82. A drop of 10%!\n\nRates stayed in the 9-11% range until 85 when they started to creep down. In 86 & 87 they stayed in the 6-7% range with a little drop after Black Monday but not much because, no recession. Then in 88 inflation crept up again and they raised rates a bit to the 9-10% range where they stayed until July 1990 when a bunch of things like the higher rate, the S&L scandal (A direct result of deregulation by Carter), the 86 Tax act, the Oil Price Shock that came from Iraq invading Kuwait, etc. came to a head. But mostly it was just caused by a slight downturn after a period of sustained growth. The rate was dropped from 8.15% in July to 6.12% when it officially ended in March of 1991. Unemployment stayed high though so it continued to drop until it hit 3% at the end of 93. \n\nThat's a drop of just over 5% for a relatively mild recession with some lingering unemployment issues.\n\nAt this point the economy was humming. Inflation was low, unemployment was low, so the fed started creeping the rate back up, to keep the economy steady. They stayed in 5-6% range for the rest of the 90's. In 2000 the fed announced a rate hike to try and calm the volatility of the stock market but it was only to the mid 6's when the tech bubble started bursting and had dropped to 5.31% when the recession officially started in March. By the official end of the recession itself in Nov 01 it was at 2% but the economy while not officially in a recession was still pretty bad so they kept dropping it until it bottomed at 1% in 2003. (The argument that this extended low rate, coupled with banking deregulation, helped cause the subprime mortgage crisis is also pertinent. As well as Bush's tax cuts.) \n\nThat's a rate drop of 5.5% for a mid ranged 7 month recession followed by a slower than average recovery.\n\nIt eventually got back up to 5.25% by 2006 when the housing bubble started to burst and had been dropped to 4.24% by the time the subprime mortgage crisis brought down the financial institutions and officially started the \"great recession\" in Dec 07. By the end of 2008 the rate had been dropped below .25% making it effectively zero. (During this time Dodd-Frank was passed to try and prevent a recession like this from happening again.) \n\nThat's a drop of just over 5% this time but only because it couldn't go any lower and it had to be kept there for the next *seven years.* \n\nThe economy was fully into it's recovery by 2015 so they started slowly raising the rate back up but by the start of 2017 it was only up to 1%. At this point the fed finally decided to start normalizing the rate with steady increases through the end of 2018. (In 2018 congress also decided to do some deregulating again by gutting parts of Dodd-Frank. They also passed the Trump tax cuts.) \n\nThe economy started to slow a bit, which was to be expected and probably needed to happen, even though this was exacerbated some by our increasingly erratic trade situation, but it was still going up. By the time the Fed rate hit 2.4% at the beginning of 2019, Trump did his freakout on the Fed and they decided to stop increases. Then, with the economy still increasing but also still showing signs of slowing the Fed decided to cut rates, according to Fed Chair Powell, \"to ensure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade tensions.\" \n\nSo there are a lot of signs recently that a recession might be on it's way. If/when it does happen, how much much will our already very low interest rates effect things? It seems to me like it's going to be a pretty big issue and it's going to make what happens, if it happens, worse than it should be. At least that's what I get from the history of these things.

{"name": "t3_cvl0zs", "title": "Design Patterns for Decentralization", "text": "Nature (evolution) has shown us beautiful design patterns for intelligent systems. One such intelligent system is the physical body of any species in the animal kingdom. An animal is centralized in that it has a central nervous system and central blood pump (heart) that supplies blood throughout the system.\nOn the other hand, we have recently understood that there is no central point of control in the animal brain. We now know that emergent intelligence is pretty much a decentralized thing: there are no central neurons in the same sense as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) in the digital computer. The brain is a fully distributed, decentralized system in which not one neuron (or even group of neurons) controls the system. Its intelligence is an emergent property of the system as a whole, in which each neuron has limited but wide-area input tentacles and both far and wide output coverage.\n\nDecentralize! has become the battlecry for the blockchain revolution. Let’s think about this for a moment …\nIn other words, nature has shown us beautiful and highly effective designs that have both centralized and decentralized characteristics. I think what nature is showing us is that there are parts of the system in which decentralization make sense and there are parts in which centralization make more sense. The decentralization/centralization question is not a system-wide issue; it is rather like a design pattern issue. You cannot have a system that is wholly decentralized; some parts of it must necessarily be centralized.\nIn the animal body, there are only two sub-systems that are centralized: command and feedback signals (nerves and the central nervous system) and blood supply. The brain itself is highly decentralized, as we have already noted. Throughout the animal body, outside of the input and output signal connections and cardiac sub-system, everything else is decentralized. We can go down to the cell level and see that each cell is a complex system that functions independently except as regards to energy distribution and waste disposal. When an invading foreign bacteria enters the system, the response is local (even though the effect can be global, as in a viral infection). Some groups of cells receive signals from the central nervous system (muscles). Sensor cells stimulate the input pathways to the brain.\nWe can think of an independent country or human society as a “system” with lots of sub-systems. We have determined that there are sub-systems that are better centralized (the military, for example) and sub-systems that are better decentralized (like mass media and business). We have tried different system designs for society. In the communist design we have centralized control of both mass media and business; in the capitalist system we have decentralized mass media and business. In either design, government must necessarily be both centralized and rigid.\nThe whole point here is this: a system cannot be wholly decentralized; otherwise, it’s not a system but total chaos. This is as true in blockchain system design as it is in societal system design. Therefore, the ideal is not a totally decentralized society; the ideal, rather, is a design that affords the most freedom and yet allows us all to advance to a better place.\nReferences:\nNiall Ferguson, “In Praise of Hierarchy”;\nCarlos C.

Eve Online has a complex market economy because all of the goods are made by players and sold by players on open markets, which are stations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online#Economy All NPC stations have a market and some player stations can have a market if that module is installed. Here are some places you can see the market live: https://www.evemarkethelper.net/, https://evemarketer.com/, https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore . On the market you can trade both raw goods and components up to and including finished products. Each of these fluctuate based on whatever players want to charge for the items. Here you can see the cost of a Stealth Bomber and each of these is an order to sell and on the bottom are the orders to buy. https://evemarketer.com/types/12032. You can change the orders every 5 minutes and change the price to go up or down, etc. The interesting thing is that you can buy Plex with real money, and then sell that on the market for in game currency. So that market is pretty active. Basically 1 billion ISK = $10USD. When I talk about prices below, people can buy something on our market for 5c and then up the price to 50c-1USD, and that is common.\n\n**Here is the setup**\n\nWe are in an alliance of several thousand people. We live outside of the normal area and maintain our own market. This market is only accessible by people in our alliance. Side note that spys can join our alliance and mess up the market as well. The movement of going from where we live to where the main market hubs are is considerable. So to stock our market we either have to 1. build it locally, 2. buy it at a market hub and have it shipped down, 3. find it out doing PVE activities. Our market has unreasonably higher prices on most items. So if you take the market hub price and add shipping, tax, effort .. that would be some random price. The price in our market is 1000s of % higher than that. This is not healthy because lots of the things that people need to buy on our market need to be bought quickly and that forces them to pay insanely high prices.\n\n**Here is the problem**\n\nSome players buy things on our market and then relist them back on our market for some random price that they want. They will buy all of said item, and then relist said item for 1000% of the original price. This may or may not be caught by someone who can actually fix the issue by having more of the item shipped down from a market hub and then putting them up for a slightly higher than previous price. The relister can then buy all of that item again and at to their personal stock, thus keeping the monopoly on the item and the price.\n\n**Here is my view**\n\nPeople who relist on our personal market are adding a \"personal tax\" to items and creating waves of effort by others to correct their greed. People who relist are leeches because there is no retribution on leadership's side. They just buy them all, change the price, and then if and when someone challenges their monopoly they can just lower their price again. The people who needed the items between those times must pay the exorbitant price that he set. I think this behavior causes people to NOT want to participate in the market and the price gouging causes several problems. Price gouging causes people to not buy items out of spite. It is a non-team way to play the game and try to help our alliance.\n\n**Here is my buddy's view**\n\nIf person A lists an item for profit and then person B buys all of the item and then relists them, everyone wins. Person A has made a profit and Person B has created opportunity to undercut him. So either person A can go buy more of said item and then list them for an undercut price or someone else can see the high prices and that person can ship in more items, thus creating more items on the market.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nOur market has allowed relisting for several years. Our market is not in a good place. Thousands of items are marked up extensively and this causes all sorts of fallout. Their aren't that many people relisting, because mainly its seen as bad teamplay and morally wrong. Neither me or my buddy are economists, but he keeps using all of these random macroeconomics theories and whatnot, I think its horse pucky.

Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax,\" wrote Smith.\n\n***\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html\n#How FedEx Cut Its Tax Bill to $0\n*By Jim Tankersley, Peter Eavis and Ben Casselman\nNov. 15, 2019*\n\nWASHINGTON — In the 2017 fiscal year, FedEx owed more than $1.5 billion in taxes. The next year, it owed nothing. What changed was the Trump administration’s tax cut — for which the company had lobbied hard.\n\nThe public face of its lobbying effort, which included a tax proposal of its own, was FedEx’s founder and chief executive, Frederick Smith, who repeatedly took to the airwaves to champion the power of tax cuts. “If you make the United States a better place to invest, there is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment,” he said on an August 2017 radio show hosted by Larry Kudlow, who is now chairman of the National Economic Council.\n\nFour months later, President Trump signed into law the $1.5 trillion tax cut that became his signature legislative achievement. FedEx reaped big savings, bringing its effective tax rate from 34 percent in fiscal year 2017 to less than zero in fiscal year 2018, meaning that, overall, the government technically owed it money. But it did not increase investment in new equipment and other assets in the fiscal year that followed, as Mr. Smith said businesses like his would.\n\nNearly two years after the tax law passed, the windfall to corporations like FedEx is becoming clear. A New York Times analysis of data compiled by Capital IQ shows no statistically meaningful relationship between the size of the tax cut that companies and industries received and the investments they made. If anything, the companies that received the biggest tax cuts increased their capital investment by less, on average, than companies that got smaller cuts.\n\nFedEx’s financial filings show that the law has so far saved it at least $1.6 billion. Its financial filings show it owed no taxes in the 2018 fiscal year overall. Company officials said FedEx paid $2 billion in total federal income taxes over the past 10 years.\n\nAs for capital investments, the company spent less in the 2018 fiscal year than it had projected in December 2017, before the tax law passed. It spent even less in 2019. Much of its savings have gone to reward shareholders: FedEx spent more than $2 billion on stock buybacks and dividend increases in the 2019 fiscal year, up from $1.6 billion in 2018, and more than double the amount the company spent on buybacks and dividends in fiscal year 2017.\n\nA spokesman said it was unfair to judge the effect of the tax cuts on investment by looking at year-to-year changes in the company’s capital spending plans.\n\n“FedEx invested billions in capital items eligible for accelerated depreciation and made large contributions to our employee pension plans,” the company said in a statement. “These factors have temporarily lowered our federal income tax, which was the law’s intention to help grow G.D.P., create jobs and increase wages.”\n\nFedEx’s use of its tax savings is representative of corporate America. Companies have already saved upward of $100 billion more on their taxes than analysts predicted when the law was passed. Companies that make up the S&P 500 index had an average effective tax rate of 18.1 percent in 2018, down from 25.9 percent in 2016, according to an analysis of securities filings. More than 200 of those companies saw their effective tax rates fall by 10 points or more. Nearly three dozen, including FedEx, saw their tax rates fall to zero or reported that tax authorities owed them money.\n\nFrom the first quarter of 2018, when the law fully took effect, companies have spent nearly three times as much on additional dividends and stock buybacks, which boost a company’s stock price and market value, than on increased investment.\n\n***\n\nhttps://about.van.fedex.com/newsroom/statement-from-frederick-w-smith-chairman-and-ceo-of-fedex-corporation/\n#Statement from Frederick W. Smith, Chairman and CEO of FedEx Corporation\n*November 17, 2019*\n\nThe New York Times published a distorted and factually incorrect story on the front page of the Sunday, November 17 edition concerning FedEx and our billions of dollars of tax payments and billions of dollars of investments in the U.S. economy.  Pertinent to this outrageous distortion of the truth is the fact that unlike FedEx, the New York Times paid **zero** federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of $111 million, and only $30 million in 2018 – 18% of their pretax book income.  Also in 2018 the New York Times cut their capital investments nearly in half to $57 million, which equates to a rounding error when compared to the $6 billion of capital that FedEx invested in the U.S. economy during that same year.\n\nI hereby challenge A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax.  The focus of the debate should be federal tax policy and the relative societal benefits of business investments and the enormous intended benefits to the United States economy, especially lower and middle class wage earners.\n\nI look forward to promptly hearing from Mr. Sulzberger and scheduling this open event to bring further public awareness of the facts related to these important issues.", "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "created_utc": 1574074772.0, "tickers": [["IQ", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_eabyjs", "title": "We Have A Problem", "text": " While reading some of Ray Dalio's posts on Long Term Debt Cycle, something ominous hit me. Donald Trump is following the long-term deleveraging campaign Ray Dalio prescribes. However, Donald trump is executing it for perverse reasons. The deleveraging phase is required when simply lowering interest rates has no more impact. So, the central bank must print money to stimulate the economy. But printing money does nothing except for those who have financial assets and credit they can use for borrowing. The government must act to increase spending in order to get the freshly printed money into productive use. Ray Dalio promotes this may prove successful when the income produced with the freshly printed money more than offsets the debt added.  The problem with Donald Trump's policies is we are not deleveraging. Worse than that, Donald Trump's actions are only marginally increasing income while at the same time continuing to increase debt.   Ray Dalio promotes the deleveraging phase to commence while businesses, banks, and people act to reduce their debt and agree that slow income growth is acceptable. \n\n Starting the deleveraging cycle while businesses, banks, and people still demand high income growth and high debt - at a time when asset values, debt levels, and incomes are not aligned, while growth has already been slow for many years - is asking for trouble. Asset values are illusory, being pumped up by ever more debt. This has no effect on equity.  But the problem is worse than a simple bubble. Because the government and central bank have started the deleveraging cycle before the economy is ready, central bank policies may prove useless when the economy does slow.   Why does Donald Trump do this? These actions make people and businesses feel wealthy. Donald trump takes credit. Donald Trump gets reelected. When the economy does fall apart, Donald Trump will blame everyone around him and claim only he can fix the problem. So, he asks for a third term i office.

{"name": "t3_ebb2rv", "title": "How to model money generation in a closed economic system?", "text": "Hello, fellow redditors;\n\nFor some time I've been living with this problem that I can't find the solution either by thinking about it nor looking online. By firstly known that I have absolutely no background in economic science knowledge, but a strong academic background in mathematical tools to understand such model. The thing is that a few years ago I tried to create a toy model by myself that didn't pursue the goal of being realistic at all but giving me some cool graphs and statistics to analyze for fun. So I'm going to describe briefly this model to, hopefully, give you guys an idea of what I'm thinking of.\n\nThis model in question had several goods forming a chain of production that eventually got bought by \"the people\". I don't remember the specifics of the chain but it could be that there are two goods (call them A and B) that can either be bought directly by the people or combined to form a more valuable good C that can be bought too by the people. The specifics of the rules that I came up to recreate this are of no importance to the problem here, let's just say that the \"factories\" that produced these goods could alter their amount production depending on the demand and the price also varies according to this. So in the end, there is a dynamical system where both supply (the factories directly change this) and the demand (the people can get out of money and stop buying something) vary as too does the price.\n\nThe problem is what follows: not everybody cand earn money at the same time. This is a zero-sum situation. If A, B and the people have benefits is in the expense of C, which is losing it. Being in my model the control of production tied to this benefits (they decrease if the factory loses money) it leads to immediate collapse of the system in little time so, in the end, the solution I came up was to introduce \"the government\" which had it own demand and just unlimited cash to pay for it. What I found out is that the system was pretty sensitive to the amount of cash introduced by the government. If too few the system collapsed anyway, but too much and the prices went up exponentially (literally).\n\nI understand that the introduction of money in the system is something that has to be modelled somehow. In the end, money is a representation of the value generated by the economy and in each step of the chain of production, this value is increased. But the question here is how to do it. I think that the government thing is a gross simplification of central banks emitting money but how can be measured the right quantity of money to be created and the best way to introduce it in a simple model like mine?\n\nI'd appreciate any help that is specific to enlight me in this problem, but also any read on the matter that you think could interest me. As I said I have no economic education so most of the times that I look something up I end up finding out that I just don't know the technical terms to look for it and I just find a generic explanation. What I look for is a mathematical model or at least something I can take simple equations from. For example, if I look for something like \"economic models\" I just find thins that talk about the played-out curves of supply and demand which are of absolutely no help to me. I know it must be a name to the model I try to recreate but I just don't know it...", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1576475669.0, "tickers": [["C", 1], ["B", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_eehwo2", "title": "Recession?", "text": "With the mainstream media screaming that a recession is imminent, let's have a look at how things could potentially pan out over the coming years and where we stand...\n\nA Markets Insider article in August looked at a study by the National Association for Business Economics, showing that 72% of the economists surveyed predicted that a recession would occur by the end of 2021.\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/next-recession-trump-survey-shows-most-economists-predict-downturn-2021-2019-8-1028456445](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/next-recession-trump-survey-shows-most-economists-predict-downturn-2021-2019-8-1028456445)\n\nThis followed news in August that the yield curve had inverted - this has correctly predicted every recession since the 60s.\n\nAre they correct?\n\nLet's paint a picture...\n\nFirst off, we can see that, after the 50% correction in the aftermath of the Great Recession in 08, the S&P 500 hit roughly 750 in the first half of 09.\n\nSince then, we have effectively seen the longest economic expansion in US history with massive rallies across the board and the S&P currently sitting well above 3000.\n\nThis is because we've had REAL economic growth and the stock market is representing that real world abundance AND record corporate debt (currently around $10 trillion) has been used by companies to invest in the real world economy.\n\nJUST KIDDING!\n\nWhat has *actually* happened since 08?\n\nSince 08, in response to the crisis in 08, the Fed has printed money.\n\nA LOT OF MONEY. This is known as quantitative easing. In total, give or take $3.8 trillion has been printed since 08.\n\nA couple of years back, in 2017, the Fed started to unwind its balance sheet (known as quantitative tightening).\n\nHowever, that changed in dramatic fashion this year, as the Repo crisis reared it's ugly head.\n\nBasically the Fed stepped in on an emergency (supposedly short term) basis due to a lack of liquidity in the market. However, some banks (unnamed for obvious reasons) were still struggling to find the cash they needed to hit their reserve ratios - this is a consequence of fractional reserve banking.\n\nVery recently, this has been ramped up even more, with another $425 billion being injected into the system before year-end.\n\nOf course, this is just an emergency measure for a few months since September, and *does not* constitute quantitative easing, even though the impact on the Fed's balance sheet is in effect the same (lol)...\n\nNow, enough of the Fed and Repos, let's look at corporate debt:\n\nSo, as I mentioned before, corporate debt is pretty high - nearly $10 trillion and 47% of the overall economy.\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12-1028731031](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12-1028731031)\n\nSome say that companies are using this record level of corporate debt to continue to finance the cash on their balance sheets necessary for stock buybacks, and not using this debt to invest in the REAL WORLD economy.\n\nHence, the vast amounts of cash corporations have had on their balance sheets has been holding up equity markets, with the **main demand for equities over the last decade coming from corporate stock buybacks**.\n\nSo, in essence, companies are using the extra cash on their balance sheets to buy their shares and keep them propped up, while recently there has been near record insider selling.\n\nCorporations are not using this extra debt to invest in the REAL world economy, they are instead using it to supplement stock buybacks.\n\nThe best thing is that while they continue with stock buybacks to keep the share price propped up, they are selling their personal shares in the business and lining the pockets with profits.\n\nThus, they personally position themselves defensively and hedge - such that when the recession hits in the next 1-2 years, retail and 401k investors take the main hit.\n\nThe insiders are already out - and of course the tax payers through FED hyperinflation will bail the dead company or economy out...\n\nThus, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.\n\nSome say this will lead to a major credit freeze soon, more quantitative easing and the banks will need MASSIVE capital injections along with potentially negative rates.\n\nThe bottom line is that one should be prepared.\n\nBearin' in mind (get it...) what I said before about the main demand for equities over the last decade coming from corporate stock buybacks, it is telling that in the **second quarter of 2019 we saw a** **significant decline**.\n\nSome say \"just ride the wave, the Fed is printing more, equities go up\".\n\nTo me, the risk/reward is not worthwhile here. Like I said, since 08, we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history and we've had a return of \\~360%. The only other period that had the same return (it was slightly higher actually) was the roaring 20s. We all know what happened after that! No, I am not being a doomer and saying we will have another Great Depression 😂\n\nHowever, what is interesting is that Central Banks played a large role in the 20s which lead to problems later down the line...\n\nSo, we have painted a clear picture - the writing is on the wall...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOywhOUZD04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOywhOUZD04)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBRAVE BROWSER: [https://brave.com/fin894](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=FOywhOUZD04&redir_token=HZPVFewQdyiVauLKedDD2RU12YF8MTU3NjYxMDU2OEAxNTc2NTI0MTY4&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbrave.com%2Ffin894&event=video_description)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1577089863.0, "tickers": [["REAL", 3]]}

{"name": "t3_ew5lln", "title": "The Cantillon Effect and Wealth Inequality", "text": "Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?\n\nWealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.\n\nThis rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.\n\nWhenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.\n\nWhen the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.\n\nAlso, those the very top are often diversified, so even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.\n\nThe redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.\n\n**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about**.\n\nIn accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.\n\nUnder modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.\n\nUnder this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.\n\nThis is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.\n\nIn a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.\n\nUnder central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.\n\nIn both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.\n\nThus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.\n\nFor instance, the financial sector contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.\n\nOne of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.\n\nIn a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited. In other words, the phenomenon of **asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.\n\nAsset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.\n\n1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.\n2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.\n3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.\n\nHence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.\n\nDespite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.\n\n**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1580391650.0, "tickers": []}

They have well over 18 thousand miles of high-speed rail, which is more than the entire world has combined. Despite this, in 2008, it only had a few miles.\n\nThe Chinese can build a hospital in 10 days and, in 2004, China had just 21,300 miles of expressway; the number quadrupled of the current expressway system had about 80,000 miles. But, it wasn't always like this.\n\n  In 1949, after the end of World War 2, under the rule of Mao Zedong, the People's republic of China was created. He adopted the Soviet Model and for 30 years, China had a devastating period. He launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1957, which persecuted at least 550,000 people, most of whom were intellectuals and dissidents. From 1958 to 1962 he starved between 20 and 60 million people. China was mostly a rural country in which the economy was based on agriculture. It was so poor, that more than 88% of the people were living with just under $2 a day. Its economy was only about 5% of the United States at the time and was almost equal to Zambia's GDP.\n\n  Between 1948 and 1979, The Chinese economy grew at a very small rate, about 4 to 6%, remaining one of the poorest countries in the world, having a GDP of 60 billion dollars. In comparison, as of March 2019, 8 people had a net worth bigger than the entire wealth of China. This slow growth was due to maintained policies that kept the economy very poor, stagnant, centrally controlled, vastly inefficient, and relatively isolated from the global economy. A large share of the country’s economic output was directed and controlled by the state, which set production goals, controlled prices, and allocated resources throughout most of the economy. During the 1950s, if you had a household farm it would have been collectivized into large communes. You would still be able to grow your own crops, but the prices were set by the Chinese state. By 1978, about 800 million people lived in poverty and people were not happy about it. But, one day, on the 9th of September 1976, Chairman Mao Zedong died and an era ended.\n\n  In 1978, the Chinese government decided to break with its Soviet-style economic policies by gradually reforming the economy according to free-market principles and opening up trade and investment with the West, in the hope that this would significantly increase economic growth and raise living standards.\n\n   The first economic reforms were launched it 1979. The central government initiated price and ownership incentives for farmers, which enabled them to sell a portion of their crops on the free market. This meant that the farmers could finally set their own prices.\n\nAlso, the government established four special economic zones along the coast to attract foreign investment, boost exports, and importing high technology products into China. And companies came because people asked for low wages compared to the United States or other western countries. Economic control of various enterprises was given to provincial and local governments, which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free-market principles, rather than under the direction and guidance of state planning. Besides, citizens were encouraged to start their own businesses. Additional coastal regions and cities were designated as open cities and development zones, which allowed them to experiment with free-market reforms and to offer tax and trade incentives to attract foreign investment. In 1984, China further opened 14 coastal cities to overseas investment, including Shanghai, which shanghai stock exchange is located after it was reopened in December 1990.\n\n   Since the introduction of economic reforms, China’s economy has grown substantially faster than during the pre-reform period, and, for the most part, has avoided major economic disruptions.10 From 1979 to 2018, China’s annual real GDP averaged 9.5%. This has meant that on average China has been able to double the size of its economy in real terms every eight years and, China’s added GDP in 2018 exceeded the value of Australia’s total output, although China’s economic growth rate slowed to the lowest level in 28 years.\n\n   So, how did China's economy skyrocketed? Economists generally attribute much of China’s rapid economic growth to two main factors: large-scale capital investment, financed by large domestic savings and foreign investment and rapid productivity growth. These two factors appear to have gone together hand in hand. China is the biggest exporter in the world, as many of the objects right now in your home are made in china like Your iPhone, your computer and some of your clothes.\n\nEven if China has the second-biggest economy in the world, the average wage per person per year is about $19.000, having similar GDP per capita to the Dominican republic or Gabon. It is still an increase because China's poverty rate fell from 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015.\n\n As China’s economy has matured, its real GDP growth has slowed significantly, from 14.2% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2018, and that growth is projected by the International Monetary Fund to fall to 5.5% by 2024. The Chinese government has indicated its desire to move away from its current economic model of fast growth at any cost to more “smart” economic growth, which seeks to reduce reliance on energy-intensive and high-polluting industries and rely more on high technology, green energy, and services. This fast-growing economy of China had massive consequences on the environment. The air in the big cities of China is one of the most polluted in the whole world, covered by smog, which brings many problems to citizens' health. hand.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1582646917.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_f9s9xo", "title": "China, Poverty, and Practical Ethical Sourcing", "text": "Discussions of ethical sourcing tend to be very narrow, which is a problem because *the ethics of production sourcing operate very differently in the macro versus the micro*. On the micro, we obviously have a preference for sending business to factories that pay good wages, offer benefits, etc., but on the macro the competitive pricing of impoverished geographies with cheap labor attracts money that lifts entire populations out of poverty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Using 2011 PPP dollars, data sources at end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ebu0mi4je9j41.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3c585544bf58e0a0aeaa67dc9d6101c67435d74)\n\nTo illustrate this point, I’m going to walk through bare-bones of how farsighted policymakers in China and global demand (especially US demand) for cheap production from 1990–2014 combined to form *the largest movement of human beings out of poverty in history*. Then, I want to briefly discuss how to merge the macro and micro picture of sourcing ethics to form a framework that I think leaves two routes for companies to approach “practical ethical sourcing”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Macro Ethics: What China Did\n\nHere’s a very simplistic account of what happened with China since 1990. The competitive advantage of cheap labor and production allowed Chinese businesses to grow massively, selling to other countries who outsourced their production to Chinese factories. This created a positive trade balance (how much more a country exports than it imports), which meant a large positive “current account” for China (trade balance plus a few other metrics of income from other countries).\n\nGenerally speaking, this kind of competitive advantage erodes in two ways:\n\n1. **Your currency gets more expensive, which raises production costs in foreign currency terms.** This happens because exporters are selling goods in large quantities to foreign countries (let’s use US entities as the base case here). Those exporters get dollars for their goods, and then have to buy yuan with those dollars to pay production costs in China. *Basically this means a whole lot of dollars being sold to buy yuan, pushing the price of the yuan up.*\n2. **Wages rise.** This happens because export businesses see such good demand that they keep cropping up and keep hiring until all the cheap labor is basically hired, and then they start pricing the labor more competitively with each other and driving up labor costs (wages). *Basically more demand for workers in China means higher wages in China.*\n\nChinese policy makers knew this was going to happen, and thought “we don’t want a strong currency, we want a middle class,” so they began offsetting the upward pressure on the yuan by accumulating reserves — mostly dollar reserves. This meant that rather than being eroded through currency appreciation, the competitive advantage would be eroded through increasing wages (see “Appreciation Note” at end).\n\nSo how does this work? The Chinese government needs to sell a lot of yuan for dollars — enough to counter the buying pressure from all the export income being used to buy yuan.\n\nThe way this mechanically works is the Chinese government goes out and buys enough US government bonds to offset the the massive inflow. They sell yuan for dollars to buy US bonds, and the yuan stays flat against the dollar instead of rising. The Chinese government can make as much yuan as they want, so there’s no reason to bet that they’d run out of yuan to sell.\n\nYou’ll notice a few things in the chart below: the overall scale of both grows massively over the time period, and they grow roughly in line with each-other as reserve purchases offset the current account income. The reserve accumulation here is outpacing current account inflows in part because there are additional pressures to offset at times (foreign investment), and in part because I’m proxying it with an imperfect solution that will capture some appreciation of the reserves (see “Analytics Note” at end for explanations of this and some other important analytical choices like why this isn’t in GDP terms, etc.). You’ll also notice the picture gets a little messy in the post-crisis period, which makes sense as global demand constricted and capital flows got kind of wack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Data sources at the end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/35s1wv4le9j41.jpg?width=484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac80c67d5b7190969329f184d788780ac2723944)\n\nIn the early nineties, the Chinese government had unified the swap and official exchange rate, creating a 33% devaluation overnight, and then began to directly intervene in the currency’s value. Because the government was buying dollars (selling yuan) at the same rate that the exporters (and others) were buying yuan (selling dollars) the yuan avoided rapid appreciation. Instead, they allowed it to just make slow and steady gains over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Data sources at the end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0lwzjweme9j41.jpg?width=482&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2ad09caed8844ba17a8e233a9ef442d43723ee6)\n\nThe impact of this was that China retained a competitive advantage in the export market for longer than it otherwise would, and the advantage would only erode through rising wages. As continued demand for cheap production meant expansion of production facilities, new jobs, and demand for workers, wage competition took over and started to improve the income of Chinese workers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Data sources at the end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3i7miysne9j41.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=477b201ac9535f92512a711e599d5d71236caa01)\n\nThis wage increase means more money every month for a previously impoverished segment of the world population — a massive impact in terms of human well-being.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Using 2011 PPP dollars, data sources at end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/m7dhig9pe9j41.jpg?width=487&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c993f074c536f3a6bdd3a9a89ed1a1da08a585)\n\nNothing like that, on that sort of scale, has ever happened. But, things like that do happen on smaller scales in smaller countries all the time when competitive export pricing allows them to increase their wealth through global export markets and policymakers make good choices.\n\nIf you care about wealth inequality in a global sense, and about redistribution of wealth to poorer nations, then a lot of good is done by globalization of supply chains and demand for cheap labor (to the degree that this can ultimately translate to higher wages over time). Market dynamics distributing demand to geographies with cheap production can lift entire populations out of poverty. Today, the countries this most aptly applies to are the cohort of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc.\n\n*Does this justify human rights violations?*\n\nNo. It does not.\n\n*Were early industrial revolution coal mining towns that verged on slave labor “fair game” because they increased the wealth of the population over a few generations?*\n\nNo.\n\nThat macro picture is all well and good, but as individuals who are decision-makers on these things, we have our own moral obligation to maintain a threshold of ethical treatment regardless of the optimization of profits. Pay attention to what your factories do, of course, and don’t work with people who dehumanize their workers.\n\nThe take-away of the macro picture is just this:\n\n*Cheap isn’t evil. Evil is evil.*\n\nSo, how do we resolve this macro picture with obvious micro-ethical factors as we decide how to support better working conditions and avoid flagrant exploitation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Practical Ethical Sourcing and Where You Have Impact\n\nDespite the example above, you are not doing the world any particular positive good by choosing cheap factories. Unless you are in charge of manufacturing for a massive company that is a driver of the global market, your choices don’t move the needle on this dynamic. Whether or not you outsource your factory to a poorer country with cheaper labor, those large orders that do have an impact are driven by publicly traded companies whose decision makers, while [not actually legally bound](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/corporations-dont-have-to-maximize-profits) to maximize profitability, generally only have their job if they continue to do so. Demand will funnel to cheap production.\n\n*Does that mean that your choices have no impact at all?*\n\nNo not necessarily.\n\nTo synthesize: there are functionally two ways to run a good, impactful business with “Practical Ethical Sourcing”:\n\n**Version 1:** Go with a competitive production option, and make sure between comparably costed options you pick one that doesn’t have specific practices you find unacceptable (i.e. meets your threshold criteria for ethical practices). For example — refuse to work with factories that employ child labor (and make your own list of other practices you won’t tolerate). This is where *most* businesses who are primarily focused on product and producing value for customers, but also want to maintain ethical standards they are comfortable with, should operate. There is already pressure against most of the worst manufacturing processes, and by consciously avoiding giving evil factories your business you can participate in the process of “starving them out” of the global export market. You are having an impact through who you *don’t* give money to.\n\n**Version 2:** Give your production orders to someone so ethically focused and otherwise non-competitive that orders coming from you are a needle-mover on their probability of survival. To really work it has to be the primary focus of your business and brand, such that you can target your branding materials toward the audience who is willing to spend the premium to cover the additional cost of your “super-ethical” production (or else it isn’t sustainable as a business). The basis of the impact here relies on the fact that the factory is uncompetitive outside of a willingness to pay an ethical premium, so you probably need to be non-competitively priced for retail to maintain margins — which means finding the consumers willing to pay that premium. As an example: T-shirts made form recycled tired tires might not be the best Ts, or the cheapest, but you can make it your business to find the people willing to buy them and generate income for the people who make them. You are having an impact by who you *do* give money to.\n\nIt’s usually a problem if a business is falling somewhere in the spectrum between Version 1 and Version 2. They run the risk of either being\n\n1. **More about storytelling than impact** — maybe they advertise the fact that they produce in a high-wage geography (as though that is necessarily morally superior) or generally inflate the benefits of insignificant production choices (a lot of B Corps are like this; I’m considering writing an article about B Corps and how little that means), or\n2. **A bad business that won’t sustain itself, and therefore wont have lasting impact** — maybe they are trying to sell products with expensive, alternative, hyper-ethical production processes at competitive retail prices to the general market (possibly, in that case, funding a good brand and broken unit economics with VC money that will inevitably run out).\n\nAt [r/MeritStore](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeritStore/), we’re thinking through these problems in real time as we make sourcing decisions. For us, we think the best way is to set an ethical standard of practices we are unwilling to participate in, and then within those reasonable constraints source cost effective production. Looking at factories, we aren’t throwing out certain options simply because the wages there are low compared to the US.\n\nWe plan to make sure that we’re ethically comfortable with the factories we use to produce — for our own sake. We want to make a good business that brings great value to our consumers, and doesn’t compromise our ethics. I hope anyone interested in assessing the ethical promise of brands found value in this perspective, and I especially hope it is useful to anyone out there who is trying to navigate their own production sourcing decisions.\n\nI know that this perspective doesn’t harmonize with some of the ethical “ra-ra”ing around certain brands. I’m trying to think this through with data, basic principles, and an eye towards the practical realities of running a business. I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — \n\nIf you’re interested, come join the discussion at [r/MeritStore](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeritStore/)\n\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nData Sources:\n\n[https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/gdp-per-capita](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/gdp-per-capita)\n\n[http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/CHN](http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/CHN)\n\n[https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/China/](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/China/)\n\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\n*Appreciation Note: You can make the contention that an rising yuan is equivalent to increasing wages, but in effect that is only true to the degree that the wage-earner is buying imports. Wage inflation through a tight labor market more effectively redistributes income share from business owners to workers, while currency appreciation simply has a deflationary impact through diminished import costs (and probably a more positive impact on large holders of Yuan denominated assets who are already wealthy enough to spend abroad).*\n\n*Analytics Note: (1) I’m using YoY change in FX reserves incl. Gold as my “Reserve Accumulation”. This is not a perfect approximation of the flow I would ideally use (reserve purchases) because of reserve asset (especially non-dollar reserve asset) price movements. I think it’s a reasonable enough proxy for the purposes of this post. (2) I also don’t mean to totally ignore other flows and pressures, but won’t do the full balance of payments analysis needed to paint the whole picture — in this case most notably the rest of the capital account. It would only be to demonstrate why these are the important flows I’m talking about. I fear losing the reader’s interest going through why a bunch of other things aren’t the important thing. (3) In this case not doing in GDP terms because I also want to get across the point that the whole scale of the current account and the reserve accumulation is growing. (4) If anyone here has done BoP analysis they’re probably foaming about the fact that the outflows aren’t negative. I thought that might confuse some people, so I didn’t do it. (5) I’m focusing on 1990–2015 because in 2015 some of this dynamic shifted, as there was enough pressure of wealthy folks moving money out of china that the government actually started to sell some reserves (and devalued the yuan 1.5%). The fact that enough people in China had enough money to cause problems with outflows (as well as bust up some real estate markets like Vancouver and Sydney) actually shows that the policy worked.*", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1582719042.0, "tickers": [["B", 2], ["VC", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_faesdq", "title": "Mike Bloomberg", "text": "With a net worth of $64BN as of February 2020, Michael Bloomberg has made headlines recently after his Presidential Campaign has kicked into gear.\n\nLet's take a look at his story and how he became so wealthy...\n\nBloomberg grew up in Medford, Massachusetts, a suburban city not far from Boston. From a young age, Bloomberg demonstrated the drive and persistence that would later manifest itself.\n\nAccording to his mother, \"He wanted to be the boss of whatever we were working on. He wanted to run everything.\"\n\nIn high school, he knew he wanted out of his home town, citing New York as the place to be and emphasising the importance of becoming successful because \"once you had a lot of money you could do things to improve the world.\"\n\nBloomberg attended Johns Hopkins University, where he joined the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. He graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.\n\nIn 1966, he graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA.\n\nAfter he secured his MBA from Harvard, Bloomberg got a job in 1966 (the year England won the World Cup no less...) at Salomon Brothers. He worked in the so-called \"cage\" as a clerk processing trades at $9500 a year - the equivalent today of around $75K.\n\nBloomberg went on to become head of equity trading and sales for five years.\n\nDuring his time at Salomon, Richard Levy, who was working for Bloomberg at the time, tells an interesting story regarding Bloomberg's ruthless work ethic...\n\nLevy's grandfather had just died and the funeral was the next day - the same day that a large client was planning a heavy amount of trading.\n\nBloomberg said: \"‘Would you mind having them change the funeral?'”\n\nLevy refused. Under Jewish law, burial must take place within 24 hours of death.\n\nBloomberg apologised two hours later.\n\nSome years later, when Levy’s son was born, the infant was admitted to intensive care and was facing a blood transfusion.\n\nLevy called up work and said \"I'm staying until he’s out of intensive care”\n\nHowever, when he arrived home later, Bloomberg was calling: \"Where have you been?\" He asked Levy.\n\n\"I was in intensive care\" Levy replied - to which Bloomberg responded:\n\n\"No other father took time off when their kid was born.”\n\nBloomberg apologised to Levy years later after he had kids of his own, but Levy sums it up here:\n\n**\"He's the most brilliant guy I ever worked for, but he's the biggest bastard I ever worked for.\"**\n\nDespite potential character flaws, Bloomberg demonstrated this brilliant with the moves he made in his career...\n\nBloomberg was a general partner at Salomon Brothers.\n\nHe lost out in a power struggle, and was effectively demoted. As he knew a fair amount about computers, Bloomberg was put in charge of Salomon's systems.\n\nBloomberg stayed just long enough to collect a $10MM cash buyout of his partnership stake in the firm as Salomon went public in 1981 in a merger with Philbro. That's the equivalent of around $28MM today. Now that's certainly enough to retire, but Bloomberg had no plans for that. He wanted more.\n\nUsing this money, Bloomberg set up a data services company named Innovative Market Systems (IMS) based on his belief that Wall Street would pay a premium for high-quality business information, delivered instantaneously on computer terminals in a variety of usable formats.\n\nThe company sold customised computer terminals that delivered real-time market data, financial calculations and other analytics to Wall Street firms. These machines later became known as Bloomberg Terminals.\n\nIn 1983, Merrill Lynch became the company's first customer, investing $30 million in IMS to help finance the development of \"the Bloomberg\" terminal computer system. As of 1983, IMS was selling machines exclusively to Merrill Lynch's clients; in 1984, Merrill Lynch released IMS from this exclusive deal.\n\nThe company was then renamed Bloomberg L.P. and by 1990, it had installed 8,000 terminals.\n\nAs of October 2015, the company had more than 325,000 terminal subscribers worldwide. These subscriptions cost $24,000 per year, discounted to $20,000 for two or more.\n\nAs of 2019, Bloomberg employs 20,000 people in dozens of locations.\n\nThe company has a revenue of around $10BN.\n\nTherefore, Bloomberg, with his 88% stake, has climbed up the net worth ranking as the number of terminal subscribers has increased over the years.\n\nBloomberg stated: **\"There might be better traders than me, and there might be people who know more about computers. But there's nobody who knows more about both.\"**\n\nThere are other things of note:\n\n1. He was the mayor of New York City for 12 years, Bloomberg is one of just four individuals to have served that long.\n2. Since signing the Giving Pledge in 2010, Bloomberg has given away $8.2BN\n3. He has announced that he would sell his company if he were elected President.\n\nAlthough perhaps this is unlikely...\n\nDo you think he has a shot of becoming President?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAlyI7cTVy0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAlyI7cTVy0)", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "created_utc": 1582821581.0, "tickers": []}

That may be in question after last week, but a decline is probably overdue.  I think we have all been fed hype by a rigged system\n\nUnemployment is at all-time lows, but the quality of the jobs keeps declining.  1/3 of American workers make less than $20,000 a year, and about 1/2 make less than $30,000.  People work longer hours for worse (or no) benefits with no job security.\n\nThe American dream is fading.  We are seeing a generation to generation standard of living decline.  The middle class is being replaced with haves, and mostly, have-nots. Corporations have been contributing to this decline with a 100% focus on shareholders.  Outsourcing, lay-offs, temp workers, reduced benefits, and automation have led to where we are today.\n\nAt least we have the stock market to boost our wealth!  For those who have enough income to actually save and invest, the stock market has been on a wild bull run since the great recession of 2008. Stocks nearly tripled under Obama, and continued to rise under Trump until last week.  The stock run-up has driven a tremendous growth in wealth for the top echelons in the US.\n\nThe United States is absolutely the wealthiest country in the world.  There are 18.6 million millionaires in the US - about 40% of all the dollar millionaires globally.  Americans are even more dominant in the percentage of Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWI's) who have over $50 million, and of course we rule when it comes to billionaires.\n\nWith all this wealth, the median net worth in the US is $65,000.  Sound OK?  Less than 15% of Americans have a pension, so $65K is really not going to take you very far in retirement.  Wealth in America is extremely top heavy.  Most people do not have adequate savings and are not prepared for retirement.\n\nPredicting the stock market is not possible in the short term, but there are some observations that can be made:\n\n* If you look back in time, you can observe painful stock market corrections and bear markets every few years.  The last big ones were in 2008 and 2000.\n* The Government has been injecting huge amounts of liquidity into the system.\n* Corporations have taken on record levels of debt, lured by artificially low interest rates.\n* Companies have been using profits to buy-back their own stock - boosting stock options and c-suite Exec compensation instead of investing for growth.\n* By most measures, the stock market valuation is much higher than historical averages (still).\n\nThat does not necessarily mean the stock market is going to continue to crash in the short term.  However, history tells us that a bear market will come.  Prepare.\n\nStock market corrections and recessions are pretty much inevitable.  With the right preparation, the Government can typically respond in ways that bring things back to normal over time, including lowering  interest rates or stimulus spending.  Unfortunately, we have squandered the good economics of the past 11 years and will not have those tools available.  Interest rates have been kept artificially low, and there is now little margin left to lower them further if a recession hits.  In addition, the deficit has ballooned under the most recent administration to $1 trillion, so stimulus spending will be difficult.\n\nThe Government is currently spending 1 trillion dollars a year more than they take in through taxes and other revenues, and the only thing we have to show for it is a richer top 1%, a whole lot of low paying jobs with little or no benefits, and crippling debt for our children to deal with.\n\nWhen politicians tell you the economy is fantastic, be skeptical and do some research.  This is especially true when they tell you one day that your Medicare and Social Security will not be touched and then propose massive cuts to those areas in a budget proposal a couple of days later.

When a bank needs cash because its reserves are low, it borrows from other banks, or from the Fed.\n\nWhen a bank borrows money, like anyone else, it must pay an interest rate.  The Fed decides what the base rate will be.  A borrower bank could potentially go to another bank, which will likely charge a slightly higher interest rate, or it could just borrow from the Fed and pay a lower rate.  In reality, the two rates tend to be so close as to make the difference negligible.\n\nThis interest rate charged by the Fed (the Fed Funds Rate) becomes the base rate, and all other interest rates tend to be tied to it, though they are generally higher.  When the Fed Funds Rate goes down, all interest rates go down because in lending to other banks, a bank must be competitive, and being able to borrow money at a lower rate enables the banks to lend it out at a lower rate. When the Fed Funds Rate goes up, all interest rates go up because the banks don't have to compete with the lower rate, and it is more expensive for them to borrow money, so they must lend at a higher rate to be profitable.\n\nWhen interest rates go down, cash is 'cheaper,' and more readily available; this is the how the Fed 'injects' money into the economy.  It is cheaper to borrow money, so more people borrow.  More people get home mortgages and finance new cars, etc.  The money is spent, and this is how the economy is stimulated.\n\nThe Fed puts money into the economy by lending it to banks at a lower rate, and the money quickly filters out to the rest of the economy.", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "created_utc": 1584106735.0, "tickers": []}

To my surprise, the answer was that the rates actually went up for people that want to finance or refinance a home loan.  Here is what she said to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a 30 day snapshot of rates. It is inverted that means the higher the FNMA 30-YR = lower rates. Red is bad meaning it opened up higher (lower rate) and closed lower (higher rate) in that specific day which means rates went up. The bottom line is this is typically what we follow and affects our rates daily. On top of this what is not factored here is capacity levels and volatility in the market. With capacities being maxed, lenders price up rates to slow the volume of applications as they can only handle certain amount of loans at a time no matter what the cost is for the rate. Volatility means that lenders get paid if the loan stays on their books for awhile and if sold off, then the lender loses money on the back end. Volatility in the market or extreme change the lenders add a margin on top of the cost of the money since they are getting killed in servicing and don’t know when it will stabilize. Its very very confusing but I can only tell you that leading up to the best cost on money, banks were kind of factoring in on their rates and with the fed cut last Tuesday, the market went haywire with volumes, capacities and volatility so rates began to price up higher each day starting last Tuesday and then the actual market and cost of money sky rocketed yesterday and today again. I believe things will settle down into a pattern again and banks like patterns because they can begin predicting again which will lower that margin back down. You can see last week we hit 103.5 for a few minutes or hours of that day but the market closed at 102.19 today so that equates to a differential of 1.31 so I have never seen such huge spreads and remember the lower the 30 year bond, the higher the rate is going up. For every .25 it equals about .125% higher rate so you can see that rates just under that portion would be almost .625% higher than 1 week plus ago just on cost. That does not factor in the margins and capacity issues that I referred to. It will take awhile for the market to settle down and rates to begin falling back down again but we are much higher than we were a few weeks or a month ago for sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the customer-facing banks essentially just keep the interest rates unchanged even charge higher for a while on the long term loans, even after the fed cuts the rate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzjzi48x5xm41.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35adbc767343a73dbc78a061a458f8cceb4c5369", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1584314134.0, "tickers": []}

The Bank of Japan (the Japanese Central Bank), also engaged in unprecedented action, buying [101.4 billion yen ($939 million) in stock funds on Thursday](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bank-of-japan-likely-to-strengthen-stimulus-next-week/ar-BB115Gan).

For example, in a recent televised address, [Trump referred to the Coronavirus as a “foreign virus” and announced a travel ban on Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/europe-coronavirus-travel-ban.html). In his speech Trump tried to deflect criticism of his administration’s negligence in responding to Coronavirus, by blaming European leaders for the virus’ spread in the U.S. His argument was that they were not quick enough to ban travel from China, and therefore European travelers seeded the U.S. with the virus. In response to the ban, Gérard Araud, French Ambassador to the U.S., tweeted:\n\n>📷[**Gérard Araud✔**@GerardAraud](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud) Trump needed a narrative to exonerate his administration from any responsibility in the crisis.

While politicians and officials in the EU like Christine Lagarde have called for unprecedented fiscal coordination in the EU, they have been unwilling to provide material and medical aid to other EU countries impact by the Coronavirus. For example, when Italy’s medical system first began to struggle with Coronavirus patients, the country requested assistance from the [Union Civil Protection Mechanism](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en), an EU Civil Protection Mechanism which has a mission to “improve prevention, preparedness and response to disasters.” [Not a single EU country sent Italy any medical supplies or assistance](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/).\n\nThis in part reflects how unprepared other European countries are for this pandemic. However, it also shows deeper lack of coordination between them in this time of crisis. This includes not only the lack of sharing of medical supplies, but also the uncoordinated nature of efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Countries increasingly seek to blame each other for mishandling the Coronavirus, and this is not limited to the Trump administration. For instance, [the European Union just put a 30-day ban on non-essential travel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/03/16/european-union-bans-non-essential-travel-for-at-least-30-days-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/#6d55a99b3544). While the central banks and governments of the world are coordinating a major financial bailout of the big banks and multinational companies, these same governments are also increasingly at odd with each other over how to respond to the virus.\n\nThis is not confined to Western countries. For example, Chinese state officials recently have been [spreading conspiracy theories that the US army brought the virus to Wuhan](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/3075227/why-china-amplifying-conspiracy-theory-blame-america-coronavirus).

This reflects the interests of the Chinese state to use this crisis to its geopolitical advantage. In fact, the pandemic has also become a site of geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China. After initially praising Xi Jinping’s response, [Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the Coronavirus](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/donald-trumps-new-coronavirus-strategy-blame-china-130892).

They are not only at risk from the spread of the virus itself but also from the responses of the government, both local and national.\n\nHomeless communities are highly social environments. Many encampments around the country are home to hundreds of people living in close quarters. Unlike formal residences, these informal settlements lack appropriate access to sanitation services. Running water, toilets, and even soap are not easily accessible to homeless people. [Public health officials are calling for social distancing and limited gatherings to slow the spread of the virus](https://www.newsweek.com/dr-anthony-fauci-says-he-would-like-dramatic-reduction-personal-interactions-social-1492410), but the reality is that many people are totally unable to do these things. This is all the more true for the homeless.\n\nWhile the national response to the Coronavirus pandemic has been [slow](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/03/coronavirus-flawed-cdc-testing-kits-slowed-us-results/4930932002/) and [ineffective](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-coronavirus-response-fail-959868/), state and local efforts to combat the virus have also been problem-ridden.

However, these are mere pittances which do next to nothing to protect the homeless from this virus.\n\nIn 2018, Leila Farha, the UN Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing, visited San Francisco and was horrified by the conditions for the homeless. Noting how homeless people are denied basic access to water, toilets, and sanitation she said, [“The idea that a government would deny people those services …when they have nowhere else to go suggests a kind of cruelty that is unsurpassed.\"](https://www.businessinsider.com/un-expert-san-francisco-homeless-cruelty-2018-11) Last year, an investigation by the New York Times concluded that the conditions for the homeless in Oakland were [comparable to or worse than the conditions in the slums of Mexico City](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/17/us/oakland-california-homeless-camp.html). In normal times, the homeless in the U.S. live in extremely precarious conditions, and face constant evictions and harassment from the government.\n\nDuring this epidemic, the homeless will be particularly hard hit. Studies have found that with the exception of obesity, strokes, and cancer, [the homeless are far more likely to suffer from every category of chronic health problem.](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/Health.pdf) This includes diseases like diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, [which all increase the likelihood of dying from Coronavirus](https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2020/03/09/coronavirus-covid-asthma-diabetes-cancer/4962424002/). Given this situation, some minor improvements to sanitation like handwashing stations are unlikely to do much to deter the spread of Coronavirus among the homeless, especially given that recent studies have shown that [the virus has a significant ability to spread via airborne transmission](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay).\n\nWhat’s more, given the history of abuse and oppression heaped on the homeless, it is likely that during this crisis they will be treated as potential vectors for the virus that endanger the rest of the population. Instead of the government working to provide them with housing and medical care, the homeless could be rounded up and treated as a public safety risk. Historically, the U.S. government has left many poor people to die during disasters. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, [thousands of poor, most black residents of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward were left to fend for themselves](https://www.democracynow.org/2005/9/5/survivors_from_new_orleans_speak_out) while the government focused evacuation and relief efforts on wealthy communities. When the government finally did offer assistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) housed around [30,0000 people in the Superdome, a sports stadium without proper plumbing, food, or supplies](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/08/refuge-of-last-resort-five-days-inside-the-superdome-for-hurricane-katrina). During Hurricane Maria [thousands of people in Puerto Rico died](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/24/763958799/2-years-after-hurricane-maria-hit-puerto-rico-the-exact-death-toll-remains-unkno) in part due to government negligence.\n\nResidents in one of Oakland's largest encampments are well aware of this disturbing possibility. When asked how they felt about the situation, one resident of this encampment said, “they \\[local officials\\] have told us nothing, they could come and put us in FEMA camps.” This fear reflects the experiences of many homeless people, who already regularly have to deal with [violent assaults](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/violence-redefined-nyc-homeless-shelters-keeping-stats-article-1.3826801), [overcrowding](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/shelters-are-overcrowded-more-housing-needed-homeless-northwest-territories), and [poor health conditions](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/homeless-shelter-parents_b_1035952) in the existing shelter system. It’s not unreasonable to assume that during a crisis, they would be treated even worse by a system that already considers them disposable.\n\nIn the current crisis we can see the brutal way the state and national authorities treat people in general. A recent case where this came out was the management of a Coronavirus outbreak on the Grand Princess cruise liner. The cruise ship was off the coast of San Francisco, en-route from Mexico to the U.S., when it reported probable cases of Covid-19 onboard. [The boat was then in limbo for several days](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-diary-of-a-grand-princess-crew-member-as-covid-19-spread-on-the-ship), while president [Trump worried about whether letting the passengers debark from the ship would raise the U.S. number of Coronavirus cases and make him look bad](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-keep-passengers-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-2020-3?op=1). Eventually he agreed to let the passengers get off in Oakland, but at that point the virus had been spreading on the ship for days and days, certainly infecting more of the passengers and the crew.\n\nA[lmost 3000 people disembarked from the vessel over three days, and the US residents aboard were shuttled to nearby military bases to be quarantined](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/03/16/coronavirus-grand-princess-departs-oakland-lets-off-crew/5058788002/). People in this situation were given little information on how long they will be detained, and many reported [dwindling food in the days leading up to their disembarking the vessel](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cruise-ship-guests-food-grand-princess-claims).\n\nNegligent and authoritarian responses like this will only become more common as the situation intensifies. Furthermore, state and federal agencies are under more pressure to “do more.” Homeless people are some of the most vulnerable in our society. Both authoritarian crackdowns and a lack of action to protect the homeless will impact them even more. Given the response we have seen to Coronavirus so far, it seems likely that the state will mismanage this situation as well, putting many at risk through a mix of negligence and repressive measures.\n\n*For more of our updates, follow us on twitter (*[*https://twitter.com/revunitedfront*](https://twitter.com/revunitedfront)*) or check out our website:* [https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/)\n\n**About us: We're the Revolutionary United Front, a US-based revolutionary organization in the U.S. organizing in the Greater Boston, New York, and San Francisco areas.

What if all these store closed their doors to public access but stayed open still as a source for items such as groceries and home goods. \n\nThis would not allow any public access for those who might already have contracted the virus and help stop the spread of the virus. In Turn these stores can hire 10x to 15x the amount of employees they already have at minimum wage and set up a system to complete at home deliveries. \n\n***What about paying these employees?***\n\nSo yes this might take a toll on the balance sheet short term but the government can offer a huge tax break for these companies to pay them back overtime thus lessen some of the pressure and lower the total amount needed on the stimulus bill. The government would also pick up the gas charges for these employees but at the rate they are now that would be a such a small amount. The companies employing these new staff members would be able to gain back these expenses through a 5-10 plan of lower tax rates over time. Also the employees that do work for the company would still get a stimulus check but for less than the amount given to the rest of the country not working. The catch is once you add up the weekly check and the stimulus check they will end up with a greater total than those not working but also helps finance through these tough times by having a weekly check instead of just a monthly. \n\n***Now What about the employees being contagious?***\n\nThis is where the government needs to step up their game. All employees that are to be hired will have to be tested with negative results to be eligible to be hired. That way there is a guarantee that they will not be passing the virus to each household they are delivering too. One thing that could help with making sure these employees stay virus free is to use a local hotel and give them room and bored for free with the government paying for the cost of the rooms at some discounted price to allow these places to have some revenue instead of nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The benefits?***\n\nTo start this will keep all citizens out of crowded places and will have these items delivered to their home and never have to come into contact with the delivery driver. All deliveries will be delivered to the house by the end of the current day  or the end of the next day depending on the demand. With the vast amount of employees that they could hire with the unemployment rate quickly rising they will be able to hire to be able to meet the demand. Next the stores will take pressure away from the extremely hard working employees that are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked and ease pressure on the supply chains. Then comes the short term government spending. Yes this will cost a large sum but with what analysts are saying the government needs to spend some have the number upwards of 3 trillion dollars so this would lower that number considerably in the short term and then over time once we make it through this crisis the remaining amount will be paid back through time by those tax benefits and tax breaks. The economy will be back up and running in this time though so while paying these companies back they are making money to stay stable and strong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are so many more ways this can benefit not only the economy but the local communities that are involved. The companies will still be generating revenue for the products. Please if you know a better place that this should be posted feel free to repost this there or get the word around. I know there will be laws and licenses but the government can by pass these just for the time we are going through this.

{"name": "t3_fly4r4", "title": "A Contagion Is Spreading Through the Economy Too", "text": "As government agencies open the floodgates for bailouts and payouts, the sober reality is the present economic crisis is only going to get worse, and is quickly “infecting” supply-chains and financial systems already severely weakened by epidemic related work-interruptions.\n\nA prescient framework for understanding “supply-chain infection” was mapped out in 2012, in a paper by risk consultant David Korowicz, titled [Trade-Off Financial System Supply-Chain Cross-Contagion: a study in global systemic collapse](http://images.feasta.org/2012/10/Trade_Off_Korowicz.pdf).\n\nThe paper examined how the interrelated nature of the global economy can quickly lead to massive failure because of the reliance of production of goods and services on a limited number of essential but vulnerable systems—in particular in the financial and energy sectors. The financial sector has already contributed to the compromised nature of our present economy because of a constantly increasing debt-to-product ratio. In other words, the amount of actual money being lent out in the global economy far exceeds the monetary value of actual goods and services, and this is particularly bad news in crisis situations.\n\nIf major agencies default on debt payments, the credit market could quickly freeze up. Withheld letters of credit could quickly threaten basic trade, as such guarantees are used to insure the safety of transactional agreements. This would lead to severe shortages very quickly. It is possible authorities may manage to stave off such a crisis in the United States, as they just barely managed to do in 2008. But even in this optimistic scenario, it would be unreasonable to believe the fundamental problems underlying the crisis would be resolved.\n\nFurthermore, while the mess of our financial system in crisis will be difficult for authorities to untangle, Korowicz convincingly argues that production and supply-chain relations are *even mor*e complicated. The complex interrelation of goods and services required for creating the basic necessities of life, including food, transportation and other commodities, is nearly impossible to fully map-out. One example of this complexity is that on average 15,000 individual parts are necessary to produce a single car. The loss of even one critical component for producing such an item can lead to massive interruptions, as this would result in paused production on this and all other lines requiring that component, or which require components that incorporate that critical part.\n\nThis is already starting to occur, as large scale work interruptions around the globe are creating shortages of goods. In one case, Boeing’s 787 and 767 planes require parts from a manufacturer in northern Italy. General Electric, which supplies 90% of Boeing’s engines, also requires parts from Italy. Production of [a whole series of goods has ground to a halt in Italy](https://qz.com/1815731/italys-luxury-manufacturing-is-threatened-by-coronavirus/) while the country is on lockdown due to the Coronavirus. Coupled with Boeing’s ongoing safety and reliability problems, this has pushed [the company to the point of collapse.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/economy/boeing-coronavirus-economy.html)\n\nKorowicz convincingly argues that the highly interrelated nature of our global economy *makes it even more vulnerable to crises*. In Boeing’s case, had the company maintained its traditional vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy (i.e. primarily in-house, U.S. based production of its various components) that it abandoned in the early 2000s, it would now face less immediate fallout from the present loss of production capability in Italy. Interestingly, the company’s move towards aggressive outsourcing was not merely part of a larger global trend, but was [promoted by its partners in the U.S. military](https://www.csmonitor.com/1996/1216/121696.us.us.1.html) in the mid 1990s.\n\nFollowing the [hundreds of deaths resulting from the company’s 737 Max engineering disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/business/boeing-737-crashes.html), the company has tried to reverse its decades long shift away from vertical integration. However, [it has faced major obstacles in doing so](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-experts-suppliers-talk-of-pushing-up-jet-production-while-pushing-down-costs/).\n\nWhile limited shortages have already been reported for food and other supplies, breakdowns in supply chains have likely only just begun. Stores and agencies generally have a certain reserve capacity on hand for sudden interruptions in supply or for increases in demand. Right now many stores and other businesses are using such reserves to restock depleted supplies, *but this will not be tenable long-term*. It is essential to grasp the non-linear impact of a crisis. Operations will increasingly fail because of a lack of cash-flow or because of a lack of labor. Already many people laid off from jobs are worried about how they will buy food even with a mostly stable situation at supermarkets at present. Disconcertingly, if food supply chains start to crumble, Korowicz states that cities only have about a three day food supply on hand at a given moment, and that without serious pre-planning, *authorities will not be able to establish alternatives for weeks.*\n\nLikewise, the impact from serious disruptions caused by the last several days of U.S. work stoppages will have major implications in the weeks ahead. As Korowicz states, “Pandemic modeling has shown that removing at random only small numbers of a population can cause cascading failure of functions across an economy.” He states that these failures would soon threaten to disrupt the functioning of large infrastructure such as power plants. Such pieces of infrastructure require thousands of specific parts to operate, as well as specialized skills to carry out repairs, possessed by people who may well be unable to work now because of sickness or quarantine. The impact of disruptions are magnified when they occur in a major economic power such as the United States, which provides many irreplaceable skills and services to the global economy.\n\nSuch shockwaves are likely to increase in the near future, driven by an economic system made even more vulnerable by its reliance on debt. As Korowicz states “A contracting economy is incompatible with the credit backing the global economy.”\n\nIn one example of how the pandemic crisis is already cascading into a financial crisis, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Agency (MTA) yesterday requested [a federal bailout of $4 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-subway-federal-aid-.html). The MTA requested this nicely rounded figure based on a projected decrease of “$3.7 billion *from lost fares in the next few months*, should ridership trends continue” and for “coronavirus-specific expenses, like disinfecting subway cars and stations” estimated to reach $300 million.\n\nThese numbers do not add up.\n\nAccording to the MTA’s own numbers, the agency collects about [$741 million in total fares, tolls, and advertising per month](https://new.mta.info/document/12481), meaning that the $3.7 billion figure is closer to a situation in which the number of NYC commuters *was reduced to zero for a five-month period*. And this is without even factoring in operating savings that would accrue to the MTA given reduced bus and train schedules due to future interruptions.\n\nAs the *New York Post* pointed out, the MTA is hiding its obvious debt problem. One of the MTA’s biggest expenses is simply paying back interest on a debt which is [projected to rise to $52 billion in 2023](https://nypost.com/2020/03/11/subway-riders-might-pay-for-mtas-debt-with-fare-raises-cut-service/), up from $35 billion last year. Simply paying interest on its debt approaches the total annual amount the agency pays for labor. As a result, a relatively minor immediate loss of revenue can be disastrous to the agency, making it unable to make payments to its creditors. Put another way, the agency even in normal times is barely solvent, creating a scenario in which a ripple, such as present difficulties, threatens to quickly submerge it and its financial backers, putting them beyond a point of no-return.\n\n“The gist of it is that the risk of debt is just the same for the MTA as it is to a person,” said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, quoted in the Post’s article.“You can’t afford to have anything go wrong. You can’t lose your job. The MTA can’t have any setback of any kind or you won’t be able to pay off your debt.”\n\nAnd the same applies to the economy on a wider scale. It is extremely vulnerable to disruption.\n\nAs Korowicz [stated in a blog post earlier this month](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-03-04/we-need-to-talk-about-catastrophic-global-risk/), “The government will no-doubt do everything they can to support businesses and the banking system with credit and stimulus, adding yet more debt to an already overindebted system. That will constrain future economic growth, increase the likelihood of future financial crises, and make the country less resilient to the next shock, from whatever the source. It is also straining political legitimacy, adding further uncertainty.”\n\nIn other words, the government will attempt to continue to plug up the vast numbers of holes in what amounts to a doomed ship, rather than creating a solid foundation to address the present medical and economic catastrophe.\n\nTellingly, as part of an apparent organizational hope within the *New York Times* that large-moves by the state and federal government can resolve the present crisis, the paper yesterday did not see fit to include any reporting about the MTA’s debt burden in its coverage of the agency’s bailout plea.\n\nAs crises continue to flare related to the pandemic, it is important to comprehend the even greater perils that may soon emerge. From Trump, to state government, to liberal critics, it seems that these risks presently are simply not being taken into consideration.\n\n*For more of our updates, follow us on twitter (*[*https://twitter.com/revunitedfront*](https://twitter.com/revunitedfront)*) or check out our website:* [https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/)\n\n**About us: We're the Revolutionary United Front, a US-based revolutionary organization in the U.S. organizing in the Greater Boston, New York, and San Francisco areas.

Some steps in this direction have already been taken. Earlier this week, the Bay Area [issued a “shelter in place” order](https://www.sfchronicle.com/local-politics/article/Bay-Area-must-shelter-in-place-Only-15135014.php), which directed everyone in the region to stay in their homes as much as possible. New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio [indicated that he is contemplating imposing a similar order in the city](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-shelter-in-place.html). In a recent interview with MSNBC TV host Rachel Maddow, DeBlasio stated that [New York City needs “military assistance” to combat the spread of the Coronavirus](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/nyc-mayor-on-federal-coronavirus-aid-can-t-wait-for-help-that-may-not-come-80891461888?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma).

[Numerous](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/from-the-archives/2020/03/17/martial-law-once-enforced-quarantines-in-dallas/) [news agencies](https://sports.yahoo.com/coronavirus-lead-martial-law-214017748.html) have recently [run articles](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/what-is-martial-law) about the possibility of martial law being imposed across the country.

[Google searches for martial law](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0dbs_) in the U.S. have skyrocketed in the past few days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvzmkwbf7rn41.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5f67c8002e6a7d60bf5387e60b4ac93ad6455b8\n\n*A graph of google searches for the term “martial law” over time*\n\nIn the U.S. martial law entails the suspension of the writ of *habeas corpus*, meaning that people would no longer have a right to a court hearing or trial if imprisoned. It grants the military broad sweeping powers, and if imposed it would likely mean that people would be required to go through military checkpoints to move between states or even around cities. In the history of the United States, martial law on a national-level has only been declared once. This was done by [Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.](https://lawi.us/history-of-martial-law/) After the Civil War, this decision was declared unconstitutional in the Supreme Court case [*Ex parte Milligan*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/71/2).\n\nMartial law has also been imposed at a state-level numerous times, during the period of big political struggles such as [the Colorado Coalfield War](https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/coalwar.html), [the West Virginia Coal Wars](https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2018/09/buried-history-west-virginias-coal-wars/), and during [the Civil Rights Movement.](http://digital.archives.alabama.gov/cdm/ref/collection/voices/id/5382) In each of these instances, martial law was used as a pretext to crack down on people’s movements, to suppress dissent, and to prevent people from having a right to a trial by a jury of their peers. The U.S. government has been using the Coronavirus crisis to [roll back financial regulations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/coronavirus-economy-dodd-frank.html) and push for legislation which would [eliminate encrypted electronic communications](https://tech.newstatesman.com/security/earn-it-us-bill-end-encryption).\n\nAll of this raises real questions about the imposition of martial law. While it would be framed as a necessary step to fight the spread of the virus, we should be very wary of the government’s efforts to undermine our democratic rights during a crisis of this magnitude. The Trump administration’s initial response to the pandemic has been [widely criticized as being incompetent at containing the spread of Coronavirus](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/here-are-17-ways-the-trump-administration-bungled-its-coronavirus-response/). Trump repeatedly downplayed the dangers of the virus, [comparing it to the seasonal flu](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-coronavirus-flu-vaccine-us-pandemic-meeting-leonard-schleifer-a9371286.html). He even went so far as to [call it a hoax.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/trump-says-the-coronavirus-is-the-democrats-new-hoax.html) In a matter of days the administration’s response has shifted. Now they are considering martial law and a total lock-down of the country. While some may consider this a necessary step to fight the spread of the virus, the administration’s pattern of blatant disregard for the health and well being of the people during this pandemic raises serious questions about the imposition of martial law. The government’s [inability to do something as simple as increase testing capacity](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-per-capita-chart-us-behind-2020-3?op=1) also raises questions about how effective martial law would be at slowing the spread of Coronavirus. This sort of lock-down would necessarily entail a massive curtailment of civil liberties, and it would also set a precedent, justifying future use of martial law during times of crisis. All of this should give us pause.\n\n*For more of our updates, follow us on twitter (*[*https://twitter.com/revunitedfront*](https://twitter.com/revunitedfront)*) or check out our website:* [https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/)\n\n**About us: We're the Revolutionary United Front, a US-based revolutionary organization in the U.S. organizing in the Greater Boston, New York, and San Francisco areas.

It is typically a pretty short-term metric that relies entirely on technical analysis. That means it doesn’t incorporate anything to do with the health or profitability of the underlying company.\n\nPrice action is generally the best indicator of sentiment. For a stock to go up, investors must feel good about it. Similarly, a stock that is in a downtrend must be out of favour.\n\n*InvestorsObserver*’s Sentiment Indicator considers price action and recent trends in volume. Increasing volumes often mean that a trend is strengthening, while decreasing volumes can signal that a reversal could come soon.\n\nThe options market is another place to get signals about sentiment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 9.13% between February 23 and February 28, recording the biggest two-day point decline in history on Tuesday and Wednesday. The S&P 500 lost 8.24% and the NASDAQ Composite declined by 7.09%. All three indexes lost all the gains from the beginning of the year and are now in the red year-to-date.\n\nThe main reason for the decline is uncertainty over the long-term impact of the coronavirus, that had not been priced into the markets. The growth in cases outside China is on the rise and the Centers for Disease Control issued a warning that Americans should brace themselves for disruptions related to the virus outbreak. Amid uncertainty and warnings from companies and analysts that revenue and profits will be impacted by consumer spending and supply chain issues, investors decided to rush to the exits.  \n   \nAdditionally, it seems like Financial Advisors were looking for some silver lining and a number of new stocks made the list of most searched tickers last week. Among these, it’s worth to mention Gilead Sciences, inc. (NASDAQ: GILD), Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA), and Co-Diagnostics Inc (NASDAQ: CODX).\n\nAll three of these stocks captured the attention of Financial Advisors due to their involvement in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. Co-Diagnostics on February 24 obtained regulatory clearance for its Logix SmartCoronavirus COVID-19 test to be sold as an in-vitro test for the diagnosis of coronavirus in markets that accept CE marking as valid regulatory approval. In this way, Co-Diagnostics can export and sell the test in the European Union. The company plans to increase production to meet the demand.\n\nModerna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) was in the spotlight on the back of two developments. On February 24, the company said that the first batch of its vaccine against the COVID-19 was shipped to US government researchers for a phase 1 study. The trial is expected to start in April, around three months from the vaccine design. Two days later, Moderna posted its fourth-quarter results, which showed a 60.2% annual drop in revenues to $14.1 million and a net loss of $124.2 million (up by 13.8% on the year).

That is economics and it has been true since the dawn of time it will not change because of COVID-19.\n\nTo be clear - I am not against fiscal stimulus at ALL. It is EXACTLY what we need to do in a situation like this. But the money needs to go to poor and middle class people and here is why. One dollar of stimulus will be treated in the following ways:\n\n1. 100% of the stimulus you give to a poor person will be spent and put into the economy.\n2. 95-98% of the stimulus you give to a working class person will be spent and put into the economy.\n3. About 30% of the stimulus you give to the wealthiest population will be spent, the rest will be either saved, or invested. Which is CRUCIAL to an economy. I'm not a socialist but here's the difference:\n\nIn a situation like this where you have an abrupt absolute halt in the economy every dollar you spend has to be on keeping the economy afloat and functioning properly.\n\nThis stimulus will be profitable for businesses in the sense that the money spent in the economy will work it's way UP the pyramid through profitable business. If you give stimulus to wealthy people to invest in a situation like this it will either:\n\n1. Not be spent or invested and just saved, which doesn't accomplish what you wanted to. or 1:\n2. Is invested in a new business venture which is either, doomed to fail since every dollar is being spent on essentials OR is invested into businesses that provide essential services but there is still a time lag, only being half as effective.\n\nTLDR; Fiscal stimulus NEEDS to go to the bottom of the pyramid and work it's way up through profitable businesses in situations like this because 99% of that money - A much higher proportion that wealthy populations - is spent on the economy.\n\nFeel free to disagree or discuss I'd love to talk about it.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ChrisFryett/status/1243688738934476801?s=20](https://twitter.com/ChrisFryett/status/1243688738934476801?s=20)", "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1585356691.0, "tickers": []}

So maybe by switching to this new \"resource-based\" system, the government can actually focus all the available resources on what matters, like providing hospitals with equipment, providing labs with whatever they need to study the virus and enforcing quarantine.

{"name": "t3_frm0mu", "title": "What Is Being Stated Here And Does It Make Sense?", "text": "So I'm in an argument with some people on economics, when someone posted this big beast dump of text in claiming economic freedom/free market is self-defeating and that the market should be run by the state? I think? I'm not 100% sure what this person is saying to be honest but I could use some help in understanding if what's being said is right or not, and what might be the best responce:\n\n>Economics isn't basic. Pretty much all of the basic requirements of basic economic theory are malleable, which introduces complexity, which makes any and all basic theory invalid. Supply, demand, public opinion, competitor viability, vendor freedoms, mobility of goods and services and customers... pretty much everything can be manipulated by those with the power to do so, and power has many vectors, but they all have the same thing in common, those with it will desire to have more of it, and possess the means to acquire it in such a way as to increase the power differential between them and those with less. The free market is a pyramid scheme. It is more complex than the archetypal pyramid scheme, and even has money flow down, but on the large scale it occurs at a consistently uneven rate. Yes, there are exceptions, but on the large scale it remains consistent that \"the rich get richer\" because they possess the means, motive, and opportunity to do so, and \"the poor get poorer\" in relative terms is an inevitable consequence.\n\n>Here we come to the real failure of the system, the poor steadily lose resources relative the optimal standards, and thus lose the ability to express themselves financially. While basic economic theory doesn't describe the overall system at all, it does still describe some events on the smaller scale, especially amongst those with less opportunity to exploit the system: those with the least power. People at the poorer levels require economic expression in order to facilitate their requirements in order to continue functioning, and they steadily become more and more marginalised until they are completely marginalised, such as occurred in \"the global financial crisis\" with a bunch of economic professionals exploiting financially inexperienced and desperate people into loans that they couldn't manage, but were largely necessary because they weren't meeting their requirements regardless, and putting them into debt was more profitable than leaving them alone to be financially starved into literal inability to take part in the market. Like all pyramid schemes, it is dependent upon the lowest level to continue to provide profits, when a pyramid scheme becomes universal, it cannot feed itself, and swiftly dies from the bottom up as each level finds its dependencies shrivelling up beneath them.\n\n>The free market has been attempted, poorly, and failed catastrophically every time. State-run economies have typically been run by dubious governments (largely as a result of them being a massive shift and requiring revolution, but clearly are an economic phenomena, rather than a political phenomena, and thus could function under most any government that doesn't have an explicit economic component, which is sadly all too common), and almost always have clear external pressure explicitly opposing them, but have a tolerable track-record when operating on the small-scale such as with voluntary social special-interest-groups. Free markets on the other hand have often occurred on the small scale, and seen some adoption on the larger, and always crash. People accuse these crashes of being events with specific causes, they are not. Economic crashes are the product of the dependencies being disempowered to the point of desperation, and are corrected by massive welfare-state-in-all-but-name movements to correct the imbalance. The inevitable stable state of the free market is slavery-in-all-but-name as corporations find their employees steadily less and less \"competent\"(read: insufficient funds to operate independently) and thus requiring more and more assistance, which inevitably progresses into running their entire life, which inevitably progresses into \"or else\" at which point their freedom is completely curtailed, but the perpetually expanding proportion of people too poor to function independently, well, those of them that are compatible with the standardised service, are maintained arbitrarily to a functional state, and thus able to continue to service the economy. Why hasn't this already happened? Because people do not like that idea, and propaganda and robotics have not yet attained the necessary technological advancement.\n\n>We could go to the classic farming community example. Two equal(hah!) bakeries (we won't be going into why there are two when one would comfortably exceed the requirements and two results in significant overhead) operate in the hamlet. The grain harvest arrived at the end of summer, each bakery bought and stored their own grain to their own granary, at which point the farmers all shipped all of their grain to the big city to immediately exchange raw goods for reinvestment opportunities. One bakery bought four times enough grain to last a season, the other enough for but one. One bakery made a season's worth of bread and put it up for market, while preparing to do the same for the rest of the year. One bakery had twice the available funds and directed those into a crier outside the main hall to bring in customers, and a professional baker and exotic ingredients to make deluxe breads, and refurbished their shop to look clean and comfortable, and bought tables for people to loiter around their business and provide social pressure to remain there... but gaining many complimentary factors converging, they spend twice the money for four times the effect which cycled back into the public mind to reinforce itself to 8 times the market share. One of these bakeries got no business, and went out of business, and was then bought by the other, which now had all of their competitor's grain stores, so the hamlet starved in the winter and had to buy grain from the big city at an unsustainable markup and then they went out of business too and everyone starved to death in the spring. But wait, how did they starve when they bought their competitor's grain? Why, because their competitor wasn't stupid enough to prioritise the long term when failure to prioritise the short term is fatal, and with a competition-based system... it always is! So nobody bought enough grain! Ain't the prisoner's dilemma grand!\n\n>The sad truth is that freedom is self-defeating. Two computers that can calculate every possible chess move have no freedom. Two grandmasters who know the game to a level most people don't know anything use only the tiniest fraction of the possible moves. Two amateurs who just want to take pieces have a vast array of options. The amateurs have more freedom. Freedom, taken to extremes, always results in universal competition. Competition always results in a cost to suboptimal actions, and all costs being cumulative. To have any choice in one's conduct, one must have the opportunity to engage in suboptimal actions, which cannot exist in a society dedicated to freedom. If someone is free to use their time, and spends it upon, say, recreation, or the wellbeing of their children, then some amongst their peers will dedicate more time to their professional standing and take the available promotions, at which point it will become evident that the first someone is less effective(due to their demonstrated inability to gain promotions), and they will be further relegated to irrelevance(see: age discrimination). If one's employment is state-mandated, then they lack the freedom to dedicate their time towards professional success, which grants them a far greater freedom in how to allocate their time. Freedom, left to its own devices, is self-defeating. Effective freedom is only found when freedom's excesses are constrained. Freedom is a vital and valuable component of life, but an absolutely appalling ideal. Thus, I propose that libertarians, those who seek freedom, should seek to minimise the influence of competition upon one's ability to participate in society.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1585551461.0, "tickers": []}

And he surely knows that without money printing to purchase debt and put it on the books of the Fed, that the debt markets would hardly resolve to 0% with $2T chasing financing because of supply/demand dynamics.  The Fed had already announced that they would print and buy $500B of Trump's $1T deficit.   Now Paul want us to think that they want to place $2T in the debt markets, and think interest rates would stay at 0% while private purchasers and not the Fed buy the debt.      \nI don't buy that this piece was honestly written.

{"name": "t3_fspmpk", "title": "U.S. Fat Cats Consider a \"Virus Be Damned, Get Back to Work!\" Policy", "text": "As the Coronavirus crisis intensifies globally, the U.S. elite are growing increasingly concerned about the impact that this pandemic will have on the economy and their wealth. Last week James Bullard, President of the St. Louis Fed, said that [GDP could contract up to 50% in Q2 2020, and that unemployment could reach 30%.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/unemployment-surge-to-30-percent-q2-gdp-50-percent-james-bullard-2020-3-1029022288) Major banks have put out [similar analyses](https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/markets/morgan-stanley-sees-us-economy-plunging-30-25-in-second-quarter/ar-BB11yajt). The impact of the economic downturn and work interruptions are being felt across all sectors of the economy. Last week [U.S. unemployment claims skyrocketed to 3,280,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-unemployment-idUSKBN21D1WJ), a 3 million increase over the previous week. This means that around one percent of the entire U.S. population filed for unemployment last week. This shattered the previous record of 695,000 unemployment claims in a week, which was set in 1982.\n\nThe number of unemployment claims [will likely increase in the coming weeks](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/26/a-word-about-the-horrid-spike-in-unemployment-claims-and-why-its-even-more-horrid-than-it-appears/). The numbers from last week are from the claims that were filed on the week ending March 21st, and therefore do not reflect the number of people who filed last week. During the week of the 21st, [many state unemployment websites crashed](https://news.yahoo.com/state-unemployment-websites-crash-applications-150200792.html), preventing people from filing online. As a result, many of these people ended up filing for unemployment this past week. What’s more, the $2 trillion stimulus package includes [provisions which allow gig workers such as Uber drivers to file for unemployment benefits](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-relief-act-expanded-unemployment-payment-and-eligibility.html) as well. This is a welcome change, and long overdue, but it does mean that we can expect that unemployment claims will continue to climb in the coming weeks. And we are still only at the beginning of a crisis that is [expected to last for 18 months](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/there-isnt-going-be-all-clear-signal/608512/). Italy was unable to contain the spread of the Coronavirus even after imposing social distancing measures similar to those in effect in the U.S. right now. In a last ditch effort to stop the spread, they ultimately decided to [shut down all industrial production for at least 15 days](https://news.yahoo.com/germany-drops-deficit-dogma-deaths-184032455.html).\n\nWhile the measures taken here in the U.S. do not entail a complete shutdown of industrial production, the U.S. elite and especially the big capitalists are not thrilled about the prospect of a similar shutdown. Last week Trump said that [“America will again and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting.\"](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/trump-coronavirus-lockdown-skepticism-143800) He also stated that [he wants to see “packed churches” on Easter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2020/03/27/churches-easter-trump-closed-coronavirus-services/). He has since [walked back this goal](https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/trump-extends-social-distancing-measures-to-april-30-walks-back-easter-reopening-plans/ar-BB11SH5q). Despite this reversal, Trump has not been the only one pushing to rush everyone back to work during the pandemic. His statements are not isolated incidents, but represent a growing trend among the U.S. elite, who stand to lose billions in future profits and lose global influence if the shutdown continues.\n\nFor example, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, recently tweeted that ‘[Extreme measures to flatten the virus “curve” is sensible-for a time-to stretch out the strain on health infrastructure. But crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue-and beyond. Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.](https://twitter.com/lloydblankfein/status/1241907502662418437)’ On Fox Business, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow recently stated that, [“There’s no question we have to think seriously. I would say, after the 15-day period is over, which I guess ends after this weekend, we will take another look at targeting areas \\[to reopen businesses\\] that are safe enough.\"](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/larry-kudlow-trump-coronavirus-business-restrictions-15-days) Big capitalists like Bob Luddy (founder of CaptiveAire systems) have argued that if [the U.S. doesn’t “get back to work” by March 30, it will be a total disaster](https://spectator.org/back-to-work-by-march-30-a-coronavirus-imperative/). Right-wing talkshow host Glenn Beck, even went so far as to state, [\"I would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working\\[...\\]Even if we all get sick, I'd rather die than kill the country.\"](https://www.salon.com/2020/03/25/glenn-beck-tells-older-americans-to-get-back-to-work-id-rather-die-than-kill-the-country/) He also noted that he hoped his comments trended on social media.\n\nIt’s not just billionaires, libertarians, and right-wing news networks who are pushing these ideas. The New York Times recently ran an opinion column by Thomas Friedman, a columnist at the paper, [in which Friedman made similar arguments](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/coronavirus-economy.html?fbclid=IwAR2j6dA_UUUABRCZEj7vqtq0uydKuq5elicaAKstv3BKbb_VMaLhLSyP1_w). A few days before that, the Times [ran a similar opinion piece by David L. Katz](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html), president of True Health Initiative and the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal recently [published an opinion piece that made a similar argument](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rethinking-the-coronavirus-shutdown-11584659154).\n\nWhile there is not yet a complete bipartisan consensus on this issue, it is concerning to see a large section of the U.S. elite so openly proclaiming their willingness to let millions die to further their political and economic interests. If people are rushed back to work before the pandemic has died down, or before there is a vaccine, this will lead to a massive outbreak and the unnecessary deaths of millions of people. This would be akin to responses during the 1918 Flu pandemic in which some places rushed people back to work and hosted big public gatherings, which led to [massive spikes in the weekly death rate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/03/how-cities-flattened-curve-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-coronavirus/).\n\nCriticism of this push to get people back to work during the pandemic have primarily [focused on how this prioritizes profit over the lives and well-being of people](https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/03/27/i-will-not-kill-my-mother-for-your-stock-portfolio/). This is an important criticism. It exposes the logic of the present social system which serves the interests of the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the poor and oppressed people. These exposures are all the more important during times of crisis when so many are in dire straits both from the virus itself, and also the looming economic depression. However, it is also important to see that push to get everyone back to work is not just about driving the stock market higher and maximizing corporate profits. The U.S. elite have a series of economic and political interests which are related to, but not reducible to maximizing their profits and driving the stock market higher.\n\nFor example, competition between the U.S. and China has been intensifying in recent years. This has manifested in many ways including the military build up in the South China Sea, and the ongoing trade war. Right now, the U.S. elite are worried that [the Coronavirus could reshape the global order](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order) and allow China—which seems to be recovering from the virus—to overtake the U.S. as a the dominant global superpower. Major think tanks and policy circles have speculated that if China recovers from the virus before the U.S., then the former [will make big political and economic inroads into regions like the Middle East at the expense of U.S corporations](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/03/covid-19-impacts-on-strategic-dynamics-in-the-middle.html). They are also concerned that China could strengthen its relationship with [European countries like Italy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/) by providing them with economic and medical assistance during this crisis.\n\nThe push to get everyone back to work is also related to the U.S. elite's concerns about [major disruptions to global supply chains](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/a-contagion-is-spreading-through-the-economy-too/). Some key industries are already [shutting down some production](https://www.postandcourier.com/health/covid19/sc-automakers-temporarily-closing-manufacturing-plants-due-to-coronavirus-supply/article_25e08da2-6aa5-11ea-9056-af6c129aca07.html) due to supply shortages. There is [growing concern about what is known as the bullwhip effect](https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2020/03/12/coronavirus-supply-and-demand-economic-effect) in supply chain engineering. The basic concept is that as one supplier attempts to adjust to new changes in demand and available parts, like those caused by the present crisis, relatively smaller misadjustments by this initial supplier can lead to even bigger miscalculations down-stream or upstream. The metaphor to the bullwhip is that a small change/disruption—like a flick of the wrist—leads to bigger changes down the line, like the movement at the end of the whip. This is already playing out in multiple ways throughout the economy.\n\nFor example, many hospitals have urgently been requesting supplies of personal protection equipment, such as masks and gloves. While there have been steps to address these shortages—such as [automanufacturers shifting production to make ventilators and masks](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/two-gm-plants-will-build-ventilators-masks-to-help-fight-covid-19-pandemic/ar-BB11O17H)—other shortages throughout the medical system have been neglected, [including medicine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/critical-inhaler-medication-shortage-looms-coronavirus-cases-soar/story?id=69759965) and [many other medical devices](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-supply-chain-update). In the end it is likely there will be an oversupply of gloves, and [undersupply of](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/03/02/coronavirus-outbreak-will-lead-to-more-drug-shortages-in-the-us-including-antibiotics/#3b425623320f) these other products.\n\nOn a larger scale, the initial outbreak of Coronavirus in China and the related economic downturn there [led to major disruptions in production and supply](https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/trade-lanes/trans-pacific/coronavirus-could-delay-normal-post-cny-trans-pac-flow-march_20200210.html) of made goods made in China. This led to a [significant loss of profits to producers there](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-industrial-profits-idUSKBN21E08I?taid=5e7da812e370aa0001622e7d). It also led to major [disruptions in supply for manufacturers around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/hyundai-south-korea-coronavirus.html) who rely on parts and equipment made in China. Following a partial recovery from the pandemic, many businesses and factories in China have quickly invested in the reopening of operations throughout the country, assuming that their international customers would purchase the same approximate quantity of goods that they did before the crisis. However, faced with [declines in demand because of economic crises in the U.S. and Europe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already), these factory owners may experience even further losses on investments. They are already beginning to face issues [due to reduced demand from Europe, the U.S., and other parts of the world.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already) In the face of this downturn, some may overcompensate in other direction and drastically cut back production to a degree that leaves those who require their products with no choice but to look elsewhere, or to go out of business.\n\nHoward Shatz, a senior economist at the Rand Corporation [recently noted that the impact of production disruptions in Europe on the U.S. economy will be even more significant than the impact of earlier disruptions in China](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/03/the-economic-wallop-of-covid-19-qa-with-rand-experts.html). He stated, “Think about this: China is a major trading partner, and its shutdown negatively affected a lot of U.S. businesses. But the United States receives only 15 percent of its imports from China and sends only 7 percent of its exports to China. We send 34 percent of our exports to the EU and receive 30 percent of our imports from the EU. Now those economies are shut down. Our neighbors Canada and Mexico are also major trading partners with us, so our economic health will depend in part on theirs as well.\n\nGiven the non-linear nature of supply-chain disruptions, there is growing worry that economic disruption from the virus will lead to major shortages of important goods, [including a possible world-wide shortage of food](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns). This is growing concern because workers in key food industries are [falling sick with the virus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/food-workers-getting-sick-is-the-latest-threat-to-world-supply). Close quarters and dangerous working conditions make many food factories and slaughterhouses especially dangerous environments during a pandemic. Government officials around the world are already expressing concern [about food riots](https://thewire.in/food/pronob-sen-karan-thapar-coronavirus-food-riots), and last week the Red Cross agency warned that the Coronavirus could [spark mass unrest among West's urban poor](https://news.trust.org/item/20200327134620-yc7e3). The U.S. elite are especially worried about their ability to contain this unrest, given that [police forces across the country](https://apnews.com/069d01bafbb1f15b1f6c4a4479ab1456) and [members of the military are falling sick](https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/other/sailors-on-warships-like-uss-theodore-roosevelt-vulnerable-as-coronavirus-spreads/ar-BB11S7WV).\n\nThese are just a few example of the complex series of reasons that Trump and other members of the U.S. elite are pushing to get everyone in the U.S. back to work. The capitalists and politicians are of course concerned about the stock market and corporate profits, and it is important to critique them for [prioritizing profits over human lives and well being](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/03/capitalism-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-19-single-payer). This is an essential feature of capitalism, even during periods of relative stability. However, during a crisis the contradictions of the system intensify, and its logic is laid bare. It’s important to understand the complex dynamics at play and not oversimplify the situation. The maneuvers of the ruling elite not only show that they value profit over the lies of the poor and oppressed people—something which they have made abundantly clear long before this crisis—but also that they are deeply concerned about how this crisis will impact their power, both geopolitically and domestically. In other words, the U.S. elite’s response to this crisis shows not only their greed and callous indifference, but also the fragility of their rule.\n\n*For more of our updates, follow us on twitter (*[*https://twitter.com/revunitedfront*](https://twitter.com/revunitedfront)*) or check out our website:* [https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/)\n\n**About us: We're the Revolutionary United Front, a US-based revolutionary organization in the U.S. organizing in the Greater Boston, New York, and San Francisco areas.

Some countries have closed their borders and announced lockdowns. Thus, consumers are spending less on non-essential goods and services and delaying purchases. Then, they expect this to hit the top line of a few companies by a significant margin. A tech giant, set to face a considerable drop in revenue, is Apple. The firm makes the majority of its flagship product, the iPhone. Last December quarter, iPhone sales increased by 7.7% to $56.0 billion and accounted for 61% of overall revenue. With that, the demand for the company's new lineup of smartphones mainly driven the growth. However, on February 17, Apple unveiled a statement confirming that the firm will miss the quarterly guidance issued during the last earnings call. Also, Apple attributed the shortfall to a constrained iPhone supply and a slow production ramp-up in its manufacturing sites in China. These headwinds have the capacity to depress Apple's results beyond the current quarter.   \n\n\nTo read the full article click the link:  \n[https://profitixpedia.com/blogs/apple-shipments-fall-coronavirus-outbreak/](https://profitixpedia.com/blogs/apple-shipments-fall-coronavirus-outbreak/)", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1585835967.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_fuvt48", "title": "Covid-19 pandemic is ushering two important (positive) revolutions", "text": "those two revolutions are: insourcing, and WFH (work from home). \n\n1) **insourcing**: far more than Trump's trade wars, this pandemic has truly damaged the credibility of \"Outsource everything & your mother\". \n\n.\n\nNo, this does not mean China loses its pre-eminent position as the Factory of the World (FOTW).  China after all will always have far superior scale & logistical efficiency & political will to remain as FOTW.  However, it does mean that insourcing is now politically viable across the entire world: people and even capitalist corporations are seeing the true dangers of a) over-relying on just one country, b) and under-relying on your own home country.  Right now, insourcing our medical supplies & machinery are getting most of the attention (as they should), but soon our insourcing attention will turn to other important products in our society. \n\n\n(side note: one day, i dream of a world where our spell-check software recognizes \"insourcing\" as an equally legitimate word as \"outsourcing\".....FFS)\n\n.\n\nb) **WFH**: this is the big one.  Just think of what an enormous set of changes that WFH will usher into society.  here are some examples:\n\n- Less driving = downward pressure on gas prices; your cars & car parts last longer; roads & highways last longer; traffic (both personal vehicles & public transit usage) is less crowded; parking lots don't need to be so huge; less accidents, which means less insurance claims & less tragedy; better mental & physical health (sitting in cars is bad for you!); many people will realize they dont need cars & might give them up.\n\n- more family time = less daycare demand & expenses; stronger parent-child bonding; stronger couple bonding (for healthy couples) or higher divorce rates (for unhealthy couples); less home insurance claims (because many home insurance losses happen because nobody's home) \n\n- more home computer usage = higher demand for residential internet bandwidth (esp if streaming), higher residential electricity usage\n\n- more distance between home & work locations = cheaper housing (more willing to buy/rent a place that is much farther away from your job, so long as it's cheaper)\n\n- other effects: less contagion for common diseases like flu & cold; even school students could have the possibility of remote classes. \n\n(important note: the ability to WFH is a key differentiator between white collar vs blue collar jobs)\n\nso here's an example: imagine your white collar job is downtown, but your employer allows WFH 4 out of 5 days per week.  Why the hell would you rent inside expensive downtown, when you can get a much cheaper place 1+ hour away? after all, you'll only commute once a week!\n\nhere's another example: we've all seen those insane videos of Tokyo's trains being packed like sardines. but now, even many conservative Japanese corporations are forced into WFH...how awesome it would be if Tokyo trains lost 25% of its traffic, in an average workday? \n\n....thoughts?", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1586014994.0, "tickers": []}

The \"$10,000 Grant\" that all the policymakers were parading about has now been changed by SBA against the Cares Act to \"Up to $10,000 based on # of employees\" This significantly reduces the aid that sole proprietors desperately need and this was one of the intentions of the law makers.

Last friday. \n\n\nMy job is to assess risks and improve our organisations, it's based on several things : reliable data, statistics, prospective, disruptive change management and psychology. Those are the skills on my resume, but, in fact it's an easy job : being a sponge! Observing, listening, without plan or bias, and if you are lucky understanding and learning. \n\n\nAnd last Friday I really did my job and all the little elements fell in 3 unbiased reasons why my personal opinion is we should stop thinking about recession or depression. Since the 12th March I had the deep feeling that the world had change. It's now a belief founded on 3 key factors I hadn't seen in any reports (neither Eurasia group, nor bcg's nor anyone article or report so far) all the other points are valid, but my job and personal experience lead me to always look for root causes, and covid isnt the root cause of economic congestion.\n\n\nThose 3 little things are just unprecedented things, happening at the same time, in our modern world. One of those alone is recession material, but 3?\n\n\n- All our Western \"1rst world\" systems had been developped on one factor: since several thousand years now, human follow the rules if and only if their basic needs are guaranteed. That's Maslow's pyramid's base. \nThe most interesting with Maslow isn't the pointy figure everybody knows, its the text! \nAnd only few people read the text when there's a schematic. In short, every slight perceived threat on the lower level automatically drops you to this level. \nCovid does that. \nAnd everything in our modern west world is based on the given assumption were at the point or just below. \nClimbing back will take neither months nor years but decades. \n\n- Lloyd's of london closed its trading and underwriting floors for the first time in its history. We're talking of a first in 334 years. \nThat, more than all the volatility of markets we witnessed makes me believe covid did something no war ever did so far... It's a real life event that had a significant impact on finance. This isn't even meant to happen! That just goes against the concept of economics and worst : we witnessed the hand in action. Noone ever whitnessed Adam smith's hand in action, that goes against the concept of invisible hand! That will have repercussions. \n\n- The supply is a long chain. We're working hard since the 50's to polish every link, improving those one by one in a complete lack of coordinated effort. Yes but... This chain in its mere design is meant for accellerating, its concept is pulling the flux. \nSlowing down can't happen and when way less impacting events happened it took us years to recover. Today links are tearing or collapsing because of covid. Airfreight relies on goods flying below passengers, sea freight relies on boxes circulating flawlessly between countries. Global business relies on offer correlated to demand... Tail effects will take their toll. As i said my job is to evaluate risks and ensure they're dealt with, but my kind isn't allowed to dive really deep (and in the system as it was working, it would've been overkill). Most of us evaluate sustainability of our providers, the most advanced goes up to rank 3, and that's something I hadn't witnessed much. Here I'm affraid of the long tail, the small company making an essential component amongst hundreds of the white ink used to print my keyboard's keys letters... \n\nSo the only possible conclusion, when you take all those facts is: restarting economy as we knew it will be the costlier option, and odds restoring it to its former level are really low. \n\nI'm just sleeping better knowing that, because my job is to find solutions, the most effective ones, the quickest to deploy ones... And in this specific case, when you really look at the details to make the big picture (which is actually my job, despite being counter intuitive with the neurotypical way of dealing with reality according to neuroscience), there's no solution to restart and restore what we knew. \n\nThat means we finally have reached a world of endless possibles and we can design without constraints! \n\nWell I'm sleeping for now, that won't last! Egoes will kill this! At the top and at the bottom! Soon I won't sleep again, egoes will force me to deploy bad solutions in a desperate attempt to get back to what was. Because people don't like uncertainty, and possibilities. You can't assess what can be, only leaders do that, and there's not much of them, covid is proving that point. \n\nSoon my peaceful nights will be over, but I'm enjoying the perfection of this momentum. After all there's absolutely no way to forecast anything knowing 3 of the maybe 5 foundations of our civilization had been challenged. \n\nSo i'm really taking care to engrave all those seconds in my memory, this might be the last quiet and peaceful moment of my life, the quiet and calm minutes before the tempest unleash... \n\nAfter all \"It's not necessary to change. Survival isn't mandatory.\" as W.E Deming said. \n\nI'm a QA expert, my life isn't about processes, rules, audits and evaluations! I'm a QA expert my life is about applying philosophy in business and industrial world! To offer leaders the means to ensure their management will offer the means ensuring client satisfaction to their teams. \n\nI'm a QA expert, noone, ever can get the world I see! \n\nI'm a QA expert not an ingeneer, I don't design planes, I make sure they don't crash! \n\nI'm a QA expert I observe, I listen, and if I'm lucky I understand and learn. \n\nAs a QA expert my job is to make people imagine a solution and work hard to make it happen. Keeping in mind it's always easier to remind the solution than creating one from scratch. \n\nI'm a QA expert, whatever happens, no matter how good I am, Human factor will happen!", "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1586440239.0, "tickers": []}

It's a bet that a stock or market is going down.**\n\nAs it is ultimately a bet, it is a very attractive market for degenerate gamblers!\n\nIf the market price falls below the agreed-upon price, you make money.\n\nUniversa makes a lot of small bets and watches most of them go bad (hence the 95 out of 100 trades they lose money line).\n\nHowever, when one hits, it hits big...\n\n**For example, back in September 2008, when the S&P 500 was trading around 1200, Universa bought S&P 500 Index put options with a strike price of 850, due to expire late October.**\n\n**They were betting an “unlikely” drop would occur.**\n\n**They paid around 90 cents for those options. By October 10th, the S&P had dropped 300 points in a month. The options Universa purchased for 90 cents were now trading for $60 each. Universa cashed out of its position around $50, good for a gain of 5455%.**\n\nNow, as a reminder, this is a hedge - investors will have a relatively minimal percentage of their portfolio in Universa.\n\nEssentially, the fund is designed to make an absolute killing if the market crashes and therefore ensures that their investors have insurance if the market suddenly nosedives.\n\nSpeaking of diving, let's take a dive into the [Investor Letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/455607584/Universa-Letter-April-2020#download&from_embed):\n\nIn what has been a terrible period for many investors, this is what Universa investors were greeted with on the first page:\n\n**Based on your required invested capital at the start of the year, in March 2020 you experienced a 3,612% net return on capital; year-to-date you have experienced a 4,144% net return on capital.**\n\nSpitznagel then flexes The Risk Mitigation Scorecard, which showed that a portfolio invested 96.7% in the S&P 500 and *just 3.3%* in Universa's Tail Hedge fund, would have had a positive return in March, a month when the S&P dropped 12.4%.\n\nThe same portfolio - which eliminates the adverse effect on compounding from downside shocks - would have produced a 11.5% CAGR since inception in March 2008 versus 7.9% for the S&P 500.\n\n(CAGR just means Compound Annual Growth Rate)\n\nI mentioned eliminating the adverse effect of compounding from downside shocks, well this is crucial and he makes a great point here:\n\n**Due to the mathematics of compounding, the big losses are essentially ALL that matter to your rate of compounding, not the small losses - and** ***not even*** **the big or small gains.**\n\nThis goes back to Warren Buffett's wise words:\n\n**\"Rule number one: Never lose money**\n\n**Rule number two: Never forget rule number one\"**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoWI76Pu9JI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoWI76Pu9JI)", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "created_utc": 1586708423.0, "tickers": []}

Even the most brutal of slaveholders were therefore compelled to develop a sophisticated system of management that exploited the most human aspirations and fears of the people they dominated.  \n>  \n>Creating divisions between slaves was essential to this. Enslaved people outnumbered free whites in the British Caribbean. In Jamaica the ratio was higher than 10 to one, and on some big plantations it was about 100 to one. Managers therefore needed to divide slaves in order to rule over them. The slave trade from Africa provided them with one opportunity. As a manager of several large Jamaican sugar estates remarked in 1804, it was a general policy to ‘have the Negroes on an estate a mixture of nations so as to balance one set against  another, to be sure of having two-thirds join the whites’ (in the event of an uprising). The theory behind this was that enslaved people from one African ‘nation’ would refuse to join rebellions plotted by those  from others, or by creole (locally born) slaves, choosing instead to serve their white masters in the hope of rewards for loyal service.  \n>  \n>Privileging some enslaved people above others was another [effective](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144039X.2014.944032) means of sowing discord. Slaveholders encouraged complex social hierarchies on the plantations that amounted to something like a system of ‘class’. At the top of plantation slave communities in the sugar colonies of the Caribbean were skilled men, trained up at the behest of white managers to become sugar boilers, blacksmiths, carpenters, coopers, masons and drivers. Such men were, in general, materially  better-off than field slaves (most of whom were women), and they tended to live longer.  \n>  \n>The most important members of this enslaved elite were the drivers, responsible for enforcing discipline and work routines among the other enslaved workers. These men were essential to effective plantation management—a conduit for orders and, sometimes, for negotiations between white overseers and the massed ranks of field workers. They were also among the strongest [survivors](http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15720.html) of the system.  \n>  \n>The privileges conferred on the enslaved elite came in several [forms](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03071020500304627): better food, more food, better clothing, more clothing, better and bigger housing, even the prospect (in some rare cases) that a master might use his last will and testament to free them.  \n>  \n>…  \n>  \n>The various privileges extended to the enslaved elite helped to create a conservative attitude among some—keen to protect what they had gained. They also produced an aspirational culture, of sorts, within the slave community—a bleak and tragic shadow of the ‘American dream’ of independence and riches that motivated the slaveholders. Those slaves who lived long enough and were not physically or psychologically broken by plantation work could aim to join the ranks of the skilled, privileged plantation elite. …  \n>  \n>…  \n>  \n>And their stories remind us that they were all trapped. However complex and divided the slave community, however many people we find who were able carve out precarious positions of relative comfort, we find them struggling to live within a system designed to promote disunity, anxiety and fear. …\n\nI couldn’t help but notice how our socioeconomic and political systems resemble this:", "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "created_utc": 1587682914.0, "tickers": [["COO", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_g8amaj", "title": "Social Capital 2019 Annual Letter", "text": "First for some context, Social Capital was founded in 2011 by former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya, whose net worth is *not* $1.2BN (it's many multiples of this according to Chamath).\n\nThe venture fund invested in a range of companies over the years, perhaps most notably of which was their investment in Slack.\n\nIn mid-2018, they closed to outside capital and became a technology holding company.\n\nAccording to Chamath, this decision was made in order to take a more long term approach and avoid the perils of the short term fee generation game that is prevalent in the venture capital industry.\n\nAs always, Chamath provides some interesting insights in the [Letter](https://www.socialcapital.com/annual-letters/2019).\n\n**Part 1/5 - Modern Gilded Age:**\n\nFirst off, Chamath makes the argument that we are currently in the later stages of a modern Gilded Age.\n\nThe Gilded Age was an era of rapid economic growth in the United States from the 1870s to around 1900.\n\nDuring this period there was rapid economic growth, wage growth, immigration and expansion of social programs.\n\nThe major industry of growth was the railroads, and a class division started to emerge with the 1% owning more than 25% of all property and the bottom 50% owning less than 4%.\n\nChamath argues that there are many similarities between the Gilded Age and today - both economic and societal.\n\nBut what came of the Gilded Age?\n\nWell, the excesses and lopsided nature of the Gilded Age ushered in the Progressive Era, which was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States that spanned the 1890s to the 1920s.\n\nAs well as addressing the problems caused by industrialising, urbanisation, immigration and political corruption, the Progressive movement also sought regulation of monopolies (trust busting) and corporations through antitrust laws.\n\nOf course, Chamath is not the only high profile investor to highlight the [importance of looking to the past for lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5LqCAtNJJ4).\n\nChamath highlights the rise of populism and the increasingly loud calls for change.\n\nTherefore, in this context, the last few years seem very much akin to the beginning of the end of our modern Gilded Age and the beginning of a new Progressive Era.\n\n**Part 2/5 - Tech Regulation:**\n\nThe question is: which companies will be broken up and when?\n\nDrawing on the comparison with the Gilded Age, Chamath states that the only way to effectively reign in Big Tech is via trust busting.\n\nHe expects Big Tech to be broken up within the next 5-10 years, with Facebook being first on the list.\n\nChamath also highlights the importance of making sure that Big Tech doesn't find a way of helping write the regulations such that they can promote and cement their monopoly.\n\nMoreover, Chamath describes the value created by Big Tech as an increasingly decaying function, while the need for true progress is increasing.\n\nThe combined R&D budgets of Big Tech total more than $600BN in the last decade.\n\n\"Big Tech promised to change the world and eradicate its evils, but it's clear that it isn't happening as they seem more focused on protecting their monopolies than advancing humanity.\"\n\nFor some context, the cost of the *entire* Apollo program was $25BN (or around $150BN in today's dollars). However, Big Tech spent $75BN on R&D in *2018 alone*.\n\n**Part 3/5 - The Market:**\n\nChamath then gives his take on the market, stating that central banks have exhausted their ability to meaningfully manage inflation, in either direction, but that doesn't mean that stock prices won't continue to go higher via unnecessarily cutting rates and flooding markets with money.\n\n\"Our simple framework is this: as money gets cheaper, the credit markets continue to expand because CEOs become motivated to artificially boost Earnings Per Share. They do this by buying back stock, seek bad acquisitions, make poor capital allocation decisions or avoid taxes. All enabled by borrowing massive amounts of essentially free money. It shouldn’t surprise you to know that these decisions also result in ever increasing CEO pay.\"\n\nBasically, Earnings Per Share is net profit/number of outstanding shares - so when companies buyback their own shares the number of outstanding shares decreases and therefore the denominator decreases and therefore Earnings Per Share increases.\n\nNow because many CEOs have bonuses that are tied to hitting a certain Earnings Per Share, this leads to an obvious incentive for corporations to buyback their own stock.\n\nIt is little wonder that Corporations are the dominant source of equity demand.\n\nIn the words of Charlie Munger:\n\n\"Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.\"\n\n**Part 4/5 - VCs:**\n\n\"VCs are increasingly motivated by the incentives of up-rounds, bigger funds and fee-based compensation. The flood of fast money has created a surfeit {pronounced surf-it} of these overnight practitioners with questionable sources of capital and even more questionable backgrounds.\"\n\n\"Big Tech raised a total of $1.345BN in venture capital before going public of which $1.3BN was Facebook alone. This means that Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google raised less than $45MM *combined* before IPO. Even on an inflation adjusted basis, this is incredible and tells something very important about a raft of today's startups.\"\n\n**Part 5/5 - Performance:**\n\nIt's safe to say 2019 was a pretty good year for Social Capital.\n\nThe returns in 2019 lifted their inception to date performance by more than 350bps.\n\nSince inception in 2011, they have compounded their money 997%, beating the S&P 500 (with dividends reinvested) by more than 3 times.\n\nIn 2019, they generated more than $1.7BN in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nChamath states that liquidity will be increasingly important over the next few years.\n\n\"Selling, when appropriate, and generating cash in a thoughtful way seems to be a prudent decision for the next several years.\"\n\nIn 2019, they completed two transactions:\n\nThe first was an investment of more than $500MM into Virgin Galactic, thus creating the first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company.\n\nChamath is tight lipped about the second company, but describes it as \"an acquisition of a venture backed company that had raised almost $100MM of traditional VC money.\"\n\nIn the Letter, Chamath compares the first 8 years of Social Capital to the first 8 years of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nHowever, [even Chamath agreed that the Berkshire Hathaway comparison was slightly misleading](https://twitter.com/bornaVC/status/1237181119277088768) \\- as the ratio of Berkshire Hathaway performance to the S&P 500 was around double the ratio of Social Capital to the S&P 500 over their respective periods.\n\nNonetheless, still pretty good!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJN68wt4pk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJN68wt4pk)", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1587888271.0, "tickers": [["VC", 1]]}

Federal deficit could hit $4.3 trillion and over 20% of GDP this year: The Federal deficit was on track to be over $1 trillion without any additional spending for the coronavirus this fiscal year. Now with the $2 trillion CARES Act, the $484 billion relief package and $134 billion for the Families First Act, the CRFB also estimates that, “nearly $600 billion in additional deficit spending as a result of feedback effects from lower economic output, slower inflation, higher unemployment, and lower interest rates” will occur. \n\n3.

But i felt the underlying reason has to do with everyone focusing on investing their productions in China, i'm not saying it's China's faults, because it is what the rest of the world decided that they have the capacity & cheap labor to produce decent products.\n\nHowever the recent 10 years China has been aggressively expanding globally, and entering new markets, this might at first seem as a good thing for countries involved as they are investing, however it feels like unlike the western countries, China takes more than it provides to the local economy. For example, Chinese company prefer to hire workers straight from China, instead of relying on local workers (unless there is restriction), because Chinese workers are cheaper and believed to be more efficient & reliable (due to also being Chinese), and the Communist believe in contributing to the mother land, as such they try to keep their money back in china as much as they can, and these workers generally spend little in the local market, as most of them buy most of their things from China (even food materials), so the most they spend would be on rentals & fresh produce. Unlike western expats who spend alot of money to help with the economy and hire majority local workforce to offer more job opportunities.\n\nChinese companies (usually builders) would also often bring in their own cafeteria and import their own food materials, and of course raw materials, because simply it's cheaper. So they pretty much buy nothing locally. Most contractors are also Chinese firms unless they are forced to engage local companies, so what we see is Chinese companies coming into different countries and taking away job opportunities for local companies and people.\n\nWhat we see is more and more companies moving out of many countries and focus on China, because they pretty much have everything. Hightech R&D will be done in their own nations, this leave majority rest of the world with much less business opportunities. With less business opportunities comes less jobs, and with people out of jobs, what follows next would be recession.\n\nI'm not saying China is the bad guy here, but what they are practicing is something like Dracula, and unlike Developed nation, instead of helping local economies, they seem to drain them dry.\n\nCountries know that, but they still focus on China, even though they know they should start looking elsewhere, because simply they are just too cost effective, everybody just trying to hang on as long as they can, but it'd be too late.\n\nEvery country needs China, but China doesn't really need most of the countries. China shuts down, everyone suffers. Over relying on China has caused many countries to shrink in economy, and this Covid19 Pandemic is pretty much a nail in the coffin for many companies that is still contemplating on whether to close down or pull out. Countries need to start bringing their work back to their own countries so their people have more job opportunities, or at least invest in countries that can bring equivalent economy benefits in return.", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1588879687.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_gh8bja", "title": "Gold standard? Federal Reserve?", "text": "Gold standard? End the Federal Reserve?\n\nI'm pretty sure this has been debated before and asked a lot in this forum but pardon me being new here.\n\nI am a history major and have been trying to read as much about economics as I can during my spare time. I'm about finished with Gregory Mankiw's *Principles of Macroeconomics* and plan to read his *Principles of Microeconomics* soon enough. I have also read Thomas Sowell's *Basic Economics* and am about halfway through reading Henry Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson.* I have also recently seen Milton Friedman's *Free to Choose* and also plan on reading his works, as well as Friedrich Hayek and Frederick Bastiat.\n\nOne of the topics I really want to delve into is in regard to the merits of having a Federal Reserve and whether it is more beneficial to go back to a gold standard. I think that there is an economic consensus that the money supply has a great correlation with the level of inflation and the value of the dollar, as the more that is printed, the more worthless the dollar becomes, and the less printed it is, the more worth it becomes. Particularly also, fiat currency tends to be valued only in, so, far, as there is confidence in the financial systems.\n\nFor this reason, there seems to be two issues and questions at hand. The first one is if it would be more beneficial to go back to a gold standard? I understand that there are various ways in which this could occur. This could include going back to the physical use of gold as money, pegging the dollar back to gold, or begging it to some other commodity such as Bitcoin. The purpose of any of these approaches is to control the money supply by something that is finite and hence limited in nature.\n\nThis seems to solve the problem of controlling the quantity of the dollar. Some have criticized the gold standard due to the overly restricted circulation of currency that has historically led to deflationary, as opposed to inflationary periods, which could be just as devastating as inflationary periods.\n\nThe second question and problem concern the Federal Reserve. To what extent is it beneficial to have a Fed? Should the Fed be reconstructed, and or more heavily regulated? Should we outright do away with the Fed? Or should the Fed be kept the way it is? On the one hand, it makes sense in theory to have an institution such as the Fed to help regulate banks, ensuring that things such as bank runs, and or banking disasters are preventing. It also seems sensible in theory to have an institution such as the Fed, which is independent of the government, to help in coordinating monetary policy.\n\nHowever, in practice, it also seems that the Fed has often been the cause of such disasters such as the Great Depression and the Great Recession by creating boom and bust cycles through arbitrarily changing interest rates, and through its various tactics at influencing monetary policy and controlling the money supply. A similar, yet different issue would be laws passed by the government encouraging risky lending such as forcing financial institutions, whether private or public to give out bad loans to risky people such as those who can't afford to take the loan.\n\nWould it not make more sense to simply let the \"invisible hand\" (the forces of supply and demand) to allocate the money supply and interest rates? If there is more demand for borrowing this will push interest rates up, as banks and other financial institutions would want to charge higher interests and they would ideally want to be careful as to who they are lending money to. If there is a greater demand for saving than lending, this would push interest rates down as banks would not want to give out as much money in interest and other financial institutions would want to encourage more borrowing.\n\nI would appreciate any resource recommendations whether they be books or other media platforms that you think do a good job at tackling any of these two issues.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "created_utc": 1589140707.0, "tickers": []}

The money was part of a $2 trillion relief package that President Trump signed into law on March 27th.\n\nThis criticism centred around the endowment size of the elite US universities:\n\n**Harvard has an Endowment of $40.9 billion, the largest in the world.**\n\nIn 2019, the endowment distributed $1.9 billion to the university, representing 35% of Harvard's total operating revenue.\n\nIn terms of asset allocation, the largest allocation was to hedge funds, which returned 5.5%\n\nFollowed by public equity, which returned 5.9%\n\nFollowed by private equity, which returned 16%\n\n**Yale,** [**thanks to David Swensen**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-09-11/david-swensen-made-yale-fabulously-rich-and-changed-endowments)**, has an Endowment of $30.3 billion.**\n\nIn 2019, the endowment distributed $1.4 billion to Yale, 33% of Yale's total operating revenue.\n\nIn terms of asset allocation, Yale is currently targeting a 30% allocation of the endowment to market-insensitive assets (cash, bonds, and absolute return). Absolute return just refers to value-driven and event-driven hedging strategies such as long/short equity, distressed investment and special situation investment. They are designed to have lower volatility over time.\n\nIt also seeks to target a 53.5% allocation to illiquid assets such as venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, and natural resources.\n\n**Stanford has an Endowment of $27.7 billion.**\n\nIn 2019, the endowment distributed $1.3 billion to the university, representing 22% of Stanford's total operating revenue.\n\nIn terms of asset allocation, it is mainly Private Equity, Absolute Return and International Equity.\n\nPrivate Equity refers to investments in private companies, ranging from startups all the way up to leveraged buyouts.\n\n**Princeton has an Endowment of $26.1 billion.**\n\nIn 2019, the endowment distributed $1.4 billion to the university, a massive 64% of Princeton’s total operating revenue.\n\nIn terms of asset allocation, it is mainly Private Equity, Real Assets and Independent Return.\n\nReal Assets refers to real estate and natural resources, and Independent Return refers to hedge funds or, in superior Ivy League speak, investment vehicles that seek high absolute returns that are typically independent of broad market trends.\n\n**According to Henry Hansmann, Professor Emeritus of Law at Yale Law School,** \n\n**\"a stranger from Mars who looks at private universities would probably say they are institutions whose business is to run large pools of investment assets and that they run educational institutions on the side that can expand and contract to act as buffers for investment pools.\"**\n\nAs well as this, many top US universities were [implicated in the Paradise Papers](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/08/us-universities-offshore-funds-endowments-fossil-fuels-paradise-papers) for using offshore funds to grow their endowments.\n\n104 US universities and colleges were named in data from the law firm Appleby, with four of the top 10 schools by endowment named in the files: Columbia, Princeton, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nMost contentiously, some of the offshore funds invested in carbon-polluting industries, despite leading US universities playing a key role in the fight against climate change...\n\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\nIn July 2016, Northeastern University [announced that it would invest $25m of its endowment in clean energy and renewables](https://news.northeastern.edu/2016/07/11/northeastern-to-invest-25-million-of-endowment-funds-in-environmental-sustainability/), boasting that the institution was \"a recognised leader in sustainability practices”.\n\nIn April 2017, Northeastern [invited Elizabeth Warren to open its new $225m Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex](https://www.wbur.org/edify/2017/04/03/northeastern-celebrates-grand-opening-of-225-million-science-facility).\n\nHowever, despite the complex’s ideals and goals, which include seeking solutions to rising sea levels and pollution, Northeastern was one of 12 prominent US universities and colleges named in the Paradise Papers as investors in a hedge fund based in the Cayman Islands. The fund is a feeder to a subsidiary based in Houston, Texas, of EnCap Investments, a company that, since 1988, has pumped almost $20bn into oil and shale gas exploration and production.\n\nNow back to Harvard.\n\nWith such a massive endowment, some have claimed that the school [should use more of the fund to entirely eliminate tuition.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/a-push-to-make-harvard-free-also-questions-the-role-of-race-in-admissions.html?referer=&_r=1)\n\nOthers have argued that Harvard’s funds could be better used by [recruiting and educating more low-income students, rather than giving free education to their already relatively well-off student body](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-problem-with-making-harvard-free-2016-01-17).\n\nHarvard clapped back.\n\n[In their 2018-2019 financial report](https://finance.harvard.edu/annual-report), they stressed that the endowment does not give the school full financial freedom.\n\n\"There is a common misconception that endowments, including Harvard's, can be accessed like bank accounts, used for anything at any time as long as funds are available. In reality, Harvard's flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it is designed to last forever, which is crucial for an institution intended to serve generations of students and pursue research on big questions - questions that cannot be answered in one lifetime.\"\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 [axed the tax-exempt status of university endowments, imposing a 1.4 percent tax](https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Treasury-Department-Releases-Endowment-Tax-Draft-Rules.aspx) on realised income of universities whose investment assets top $500,000 per student. The IRS anticipates that about 25 to 40 institutions will fall under this definition.\n\nStanford are expected to face a $43 million tax bill, and Harvard are expecting a $50 million bill.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the endowment situation: are they just asset management firms with schools attached?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLXM-e8dmm4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLXM-e8dmm4)", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1589281621.0, "tickers": []}

Now that it's clear to everybody that spending isn't constrained by deficits, we've been able to lend / hand out money to companies / people. That's injecting liquidity into the system, but not always necessarily generating productivity in terms of goods and services.\n\nBy now, the consensus view seems to be that there will be irreparable damage to the economy, and that it will be hard to bring it back online the way it was. Which means that, left alone, millions of people will remain unemployed and not spending. Since one man's spending is another one's income, this will slow down recovery. One can address that via unemployment subsidies, which would be costly and generate again little productivity.\n\nBut if spending is no longer a constraint, there might be better uses for that new money. The government could stimulate the economy with large infrastructure projects instead, which would generate massive amounts of paid jobs, fuelling again a healthy middle class able to spend and reignite the services sector.\n\nOne amazing use for that productivity would be **massive nation-wide renewable energy projects**, which would serve multiple goals:\n\n* Reduce dependency on foreign countries and fossil fuels\n* Creating a strong local industry which might even export tech R&D and products\n* Reduce unemployment by creating massive amounts of paid jobs, restarting spending\n* Significantly slow down climate change\n* Redistribute wealth somehow by decentralizing energy supply\n\nThe jobs created would have impacts at every level: rural areas with the ability to install solar or wind, the transformation of cities by equipping houses with solar and geothermal systems, new companies to service this economy, etc, etc. It would generate demand for both qualified jobs and general manpower.\n\nThis is the kind of spending America did with the highway system and the moon landing, with long lasting benefits to the country.\n\nIt feels like this is a perfect moment historically to be starting big audacious projects. This one specifically could be viewed positively by either party.\n\nSo, how do we make this happen?

As of yesterday, their share price hit an all time high of over $195, with a market cap around $36BN.\n\nClearly, this is a big coup for Spotify, who have nabbed the biggest name in the podcast world and one of the biggest stars on YouTube.\n\nHis podcast is the number one podcast in the world and gets as many as 190 million downloads per month. In fact, he was [Forbes highest-paid podcaster of 2019, raking in $30 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/02/03/crime-does-pay-my-favorite-murder-stars-join-joe-rogan-as-highest-earning-podcasters/#177986913773).\n\nOf course, this had led to a discussion about the value of content, specifically the value assigned to music and longer form content like Rogan's podcast.\n\nAccording to music writer [Ted Gioia, a musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights](https://twitter.com/tedgioia/status/1262930316253110276).\n\nIt is important to understand the context here:\n\n**For every dollar in revenue the Spotify earns, it sends 65 cents straight to the record industry.**\n\n**This caps Spotify's earnings potential, and means that it has a less robust business model than Netflix.**\n\n**For example, if Netflix pays, say, $30 million to make a new season of Ozark, that cost doesn't increase if it attracts more eyeballs. Media Rights Capital, which produces the show, makes the same money from Netflix regardless of whether the audience is 5,000 or 5 million.**\n\n**However, that is not the case with Spotify: costs** ***rise*** **with subscribers.**\n\n**Every stream will see another slice of the listener's monthly subscription fee go to the record label.**\n\nSpotify has a gross margin of around 25%, whereas Netflix has a gross margin of around 38%.\n\nSpotify has recently spent more than $600 million acquiring four podcasting firms, [including the $250 million acquisition of Ringer earlier this year.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-11/spotify-said-to-pay-250-million-for-ringer-in-podcasting-drive)\n\nTherefore, for a capped cost, Spotify can attract new listeners and potential subscribers. Also, the more time listeners spend on podcasts, the less money Spotify gives to the record labels.\n\n[The deal has raised comparisons with Howard Stern](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/05/19/the-new-howard-stern-podcast-giant-joe-rogan-inks-exclusive-deal-with-spotify/) and SiriusXM, which has made Stern a fortune.\n\n[In 2019 alone, Stern took home an estimated $93 million.](https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-stern/#5bedd7033dc7)\n\nIf video killed the radio star, did Spotify just kill the YouTube star?\n\nOr is this a smart move on Rogan's part?\n\nAfter all, it is expected that some clips will remain on YouTube for the casual algorithm viewers.\n\nRogan has previously been [critical of YouTube's demonetisation policy and censorship on the platform](https://reclaimthenet.org/joe-rogan-youtube-demonetization-policies/).\n\nOverall, Rogan is banking a guaranteed $100 million in an [uncertain economic environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU).\n\nAlthough some have commented that he is sacrificing the scale provided by YouTube, he may well still have his clips channel on YouTube.\n\nAs well as this, he is *licensing* his podcast.\n\nTherefore, if it fails, he has pocketed $100 million and can return to other platforms, thus generating more press.\n\nIf it succeeds, he has pocketed $100 million and will have more leverage in the next contract negotiations.\n\nNow that's a win-win.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the move?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TePsYC-RQQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TePsYC-RQQs)", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "created_utc": 1590173373.0, "tickers": []}

Some of that adaption will require higher educational attainment, or spending more time on activities that require social and emotional skills, creativity, high-level cognitive capabilities and other skills relatively hard to automate.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3/4 - Security:**\n\nThe digital nature of 4th Industrial Revolution technologies makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks that can take a multitude of forms, from data theft ransomware to the overtaking of systems with potentially harmful large-scale consequences.\n\nOrganised cybercrime groups are joining forces with their likelihood of detection and prosecution pretty low - [it is estimated that only 3 in 1000 cyber incidents see an arrest](https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors).\n\nAs well as this, the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution also offer expanded capabilities for waging war, which are increasingly accessible to both state and non-state actors.\n\nOn the frontier of emerging military technologies are those that [interact directly with the human brain to augment or even control soldiers](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-wants-soldiers-to-control-machines-with-their-minds-2019-12?r=US&IR=T).\n\nEven these are not limited to government military programmes.\n\nAccording to James Giordano of Georgetown University Medical Center: \"It's not a question of if non state actors will use some form of neuroscientific techniques or technologies, but when, and which ones they'll use.\"\n\nThe brain...is the next battle space\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 4/4 - Community:**\n\nThe final piece to this discussion is the impact that this will have on individuals and communities.\n\nDigital media is increasingly becoming the primary driver of our individual and collective framing of society and community, connecting more people than ever before but also *isolating* individuals in a maze of dopamine and polarizing propaganda.\n\nControversial or anti-establishment views can be further undermined by states and other actors willing to use new technologies and platforms to restrict speech.\n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is the first where the tools of technology can become literally embedded within us and even purposefully change who we are at the level of our genetic makeup. \n\nIt is completely conceivable that forms of radical human improvement will be available within a generation, innovations that risk creating entirely new forms of inequality and class conflict.\n\nThese emerging technologies will change what it means...to be human.  \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8D-wXs1PvE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8D-wXs1PvE)", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1590783079.0, "tickers": [["AI", 1]]}

I could name many german chains, but I suppose that wouldn't do any good here. \n\nBut you DO have Lidl in the US, right ? It's one of the biggest discounter chains here in germany (cheap prices, streamlined range of products).\n\nOf course I do know that everything that gets sold in retail first needs to be bought by the retailer, mostly through contractually fixated contingents, based on what product it is and how much of that is usually sold and needed in the area the store is in.\n\nBut how exactly do the mechanics work here ? \n\nBecause there are literally thousands of manufacturers, and there are a multitude of steps in the supply chains, especially when it comes to foods and drinks. \n\nFor example, there are foods who are heavily processed already in a factory (like ready meals, mixture bags for cooking specific meals etc.)  which is a highly industrialized process, which can be done by the big major companies themselves (Nestle, Kraft etc.), but there also things like fresh meat and fish, cutlery, cheese, eggs, milk, bread, pasta, rice, fruit, vegetables, beer, wine, spirits, you name it ...\n\nSome is seeded and harvested by farmers, some animals are bred for slaughter by farmers, chickens and cows must be kept and maintained for eggs and milk, bread is baked by bakers, beer brewed in brewery's, wine from winery's, mineral springs for bottled waters and so on and so forth ...\n\nI simply cannot imagine that all big retail chains would have supply contracts directly with the producers / farmers. Because if they had, how many freaking contracts would they have to make ? \n\nAnd these are almost always very small familiy businesses. And there are tens of thousands of them throughout the US (or most other nations, for that matter).\n\nThere are big industrialized bakery's, slaughterhouses, beverage filling plants and brewery's etc., of course.\n\nBut some things can hardly be ever fully industrialized beause they have to ORIGIN somewhere. As I said : Seeds must be sown, crops be harvested, pigs and chickens be bred. \n\nAnd the meat industry with their big meat-processing plants  turns the live stock into what we buy and consume, but they sure as hell didn't breed that pig themselves, you know what I mean ? \n\nIt's a little simpler with hygiene products and detergents, cleaners and household items, I guess.\n\nIn Germany for example the market for these items is very consolidated. Whenever you buy any cleaner, detergent or hygiene product there is a very good chance that it's a brand of one of 6 companys.\n\nHenkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Colgate Palmolive and SC Johnson. Those 6 basically share 90% of the market in these categories, so I suppose it is rather easy for retailers to make direct contracts with them. Plus, these things are made in industrail / chemical plants, most of it is artificial and no small time farmers are involved with the production of these items.\n\nBut with food and drinks ... I just don't understand.\n\nBig retailers sell all these products all day, every day. They're all in the store, they're all paid for at checkout, every customer takes specifically what they need and want. Everything gets digitally accounted for I suppose, but HOW does the retailer know how much they have to pay any individual supplier ? How much does Unilever get ? How much the meat-processing plant from New Jersey ? And how much does bloody Harold Jenkins, the self-employed crop farmer from Idaho and his family get ? \n\nHow can they possibly know how much of his valued labour is in the fucking loaf of bread they just sold for 79 ct ? How can this ever be fairly calculated ? Who pays Harold anyway ? Who is he selling to ? \n\nAre the suppliers / manufacturers paid strictly upfront upon order / delivery and strictly by allocated contingent ? Are they paid estimated lump sums ? And WHO is paid anyway ? Any manufacturer individually ? Or does it all get collected with wholesale marketers who have bigger negotiating power ? And if so, wouldn't that severely fuck over the small farmers and family businesses ?\n\nAnd then, of course, there are also those goods who are branded by the chains themselves, but as I understand it, these are often the same products as their original counterparts (often even produced in the very same factory) just repacked and relabeled, as a way to justify a discounted price. The manufacturers basically sell their excess at a calculated loss here, as a means to be able to run their plants and factories at max capacity at all times.\n\nAnd how do wholsale marketers factor into all this in general ? I know they deliver their stock at a win margin to gas stations and restaurants and business owners can go shop there directly. But do retail chains also get at least part of their stock from wholesales ? If so, that would be one more (rather redundant ?) link in the supply chain, no ? \n\nIt is more clear with bigger things like cars, furniture and electronics (both household and entertainment), because there simply aren't THAT many manufacturers and links in the supply chain. For example, Sony builds a certain line of LED-TV's in one of their plants and sells a certain contingent to any electronic retailer (or Amazon), who then sell it to the end-customer at a win margin, including VAT.\n\nBut how it works for retailers of daily necessities with their thousands upon thousands suppliers ... I'm just at a loss.\n\nCan anyone help me out there ?", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1590713308.0, "tickers": [["SC", 1]]}

I fully expect that the currencies that we now use will be printed to oblivion and be replaced by a series of government-backed crypto-currencies.  This is speculation of course but China is already heading that way.  That's just an example of regime change, there are other possibilities.\n\nCan anyone convince me that we aren't going to have an economic regime change?

{"name": "t3_gx02k0", "title": "The Truth about Warren Buffett?", "text": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha, Buffett-Falk & Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000 (in the 50′s).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.  \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you ain't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it, unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1591342603.0, "tickers": []}

Only December, but it is still crap, crap crap, crap.

Next year it will be 16 million, then 100 million.\"\n\nInstead, he was awarded a bonus of £400K and, although this was a huge amount for a young man from provincial China, it was far less than he was expecting - so he began planning his exit.\n\nIt was around this time that Xu began covertly accessing his colleagues' signals.\n\nAfter all, he would have a better chance of getting a good job elsewhere if he had ready-to-use signals to offer potential employers.\n\nHe landed two offers in Asia, but told his managers at G-Research nothing about his plans. \n\nOne evening, Xu cleared out his desk and placed a resignation letter on his manager's desk, and boarded a flight to Hong Kong. \n\nThe abruptness of Xu's departure raised immediate suspicions.\n\nThe next morning security personnel at G-Research reviewed video footage of his activities the night before, leading the company's attorneys to get an emergency court order.\n\n***To cut a long story short, G-Research then got the prestigious law firm Allen & Overy on the case, got a travel ban against Xu, who was reported to police in London, then arrested in Hong Kong in August 2014, extradited to the UK in December 2014, then sentenced in July 2015 to four years in prison.***\n\nBut that's not all: G-Research then used an ancient quirk of the British legal system called a private prosecution to find out who's seen the 55 stolen signals.\n\nThis allows the purported victim of a crime, if they are rich of course, to prosecute the perpetrator if the state fails to do so.\n\nAlthough G-Research were paying their bills, the lawyers spoke to the jury per the norms of private prosecutions, as representatives of the Crown - the British Government.\n\nIn January 2017, jurors founds Xu guilty of two of the five charged in the private prosecution, and the judge sentenced him to an additional 18 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***So the top hedge funds secure their IP like a military facility, have an informational advantage, have the world's best lawyers at their beck and call, have the Fed on their side if things go wrong, and normies think they can match this and be day traders?!***\n\nYes, of course people like [this dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbbsNsdwjLM) regularly beat the hedge funds and make a profit every day! \n\nThe vast majority of online courses are scams. \n\nDon't buy them. \n\n***Every dollar you save and invest is a soldier working for you.***\n\nDon't supply these scammers with ammunition to increase their ad spend and fleece more people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nIn conclusion, ***DON'T DAY TRADE!***\n\nThese hedge funds have intellectual capital and infrastructure you can only dream of.\n\nInvest, don't gamble.\n\nThese dopamine-inducing roulette tables scramble our brains' natural rhythm,\n\nDon't take on more risk than you can handle, and don't amble,\n\nHit that like button for the algorithm.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9JcFAadCVo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9JcFAadCVo)", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "created_utc": 1592906295.0, "tickers": [["G", 1], ["IP", 1]]}

The Warehouse-Lending Process shows the two stages of the warehouse-lending process. In the initial stage, shown on the left side, the mortgage borrower is approved for a mortgage from the nonbank originator, who funds the mortgage using a draw from a line of credit provided by a warehouse lender. Typically, the warehouse lender will only fund about 95 percent of the mortgage balance, so that the nonbank originator has some skin in the game for each loan. The collateral on the loan is the mortgage, and the nonbank in turn transfers the mortgage to the warehouse lender to collateralize the draw on its line of credit. **Since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, mortgage-collateralized warehouse lending has been eligible for accounting and legal treatment as repurchase agreements (repos).**\n\nNext, turn to page 16: **III.D.

{"name": "t3_hhpwfh", "title": "Property Tax Should Be Progressive; Here's How!", "text": "Tax progressivity is based on the assumption that the urgency of spending needs declines as the level of spending increases (economists call this the declining marginal utility of consumption), so that wealthy people can afford to pay a higher fraction of their resources in taxes.\n\nProperty taxes are computed by applying a flat rate (a certain percentage which varies place by place) to the currently assessed valuation of each parcel of real estate.   But a fairer, more progressive allocation of property taxes is possible and can be efficiently implemented.    \n   \nTo better implement property taxation, a multiplier should be used which takes into account two factors: the land area and the finished square footage of living space.   The multiplier is the average of two percentile values: the land area percentile and the finished square footage percentile.   \n\nExample: Suppose that a McMansion is built with 9,000 square feet of finished living space on 6,000 square feet of land.  We'll assume here that this is in the 99th percentile of finished living space (because 99% of properties have less than 9,000 square feet of finished living space), and in the 59th percentile of land area (because only 59% of properties have less than 6,000 square feet of land).   Averaging these percentiles together, this property's multiplier would be 79%, so this property would be taxed at a high rate.     \n\nHere are 3 examples of Tax calculations:     \n     \nTax = (Valuation - Exemptions) * (Basic tax rate) * (Multiplier * 2)    \n   \n*****     \n    \nAssume the value of the McMansion to be $500,000 and a standard exemption of $20,000, that the Basic Tax Rate is $25 per $1,000 of home value, and that the property does not qualify for any of the existing exemptions (blind, deaf, veteran, elderly, etc.).  Then   \n      \nMultiplier = 79% (as calculated above)    \n   \nTax = (($500,000 - $20,000)/$1,000) * ($25) * (0.79 * 2)    \n   \nTax = $480 * $25 * 1.58 = 480 * $39.5 = $18,960 per year, or 3.792% of the total property value     \n     \n*The wealthy person would pay $12,500 today; progressive taxation makes the wealthy person pay more.*    \n   \n*****     \n    \nFor a middle-class person, assume $200,000 and a multiplier of 0.5.

{"name": "t3_hqq0ip", "title": "Law school loan forgiveness bubble?", "text": "TL;DR: It seems that employment for new attorneys (both in the public and private sector) will be impacted by an economic downturn. A recession may also limit students ability to qualify for federal and school-based loan forgiveness programs, and may put constraints on law schools' budgets. Are current law school loan forgiveness programs more unstable than people think? And more broadly, is it likely that these loans themselves are risker than the government estimates?\n\nHi all,\n\nI am about to take out some loans for law school. This is the first time I've ever made this type of long-term financial decision and investment. An interesting question arose as I have been jumping through all of the loops for paying tuition.\n\nDoes anyone have a sense of the overall risk in the law school student loan market, and specifically the long term viability for the existing loan-forgiveness programs? My sense is that loans for higher education are almost always seen as a \"good bet/investment,\" although I'm not sure if given the current climate this is still true. I should preface this by saying that I do not have an econ background, so please forgive me if any of these reflections seem naive or misguided. \n\nJust to provide some background, the federal government currently allows easy access to loans for incoming law students. On average, across the country there are currently around 30,000 students graduating with 150,000 in debt per year ([https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-law-school-debt/](https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-law-school-debt/)). If those students go on after graduation to work in the public sector or meet certain income maximums, their loans are forgiven after 10 years. Many top schools also have their own loan forgiveness programs that work in tandem with the government's forgiveness program, where if similar criteria are met in terms of employment (public sector employment, and an income max), the students are not required to pay any interest after graduation. An additional (and important) requirement for both federal programs and schools is that students need to be employed in a job that is \"JD required\" - i.e. loans and interest will not be forgiven if you have low income and are working as a barista (I have nothing but love for all of the coffee mavens out there, and this is an unfortunate reality imposed by these lending and educational institutions). \n\nAgain, my knowledge of econ is very limited, but there are a few issues that I noticed while filling out my loan applications:\n\n1. There are minimal credit checks for taking out these loans. Students' income and ability to pay back the loans also varies significantly based on the quality of the school they go to, which is not taken into account when the loans are approved. \n2. Employment opportunities will likely change substantially based on an economic downturn from COVID. This article discusses financial instability in law school loan forgiveness after the 2007/08 recession ([https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the\\_law\\_school\\_bubble\\_how\\_long\\_will\\_it\\_last\\_if\\_law\\_grads\\_cant\\_pay\\_bills](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_law_school_bubble_how_long_will_it_last_if_law_grads_cant_pay_bills)). Given COVID, the impact on non-profit jobs will mostly likely be most strongly felt in 1.5-2 years, after current  grants to non-profit organizations expire and are not renewed. Right now most state, federal, and private grants to non-profits are \"locked-in\" through 2021, but after that, non-profits expect they will see cuts to their budget as grant money dries up (from lack of taxes for gov't grants, and lack of funds for private grants that depend on the market). This could limit students ability to qualify for loan repayment assistance through the type of employment, since most non-profits will not be hiring. Insofar as lawyering jobs at private are already competitive, and have already been limited by the COVID downturn, there will be restricted employment opportunities in these high income areas too. This restrains 1) graduates' ability to earn enough income to pay back their loans 2) their ability to be employed in a \"JD required\" non-profit lawyering position, since more students will not be able to qualify for the loan forgiveness programs if they have to get jobs outside the legal field.\n3. The COVID downturn may also place strain on law schools' budgets, since application rates (and the resulting tuition) may decline. Even if admissions is still robust, schools may have less financial aid to offer, requiring more students to take out loans. This is perhaps the least easy aspect to predict. This article discusses how admissions initially rose during the 2007/08 recession before beginning a multi-year contraction ([https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/law-school-applications-are-down-will-covid-19-spur-a-late-comeback/?slreturn=20200613183326](https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/law-school-applications-are-down-will-covid-19-spur-a-late-comeback/?slreturn=20200613183326)).\n4. There are multiple \"feedback loops\" between the federal government, loan servicers, and law schools. I've read that in financial networks these kinds of feedback loops can be a marker of overall instability, although truthfully I don't have any real understanding of why this is the case, or what level of complexity would signify risk ([https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-covid-19-coronavirus-violence-outbreaks-principles](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-covid-19-coronavirus-violence-outbreaks-principles))\n\nAnyone have any thoughts about this? Please feel free to provide any and all corrections on these points, additional links, or just some general reflections. Outside of its personal impact on me as an incoming student, it's sort of interesting to understand how all of these loan granting institutions spread their fingers through the economy.\n\nThis quote is taken from the link in the second point above, from the American Bar Association: \"The federal government’s gamble that higher education will continue to result in higher personal incomes eerily echoes Wall Street’s risky assumption that historical patterns in real estate values would carry forward forever and enable many sliced-and-diced mortgage-backed securities to attain AAA ratings.\"", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1594681718.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_hr86di", "title": "Coming Back Better than Before", "text": "&#x200B;\n\nThe Coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the countries that did not execute an aggressive and coordinated response. For the first time ever, the United States is one of those countries.\n\nOne major reason why the US has, by far, the most cases and deaths of any country is the clear lack of leadership at the national level. However, the pandemic has exposed many other systemic weaknesses in our country. The American political and economic structures that allowed us to be the world leader for the last century, appear to be working against us with this new killer disease.\n\nTo some extent, we have been the victims of our own success. The strength of business in the US allowed us to achieve a dominant economic position after World War II. This prosperity fueled an incredibly strong middle class along with enormous innovation and technological advancement.\n\nOver the decades, companies have been pushing for continuous growth at aggressive rates to keep their investors satisfied. Corporations have evolved techniques to maximize revenues and minimize costs. After all this time, that approach has created enormous inequality and stress on our society. Those weaknesses have been exploited by this pandemic, which has left tens of millions of Americans exposed.\n\nWith this vicious pandemic, we were forced to essentially pause our economy. Millions of jobs have been lost and people have suffered greatly – both medically and economically. Businesses are going bankrupt and our global trade system will be changed forever. \n\nOur challenge is to use this time to correct our underlying economic problems and come back in a way that benefits all Americans. Either we will make the economic inequality greater, or we can generate a rising tide that lifts all boats. The rich are poised to buy up bankrupt businesses and assets and build the next generation of winning corporations. After all the suffering and sacrifice, do the people of this country want to benefit from the eventual economic renaissance, or be sidelined forever as a cheap temporary labor base competing for whatever jobs can no longer be automated.\n\nWhen the next pandemic or other disaster hits, do you want to have economic security and medical coverage, or do you want to go through the type of stress and hardship that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing now. \n\nThe United States is still, by far, the richest country in the world. Let’s come back in a way that preserves our freedom and way of life, but allows for more than 10% of us to prosper. \n\nLet’s examine some of the economic issues we were facing before COVID-19, as they have been exacerbated since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Troubling facts before COVID-19**\n\n**Corporations over People**\n\n· Corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes – Individuals paid Income tax of $1,700B in 2019, while Corporations only paid 230B (only 11% of Fed tax revenue in 2019). That 2019 ratio calculates out to individuals paying 7.4X more than corporations. In the 1950’s, it was <2X.\n\n· Corporations had been using the majority of their profits to buy back their own stock or pay dividends to shareholders – increasing Executive compensation instead of improving the company, compensating employees, or saving for a “rainy day”.\n\n· Corporations use lobbying power and lax campaign financing rules to have an out-sized influence on our politicians, legislation, and policy.\n\n· Corporations can shop which states to locate in, extracting incentives and low state and local taxes at the expense of the communities they leave as well as relocate to.\n\n**Financial inequality**\n\n· Income inequality - Over half of American workers make less than $30,000 per year. 40M American families need “food stamps” to get by.\n\n· Wealth inequality - The median net worth was 65,000, and less than 15% of workers have a pension to fall back on – vs – 18.6 millionaires in the US (> 40% of global). Three people (Bezos, Gates, Buffet) have more net worth than the bottom half of Americans (160M people)\n\n· Billionaires and other Ultra High Net Worth Individuals control Political Action Committees (PAC’s) that influence elections and political behavior to the benefit of the top 1%\n\n**State inequality**\n\n· Small states have as much as 4x the per capita “voting power” for their residents than the largest states due to inequities in the electoral college system \n\n· All states have 2 US Senators, but California has 68x the population of Wyoming\n\n· NY, NJ, MA, CT, CA, and IL paid 319B more in Federal taxes than they received back in Federal spending (2015-18). VA, MD, KT, AL, FL and NC received 1,010B more from the Federal government than they paid in. (note: that the Fed government runs nearly a $1T budget deficit so overall the paybacks to states are 1.2x+ what they paid in\n\nThe pandemic has exacerbated these issues and viciously exposed the weaknesses and unfairness in our economic and social systems.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Troubling economic effects from COVID-19**\n\n**Corporations over People**\n\n· The majority of Federal bail-out money went to Corporations and businesses, and not to help individuals. \n\n· Many corporations that spent the vast majority of their profits on stock buy-backs while the economy was strong, received Federal funding despite their bad business judgement. They reaped the reward, but didn’t take responsibility for the risk they took. If it is capitalism, there should be consequences, such as bankruptcy, for corporations who make bad decisions.\n\n**Financial inequality**\n\n· The vast majority of “essential workers” make less than $11/hour with little to no benefits. They are asked to take the risk of disease for the rest of us with very little financial benefit, and inadequate safety equipment and testing. \\[Note: Minority populations are much more affected, but the subject of racial inequality is so huge and important that I will not attempt to go into that dimension here.\\]\n\n· Tens of millions of American workers are now unemployed, with very unknown prospects for getting back to work again. \n\n· With higher unemployment going forward, there will be downward pressure on wages for those who can keep their jobs.\n\n· The wealthiest people who have cash to invest will buy up valuable assets and profit from this economic collapse. \n\n**State inequality**\n\n· Weak Federal response to testing, tracing, and PPE not only created an environment where the United States has dramatically more COVID-19 cases and deaths than any other country in the world, but the State governments had to fend for themselves and pay inflated prices for whatever they could purchase.  In addition, unemployment and other benefits to individuals and families are paid by the State with little to minimal support from the Federal government.  With the concentration of cases in NY and NJ early on, those states had to absorb the most cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can we use this painful and terrible disruption to change things for the better? Here are some principles and objectives that the majority of Americans can get behind and demand get done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Put People over Corporations** \n\n· Tax reform for Corporations – eliminate tax loopholes and reform the corporate tax structure so the Federal government takes in at least 1 corporate tax dollar for every $2 dollars paid in individual income tax. (Some areas of select focus should be eliminating overseas tax shelters and strictly limiting carry forward losses.)\n\n· Eliminate stock buy backs – go back to the earlier rules where stock buy backs were not allowed and were treated as a form of insider trading. At a minimum, require all corporations to meet minimum pay and benefit requirements for their employees plus accumulate and hold enough cash to cover a year or two of operating costs before they can issue dividends or buy back any stock. \n\n· Eliminate tax breaks for stock options and awards. Strictly limit (or eliminate) the amount of executive pay that is tied solely to stock performance. \n\n· Campaign finance reform - Eliminate PAC’s and impose strict limits on donations plus maximum caps on election spending.\n\n· Lobbying reform – put strict limits on corporate lobbying as well as strong oversight and governance on politicians getting any financial benefits from lobbyists or the businesses they represent (including jobs after their terms)\n\n· Impose minimum corporate tax rates that all States must adhere to so companies can not drive down the state and local taxes they pay to rock bottom.\n\n· For future emergencies, ensure that individual citizens are protected as a first step. No one should go hungry, lose their apartment/house, or need to worry about medical coverage. Those basic individual needs come first – before any discussions about business subsidies, bail-outs, or economic stimulus spending.\n\n· When corporate bailouts are discussed, they must be in exchange for equity if the company has not saved enough cash to cover their costs for 1 year minimum. If the company paid dividends or did stock buy-backs, they would need to turn those shares over to the government before any government bailout money could be provided.  Bankruptcy will be more common when companies are not fiscally responsible, and the rights of workers will be protected above shareholders in bankruptcy settlements.\n\n· Institute a single payer Government run Health care system that covers all Americans - removing corporate profit that Private Health Insurance companies currently extract to reduce overall per capita costs. \n\n· Reform Oil and Mining policies and legislation. The taxpayers need to get a much larger stake in resources that are extracted from American soil. The US should consider nationalizing the Oil industry, or, at least, setting up a sovereign fund similar to what Norway has. All other mining businesses need to be similarly treated.\n\n· Basic utilities such as water and power should be nationalized. Utilities should be run for safety and efficiency and not a source of profit generation for corporations.\n\n**Reduce financial inequality**\n\n· All US citizens will get medical coverage as a basic right.\n\n· The minimum wage will be raised to $15/hour and adjusted for inflation going forward.\n\n· Estate Tax reform, including a requirement that all accrued investment capital gains are paid upon a person’s death before passing down as inheritance. \n\n· US corporations will bring manufacturing and outsourced jobs back to the US. This will be accomplished via tax penalties and incentives in additional to government oversight on the outsourcing of critical / essential / strategic industries. \n\n· The US government will shift domestic spending to programs and projects that increase jobs and improve people’s everyday lives. Focus will be on capital improvements and good paying jobs with benefits that bring value to our society.\n\n· The US government will also focus on future job creating technologies by increasing investment in Research and Development and protecting the Intellectual Property (IP) that is created – including giving the government a financial stake in future profits for projects that have been invested in, as well as not allowing other countries to gain the IP without adequate financial compensation. Focus on innovation, which has traditionally been a powerful differentiator for the United States but is now languishing. Recognize that social media and similar technologies that focus on diverting attention to drive ad revenue are not actually advancing our society.\n\n· Campaign finance reform. Eliminate PAC’s. Cap individual donations. Limit total spending allowed for campaigns. Elections should not have to be a multi-billion dollar media circus.\n\n· For future emergencies, policies need to be in place to call out what jobs are considered essential and then pay those people a bonus in line with the risk they are being asked to take for the public benefit. This should be one small part of a pandemic plan that is well documented and ready to be executed instantly and without partisan bickering.\n\n· As part of pandemic planning, the Federal government will need to be responsible for subsidizing the state unemployment pools to cover the increased costs due to government action.\n\n**Fairness across the States of our Nation**\n\n· The electoral college system must be eliminated. The US needs to enforce 1 person 1 vote.\n\n· The role of the Senate needs to be reformed, with less power due to the inherent inequality of a system that gives low population States so much more per capita voting power.\n\n· Every state should get back no more/less than 10% +/- back in Federal spending than they paid in through the Federal income tax of their residents. Any deficit spending by the Federal Government must also be allocated back to the states in proportion to the federal taxes paid by the people in that state.\n\n· A pandemic plan (and other emergency plans) must be in place with funding to keep it current, actionable, and best of breed. Politics should be removed with quantifiable, fact-based rationale for when and where money is spent. State governments need to be compensated for their excess costs and individuals must be protected above businesses. The plan would define everything required to immediately execute testing, tracing, PPE manufacturing, etc. as appropriate, in a nationally coordinated manner. States should not have to compete for assistance.\n\nThese types of reforms will be hard to do in our current political climate, but we must demand bold change in order to fix the broken, corrupt, rigged system that has obviously failed us all. Corporations and Billionaires have gotten their way for many decades, but they got extremely greedy and took it too far. Now we need to try a different approach – a fair, balanced, humane, democratic approach that puts people’s quality of life ahead of the desires of a greedy few.", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1594755092.0, "tickers": [["NC", 1], ["IP", 1]]}

Unemployment is widespread, and all the economies are striving to stay afloat, while also trying to curb the spread of the virus. Lockdown with strict measures is being implemented across the world, which has frozen the operations of a lot of organizations.\n\nAmid this global crisis, Singapore is hit by a major economic downfall in the second quarter as results Singapore slumps into recession. The Q2 FY2020 GDP shrank by as much as 41.2% as per the reports of Ministry of Trade and Industry, Singapore.\n\nThis massive blow in the figures is attributed majorly to the shrinking of the construction sector in Singapore. The construction sector almost vanished with a decline of 95.6% in the second quarter, while the manufacturing sector was down by 23.1% on-quarter.\n\nIn an official statement by the Singapore Government, the government stated that this decline in the economy was due to the Circuit Breaker (CB) measures that were implemented from 7th April to 1st June to control the spread of Covid-19 virus. These measures included the suspension of several non-essential services, which also included the closing down of many workplaces.\n\nWhile construction and manufacturing sector have faced a major hit, service sector too saw a contraction of 37.7% on-quarter. Among the other services, tourism-related services like accommodation, airfare, have been severely affected due to the travel restrictions across the globe.\n\nThe economy of Singapore, free, competitive and innovative in nature was largely dependent on the trade. Because of the disruption of supply chain globally due to the lockdown and other restrictions, the economy has had a major hit.\n\nEven then, there has been a substantial rise in the activities in the third quarter.

{"name": "t3_hvv7bp", "title": "The Federal Reserve", "text": "The Federal Reserve. The Fed.\n\nA source of numerous memes.\n\nA topic that has recently reached the critical mass of mainstream consciousness.\n\nA question that always lingers in the air is...who controls the Fed?\n\nBefore we can answer that deep question we need some context: what does the Fed do?\n\nOfficially...and unofficially.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOfficially, the Fed has four main responsibilities:\n\n1. Conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices.\n2. Supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers.\n3. Maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets.\n4. Providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, U.S. financial institutions, and foreign official institutions, and playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payments systems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”***\n\nThose are the words of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.\n\nUnofficially, the Fed enriches the top 0.1% in a process known as the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), which basically states that money printing itself increases inequality via asset price inflation.\n\n***Moreover, we currently have a situation whereby corporations run by executives with HUGE stock packages borrow money from Fed-fed banks for roughly free, buy back stock - thus boosting its price, then sell their own shares, using the proceeds to \"diversify\" into other assets (namely other stocks), expecting the Fed to keep the asset-inflation scheme going indefinitely.***\n\nThe recent spate of bailouts has highlighted the severity of the situation.\n\nThe Fed's policy of subsidising interest rates has incentivised corporations to borrow cheap money and buy back shares instead of saving cash for a rainy day.\n\nThe executives pocketing multi million dollar bonuses via this financial engineering should be chastised, but ultimately it is the Fed that facilitates this - just like it was the Fed who incentivised greedy bankers leading up to the '08 mortgage crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo understand who controls the Fed, we must go back to the Fed's formative years.\n\nThe year is 1910.\n\nThe month is December.\n\nSenator Nelson Aldrich was a prominent American politician and a leader of the Republican Party in the United States Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1911.\n\nAs an aside, his daughter Abby actually married John D. Rockefeller Jr, son of the famous John D. Rockefeller.\n\nAldrich and six other men were about to embark on a journey to Jekyll Island, an island off the coast of Georgia, where there was an exclusive resort which counted the Morgans, the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts as members. \n\nThese six men were:\n\nPaul Warburg (a partner at the investment bank Kuhn, Loeb, and Co.);\n\nFrank Vanderlip (president of National City Bank - now known as Citibank - and a former Treasury official);\n\nBenjamin Strong (vice president of the Bankers Trust Company and the future founding chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York);\n\nHenry Davison (a partner at J.P. Morgan);\n\nCharles Norton (President of J.P. Morgan's First National Bank of New York);\n\nand A.P. Andrew, who coincidentally was an economics professor at Harvard where he taught FDR, who would later sign Executive Order 6102 (otherwise known as the Great Gold Robbery of 1933).\n\nAldrich chose the attendees for their expertise, but he knew their ties to Wall Street could arouse suspicion about their motives and threaten the bill’s political passage.\n\nSo he went to great lengths to keep the meeting secret, adopting the ruse of a duck hunting trip and instructing the men to come one at a time to a train terminal in New Jersey, where they could board his private train car.\n\nOnce aboard, the men used only first names to prevent the staff from learning their identities.\n\nFor decades after, the group referred to themselves as the “First Name Club.”\n\nA member of the exclusive Jekyll Island Club, most likely J.P. Morgan himself, arranged for the group to use the club’s facilities.\n\nMunsey’s Magazine described this exclusive club as “the richest, the most exclusive, the most inaccessible” club in the world.\n\nAccording to Frank Vanderlip:\n\n***“I was secretive, indeed, as furtive as any conspirator. I do not feel it is an exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.***\n\n***Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.”***\n\nThe bankers initially drafted the Federal Reserve as the “Aldrich Bill,” but when it came to Congress, they recognized Senator Aldrich’s name, became suspicious, and decided against passing the bill.\n\nTo make it sound more official, they decided to re-brand the bill as “The Federal Reserve Bill.” \n\nThree years after their historic meeting at Jekyll Island, The Federal Reserve Act was singed into law on December 23rd 1913, and with that a small group of bankers had the monopoly over creation of American money.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act was originally granted a twenty-year charter to the Federal Reserve Banks, however on February 25th, 1927, it was extended indefinitely.\n\nThis proved crucial, as the sentiment in 1933 (nearing the end of the original 20 year charter) was not exactly positive with regards to the Fed.\n\nNow the good thing is that, since then, the Fed have been held to account by [rigorous audits and comprehensive investigative procedures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqM2tFOxLQ)...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn June 4th, 1963, US President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110, authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates.\n\nThis was the first of a series of moves to take control of US money back from the Federal Reserve by giving greater power to the Treasury.\n\nOn November 22nd, 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1861 was the beginning of the Civil War.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was short of money to finance the North's war effort and went to the bankers of New York, who agreed to lend him money at interest rates varying from 24 to 36 percent.\n\nLincoln refused, but he still needed to solve his money problem.\n\nColonel Dick Taylor came to the rescue and put the solution to him:\n\n***“Just get Congress to pass a bill authorising the printing of full legal tender treasury notes, and pay your soldiers with them, and go ahead and win your war with them also.”***\n\nThis is what Lincoln did: and on February 25, 1862, Congress passed the first Legal Tender Act, which authorized the issuance of $150 million greenbacks.\n\n(These Treasury notes were called “Greenbacks” by the people because they were printed with green ink on the back.)\n\n***Lincoln called these Greenbacks “the greatest blessing the American people have ever had.”***\n\nA blessing for all, except the bankers, since it was putting an end to their racket (i.e. the stealing of the nation's credit and issuing interest-bearing money).\n\nSo they did everything possible to destroy these Greenbacks and sabotage Lincoln's work.\n\nLincoln said:\n\n***“I have two great enemies, the Southern army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. And of the two, the bankers are my greatest foe.”***\n\nLincoln was re-elected President in 1864, and he made it quite clear that he would attack the power of the bankers once the civil war was over. The civil war ended on April 9, 1865...\n\nLincoln was assassinated six days later, on April 15.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe central bank in each country is the legal entity that manages the nation’s money supply and can lend money, with interest of course, to the government and other private banks in the country. This is how it all works:\n\n1. When the government needs more money, they ask the treasury department for money by issuing an IOU or government bond, which is a bond issued by the national government with a promise to pay periodic interest payments and to repay the face value on the maturity date.\n2. The Treasury (an executive department of government) receives the bond from the government and forwards it to the nation’s Central Bank.\n3. The Central Bank (a privately owned bank and the entity that owns the monetary system of the nation) then writes a check to the commercial banks in the country for the value of the bond and authorises them to create this new money. This central bank, of course, just invents money out of thin air.\n\nFor more clarity, we can refer to \"Putting it Simply\", released in 1984 by the Public Services Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\n\n***“When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our accounts to cover the check. But when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money”***\n\n4. The commercial banks then type numbers on a screen and create money out of nothing. At this exchange at the private banks, money is *officially* created and can be used to pay government bills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother part of this money creation system happens at the commercial banks.\n\n***Every time you take out a loan, banks simply type in some numbers digitally in your account and charge you interest on it. So basically, each time the bank makes a loan, the bank doesn’t use other people’s deposited money to loan to you. It creates new money by typing digits into a computer.***\n\n***97% of all money is generated that way. Only 3% is the physical paper cash and coins that we carry.***\n\nMoreover, commercial banks lend out up to 10 times more money than they actually have in reserves; a practice known as fractional reserve lending.\n\nTo demonstrate how absurdly the system is currently leveraged, that [reserve requirement has recently been cut to zero.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm) Yes, zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo who controls the Fed?\n\nWell, an international Cartel of Central Bankers, more ruthless and more intelligent than Escobar or El Chapo ever were.\n\nA Cartel who have effectively perfected a form of modern slavery; with debt taking the place of chains...and Central Bankers playing the role of Masters.\n\nI close with a quote from Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's father:\n\n***\"Even if it were desirable, America is not strong enough to police the world by military force. If that attempt is made, the blessings of liberty will be replaced by coercion and tyranny at home.\"***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9wgvTos04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9wgvTos04)", "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "created_utc": 1595429722.0, "tickers": [["HUGE", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_hxv21e", "title": "International Trade Question", "text": "Hello, me again!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was arguing with the same libertarian friend as last time about whether or not we need international trade regulation and I thought you all would be able to help me out here. Basically, I was wondering if my arguments were valid/what I'm missing. Here goes:\n\nLib: \"We don't need international trade rules, trade is between one entity and another. Trade rules only serve to limit competition because they restrict who I can buy from and where I can get stuff. A perfect example of this is the American drug market. Insulin is radically expensive in the United States but shockingly cheap in Canada and Mexico. Now, as I've explained to you before, this is because the US effectively subsidizes their drugs. Because other countries have Universal Health Care, drug companies can't make a profit on them, so they offload all their costs of production and distribution here as well as their need to get a profit. This is why drugs are so expensive. Now, that's a side topic. Imagine if we didn't have rules that prevented me from buying drugs abroad. Prices were equalize overnight because now the American market is every market, and drug producers can't offload all costs on us.\"\n\nMe: Ok, so first off this fails to address a key reason we have international trade treaties: disputes and harmonization. If I want to sell a product in Canada, I obviously need to follow their rules. However, it is cheaper for me to have one set of a machinery and one set of tools. However, if Vietnam has completely different regulations, I will need another set. That's expensive and ridiculous. Plus, how do you resolve disputes? What court do you use?\n\nLib: That question shows your inexperience. In practically every contract, the court to use is decided ahead of time. Plus, Canada may have more stringent rules than Vietnam, so a country should just comply with the more stringent rules and they're bound to be fine.\n\nMe: Ok, what if the rules contradict each other? So, say that Canada required that the maple trees I'm getting sap from must be from quebec, but vietnam says that they must come from Illinois (this is a plainly ridiculous example and completely made up, but I couldn't think of anything of the top of my head cause i don't spend my free time memorizing maple syrup regulations for countries around the world). Plus, complying with more stringent regulations is expensive, which can easily screw over poor countries.\n\nLib: Ok, but again these regulation disputes can be worked out in a contract between two trading parties.\n\nMe: Imagine how difficult it would be to sign so many individual contracts. It would be much better to do that on a national level.\n\nLib: That's why I advocate bilateral treaties\n\nMe: But those come up with their own set of issues. It's easy for big countries to bully little countries and treat certain countries better. That can easily lead to insulation of domestic firms from foreign competition.\n\nWas I right in the end? Was he right? Is there something else I could've said, or that he could've said? Thanks!", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1595714214.0, "tickers": []}

I want models that will make money while I sleep,” Simons said. “A pure system without humans interfering.”***\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\n***At the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.***\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to *why* these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\n***We are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.***\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator’s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman’s calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\n***The problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high: building a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.***\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\n***They have completely automated the process of signal discovery: they don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.***\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\n\n***The mathematics of efficiently processing that data are what matters.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n**The takeaway from this is the following:** [do not day trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9JcFAadCVo)**, you will get REKT.**\n\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI)", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1596267470.0, "tickers": []}

Unfortunately, she now owes the IRS $10 million.\n\n***Step 6:*** She decides to donate the painting to her local modern art museum. The trustees are happy to state it's value at $10 million. The IRS accepts the valuation and allows Alice to write of her $10 million tax bill. She is now a noted philanthropist, and she gets a wing of the museum named after her.\n\n***Step 7:*** Bob, on the other hand, isn't doing so well. He needs cash quick, but he can't sell his painting on the open market - because it isn't worth very much without John Doe manipulating the price.\n\n***Step 8:*** Bob goes to his bank and asks for a loan, using the painting as collateral.

{"name": "t3_i2ef1p", "title": "The Cantillon Effect", "text": "Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?\n\nWealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.\n\nThis rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.\n\nWhenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.\n\nWhen the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.\n\nAlso, those the very top are often diversified - thus even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.\n\nThe redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.\n\n**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about.**\n\nIn accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. \n\nIf it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.\n\nUnder modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.\n\nUnder this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.\n\nThis is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.\n\nIn a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.\n\nUnder central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.\n\nIn both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.\n\n**Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.**\n\nFor instance, the financial sector has contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.\n\nOne of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.\n\nIn a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited.\n\n**In other words, the phenomenon of asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.\n\nAsset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.\n\n1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.\n2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.\n3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.\n\nHence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.\n\nDespite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.\n\n**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs)\n\nSource: [https://mises.org/library/how-central-banking-increased-inequality](https://mises.org/library/how-central-banking-increased-inequality)", "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "created_utc": 1596384097.0, "tickers": []}

The suspension of visas would be in place till the end of this year and in the near future, we will decide on expanding the suspension or lifting it if needed, the *CNN* reported.\n\nThe proclamation implies that foreign nationals, dependants, and spouses that are stuck in India on an H-1B visa or even L-1 visas, do not hold a legitimate visa, including dependents, will have wait for the lifting of visas suspension until the end of 2020, *The First Post* reported.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration's announcement, anybody on an H4, H-1B, H2A, and J1 visa who didn't hold a valid visa as of 24th June would not be permitted to travel to the nation till December 31. \n\nThe H-1B visa permits US companies to temporarily employ workers from abroad in specialty jobs. The occupation will require a specialized degree or equivalent work experience for getting recruited. The length of a stay is three years and can be further extended to six years. When this period gets over, the visa holder will need to re-apply for a visa. \n\nThe President's announcement came as millions of US citizens applied for unemployment benefits due to the coronavirus crisis and its aftermaths, such as job cuts, fewer wages, businesses getting shut, economic crisis, etc. \n\nHowever, the new measures would imply that priority will be given to Americans for jobs and the people who don't have a valid visa as of June 23 and are outside the US, won't be permitted to enter the nation until December 31, 2020. \n\nIn addition, the official order that was marked by Trump additionally says that the H-1B visas will not be decided via a lottery system. The new guidelines would be in support of highly skilled workers.\n\n**Article Credit**: *The FirstPost/OneIndia /CNN /The Hill*\n\n [https://www.theworkersrights.com/embassies/2020/08/03/what-does-president-trumps-suspension-of-h-1b-visa-mean-and-how-will-it-impact-indians/](https://www.theworkersrights.com/embassies/2020/08/03/what-does-president-trumps-suspension-of-h-1b-visa-mean-and-how-will-it-impact-indians/)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1596527822.0, "tickers": []}

Perhaps someone with more expert knowledge could share their opinions?\n\nPost: \n\nThe wheel is not the car. Still sucks when you get a flat tire.\n\nThe thing I find frustrating/confusing when economists say that \"the stock market is not the economy\", is that retirement funds, especially in the USA, have a high degree of stocks in their portfolio. When the boomers cannot afford to retire, that has a significant effect on the economy.\n\nAlso, the ability for companies to grow, produce goods and pay their employees, is closely linked to it's ability to raise capital. Most companies find the capital they need to achieve scale by going public on the stock market.\n\nI think this saying is becoming popular now because of the disconnect between consumer spending and stock prices pumped up by the increase of the money supply. That increase is captured at the big bank level, who loan to big corporations, who buy back their own stock. But when the bubble bursts, the stock market will feel like it's part of the economy again.\n\nWhen our children are paying skyrocketing taxes to pay back the debt on this money printing catastrophe, that will also be the economy.\n\nI think a better term might be, \"Your Stake is Fake\". \n\n[source](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6696806645621698560?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6696806645621698560%2C6696810082887323648%29)", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1596668972.0, "tickers": []}

Almost the entirety of this fulcrum, from 3-months out to 30-years, is below 1%. How much further can this trend go? Long-term we’re headed for total yield suppression with full-on Japan-style yield curve control. But it’s not going to be a straight trend from here to there and we’re likely headed for a bump pretty soon…\n\n2-Falling yields (bonds up, yields down) have driven the stock/bond ratio to multi-decade lows. Its z-score (red circles) is at levels that have marked major reversals in stock/bond relative performance in the past. Stocks and bonds compete for capitam flows. A rotation out of safety and into risk might soon be underway.                                                                                                                                                         \n\n3- The bears who’ve been sitting on the sidelines of the equity rally off the March lows don’t understand the financial concept of relativity. Asset allocation is a choice of comparisons that contain a number of critical feedback loops. The rate of change in US Baa yields recently fell to its lowest level since 2003. These levels are more consistent with a major bottom in stocks, not a top.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hb8jrfyuuxi51.jpg?width=1234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fdc71f8f5fafdf69e2bceaca699ddfc9fe37ca9\n\n4- But as I’ve been pointing out the last few weeks, it appears there’s a major trend change brewing. The MOVE index (a measure of bond volatility) is at all-time lows. Compression regimes lead to expansionary ones. And there are some growing signs of important divergence. Here’s a chart showing 10yr Breakevens pulling away from UST 10yr yields.

{"name": "t3_ifg526", "title": "Why Must Money Inflate Or Deflate In Value When There Is More Or Less Of It In Total?", "text": "TL;DR Why does fictional money fluctuate in value, despite seemingly not having a need to.\n\nWhy does the value of currency fluctuate in the modern era? In the United States, a 100 dollar benjamin is worth exactly 100$. We all collectively agreed that this cloth bill is worth that much and can be exchanged for goods or services up to 100$. So if we say its worth 100$ why does inflation or deflation affect its true value? In the past when the currency was backed by a resource, usually gold, the available money supply, as a result, was much smaller and less fluid.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo when the next economic crash occurred and everyone came screaming to the banks demanding all of their money back, the banks simply didn't have enough gold to give to everyone due to fractional reserve banking, as a result, millions of people lost their fortunes and sent the economy plummeting downward into a recession.\n\nIn modern times, however, the VAST majority of wealth lies digitally on computer servers and the overwhelming majority of transactions also occur digitally via debit cards or credit cards.  Now a debit card has a few distinct advantages over gold, it's significantly easier to transport, it's very difficult to steal the wealth it possesses and almost universally your wealth is backed by the full force and faith of the United States.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo let's say another economic crash happens due to say oh I don't know the world's most lethal pandemic in almost a century. What happens when people rush to the banks demanding the value their plastic cards hold? Well one of 2 things really, either they A request the central bank to print them more money to give to said distraught customers to make them feel better or B tell the customers that their money isn't able to be handed over because it's just digits in a computer system but is still able to be spent as normal.\n\nDoes this cause the same issue to the economy the first bank rush caused when there wasn't enough gold to go around? I don't believe so, as far as I can understand it we as society trade our time and our labor in exchange for a unit of value, we then trade this unit of value for the goods or services produced by other people who are trying to acquire said unit of value so they themselves can perpetuate the cycle. In this type of system, people are able to specialize into different career paths that provide a far greater collective value to everyone involved in perpetuating the system than if everyone was forced to work as a burger flipper at burger king for example.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo if deflation (reduction in total number) of a currency can't directly increase the value of a set unit of value due to universal availability. Then all, that's left to deal with is the possibility that too many people acquire such a significant amount of said unit of value that they cease to participate in the cycle of value exchange. Or in other words, because they already have so much money they don't need to produce any goods or service in order to survive, so they cease to do so.\n\nThis, however, seems like a rather trivial problem to overcome, a simple wealth % scaling based tax combined with a unit of value ceiling would entirely eliminate this possibility from happening. Put simply tax those that hold large sums of wealth proportionate to the amount they hold/make and put a maximum limit to the wealth that can be accumulated by one individual. This would ensure that ALL members of society would need to CONTINUE to contribute to the larger economy moving forward while also having the benefit of new tax revenues available for the funding of more robust public services.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAt the end of the day perhaps,I am missing something critical in my analysis of wealth and value within a society but as it stands based off my current understanding I see no good reason a fictional currency we designated the value of should change simply due to its availability, beyond archaic systems of power perpetuation.

{"name": "t3_ikpsdb", "title": "Walmart VS Amazon, the next big online retailer (Walmart DD). Why my money is on Walmart", "text": "**Walmart Due Dilligence**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n\\- Partnership with Instacart\n\nRecently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \\[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart’s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.\n\n\\- Partnership with Shopify\n\nIn addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item’s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart’s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart’s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.\n\n\\- Partnership with ThredUp\n\nWalmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable’s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would’ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.\n\n\\- Google\n\nWalmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.\n\n\\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)\n\nWalmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.\n\nSince the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\n\\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel\n\nLet’s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO’s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.\n\n\\- Jet.com\n\nThe first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce.\n\n\\- Flipkart\n\nEver heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart’s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.\n\n\\- TikTok acquisition\n\nSome very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok’s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart’s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.\n\n**Walmart PLUS**\n\nWord is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year\n\n**2 Hour Delivery**\n\nWalmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.\n\n**5000+ US stores.**\n\nThis is Walmart’s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.\n\n**Some other interesting facts to consider.**\n\n\\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.\n\n\\- Walmart’s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%\n\n\\- Walmart’s expansion in Africa, India, China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nLet me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.\n\nWalmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.\n\nSources:\n\nInstacart:\n\n[https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010](https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry)\n\nShopify:\n\n[https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025)\n\nThredUp\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172)\n\n[https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438\\_6272369\\_7404214](https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438_6272369_7404214)\n\nGoogle:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/)\n\nMicrosoft

At fist look it seems US have better economics model than the other countries. But I do not think this is the case. US have unique location and history. They are protected from the competition by two oceans at east and west side. At north Canada because of the climate cannot support big enough population to be a competitor, and at south Mexico is a typical subtropical country, where is easier to develop the agriculture, and the industry struggles.\n\nAs history – the viruses brought by the Europeans killed most the native population: nobody really knows how many millions died. That freed an enormous area of land and resources.\n\nThe result is a period of peace without a precedent in the human history. Since the Civil war there was not a major conflict on the US continental soil. So more than 150 years without forced destruction of the economy. Meanwhile every other big country with temperate climate was destroyed multiple times by wars. I think this is in general the secret of the US wealth.\n\nNow let look at the present. How the US economy works, and why generates so much debt. Since the WW2, because of the stability – no wars, and the market – the only big economy that was not destroyed by the war, US dollar became the world’s reserve currency.\n\nSo now Fed counts on that to print money. Then the private banks and the federal government take that money and give most to private companies – that means private profits, bonuses and buybacks of shares. This is not a bad model in general. But in US it has several big issues.\n\nMany social services are privatized. And that makes them very expensive – as the price includes the private profits, bonuses and buybacks of shares. That creates whole private sectors in the economy that lay on the federal money. And if we add the constant attempt for growth of the private companies, that leads to debt spiral.\n\nThere is a paradox – if the US minimize the share of the private sector in the social services, so they increase the federal spending, the overall cost will be reduced significantly.\n\nThe lack of adequate social services and protection is the main reason why the inequality leads to conflicts and confrontation. Also that situation effectively suppresses and limits the opportunities for the poor, so their children also become poor and etc. And that strengthens the inequality through the generations.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "created_utc": 1599410519.0, "tickers": []}

For which it has been very scrutinized. \n\nThe entire strategy revolves around “herd immunity” without stating it outright and has been something that the Swedish population has grown to accept. The government here actually promotes NOT using masks, not stating at home if you think you have been exposed etc. ( the only recommendation now is that people 20 years and older should stay home if someone in their household tests positive for COVID, not that they are sick, but actually tested positive and they DON’T have a society-bearing job )  It has been very clinical and callous, almost sociopathic in a sense as the reasoning now is not about saving lives but rather saving the economy.\n\nSweden has avoided an economic collapse but has one of the largest death per citizen numbers in the world. \n\nIn a sense, people here seem very callous compared to the warm and emotional nature of the US population. I know that I am not an individual to my government but only a number. \n\n* the Swedish government promotes NOT using facemasks as it would be a logistical and economic nightmare, people would get scared and might stay home because of fear etc. It would better serve the economy if people carried on with their daily lives, working etc.\n\n* They indirectly promote that getting antibodies and getting sick is an advantage over locking the society as it serves the economy with only a more strict recommendation of people of very old age and comorbidities should stay home if possible.  \n\n* To put it bluntly - We expect people we have near and dear to die in order to save the economy. And whoever “ gets sick” is at his or her own fault for putting themselves at risk.\n\nHaving this as context;\n\nThe current US administration seems to have wanted to go with the same strategy as Sweden regarding the pandemic but has been met with an extreme amount of resistance by the US population. It almost seems like the US lockdown ( at least from a Swedish perspective ) was only implemented to apease the opposition and later again declaring that the economy would not survive if people did not work - again returning to the “ Swedish narrative “.\n\nThat last part might be extremely speculative but that notion has been passed around Swedish news outlets and discussed. With a primary argument that the US administration must have had a calculated plan to save the economy and that locking down over a long time would only “destroy the economy”. And that with such a giant apparatus that the US economy is, it just makes no sense locking down without a major reason. \n\nMy question now is, with Sweden’s growing economy compared to our neighboring countries economies failing - what could the US do in it’s current situation ? \n\nCan it save it’s economy by going the callous Swedish route ? \n\nCan the US “ survive “ without collapsing and if so, how ? \n\nI do not condone what Sweden has done nor do I have an opinion on it, as I am not an expert regarding this topic in any way.

{"name": "t3_j4dw87", "title": "The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation", "text": "**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**\n\nFirst off, let's set the scene.\n\nThe stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.\n\nEconomic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.\n\nThe correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.\n\nIn doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.\n\nHowever, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:\n\n*“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.\"*\n\nThe reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.\n\nNow, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.\n\n*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.\n\nWe are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.\n\nIn fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nInflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.\n\nDeflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.\n\nThat's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.\n\nWell, no.\n\nIf you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.\n\nAs the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. \n\nThis is why central banks fear deflation so much.\n\nHowever, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...\n\n**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**\n\nThe increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.\n\n[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.\n\nAll technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create \"supply side shocks\", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. \n\nIn the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.\n\nIt is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI\n\nAccording to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:\n\n*\"This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology\"*\n\nMoreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.\n\nOld legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. \n\nAs an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!\n\n**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**\n\nThe question is: how does this play out?\n\nIn the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.\n\nIn reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...\n\nOne could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:\n\n1. Divide and Conquer and\n2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)\n\nAs we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...\n\nSpeaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information. \n\nInformation feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.\n\nA fantastic example of this process is what has happened with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.\n\nIt's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).\n\nIt is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.\n\nTherefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.\n\nThe real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...\n\n**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**\n\nThe depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future.\n\nNow this will not necessarily happen straight away.\n\nHowever, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism is inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.\n\nFrom a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.\n\nEssentially, this means that the value of the network increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.\n\nAn asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.\n\n[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.\n\nOnly time will tell...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1601722777.0, "tickers": [["FREE", 1], ["AI", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_jdbpx4", "title": "Three Theories of Banking", "text": "There are three main theories of banking.\n\nBut what are they?\n\nAnd, more importantly, which one is correct?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1 - FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION THEORY**\n\nFirst of all, we have the Financial Intermediation Theory.\n\n***This is currently the dominant theory of banking, and states that banks are just financial intermediaries (i.e. they gather deposits and lend these out).***\n\nOK, pretty basic, makes sense.\n\nIt can, and does, however have significant implications.\n\nFor example, the Financial Intermediation Theory has had a significant influence on economic policy in the post-war era, specifically the attitude that developing countries could be helped by international banks who could provide missing domestic savings through their lending in order to fund economic growth.\n\nThis has resulted in a *massive* increase in foreign borrowing and indebtedness by developing countries since the second world war. As planned of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2 - FRACTIONAL RESERVE THEORY**\n\nNext up we have the Fractional Reserve Theory.\n\nThis was the dominant theory from around the 1920s to the 1960s.\n\n***It also argues that banks are financial intermediaries, but collectively the banking system creates money via the process of 'multiple deposit expansion'.***\n\nOK, what does this mean?\n\nWell, it is based on the following idea:\n\nWith a reserve of, say 10%, every bank would lend 90% of any deposit, which would increase deposits with other banks, resulting in a multiple creation of deposits in the banking system. \n\nSo the Fractional Reserve Theory states that banks create money collectively, but *not* individually.\n\nAccording to the American economist Joseph Stiglitz, \n\n\"Deposits increase by a factor of 1/reserve requirement.\"\n\nOK, [well at least we know that theory is wrong](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm)...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3 - CREDIT CREATION THEORY**\n\nFinally, we get to Credit Creation Theory.\n\nThis was dominant until around the 1920s, and it is at odds with the other two theories by representing banks not as financial intermediaries - neither in aggregate nor individually.\n\n***Instead, each bank is said to create credit and therefore create money out of nothing whenever it loans money or purchases assets.***\n\nThis means that banks do *not* need to first gather deposits or reserves to lend money.\n\nAccording to the Scottish Economist Henry Dunning Macleod:\n\n\"Bankers, no doubt, do collect sums from a vast number of persons, but the peculiar essence of their business is, not to lend that money to other persons, but on the basis of this bullion to create a vast superstructure of Credit; to multiply their promises to pay many times: these Credits being payable on demand and performing all the functions of an equal amount of cash. \n\n...the business of banking is not to lend money, but to create Credit\"\n\nSo the Credit Creation theory differs from the Fractional Reserve Theory, as one bank *is able* to create deposits.\n\nNow you would expect many empirical tests of these theories, to see which one is correct? Right?\n\nWell, no.\n\nFrom the mid-19th century until 2014, there were no scientific empirical tests on this issue.\n\nThe first empirical test was [published in 2014 by Richard Werner](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070).\n\nOnly the credit creation theory was consistent with the observed accounting records.\n\nSurprisingly, the Credit Creation Theory does *not* feature in most contemporary economics, finance or banking textbooks.\n\nThink about this:\n\nSince roughly the 1920s, there has been a movement from the accurate credit creation theory to the misleading, inconsistent and incorrect fractional reserve theory to today's dominant, yet completely implausible and blatantly wrong financial intermediation theory.\n\nAnd this is why Economics is NOT a science. \n\nFields such as physics and mathematics have high standards for rational truth for obvious reasons, a mathematical proof is a mathematical proof, a theory that matches with experiment repeatedly is a theory that matches with experiment repeatedly (i.e. these fields strip away human emotion and present cold, rational truth).\n\nThe Field of Economics on the other hand has been corrupted, providing the *propaganda* for the Banking Cartel.\n\nThe interesting thing...is that the Banking Cartel, and when I say banks I am referring commercial banks here, [are under attack from another Cartel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4sOWJDDZsI).\n\nA Cartel set to become more powerful than ever before...\n\nThe Central Banking Cartel.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXpZKpmkuas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXpZKpmkuas)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CREDIT**\n\nWerner, R.A., A lost century in economics: Three theories of banking and the conclusive evidence, International Review of Financial Analysis (2015)", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "created_utc": 1603004348.0, "tickers": []}

Let’s say this increase passed and is now the normal across the board. All employees who receive minimum wage are now making $15.00/hour. In a perfect world, not a single employee will lose their job, but this simply isn’t the case and is unrealistic. Let’s pretend no one lost their job, and life continues as normal for this bracket. \n\nAs all minimum wage employees are now making double their previous salaries the question remains for all of the employees who didn’t make minimum wage but were within the wage gap such as the $10.00/hour, the $12.00 hour, the $15.00/hour, etc. Would all of these wages be boosted to a new monetary value to suffice for the new gap that was created? \n\nEmployers who would normally pay their employees $14.00/hour for certain trade skills, manufacturing jobs, or collegiate roles are now all of a sudden struggling to compete with the fast food industry or mall retail to maintain a workforce as these roles require less work for more pay. An employee before the minimum wage increase making $14.00/hour would in theory require their salary to be increased to $22.00/hour to suffice for inflation and the recent $8.00 increase to minimum wage. This would then create a trickle up effect for every other job on the market as employees demand wages to fit their work. \n\nAfter all is said and done, we’re right back at square one, but with higher inflation. \n\nThoughts?", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1603664899.0, "tickers": []}

TLDR at bottom!\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWith the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. \n\n**Finding our compatible companies.** \n\nI only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) \n\n1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)\n\n2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). \n\n3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). \n\n4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). \n\n5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)\n\n**Understanding the HVAC market.**\n\nBefore we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.\n\nSome facts: \n\n1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. \n\n2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. \n\n3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).\n\n4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.\n\n5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).\n\n6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.\n\nAs can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.\n\n\\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.\n\n\\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.\n\n\\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.\n\n\\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.\n\n\\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.\n\n\\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.\n\n**Market share.**\n\nThis was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:\n\n\\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.\n\n\\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.\n\n\\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.\n\n\\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.\n\n\\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%\n\nMy conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.\n\n**An introduction to the Companies**\n\n**Carrier**\n\nCarrier products and related services include HVAC and refrigeration systems, building controls and automation, fire and special hazard suppression systems and equipment, security monitoring and rapid response systems, provided to a diversified international customer base principally in the industrial, commercial and residential property and commercial transportation sectors.\n\nEmployees: 53,000+\n\nCountries active: 160+\n\nMarket Cap: 25,959B\n\n**Key points:**\n\n\\- 85% of sales are in the USA or Europe, they are however planning to expand globally.\n\n\\- 51% HVAC, 29% Fire and Security, 20% Refrigeration.\n\n\\- Since April 2020 carrier has split off from Raytheon Technologies, allowing them to focus fully on the HVACR market.\n\n\\- Carrier is planning on cutting 600million in costs by 2022 (4% of current COGS)\n\n\\- Carrier has recently launched its “BlueEdge” platform, providing aftermarket service to customers and minimizing machinery downtime & costs.

Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.\n\nLooking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:\n\n\\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.\n\n\\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.\n\n\\- Daikin spends the most on R&D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.\n\n\\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.\n\n\\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.\n\n\\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise\n\n\\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.\n\n\\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. \n\n\\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio\n\n\\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.\n\n\\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M\n\nNow on to the less financial aspect of the data.\n\nI really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.\n\nTo conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "created_utc": 1603657670.0, "tickers": [["AC", 8], ["TTM", 1]]}

That was essentially a feudal relationship - not for a capitalist profit but a direct share. Therefore there was no place for a capitalist crisis there. Furthermore two assisting factors. Firstly, the farmers were less dependent on market consumption than the urban workers, they could consume more out of their direct production. Secondly, the unemployment in the cities forced them to stay in the rural economy. \n\nThe cause of major capitalist crises the fall of the rate of profit resulted in the decrease of the industrial output that multiplied to the entire non rural economy causing a drop by one third. \n\nThe crucial point is that this increased the non rural value relatively to agriculture. As explained in the beginning as opposed to the industrial capitalists the farmers had to keep paying the rent. Precisely those factors forced a deflation of agricultural output by 33% in real terms. Here we find the deterioration of agricultural terms of trade.\n\nA general deflation could not solve the problem because it would merely restore the lack of demand at a lower level of prices.

the difference being that Japan is effectively a US puppet due to military leverage, which is not the case with China. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ministry of Finance were the top dogs in Japan's post-war economy.\n\nThey controlled most aspects of the economy.\n\nThe Bank of Japan, Japan's Central Bank, had to report to the Ministry of Finance.\n\n***However, the quantity of credit creation and its allocation was decided by the Bank of Japan.***\n\nVia a process known as window guidance, the Bank of Japan was able to dictate to whom and for what banks could issue loans.\n\nEssentially, the Bank of Japan told the Commercial Banks how much they will have to lend in the coming quarter and which sectors they would have to lend to.\n\nWhenever the Ministry of Finance would inquire about the Bank of Japan's Window Guidance policy, Bank of Japan staff would engage in complex discussions, full of technical jargon - to make the process seem impenetrable to non experts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, Central Banks such as the Bank of Japan like to have full independence and establish absolute power. \n\nSo how did they do it?\n\nWell, they needed to create a bubble, which would then lead to a crisis, which would then lead to the power grab.\n\nThe Bank of Japan began to significantly increase window guidance loan quotas, average yearly loan growth quotas were close to 15% in the late 1980s.\n\n***Essentially, they forced the commercial banks to engage in ridiculous levels of credit creation.***\n\nThis caused a boom in the stock market, and in real estate.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1989, stocks rose around 240% and land prices rose 245%.\n\nAlthough Japan is 26 times smaller than the United States, its land was valued at 4 times that of the United States.\n\nTherefore, instead of being used to limit and direct credit appropriately, Window Guidance was used to create a giant bubble.\n\nThe Bank of Japan was well aware that the only way for banks to meet their loan quotas, was to expand non-productive lending and therefore these asset bubbles in stocks and real estate formed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, so we have a bubble. \n\nTime to pop it.\n\nYasushi Mieno, in his first press conference as the 26th Governor of the Bank of Japan in 1989, said that\n\n***\"Since the previous policy of monetary easing had caused the land price rise problems, real estate related lending would now be restricted.\"***\n\nWell, the press lauded him - fighting against this silly monetary policy.\n\nIn fact, *he* was Deputy Governor during the bubble era, and *he* was in charge of creating the bubble!\n\nStarting just a week after his appointment, from late December 1989 until August 1990, the Bank of Japan *heavily* increased interest rates. \n\nSoon...the Japanese asset price bubble of the 1980s...popped.\n\nBankruptcies galore.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2003, the stock market fell by around 80% and land prices in the major cities fell by up to 84%.\n\nOf course, mainstream economists were relieved - the downturn demonstrates that Japan's economic system was not so successful after all.\n\nThou shalt embrace neoliberalism.\n\nAccording to Mieno:\n\n***\"Thanks to this recession, everyone is becoming aware of the need to implement economic transformation.\"***\n\nBy the way, and this is important and very often overlooked, after his five-year term ended in 1994, Mieno became a Director at the BIS, the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank for central banks...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order to end the recession and improve performance, it was claimed that Japan must shift from welfare capitalism back to shareholder capitalism.\n\nOf course Japan, a country that had run a consistent and significant trade surplus, needed to change its economic system to become more competitive...\n\nIt certainly has worked a treat - check out Japan's debt to GDP ratio since the asset bubble popped around 1990.\n\nOh, there's more...\n\n***Soon after his post ended in 1994, Mieno embarked on a campaign, giving speeches blaming the Ministry of Finance for the creation of the bubble and the long recession.***\n\nHe lobbied for a change in the Bank of Japan law.\n\nHe suggested that it was the Ministry of Finance who had pushed the Bank of Japan into the wrong policies and, of course, to avoid such problems in the future, the Bank of Japan needed to be given full legal independence.\n\n***In 1998, monetary policy was put entirely into the hands of the newly independent Bank of Japan.***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCGs2m4GCp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCGs2m4GCp4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCREDIT: Princes of the Yen by Richard Werner", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "created_utc": 1604486362.0, "tickers": []}

{"name": "t3_jpo3cj", "title": "The Petrodollar Era - What is the Endgame?", "text": "After World War II, a new international monetary system called Bretton Woods was created.\n\nBretton Woods established three main things:\n\n(1) the U.S. dollar was to be an international reserve currency, \n\n(2) the U.S. dollar would be backed by gold at a price of $35 per ounce, and \n\n(3) any country could exchange dollars for gold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCountries running trade surpluses with the US sought to exchange their dollars for gold, and this rapidly shrunk US gold reserves. \n\nThis then led to the so called Nixon shock - President Richard Nixon effectively ending the Bretton Woods system in 1971.\n\nThe world economy entered a new era: the US Dollar became the global reserve currency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe US made no effort to rein in deficit spending, in fact quite the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the US needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt (i.e. to find buyers of US Treasury Securities) *without* driving up interest rates.\n\nThat is, the US needed more buyers for its debt.\n\nBut by 1974, the enormous flood of dollars from the US into top-oil-exporter Saudi Arabia suggested a solution.\n\nThat year, Nixon sent new US Treasury secretary William Simon to Saudi Arabia with a mission...\n\nThe task: neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon against the US and find a way to persuade a relatively hostile kingdom to finance America's widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe basic framework was simple: the US would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment.\n\nIn return, the Saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into US Treasuries and therefore finance America's spending.\n\nA win-win: the Saudis would receive protection from geopolitical enemies, and the US would get a new place to unload large amounts of government debt.\n\nThis became known as \"petrodollar recycling\".\n\nBy *spending* on oil, the US was creating new demand for US debt and US dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoreover, since Saudi Arabia dominated the OPEC - the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - this dollar deal was extended to OPEC overall, which meant that the dollar became the preferred currency for oil purchases worldwide.\n\nAnd so the petrodollar era began.\n\nThis petrodollar system has had *massive* implications for US foreign policy, which has essentially involved imposing 'freedom' on any major oil-exporting state that moves towards ending its reliance on dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2000, Saddam Hussein, then-president of Iraq, announced that Iraq was moving to sell its oil in Euros instead of dollars.\n\nFollowing a particular catalyst event in 2001, the US invaded Iraq, deposed Saddam Hussein, and converted Iraqi oil sales back to the US dollar.\n\nOf course, this exact pattern was repeated with Gaddafi when he attempted to create a unified African currency backed by Libyan gold reserves to sell African oil.\n\nShortly after his announcement, rebels armed by the US Government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime.\n\nAfter his death, the idea that African oil would be sold on something other than the dollar quickly died out.\n\nOther regimes that have called for abandoning the petrodollar include Iran and Venezuela. \n\nThe US has called for regime change in both of these countries...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough they have tried to keep it under wraps, Saudi Arabia is believed to be one of America's largest foreign creditors.\n\nUndoubtedly, Saudi holdings of US debt and other assets are significant.\n\nAll else being equal, the US should be growing less dependent on foreign holders of debt, certainly in terms of Saudi and OPEC-held debt, since the global role of OPEC and the Saudis has been diminishing in terms of global market share.\n\nBut all else *isn't* equal, and the US has been piling on ever-larger amounts of debt in recent years. \n\nIn 2019, for example, the annual deficit topped *one trillion*. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis immense growth in debt obviously makes the US regime more sensitive to changes in demand for US debt, and ever more reliant on foreign demand for both US debt and US dollars. \n\nIn order to avoid a crisis, the US must ensure that interest rates remain low and that foreigners want to acquire both US dollars and US debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWere petrodollars and petrodollar recycling to disappear, it would have a twofold effect on US government finances: \n\nFirst of all, a sizable decline in petrodollar recycling would put significant *upward* pressure on interest rates. \n\nThe result would be a budget crisis for the US government, as it would have to devote ever-larger amounts of the federal budget to payments on the debt. \n\n(The other option would be to have the US central bank monetize the debt by purchasing ever-larger amounts of it to make up for a lack of foreign demand. But this would lead to growing price inflation.)\n\nFurthermore, if participants began to exit the petrodollar system (and, say, sell oil in euros instead) demand for dollars would drop, exacerbating any scenarios in which the central bank is monetizing the debt.  \n\nThis would also generally contribute to greater price inflation, as fewer dollars will be sucked out of the US by foreign holders.\n\nThe result could be ongoing declines in government spending on services, and growing price inflation. \n\nThe US regime's ability to finance its debt would decline significantly, and the US would need to pull back on military commitments, pensions, and more. \n\nEither that, or keep spending at the same rate and face an inflationary spiral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr...how about another option?\n\nAnyone fancy a Great Reset? \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCREDIT: \n\nRyan McMaken\n\n[Huge Debt Got Us Hooked on Petrodollars — and on Saudi Arabia](https://mises.org/wire/huge-debt-got-us-hooked-petrodollars-%E2%80%94-and-saudi-arabia)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1604742083.0, "tickers": []}

Well, we’ve shut down a lot of people in this particular induced recession and others are prospering, and I think the country owes it to the really million of business people.\nThe window to apply for PPP loans expired earlier this year even with funds remaining in the program. However, Congress has been in a stalemate for months in its negotiations for new government aid, putting pressure on businesses, particularly the smaller ones.\n\nLate on Monday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers presented a $908 billion fiscal stimulus package. The proposal includes about $300 billion to support small businesses, including restaurants and entertainment venues.\n\nSmall businesses, especially restaurants, have struggled to stay afloat during the pandemic as social distancing restrictions force them to limit capacity. Some businesses have been forced to shut down temporarily — and permanently, in some cases — because of these limitations and a lack of stimulus.\n\n\nWithout additional aid for small businesses, Congress is “in the process of dashing the dreams of tens of thousands,” Buffett said. “Congress should act.”\n\n“It would be so foolish to not follow through on this and enable those people to get back to where they could do the kind of business they were doing before,” Buffett added.", "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "created_utc": 1608082334.0, "tickers": []}

I’m going to stick with the example of farmers as it seems like the easiest one to explain: Often times people in those industries are hit with surprise prices and it really takes a toll on them financially when they require the use of water to grow crops. The reason other natural resources are commoditized at the moment is mainly to help people hedge their costs, making sure their financial and business planning for day-to-day operations remain stable. The reason water is being commoditized NOW is because of some things that happened in the Australian water market (read up on it if you’re interested) \n\nOf course, the intentions behind the commoditization of water are positive, but as we all know... speculators are the real cause for concern.

{"name": "t3_kfxdlw", "title": "The Crisis Housing Act would automatically activate housing vouchers for the poorest to spend on housing after hurricanes and wildfires—or if a state’s unemployment rate increases drastically.", "text": "The Crisis Housing Act Program (CHAP), a new bill introduced this week by Senators Brian Schatz, of Hawaii, and Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, aims to put an end to the cycle of ineligibility and inaction by allowing the dispersal of emergency funds to be automatically triggered after major disasters. That would eliminate congressional stalling every time there’s a catastrophe, and also ensure the poorest qualify for financial assistance.\nthe main aim of this bill is to focus on disaster relief, it also has a second trigger—for unemployment. Specifically, resources would be triggered by a 0.5% increase in the six-month average of a state’s unemployment rate, relative to its low during the previous year (a metric known as the Sahm Rule, named for economist Claudia Sahm). That arm of the bill was influenced by the COVID-19 economic crisis, as unemployment has greatly exacerbated people’s inability to pay rent, and there’s currently a bipartisan bill under discussion that would extend the eviction moratorium for another month and set aside $25 million for rent relief.\n\nBut rent payment has been a problem for a long time: Even before the pandemic, 15% of U.S. households spent more than 50% of their income on rent. “We really want Congress to shift its focus to be thinking about systemic, long-term solutions that really get at the heart of these issues,” Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy for the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), says. Those measures would build a stronger safety net for future disasters and emergencies. In the long run, the bill would also be more resourceful, Saadian says, in preventing homelessness’s costly problems, like shelter, healthcare, and foster care. “It’s pretty inexpensive, in the scheme of things.”\n\n\n\n“When disaster strikes, families shouldn’t be left without a home or stuck in limbo waiting for Congress to pass a disaster relief bill,” Senator Schatz said in a press release. “Too many people in our country are housing insecure, and this is a good first step to building a safety net to support them.”\n\nWhen disasters hit, poorer people have to wait for weeks or months for Congress to enact federal funding so they can access aid. After 2018’s Hurricane Michael, the first Category 5 hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. in 26 years, Congress took eight months to approve funding. While CHAP would have to initially pass in Congress, it would then permanently allow the automatic authorization of resources in the event of a major disaster, without the need for congressional approval—making funds ready and available for the most in need.", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1608337585.0, "tickers": []}

By one estimate, it may collectively cost tipped workers more than $700 million a year.\n\nThe new Tip Regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act rolls back the so-called 80/20 rule, which previously required that 80% of the time a worker who makes the tipped minimum wage (which is lower than the regular tipped minimum wage) spends should be dedicated to tipped work, principally interacting with customers. In a published press statement, the Labor Department’s wage and hour administrator, Cheryl Stanton, said the rule was instated partly because it “provides clarity and flexibility for employers.”\n\nBut cutting this protection for workers has the potential to severely limit a tipped workers’ wage, according to Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), who previously served as Obama’s chief economist in his Labor Department. In an EPI release, she said that this “immense loophole” for employers could cost $700 million in servers’ wages annually—and that’s a pre-COVID-19 figure, which stands to be higher now.\n\nDue to in-house dining cutbacks during the pandemic, many tipped workers are serving less and doing other tasks such as assembling takeout orders. Natasha , a restaurant server in midtown Manhattan we spoke to (we have chosen to omit her last name and the restaurant’s name to ensure job safety) says she’s cooking, cleaning, and even doing electrical work. “I’d say the fact that I work primarily for tips is almost insulting,” she says. “I would say that my job right now is almost entirely non-tipped work.”\n\nThe new rule is vague about the amount of time servers would have to perform non-tipped duties, only calling for “reasonable” time.\n\nThe directive also allows employers to implement “tip sharing,” whereby gratuity earned by tipped workers, usually servers, can be distributed among non-tipped workers, such as dishwashers and cooks, who are often “excluded from participating in tip pools in the past,” Stanton said in the department’s release. This pooling of tips is already legal in many states and will be permitted only if servers make the standard minimum wage for food workers, which varies to a great degree by state and city. Still, it’s a way for employers to skirt raising wages for kitchen staff.\n\nWhen asked about the reasons for implementing the rule and the criticisms, a Department of Labor spokesperson simply sent a list of FAQs on tips.\n\n“The Trump administration opting, in its last 29 days and during a pandemic, to take more than $700 million out of the pockets of service workers is an emblematic parting blow from this administration to the working people of this country,” EPI’s Shierholz stated in the release. It’s also not the fullest extent of what the Trump administration aimed to do; as early as 2018, it wanted to allow tips to also be shared with managers and supervisors. It walked that back after a compromise was reached between Senator Patty Murray and then-Labor Secretary Alex Acosta.\n\nBut the directive won’t take effect for another two or so months—at which point the Biden administration could potentially delay it or replace it with its own preferred guidance.\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/90589995/a-last-minute-trump-administration-rule-could-lower-restaurant-workers-wages-by-700-million-a-year", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1608766763.0, "tickers": []}
{"name": "t3_kir1hm", "title": "After destroying its economy, Erdogan is indebting Turkey", "text": "  \n\nIn the last two and a half years, Turkey's economic situation has deteriorated sharply, and just when it was struggling to get back on track, after the recession following the currency crisis of the summer of 2018, the pandemic emergency, and the foreign military campaigns stopped its recovery. In the second quarter of 2020, in the months of the main production activities and international connections closure, the Turkish GDP contracted by 11% compared to the previous quarter, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a contraction in growth of 5% at the end of 2020.\n\nTo avoid the political and financial collapse, Erdogan took out a loan from the World Bank. That shows the inability of Erdogan and Turkey to secure even a very small amount. According to the World Bank, $300 million Rapid Support for Micro and Small Enterprises Project for Turkey, implemented by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization of Turkey (KOSGEB), will help people and firms by providing reimbursable support financing for manufacturing firms and other, innovative young firms focusing on manufacturing, scientific research and development, and computer programming. If Ankara presents Turkey as an industrial and rich country that lends Somalia and other nations, in reality, it appears to be unable to secure this amount.\n\nIt is clear that the policy adopted by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in recent years, namely that of stimulating growth through broad access to credit favored by low rates, has not only not worked but has been counterproductive. The unsuccessful attempt to support the lira over the past two years has cost Turkey 140 billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Also, for this reason, the management of former Finance Minister Beret Albayrak, who resigned after Erdogan replaced the governor of the Central Bank, become the target of criticism, not only from the opposition but also from within the ruling party. Among the most critical within the AKP, it seems that there was precisely Ağbal, his predecessor in the economy.\n\nErdogan is aware that the deterioration of the economy could cost dearly the political stability of his party. However, today the AKP, also due to the negative economic performance, is suffering from a decline in consensus and is suffering from internal divisions and several spills, such as that of former Finance Minister Ali Babacan, who last March founded the Democracy and Progress Party (Deva), and Ahmet Davutoglu, a former prime minister.\n\n“The WB financing provided under the project will go to Micro and Small Enterprises in Turkey, which are the main source of employment for poor and near-poor households and account for more than 40 percent of employment in the manufacturing sector,” remarked Stefka Slavova, Lead Economist at the World Bank and co-Task Team leader of the project. But it will be impossible for Turkey to repay this debt in the short to medium term.\n\nIf international investors have seen the appointment of the new Governor of the Turkish Central Bank as a signal of a change of direction and a return to a more conventional monetary policy, and more independent of President Erdogan's bankruptcy line, it is probably just a measure that doesn’t go beyond the short-term objective of stabilizing exchange rates. As long as Erdogan remains at the helm of Turkey, his interests and the Muslim Brotherhood's expansionist ambitions in the region will continue to weigh on the state economy, effectively making it impossible to return even 50% of the amount provided by the World Bank.\n\nOne month after his appointment, the new governor of the Turkish central bank Naci Agbal has implemented a significant increase in the interest rate from 10.25% to 15%. A move that reverses the low-interest rate policy pursued by the monetary institution over the past year and a half to stimulate growth - as requested by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - but which nevertheless did nothing but accelerate the devaluation of the Turkish lira and increase inflation, which has reached almost 12%. In the immediate future, the central bank's decision resulted in an appreciation of 3% of the national currency, which from January to early November lost 30% of its value against the dollar.\n\n[http://surl.li/ijuz](http://surl.li/ijuz)", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1608720934.0, "tickers": [["WB", 1]]}

An article today claimed real estate is a good investment during times of inflation. My opinion is that's it's a bit more nuanced. In short, there is a difference between inflation and inflation expectations. When the two are the same, it does not make much difference. Inflation expectations is reflected in the price you pay for real estate. Actual inflation is reflected in the value growth of your real estate. \n\nIn the early 1980s, inflation expectations were double digits, reflecting recent inflation rates of 10-15%. Over the following ten years actual inflation continually declined, and a lot of people who bought property in 1980 or 1981 got killed. They paid prices based on expectations, but their real estate growth reflected actual inflation.\n\nOver the last thirty years, inflation and inflation expectations were very close. Not only did the difference not matter to people, but people also grew accustomed to ignoring the difference and became complacent to it.\n\nI once heard a large real estate investor say many analysts like to type in 3% for rent growth across their pro formas. When he asks them why they used 3%, they say, \"I don't know. Do you think I should use something else?\"\n\nOver the next few years, I see inflation and inflation expectations running starkly different from each other.\n\nI think a good approach to valuing real estate is to use actual future inflation, not current inflation expectations, and consider that the asking price make reflect expectations but not future reality. Of course, inflation is only one variable that contributes to value growth of real estate, but miss judging it can be distasterous. You must also consider other market variables too, such as population growth, jobs growth, types of jobs, and specific types of real estate people desire. Just be sure to accurately estimate future inflation and put it into value your ROI calculations, but don't expect the price to reflect it.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1608814686.0, "tickers": []}
