People are going to be utterly essential as consumers‹what I call regenerative consumers, however, not just swill pails.\"", "text": "> Automation is with us. There is no question about it. Automation was inevitable to intellect. Intellect was found to diferentiate out experience continually and to articulate and develop new tools to do physically repeated tasks. Man is now no longer essential as a worker in the fabulously complex industrial equation. Marx’s worker is soon to become utterly obsolete. Automation is coming in Russia just as it is here. The word worker describing man as a muscle-and-reflex machine will not have its current 1961 meaning a decade hence. Therefore, if man is no longer essential as a worker we ask: \"How can he live? How does he acquire the money or credits with which to purchase what he needs or what he wants that is available beyond immediate needs?\" At the present time we are making all kinds of economic pretenses at covering up this overwhelming automation problem because we don’t realize adequately the larger significance of the truly fundamental change that is taking place in respect to man-in-universe. As automation advanced man began to create secondary or nonproductive jobs to make himself look busy so that he could rationalize a necessity for himself by virtue of which he could \"earn\" his living. Take all of our bankers, for example. They are all fixtures; these men don’t have anything to do that a counting machine couldn’t do; a punch button box would suffice. They have no basic banking authority whatsoever today. They do not loan you their own wealth. They loan you your own wealth. But man has a sense of vanity and has to invent these things that make him look important.\n\n> ....\n\n> The vast industrial complex undertakings and associated capital investments are today so enormous and take so long to inaugurate that they require concomitantly rapid regenerative economics to support them. The enterprise must pay off very rapidly in order to be able to refund itself and obtain the economic advantage to inaugurate solution of the next task with still higher technical advantage. In that regenerative cycle of events, the more consumers there are the more the costs are divided and the lower the individual prices. The higher the frequency of the consuming the more quickly the capital cost can be refunded, and the sooner the system is ready for the next wave of better technology. So man is essential to the industrial equation as a consumer‹as a regenerative consumer, a critical consumer, a man who tasting wants to taste better and who viewing realizes what he views can be accomplished more efficiently and more interestingly. The consumer thus becomes a highly critical regenerative function, requiring an educational system that fosters the consumer’s regenerative capacity and capability.\n\n> ....\n\n> Every time we educate a man, we as educators have a regenerative experience, and we ought to learn from that experience how to do it much better the next time. The more educated our population the more effective it becomes as an integral of regenerative consumer individuals. We are going to have to invest in our whole population to accelerate its consumer regeneration. We are going to be completely unemployed as muscle-working machines. We as economic society are going to have to pay our whole population to go to school and pay it to stay at school. That is, we are going to have to put our whole population into the educational process and get everybody realistically literate in many directions. Quite clearly, the new political word is going to be investment. It is not going to be dole, or socialism, or the idea of people hanging around in bread lines. The new popular regenerative investment idea is actually that of making people more familiar with the patterns of the universe, that is, with what man has learned about universe to date, and that of getting everybody inter-communicative at ever higher levels of literacy. People are then going to stay in the education process. They are going to populate ever increasing numbers of research laboratories and universities.\n\n> As we now disemploy men as muscle and reflex machines, the one area where employment is gaining abnormally fast is the research and development area. Research and development are a part of the educational process itself. We are going to have to invest in our people and make available to them participation in the great educational process of research and development in order to learn more. When we learn more, we are able to do more with our given opportunities. We can rate federally paid-for education as a high return, mutual benefit investment. When we plant a seed and give it the opportunity to grow its fruits pay us back many fold. Man is going to \"improve\" rapidly in the same way by new federally underwritten educational \"seeding\" by new tools and processes.\n\n> Our educational processes are in fact the upcoming major world industry. This is it; this is the essence of today’s educational facilities meeting. You are caught in that new educational upward draughting process. The cost of education will be funded regeneratively right out of earnings of the technology, the industrial equation, because we can only afford to reinvest continually in humanity’s ability to go back and turn out a better job. As a result of the new educational processes our consuming costs will be progressively lower as we also gain ever higher performance per units of invested resources, which means that our wealth actually will be increasing at all times rather than \"exhausted by spending.\" It is the \"capability\" wealth that really counts. It is very good that there is an international competitive system now operating, otherwise men would tend to stagnate, particularly in large group undertakings. They would otherwise be afraid to venture in this great intellectual integrity regeneration.\n\n> I would say, then? that you are faced with a future in which education is going to be number one amongst the great world industries, within which will flourish an educational machine technology that will provide tools such as the individually selected and articulated two-way TV and an intercontinentally net-worked, documentaries call-up system, operative over any home two-way TV set.\n\n> ....\n\n[Education Automation, Freeing the Scholar to Return to His Studies](http://web.archive.org/web/20020210193837/http://www.bfi.org/ea5.htm) By Buckminster Fuller\n\n    SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY PRESS, CARBONDALE AND\n    EDWARDSVILLE\n    FEFFER & SIMONS, INC., LONDON AND AMSTERDAM\n    Copyright 1962\n    ISBN 0-8093-0137-7\n    Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 62 - 17620", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "created_utc": 1400777676.0, "tickers": [["TV", 2]]}

With Food Stamps (now SNAP), you get a card pre-loaded with money that can only be used to purchase foods from an approved retail store selling food. \n\n**What interests me is this: how do you think SNAP money is spent??** There are anecdotes of people on SNAP spending that money on chips, cookies, and soft drinks, but there is so much food available and no one knows what percentage of money is spent on what. Economic theory would support the argument that we make different decisions based on our situation, but when we get bonuses (or additional tax rebates), most people don't go out and spend those right away. With the Bush tax break, spending was not spurned and was a great example of how people took the unexpected money and put it to use in bettering their financial situation (paying down debts, investing it, etc.), not on buying a new TV.\n\nEBT benefits are different - we all need food, and you can get by on almost anything. Your healthiness will be different if you are eating cookies and chips everyday instead of vegetables and chicken, but you can still live. These benefits also aren't unexpected - they come in monthly.\n\n**Would consumers on these programs be theoretically inclined to spend their benefits in ways that are more immediately gratifying? People will act in more risky ways with money that isn't theirs, so is it fair to say that consumer on these programs will spend money in more personally satisfying ways when using money given to them by the government?** \n\n*I personally believe that people on these programs spend money differently and are not well educated in nutrition, so this spending can lead to adverse health affects that, for those on medicare and SNAP, would mean the public is paying the costs of food and health care, and the person is paying the cost of having poor health.

In the discussion, I am Shad Walker.\n\nIt starts off as a meme of with some gold bricks and the caption \"The dollar was backed by this\"; then cuts to a picture of an aircraft carrier with the caption \"Now its backed by this\".\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\ncWe need to take this understanding to the masses so that we stand up together and say \"no more!\" and \"not in our name!\" The value of the dollar is backed by \"oil dollars\" and everything you consume is tied to other countrys' needs to have \"petrodollar reserves\" just to run their economies. What will the U.S. do when other countries STOP TRADING OIL WITH U.S. CURRENCY? What have they done in the past?\n\n  \n\n\nShad Walker To bad gold is still Fiat. So even when the dollar is back by gold, it is still really only backed by some peoples emotional response of \"want\" to something shiny.\n\nMira Siente anything we put \"faith\" in can be currency. What do you think will replace our currency system in the future? Got any good ideas?\n\nShad Walker Ohh personally I would just like to see us get away from money period. Once you start regulating such systems, that employ money, to the level that would be needed to avoid silly games and loopholes, money itself becomes a moot middle step of resource \n\nMira Siente the problem is the concentration of people in one place so now we have people living on top of people and the means to feed and supply for our needs doesn't come from the land or natural resources- it comes from selling our labor and then exchanging our loot for the things we need to survive. How do we unravel a society dependant on money for survival? I am with you on getting rid of money and going back to a simpler, productive life/society.\n\n\nShad Walker We produce enough food for about 12 billion people, and only have about 7 billion on the planet. That is an extra 5 billion people worth of food. Really, it just comes down to us doing it.\n\nShad Walker I would like to see a Democratic Resource Based Economy Nation. Granted, it would work best worldwide, but there are some countries that have the natural resources to pull it off on a National Level.\n\nMira Siente Who controls the means to produce that much food? The ownership is not shared so profit and control and using labor to make it happen. Money is involved in that equation.\n\nShad Walker If we could get the entire planet in about 3 \"sections\", the Democratic RBE nation, then another section of good arable land for anybody who didn't want to be part of that society. They could go live off the grid, peacefully. Build their own homes, etc.\n\nShad Walker No money is involved, much of the labor would be automated, we have the tech and know how to pull it off. Vertical farms and such. You can get an idea of the kind of designs I am talking about from the Venus Project.\n\nMira Siente and what about the other people not wanting either of those?\n\nMira Siente I'm familiar with the concept and the project.\n\nShad Walker Life doesn't provide us with our little heart's every desire. One will have to cry to whatever higher power they believe in about that. This is about creating a sustainable system that promotes peaceful living as best as we humanly can.\n\nShad Walker But I do also believe in wilderness survival / natural living education in our school systems, so if someone does decide to live out in the off the grid zone, they know how to live naturally.\n\nShad Walker That is the best and closest we can come to the idea of Freedom as humans. You are not being coerced to stay as part of the society by fear of death. You would know you could go off to the other \"zone\" and make it no problem. Even start towns and such out there in which the people decide on other types of systems to employ.\n\nMira Siente Who stands in the way of making your vision work? There are people in every country that wants to make it happen but there are macro and individual forces that don't want your vision. They like the dismal, unfair alternative and they are more powerful than people like us.\n\nShad Walker Hrmmm, that is a good question. I would say at this point, it would be the elite oligarchy, and the masses to an extent. The oligarchy because hey, they don't want to loose their power. And the masses just because they don't know anything else then what they've been trained to know. And they are caught up in all the consumerism and toys.\n\nShad Walker Mainly, it would just be getting the other zone not to go so crazy in resource acquisition that they lead back into the problems we see today; ie pollution and depleting natural resources, especially to the extent where it makes an impact on the other parts of the planet and life.\n\nMira Siente What part of the planet is doing this at the moment? How do the people make new towns? Do they have to move to be a part of the community? Like I said, most like the status quo and don't want to change anything. But I hear you. We need to get off the grid. But even if you do, there will be millions of people wanting to experience a capitalist, consumerist lifestyle (McDonalds are in every part of the world right now). \n\nShad Walker Ohh, I still see restaurants and such in this vision. It is much akin to Star Trek the Next Generation style Earth. There would be forms of entertainment, toys, restaurants and such, just not at a crazy level that depletes the natural resources and such. Getting down to exact minuta is difficult at this point, would need access to information I don't have access too along with bean counters to start counting numbers and see where all the resources stand at. \n\nShad Walker As for parts of the planet, I know Mr. Fresco has been to different countries promoting his idea and a few of them have put banners up. I have also seen small scale RBE communities trying to start up, but nothing large scale that I am aware of.\n\nShad Walker https://www.facebook.com/groups/224148967647327/\n\nBUILD A HYBRID RBE COMMUNITY NOW \n\nShad Walker Getting over the Capitalistic/Consumerist mindset is a hurdle, but it is also what is destroying us. An ugly conundrum.\n\nMira Siente supply and demand. People demand their toys and trinkets but not feeding the world proper nutrition. Food is thrown into the ocean to keep the future speculation commodity price up. The big question is do we create a euphoric society or go after the dominant forces or do we do both? Education is key to make people wake up. They've been trying to wake people up for a long time, We've got to do better and try harder.\n\nShad Walker I guess the simple way to put it would be Military Style without the Military Feel. Realty is, the American Military Structure (along with most militarizes) is a highly Socialist Structure. You participate and you get housing, food, medical care, access to entertainment, etc. Along with a monetary stipend.\n\nShad Walker Highly logistics based, how much do we actually have, how much do we actually need, how do we allocate it, and how do we make sure we are not depleting it.\n\nMira Siente I think a spiritual paradigm shift needs to occur before a RBE can be enacted on a large scale (where people want to make sure they care about future generations and depleted/low natural resources). Like I said, they've got us all living in cities. By 2050, 75% of the world population will be living in cities. Very strong political groups and cliches are and will be running them (city council/business partners/investors). Where will the ordinary people and people living off the grid fit into this reality? \n\nShad Walker Well there seems to be a paradigm shift occurring; more people are becoming aware.\n\nAs to the cities and clicks and such, not too much a concern of mine. The logistics is fairly easy to deal with, that is all hard science and numbers. So can calculate the amount of resources along with how to make sure we are not depleting and polluting them.\n\nIt is the social issues that it becomes grey. Personally I am a fan of a fairly liberal social structure, and if there are more conservative “clicks” within the large liberal structure, that is cool too. Birds of a feather tend to flock together; they just have to remember not to let such trivial issues (ie nudist versus non-nudist) get in the way of the bigger picture. They are still all on the same team, each providing to a society in which we create a comfortable lifestyle with plenty of luxuries.\n\nAs to the “off the grid” people that you asked about, I would need to know, do you mean people who want to live “off the grid” within that society or the “off the grid” in the other zone? \n\nMira Siente Both groups... Back to trying to wrangle control back from the people in power on the local level mainly, but moving further out to the states and on a national level. In the U.S., this concept/project is nowhere near launching and is in the infancy stages of development. Looking at this from an abstract view point is only a percentage of what needs to be done. Years still in the making and more people understanding that the current system isn't working and we need another type of society. Not only that, there will be an anti-movement group forming to silence the RBE movement There are people who think this is communism and they are not going to allow us to move towards a RBE. \n\nShad Walker Ohh it has been getting the hush treatment for years. Heck, Mr. Fresco has been talking about this since the 1970's and was even on Larry King.\n\nShad Walker As to the communism thing, people just have to be \"un-brain washed\" so to speak. This country has been spewing out propaganda about different economic systems since at least the 1950's if not longer. Most don't even realize that economic systems and political systems are 2 different things.\n\nThat is why there are Democratic Socialist Nations; and you can even make Democratic Communist Nations.\n\nThey have been trained to auto respond to those words like a Pavloivan Dog responds to the sound of a bell.\n\nIf they can get through that, then they can start looking at these things clearly. \n\nShad Walker Inanimate systems, each have their strengths and weaknesses. And some are just so flawed, they don't work at all without resets, ie Capitalism. Even ancient man knew it get imbalanced and needed periodic resets; Leviticus 25 and the Time of Jubilee is once such example of ancient people knowing this.\n\nMira Siente Is this a technocratic and bureaucratic society?

A full discussion of Moody's results is included in its just-published report \"Asian Covenant Quality Remains Stronger Than Other Regions' in First Quarter of 2015\".\n\nThe overall average covenant quality score for rated Asian high-yield-bond deals issued in the first quarter of this year was at 2.63; similar to the 2.67 for deals issued in the fourth quarter of 2014, but weaker than the long-run cumulative average of 2.49 for the region.\n\nMoody's measures bond covenant quality on a five-point scale, with 1.0 denoting the strongest investor protections and 5.0, the weakest and assesses bond protections against six risk areas: restricted payments, investments in risky assets, leverage, liens subordination, structural subordination and event risk (change of control).\n\n\"Asian covenant quality is good with a cumulative average of 2.49 at end of Q1 2015, which is significantly stronger than the global average of 3.37,\" says Jake Avayou, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Covenant Officer.\n\n\"We note that in Q1 2015, Indian bonds had the strongest covenant protections. Only Indian and Chinese companies issued bonds during this period,\" adds Avayou.\n\nMoody's points out that the two Indian high-yield bonds issued in Q1 2015 contained fewer quantifiable restricted payments, risky investments, and debt carve-outs when compared with the other bonds issued in the same quarter.\n\nMoody's notes that bond protections against three risk areas -- namely restricted payments, investments in risky assets and change of control -- weakened in the first quarter of 2015 from the protections seen in the last quarter of 2014.\n\nWhen compared to Q4 2014, the restricted payment score weakened to 2.97 (moderate category) from 2.48 (good category), and the investments in risky assets score weakened to 3.45 (weak category) from 2.88 (moderate category).\n\nThe weakness was largely due to four Chinese property companies that pre-dated their income baskets to coincide with their previous bond issuances. This approach increases flexibility to pay dividends, buy back stock and make risky investments with money that could otherwise be used to service the bonds, and is a clear negative for bondholders.\n\nIn addition, two of the four Chinese property deals this quarter further weakened protections against risky investments by allowing free reclassification between their general permitted investment baskets and their restricted payments income baskets.\n\nMoody's notes that the region's protection against event risk related to a change of control weakened to 2.11 in Q1 2015 from 1.71 in Q4 2014. The result was because Country Garden Holdings Company Limited's (Ba2 ratings under review for upgrade) and CAR Inc.'s (Ba1 stable) negative ratings conditions specify that triggering a put on the bonds requires a downgrade by two rating agencies if the notes are rated below investment grade by all three ratings agencies, rather than the usual one.\n\n(Source: http://fxwire.pro/Moodys-Asian-covenant-quality-for-high-yield-bonds-holds-steady-better-than-other-regions-24934)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1429063499.0, "tickers": [["CAR", 1]]}

Their problem is very transparent now though. If they artificially inflate prices, they will lose market share to people who can produce oil at those higher prices. They have very cheap oil, and the only thing they can do is produce more of that cheap oil to hamper foreign production...but at the same time they are trying to keep prices inflated while pumping and selling as much oil as they can. They simply don't have as much power as they used to....because they don't have an option like they used to.*\n\n**No I insist, OPEC controls the market because if they say they are going to cutback production, the price will jump**\n\n*I think you are half right. If they said we're dropping production, yes prices would skyrocket....right along with everyone else's production, and then we would have a supply glut...kind of like right now. The thing is...they can't say they are decreasing production...and they don't want to say they are increasing...but they are.*\n\n**Oil is too big to fail**\n\n*So your best argument is that oil is too big to fail? The government is going to bail out oil companies if they go belly up? I think growth and profits accelerate when the price of energy comes down...I would think consolidation in the oil industry would just lead to organic economic growth...rather than a disaster. It would be a disaster to people who have invested too heavily in oil.*\n\n\n**\"because we depend on it\", \"oil is king\", \"energy density\", oh and corn...just fucking corn** http://redd.it/32tiu1  \n\n*not going to reply, unless you insist*\n\n\n**My own argument - The dollar could be on the decline**\n\n*well semitard that is a good argument, why thank you semitard, but the problem is still there if the dollar inflates price...we have a supply glut. If the value of the dollar decreases, and oil continues to climb, it becomes economical for a lot of wells to come back online, and production will ramp, and at the same time, if prices are up, then demand will most likely go down. I suppose we could lift the export band at that point (or any point), but then what do you think OPEC will do?...not stop drilling and losing customers, that is for sure.*\n\n**Rig count**\n\nhttp://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php\n \n*Jaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*\n\nhttp://247wallst.com/energy-business/2015/04/12/low-crude-oil-prices-leave-thousands-of-u-s-wells-uncompleted/ \n\n*There are roughly 2,500 to 3,500 drilled but uncompleted oil wells in the United States, according to analysts at IHS Inc. (NYSE: IHS). As many as 1,400 of those wells are located in the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas.*\n\n*What do you think rig count is going to do if oil goes up?*\n\n*Oh and plus, there are a lot of wells that still have to be completed by law...*\n\nhttp://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/oil-production-down-second-straight-month/article_8f3183a6-ff1f-5a79-b972-a1bd8e67b7c6.html\n\n*Wells must be completed within one year of being drilled by state law. More than 100 wells will hit that deadline in June.*\n\n**Demand is going to increase**\n\n*This is highly speculative, and loses weight as prices increase...and in my opinion a little ignorant considering the current oversupply. I don't think that demand has had its run and is over. I think that the control over the price of oil has had its run, and is now over. Production and demand are going to dictate prices, not so much politics and geology.*\n\n**Iran deal is going to fall through**\n\n*Probably, maybe not. Doesn't change the fact that they are increasing production and still have outlets to sell their oil.*\n\n**Everyone including Goldman Sachs say oil will fall to new lows, I do the opposite**\n\n*This pisses me off that I have to add this, but apparently a lot of people agree (which in itself is funny). Ok...so all the info available, and the people familiar with the situation are expecting the price of oil to go down...so naturally you are a genius contrarian investor that is about to make a killing. So that means you must have bought WTI when it was in the $40's, and when everyone was scared it would keep going down (like all the info suggest). Now what? Oil is up about 30% from that low...when people were being \"greedy\". You think oil is going to just keep shooting up? How much more? 40%, 50%, 220%? If you are buying up oil now, I would say you're jumping on a retard fueled band wagon, you are not being greedy, you are not being a contrarian investor, you are being a fucktard (if this is your'e only argument). You might be able to make an argument about being greedy when oil goes back down to the $40 range, but I think I'm going to wait for more like the low $30. Also, I think the fact this same post got down voted to 0 in /r/stocks proves my point as well.*\n\n**Big picture.. we are barely oversupplied. When you talk millions yeah reserves can build up**\n\n*I agree, but oversupplied none the less...and reserves are still building. If the price of oil goes up, even more will go into storage, I think we agree here.*\n\n**Not to mention there are still emerging markets where oil will become a necessity on top of the fact that the population of the world is not diminishing. It's expanding exponentially**\n\n*Silly thing about humanity is that we evolve, technology evolves, infrastructure for emerging markets evolve. I completely agree that demand will increase. Emerging markets will grow...even faster with cheap energy. Renewable energy will still keep growing faster. Can you imagine how much different the world will be once we can harness fusion power? Anyhow, daily dependence on oil will decrease over time. And, we add about 1 billion people every 15 years...since about 1960, not exactly exponential (thanks for making me look that up.)*\n\n**Finally shale wells peter out fast**\n\n*yeah, I think it's like 90% of production is the first 2 years. We have somewhere between 2500 and 3500 wells just waiting to start producing though...*\n\n**Another conflict will spill over some borders in the Middle East**\n\n*This is probably the best argument I have got yet, and one that I'm fairly ill equipped to argue. I can say that it is highly speculative, but not really far fetched. I do feel like bringing an end to the control over oil could help the middle east get together for the better good of their nations to export as much oil as they can, but I feel like I should slap myself for saying that.* \n\n**a discovery completely undermining the estimated reserves left**\n\n*again, very speculative for near term, but not far fetched...and something we should be expecting in the future, but how far into the future...who knows. I do know we are growing less dependent on oil, and are moving towards renewables, plus technology evolves.  Since we are being speculative, I pose this question...What happens to the world once humanity figures out how to harness fusion power?...there will be a lot of people who will give a lot less fucks about oil when that happens (and we are very close).*", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1429308797.0, "tickers": [["WTI", 1]]}

If they said we're dropping production, yes prices would skyrocket....right along with everyone else's production, and then we would have a supply glut...kind of like right now. The thing is...they can't say they are decreasing production...and they don't want to say they are increasing...but they are.*\n\n**Oil is too big to fail** /r/letthebasskick\n\n*So your best argument is that oil is too big to fail? The government is going to bail out oil companies if they go belly up? I think growth and profits accelerate when the price of energy comes down...I would think consolidation in the oil industry would just lead to organic economic growth...rather than a disaster. It would be a disaster to people who have invested too heavily in oil.*\n\n**\"because we depend on it\", \"oil is king\", \"energy density\" /r/hokaythxbai, oh and corn...just fucking corn** http://redd.it/32tiu1  \n\n*not going to reply, unless you insist*\n\n**My own argument - The dollar could be on the decline**\n\n*The problem is still there if the dollar inflates price...we have a supply glut. If the value of the dollar decreases, and oil continues to climb, it becomes economical for a lot of wells to come back online, and production will ramp, and at the same time, if prices are up, then demand will most likely go down. I suppose we could lift the export band at that point (or any point), but then what do you think OPEC will do?...not stop drilling and losing customers, that is for sure.*\n\n**Rig count** /r/hexmasta\n\nhttp://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php\n \n*Jaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*\n\nhttp://247wallst.com/energy-business/2015/04/12/low-crude-oil-prices-leave-thousands-of-u-s-wells-uncompleted/ \n\n*There are roughly 2,500 to 3,500 drilled but uncompleted oil wells in the United States, according to analysts at IHS Inc. (NYSE: IHS). As many as 1,400 of those wells are located in the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas.*\n\n*What do you think rig count is going to do if oil goes up?*\n\n*Oh and plus, there are a lot of wells that still have to be completed by law...*\n\nhttp://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/oil-production-down-second-straight-month/article_8f3183a6-ff1f-5a79-b972-a1bd8e67b7c6.html\n\n*Wells must be completed within one year of being drilled by state law. More than 100 wells will hit that deadline in June.*\n\n**Demand is going to increase** /r/staticchange\n\n*This is highly speculative, and loses weight as prices increase...and in my opinion a little ignorant considering the current oversupply. I don't think that demand has had its run and is over. I think that the control over the price of oil has had its run, and is now over. Production and demand are going to dictate prices, not so much politics and geology.*\n\n**Iran deal is going to fall through** /r/norcon\n\n*Probably, maybe not. Doesn't change the fact that they are increasing production and still have outlets to sell their oil.*\n\n**Everyone including Goldman Sachs say oil will fall to new lows, I do the opposite** /r/vixgdx, /r/sharked...others\n\n*This pisses me off that I have to add this, but apparently a lot of people agree (which in itself is funny). Ok...so all the info available, and the people familiar with the situation are expecting the price of oil to go down...so naturally you are a genius contrarian investor that is about to make a killing. So that means you must have bought WTI when it was in the $40's, and when everyone was scared it would keep going down (like all the info suggest). Now what? Oil is up about 30% from that low...when people were being \"greedy\". You think oil is going to just keep shooting up? How much more? 40%, 50%, 220%? If you are buying up oil now, I would say you're jumping on a retard fueled band wagon, you are not being greedy, you are not being a contrarian investor, you are being a fucktard (if this is your'e only argument). You might be able to make an argument about being greedy when oil goes back down to the $40 range, but I think I'm going to wait for more like the low $30. Also, I think the fact this same post got down voted to 0 in /r/stocks proves my point as well.*\n\n**Not to mention there are still emerging markets where oil will become a necessity on top of the fact that the population of the world is not diminishing. It's expanding exponentially**/r/cod3r__\n\n*Silly thing about humanity is that we evolve, technology evolves, infrastructure for emerging markets evolve. I completely agree that demand will increase. Emerging markets will grow...even faster with cheap energy. Renewable energy will still keep growing faster. Can you imagine how much different the world will be once we can harness fusion power? Anyhow, daily dependence on oil will decrease over time. And, we add about 1 billion people every 15 years...since about 1960, not exactly exponential (thanks for making me look that up.)*\n\n**Another conflict will spill over some borders in the Middle East** /r/arKK\n\n*This is probably the best argument I have got yet, and one that I'm fairly ill equipped to argue. I can say that it is highly speculative, but not really far fetched. I do feel like bringing an end to the control over oil could help the middle east get together for the better good of their nations to export as much oil as they can, but I feel like I should slap myself for saying that.* \n\n**a discovery completely undermining the estimated reserves left** /r/arKK\n\n*again, very speculative for near term, but not far fetched...and something we should be expecting in the future, but how far into the future...who knows. I do know we are growing less dependent on oil, and are moving towards renewables, plus technology evolves.  Since we are being speculative, I pose this question...What happens to the world once humanity figures out how to harness fusion power?...there will be a lot of people who will give a lot less fucks about oil when that happens (and we are very close).*\n\n**Wait, back to OPEC...As far as OPEC goes, they have to do something. At the current price point, OPEC by majority is not happy.**/r/KU76\n\n*Very true. In order for a large portion of OPEC to remain fiscal balance, oil needs to be higher....how much higher?....ridiculously higher. According to Thomsan Reuters it starts at ~$58 for Qatar, and ends at ~$136 for Iran.* \n\nhttp://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/opec/index.html\n\n*Why? Because it's not a private business over there. Fiscal breakeven pays for a majority of their \"government\" expenditures....including subsidies and royal privileges. The cost that it actually takes them to produce a barrel of oil is actually the cheapest on earth. They have been so used to relying on oil production, and having the ability to manipulate the market, that they have grown very used to making a very wide margin. The profits from oil in Saudi Arabia account for ~80% of what the \"government\" spends....which is why on the above Thompsan Reuters chart, it says their breakeven is ~$93.*\n\nhttps://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/oil-revenue-as-a-share-of-government-revenue-opec-member-non-opec-member_chartbuilder.jpg?w=640\n\n*So, it's funny that they are increasing production. Why?...to drive out U.S. shale. But wait, how long are they going to be able to do that for? Not very, even though they have massive reserves, they also have massive expenditures...a few years probably at best. This is where I get speculative, and what this half tard thinks is going on. The thing is, is that this is a bit of an economic war that is going on. Guess who is good at war...and economics? There is a bit of chess going on right now. Shale put OPEC in check. OPEC's only option is to adjust. There is a lot of corruption, a lot of waist, a lot of arrogance...that just got put into check. So it's their move. From the looks of things, I would say they are hell bent on applying the pressure back on Shale...which will work (hasn't quite yet)...but, (I believe at least) it will drive out some competition for a bit...no, not forever. They are going to have to diversify their economies....which is a good thing. Saudi Arabia has openly admitted to this, as well as Putin...and they have been working on it. So, what am I saying? What I have been saying, supply and demand are going to dictate the price of oil....not so much politics and geology. Right now we are oversupplied, and that is going to get worse...for now.*\n\n**why would OPEC shoot themselves in the foot to regain market share from US Shale, that will just as quickly be lost?  Possibly the U.S. hired OPEC to drop oil prices to put the hurt on Russia for the whole Ukraine/Crimea situation last year, which comes with the added benefit of boosting the US economy.** /r/KU76\n\n*I have been beating my head to understand how Russia ties into all this...I've been especially curious as to the recent deviation the Ruble has taken from the price of oil. Most recent signs say that Russia's economy is on the rebound...which doesn't make a whole lot of since in my book. If there are some behind the scenes maneuvering going on, I would say that Russia is doing really good at withstanding it so far, and that gives me more reason to suspect that this June meeting will maintain the current course, until some hurt starts really getting applied to where it is intended to be directed, be it shale or Russia.*\n\n**Also, the majority of new discoveries are shale, deepwater or tar sands. These all need oil around $100 to be viable.** /r/the_ultravixens\n\n*http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php\nJaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*\n\noil sands\n\n*Breakeven costs for existing projects such as Kearl Phase 1 stand at US$42 per barrel, with Husky’s Lloydminster (US$28), Cenvous’ Christina Lake ($26) and Suncor operations (US$30.3), all comfortably below WTI’s current price of US$46 per barrel, Citibank data shows.*\n\nDeepwater\n\n*the average breakeven oil price needed for new deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments in early stages of construction is between $65 and $75 per barrel. That “breakeven” implies a long-term annualized 10% return on capital.*\n\n*Now, there was a lot more money being thrown at all these projects when oil was over $100, and I do agree that there will be a lot less investment if oil stays, or decrease...but like a said, there has already been significant investment in projects to keep supply climbing for the next several years.*\n\n**If you look at the finances of the shale drillers, nobody was running a positive cashflow at $100 per barrel, so there is simply no way that breakevens are $45 outside of the most prolific core areas.** /r/the_ultravixens\n\n*I believe we agree that the most costly oil is deepwater...so I looked up Seadrill's EPS from Q1 '14, and it was $1.58...they most certainly were making money.*\n\n**Wind and solar provide around 1% of global energy, and it's all in the form of electricity. They currently do not fuel aeroplanes, trucks, boats or combine harvesters. In the timescales we're discussing (up to maybe 5-10 years max) they are irrelevant.** /r/the_ultravixens\n\n*You are right here, they are still in their infancies. This section is growing very quickly. The technology is growing, the infastucture is growing, and the efficiency is growing. I think it will still be ~3 decades before we are running off renewable energy...I'm hoping for sooner, but we will most certainly have enough oil to make it*", "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "created_utc": 1429462035.0, "tickers": [["WTI", 1]]}

I think the reason is, we were never told about a previous FTA, which began these changes, so we dont realize we're 20 years into them. We don't realize than in order to get back to where most of us think we are now, we not only have to prevent the new ones, we also have to extricate ourselves from the previous one. Or, we're going to be trapped in a global race to the bottom that will remake the world for the very wealthy to the detriment of everybody else. Its not enough for them that inequality remain where it is, in order to prevent positive change, they clearly feel they need to attack everything we hold dear, not just here, around the world. \n\nWhat needs to happen is *we need to figure out other, more positive models for globalization, and reject their WTO and \"investor rights trump all\" model. The people of the world need to put their heads together WITH business interests and figure out a win win plan for everybody. Not just mega corporations. Everybody. And this isnt it. \n\nBecause THIS (TPA-initiated-chain of events will happen on autopilot)- system absolutely cannot do anything good.  Its expresly designed NOT TO INTENTIONALLY, because if it did, then THAT would impede profits.  if you cannot sell the drug or the water to the highest bidder only, that impedes profits, doesnt it? **If you have to hire the local because he's the person who knows how to do the job and hes here, intead of forcing him to train his replacement,  that reduces profits.**\n\n See the problem?  Do the TPA, TAA, TISA, TPP, TTIP, WTO - it all must be rejected this week and every week until its gone. \n\nJust as CAFTA completely ignored human rights once enacted, TPP, TISA and TTIP are thoroughly anti-human rights, and TPA and TAA, being NATIONAL laws, are irrelevant to the FTAS. There is another way they are lying. They cannot tell us the truth which is the FTAs go above them and make them powerless, so they have focused on TPA which we should think of as a placebo button that simply starts a process that cannot be stopped which goes on autompilot and the rest is totally irrelevant and is only there to keep the people barking up the wrong tree for a year or three or four while the power to change things without doing the impossible, upsetting this whole system, which could not be done. Because its out of our hands once its created. the only time we can stop it is now, while the vote still exists in the people's hands. That is why the vote tomorrow or Tuesday. is SO IMPORTANT. \n\nLet me show you how much they are lying. \n\n[In this paper you can see how TISA is intended to serve as a laboratory](http://www.wti.org/fileadmin/user_upload/wti.org/institute/pdfs/S1793993314400067.pdf) for global services liberalisation.  Liberalisation means privatization and then globalization. That is the #1 goal. Making sure that firms, nomatter where they are from, who do basically everything, 70% of all jobs are services, \"everything you cannot drop on your foot\" - the priority will be getting the most work for the least money (i.e. living wage and sustainability ARE NOT ON THE MAPS AT ALL) And all \"discrimination\" that is relevant once this change occurrs, is discrimination against corporations by country. What that means is that an appropriate percentage of jobs MUST go to foreign firms or the WTO will step in and start eliminating rules which are perceived as standing in the way. \n\nGoogle phrases like \"WTO\" and \"Necessity Tests\" and \"No more burdensome than necessary\" to see what I mean.  You'll see that professional licensing requirements as well as citizenship or residence requirements will soon be difficult to defend at best and forbidden at worse in contexts where they have always been the norm. Why? because they block foreign firms who will suddenly become ***legally entitled*** to do the work IF they win it by their **\"competitive advantage\"**, low cost. \n\nThings like minimum wages, will be under attack. That is, if they even apply (Since the firms will be foreign and their workers presence here \"temporary\" - less than a few years in any single case, it is possible that they may not, they currently may not with L1 visas based on GATS, it seems. \n\nIn any case, it seems almost no Americans understand this important shift of frame or its implications.)   In the world at large, there has been little in the way of progress on human rights since the WTO was brought into being and it could be argued we've actually gone backwards. SO DONT EXPECT THINGS TO GET BETTER, ENDORSING THIS SYSTEM IS GUARANTEED TO MAKE THINGS WORSE. \n\nHow it is intended to transition huge chunks of the economy into WTO control. What this means is that schools and colleges health care payment (insurance) and health care, and and banking and water and public works and literally everything currently done by the governments FFORDABLY will be forced to be MONETIZED and in that context it will become affordable and in the process in the quest for affordability the fix will be crap-ification inside of GPA. All those government jobs and a lot of non-government contracts will be required to use the WTO's [General procurement Agreement](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gpa_1994_e.htm) in selecting contractors. \n\nThe winning bid will be the lowest bid. \n\n**Also, any kinds of local discrimination (for example, selecting women owned or minority firms or preferring local firms, is only allowed in poor countries, rich countries have to just take the winning bids.)**  See Technical Barriers to Trade web page. And READ EVERY WORD CRITICALLY because a lot of change can be contained in a few innocuous looking words **YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR TRADE LINGO, YOU HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT THERE, NO WORDS MEAN WHAT THEY SEEM TO MEAN.**\n\n**I cannot over emphasize this- the legal standard is that NO law or regulation can be allowed that has the effect of inhibiting trade, - the legal standard is  \"no more burdensome than necessary\"**  \n\n***That means this shift will literally turn our world upside down.***\n\nAlso, get those frames where you expect jobs to go to Americans out of your mind, they likely wont. After all, we have to charge more. Because of our costs of living. \n\n**The winning bids will come from the countries with the most favorable regulatory environment, meaning in many cases, the lowest wages. They will do work here.

Our first location started out gangbusters and quickly lost money due to bad labor and cost of goods. We opened a second shortly after the first due to the opportunity and our perceived momentum. As a brand we were attractive to investment and my original minority partner (I am still majority owner) picked up what could be considered an angel investor. He helped fund a third store in which we dumped significant investment. Since then we have also opened a fourth store. I know there is so much wrong with what I have written so far as in terms of growth before prime costs are achieved and how that is a bad idea. I get that. I can answer a bunch of questions about the above individually as asked.\n\nMy major dilemma now is the angel investor. While still a minority shareholder I allowed his money to influence aspects of the business and while fighting him on his worst ideas allowed some in as i didnt see the long term harm in some of them.He has zero restaurant experience and he likes to have me impart ideas from what he sees elsewhere. He decided all restaurants needed a GM and KM. One or two locations can support that but the others cannot support two salaries easily. Wanted to offer breakfast. We did. We didnt see booming sales in a month so we closed it. He must have had a good time at a sports bar so our original and most under performing location of course needs to turn into a sports bar. He is pissed ass the Superbowl launch was not packed to the gils. There are plenty more examples but we are running out of money and he is threatening to take over.

Mr Ben-Artzi said the fine should be paid by individual executives, not shareholders, and suggested the “revolving door” of senior personnel between the SEC and Germany’s largest bank had played a role in executives going unpunished. “This goes beyond the typical revolving-door story,” Mr Ben-Artzi wrote in an opinion article for the Financial Times. “In this case, top SEC lawyers had held senior posts at the bank, moving in and out of top positions at the SEC even as the investigations into malfeasance at Deutsche Bank were ongoing.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1471550079.0, "tickers": [["DB", 1]]}

People with low amounts of money can invest but it's an extremely low percentage of investments. As prices of rent continuing to go up and insurance being a LAW(WTF already right there). It will be an even lower percentage of people being able to invest or save any money due to it being to hard to live and save anything. It is a capitalist system that will inevitably become a slave work system. Meaning you will only make enough money to eat and go back to standard living without any form of entertainment because you will not be able to afford it.

I'll also say that economists have a pretty awful record when it comes to predicting economic downturns.\nI'm starting to feel a little uneasy about the UK economy for several reasons (not just Brexit) and have carried out some research. Some of this research has lead me to believe that even worse problems are appearing in the US and China as well.\n\nMy reasons:\nA few large housing construction clients have recently started delaying payments to My company (and others) and have even written this into all new contracts. Looking at the financial statements of these companies has shown that they hold a disproportionate amount of property in London. A potentially related issue is that house prices in London have stalled (and reversed in some areas). A deeper look at the UK economy shows that the UK House price / earnings ratio is currently 5.73%, a 2nd only to the all time high in mid 2007 (that date sounds familiar). \n\nQuick research:\nI then looked at UK personal debt and you guessed it, currently running at an almost all time high of 126% of income. Therefore it is not unexpected to find that consumer spending is almost £60,000,000,000 more than the consumer disposable income. Personal savings are currently 1.7% and have dropped significantly since last May (possibly to cover gap between disposable income and spending).\n\nBefore I lose every bodies attention by spouting numbers, I should note some of the reasons behind the 2007/2008 recession:\n\n-Low interest rates meaning more people believing they can afford homes out of their reach\n\n-Government backed mortgage schemes\n\n-Lax regulation of lending\n\nIt is worth noting that in the UK at least, these are all true. Low interest rates are leading to high inflation and must rise eventually. The government ‘help to buy’ scheme has increased the potential for risky lending. The regulations for lenders are much firmer than in 2007, but in the last budget some of this was reversed.\nI have not considered other countries in as much detail, but have noticed the US housing market has effectively stalled (I’m not sure about the historical performance of this and should look at it again in the future). China’s economic data has been taking a downward turn for many years, which is a bad sign, especially as its debt to GDP ratio is increasing fast.\n\nWhen will it happen?\nLarge economic downturns are often caused by a bubble in a market (i.e. housing, fad companies etc). A few potential hazard areas to look out for could be:\n\n- Car finance market is vastly overpriced and could burst at any time\n\n- housing market (again)\n\n- tech company bubble. Are facebook, twitter, etc worth anything (never mind the Billions they are listed as)?\n\n-credit / storecard lenders. It’s worth noting that Provident are massively struggling at the moment and might well go under (caused by unrelated circumstances, but may be a trigger).\n\nAs I said this is just my interpretation of the data and I may be finding correlation that is not relevant. If anyone has a better insight into this, or knows more about economics than I do, I’d be happy to hear your opinion.\n\n", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "created_utc": 1503442233.0, "tickers": [["FB", 1], ["TWTR", 1]]}

I give the system the name of \"Zen\".\n\nThe system use 9 types of money:\n\nGold Ren, Silver Ten and Copper Sen are 3 precious metal Grasshopper shape coin in pure Gold (4.00g), Silver (3.00g) and Copper (2.00g) that have different mechanical propriety according to the fineness of the coin which is usefull for fineness verification. And it can be printed by anyone with a 3D metal printer with the right fineness precious metal powder.\n\nGolden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen are 3-in-1 cryptocurrency that use the golden ratio (1.618...), the silver ratio (2.414...) and bronze ratio (3.303...) to simulate the supply of physical Gold, Silver and Copper. And where the standard weight (in grams of the cryptocurrency) of a coin unit is calculated at each block and change automatically so each coin always have the correct fineness (% fees) with the possibility to access and recieve any coin with one private key. And it's possible by a global consenus to back the value of the coins to the physical coins (for exemple 1 YEN = 1 REN). And the network will find by itself the best weight for the cryptocoins to satistfy the backing without the need of an centralized Supply/Demande exchange to calculate the value of the coins.\n\nY-Network, K-Network and J-Network are 3-in-1 Channel Factories build on top of Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen where anyone in the network can melt down their coins to grams and make instant 100% pure grams (zero fee) to any person in the network and at the end remint the grams to standard coins. And the network nodes are station unit called Zen Towers that offer the exchange of all the 9 types of money with providing cellular 5G/Wifi node. And with the offering of physical coin exchange will make the channel distributed around the earth with no centralized hubs/nodes.\n\nIn this monetary system, the do(Zen)al base is used for pricing good and services. The dozenal or the numerical base 12 make counting, addition, substraction, multiplication and division of prices easy which make it the most efficient base for commerce and trading.\n\nTo learn more please visit: http://wmjtj2j57mcvs7ms.onion/\n\nI will just add a comment that, in the actual computer architecture with hierarchical memory and wire based internet communication. There is a possibility that Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen will fail at some point even with automatic block size (or density) adaptation and channel factories. So if there is an implementation of it in the actual architecture I will see it only as an \"Experiment\". It's a good thing because it will prepare us for the real implementation on the next generation machines.\n\nThe Golden Yen, Silver Ken and Bronze Jen need a machine/computer/smartphone/smarthing with pool of fast memristors base memory connecter with a photonic fiber to a pool of highly parralizable and specialized CPU that communicate with other similar peers with an external high bandwidth cellular base wireless communication.\n\nHewlett Packard Corporation have already made some research about this type of machine. For many years they havent give it a name yet, they call it only \"The Machine\". (I believe because it's my destiny to name it... just kidding HP! Dont take it seriously! Dont sue me! :P).\n\nI give it that type of machine the name of \"Nen\" the same name as the Human Enhancer Technology introduced by M. The decentralized and anonymous high speed cellular internet build on top of Nen including the 3 cryptocurrency the name of \"Zen\". And the decentralized and distributed Global Brain Machine build on top of Nen and Zen, where anyone can share their memories and CPU for grams in a Hashgraph like protocol and where anyone can do anything he can imagined like store or compute data, search, play, collaborate. I give that World Machine the name of \"Den\".\n\nThis still in research and development project is open to anyone.

{"name": "t3_8aub92", "title": "Bubbles Bubbles everywhere ...", "text": "Economics is not an exact science. It has many theories and hypotheses from many different types of ideas and philosophies. The reason why economics is not an exact science is because every economist is trying to predict human behavior. In fact, the number one thing you must learn, in order to understand economics, is an assumption. You must assume that the actor in the economic model is rational. So, how can we make precise models when we know that not everyone is completely rational? The answer is, we don't, and that is why there are a number of competing ideologies and philosophies within the study of economics.\n\nOne idea that sticks out to me, given the current conditions, is the Austrian School of Economics. These economists felt that too much liquidity, and easy access to capital results in higher risk taking, and malinvestments. The idea is that if it is easy to get capital, then individuals with capital are prone to taking on more risk, without doing the proper research and due diligence required to make a good decision. The incentive to make perfect investment decisions diminishes, if an investor or company only needs to get more capital to stay afloat. \n\nSince the Great Recession, we have had extremely low interest rates, and extremely high levels of liquidity. Investing conditions have never been easier, and I think this has a direct link to stock market performance, private investments, and alternative investments like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The rise of unicorn companies such as Uber, the high valuation of Tesla without profits, the FAANG trade, and the rise of cryptocurrencies can all be attributed to the ease of monetary conditions. And now, the punch bowl is going to be taken away.\n\nAs the Fed starts to raise interest rates and taper off its bond repurchases, liquidity is going to dry up. Markets as a whole, such as the stock market, and the bond market, are probably not in bubbles, but there are definitely bubbly assets. Stocks like AMZN with a 307 P/E ratio, and NFLX with a 206 P/E ratio are bubbles. How can any investor expect profitability to catch up with these share prices in the near future; a recession will come well before that.

OPEC ministers failed to promise a reduction in production, while the Joint Technical Committee forecasted a production growth. The whole situation has caused major panic in the markets. Since Wednesday, oil has been steadily recovering, but it has not yet managed to fight back to even half of Tuesday’s decline, not to mention the whole 28% collapse.\n\n**2. Bitcoin experienced a crash on Wednesday.** Many months of sluggish dynamics turned into a sharp sell-off, when the key cryptocurrency fell under the $6000 mark. At the end of the week, BTCUSD was traded near $5500, which roughly corresponds to the cost of electricity required for its production.\n\n**3.

It seems that for the last month, positive drivers are struggling to push the market to a sustainable trend for growth.\n\nCrude Oil experienced a sharp and unexpected reversal to a decline on Tuesday.

Markets are fearing that the slowdown in the world economy will slow the growth of oil consumption, nevertheless production is significantly increasing. Oil drilling in the United States is growing, and thus the American WTI is experiencing a great deal of pressure, falling to lows seen back in November 2017, while Brent is at 8-months lows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there are a few things that allow us to remain optimistic about the stock markets, at least for a while.

{"name": "t3_dtkai8", "title": "I have a question for real economists out there. I play a very deep game with a rich and complex economy. We are a very large alliance (20k) with a big self-regulated market. Two of us have had a long standing argument about what is best....", "text": "First some background and information.\n\nWe play Eve Online. Eve Online has a complex market economy because all of the goods are made by players and sold by players on open markets, which are stations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online#Economy All NPC stations have a market and some player stations can have a market if that module is installed. Here are some places you can see the market live: https://www.evemarkethelper.net/, https://evemarketer.com/, https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore . On the market you can trade both raw goods and components up to and including finished products. Each of these fluctuate based on whatever players want to charge for the items. Here you can see the cost of a Stealth Bomber and each of these is an order to sell and on the bottom are the orders to buy. https://evemarketer.com/types/12032. You can change the orders every 5 minutes and change the price to go up or down, etc. The interesting thing is that you can buy Plex with real money, and then sell that on the market for in game currency. So that market is pretty active. Basically 1 billion ISK = $10USD. When I talk about prices below, people can buy something on our market for 5c and then up the price to 50c-1USD, and that is common.\n\n**Here is the setup**\n\nWe are in an alliance of several thousand people. We live outside of the normal area and maintain our own market. This market is only accessible by people in our alliance. Side note that spys can join our alliance and mess up the market as well. The movement of going from where we live to where the main market hubs are is considerable. So to stock our market we either have to 1. build it locally, 2. buy it at a market hub and have it shipped down, 3. find it out doing PVE activities. Our market has unreasonably higher prices on most items. So if you take the market hub price and add shipping, tax, effort .. that would be some random price. The price in our market is 1000s of % higher than that. This is not healthy because lots of the things that people need to buy on our market need to be bought quickly and that forces them to pay insanely high prices.\n\n**Here is the problem**\n\nSome players buy things on our market and then relist them back on our market for some random price that they want. They will buy all of said item, and then relist said item for 1000% of the original price. This may or may not be caught by someone who can actually fix the issue by having more of the item shipped down from a market hub and then putting them up for a slightly higher than previous price. The relister can then buy all of that item again and at to their personal stock, thus keeping the monopoly on the item and the price.\n\n**Here is my view**\n\nPeople who relist on our personal market are adding a \"personal tax\" to items and creating waves of effort by others to correct their greed. People who relist are leeches because there is no retribution on leadership's side. They just buy them all, change the price, and then if and when someone challenges their monopoly they can just lower their price again. The people who needed the items between those times must pay the exorbitant price that he set. I think this behavior causes people to NOT want to participate in the market and the price gouging causes several problems. Price gouging causes people to not buy items out of spite. It is a non-team way to play the game and try to help our alliance.\n\n**Here is my buddy's view**\n\nIf person A lists an item for profit and then person B buys all of the item and then relists them, everyone wins. Person A has made a profit and Person B has created opportunity to undercut him. So either person A can go buy more of said item and then list them for an undercut price or someone else can see the high prices and that person can ship in more items, thus creating more items on the market.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nOur market has allowed relisting for several years. Our market is not in a good place. Thousands of items are marked up extensively and this causes all sorts of fallout. Their aren't that many people relisting, because mainly its seen as bad teamplay and morally wrong. Neither me or my buddy are economists, but he keeps using all of these random macroeconomics theories and whatnot, I think its horse pucky.

Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax,\" wrote Smith.\n\n***\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html\n#How FedEx Cut Its Tax Bill to $0\n*By Jim Tankersley, Peter Eavis and Ben Casselman\nNov. 15, 2019*\n\nWASHINGTON — In the 2017 fiscal year, FedEx owed more than $1.5 billion in taxes. The next year, it owed nothing. What changed was the Trump administration’s tax cut — for which the company had lobbied hard.\n\nThe public face of its lobbying effort, which included a tax proposal of its own, was FedEx’s founder and chief executive, Frederick Smith, who repeatedly took to the airwaves to champion the power of tax cuts. “If you make the United States a better place to invest, there is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment,” he said on an August 2017 radio show hosted by Larry Kudlow, who is now chairman of the National Economic Council.\n\nFour months later, President Trump signed into law the $1.5 trillion tax cut that became his signature legislative achievement. FedEx reaped big savings, bringing its effective tax rate from 34 percent in fiscal year 2017 to less than zero in fiscal year 2018, meaning that, overall, the government technically owed it money. But it did not increase investment in new equipment and other assets in the fiscal year that followed, as Mr. Smith said businesses like his would.\n\nNearly two years after the tax law passed, the windfall to corporations like FedEx is becoming clear. A New York Times analysis of data compiled by Capital IQ shows no statistically meaningful relationship between the size of the tax cut that companies and industries received and the investments they made. If anything, the companies that received the biggest tax cuts increased their capital investment by less, on average, than companies that got smaller cuts.\n\nFedEx’s financial filings show that the law has so far saved it at least $1.6 billion. Its financial filings show it owed no taxes in the 2018 fiscal year overall. Company officials said FedEx paid $2 billion in total federal income taxes over the past 10 years.\n\nAs for capital investments, the company spent less in the 2018 fiscal year than it had projected in December 2017, before the tax law passed. It spent even less in 2019. Much of its savings have gone to reward shareholders: FedEx spent more than $2 billion on stock buybacks and dividend increases in the 2019 fiscal year, up from $1.6 billion in 2018, and more than double the amount the company spent on buybacks and dividends in fiscal year 2017.\n\nA spokesman said it was unfair to judge the effect of the tax cuts on investment by looking at year-to-year changes in the company’s capital spending plans.\n\n“FedEx invested billions in capital items eligible for accelerated depreciation and made large contributions to our employee pension plans,” the company said in a statement. “These factors have temporarily lowered our federal income tax, which was the law’s intention to help grow G.D.P., create jobs and increase wages.”\n\nFedEx’s use of its tax savings is representative of corporate America. Companies have already saved upward of $100 billion more on their taxes than analysts predicted when the law was passed. Companies that make up the S&P 500 index had an average effective tax rate of 18.1 percent in 2018, down from 25.9 percent in 2016, according to an analysis of securities filings. More than 200 of those companies saw their effective tax rates fall by 10 points or more. Nearly three dozen, including FedEx, saw their tax rates fall to zero or reported that tax authorities owed them money.\n\nFrom the first quarter of 2018, when the law fully took effect, companies have spent nearly three times as much on additional dividends and stock buybacks, which boost a company’s stock price and market value, than on increased investment.\n\n***\n\nhttps://about.van.fedex.com/newsroom/statement-from-frederick-w-smith-chairman-and-ceo-of-fedex-corporation/\n#Statement from Frederick W. Smith, Chairman and CEO of FedEx Corporation\n*November 17, 2019*\n\nThe New York Times published a distorted and factually incorrect story on the front page of the Sunday, November 17 edition concerning FedEx and our billions of dollars of tax payments and billions of dollars of investments in the U.S. economy.  Pertinent to this outrageous distortion of the truth is the fact that unlike FedEx, the New York Times paid **zero** federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of $111 million, and only $30 million in 2018 – 18% of their pretax book income.  Also in 2018 the New York Times cut their capital investments nearly in half to $57 million, which equates to a rounding error when compared to the $6 billion of capital that FedEx invested in the U.S. economy during that same year.\n\nI hereby challenge A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington, DC with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax.  The focus of the debate should be federal tax policy and the relative societal benefits of business investments and the enormous intended benefits to the United States economy, especially lower and middle class wage earners.\n\nI look forward to promptly hearing from Mr. Sulzberger and scheduling this open event to bring further public awareness of the facts related to these important issues.", "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "created_utc": 1574074772.0, "tickers": [["IQ", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_ebb2rv", "title": "How to model money generation in a closed economic system?", "text": "Hello, fellow redditors;\n\nFor some time I've been living with this problem that I can't find the solution either by thinking about it nor looking online. By firstly known that I have absolutely no background in economic science knowledge, but a strong academic background in mathematical tools to understand such model. The thing is that a few years ago I tried to create a toy model by myself that didn't pursue the goal of being realistic at all but giving me some cool graphs and statistics to analyze for fun. So I'm going to describe briefly this model to, hopefully, give you guys an idea of what I'm thinking of.\n\nThis model in question had several goods forming a chain of production that eventually got bought by \"the people\". I don't remember the specifics of the chain but it could be that there are two goods (call them A and B) that can either be bought directly by the people or combined to form a more valuable good C that can be bought too by the people. The specifics of the rules that I came up to recreate this are of no importance to the problem here, let's just say that the \"factories\" that produced these goods could alter their amount production depending on the demand and the price also varies according to this. So in the end, there is a dynamical system where both supply (the factories directly change this) and the demand (the people can get out of money and stop buying something) vary as too does the price.\n\nThe problem is what follows: not everybody cand earn money at the same time. This is a zero-sum situation. If A, B and the people have benefits is in the expense of C, which is losing it. Being in my model the control of production tied to this benefits (they decrease if the factory loses money) it leads to immediate collapse of the system in little time so, in the end, the solution I came up was to introduce \"the government\" which had it own demand and just unlimited cash to pay for it. What I found out is that the system was pretty sensitive to the amount of cash introduced by the government. If too few the system collapsed anyway, but too much and the prices went up exponentially (literally).\n\nI understand that the introduction of money in the system is something that has to be modelled somehow. In the end, money is a representation of the value generated by the economy and in each step of the chain of production, this value is increased. But the question here is how to do it. I think that the government thing is a gross simplification of central banks emitting money but how can be measured the right quantity of money to be created and the best way to introduce it in a simple model like mine?\n\nI'd appreciate any help that is specific to enlight me in this problem, but also any read on the matter that you think could interest me. As I said I have no economic education so most of the times that I look something up I end up finding out that I just don't know the technical terms to look for it and I just find a generic explanation. What I look for is a mathematical model or at least something I can take simple equations from. For example, if I look for something like \"economic models\" I just find thins that talk about the played-out curves of supply and demand which are of absolutely no help to me. I know it must be a name to the model I try to recreate but I just don't know it...", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1576475669.0, "tickers": [["C", 1], ["B", 1]]}

This is known as quantitative easing. In total, give or take $3.8 trillion has been printed since 08.\n\nA couple of years back, in 2017, the Fed started to unwind its balance sheet (known as quantitative tightening).\n\nHowever, that changed in dramatic fashion this year, as the Repo crisis reared it's ugly head.\n\nBasically the Fed stepped in on an emergency (supposedly short term) basis due to a lack of liquidity in the market. However, some banks (unnamed for obvious reasons) were still struggling to find the cash they needed to hit their reserve ratios - this is a consequence of fractional reserve banking.\n\nVery recently, this has been ramped up even more, with another $425 billion being injected into the system before year-end.\n\nOf course, this is just an emergency measure for a few months since September, and *does not* constitute quantitative easing, even though the impact on the Fed's balance sheet is in effect the same (lol)...\n\nNow, enough of the Fed and Repos, let's look at corporate debt:\n\nSo, as I mentioned before, corporate debt is pretty high - nearly $10 trillion and 47% of the overall economy.\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12-1028731031](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12-1028731031)\n\nSome say that companies are using this record level of corporate debt to continue to finance the cash on their balance sheets necessary for stock buybacks, and not using this debt to invest in the REAL WORLD economy.\n\nHence, the vast amounts of cash corporations have had on their balance sheets has been holding up equity markets, with the **main demand for equities over the last decade coming from corporate stock buybacks**.\n\nSo, in essence, companies are using the extra cash on their balance sheets to buy their shares and keep them propped up, while recently there has been near record insider selling.\n\nCorporations are not using this extra debt to invest in the REAL world economy, they are instead using it to supplement stock buybacks.\n\nThe best thing is that while they continue with stock buybacks to keep the share price propped up, they are selling their personal shares in the business and lining the pockets with profits.\n\nThus, they personally position themselves defensively and hedge - such that when the recession hits in the next 1-2 years, retail and 401k investors take the main hit.\n\nThe insiders are already out - and of course the tax payers through FED hyperinflation will bail the dead company or economy out...\n\nThus, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.\n\nSome say this will lead to a major credit freeze soon, more quantitative easing and the banks will need MASSIVE capital injections along with potentially negative rates.\n\nThe bottom line is that one should be prepared.\n\nBearin' in mind (get it...) what I said before about the main demand for equities over the last decade coming from corporate stock buybacks, it is telling that in the **second quarter of 2019 we saw a** **significant decline**.\n\nSome say \"just ride the wave, the Fed is printing more, equities go up\".\n\nTo me, the risk/reward is not worthwhile here. Like I said, since 08, we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history and we've had a return of \\~360%. The only other period that had the same return (it was slightly higher actually) was the roaring 20s. We all know what happened after that! No, I am not being a doomer and saying we will have another Great Depression 😂\n\nHowever, what is interesting is that Central Banks played a large role in the 20s which lead to problems later down the line...\n\nSo, we have painted a clear picture - the writing is on the wall...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOywhOUZD04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOywhOUZD04)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBRAVE BROWSER: [https://brave.com/fin894](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=FOywhOUZD04&redir_token=HZPVFewQdyiVauLKedDD2RU12YF8MTU3NjYxMDU2OEAxNTc2NTI0MTY4&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbrave.com%2Ffin894&event=video_description)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1577089863.0, "tickers": [["REAL", 3]]}

{"name": "t3_f9s9xo", "title": "China, Poverty, and Practical Ethical Sourcing", "text": "Discussions of ethical sourcing tend to be very narrow, which is a problem because *the ethics of production sourcing operate very differently in the macro versus the micro*. On the micro, we obviously have a preference for sending business to factories that pay good wages, offer benefits, etc., but on the macro the competitive pricing of impoverished geographies with cheap labor attracts money that lifts entire populations out of poverty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Using 2011 PPP dollars, data sources at end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ebu0mi4je9j41.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3c585544bf58e0a0aeaa67dc9d6101c67435d74)\n\nTo illustrate this point, I’m going to walk through bare-bones of how farsighted policymakers in China and global demand (especially US demand) for cheap production from 1990–2014 combined to form *the largest movement of human beings out of poverty in history*. Then, I want to briefly discuss how to merge the macro and micro picture of sourcing ethics to form a framework that I think leaves two routes for companies to approach “practical ethical sourcing”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Macro Ethics: What China Did\n\nHere’s a very simplistic account of what happened with China since 1990. The competitive advantage of cheap labor and production allowed Chinese businesses to grow massively, selling to other countries who outsourced their production to Chinese factories. This created a positive trade balance (how much more a country exports than it imports), which meant a large positive “current account” for China (trade balance plus a few other metrics of income from other countries).\n\nGenerally speaking, this kind of competitive advantage erodes in two ways:\n\n1. **Your currency gets more expensive, which raises production costs in foreign currency terms.** This happens because exporters are selling goods in large quantities to foreign countries (let’s use US entities as the base case here). Those exporters get dollars for their goods, and then have to buy yuan with those dollars to pay production costs in China. *Basically this means a whole lot of dollars being sold to buy yuan, pushing the price of the yuan up.*\n2. **Wages rise.** This happens because export businesses see such good demand that they keep cropping up and keep hiring until all the cheap labor is basically hired, and then they start pricing the labor more competitively with each other and driving up labor costs (wages). *Basically more demand for workers in China means higher wages in China.*\n\nChinese policy makers knew this was going to happen, and thought “we don’t want a strong currency, we want a middle class,” so they began offsetting the upward pressure on the yuan by accumulating reserves — mostly dollar reserves. This meant that rather than being eroded through currency appreciation, the competitive advantage would be eroded through increasing wages (see “Appreciation Note” at end).\n\nSo how does this work? The Chinese government needs to sell a lot of yuan for dollars — enough to counter the buying pressure from all the export income being used to buy yuan.\n\nThe way this mechanically works is the Chinese government goes out and buys enough US government bonds to offset the the massive inflow. They sell yuan for dollars to buy US bonds, and the yuan stays flat against the dollar instead of rising. The Chinese government can make as much yuan as they want, so there’s no reason to bet that they’d run out of yuan to sell.\n\nYou’ll notice a few things in the chart below: the overall scale of both grows massively over the time period, and they grow roughly in line with each-other as reserve purchases offset the current account income. The reserve accumulation here is outpacing current account inflows in part because there are additional pressures to offset at times (foreign investment), and in part because I’m proxying it with an imperfect solution that will capture some appreciation of the reserves (see “Analytics Note” at end for explanations of this and some other important analytical choices like why this isn’t in GDP terms, etc.). You’ll also notice the picture gets a little messy in the post-crisis period, which makes sense as global demand constricted and capital flows got kind of wack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Data sources at the end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/35s1wv4le9j41.jpg?width=484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac80c67d5b7190969329f184d788780ac2723944)\n\nIn the early nineties, the Chinese government had unified the swap and official exchange rate, creating a 33% devaluation overnight, and then began to directly intervene in the currency’s value. Because the government was buying dollars (selling yuan) at the same rate that the exporters (and others) were buying yuan (selling dollars) the yuan avoided rapid appreciation. Instead, they allowed it to just make slow and steady gains over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Data sources at the end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0lwzjweme9j41.jpg?width=482&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2ad09caed8844ba17a8e233a9ef442d43723ee6)\n\nThe impact of this was that China retained a competitive advantage in the export market for longer than it otherwise would, and the advantage would only erode through rising wages. As continued demand for cheap production meant expansion of production facilities, new jobs, and demand for workers, wage competition took over and started to improve the income of Chinese workers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Data sources at the end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3i7miysne9j41.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=477b201ac9535f92512a711e599d5d71236caa01)\n\nThis wage increase means more money every month for a previously impoverished segment of the world population — a massive impact in terms of human well-being.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Using 2011 PPP dollars, data sources at end\\)](https://preview.redd.it/m7dhig9pe9j41.jpg?width=487&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c993f074c536f3a6bdd3a9a89ed1a1da08a585)\n\nNothing like that, on that sort of scale, has ever happened. But, things like that do happen on smaller scales in smaller countries all the time when competitive export pricing allows them to increase their wealth through global export markets and policymakers make good choices.\n\nIf you care about wealth inequality in a global sense, and about redistribution of wealth to poorer nations, then a lot of good is done by globalization of supply chains and demand for cheap labor (to the degree that this can ultimately translate to higher wages over time). Market dynamics distributing demand to geographies with cheap production can lift entire populations out of poverty. Today, the countries this most aptly applies to are the cohort of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc.\n\n*Does this justify human rights violations?*\n\nNo. It does not.\n\n*Were early industrial revolution coal mining towns that verged on slave labor “fair game” because they increased the wealth of the population over a few generations?*\n\nNo.\n\nThat macro picture is all well and good, but as individuals who are decision-makers on these things, we have our own moral obligation to maintain a threshold of ethical treatment regardless of the optimization of profits. Pay attention to what your factories do, of course, and don’t work with people who dehumanize their workers.\n\nThe take-away of the macro picture is just this:\n\n*Cheap isn’t evil. Evil is evil.*\n\nSo, how do we resolve this macro picture with obvious micro-ethical factors as we decide how to support better working conditions and avoid flagrant exploitation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Practical Ethical Sourcing and Where You Have Impact\n\nDespite the example above, you are not doing the world any particular positive good by choosing cheap factories. Unless you are in charge of manufacturing for a massive company that is a driver of the global market, your choices don’t move the needle on this dynamic. Whether or not you outsource your factory to a poorer country with cheaper labor, those large orders that do have an impact are driven by publicly traded companies whose decision makers, while [not actually legally bound](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/corporations-dont-have-to-maximize-profits) to maximize profitability, generally only have their job if they continue to do so. Demand will funnel to cheap production.\n\n*Does that mean that your choices have no impact at all?*\n\nNo not necessarily.\n\nTo synthesize: there are functionally two ways to run a good, impactful business with “Practical Ethical Sourcing”:\n\n**Version 1:** Go with a competitive production option, and make sure between comparably costed options you pick one that doesn’t have specific practices you find unacceptable (i.e. meets your threshold criteria for ethical practices). For example — refuse to work with factories that employ child labor (and make your own list of other practices you won’t tolerate). This is where *most* businesses who are primarily focused on product and producing value for customers, but also want to maintain ethical standards they are comfortable with, should operate. There is already pressure against most of the worst manufacturing processes, and by consciously avoiding giving evil factories your business you can participate in the process of “starving them out” of the global export market. You are having an impact through who you *don’t* give money to.\n\n**Version 2:** Give your production orders to someone so ethically focused and otherwise non-competitive that orders coming from you are a needle-mover on their probability of survival. To really work it has to be the primary focus of your business and brand, such that you can target your branding materials toward the audience who is willing to spend the premium to cover the additional cost of your “super-ethical” production (or else it isn’t sustainable as a business). The basis of the impact here relies on the fact that the factory is uncompetitive outside of a willingness to pay an ethical premium, so you probably need to be non-competitively priced for retail to maintain margins — which means finding the consumers willing to pay that premium. As an example: T-shirts made form recycled tired tires might not be the best Ts, or the cheapest, but you can make it your business to find the people willing to buy them and generate income for the people who make them. You are having an impact by who you *do* give money to.\n\nIt’s usually a problem if a business is falling somewhere in the spectrum between Version 1 and Version 2. They run the risk of either being\n\n1. **More about storytelling than impact** — maybe they advertise the fact that they produce in a high-wage geography (as though that is necessarily morally superior) or generally inflate the benefits of insignificant production choices (a lot of B Corps are like this; I’m considering writing an article about B Corps and how little that means), or\n2. **A bad business that won’t sustain itself, and therefore wont have lasting impact** — maybe they are trying to sell products with expensive, alternative, hyper-ethical production processes at competitive retail prices to the general market (possibly, in that case, funding a good brand and broken unit economics with VC money that will inevitably run out).\n\nAt [r/MeritStore](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeritStore/), we’re thinking through these problems in real time as we make sourcing decisions. For us, we think the best way is to set an ethical standard of practices we are unwilling to participate in, and then within those reasonable constraints source cost effective production. Looking at factories, we aren’t throwing out certain options simply because the wages there are low compared to the US.\n\nWe plan to make sure that we’re ethically comfortable with the factories we use to produce — for our own sake. We want to make a good business that brings great value to our consumers, and doesn’t compromise our ethics. I hope anyone interested in assessing the ethical promise of brands found value in this perspective, and I especially hope it is useful to anyone out there who is trying to navigate their own production sourcing decisions.\n\nI know that this perspective doesn’t harmonize with some of the ethical “ra-ra”ing around certain brands. I’m trying to think this through with data, basic principles, and an eye towards the practical realities of running a business. I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — \n\nIf you’re interested, come join the discussion at [r/MeritStore](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeritStore/)\n\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nData Sources:\n\n[https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/gdp-per-capita](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/gdp-per-capita)\n\n[http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/CHN](http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/CHN)\n\n[https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/China/](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/China/)\n\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\n*Appreciation Note: You can make the contention that an rising yuan is equivalent to increasing wages, but in effect that is only true to the degree that the wage-earner is buying imports. Wage inflation through a tight labor market more effectively redistributes income share from business owners to workers, while currency appreciation simply has a deflationary impact through diminished import costs (and probably a more positive impact on large holders of Yuan denominated assets who are already wealthy enough to spend abroad).*\n\n*Analytics Note: (1) I’m using YoY change in FX reserves incl. Gold as my “Reserve Accumulation”. This is not a perfect approximation of the flow I would ideally use (reserve purchases) because of reserve asset (especially non-dollar reserve asset) price movements. I think it’s a reasonable enough proxy for the purposes of this post. (2) I also don’t mean to totally ignore other flows and pressures, but won’t do the full balance of payments analysis needed to paint the whole picture — in this case most notably the rest of the capital account. It would only be to demonstrate why these are the important flows I’m talking about. I fear losing the reader’s interest going through why a bunch of other things aren’t the important thing. (3) In this case not doing in GDP terms because I also want to get across the point that the whole scale of the current account and the reserve accumulation is growing. (4) If anyone here has done BoP analysis they’re probably foaming about the fact that the outflows aren’t negative. I thought that might confuse some people, so I didn’t do it. (5) I’m focusing on 1990–2015 because in 2015 some of this dynamic shifted, as there was enough pressure of wealthy folks moving money out of china that the government actually started to sell some reserves (and devalued the yuan 1.5%). The fact that enough people in China had enough money to cause problems with outflows (as well as bust up some real estate markets like Vancouver and Sydney) actually shows that the policy worked.*", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1582719042.0, "tickers": [["B", 2], ["VC", 1]]}

They are not only at risk from the spread of the virus itself but also from the responses of the government, both local and national.\n\nHomeless communities are highly social environments. Many encampments around the country are home to hundreds of people living in close quarters. Unlike formal residences, these informal settlements lack appropriate access to sanitation services. Running water, toilets, and even soap are not easily accessible to homeless people. [Public health officials are calling for social distancing and limited gatherings to slow the spread of the virus](https://www.newsweek.com/dr-anthony-fauci-says-he-would-like-dramatic-reduction-personal-interactions-social-1492410), but the reality is that many people are totally unable to do these things. This is all the more true for the homeless.\n\nWhile the national response to the Coronavirus pandemic has been [slow](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/03/coronavirus-flawed-cdc-testing-kits-slowed-us-results/4930932002/) and [ineffective](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-coronavirus-response-fail-959868/), state and local efforts to combat the virus have also been problem-ridden. Such efforts are still far short of the seriousness of the crisis. Governments of the SF Bay Area have created [some local ordinances](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-san-francisco-emergency-mayor-london-breed/) to address the crisis. The City of Berkeley has placed [some hand washing stations at its largest encampments](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/13/berkeley-sets-up-22-hand-washing-stations-to-help-the-homeless-and-others-from-getting-coronavirus). Berkeley has even [leased land](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/02/26/mayor-wants-to-turn-homeless-camp-near-seabreeze-market-into-official-outdoor-shelter) to one homeless community, known as the “Seabreeze” community in West Berkeley, temporarily shielding them from further displacement and earmarking the community for expanded city services. However, these are mere pittances which do next to nothing to protect the homeless from this virus.\n\nIn 2018, Leila Farha, the UN Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing, visited San Francisco and was horrified by the conditions for the homeless. Noting how homeless people are denied basic access to water, toilets, and sanitation she said, [“The idea that a government would deny people those services …when they have nowhere else to go suggests a kind of cruelty that is unsurpassed.\"](https://www.businessinsider.com/un-expert-san-francisco-homeless-cruelty-2018-11) Last year, an investigation by the New York Times concluded that the conditions for the homeless in Oakland were [comparable to or worse than the conditions in the slums of Mexico City](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/17/us/oakland-california-homeless-camp.html). In normal times, the homeless in the U.S. live in extremely precarious conditions, and face constant evictions and harassment from the government.\n\nDuring this epidemic, the homeless will be particularly hard hit. Studies have found that with the exception of obesity, strokes, and cancer, [the homeless are far more likely to suffer from every category of chronic health problem.](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/Health.pdf) This includes diseases like diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, [which all increase the likelihood of dying from Coronavirus](https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2020/03/09/coronavirus-covid-asthma-diabetes-cancer/4962424002/). Given this situation, some minor improvements to sanitation like handwashing stations are unlikely to do much to deter the spread of Coronavirus among the homeless, especially given that recent studies have shown that [the virus has a significant ability to spread via airborne transmission](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay).\n\nWhat’s more, given the history of abuse and oppression heaped on the homeless, it is likely that during this crisis they will be treated as potential vectors for the virus that endanger the rest of the population. Instead of the government working to provide them with housing and medical care, the homeless could be rounded up and treated as a public safety risk. Historically, the U.S. government has left many poor people to die during disasters. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, [thousands of poor, most black residents of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward were left to fend for themselves](https://www.democracynow.org/2005/9/5/survivors_from_new_orleans_speak_out) while the government focused evacuation and relief efforts on wealthy communities. When the government finally did offer assistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) housed around [30,0000 people in the Superdome, a sports stadium without proper plumbing, food, or supplies](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/08/refuge-of-last-resort-five-days-inside-the-superdome-for-hurricane-katrina). During Hurricane Maria [thousands of people in Puerto Rico died](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/24/763958799/2-years-after-hurricane-maria-hit-puerto-rico-the-exact-death-toll-remains-unkno) in part due to government negligence.\n\nResidents in one of Oakland's largest encampments are well aware of this disturbing possibility. When asked how they felt about the situation, one resident of this encampment said, “they \\[local officials\\] have told us nothing, they could come and put us in FEMA camps.” This fear reflects the experiences of many homeless people, who already regularly have to deal with [violent assaults](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/violence-redefined-nyc-homeless-shelters-keeping-stats-article-1.3826801), [overcrowding](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/shelters-are-overcrowded-more-housing-needed-homeless-northwest-territories), and [poor health conditions](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/homeless-shelter-parents_b_1035952) in the existing shelter system. It’s not unreasonable to assume that during a crisis, they would be treated even worse by a system that already considers them disposable.\n\nIn the current crisis we can see the brutal way the state and national authorities treat people in general. A recent case where this came out was the management of a Coronavirus outbreak on the Grand Princess cruise liner. The cruise ship was off the coast of San Francisco, en-route from Mexico to the U.S., when it reported probable cases of Covid-19 onboard. [The boat was then in limbo for several days](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-diary-of-a-grand-princess-crew-member-as-covid-19-spread-on-the-ship), while president [Trump worried about whether letting the passengers debark from the ship would raise the U.S. number of Coronavirus cases and make him look bad](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-keep-passengers-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-2020-3?op=1). Eventually he agreed to let the passengers get off in Oakland, but at that point the virus had been spreading on the ship for days and days, certainly infecting more of the passengers and the crew.\n\nA[lmost 3000 people disembarked from the vessel over three days, and the US residents aboard were shuttled to nearby military bases to be quarantined](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/03/16/coronavirus-grand-princess-departs-oakland-lets-off-crew/5058788002/). People in this situation were given little information on how long they will be detained, and many reported [dwindling food in the days leading up to their disembarking the vessel](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cruise-ship-guests-food-grand-princess-claims).\n\nNegligent and authoritarian responses like this will only become more common as the situation intensifies. Furthermore, state and federal agencies are under more pressure to “do more.” Homeless people are some of the most vulnerable in our society. Both authoritarian crackdowns and a lack of action to protect the homeless will impact them even more. Given the response we have seen to Coronavirus so far, it seems likely that the state will mismanage this situation as well, putting many at risk through a mix of negligence and repressive measures.\n\n*For more of our updates, follow us on twitter (*[*https://twitter.com/revunitedfront*](https://twitter.com/revunitedfront)*) or check out our website:* [https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/)\n\n**About us: We're the Revolutionary United Front, a US-based revolutionary organization in the U.S. organizing in the Greater Boston, New York, and San Francisco areas.

The financial sector has already contributed to the compromised nature of our present economy because of a constantly increasing debt-to-product ratio. In other words, the amount of actual money being lent out in the global economy far exceeds the monetary value of actual goods and services, and this is particularly bad news in crisis situations.\n\nIf major agencies default on debt payments, the credit market could quickly freeze up.

It is possible authorities may manage to stave off such a crisis in the United States, as they just barely managed to do in 2008. But even in this optimistic scenario, it would be unreasonable to believe the fundamental problems underlying the crisis would be resolved.\n\nFurthermore, while the mess of our financial system in crisis will be difficult for authorities to untangle, Korowicz convincingly argues that production and supply-chain relations are *even mor*e complicated. The complex interrelation of goods and services required for creating the basic necessities of life, including food, transportation and other commodities, is nearly impossible to fully map-out. One example of this complexity is that on average 15,000 individual parts are necessary to produce a single car. The loss of even one critical component for producing such an item can lead to massive interruptions, as this would result in paused production on this and all other lines requiring that component, or which require components that incorporate that critical part.\n\nThis is already starting to occur, as large scale work interruptions around the globe are creating shortages of goods. In one case, Boeing’s 787 and 767 planes require parts from a manufacturer in northern Italy. General Electric, which supplies 90% of Boeing’s engines, also requires parts from Italy. Production of [a whole series of goods has ground to a halt in Italy](https://qz.com/1815731/italys-luxury-manufacturing-is-threatened-by-coronavirus/) while the country is on lockdown due to the Coronavirus. Coupled with Boeing’s ongoing safety and reliability problems, this has pushed [the company to the point of collapse.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/economy/boeing-coronavirus-economy.html)\n\nKorowicz convincingly argues that the highly interrelated nature of our global economy *makes it even more vulnerable to crises*. In Boeing’s case, had the company maintained its traditional vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy (i.e. primarily in-house, U.S. based production of its various components) that it abandoned in the early 2000s, it would now face less immediate fallout from the present loss of production capability in Italy. Interestingly, the company’s move towards aggressive outsourcing was not merely part of a larger global trend, but was [promoted by its partners in the U.S. military](https://www.csmonitor.com/1996/1216/121696.us.us.1.html) in the mid 1990s.\n\nFollowing the [hundreds of deaths resulting from the company’s 737 Max engineering disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/business/boeing-737-crashes.html), the company has tried to reverse its decades long shift away from vertical integration. However, [it has faced major obstacles in doing so](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-experts-suppliers-talk-of-pushing-up-jet-production-while-pushing-down-costs/).\n\nWhile limited shortages have already been reported for food and other supplies, breakdowns in supply chains have likely only just begun. Stores and agencies generally have a certain reserve capacity on hand for sudden interruptions in supply or for increases in demand. Right now many stores and other businesses are using such reserves to restock depleted supplies, *but this will not be tenable long-term*. It is essential to grasp the non-linear impact of a crisis. Operations will increasingly fail because of a lack of cash-flow or because of a lack of labor. Already many people laid off from jobs are worried about how they will buy food even with a mostly stable situation at supermarkets at present. Disconcertingly, if food supply chains start to crumble, Korowicz states that cities only have about a three day food supply on hand at a given moment, and that without serious pre-planning, *authorities will not be able to establish alternatives for weeks.*\n\nLikewise, the impact from serious disruptions caused by the last several days of U.S. work stoppages will have major implications in the weeks ahead. As Korowicz states, “Pandemic modeling has shown that removing at random only small numbers of a population can cause cascading failure of functions across an economy.” He states that these failures would soon threaten to disrupt the functioning of large infrastructure such as power plants. Such pieces of infrastructure require thousands of specific parts to operate, as well as specialized skills to carry out repairs, possessed by people who may well be unable to work now because of sickness or quarantine. The impact of disruptions are magnified when they occur in a major economic power such as the United States, which provides many irreplaceable skills and services to the global economy.\n\nSuch shockwaves are likely to increase in the near future, driven by an economic system made even more vulnerable by its reliance on debt. As Korowicz states “A contracting economy is incompatible with the credit backing the global economy.”\n\nIn one example of how the pandemic crisis is already cascading into a financial crisis, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Agency (MTA) yesterday requested [a federal bailout of $4 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-subway-federal-aid-.html). The MTA requested this nicely rounded figure based on a projected decrease of “$3.7 billion *from lost fares in the next few months*, should ridership trends continue” and for “coronavirus-specific expenses, like disinfecting subway cars and stations” estimated to reach $300 million.\n\nThese numbers do not add up.\n\nAccording to the MTA’s own numbers, the agency collects about [$741 million in total fares, tolls, and advertising per month](https://new.mta.info/document/12481), meaning that the $3.7 billion figure is closer to a situation in which the number of NYC commuters *was reduced to zero for a five-month period*. And this is without even factoring in operating savings that would accrue to the MTA given reduced bus and train schedules due to future interruptions.\n\nAs the *New York Post* pointed out, the MTA is hiding its obvious debt problem. One of the MTA’s biggest expenses is simply paying back interest on a debt which is [projected to rise to $52 billion in 2023](https://nypost.com/2020/03/11/subway-riders-might-pay-for-mtas-debt-with-fare-raises-cut-service/), up from $35 billion last year. Simply paying interest on its debt approaches the total annual amount the agency pays for labor. As a result, a relatively minor immediate loss of revenue can be disastrous to the agency, making it unable to make payments to its creditors. Put another way, the agency even in normal times is barely solvent, creating a scenario in which a ripple, such as present difficulties, threatens to quickly submerge it and its financial backers, putting them beyond a point of no-return.\n\n“The gist of it is that the risk of debt is just the same for the MTA as it is to a person,” said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, quoted in the Post’s article.“You can’t afford to have anything go wrong. You can’t lose your job. The MTA can’t have any setback of any kind or you won’t be able to pay off your debt.”\n\nAnd the same applies to the economy on a wider scale. It is extremely vulnerable to disruption.\n\nAs Korowicz [stated in a blog post earlier this month](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-03-04/we-need-to-talk-about-catastrophic-global-risk/), “The government will no-doubt do everything they can to support businesses and the banking system with credit and stimulus, adding yet more debt to an already overindebted system. That will constrain future economic growth, increase the likelihood of future financial crises, and make the country less resilient to the next shock, from whatever the source. It is also straining political legitimacy, adding further uncertainty.”\n\nIn other words, the government will attempt to continue to plug up the vast numbers of holes in what amounts to a doomed ship, rather than creating a solid foundation to address the present medical and economic catastrophe.\n\nTellingly, as part of an apparent organizational hope within the *New York Times* that large-moves by the state and federal government can resolve the present crisis, the paper yesterday did not see fit to include any reporting about the MTA’s debt burden in its coverage of the agency’s bailout plea.\n\nAs crises continue to flare related to the pandemic, it is important to comprehend the even greater perils that may soon emerge. From Trump, to state government, to liberal critics, it seems that these risks presently are simply not being taken into consideration.\n\n*For more of our updates, follow us on twitter (*[*https://twitter.com/revunitedfront*](https://twitter.com/revunitedfront)*) or check out our website:* [https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/)\n\n**About us: We're the Revolutionary United Front, a US-based revolutionary organization in the U.S. organizing in the Greater Boston, New York, and San Francisco areas.

It grants the military broad sweeping powers, and if imposed it would likely mean that people would be required to go through military checkpoints to move between states or even around cities. In the history of the United States, martial law on a national-level has only been declared once. This was done by [Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.](https://lawi.us/history-of-martial-law/) After the Civil War, this decision was declared unconstitutional in the Supreme Court case [*Ex parte Milligan*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/71/2).\n\nMartial law has also been imposed at a state-level numerous times, during the period of big political struggles such as [the Colorado Coalfield War](https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/coalwar.html), [the West Virginia Coal Wars](https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2018/09/buried-history-west-virginias-coal-wars/), and during [the Civil Rights Movement.](http://digital.archives.alabama.gov/cdm/ref/collection/voices/id/5382) In each of these instances, martial law was used as a pretext to crack down on people’s movements, to suppress dissent, and to prevent people from having a right to a trial by a jury of their peers. The U.S. government has been using the Coronavirus crisis to [roll back financial regulations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/coronavirus-economy-dodd-frank.html) and push for legislation which would [eliminate encrypted electronic communications](https://tech.newstatesman.com/security/earn-it-us-bill-end-encryption).\n\nAll of this raises real questions about the imposition of martial law. While it would be framed as a necessary step to fight the spread of the virus, we should be very wary of the government’s efforts to undermine our democratic rights during a crisis of this magnitude. The Trump administration’s initial response to the pandemic has been [widely criticized as being incompetent at containing the spread of Coronavirus](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/here-are-17-ways-the-trump-administration-bungled-its-coronavirus-response/).

He even went so far as to [call it a hoax.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/trump-says-the-coronavirus-is-the-democrats-new-hoax.html) In a matter of days the administration’s response has shifted. Now they are considering martial law and a total lock-down of the country. While some may consider this a necessary step to fight the spread of the virus, the administration’s pattern of blatant disregard for the health and well being of the people during this pandemic raises serious questions about the imposition of martial law. The government’s [inability to do something as simple as increase testing capacity](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-per-capita-chart-us-behind-2020-3?op=1) also raises questions about how effective martial law would be at slowing the spread of Coronavirus. This sort of lock-down would necessarily entail a massive curtailment of civil liberties, and it would also set a precedent, justifying future use of martial law during times of crisis.

Even the most brutal of slaveholders were therefore compelled to develop a sophisticated system of management that exploited the most human aspirations and fears of the people they dominated.  \n>  \n>Creating divisions between slaves was essential to this. Enslaved people outnumbered free whites in the British Caribbean. In Jamaica the ratio was higher than 10 to one, and on some big plantations it was about 100 to one. Managers therefore needed to divide slaves in order to rule over them. The slave trade from Africa provided them with one opportunity. As a manager of several large Jamaican sugar estates remarked in 1804, it was a general policy to ‘have the Negroes on an estate a mixture of nations so as to balance one set against  another, to be sure of having two-thirds join the whites’ (in the event of an uprising). The theory behind this was that enslaved people from one African ‘nation’ would refuse to join rebellions plotted by those  from others, or by creole (locally born) slaves, choosing instead to serve their white masters in the hope of rewards for loyal service.  \n>  \n>Privileging some enslaved people above others was another [effective](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144039X.2014.944032) means of sowing discord. Slaveholders encouraged complex social hierarchies on the plantations that amounted to something like a system of ‘class’. At the top of plantation slave communities in the sugar colonies of the Caribbean were skilled men, trained up at the behest of white managers to become sugar boilers, blacksmiths, carpenters, coopers, masons and drivers. Such men were, in general, materially  better-off than field slaves (most of whom were women), and they tended to live longer.  \n>  \n>The most important members of this enslaved elite were the drivers, responsible for enforcing discipline and work routines among the other enslaved workers. These men were essential to effective plantation management—a conduit for orders and, sometimes, for negotiations between white overseers and the massed ranks of field workers. They were also among the strongest [survivors](http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15720.html) of the system.  \n>  \n>The privileges conferred on the enslaved elite came in several [forms](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03071020500304627): better food, more food, better clothing, more clothing, better and bigger housing, even the prospect (in some rare cases) that a master might use his last will and testament to free them.  \n>  \n>…  \n>  \n>The various privileges extended to the enslaved elite helped to create a conservative attitude among some—keen to protect what they had gained. They also produced an aspirational culture, of sorts, within the slave community—a bleak and tragic shadow of the ‘American dream’ of independence and riches that motivated the slaveholders. Those slaves who lived long enough and were not physically or psychologically broken by plantation work could aim to join the ranks of the skilled, privileged plantation elite. …  \n>  \n>…  \n>  \n>And their stories remind us that they were all trapped. However complex and divided the slave community, however many people we find who were able carve out precarious positions of relative comfort, we find them struggling to live within a system designed to promote disunity, anxiety and fear. …\n\nI couldn’t help but notice how our socioeconomic and political systems resemble this:", "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "created_utc": 1587682914.0, "tickers": [["COO", 1]]}

However, Big Tech spent $75BN on R&D in *2018 alone*.\n\n**Part 3/5 - The Market:**\n\nChamath then gives his take on the market, stating that central banks have exhausted their ability to meaningfully manage inflation, in either direction, but that doesn't mean that stock prices won't continue to go higher via unnecessarily cutting rates and flooding markets with money.\n\n\"Our simple framework is this: as money gets cheaper, the credit markets continue to expand because CEOs become motivated to artificially boost Earnings Per Share. They do this by buying back stock, seek bad acquisitions, make poor capital allocation decisions or avoid taxes. All enabled by borrowing massive amounts of essentially free money. It shouldn’t surprise you to know that these decisions also result in ever increasing CEO pay.\"\n\nBasically, Earnings Per Share is net profit/number of outstanding shares - so when companies buyback their own shares the number of outstanding shares decreases and therefore the denominator decreases and therefore Earnings Per Share increases.\n\nNow because many CEOs have bonuses that are tied to hitting a certain Earnings Per Share, this leads to an obvious incentive for corporations to buyback their own stock.\n\nIt is little wonder that Corporations are the dominant source of equity demand.\n\nIn the words of Charlie Munger:\n\n\"Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.\"\n\n**Part 4/5 - VCs:**\n\n\"VCs are increasingly motivated by the incentives of up-rounds, bigger funds and fee-based compensation. The flood of fast money has created a surfeit {pronounced surf-it} of these overnight practitioners with questionable sources of capital and even more questionable backgrounds.\"\n\n\"Big Tech raised a total of $1.345BN in venture capital before going public of which $1.3BN was Facebook alone. This means that Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google raised less than $45MM *combined* before IPO. Even on an inflation adjusted basis, this is incredible and tells something very important about a raft of today's startups.\"\n\n**Part 5/5 - Performance:**\n\nIt's safe to say 2019 was a pretty good year for Social Capital.\n\nThe returns in 2019 lifted their inception to date performance by more than 350bps.\n\nSince inception in 2011, they have compounded their money 997%, beating the S&P 500 (with dividends reinvested) by more than 3 times.\n\nIn 2019, they generated more than $1.7BN in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nChamath states that liquidity will be increasingly important over the next few years.\n\n\"Selling, when appropriate, and generating cash in a thoughtful way seems to be a prudent decision for the next several years.\"\n\nIn 2019, they completed two transactions:\n\nThe first was an investment of more than $500MM into Virgin Galactic, thus creating the first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company.\n\nChamath is tight lipped about the second company, but describes it as \"an acquisition of a venture backed company that had raised almost $100MM of traditional VC money.\"\n\nIn the Letter, Chamath compares the first 8 years of Social Capital to the first 8 years of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nHowever, [even Chamath agreed that the Berkshire Hathaway comparison was slightly misleading](https://twitter.com/bornaVC/status/1237181119277088768) \\- as the ratio of Berkshire Hathaway performance to the S&P 500 was around double the ratio of Social Capital to the S&P 500 over their respective periods.\n\nNonetheless, still pretty good!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJN68wt4pk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJN68wt4pk)", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1587888271.0, "tickers": [["VC", 1]]}

Some of that adaption will require higher educational attainment, or spending more time on activities that require social and emotional skills, creativity, high-level cognitive capabilities and other skills relatively hard to automate.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3/4 - Security:**\n\nThe digital nature of 4th Industrial Revolution technologies makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks that can take a multitude of forms, from data theft ransomware to the overtaking of systems with potentially harmful large-scale consequences.\n\nOrganised cybercrime groups are joining forces with their likelihood of detection and prosecution pretty low - [it is estimated that only 3 in 1000 cyber incidents see an arrest](https://www.thirdway.org/report/to-catch-a-hacker-toward-a-comprehensive-strategy-to-identify-pursue-and-punish-malicious-cyber-actors).\n\nAs well as this, the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution also offer expanded capabilities for waging war, which are increasingly accessible to both state and non-state actors.\n\nOn the frontier of emerging military technologies are those that [interact directly with the human brain to augment or even control soldiers](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-wants-soldiers-to-control-machines-with-their-minds-2019-12?r=US&IR=T).\n\nEven these are not limited to government military programmes.\n\nAccording to James Giordano of Georgetown University Medical Center: \"It's not a question of if non state actors will use some form of neuroscientific techniques or technologies, but when, and which ones they'll use.\"\n\nThe brain...is the next battle space\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 4/4 - Community:**\n\nThe final piece to this discussion is the impact that this will have on individuals and communities.\n\nDigital media is increasingly becoming the primary driver of our individual and collective framing of society and community, connecting more people than ever before but also *isolating* individuals in a maze of dopamine and polarizing propaganda.\n\nControversial or anti-establishment views can be further undermined by states and other actors willing to use new technologies and platforms to restrict speech.\n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is the first where the tools of technology can become literally embedded within us and even purposefully change who we are at the level of our genetic makeup. \n\nIt is completely conceivable that forms of radical human improvement will be available within a generation, innovations that risk creating entirely new forms of inequality and class conflict.\n\nThese emerging technologies will change what it means...to be human.  \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8D-wXs1PvE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8D-wXs1PvE)", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1590783079.0, "tickers": [["AI", 1]]}

I could name many german chains, but I suppose that wouldn't do any good here. \n\nBut you DO have Lidl in the US, right ? It's one of the biggest discounter chains here in germany (cheap prices, streamlined range of products).\n\nOf course I do know that everything that gets sold in retail first needs to be bought by the retailer, mostly through contractually fixated contingents, based on what product it is and how much of that is usually sold and needed in the area the store is in.\n\nBut how exactly do the mechanics work here ? \n\nBecause there are literally thousands of manufacturers, and there are a multitude of steps in the supply chains, especially when it comes to foods and drinks. \n\nFor example, there are foods who are heavily processed already in a factory (like ready meals, mixture bags for cooking specific meals etc.)  which is a highly industrialized process, which can be done by the big major companies themselves (Nestle, Kraft etc.), but there also things like fresh meat and fish, cutlery, cheese, eggs, milk, bread, pasta, rice, fruit, vegetables, beer, wine, spirits, you name it ...\n\nSome is seeded and harvested by farmers, some animals are bred for slaughter by farmers, chickens and cows must be kept and maintained for eggs and milk, bread is baked by bakers, beer brewed in brewery's, wine from winery's, mineral springs for bottled waters and so on and so forth ...\n\nI simply cannot imagine that all big retail chains would have supply contracts directly with the producers / farmers. Because if they had, how many freaking contracts would they have to make ? \n\nAnd these are almost always very small familiy businesses. And there are tens of thousands of them throughout the US (or most other nations, for that matter).\n\nThere are big industrialized bakery's, slaughterhouses, beverage filling plants and brewery's etc., of course.\n\nBut some things can hardly be ever fully industrialized beause they have to ORIGIN somewhere. As I said : Seeds must be sown, crops be harvested, pigs and chickens be bred. \n\nAnd the meat industry with their big meat-processing plants  turns the live stock into what we buy and consume, but they sure as hell didn't breed that pig themselves, you know what I mean ? \n\nIt's a little simpler with hygiene products and detergents, cleaners and household items, I guess.\n\nIn Germany for example the market for these items is very consolidated. Whenever you buy any cleaner, detergent or hygiene product there is a very good chance that it's a brand of one of 6 companys.\n\nHenkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Colgate Palmolive and SC Johnson. Those 6 basically share 90% of the market in these categories, so I suppose it is rather easy for retailers to make direct contracts with them. Plus, these things are made in industrail / chemical plants, most of it is artificial and no small time farmers are involved with the production of these items.\n\nBut with food and drinks ... I just don't understand.\n\nBig retailers sell all these products all day, every day. They're all in the store, they're all paid for at checkout, every customer takes specifically what they need and want. Everything gets digitally accounted for I suppose, but HOW does the retailer know how much they have to pay any individual supplier ? How much does Unilever get ? How much the meat-processing plant from New Jersey ? And how much does bloody Harold Jenkins, the self-employed crop farmer from Idaho and his family get ? \n\nHow can they possibly know how much of his valued labour is in the fucking loaf of bread they just sold for 79 ct ? How can this ever be fairly calculated ? Who pays Harold anyway ? Who is he selling to ? \n\nAre the suppliers / manufacturers paid strictly upfront upon order / delivery and strictly by allocated contingent ? Are they paid estimated lump sums ? And WHO is paid anyway ? Any manufacturer individually ? Or does it all get collected with wholesale marketers who have bigger negotiating power ? And if so, wouldn't that severely fuck over the small farmers and family businesses ?\n\nAnd then, of course, there are also those goods who are branded by the chains themselves, but as I understand it, these are often the same products as their original counterparts (often even produced in the very same factory) just repacked and relabeled, as a way to justify a discounted price. The manufacturers basically sell their excess at a calculated loss here, as a means to be able to run their plants and factories at max capacity at all times.\n\nAnd how do wholsale marketers factor into all this in general ? I know they deliver their stock at a win margin to gas stations and restaurants and business owners can go shop there directly. But do retail chains also get at least part of their stock from wholesales ? If so, that would be one more (rather redundant ?) link in the supply chain, no ? \n\nIt is more clear with bigger things like cars, furniture and electronics (both household and entertainment), because there simply aren't THAT many manufacturers and links in the supply chain. For example, Sony builds a certain line of LED-TV's in one of their plants and sells a certain contingent to any electronic retailer (or Amazon), who then sell it to the end-customer at a win margin, including VAT.\n\nBut how it works for retailers of daily necessities with their thousands upon thousands suppliers ...

Only December, but it is still crap, crap crap, crap. It should be more.\"\n\nSo Xu stepped his game up - he came up with 20 trading strategies - \"signals\" in quantspeak - and tested each in numerous simulations.\n\nSeven proved profitable enough to adopted by fund and put to work in real markets.\n\nSo at the start of 2014, Xu was feeling confident about his second-year bonus.\n\n\"If I get 1.1 million this year, next year should be 3.3 million. Next year it will be 16 million, then 100 million.\"\n\nInstead, he was awarded a bonus of £400K and, although this was a huge amount for a young man from provincial China, it was far less than he was expecting - so he began planning his exit.\n\nIt was around this time that Xu began covertly accessing his colleagues' signals.\n\nAfter all, he would have a better chance of getting a good job elsewhere if he had ready-to-use signals to offer potential employers.\n\nHe landed two offers in Asia, but told his managers at G-Research nothing about his plans. \n\nOne evening, Xu cleared out his desk and placed a resignation letter on his manager's desk, and boarded a flight to Hong Kong. \n\nThe abruptness of Xu's departure raised immediate suspicions.\n\nThe next morning security personnel at G-Research reviewed video footage of his activities the night before, leading the company's attorneys to get an emergency court order.\n\n***To cut a long story short, G-Research then got the prestigious law firm Allen & Overy on the case, got a travel ban against Xu, who was reported to police in London, then arrested in Hong Kong in August 2014, extradited to the UK in December 2014, then sentenced in July 2015 to four years in prison.***\n\nBut that's not all: G-Research then used an ancient quirk of the British legal system called a private prosecution to find out who's seen the 55 stolen signals.\n\nThis allows the purported victim of a crime, if they are rich of course, to prosecute the perpetrator if the state fails to do so.\n\nAlthough G-Research were paying their bills, the lawyers spoke to the jury per the norms of private prosecutions, as representatives of the Crown - the British Government.\n\nIn January 2017, jurors founds Xu guilty of two of the five charged in the private prosecution, and the judge sentenced him to an additional 18 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***So the top hedge funds secure their IP like a military facility, have an informational advantage, have the world's best lawyers at their beck and call, have the Fed on their side if things go wrong, and normies think they can match this and be day traders?!***\n\nYes, of course people like [this dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbbsNsdwjLM) regularly beat the hedge funds and make a profit every day! \n\nThe vast majority of online courses are scams. \n\nDon't buy them. \n\n***Every dollar you save and invest is a soldier working for you.***\n\nDon't supply these scammers with ammunition to increase their ad spend and fleece more people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nIn conclusion, ***DON'T DAY TRADE!***\n\nThese hedge funds have intellectual capital and infrastructure you can only dream of.\n\nInvest, don't gamble.\n\nThese dopamine-inducing roulette tables scramble our brains' natural rhythm,\n\nDon't take on more risk than you can handle, and don't amble,\n\nHit that like button for the algorithm.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9JcFAadCVo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9JcFAadCVo)", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "created_utc": 1592906295.0, "tickers": [["G", 1], ["IP", 1]]}

The Warehouse-Lending Process shows the two stages of the warehouse-lending process. In the initial stage, shown on the left side, the mortgage borrower is approved for a mortgage from the nonbank originator, who funds the mortgage using a draw from a line of credit provided by a warehouse lender. Typically, the warehouse lender will only fund about 95 percent of the mortgage balance, so that the nonbank originator has some skin in the game for each loan. The collateral on the loan is the mortgage, and the nonbank in turn transfers the mortgage to the warehouse lender to collateralize the draw on its line of credit. **Since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, mortgage-collateralized warehouse lending has been eligible for accounting and legal treatment as repurchase agreements (repos).**\n\nNext, turn to page 16: **III.D.

{"name": "t3_hr86di", "title": "Coming Back Better than Before", "text": "&#x200B;\n\nThe Coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the countries that did not execute an aggressive and coordinated response. For the first time ever, the United States is one of those countries.\n\nOne major reason why the US has, by far, the most cases and deaths of any country is the clear lack of leadership at the national level. However, the pandemic has exposed many other systemic weaknesses in our country. The American political and economic structures that allowed us to be the world leader for the last century, appear to be working against us with this new killer disease.\n\nTo some extent, we have been the victims of our own success. The strength of business in the US allowed us to achieve a dominant economic position after World War II. This prosperity fueled an incredibly strong middle class along with enormous innovation and technological advancement.\n\nOver the decades, companies have been pushing for continuous growth at aggressive rates to keep their investors satisfied. Corporations have evolved techniques to maximize revenues and minimize costs. After all this time, that approach has created enormous inequality and stress on our society. Those weaknesses have been exploited by this pandemic, which has left tens of millions of Americans exposed.\n\nWith this vicious pandemic, we were forced to essentially pause our economy. Millions of jobs have been lost and people have suffered greatly – both medically and economically. Businesses are going bankrupt and our global trade system will be changed forever. \n\nOur challenge is to use this time to correct our underlying economic problems and come back in a way that benefits all Americans. Either we will make the economic inequality greater, or we can generate a rising tide that lifts all boats. The rich are poised to buy up bankrupt businesses and assets and build the next generation of winning corporations. After all the suffering and sacrifice, do the people of this country want to benefit from the eventual economic renaissance, or be sidelined forever as a cheap temporary labor base competing for whatever jobs can no longer be automated.\n\nWhen the next pandemic or other disaster hits, do you want to have economic security and medical coverage, or do you want to go through the type of stress and hardship that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing now. \n\nThe United States is still, by far, the richest country in the world. Let’s come back in a way that preserves our freedom and way of life, but allows for more than 10% of us to prosper. \n\nLet’s examine some of the economic issues we were facing before COVID-19, as they have been exacerbated since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Troubling facts before COVID-19**\n\n**Corporations over People**\n\n· Corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes – Individuals paid Income tax of $1,700B in 2019, while Corporations only paid 230B (only 11% of Fed tax revenue in 2019). That 2019 ratio calculates out to individuals paying 7.4X more than corporations. In the 1950’s, it was <2X.\n\n· Corporations had been using the majority of their profits to buy back their own stock or pay dividends to shareholders – increasing Executive compensation instead of improving the company, compensating employees, or saving for a “rainy day”.\n\n· Corporations use lobbying power and lax campaign financing rules to have an out-sized influence on our politicians, legislation, and policy.\n\n· Corporations can shop which states to locate in, extracting incentives and low state and local taxes at the expense of the communities they leave as well as relocate to.\n\n**Financial inequality**\n\n· Income inequality - Over half of American workers make less than $30,000 per year. 40M American families need “food stamps” to get by.\n\n· Wealth inequality - The median net worth was 65,000, and less than 15% of workers have a pension to fall back on – vs – 18.6 millionaires in the US (> 40% of global). Three people (Bezos, Gates, Buffet) have more net worth than the bottom half of Americans (160M people)\n\n· Billionaires and other Ultra High Net Worth Individuals control Political Action Committees (PAC’s) that influence elections and political behavior to the benefit of the top 1%\n\n**State inequality**\n\n· Small states have as much as 4x the per capita “voting power” for their residents than the largest states due to inequities in the electoral college system \n\n· All states have 2 US Senators, but California has 68x the population of Wyoming\n\n· NY, NJ, MA, CT, CA, and IL paid 319B more in Federal taxes than they received back in Federal spending (2015-18). VA, MD, KT, AL, FL and NC received 1,010B more from the Federal government than they paid in. (note: that the Fed government runs nearly a $1T budget deficit so overall the paybacks to states are 1.2x+ what they paid in\n\nThe pandemic has exacerbated these issues and viciously exposed the weaknesses and unfairness in our economic and social systems.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Troubling economic effects from COVID-19**\n\n**Corporations over People**\n\n· The majority of Federal bail-out money went to Corporations and businesses, and not to help individuals. \n\n· Many corporations that spent the vast majority of their profits on stock buy-backs while the economy was strong, received Federal funding despite their bad business judgement. They reaped the reward, but didn’t take responsibility for the risk they took. If it is capitalism, there should be consequences, such as bankruptcy, for corporations who make bad decisions.\n\n**Financial inequality**\n\n· The vast majority of “essential workers” make less than $11/hour with little to no benefits. They are asked to take the risk of disease for the rest of us with very little financial benefit, and inadequate safety equipment and testing. \\[Note: Minority populations are much more affected, but the subject of racial inequality is so huge and important that I will not attempt to go into that dimension here.\\]\n\n· Tens of millions of American workers are now unemployed, with very unknown prospects for getting back to work again. \n\n· With higher unemployment going forward, there will be downward pressure on wages for those who can keep their jobs.\n\n· The wealthiest people who have cash to invest will buy up valuable assets and profit from this economic collapse. \n\n**State inequality**\n\n· Weak Federal response to testing, tracing, and PPE not only created an environment where the United States has dramatically more COVID-19 cases and deaths than any other country in the world, but the State governments had to fend for themselves and pay inflated prices for whatever they could purchase.  In addition, unemployment and other benefits to individuals and families are paid by the State with little to minimal support from the Federal government.  With the concentration of cases in NY and NJ early on, those states had to absorb the most cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can we use this painful and terrible disruption to change things for the better? Here are some principles and objectives that the majority of Americans can get behind and demand get done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Put People over Corporations** \n\n· Tax reform for Corporations – eliminate tax loopholes and reform the corporate tax structure so the Federal government takes in at least 1 corporate tax dollar for every $2 dollars paid in individual income tax. (Some areas of select focus should be eliminating overseas tax shelters and strictly limiting carry forward losses.)\n\n· Eliminate stock buy backs – go back to the earlier rules where stock buy backs were not allowed and were treated as a form of insider trading. At a minimum, require all corporations to meet minimum pay and benefit requirements for their employees plus accumulate and hold enough cash to cover a year or two of operating costs before they can issue dividends or buy back any stock. \n\n· Eliminate tax breaks for stock options and awards. Strictly limit (or eliminate) the amount of executive pay that is tied solely to stock performance. \n\n· Campaign finance reform - Eliminate PAC’s and impose strict limits on donations plus maximum caps on election spending.\n\n· Lobbying reform – put strict limits on corporate lobbying as well as strong oversight and governance on politicians getting any financial benefits from lobbyists or the businesses they represent (including jobs after their terms)\n\n· Impose minimum corporate tax rates that all States must adhere to so companies can not drive down the state and local taxes they pay to rock bottom.\n\n· For future emergencies, ensure that individual citizens are protected as a first step. No one should go hungry, lose their apartment/house, or need to worry about medical coverage. Those basic individual needs come first – before any discussions about business subsidies, bail-outs, or economic stimulus spending.\n\n· When corporate bailouts are discussed, they must be in exchange for equity if the company has not saved enough cash to cover their costs for 1 year minimum. If the company paid dividends or did stock buy-backs, they would need to turn those shares over to the government before any government bailout money could be provided.  Bankruptcy will be more common when companies are not fiscally responsible, and the rights of workers will be protected above shareholders in bankruptcy settlements.\n\n· Institute a single payer Government run Health care system that covers all Americans - removing corporate profit that Private Health Insurance companies currently extract to reduce overall per capita costs. \n\n· Reform Oil and Mining policies and legislation. The taxpayers need to get a much larger stake in resources that are extracted from American soil. The US should consider nationalizing the Oil industry, or, at least, setting up a sovereign fund similar to what Norway has. All other mining businesses need to be similarly treated.\n\n· Basic utilities such as water and power should be nationalized. Utilities should be run for safety and efficiency and not a source of profit generation for corporations.\n\n**Reduce financial inequality**\n\n· All US citizens will get medical coverage as a basic right.\n\n· The minimum wage will be raised to $15/hour and adjusted for inflation going forward.\n\n· Estate Tax reform, including a requirement that all accrued investment capital gains are paid upon a person’s death before passing down as inheritance. \n\n· US corporations will bring manufacturing and outsourced jobs back to the US. This will be accomplished via tax penalties and incentives in additional to government oversight on the outsourcing of critical / essential / strategic industries. \n\n· The US government will shift domestic spending to programs and projects that increase jobs and improve people’s everyday lives. Focus will be on capital improvements and good paying jobs with benefits that bring value to our society.\n\n· The US government will also focus on future job creating technologies by increasing investment in Research and Development and protecting the Intellectual Property (IP) that is created – including giving the government a financial stake in future profits for projects that have been invested in, as well as not allowing other countries to gain the IP without adequate financial compensation. Focus on innovation, which has traditionally been a powerful differentiator for the United States but is now languishing. Recognize that social media and similar technologies that focus on diverting attention to drive ad revenue are not actually advancing our society.\n\n· Campaign finance reform. Eliminate PAC’s. Cap individual donations. Limit total spending allowed for campaigns. Elections should not have to be a multi-billion dollar media circus.\n\n· For future emergencies, policies need to be in place to call out what jobs are considered essential and then pay those people a bonus in line with the risk they are being asked to take for the public benefit. This should be one small part of a pandemic plan that is well documented and ready to be executed instantly and without partisan bickering.\n\n· As part of pandemic planning, the Federal government will need to be responsible for subsidizing the state unemployment pools to cover the increased costs due to government action.\n\n**Fairness across the States of our Nation**\n\n· The electoral college system must be eliminated. The US needs to enforce 1 person 1 vote.\n\n· The role of the Senate needs to be reformed, with less power due to the inherent inequality of a system that gives low population States so much more per capita voting power.\n\n· Every state should get back no more/less than 10% +/- back in Federal spending than they paid in through the Federal income tax of their residents. Any deficit spending by the Federal Government must also be allocated back to the states in proportion to the federal taxes paid by the people in that state.\n\n· A pandemic plan (and other emergency plans) must be in place with funding to keep it current, actionable, and best of breed. Politics should be removed with quantifiable, fact-based rationale for when and where money is spent. State governments need to be compensated for their excess costs and individuals must be protected above businesses.

{"name": "t3_hvv7bp", "title": "The Federal Reserve", "text": "The Federal Reserve. The Fed.\n\nA source of numerous memes.\n\nA topic that has recently reached the critical mass of mainstream consciousness.\n\nA question that always lingers in the air is...who controls the Fed?\n\nBefore we can answer that deep question we need some context: what does the Fed do?\n\nOfficially...and unofficially.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOfficially, the Fed has four main responsibilities:\n\n1. Conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices.\n2. Supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers.\n3. Maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets.\n4. Providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, U.S. financial institutions, and foreign official institutions, and playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payments systems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”***\n\nThose are the words of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.\n\nUnofficially, the Fed enriches the top 0.1% in a process known as the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), which basically states that money printing itself increases inequality via asset price inflation.\n\n***Moreover, we currently have a situation whereby corporations run by executives with HUGE stock packages borrow money from Fed-fed banks for roughly free, buy back stock - thus boosting its price, then sell their own shares, using the proceeds to \"diversify\" into other assets (namely other stocks), expecting the Fed to keep the asset-inflation scheme going indefinitely.***\n\nThe recent spate of bailouts has highlighted the severity of the situation.\n\nThe Fed's policy of subsidising interest rates has incentivised corporations to borrow cheap money and buy back shares instead of saving cash for a rainy day.\n\nThe executives pocketing multi million dollar bonuses via this financial engineering should be chastised, but ultimately it is the Fed that facilitates this - just like it was the Fed who incentivised greedy bankers leading up to the '08 mortgage crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo understand who controls the Fed, we must go back to the Fed's formative years.\n\nThe year is 1910.\n\nThe month is December.\n\nSenator Nelson Aldrich was a prominent American politician and a leader of the Republican Party in the United States Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1911.\n\nAs an aside, his daughter Abby actually married John D. Rockefeller Jr, son of the famous John D. Rockefeller.\n\nAldrich and six other men were about to embark on a journey to Jekyll Island, an island off the coast of Georgia, where there was an exclusive resort which counted the Morgans, the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts as members. \n\nThese six men were:\n\nPaul Warburg (a partner at the investment bank Kuhn, Loeb, and Co.);\n\nFrank Vanderlip (president of National City Bank - now known as Citibank - and a former Treasury official);\n\nBenjamin Strong (vice president of the Bankers Trust Company and the future founding chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York);\n\nHenry Davison (a partner at J.P. Morgan);\n\nCharles Norton (President of J.P. Morgan's First National Bank of New York);\n\nand A.P. Andrew, who coincidentally was an economics professor at Harvard where he taught FDR, who would later sign Executive Order 6102 (otherwise known as the Great Gold Robbery of 1933).\n\nAldrich chose the attendees for their expertise, but he knew their ties to Wall Street could arouse suspicion about their motives and threaten the bill’s political passage.\n\nSo he went to great lengths to keep the meeting secret, adopting the ruse of a duck hunting trip and instructing the men to come one at a time to a train terminal in New Jersey, where they could board his private train car.\n\nOnce aboard, the men used only first names to prevent the staff from learning their identities.\n\nFor decades after, the group referred to themselves as the “First Name Club.”\n\nA member of the exclusive Jekyll Island Club, most likely J.P. Morgan himself, arranged for the group to use the club’s facilities.\n\nMunsey’s Magazine described this exclusive club as “the richest, the most exclusive, the most inaccessible” club in the world.\n\nAccording to Frank Vanderlip:\n\n***“I was secretive, indeed, as furtive as any conspirator. I do not feel it is an exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.***\n\n***Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.”***\n\nThe bankers initially drafted the Federal Reserve as the “Aldrich Bill,” but when it came to Congress, they recognized Senator Aldrich’s name, became suspicious, and decided against passing the bill.\n\nTo make it sound more official, they decided to re-brand the bill as “The Federal Reserve Bill.” \n\nThree years after their historic meeting at Jekyll Island, The Federal Reserve Act was singed into law on December 23rd 1913, and with that a small group of bankers had the monopoly over creation of American money.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act was originally granted a twenty-year charter to the Federal Reserve Banks, however on February 25th, 1927, it was extended indefinitely.\n\nThis proved crucial, as the sentiment in 1933 (nearing the end of the original 20 year charter) was not exactly positive with regards to the Fed.\n\nNow the good thing is that, since then, the Fed have been held to account by [rigorous audits and comprehensive investigative procedures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqM2tFOxLQ)...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn June 4th, 1963, US President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110, authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates.\n\nThis was the first of a series of moves to take control of US money back from the Federal Reserve by giving greater power to the Treasury.\n\nOn November 22nd, 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1861 was the beginning of the Civil War.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was short of money to finance the North's war effort and went to the bankers of New York, who agreed to lend him money at interest rates varying from 24 to 36 percent.\n\nLincoln refused, but he still needed to solve his money problem.\n\nColonel Dick Taylor came to the rescue and put the solution to him:\n\n***“Just get Congress to pass a bill authorising the printing of full legal tender treasury notes, and pay your soldiers with them, and go ahead and win your war with them also.”***\n\nThis is what Lincoln did: and on February 25, 1862, Congress passed the first Legal Tender Act, which authorized the issuance of $150 million greenbacks.\n\n(These Treasury notes were called “Greenbacks” by the people because they were printed with green ink on the back.)\n\n***Lincoln called these Greenbacks “the greatest blessing the American people have ever had.”***\n\nA blessing for all, except the bankers, since it was putting an end to their racket (i.e. the stealing of the nation's credit and issuing interest-bearing money).\n\nSo they did everything possible to destroy these Greenbacks and sabotage Lincoln's work.\n\nLincoln said:\n\n***“I have two great enemies, the Southern army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. And of the two, the bankers are my greatest foe.”***\n\nLincoln was re-elected President in 1864, and he made it quite clear that he would attack the power of the bankers once the civil war was over. The civil war ended on April 9, 1865...\n\nLincoln was assassinated six days later, on April 15.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe central bank in each country is the legal entity that manages the nation’s money supply and can lend money, with interest of course, to the government and other private banks in the country. This is how it all works:\n\n1. When the government needs more money, they ask the treasury department for money by issuing an IOU or government bond, which is a bond issued by the national government with a promise to pay periodic interest payments and to repay the face value on the maturity date.\n2. The Treasury (an executive department of government) receives the bond from the government and forwards it to the nation’s Central Bank.\n3. The Central Bank (a privately owned bank and the entity that owns the monetary system of the nation) then writes a check to the commercial banks in the country for the value of the bond and authorises them to create this new money. This central bank, of course, just invents money out of thin air.\n\nFor more clarity, we can refer to \"Putting it Simply\", released in 1984 by the Public Services Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\n\n***“When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our accounts to cover the check. But when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money”***\n\n4. The commercial banks then type numbers on a screen and create money out of nothing. At this exchange at the private banks, money is *officially* created and can be used to pay government bills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother part of this money creation system happens at the commercial banks.\n\n***Every time you take out a loan, banks simply type in some numbers digitally in your account and charge you interest on it. So basically, each time the bank makes a loan, the bank doesn’t use other people’s deposited money to loan to you. It creates new money by typing digits into a computer.***\n\n***97% of all money is generated that way. Only 3% is the physical paper cash and coins that we carry.***\n\nMoreover, commercial banks lend out up to 10 times more money than they actually have in reserves; a practice known as fractional reserve lending.\n\nTo demonstrate how absurdly the system is currently leveraged, that [reserve requirement has recently been cut to zero.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm) Yes, zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo who controls the Fed?\n\nWell, an international Cartel of Central Bankers, more ruthless and more intelligent than Escobar or El Chapo ever were.\n\nA Cartel who have effectively perfected a form of modern slavery; with debt taking the place of chains...and Central Bankers playing the role of Masters.\n\nI close with a quote from Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's father:\n\n***\"Even if it were desirable, America is not strong enough to police the world by military force. If that attempt is made, the blessings of liberty will be replaced by coercion and tyranny at home.\"***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9wgvTos04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9wgvTos04)", "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "created_utc": 1595429722.0, "tickers": [["HUGE", 1]]}

He persuades his friends Alice and Bob to buy works by an up and coming young artist, for $2 million each, on the understanding that they will be a good investment.\n\n***Step 2:*** Over the next few years, John Doe uses his position to hype the artist. He hires people to write about the artist in academic journals, organises exhibitions, helps the artist to 'win' prizes, etc.\n\n***Step 3:*** John Doe puts some of the artist's works into auctions, and bids the prices up with the help of friends. As he is ultimately buying from himself, the only cost is the auctioneer's commission.\n\n***Step 4:*** Ten years later, Alice and Bob own works that are worth, on paper at least, $10 million.\n\n***Step 5:*** In the meantime, Alice has just pulled off the real estate deal of a lifetime, and made a huge profit. Unfortunately, she now owes the IRS $10 million.\n\n***Step 6:*** She decides to donate the painting to her local modern art museum. The trustees are happy to state it's value at $10 million. The IRS accepts the valuation and allows Alice to write of her $10 million tax bill. She is now a noted philanthropist, and she gets a wing of the museum named after her.\n\n***Step 7:*** Bob, on the other hand, isn't doing so well. He needs cash quick, but he can't sell his painting on the open market - because it isn't worth very much without John Doe manipulating the price.\n\n***Step 8:*** Bob goes to his bank and asks for a loan, using the painting as collateral. However, the bank wants an independent assessment of its value, so they ask a world expert on this particular artist - John Doe. John Doe confirms that, based on previous auction prices, it's worth $10 million.\n\n***Step 9:*** The bank agrees to lend Bob 70% of the value - $7 million.\n\n***Step 10:*** So Alice has saved herself $10 million in taxes from an initial outlay of $2 million.

Almost the entirety of this fulcrum, from 3-months out to 30-years, is below 1%. How much further can this trend go? Long-term we’re headed for total yield suppression with full-on Japan-style yield curve control. But it’s not going to be a straight trend from here to there and we’re likely headed for a bump pretty soon…\n\n2-Falling yields (bonds up, yields down) have driven the stock/bond ratio to multi-decade lows. Its z-score (red circles) is at levels that have marked major reversals in stock/bond relative performance in the past. Stocks and bonds compete for capitam flows. A rotation out of safety and into risk might soon be underway.                                                                                                                                                         \n\n3- The bears who’ve been sitting on the sidelines of the equity rally off the March lows don’t understand the financial concept of relativity. Asset allocation is a choice of comparisons that contain a number of critical feedback loops. The rate of change in US Baa yields recently fell to its lowest level since 2003. These levels are more consistent with a major bottom in stocks, not a top.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hb8jrfyuuxi51.jpg?width=1234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fdc71f8f5fafdf69e2bceaca699ddfc9fe37ca9\n\n4- But as I’ve been pointing out the last few weeks, it appears there’s a major trend change brewing. The MOVE index (a measure of bond volatility) is at all-time lows. Compression regimes lead to expansionary ones. And there are some growing signs of important divergence. Here’s a chart showing 10yr Breakevens pulling away from UST 10yr yields.

Growth and inflation expectations… Or rather, things not turning out as bad as most were expecting them to. \n\n6- Veteran market technician [Martin Pring tweeted](https://twitter.com/martin_pring/status/1291760157098225664) this chart and wrote: “The long-term momentum for ISM New Orders has turned up.

Retail sales in both the US and EA are already close to or above their Jan-20 peaks; global manufacturing and services PMIs moved back into the expansionary territory in July and electricity consumption is now growing on a YoY basis in EMs ex-China like India and Brazil, which were lagging earlier.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3571cjxovxi51.jpg?width=1139&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5e9cac567f6c01137b8cb57f076eed7034aa598\n\n8- While Global New-Orders-to-Inventory-Ratio is pointing to a return to growth in global trade. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lou11sjvvxi51.jpg?width=578&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83ae009d0de0446b590fd14851786bfca824ae43\n\n \n\n9-We have fiscal to thank for this.

{"name": "t3_ifg526", "title": "Why Must Money Inflate Or Deflate In Value When There Is More Or Less Of It In Total?", "text": "TL;DR Why does fictional money fluctuate in value, despite seemingly not having a need to.\n\nWhy does the value of currency fluctuate in the modern era? In the United States, a 100 dollar benjamin is worth exactly 100$. We all collectively agreed that this cloth bill is worth that much and can be exchanged for goods or services up to 100$. So if we say its worth 100$ why does inflation or deflation affect its true value? In the past when the currency was backed by a resource, usually gold, the available money supply, as a result, was much smaller and less fluid.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo when the next economic crash occurred and everyone came screaming to the banks demanding all of their money back, the banks simply didn't have enough gold to give to everyone due to fractional reserve banking, as a result, millions of people lost their fortunes and sent the economy plummeting downward into a recession.\n\nIn modern times, however, the VAST majority of wealth lies digitally on computer servers and the overwhelming majority of transactions also occur digitally via debit cards or credit cards.  Now a debit card has a few distinct advantages over gold, it's significantly easier to transport, it's very difficult to steal the wealth it possesses and almost universally your wealth is backed by the full force and faith of the United States.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo let's say another economic crash happens due to say oh I don't know the world's most lethal pandemic in almost a century. What happens when people rush to the banks demanding the value their plastic cards hold? Well one of 2 things really, either they A request the central bank to print them more money to give to said distraught customers to make them feel better or B tell the customers that their money isn't able to be handed over because it's just digits in a computer system but is still able to be spent as normal.\n\nDoes this cause the same issue to the economy the first bank rush caused when there wasn't enough gold to go around? I don't believe so, as far as I can understand it we as society trade our time and our labor in exchange for a unit of value, we then trade this unit of value for the goods or services produced by other people who are trying to acquire said unit of value so they themselves can perpetuate the cycle. In this type of system, people are able to specialize into different career paths that provide a far greater collective value to everyone involved in perpetuating the system than if everyone was forced to work as a burger flipper at burger king for example.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo if deflation (reduction in total number) of a currency can't directly increase the value of a set unit of value due to universal availability. Then all, that's left to deal with is the possibility that too many people acquire such a significant amount of said unit of value that they cease to participate in the cycle of value exchange. Or in other words, because they already have so much money they don't need to produce any goods or service in order to survive, so they cease to do so.\n\nThis, however, seems like a rather trivial problem to overcome, a simple wealth % scaling based tax combined with a unit of value ceiling would entirely eliminate this possibility from happening. Put simply tax those that hold large sums of wealth proportionate to the amount they hold/make and put a maximum limit to the wealth that can be accumulated by one individual. This would ensure that ALL members of society would need to CONTINUE to contribute to the larger economy moving forward while also having the benefit of new tax revenues available for the funding of more robust public services.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAt the end of the day perhaps,I am missing something critical in my analysis of wealth and value within a society but as it stands based off my current understanding I see no good reason a fictional currency we designated the value of should change simply due to its availability, beyond archaic systems of power perpetuation.

Why my money is on Walmart", "text": "**Walmart Due Dilligence**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n\\- Partnership with Instacart\n\nRecently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \\[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart’s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.\n\n\\- Partnership with Shopify\n\nIn addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item’s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart’s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart’s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.\n\n\\- Partnership with ThredUp\n\nWalmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable’s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would’ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.\n\n\\- Google\n\nWalmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.\n\n\\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)\n\nWalmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.\n\nSince the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\n\\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel\n\nLet’s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO’s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.\n\n\\- Jet.com\n\nThe first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce.\n\n\\- Flipkart\n\nEver heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart’s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.\n\n\\- TikTok acquisition\n\nSome very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok’s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart’s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.\n\n**Walmart PLUS**\n\nWord is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year\n\n**2 Hour Delivery**\n\nWalmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.\n\n**5000+ US stores.**\n\nThis is Walmart’s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.\n\n**Some other interesting facts to consider.**\n\n\\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.\n\n\\- Walmart’s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%\n\n\\- Walmart’s expansion in Africa, India, China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nLet me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.\n\nWalmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on

{"name": "t3_j4dw87", "title": "The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation", "text": "**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**\n\nFirst off, let's set the scene.\n\nThe stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.\n\nEconomic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.\n\nThe correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.\n\nIn doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.\n\nHowever, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:\n\n*“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.\"*\n\nThe reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.\n\nNow, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.\n\n*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.\n\nWe are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.\n\nIn fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nInflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.\n\nDeflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.\n\nThat's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.\n\nWell, no.\n\nIf you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.\n\nAs the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. \n\nThis is why central banks fear deflation so much.\n\nHowever, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...\n\n**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**\n\nThe increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.\n\n[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.\n\nAll technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create \"supply side shocks\", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. \n\nIn the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.\n\nIt is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI\n\nAccording to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:\n\n*\"This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology\"*\n\nMoreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.\n\nOld legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. \n\nAs an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!\n\n**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**\n\nThe question is: how does this play out?\n\nIn the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.\n\nIn reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...\n\nOne could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:\n\n1. Divide and Conquer and\n2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)\n\nAs we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...\n\nSpeaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information. \n\nInformation feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.\n\nA fantastic example of this process is what has happened with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.\n\nIt's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).\n\nIt is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.\n\nTherefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.\n\nThe real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...\n\n**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**\n\nThe depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future.\n\nNow this will not necessarily happen straight away.\n\nHowever, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism is inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.\n\nFrom a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.\n\nEssentially, this means that the value of the network increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.\n\nAn asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.\n\n[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.\n\nOnly time will tell...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE)", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1601722777.0, "tickers": [["FREE", 1], ["AI", 1]]}

TLDR at bottom!\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWith the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. \n\n**Finding our compatible companies.** \n\nI only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) \n\n1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)\n\n2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). \n\n3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). \n\n4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). \n\n5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)\n\n**Understanding the HVAC market.**\n\nBefore we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.\n\nSome facts: \n\n1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. \n\n2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. \n\n3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).\n\n4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.\n\n5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).\n\n6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.\n\nAs can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.\n\n\\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.\n\n\\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.\n\n\\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.\n\n\\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.\n\n\\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.\n\n\\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.\n\n**Market share.**\n\nThis was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:\n\n\\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.\n\n\\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.\n\n\\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.\n\n\\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.\n\n\\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%\n\nMy conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox.

Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.\n\nLooking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:\n\n\\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.\n\n\\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.\n\n\\- Daikin spends the most on R&D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.\n\n\\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.\n\n\\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.\n\n\\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise\n\n\\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.\n\n\\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. \n\n\\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio\n\n\\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.\n\n\\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M\n\nNow on to the less financial aspect of the data.\n\nI really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.\n\nTo conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "created_utc": 1603657670.0, "tickers": [["AC", 8], ["TTM", 1]]}

{"name": "t3_kir1hm", "title": "After destroying its economy, Erdogan is indebting Turkey", "text": "  \n\nIn the last two and a half years, Turkey's economic situation has deteriorated sharply, and just when it was struggling to get back on track, after the recession following the currency crisis of the summer of 2018, the pandemic emergency, and the foreign military campaigns stopped its recovery. In the second quarter of 2020, in the months of the main production activities and international connections closure, the Turkish GDP contracted by 11% compared to the previous quarter, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a contraction in growth of 5% at the end of 2020.\n\nTo avoid the political and financial collapse, Erdogan took out a loan from the World Bank. That shows the inability of Erdogan and Turkey to secure even a very small amount. According to the World Bank, $300 million Rapid Support for Micro and Small Enterprises Project for Turkey, implemented by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization of Turkey (KOSGEB), will help people and firms by providing reimbursable support financing for manufacturing firms and other, innovative young firms focusing on manufacturing, scientific research and development, and computer programming. If Ankara presents Turkey as an industrial and rich country that lends Somalia and other nations, in reality, it appears to be unable to secure this amount.\n\nIt is clear that the policy adopted by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in recent years, namely that of stimulating growth through broad access to credit favored by low rates, has not only not worked but has been counterproductive. The unsuccessful attempt to support the lira over the past two years has cost Turkey 140 billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Also, for this reason, the management of former Finance Minister Beret Albayrak, who resigned after Erdogan replaced the governor of the Central Bank, become the target of criticism, not only from the opposition but also from within the ruling party. Among the most critical within the AKP, it seems that there was precisely Ağbal, his predecessor in the economy.\n\nErdogan is aware that the deterioration of the economy could cost dearly the political stability of his party. However, today the AKP, also due to the negative economic performance, is suffering from a decline in consensus and is suffering from internal divisions and several spills, such as that of former Finance Minister Ali Babacan, who last March founded the Democracy and Progress Party (Deva), and Ahmet Davutoglu, a former prime minister.\n\n“The WB financing provided under the project will go to Micro and Small Enterprises in Turkey, which are the main source of employment for poor and near-poor households and account for more than 40 percent of employment in the manufacturing sector,” remarked Stefka Slavova, Lead Economist at the World Bank and co-Task Team leader of the project. But it will be impossible for Turkey to repay this debt in the short to medium term.\n\nIf international investors have seen the appointment of the new Governor of the Turkish Central Bank as a signal of a change of direction and a return to a more conventional monetary policy, and more independent of President Erdogan's bankruptcy line, it is probably just a measure that doesn’t go beyond the short-term objective of stabilizing exchange rates. As long as Erdogan remains at the helm of Turkey, his interests and the Muslim Brotherhood's expansionist ambitions in the region will continue to weigh on the state economy, effectively making it impossible to return even 50% of the amount provided by the World Bank.\n\nOne month after his appointment, the new governor of the Turkish central bank Naci Agbal has implemented a significant increase in the interest rate from 10.25% to 15%. A move that reverses the low-interest rate policy pursued by the monetary institution over the past year and a half to stimulate growth - as requested by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - but which nevertheless did nothing but accelerate the devaluation of the Turkish lira and increase inflation, which has reached almost 12%. In the immediate future, the central bank's decision resulted in an appreciation of 3% of the national currency, which from January to early November lost 30% of its value against the dollar.\n\n[http://surl.li/ijuz](http://surl.li/ijuz)", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "created_utc": 1608720934.0, "tickers": [["WB", 1]]}

As Bill Ackman said: Give Every Child $6,750 So They Retire As Millionaires.\n\n2) Improve financial literacy and help eliminate the debt crises brought on by education, healthcare or housing. Eliminate student debt, but don't give colleges a handout. Give it to the people. \n\n3) Tax the rich or put in regulations that ensure companies distribute wealth differently. Jeff Bezos net worth rose 62% to $186 billion while tens of millions are suffering and amazon warehouse workers barely make a living wage. \n\nother ideas?", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "created_utc": 1609186160.0, "tickers": [["AN", 1]]}
