When it comes to residential (especially suburban/exurban) one big component is often the price of the underlying lot.  When demand is high that component often gains a huge windfall premium for developers; when demand is low, developers can often only (barely) recoup their costs (and can only make a minimal profit on the house itself).

And relative to custom built homes, my understanding (from talking to a few builder friends last fall) is that certain material costs have dramatically increased (especially things like copper: pipes & wires ... so cheaper options {PEX} are often substituted in, and these tend to also have savings in labor costs) -- while ironically other materials (say granite/marble countertops) have gotten a bit cheaper because a significant material supply (a long-chain ""glut"" thing) still exists while the demand is significantly down (not to mention that a host of alternatives were developed and starting coming online just as the housing bubble burst).",2,1392391157,[],,,

At the very low interest rates available to stable governments they can borrow for less than their targeted inflation rate and essentially borrow for profit as the debt inflates away.  The size of the debt can grow indefinitely without becoming a bigger percentage of GDP because of inflation, and therefore never becomes a problem.

Where it can become a problem is if people lose confidence for some reason or another and as debt comes due it needs to be reissued at higher interest rates.  Whatever caused the confidence shake in the first place will be some sort of event (be it a financial crisis or a war or simply issuing too much debt and looking fiscally irresposible) that also requires funding and suddenly you find yourself in a situation where you are issuing debt that you can't service without really turning the inflation up.  At least you have that option available if you control your own currency.  Greece, for example, can't.

Unlike most of the world SA has bought into the idea of PEAK OIL CONSUMPTION. This meaning that at some point in the future the world will no longer consume as much oil daily as was previously consumed. There is debate on when this date will actually come, but if this holds true, which seems likely, the price of oil will never really recuperate, much like coal. So the idea for SA is to maintain as much market share in any price environment as long as the world has not reached the peak consumption, as the saudi's know that their production is the most cheaply produced in the world.

t3_5mskpl,dc6n8cx,"As a former ""Debt Hawk"" myself (I occasionally run an econ blog) what I can say is that this problem is not confined to the US, and a lot of it has come about because of lower tax levels introduced in the early 1980s. 

One of the important things about high levels of government debt is that the government *must* pay interest on the money it has borrowed, and then pay back the principal onces the bond finishes.

Of course one way to deal with this problem is to borrow money from the market to pay back what you owe. But that isn't actually a solution since all you're doing is making the problem worse.

What concerns me the most about high levels of government debt is that, as debt increases, so too does the amount of money needed to pay off that debt. This means that government spending is increasingly directed towards debt servicing. This is money that could be spent on education, health care, infrastructure, and so on.

Japan has been borrowing money for decades. Its current debt/GDP is around 300% IIRC. But the price of servicing this debt is low because interest rates are so low. The interest rates in the US are also low enough for it to be less of a problem.

[This graph](http://i.imgur.com/IGPEMgt.png) is from one of the data spreadsheets I have, and shows how much debt servicing the US government has paid since 1951, as a percentage of GDP. 

As you can see, Reagan and Laffer put America in the lurch in the late 1980s with deficit spending. Clinton and the Republican congress worked together (!) to create a budget surplus which, together with an expanding economy, brought things under control during the 1990s.

The graph also shows that deficit spending during the Vietnam War also increased debt repayments - and these repayments were greater than the inflation which eroded debt in the 1970s.

----------

My solution is simple: raise taxes. Raising taxes will increase tax revenue, and the government will have more money to cover costs. Raise taxes far enough and you end up with a revenue surplus, which can be used to buy back the principal and reduce debt levels even further.

I believe that balance is an important axiom in economics. A national government's debts should remain net zero over the long term. This allows for periods of debt increase, but also periods of debt reduction. The business cycle is the driver of this phenomenon. So, in theory, a national government should go into deficit during bad times and go into surplus in the good times, with a zero net balance overall.

I do believe large debt levels hinder an economy's ability to perform at a reasonable level. The government bond market is huge, and people are making money simply by lending to the government so it can run its daily activities rather than lending to businesses so they can invest in capital. There is a level of ""crowding out"" that occurs.

Thus we can assume *all* goods and services provided change hands.

Or in other words, aggregate supply = aggregate demand.

In a basic model, you have three input factors, land, capital and labor. Land meaning not just land but natural resources, capital meaning non-perishable input factors, or things that don't ""go away"" when you use them, computers for example, or buildings, or machines.

The reason we generate ""value"" is that we combine those things to create something that's worth more. A pencil is more useful than a stick, a knife more useful than a piece of iron.

So let's say you have a very simple economy with two people, one person can make 10 fish a day, the other one can make 10 firewood a day. What's the output of the economy? Well, 10 fish and 10 firewood. What can they consume? 10 fish and 10 firewood. How that's distributed is a different question, maybe the one person is super cold all the time and will want to consume 7 firewood, maybe the other likes fish a lot, so they trade and one person ends up with 7 fish and 7 firewood and the other with 3 fish and 3 firewood. But that's not the question at hand, it's about total output/consumption, and this is basically how it works.

Where does money come in? Well, money is just a tool to make our lives easier. ""Just"", well of course an incredibly useful one, but not something that is strictly *necessary*.

So what's that money worth? The answer is 10 fish and 10 firewood. Because that's all you can buy. Why would money be worth more than what it can buy? This is called the [neutrality of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_of_money). It just *represents value*. Where that value *actually comes from* is the entire output of the economy.

That's also why it's basically irrelevant how much money there is, at least in the long run. The value of all money is just the value of all the output, it doesn't matter if there's 1000$ or 1$ for all of those 10 fish and firewood, it just means the numbers look different. This is also where inflation comes from. If the growth of the money supply is greater than the growth of the output, you get inflation.

Or in other words, a larger amount of money is chasing a smaller amount of goods, thus each unit of money is worth less.

Of course in the real world this is more complex, because you for example have the ability to shift consumption into the present/future. Creating lots of money and in turn lots of inflation would destroy savings, at least in the short term, and that would obviously be bad, for example.",2,1576506359,[],,,

I think an obvious trend that is already forming but will grow exponentially is moving in with family and living in multigenerational households. Moving in with someone who owns capital can allow all money coming in to be diverted to food and other goods that can be shared amongst the household as one or many members search for work or work precarious jobs. 

A more extreme example is a country like Brazil where an entire second economy developed in the form of favelas. Precarious housing set up by the people with their own systems for electricity, policing, and self-sufficient economy. It would essentially be like a mutation of the CHAZ or CHOP that is happening in Seattle right now, but on a multigenerational scale. The government would essentially “let go” of certain areas of major metropolitan cities, and the homeless and unemployed would be placed there to keep the “people of the asphalt” (to borrow a term from Brazil) feeling safe, and keep the homeless out of the central parts of the city. Police would essentially move the most impoverished away from urban centers, and a mix of the impoverished, downtrodden, and utopian creatives would create a civilization that the formal government would acknowledge but not intervene in unless it spilled out of the borders. Food would be grown in community gardens and bartering or local currencies (which also have a history in the US and are being used in some communities right now) would be standard.

I think this is the only possible conclusion to the unfettered capitalism as we are currently defining it. Without massive federal spending direct to the masses or a massive overhaul to what it means to have a living wage we are not going to have enough jobs or consumer demand to keep the economy going at the rates necessary for all to thrive. 

If I could come out in favor of a solution it would be a federal jobs guarantee, where the government essentially creates jobs based in coronavirus testing, infrastructure repair, caregiving, food bank management, healthcare, and more. This nationalization would solve more problems than a strict UBI, but it creates its own issues and is much more infrastructure to manage.

It is almost politically impossible to even talk about such feats in government spending until things get much worse, however, so I’m thinking we’re going to start seeing more uprisings and examples of the former before we see revolution in the latter.",9,1593233962,[],,,

Capitalism is an economic system, which means private individuals or corporations, through their capital, control the means of production. They sell their goods and services in a market. A contrasting system would be socialism, where the workers control the means of production.
