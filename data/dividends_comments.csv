t3_352fhu,cr0d8no,"The loose monetary policy is achieved by reducing the interest rates, which means investors who rely on fixed income asset classes such as bonds to generate monthly/quarterly/annual income now have to look elsewhere - as that market is yielding close to nothing. This has caused ppl to turn to stocks - esp dividend paying stocks - to generate their income. The dividend income stocks have resulted in higher valuation over the last few years because of this - as investors, who normally paid 15 times earnings (P/E = 15) for a company's stock are now ready to pay 18, 20, 25 times earnings. So, in the hunt for yield, investors are ready to pay more for the initial stock price - thus driving up prices. This is especially true for bond-substitutes such as Utilities, REITs and MLPs. The increase in stock price of course means that the yield has fallen lower and lower on these stocks and will eventually return to balance once the interest rates rise and the investors return back to the safety of bonds.

The companies on the other hand - have seen some great growth in their earnings over the years, both as a combination of loose money and as the overall economy improves. In addition, companies can borrow money at record low rates and invest it for future growth. Unfortunately, most companies have now resorted to financial engineering - which is - they borrow money at the low rates available - but instead of investing for long term growth - they are just buying back their own stock (which is a way for management to reward themselves), trying to prop up the EPS numbers and looking for short term performance results. Once the gravy train ends, things should return back to normal.

t3_5rplcr,dd9802g,"Different people have different criteria, but I will say the majority of dividend investors like myself tend to look for a dividend that is safe and is known to provide a good return on top of it. So a lot of dividend investors look to the blue chip stocks. In a nutshell, here's my criteria

1. At least 10 years of increasing dividends.
2. Dividend Yield above the average (which currently sits around 2.5%)
3. Payout Ratio under 70%. Some people use earnings and/or cash to determine the payout ratio.
4. Dividend Growth Rate above 10% (average a dividend will increase per annum)

Some investors have criteria for PE ratio and other stats in order to give stocks a good/fair price value and then buy whenever the stocks dip below their good price threshold. You don't have to worry too much about this if you're a long term holder but there's nothing wrong with taking advantage when the market decides to dip hard on a good stock.

Funds like this can be a great tool for investors who don't have as much time to research the market. If you want growing dividends in the next 5-15 years I would check out dividend growth investing. 

Many companies grow their dividends every year and have been doing so for 30, 40, 50 years. You could certainly pick a few of the holdings from this fund, but I would say there are probably better options out there. 

The fund's yield is only 1.25% which is very low. I know there are funds with much higher yields than that if you want to stick with a dividend fund. I know Vanguard has a high yield dividend fund (VHDYX) which yields near 2.7% currently. Not to mention the expense ratio is much lower. 

If you want to pick some holdings you can certainly find stocks with yields closer to 3% and dividend growth rates of 5-10% per year.

In both cases, for the time being, buy and hold.  Don't even think about selling for a year.   Just let it sit there and do it's thing.  Buy some more stocks with the dividends (or let the broker auto roll the dividends into more of the same if they allow it).     Don't look at this as income, but more as long term savings.   As you learn more you can change that, but for now, don't plan on it.

Further, you might be want to look into doing an IRA now and start putting away for retirement.

BlindTreeFrog has listed some great advice to start investing. 

I'm a self taught investor, although I graduated college from the business school in computer information systems and had some knowledge on investing. 

I prefer dividend growth investing which is investing in high quality companies that continually pay and raise dividends year after year. A few examples are companies like Johnson and Johnson and Proctor & Gamble. 

Since you are young you are able to tolerate more risk and I would definitely look into high growth companies as well like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Tesla, Netflix, Alibaba, etc. 

ETFs are great because you don't have to worry about managing them. 

You can also look into an app called Acorns which basically allows you to invest smaller dollar amounts $5+ a time into certain Vanguard funds and it is free if you have a .edu e-mail address. 

Stockpile is another way to get smaller amounts into the market by buying partial shares of companies for $1 a trade. 

I recently started a blog called Millennial Dividends where I track my progress to financial independence through dividend growth investing. I've made over $6k in dividends and will receive around $4k in dividends alone this year. I started dividend growth investing around 2014 and have already made incredible progress.

The size of the annual dividend does not matter as much as the consistency to me. Although, I will say, once I reached my weekly dividend goal, then I went back and focused on increasing the annual div return.

And congratulations on your decision to start investing.  First, since you state “it’d be nice to have some cushion for later in life,” I presume you are looking for dividend stocks that will grow (versus generating income now - more on that later).
.
First, which platform to use to buy stocks:  There’s no such thing as a free lunch (aka “anytime you get something for free, you are probably paying too much”).  I suggest one of the brokers that uses IEX (I am going to shift to Interactive Brokers from TDAmeritrade later this year).  TDAmeritrade and most others that don’t use IEX receive fees from companies that execute their trades, in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  The only way they can do this is by making money off your transactions.  It’s just hidden and not charged by your broker, giving the illusion of “free.”  IEX brokers don’t do this.  That is transparency.  https://iextrading.com/trading/#members
(Here’s a short into to IEX:  https://youtu.be/qGn_RgnRE5w. Traditional brokers hate IEX, as it poses a risk to their business models.)
.
The next question is what kind of account to open.  If you are investing for future retirement, then the question comes to a traditional or Roth IRA.  Under a traditional IRA, you deduct your contributions from your current year taxes, but pay income tax on your contributions and growth upon withdrawal.  Under a Roth IRA, you don’t deduct your contributions and pay NO income tax on your contributions and growth upon withdrawal.  If you are indeed interested in growth over the long haul, I suggest a Roth as a general rule.  Both types of IRAs have contribution limits.  If you are interested in current income, then a taxable account is required (and has no contribution limit).
.
As a source for what to invest in given the presumed focus on growth over time, I suggest the American Association of Individual Investors Dividend Investing portfolio.  Their portfolio is built around the proven idea that quality stocks that consistently pay a dividend go up in value faster over time than those that do not.  Their information is very educational in that you can deep dive into it as much or as little as you want.  That is, you can just choose which of the stocks in their portfolio appeal to you and buy them, or you can dig into their charts and explanations to better understand their rationale.  It’s a couple of hundred dollars a year.  The subscription also includes general membership, which includes opportunities to go to local events as well as AAII’s general investing info.  www.aiaa.com
.
If you are looking for current dividend income, I suggest Kiplinger’s Investing for Income newsletter.  I’ve found it’s the best for me.  I don’t use all their picks and own some stocks they don’t list, but list and their info is the most helpful dividend income news I have found.
.
I do not recommend the Motley Fool’s dividend newsletter.  I used to get it, but found their analysis wasn’t rigorous enough for me.  The final straw came when a stock they had recommended for a long period of time (StoneMor Partners) slashed its dividend due to a cash shortage after months of MF saying it was safe.  Unanticipated cuts can happen, but it was MF’s reaction that made me drop MF.  I’ll sum up MF’s reaction as “StoneMor cutting their dividend is proof their management doesn’t understand business.”  Well, I took that as a reflection on MF recommending a company for so long that “doesn’t understand business.”  Fortunately, I hadn’t bought StoneMor, but nevertheless their reaction to StoneMor’s dividend cut in light of MF’s long running recommendation was enough to convince me that MF wasn’t rigorous enough in its analysis.
.
There are other dividend newsletters I subscribed to through the years (as well as checking this sub for ideas), but I’ve found AAII’s to be the best for appreciation/long term growth and Kiplinger’s to be the best for income.
.
A couple of other thoughts:
Some high yielders are foreign stocks.  This brings currency fluctuations into your account plus probably some foreign tax withholding (which, in most cases, washes out of your US income taxes).  One of my foreign stocks went from 10% withholding to (gulp) 35% withholding due to the host country tax laws.  That will wash out, but in the meantime it messes up my cash flow big time.  I’m shying away from foreign stocks for that reason.
.
Be aware that LPs (limited partnerships) and MLPs (master limited partnerships) can generate great cash flow (some of it tax deferred), but cannot be put in an IRA (without really complicated tax issues likely arising), will complicate your taxes by issuing a K-1 (a complex form that a tax accountant will probably charge you $100 for each that’s on your return, and good luck figuring out a K-1 if you don’t use a tax accountant), and will generate a future tax liability upon sale.  If you still want an LP or an MLP regardless, make sure it’s a large enough to generate enough income to offset the added cost of someone else doing your taxes.
.
Now is the best time to invest... always.  Anything else is “market timing” which doesn’t work.  Just put in the same amount of money over time and watch your portfolio grow in the long run.  Can the value of your stocks go down in the short run?  Yes, and they WILL.  The question is what you do about it.  That lowered value only becomes a “loss” when you sell the stock and lock in that lower sales price.
.
The above said, if you are looking for dividend payers that will provide you with current income (i.e. generally the higher yielders) be aware that rising interest rates (such as we are facing now) tend to lower the value of these stocks.  If you are going for stocks such as those in AAII’s dividend portfolio, I wouldn’t worry too much about that.  But even Kiplinger’s is advising a bit of caution of late. 
.
Again, congrats on getting started.
If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.

t3_9k2tr3,e723tzh,"I just started doing this and had the exact same thing you're asking going through my head before I started.  I'll give you what I did and hopefully it helps.  
So I started on Acorns back in March 2018.  Its a simple app that I link to my bank and it rounds up every purchase I make to the next dollar then invests the change into a portfolio I was directed to select.  They start by asking you what type of investor you are then pick the portfolio for you.  I was more safe so I guess it went to bonds/dividend type.  Its a type of thing where you set it and forget it, they do the work of researching stocks.  So after a month I invested my change and had around $100 in Acorns and saw my gains up $2.00.  I was curious why, I know stocks go up and down, so I looked and it said I gained $0.17 dividend and the rest were from stocks going up.  Its not much but for about $100 this was amazing for me. 

Why tell you this?  Because this fueled my urge to find Robinhood.  I have always known of stock trading platforms cost money from all the commercials.  So I never really got into it because trading one stock and paying a $5 fee was outrageous to me.  How was I suppose to make money if the stock didn't go up $10.  Too rich for me as a beginner, so that's where Robinhood made me make the plunge.  Robinhood allows me to buy and sell stocks commission free, thats right NO FEE!  Unfortunately I did not use a friend referral when I started Robinhood, I didn't know.  But that was fine, what I didn't know didn't hurt me.  It was just one free stock that Robinhood chooses.  

So I started out with $500 and instantly threw it at big names like Apple, Facebook, Ford and some random thread said ORC.  I have gained 0.73 off Apple just a month after I started and was astonished!  Then this ORC thing that I had no idea about(dont just follow some random internet person's anonymous suggestion), paid a monthly dividend!  It was $0.08 but what the heck, FREE MONEY(not really free)!!!!  I was hooked!  I started doing some growth dividend stocks, REIT stocks, some things like TSLA/Facebook(not dividend), and just felt dividend stocks were my calling, probably because FB is still $10 less than when I bought it, I don't like being negative. Last month I got $2.03 and this month i'm getting $3.67 from dividends.  

I don't have a long history of investing and i'm a beginner.  I hope my short story helps you. 
I highly suggest starting a Robinhood account, and if you want my friend link its  share.robinhood.com/jasonw2061   The link only give you and myself a free stock, I've gotten 2 so far and they were just around the $4 mark.  So don't get your hopes up with trying to land a berkshire or AMZN stock.  

Once you have your trading platform, Robinhood, TDameritrade, Fidelity, etc.. Google has shown me a lot of stock info, leading to nasdaq sites and learning sites.  Just get out there and learn.  Probably not the best suggestions but again, I hope it helps.

My Dividend Report, January, 2019

My monthly total for January, 2019 was $419.74 across all accounts. Quarterly was $779.47, and annually $2,738.42. Average monthly dividend is now $228.20.

My overall yield across all accounts is 11.67%, with an expected gain of $3,326.65 over the next 12 months. That's a jump because of some updated dividend calculations on some of the variable dividend stocks.  We're at a high return point for some of the leveraged stocks.  I'm at 6.17% of my goal, currently earning $1.60 per hour in dividends alone. (Annual/(52 weeks, 40 hours a week))

I checked my annual results, and 2018's dividend total was 26.38% higher than 2017's.  I don't know if that will sustain itself, but I'm certainly going to try.

t3_an1u87,efr6jka,"Very cool, I like seeing people use new tools in their portfolios.

I would offer two bits of advice for enhancing a great tool you already have.

1. Create a metric for increasing value. A lot of the stocks on your list are REITs or BDCs and it often happens their share value never grows, they pay out huge dividends and then end up cutting the dividend because they can’t afford it. Then you’ve invested into a company that no longer is delivering the only reason you picked it.

Find companies that have good dividend yields and have a track record of building share value, the dividends will come and you will have a portfolio that will be much safer and will grow over time.

2. This one would be just for fun, pull alpha and beta for all of these stocks to compare your risk ve the market and your ror over the market. Incorporate those into your solver to find a solution that maximizes your return while minimizing risk

t3_anezm0,efukq3q,"I use Robinhood and hold about 20% of my porfolio here because of their free options trading, covered calls is pretty common in the dividend investing world,  and M1 does not offer this. You don't want to do that with all of your holdings though, just the stable ones, and that's partially the reason for being the smaller side of my portfolio. The one downside to Robinhood is that their platform does not have hardly any of the bells and whistles of most of the other more mature platforms, like a DRIP setup. That said, I do root for them and hope to see them grow, they are a minnow in a shark pond with their free trades for all model, my old broker TD Ameritrade wouldn't go to free, so I moved on. 

 M1 has the other 80% of my portfolio, I use it for Roth IRA's (something Robinhood does not offer), and a taxable account. Like others have said, M1 has partial shares investing at no cost, with pies that can have pies, so you can basically build your own etf's with this kind of setup. it's beautiful. I would like to add that M1 is already a nice platform, and is maturing quickly, coming out with new improvements constantly. {rant} If the guys over at r/M1Finance read this, the only thing I would improve would be to add a checkbox to place holdings on a hold only (no buy status) or to let us be able to transfer into new pies without having to sell and then buy back the whole holding, just dropping to 1% does not mean it will not buy again if you are heavily diversified {/rant}. Seriously though, I wish M1 had come out 20 years ago, their partial shares / no fee investing is a game changer for investors, that's just my opinion though. 

Unfortunately, neither offer a proper DRIP on stocks where you can get the discounts a true drip program has. Both Robinhood and M1 have the dividends paid directly back to the account, it is then on you to choose to reinvest it as you see fit, buying shares in robinhood and/or M1. M1 has the benefit of being able to just use their auto-invest setting, which is available because of the partial shares investing approach they have.

t3_apn7bc,egb535x,"This is my favorite strategy with my dividend stocks.  I currently have CCs on SKT, T, IRM, KIM.  Not all dividend stocks have good option choices so look into that first.

Here is an example of how I do it.  Let's take SKT (prices as of 2/12/19).  I look at their chart and for the last 18months it has not been above about $24.  So I would look to sell a $24 CC that would pay a couple percent.  So, I would sell the JUN19 - $24 for 0.70 cents.  SKT is currently at $22.42 so this CC would pay me 3.1%.  If I can do this 2 times during the year (sell maybe the DEC19 when JUN19 expires) this gives me an extra 6.2%.  So, with SKT currently paying 6.24% yield plus another 6.2% from CCs gives me a total of 12.44% for the year.

This is just a brief example some things to be aware of is ex-dates, cost of option execution if it happens, and any tax implications for your situation.  Be aware if your CC is in-the-money it can be assigned especially if it is during the ex-dates.

I really love this strategy and works for me.

t3_awvp61,ehphtll,"So I'm not familiar with fire but here is why I'm doing dividend investments:

* firms that issue dividends tend to be more financially stable


* I want a steady income rather than having to watch for growth and then selling then having to look for a new company to invest in


* holding the stock for a long enough period of time changes the tax implications so it goes from income to cap gains


* At some point you stop reinvesting the dividends and let the stocks just throw off dividends so you have income and you don't have to worry about selling the 4%",8,1551632655.0
t3_awvp61,ehqaidw,"Why not do both?

I use index funds and dividend stocks in my retirement accounts.  Mostly REITS, where i'm not taxes at my income rate.  See, that's the part that's often missing..taxes.  Qualified dividends are taxed much less than income generated from the sale of stock.  If your following the 4% withdraw rule, your likely paying taxes on capital gains from the sale of your stocks that have gone up in value.  

Most dividend investors are lowering the cost basis on the dividends they receive because that becomes a big part of their income in retirement.  Also, because its taxed differently, most retirees plan to drop a tax bracket.  Check [this](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp) out for reference.

&#x200B;

In addition to that, most never actually plan to see their dividend stocks.  They're not actually even considering its appreciation.  They're investing for income and income growth.

It's not that one is ""better"" than another.  There is just better use cases for each, depending on the situation.",4,1551654399.0
t3_awvp61,ehpssqb,"Withdrawing 4% can have its flaws, what if we are in a period of a recession/depression? If you withdraw 4% you will burn through it by far faster than anticipated.  


In the end they do net the same thing, although I'd really prefer to holding on to the total number of shares that I have rather than have to sell and take capital gains.  


The tax advantages for dividend investing have gotten better since the tax reform, at least this is if you buy companies that offer a qualified dividend. Because they will fall into 1 of three tax brackets based on your income, 0%, 15%, or 20%. Taxes that come out of your paycheck can anywhere from 15%+.  


It's really not all that much work if you really think about it, once you know what you are looking for with dividend stocks, half the homework is already done. The downside with index investing is well, you are going to get what that market did for the year. Well for example the tech sector has blown up over the past 3-4 years, if you were in majority of tech, you could easily be sitting on 35%+ gains over this time period (Again, this wouldn't be recommended, it's always best to be diversified and never put all your eggs in one basket...even if it is in a index).  


Index investing is for those that want to set it and forget it, those that really don't care so much about the inner workings of businesses. Personally I like to keep my shares and never sell them, have the company pay for my living expenses, at a qualified tax rate that will be cheaper in tax then working for somebody else.",3,1551640936.0

My monthly total for March, 2019 was $109.32 across all accounts. Quarterly was $726.34, and annually $2803.94. Average monthly dividend is now $233.66.

&#x200B;

My overall yield across all accounts is 10.95%, with an expected gain of $3,236.94 over the next 12 months. That's up and growing, which is what I like to see. I'm at 5.888% of my goal, currently earning $1.56 per hour in dividends alone. (Annual/(52 weeks, 40 hours a week))  If you're following my numbers, the % to goal went down because my goal is based on my wages, and I got a raise.  Yin and yang. :)

&#x200B;

This is the sixth month with a total above $100, and it's possible that September18 might have been the last month below that threshold. Last March was a low point, so I wasn't sure if it would break the glass ceiling.  It did.

&#x200B;

Google Finance fixed the issues with Funds, so I can see all of my numbers accurately again.  Here's hoping it was part of an expansion or improvement of that service.  I really miss the old Google Finance.

&#x200B;

I still see my monthly and annual totals on an uptrend, gaining ground every month.  My strategy is working, and based on that yield I'm doubling my money every 6.57 years.  And that doesn't include the new money that I put in every paycheck.  It's also important to note that the increase from dividends is exceeding what I'm able to add in.  That's a milestone.  Here's to future milestones.",4,1553957459.0

&#x200B;

I'd say, you don't have to rush in to the market. But start now, adding 5-10% of the savings per month into quality dividend-paying stocks with preferably low/no debt. Also I suppose you're going to add to your portfolio either monthly or quarterly, so even if the market slips down 30-50% you will continue to add in the decline, bringing your average price down for your investments. Don't see a market downturn as something negative, but rather something positive as it opens up a great amount of opportunities. 

&#x200B;

It's hard/impossible to wait till the market bottoms out of a big decline and think you're going to time that bottom and then put it all in. Changes are, even if you sit there that day that the market actually bottoms, ready on the buy button, you wont buy cause of fear. Then after the market has rallied back 20-30% from the bottom you will never buy into it anyways cause you're mad you missed the bottom. Start now.

EX\] If you bought Caterpillar (CAT) at $80 back in 2014 at the time the dividend was .6 a Q or $2.4 a year. That translated to a 3% Yield. Fast forward to today. CAT is at $1.03 a quarter or $4.12 a year which translates to a 5.15% yield.  IID is at 3.5% yield and hasn't increase their dividend. In fact the stock has been dropping over the last 5 years. Not a stock I would personally buy. Stocks that have good fundamentals and increase their dividend yearly usually go up in value as well, usually maintaining the same yield. Take Coca Cola (KO) for instance.

Anyway, back to CAT- This means that if you invested 1M in 2014, you would've made 30K that year. Now, in the 2019-2020 year you would make 51.5k. And this is without considering the massive capital gain or re-invested dividends. This strategy, as long as you choose stocks wisely, stocks that consistently grow their dividends will always beat those that don't grow their dividend ( ceteris paribus ). 

The fact that you're 20 means that you easily have 45+ years to invest before you retire. if you use the dividend growth + reinvestment strategy, you'll have more money that you'll know what to do with. Choosing the right stocks of course. 

 Then you can make a trust and help society out with donations xP",2,1558039471.0
t3_bqznj7,eo9e46p,"A lot of people here invest in stocks with high initial yields. I prefer to invest in companies and ETFs that consistently raise the dividend every year. 
For example 3M used to pay 1.96 a year in dividends back in 2009. Ten years later it pays 5.76 almost triple what it was. If you bought at 75 in 2009 (not the highest or lowest price for that year), then your current yield on cost is 7.68%. Plus the stock is now 166, so about double in capital appreciation. Please note, capital appreciation is not my focus, but yield on cost is. I am in my twenties and have many years to enjoy the dividend growth strategy.

t3_bwc61b,epwkf8g,"It can be confusing I get that! But hopefully I can clear a few things up for you. First the percentage you are seeing is the annual expected dividend payment divided by the price. The dollar amount is the amount per share expected to be paid this year (it assumes no cuts or increases). For example, lets say company abc has a share price of $50 and last quarter offered a per share dividend of $0.25. That would mean the dividend dollar amount per share per year would be $1.00 and the dividend yield percentage would be 2%. So in this case buying one share of this company at $50 means you should expect $1 back from the company over one year as a dividend, which is a return of 2%.

&#x200B;

As a general rule, look at the percentage over the nominal dollar amount, because it answers the question, what percentage of my investment in this company will return to me in a dividend payment? Also, make sure you keep in mind that dividend cuts or increases can change things, and are worth monitoring.

t3_bwc61b,epwjspa,"> certain stocks offer dividends at different percentages, but also a dollar amount for each stock?

Dividend paying stocks pay a dollar amount, the percentage is calculated: the dividend/price=yield (percentage)

Thus the yield changes as the stock price changes, the dollar amount remains the same until the board announces a new amount.

>Does this mean if you hold onto those dividend stocks, within one year, you will get the percentage they offer and the dollar amount per stock as profit?

If you own the stock on the ""ex-dividend date"" you receive the dividend amount for that stock, the percentage (yield) may change since it depends on the ever changing price of the stock.

I think it would be prudent to do small token raises for the next couple of years and funnel more money into paying down debt and R&D.

Maybe after 21-22 they can get back to raising dividends at double digit increases again.

JNJ is a stable defensive stock that has paid out a dividend for decades, so you know both your investment and the dividend is safe.  Other companies may pay out a big dividend to boost their stock price, but then may go bankrupt or end up lowering, or even dropping, their dividend which lowers the stock price leaving the trader stuck with a loss in a stock that is going nowhere.

Maybe company is undergoing some big problems and thats why the price is so low. Its also possible company might have to cut that dividend to half or maybe eliminate it. So it might happen that you buy the stock today and few months later company just slashes divided. The stock price goes down even more and you loose a lot of principal value.

If company payout ratio is 30%, that means it has 70% room to spend it on itself for growth right? So I would try below 50% or lower, though sometimes that varies by sector and such. Next, look at who has been increasing their dividend in last 10-25 yrs; those are usually safer bets. No investment is really ""safe"" but some are riskier and some are not.

t3_ci46wu,ev1jemv,"Usually a good fast growing company with low dividend yield also increases dividend at a faster rate.

For e.g Starbucks has raised dividends about average of 24% per year for last 5 years.

that also brings a lot of price appreciation with it. SBUX in AUG 2014 was at 38$ per share, dividend at .52$ annually and around 1.3% yield.

SBUX today at 97$ a share, dividend at 1.44$ per share and around 1.47% yield based on today's price.

However if you had bought SBUX in 2014 and held till today, your dividend yield would have been  3.75% on cost.

Not to mention the 2.8x price appreciation.

No savings account will match that.

SBUX is like a dividend growth stock. Has low yield, grows fast, grows dividend fast.

On the other hand you have dividend yield stocks, which just have high yield but do not grow dividends that fast. or grow at all, so their price doesnt appreciate that fast. example would be T or many utility stocks.

t3_ci46wu,ev1kpxh,"If you're investing for income, it doesn't make sense to go for low yield stocks, but if you're investing for total return, it does.

As an example, in 2015 I bought MSFT. In that time, it's grown from $45.79  to $141.23, or an increase of around 210%.  The dividend has also gone from $1.24 to $1.84 annually. That's up almost 50%.  

If I was only interested in income, this wouldn't be a great use of my investment money as it yields only 1.3% currently. I could get much better income with a higher yielding company. However, there's no doubt that my MSFT buy was a great purchase, as I'm up over 200% and am getting paid 50% more in dividends. Since I don't need the income for at least 15 years, I'm very happy to sit back and collect both the dividend and the capital gains. 

If I needed the money now, I'd sell MSFT and put it into an income focused stock. Those tend not to grow as fast.  For example, T yields around 6%, so it's a much better income stock than MSFT. Coincidentally, I purchased that in 2015 as well, at a cost of $35.13. Today, it's $34.15. The stock price has gone nowhere, as they're paying out their excess cash in dividends rather than using it to increase the value of the company overall. 

Also, when looking at dividend stocks, remember that high yield is high risk.  Often times high yielding stocks have high yields because their stock price is falling due to structural issues. They might be about to cut their dividend to try and save cash to save the business, leaving you with a low yield, low quality stock.

t3_d6c98i,f0t3ppy,"Try out Seeking Alpha's portfolio function.  I don't use it, but I believe I've heard it can.

OR, if you want something more complicated, then you can do what I did. I personally created my own Google spreadsheet to tell me, since I like playing around with my own portfolio spreadsheet. You can pull today's dividend dynamically from a website in Googlespreadsheets like this:

=regexextract(index(ImportHtml(""http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=""&A1, ""table"", 11),7,2),""/\*\[0-9.\]+/\*"") 

Where A is the column where you store your tickers (so A1 is where you have something, like MSFT, A2 might be JNJ, etc).

Then you have one column for your manual dividend (lets say D), and another column where it scrapes html to populate it automatically (lets say AL).

When your manual dividend (column D) < automatic dividend (column AL), it means they raised your dividend, (so you can highlight your manual dividend's cell in green).

When your manual dividend > automatic dividend, that means they cut your dividend so you can highlight your manual in red. 

So, in column D you add these conditionals:

Custom Formula =D1-AL1<0 then red color

Custom Formula =D1-AL1 >0 then green color

(in a range from 1 to however many rows of stocks you have)

You then seed column D with today's dividend manually.

Then in the future, when column AL changes (since it is automatically updating the manual dividend based on when finviz updates the dividend of your stock), your entry in column D will be either red or green.  That means that you either had a dividend raised or lowered since you were last in it.

Then you update your entry in D to be the same as the one in AL and it will clear the color back to no coloring, and then you are back to the initial state.

So, I find it really handy.  The other day I opened my spreadsheet and saw that I company of mine had increased its dividend (it was highlighted in green), and I was surprised (cause I normally stay on top of this stuff by following news and such).  So then I just change the dividend that was in green to be what the automatic one was, to both reset the color back t o none, and to reset the spreadsheet.

t3_dre5gz,f6hpvr1,"Unless you need a specific instrument, focus on total return for your financial situation. As with so many things in investing, many superficially similar investment vehicles are aligned to deal with different financial and tax situations. To your point, having a fair distribution of growth oriented stocks and pivoting more towards dividend stocks near retirement is a fair approach to consider.

From my POV, a dividend focus is preferable if you are approaching a point where you want a predictable, growing cash stream which you can use for life expenses(aka retirement/money for widows and orphans). I would argue that dividend stocks tend to have more disciplined managements who are forced to think in terms of sustained, longer term performance, and boards of directors who don't see quite as much opportunity for reinvesting cash back into the business for growth, as opposed to reusing that money to invest elsewhere. The downside with dividends is the tax treatment on the payouts which tends to be at higher rates than cap gains for many.

&#x200B;

Growth companies tend to have greater opportunities/needs for internal reinvestment, and hence they plow funds back into themselves, rather than you reinvesting money from dividends which were taxed to buy the same stock. Until you sell, you don't have any taxable events. In theory, a person can also sell fractional portions of growth stocks to simulate dividends. In practice, the trouble is that you may need to free up cash with that asset at times when the stock is depressed, and the only way to do so is to sell from your position. If you need a fixed amount, you need to sell more at low prices.  This is especially likely to be a problem periodically if you want a steady stream of cash.

&#x200B;

If you are currently focused on **asset accumulation**, the government is getting a slice of every dividend you are reinvesting from taxes. A **growth investor** gets favorable tax treatment with a stocks which reinvest in themselves- they would typically want to focus on the investment which is likely to give the best overall return. US Dividend stocks tend to slightly outperform in studies I've seen, but they also have to do a little better in relation to the friction of higher taxes - For most, a diversified mix of growth and dividend stocks is likely a good bet.

If you are approaching a point where you want to predictable cash flow, dividends and bonds can put out reasonably reliable streams. In that context, the value of predictability can outweigh the tax disadvantage, and be more compelling. Stock prices and the mood of folks on the stock market won't impact payouts.  Of course, dividends and interest can fail if the underlying entity is in trouble(Dividend rates are often highest on weak ""discounted"" companies which are under-performing, and conversely, strong companies often have low dividend yields relative to their popular high stock price). Investors in companies like ""old reliable"" GE learned this when their generous dividend was slashed.

A big thing to keep in mind, optimality differs based on your account. If you have funds in a 401K or IRA, you're not getting taxed on income events like dividends at the time, so it can potentially be more advantageous to have investments like dividend stocks and bonds in such accounts, and growth oriented investments in regular brokerage (especially as you can deduct cap losses against cap gains).",2,1572861387.0

Are dividend stocks a good option for incrementally building a strong portfolio over the span of a career? Yes, certainly.

Is it the best option for building a strong portfolio, which you generally won't tap until the end of your career?  I'd personally suggest that you can do better, and caution about being overly dogmatic.

Why? In general, your returns are penalized due to dividends reinvested to taxes, especially if you are completely overlooking robust, healthy growth stocks, which don't pay dividends (yet), and adding risk by reducing the diversification of your portfolio.

Do you need the cash flow dividends provide right now? If not, consider a diversified mix of high performing businesses across industries (regardless of dividend) as a more efficient/stable vehicle for consistent growth during your working years. Keep your eyes open to the performance of indexes covering different scales(e.g. small, mid and large cap) and financial structures(e.g. growth vs dividend), as what does well today, isn't identical to what will do well tomorrow.

I would argue, you want a portfolio which grows in a tax optimal manner, and can be restructured to more heavily emphasize steady cash flow (through dividends and bond interest) **as you approach retirement, when you need a stable income**.

What is the basis of my recommendation? I am a mixed investor who has been active since \~2000. Over the last 10 years, 60% of my main brokerage account value has come from market value growth, 10% from dividends. My plan is to retire on predictable dividend cash flow (I'm at \~24k/yr at this point), but you run a risk of kneecapping your portfolio growth if you over-pivot towards high yield, slow growth dividend stocks, to the exclusion of the broader market.

I'm sure someone will pull out a chart referring to the out-performance of Dividend Aristocrats vs S&P 500 over the last 25 years, but an important point is that index was only created in 2006, long after those companies had already been kicking ass. For the last few years, Dividend Aristocrats are victims of their popularity, have been getting over-priced from a P/E standpoint, falling behind the S&P. No one can say with certainty what sectors are going to outperform.

When a company pays out dividends, this means the board of directors(an elected group of shareholders like you), felt money the company has is best returned to shareholders, rather then held or internally used by the company for growth. Dividends are operate as a fixed amount of dollars and  cents, generally paid on a quarterly basis. The stock price doesn't drive dividends, the health of the business and its capital needs do. The price people are willing to pay for a stock does react to dividends.

(Edited to address my earlier hand-waving inaccuracy) On the ""ex-dividend"" date where the recipients of dividends are recognized, the value of a stock generally goes down by an amount matching  the value of the dividend, as that value is gone from the share(and underlying business) and will be paid out to the recognized holders from the ex div date on the dividend pay date.

t3_e1j7kd,f8qj1lz,"So I am in a similar stage as you my good sir and each month my aim is for an 8% gain on mopay stocks be it mostly US, Canadian, and International.

Global X makes some wonderful ETFs that would be a good start for you.

Specifically their Super Dividend ETF and their super dividend REIT ETF. (These both pay out monthly)

Now many people say to avoid HIGH YIELD ETFS, but watch out specifically for ones with a decreasing value not covered by dividend. Ie stock pays out 3 dollars a year but it's been losing 3 dollars each year in its own value.

DHY is a bond stock that pays .019 cents but only costs $2.51-3.

Mopay stands for monthly paying. With your capital it is SEVERELY hard to find a good portfolio mix that would net you $200 or more.

(Aim for 8 percent mopays to get the cashflow started, afterwards when you need to stabilize this portfolio work on going towards less risky investments and focus more on diversification after getting the cash flow)

SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO GET CASH FLOW.

REITs are great for that, however there can be increased tax responsibility. But the goal of THIS IS CASHFLOW. So understand that starting with an account that may have more tax needs (costs) will likely net you more and at the very least get your portfolio going at which point you can invest later into other things.

So a couple of good mopays

APLE, SREIT, SDIV, HYLD (wouldn't recommend, it's a high yield etf - see above), DHY, and ORC (Outlook doesnt look good) 

There is also AMERICAN HOTEL INCOME REIT

Mostly 150 ÷ $30000 (150 was gotten by dividing $30,000 by your wanted monthly ($200))  which equals out to wanting a minimum of a .0666% payout each month. (Btw when you X .0666 x 12 (months) you do need a minimum off an 8 percent gain per year. 

Now stocks change in value, you will have to monitor and make up for the amount of equity and cash available for your account - ie the goal is to maintain value along with maintaining and growing yourself.

So if you got $200x12 = $2400
And you lose $400 to stock depreciation then you need to make sure that you're restocking this account and keeping it maintained.


I'm 20, I work a shit job and I do this on the side. My account has a value of less then $2200. So take this advice in stride.

After 3 months I got my first dividend last week, and it's a paltry $6.51, but in 6 days I get my second dividend, and it pays out $14. The third stock I misread when the pay out was and it comes two months from now. But I have spent these last three months planning the next 6 stocks I intend to invest in. 

&#x200B;

It's encouraging and beneficial to me to take advantage of fractional shares to keep myself motivated. Any dividends I get can be rolled into a fractional share for the next ones that I need to round out my portfolio. Also beneficial to use them for a quick mental reward for budgeting and saving well every month. I have a planned amount I invest every month, but I also invest any money left over from my paycheck that I budgeted but didn't use. Budgeted $60 for gas and groceries for two weeks and only end up spending $55? That's $5 I can use to add a fractional share.   


This month alone so far I have gotten three ""rewards"" for myself to use towards expanding my dividends; I spent $8 less than I budgeted for groceries, $6.51 for my first dividend, and $4.83 earned as interest in a cash management account. That amounts to $19 that I used towards a fractional share of AT&T, which is about $39-ish. But I already had about $25 in a fractional T share so that $19 successfully rolled me into my next full share of the company.   


So for me personally, I think it really helps to just keep track of everything and budgeting and fractional shares really help keep me going. Especially useful for me that every time I buy shares I enter it in a spreadsheet that keeps track of how much I currently make/how much I can make with the amount of shares I have. On top of that, every time I buy fractional shares and it rounds into another full share, I update that spreadsheet and re-calculate into that spreadsheet the amount I now make. Looking at the position growing just by tossing $5-10 every week or so into the account on top of my planned amounts keeps me routinely re-calculating how much I now make just by holding these shares.

t3_ej5yuv,fcw0tf8,"Hey Homiusmaximus, 

I've had success investing in mREITs such as AGNC and NRZ in the past.

I've had mixed results on the leveraged ETNS that had yields of 20%+.

They are listed as follows:  
MORL = Leveraged MREIT Index (Total return of 21%)  
CEFL = Leveraged CEF Index (Total return of 13%)  
BDCL = Leveraged BDC Index (Total loss of -4%) 

The 1 I lost a lot of money on was Infracap MLP, AMZA. I lost 37% of my principle but when factoring in dividends it was a loss of 13% so I got super lucky.

My experience has been mostly negative though and unless you benefit from harvesting losses for tax purposes, I wouldn't advise owning them at all.

If you're looking at a mature company, where its policy is to return the majority of the profit back to the shareholders, it's pretty common to see dividend yields of 5-6% and they're considered to be safe. Likewise, if you invest in REITs or BDCs, they are required by law to pay 90% of the income to shareholders so undoubtedly the yields will be higher. Unless the share price is in high demand, pushing the yield down. A perfect example of this would be a company like Realty Income (O) or Main Street Capital (MAIN), considered by many to be the best REIT and best BDC.

For that reason I am changing my portfolio to consist almost entirely of dividend  yielding stock and cash waiting for deployment opportunities.  I plan to weather any upcoming storms, continue to collect dividends and purchase more stocks on the dips. Timing any dips will be a complete guessing game, but at least I will have some cash sitting on the side lines. Purchases will be incremental and spread across the downward movement of the market.

As for when the market will start to move direction, and  enter a correction phase, a bear market or a recession, I don't pretend to know. I only know for sure that it will  happen eventually. I also believe eventually is less than 18 months away, and it could be quite painful.",14,1578369874.0

AT&T (T) is a dividend aristocrat. Paying and RAISING dividends since 1984.

At todays price of $38.09, its paying a 5.46% annual dividend yield. Looking at the history, it generally pays a dividend of between 4-6 percent at buy in.

the dividend climbs slowly.. just 1% increase if you bought in 2012.

REITs generally pay a higher dividend, but they are not qualified dividends, which means you are taxed as ordinary income. 

From Yahoo Finance: SPHD pays 4.07% yield, VIG = 1.71%,  VYM=3.03%, O= 3.64%

ATT seems like a pretty solid dividend stock, pays Quarterly and qualified.

O appears to be a REIT, so thats taxed like ordinary income. There could be an expense on those ETFs. I have not looked at the rate in which your selection climbs or drops. How many years would it take for VIG (1.71%) to reach ATT 's current 5.46% yield?

These two are exactly the same except for some technical differences. They track the same REIT index and are double leveraged. MORL is the original and MRRL is the remix. MORL doesn’t quote track indicative value since there are no new issuances (and may be one of the ETNs that UBS is redeeming soon if I’m not mistaken). MRRL is essentially the same but backed by one less legal entity (UBS Switzerland if I remember right). 

In my opinion the biggest risk by far with these is interest rate risk. First REITs are susceptible to interest rate risk because most of their assets are backed by mortgages. Then on top of that, the actual ETN takes on leverage to achieve double the performance of the underlying index. So changes in interest rates can massively affect the value of these notes.

The dividends, as far as I can tell, are based on the dividends issued by the companies comprising  the underlying index. So, the dividend each month is going to depend on the dividend issued by each underlying company in the index.",5,1579420682.0

so, lets assume all the numbers are true.

Coke, back in early 2000, had a dividend yield of 1.55%..which if you bought then, its now pulling a 7.31% dividend yield.

ATT , back in early 2000, had a dividend yield of 2.23%, which if you held today, is pulling a 4.75% dividend yield.

So although KO starts with a LOWER dividend yield, over time, it wins out, over a stock which STARTS with a  higher yield (T). So KO, has better ""growth"" potential.

CEN - Center Coast Brookfield MLP & Energy Infrastructure Fund

CEN is a MLP (Master Limited Partnership). which are taxed differently (for US residents)

I have to do research on the tax issues of MLP's.. but my simplistic and most likely erroneous understanding is..

MLP dividends, are considered ""RETURN ON CAPITAL"", and are not classified as ordinary or qualified. I don't know WHEN you get taxed on it. Im guessing when you SELL the stock.  Return on capital might be looked as a ""REFUND"" on the price you paid. If someone has a real good link on how MLPs play out for US taxes, id love to read it.",2,1579784566.0

With regards to investing in dividends, you invest in shares of companies or funds which then, based on their result, return dividends to their shareholders.
Before moving into buying shares which have a good dividend structure, you should start with the basics of stocks and also very much read up on the risks. This can be done with the regular books that have been shared a numerous amount of times.

if you Dollar Cost Averaged (DCA) GM a certain year til today, here are your results if you sold everything today:

STOCK\_RETURN + DIVIDEND\_RETURN = TOTAL\_RETURN

91.677% + 2.098% = 93.785%  year=2019   <== year you started DCA'ing.

91.200% + 4.126% = 95.328%  year=2018

91.246% + 6.369% = 97.618% Year = 2017

 95.206% + 9.001% = 104.215%   Year=2016

96.032% + 11.282% = 107.330% Year=2015

96.584% + 13.423% = 110.013% Year=2014

97.348% + 15.233% = 112.591%  Year=2013

Now for Coke:

112.772% + 1.648% = 114.443% Year=2019

119.226% + 3.383% = 122.621%  Year=2018

 122.577% + 5.105% = 127.694% Year=2017

 124.861% + 6.811% = 131.684% Year=2016

 127.605% + 8.555% = 136.172% Year=2015

 129.701% + 10.259% = 139.973%  Year=2014

131.655% + 11.885% = 143.549% Year=2013

Now that you know that GM stock has done crap historically, and even in these bull markets, you need to look very very very very deeply into your crystal ball to see if GM can really turn things around in the future. 

Oh, GM's dividend growth is FLAT as a pancake. GM has been paying $0.38 per share since 2016. no change. 

Coke has been paying AND INCREASING dividends for 50+ years. 

Coke is the consistent B student.

The only problem I have encountered with this strategy is that if a stock drops precipitously, your call will expire worthless (a good thing)‚ but then the premium to rewrite a new call at the same strike price will be extremely low. If you want to keep up the same level of weekly/monthly income, you would have to write an option for a much lower strike price, potentially below your cost basis, and risk being assigned to a trade that loses money.

This happened to me recently with NIO. Made 5% in a week off covered call premiums, but then the stock value crashed and the current bidding price at my old premium would barely net me 2% over the next week. This is a bigger deal with cheap stocks because they only trade options at wide increments in the strike price.

For me, dividends are for the future. I plan to hold my shares until retirement or later. Unless they cut their dividends, in which case I will sell those positions and put the money somewhere else. Since I intend to use the money for late in life, I re-invest all my dividends to act as compounding interest. I chose to build my initial portfolio based on dividend aristocrats in my price range that I like to buy myself security and peace of mind during whenever the next recession happens. Most of these aristocrats do not have a lot of Dividend growth however and hardly beat just having a high-yield savings account. Once these positions are filled in my portfolio, I intend to invest in more ""growth"" dividend stocks that give me the opportunity to increase my yearly dividend yield to a more stock market appropriate level of 6-9%.

 It would be cool to make a bunch of money all at once on some growth play every few years, but I have a very anxious personality and would no doubt be very nervous about one wrong turn meaning my investments were worthless, and feeling like it's not worth anything to me unless I cash out. I much prefer the peace of mind of getting paid money every month/quarter as a reward for my investment in these companies, which in turn I can use to purchase more shares for free, while never having to cash out my original shares to have value from my investment. 

Within 5 months of starting I have accumulated $200 worth of dividends I will earn every year, minimum...forever. By the end of this year I should be close to $350-400. I invest about $400-500 a month in the market, so by the end of this year, my dividends earned will be like if I got an extra month in the year to invest. Within the next 5-6 years I should be at the level of dividends that I'd get $250-300 a month, which is to me like having an extra ""free"" paycheck every month to buy stock with that the companies are paying me to buy. 

I don't read financial books and pretty much everyone thinks Warren Buffet is a God, so I won't bother recommending any.

It is a simple test to see how a company is doing, these normally tend to be lower yield stocks but ones that have stood the test of time. Sometimes you can get these great companies at a discount because of some market irrationality going on.    


My dividends are a byproduct of great businesses, not gambling like your at the casino looking at the yield and hoping its maintained not understanding what they do.   

I read a lot of the different dividend forums and am very surprised by the sheer number of people out there asking if this ""XYZ"" company is good ""its yielding 15%"" and then they have no idea what the company does, what its balance sheet looks like, or even why they want to buy it.

I'm also buying myself resilience. In the case of a stock market downturn, I can continue to buy down the slope because of my dividends. This will massively increase my holdings, so they'll boom when the market recovers. If the crash affects my job, I can fall back on the dividends, without having necessarily to touch capital.

I'm also buying faster retirement. I believe the 4% rule doesn't account well enough for dividend portfolios. If your investments are paying out dividends that cover your expenses, then you don't have to sell anything at all. This is a big stretch for almost everyone. But if you can get 50% of your necessary income from your dividends, you have to sell half as much to get your money. This extends the life of the nest egg, in my opinion

I know this may suck, but you can also get a room mate.  Although you could afford the condo all by yourself, you can think of the roommate rent as a dividend payment. The roommate will also cut down on utility bills, as you would split it.

You could also use the roommate rent to help pay for all the fun things you need in your new home. New TV, couches, refrigerator, washer dryer,  beds, new paint, etc. This is your home, this is where you come to relax and enjoy. Make it nice.

The Taxable Account only gets Qualified Dividends.

Cash Dividends/ REITS/ etc go into the retirement account.

The retirement account gets maxed out first, since all the returns are tax deferred. Compound tax free until you withdraw, which should be when you retire. and for the most part, you won't have a job, and less income. which means you withdraw at a lower tax bracket.

Right now, ALL the admission prices (stock prices) are dumping! Way dumping! But the dividend payments (your rent) has not changed.. which means you get a nice yield!

A favorite out here is $MO (Altria). The stock price has been dumping down to $40.37. They still pay $3.36 a year in dividends..  $3.36 / $40.37 = 8.3% Annual Dividend Yield!!!!

So you paid $40.37 to get a check for $3.36 every year for life\*\*\*. If the price of the stock goes down, pick some more up! the admission is cheaper now, for the same pay out.

\*\*\* MO is in a class called the Dividend Aristocrats (see the wikipedia link in the other post). MO has paid dividends for 25+ years without a miss, AND increased them every year!!!!! So your $3.36 will increase every year. maybe a penny, usually more. $KO (Coke) has paid and increased for 56 YEARS!!!!!

8 Year Dividend Change: 7.32%   
9 Year Dividend Change: 7.89%   
10Year Dividend Change: 11.76% 

here are MO's last 10 years of dividend increases!!! You can use that to kinda guess what they will do next year. its not guaranteed. Its showing that MO is increasing their rent payment to you! at least the dividend payments will beat out inflation!

Is MO's dividend sustainable?

Q4 2019, Earnings were $1.09 per share

MO pays out $0.84 cents per share, per quarter.

DividendPayOut Ratio = 84/109 = 77%  .. They say under 80% is good. Thats just back of the envelope calculations.

So for me at least, the last week has been a bloody garage sale! As prices dropped, the dividend yields go up! 

$XOM (Exxon Mobil) is also a Dividend Aristocrat - current 7.34% yields

$T (AT&T) also an Aristocrat, is pulling 6% (ATT doesn't increase dividends very well)

The annual growth in dividends is actually quite interesting.

$KO is pulling 3% dividend yields at buy in. Also an aristocrat, they will increase their dividends every year.. Well how many years before it hits 10%... based on their history, probably over 100 years.

There are other aristocrats that start at 1% dividend yields, but can reach 10% yields in about 10 years!!!!  10% dividend yields on an aristocrat!! well, thats quite nice! So the starting yield + the dividend rate of growth is very important in picking.

t3_ff2crm,fjv9m9o,"You're going to have to decide what is best for yourself, all anyone can give you is a list of what they like, though it might not fit what you want. 

That being said, some good general advice is to start your portfolio out with some dividend aristocrats or kings. You can Google a list of them, or there are also a million YouTube videos about them. Essentially it's a list of dividend paying companies considered safe because they have consistently paid out and increased their dividends for at least 25 years...some 50 years or longer (hence Kings.) Since they have paid out that long they are considered fairly safe beginner options. That and/or some dividend based ETF's are good places to start looking. 

My two biggest pieces of advice would be 1. Make sure you understand the company and what it does before investing. If you can't figure out what exactly they do from their little profile blurb you should probably not invest in it. 2. Understand this method will not make you rich in any short amount of time. Dividend investing is a long, slow process that gets faster the longer you stick with it...but if you start looking at too many ways to speed it up you might get sucked into some ""yield traps"" of failing companies that have a high dividend trying to keep investors while losing money.

t3_fezwz3,fju7hq6,"Im not familiar with the best way to do it in the States but for Canadian's I found the easiest way is to set up a TFSA and a self directed brokerage account with your bank. 

I'm with Scotia Bank so every 2 weeks when I'm paid I transfer cash to my TFSA and purchase banks and utilities mostly and set them up as DRIPs through Scotia iTrade. I typically wont bother buying a stock until I have at least $2500 cash available to cut back on trading fees.  

10 years from now assuming my TFSA portfolio maintains a 4% yield, annual capital growth of 5% and dividend increases of 8% (conservative numbers I think).  Also assuming I max out my TFSA in the next two years to my $75,000 contribution room and then max out with $500 monthly contribution from then forward. 

In 10 years of DRIPing I would have put in $123,000 in contributions and the account will be valued at $217,000 paying out and annual dividend of $8700 a year or $725 a month.

AKA If you can average a 4% yield you'll need $300,000 invested for a monthly payout of $1000 in dividends. 

But really the key is to keep DRIPing that portfolio and adding your monthly contributions so you can really reap the benefits. Using the same numbers as above in just 25 yrs the portfolio would be worth $2,400,000. ( If its in a tax sheltered account that is) 

This calculator is a really nice planning tool and makes you appreciate how much taxes SUCK!

> The Fund is a diversified closed-end fund. The primary investment objective is to seek high current income; capital appreciation is a secondary objective. The Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 65% of its total assets in income-generating equity securities, including dividend-paying common stocks, convertible securities, preferred stocks, and other equity-related securities, which may include up to 25% in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate industry operating companies. Up to 35% of the Fund's total assets may be invested in nonconvertible debt securities consisting primarily of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds. In addition, the Fund utilizes leveraging techniques in an attempt to obtain a higher return for the Fund. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. 

Personally, I wouldn’t recommend this fund. If you’re young then an income based fund shouldn’t be you’re primary goal. It also utilizes leveraging... this alone can backfire longterm. However, it all depends on your goals. I prefer a “set & forget” type of REIT like O or NNN.

t3_fhcz8a,fkarkt3,"MY thoughts with some additional equities:

MMM, ADP, JNJ, PG are very good right now. Incredibly boring but nice long term investments.

MMM is an absolute beast for profitability, yield and capital reinvestment. MorningStar FMV is $186 which represents almost 20% discount from yesterday’s close of $147 and pre market is showing another 3.5% drop. This is the one equity I own very few shares of but will be jumping on it in the next few days like a mob on electronics at Walmart during Black Friday. This is a fantastic deal going forward. I believe one of the best for buy/hold dividend reinvestment.

JNJ and PG are fairly valued right now. They aren’t my top picks but if they drop 10% over the next week, they may be a buy for me.

AFL and ABBV are also good picks. You need to watch AFL long term though due to changes in Japan over the next decade. ABBV is very good fundamentally, undervalued slightly with great ROI and capital reinvestment. The yield is very nice and sustainable.

DIS is undervalued by about $30. This is a great long term stock. With the move into Disney+, they will be printing money BUT it won’t happen for sometime. Disney Parks are a very large revenue generator (as is the cruise line) and you will see drastic shortfalls in the next 2-3 quarters. It’s going to be rough for them the next year. It’s Disney though. That Mouse is probably the most well known rodent in the world and will continue to appeal for years and years to come. DIS is down over 7% in after market trading at $98ish. I believe it hit its 52 week low yesterday of $102. I’d say it’s a buy at this level but it will probably drop a bit more, maybe even into the high 80s in the coming week.

T and VZ are always good. They are at a slight discount right now. You’ll see the dividend for many years. These are not growth stocks at all. In a year or so you will see the equity prices rise but don’t expect more than 2-4% gains per year. Dividend is very safe though.

INTC, PFE and CSCO are discounted pretty nicely right now. You have to watch INTC and CSCO due to their sector. You’ll see nice dividends for years on these but INTC and CSCO probably won’t see bull market gains again for sometime.

D, SO, ED are strong fairly valued regulated equities with 2-4% yearly revenue gains and very nice yields going forward. ED has been paying dividends for years and years. I like it due to their move into Solar electricity generation. They really aren’t discounted now but they are pretty much the most “guaranteed” dividend income generators out there due to their regulated nature. 

XOM. I’m on the fence on this one. Oil definitely is a dinosaur industry. It’s so freaking capital intensive and anything below $40 a barrel is starting to kill margins right now. If the barrel price stabilizes around $50 or goes above it, I think XOM is a decent deal for a 5 year hold. You’d have to revisit it after that though. The reason it might be good is due to China. They love oil and coal still and don’t care about using either resource. I hold XOM but it’s definitely more risky, so do your research on this one.

Not great for the next year or maybe 2 years if we do get into a full blown bear market is JPM and WFC. Dividends are safe on these and they are both discounted. These will eek out market increases over the next few years in a bear market but, these are definitely buy and hold for the next decade if you can get them for a decent price. Only issue with JPM is if Dimon dies or leaves the company. That guy is a freaking rockstar and his departure will hit the stock for quite sometime. I just don’t like BAC btw. I won’t own it. The company’s past leaves little desire for me to hold it but that’s just me.

If you want to have a great yield for the next few years but also want to see your equity drop 20-30%, look into MO. It’s currently undervalued. You’d have to be able to stomach the fundamentals though. For me, I’d love to chase the yield on this but don’t think it’s a great long term value even at its current level. You have to be comfortable with their business and balance sheet if you wanted to invest. China and Europe still love to smoke so...I dunno on this one.

Last but not least is APPL. Yes, it’s a growth/tech stock with a large supply network in China and its overvalued atm, but the fundamentals are there and are freaking fantastic. FMV is about $238-240. If it were to drop to or below that, it would be a buy even in a bear market. Long term, that’s a great company and even though the yield is low, you have small yield increases, large share buybacks and the largest cash hoard in the world.  The share buybacks are MASSIVE for the shareholders.

Out of all of these, I’ll be scrambling for MMM and really looking at DIS and APPL at the right prices.

Edit - Today and tomorrow will be an absolute bloodbath in the markets. Anticipate the DOW hitting 21700 or below by Friday. If it hits those levels, next week might see another 5-10% decline. I wouldn’t move until I see these levels.

Also, I’m a long term buy and hold investor. Short term drops don’t rattle me much, my stock picks reflect 7-10 year horizons. Do your own research and identify your own risk before making buys.

Here is the link to the MEMOS to EMPLOYEES

It has been an extraordinary few weeks, to say the least, for our business, our nation and our world. Just over a month ago we were celebrating a record Profit-Sharing Day; today we face the greatest economic challenge in our history as the world grapples with the growing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

I want to thank the more than 13,000 people who have stepped up to take voluntary unpaid leaves – this is the most important thing anyone can do right now to support Delta. While I’m grateful to the thousands that have volunteered, we could use more, so please seriously consider whether this is the right short-term decision for you and your family.

Earlier this week I outlined the serious threat to our business and the difficult actions we’re taking over the next few months to protect our company. Our revenue outlook continues to deteriorate in the short term with the decline in travel demand. We’re now projecting our June quarter revenues will be down by $10 billion compared to a year ago – an 80 percent reduction. It’s also clear, given the underlying damage the virus has created to the overall economy, that demand recovery will take an extended period once the virus is contained.

In light of the unprecedented challenges facing us, we have entered into a $2.6 billion secured credit facility and are drawing down $3 billion under our existing revolving credit facilities. This will help fortify our cash position in the coming weeks and months. To put this in context, despite all the self-help measures we are taking, we are currently burning roughly $50 million in cash each day.

We also continue working with the President and Congress on disaster relief assistance, which is vital to protect our industry’s critical role in our nation’s economy. Amid those discussions, in recent days some critics have argued that the airlines have not been good stewards of our money during our profitable years. At Delta, nothing could be further from the truth. Our philosophy has always been a simple one: We put 50 percent of our operating cash flow back into our business by investing in our people and our customers, use 30 percent to pay down debt, and return 20 percent to our owners.

In fact, over the past five years Delta has invested over $20 billion in new aircraft, airport enhancements, technology and customer service improvements; and invested $19 billion in our people via profit-sharing and pension contributions and payments. In addition, we increased base pay by 30 percent during that period and regained the confidence of the financial markets by earning back our investment-grade credit rating. When the extent of the COVID-19 crisis became clear, we immediately suspended our share repurchases, and our **Board of Directors has voted to suspend future dividend payments.**

While these actions will help, the innovation of our people has always been our most powerful tool, and we need it more than ever to protect the future of our company. I have received a remarkable number of ideas and offers to help from Delta people across all divisions as well as our merit employees. We’re reviewing them all and will be making decisions soon on next steps to preserve cash, fortify our future and plan for our eventual recovery. We are exploring all options on help we will need from both merit and frontline people.",3,1584752851.0

t3_fm97q9,fl5qcgs,"You’ve got some good ideas for ETFs and I like those for easy diversification. If you really want to pick individual stocks I recommend finding stocks that you can see clear value in from your own perspective with some dividend history. For example, I love DIS. Note that I do think it will fall further from the $90’s due to short term global economic slowness and COVID related park closures and travel bans, but long term DIS is a clear winner IMHO. It has amazing brand recognition and with a stream service that will surely bring reoccurring subscription income + plenty of room to increase subscription fees they are going to do well over the next decade.

I also like XOM although the world is starting to drift towards less oil dependence for ground transportation there are still many large countries and industries that rely on oil heavily.  This is another case where short term oil industry is under immense pressure due to travel bans, shelter in place restrictions, and the Saudi price war, but long term I see the oil industry going through another round of consolidation and the price of oil will eventually stabilize much higher than where it is today.

I don’t like the automotive industry right now. I suspect many manufacturers are going to get hit very hard over the next 12-18 months as the global economy spins down.  There may not be bailouts this time around for American car makers.

I like airlines, specifically Delta, which are likely to receive some form of a bailout in the near future.  I pick Delta because I fly them often and though flying today is remarkably much less enjoyable than it was 20-30 years ago I think Delta is doing the best of the US airlines right now.

t3_fonc3l,flj3vhq,"First this has nothing to do with banks running out of cash, so far banks have been very liquid.

The issue with mREITS is due to their business model. REITS in general use a lot of leverage, however mREITS are unique because they buy mortgage backed securities instead of the underlying real estate directly. In addition, they borrow large sums from banks and other investors to generate higher returns. This is how MBS yielding 2-3% can be turned into a mREIT yielding 5-6%. 

mREITS obtain leverage via repos - so the mREIT buys the MBS and borrows the cash via repo from a bank or asset manager, pledging the MBS as collateral for the loan. For example, a bank may lend $100 of cash against $140 of MBS, maintaining the $40 difference as margin, or protection against default.

Next you have coronavirus causing businesses to shut down, cash flows to businesses stop, and therefore businesses have trouble paying their rent. Well those MBS that own commercial real estate where renters aren’t paying rent are now worth a lot less. In the example above say the MBS price falls to $120, to maintain $40 of margin against the original $100 cash loan from the bank the mREIT has the generate $20 of cash to pledge to the bank. 

Now on top of this you have investors in mREITS selling because they want to get out of a falling investment and convert their shares to cash. To meet that redemption the mREIT has to sell the underlying MBS to raise cash and payback the investor. Now mREITS are dumping MBS in the market to meet redemptions, causing the prices of MBS to fall further, and now that MBS is worth $100 and the bank is asking for another $20.

In this situation the mREIT is running out of liquidity, it’s borrowers are asking for more cash or margin to secure their loans, their assets are falling in price and no one wants to buy them, and their investors want their money back. Therefore, the mREIT has large obligations to provide cash to investors and borrowers but few assets available to sell. 

There is also the issue of market liquidity, there are not enough buyers for every seller, so that pushes prices further down. Given the uncertainty the virus has created, investors don’t want to take risk, and companies need to raise cash. 

Hope this helps, happy to answer any questions.",3,1585198116.0

t3_g6xaag,fodnz5q,"Try playing around with some dividend growth calculators such as this one:

https://www.dividendladder.com/tools/dividend-calculator/

The conclusion I’ve come to is that dividend investing rewards patience. With a good conservative diversified portfolio and $500 per month, you can eventually create a very healthy income stream. But the catch is you’ll have to reinvest those dividends for 20+ years before it really takes off. If you want an instant boost to your monthly income, you’ll need a massive amount of up front capital as you rightly noted in your question.

I think that’s why so many of the young and impatient turn to real estate. By borrowing money they can get an income stream from a $400k asset flowing for 20% of the up front cost. However that leverage (borrowing) comes with its own risks. Every time there is a housing crash ( or a pandemic!) or whatever it is, many of these ambitious investors lose everything because they lose tenants and can’t pay the mortgages from the millions of dollars worth of property they are renting out. Then again plenty of stock investors use leverage and go broke too so I’m not saying real estate is bad or anything. Just that you have to understand that anything that has a juicy and immediate looking payout probably has the ability to quickly ruin your life (shout out to Wall Street Bets).

If you are really interested mREIT maybe it is preferable to buy a basket ETF like REM.

Or find out which in REM are the ""strongest"", are not cutting 100% their dividend.

If you are thinking of creating an ""income factory"" then at least make sure that Total Return performance (gain + dividend) is as good as SPY average 10% performance (2% dividend + 8% gain) more or less. SPY is expected to no return this much for the next decades, but even if discounted at 7%-8% total return per year it is not bad.

Otherwise, why bother? 

Let's say today you are retired and you have $1,000,000 in SPY with an average total return of 8% in the future years. And you do not re-invest the dividends.

So your $1,000,000 has become $1,060,000.

It should generates 2% dividend ($20,000) and $60,000 gain, but if you need $50,000 a year to live, you could sell $30,000 of SPY.

You are left with $1,030,000, that will generate $20,600 dividend, and $61,800 gain. etc...

This simple scenario, where the market goes up, it does not include income tax nor capital gain tax, it does not include effect of inflation on your income needs.

Capital gain tax is usually less than income tax. There are different tax rate for different thresholds for income tax and capital gain tax, in different countries.

You need to work them out to see what is most advantageous to you.

Dividend investing is great but not at the detriment of total return.

In addition, fidelity has fractional shares already for you to use. I did try M1 finance as well, but I was never into it for too long their problem is specifically their support problems just like robinhood. The other thing about M1 is apparently a lot of people had problems with tax forms not having correct information on them.

# Timing the market: The absolute worst vs absolute best vs slow and steady

📷

Here's this same info as a visual journey for those visual learners: [https://imgur.com/gallery/BlK4jzM](https://imgur.com/gallery/BlK4jzM)

&#x200B;

I downloaded the historic S&P 500 data going back 40 years. I dumped everything in Google Sheets and modeled the three different portfolios, named after three fictional friends Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah. All three saved $200 of their income per month for 40 years for a total of $96,000 each. But after 40 years they all ended up with different amounts based on their investment strategies.

Tiffany's Terrible Timing

Tiffany is the world's worst market timing. She saves $200/month in a savings account getting 3% interest until the worst possible times. She started by saving for 8 years only to put her money in at the absolute market peak in 1987, right before Black Monday and the resulting 33% crash. But she never sold, and instead started saving her cash again, only to do the same at the next three market peaks. Each time she invested the full amount of her saved cash only to watch the market crash immediately after. Most recently she put all her money in the day before the 2007 financial crisis. She’s been saving cash ever since waiting for the next market peak.

With this perfectly bad market timing, Tiffany still didn’t do too bad. Her $96,000 she saved and invested over the last 40 years is now worth **$663,594**. Even though she invested only at each market peak, her big nest egg is thanks to the power of buying and holding. Since she never sold, her investment always recovered and flourished as the market inevitably recovered far surpassing her original entry points.

Brittany Buys at the Bottom

Brittany, in stark contrast to Tiffany, was omniscient. She also saved her money in a savings account earning 3% interest, but she correctly predicted the exact bottom of each of the four crashes and invested all of her saved cash on those days. Once invested, she also held her index fund while saving up for the next market crash. It can’t be overstated, how hard it is to predict the bottom of a market. In 1990 with war breaking out in the Middle East, Brittany decided to dump all her cash in when the market was only down 19%. But in 2007, the market dropped 19% and she didn’t jump in until it fell all the way down to a 56% drop, again perfectly predicting the exact moment it had no further to fall and dumped in all of her cash just in time for the recovery.

For this impossibly perfect market timing, Brittany Bottom was rewarded. Her $96,000 of savings has grown to **$956,838** today. It’s certainly an improvement, but interesting to note that when comparing the absolute worst market timing versus the absolute best, the difference is only a 44% gain. Both Brittany and Tiffany have the vast majority of their growth thanks to buying and holding a low cost index fund.

Slow and Steady Sarah

Sarah was different from her friends. She didn’t try to time market peaks or valleys. She didn’t watch stock prices or listen to doomsday predictions. In fact, she only did one thing. On the day she opened her account in 1979, she set up a $200 per month auto investment in an S&P 500 index fund. Then she never looked at her account again.

Each month her account would automatically invest $200 more in her index fund at whatever the current price happened to be. She invested at every market peak and every market bottom. She invested the first month and the last month and every month in between. But her money never sat in a savings account earning 3% interest.

When Sarah Steady was ready to retire, she signed up for online access to her account (since the internet had been invented since she last looked at it). She was pleasantly surprised with what she found. Her slow and steady approach had grown her nest egg to **$1,386,429**. Even though she didn’t have Brittany’s impossibly perfect ability to know the bottom of the market, Sarah’s investment crushed Brittany’s by more than $400,000.

Recap

* Amount Saved/Invested: $96,000 each
* Investment: Buy and hold an S&P 500 index fund
* Tiffany (worst timing in the world): $663,594
* Brittany (best timing in the world): $956,838
* Sarah (auto invests monthly): $1,386,429

So if you’re worried the market is too high and we’re due for a crash. Or you want to wait for the inevitable drop before you put your money in. Think about whether you’re so good at predicting the market you can do it better than Brittany who knew when to invest down to the exact day. And even if you are that good, realize that it’s still a losing strategy to the early and often approach that Sarah executed so flawlessly.

I'd definitely recommend making an account on TDA (whether you want to invest there or not. I personally don't) and use their educational courses. It'll teach you what stuff means and how to use that information on a very basic level. 

Once you kind of have a firm grip on what everything is and what it's used for I've recently gotten into one of TDA's youtube channels. They have their educational coaches give ~30 minute presentations on how to actually take what you know and apply it to finding stocks and determining investments.

As of today, its about a 5% dividend yield.

At the lows of the 2008 recession 2009-03-30, their dividend yield went as high as 9.9%! So maybe they have some room to drop.

Here is their top 10 tenants from Wikipedia.

|Rank|Tenant|% of 2019 Revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Walgreens|6.1%|
|2|7-Eleven|4.8%|
|3|Dollar General|4.4%|
|4|FedEx|4.0%|
|5|Dollar Tree/Family Dollar|3.5%|
|6|LA Fitness|3.4%|
|7|AMC Theatres|3.0%|
|8|Regal Cinemas|2.9%|
|8|Walmart/Sam's Club|2.6%|
|10|Sainsbury's|2.4%|

The chart above only shows 37% of their income. 63% is not accounted for. 

LA Fitness and AMC seem to be their worst tenants now (6.4% of revenue), with social distancing. They seem to like their ""dollar stores"", which should do well during a recession when money is tight.

I don't know the details of each and every lease, but they seem to enjoy NNN leases. Which means the tenant pays all taxes, maintenance ,etc on the properties. Which is good for $O!

t3_gbzkm8,fp9qtc5,"I actually wondered the same thing.  Quite frankly, I'm in a similar boat.  I currently have 20 stocks in my portfolio with a portfolio balance of $1200.  The only reason I did 20 stocks was because I pretty much had that before when my portfolio was larger, and I had to liquidate the portfolio to help fund the down payment for a condo.  Since I had already done the research to select the stocks, I didn't want to start over from the beginning.

Had I been starting from scratch, I would likely have chosen maybe 3-5 stocks to concentrate on.  But even then, I'm not sure, because then I would have agonized over at what point to then add the next stock, and then the next.  Perhaps having a goal of $2000 in each stock before adding another might make some sense.

The brokerage you use might impact your decision making as well.  I use M1 Finance and so they practice dynamic balancing which makes it hard to concentrate your investments into one stock if you're trying to go with the automatic and lazy approach to investing like I am.

In the end, I don't think it matters much.  The shares in your portfolio in each individual stock won't grow as fast as if you had concentrated them in fewer stocks, but you are also more diversified.  Given our current environment, diversification seem to make more sense than concentration of all your money into 1-3 stocks.

so, these are things to consider, depending in YOUR tax bracket. When you retire, you may not be working, and you could be in a low tax bracket, thus taxed low or zero.

You are correct with the Tax Advantaged accounts, like IRA's. 

In general, first invest in your tax advantaged accounts, then your taxable account.

Some people keep all their REITs and MLP's in tax advantaged accounts, since they are generally taxed as ORDINARY income (which is at ""paycheck"" tax rates). Then they use their taxable accounts to hold all their QUALIFIED dividend stocks.

In a taxable account, which is better? a REIT paying 7% dividends, or a qualified stock paying 5%? That depends on your tax bracket.

Quality company over yield. Always. When I see a fat dividend I used to get excited. ""Oh wow I could get 1k a year with my 10k investment."" Then a year passes and I got the 1k in dividends, but lost 2k in the stock price. Example: PSEC. Even before covid hit...



 I do my own analysis on each stock and what I would be comfortable with paying for that business. I'm talking about reviewing their 10k reports. Listen to earnings calls. Understand the business and it's challenges, competitors. Then I check the market cap. I choose the best priced business out of the 10 and buy it.

t3_gf9st1,fps9w6s,"Personally, I think dividend investing is for when you already have a large sum of money to be invested. If your goal is to grow your money by having the largest return every year then a growth fund is probably your best bet. Once you get to the point where you have a lot of money, then you can start putting it in value funds for the dividends and there will actually be a noticeable amount rather than a few dollars per month. 
I recommend growth funds until you get older and closer to retirement. Once you’re in retirement, your portfolio should be majority large-value (dividend) funds. That’ll give you actual income rather than a few dollars per month and it’ll be much much more since you have more cash to invest due to the higher return of growth-funds.

Edit: if you want the best of both worlds right now, then I’d recommend picking 2 funds. One that’s large-growth and one that’s large-blend. I’d still recommend putting the majority of your money into the growth fund right now though if you want to earn as much money as possible. 

And just to put things into perspective. The large growth fund SPYG’s ten year trailing return is 13.74%. The large value fund SPYV’s ten year trailing return is 9%. The large blend fund SPY’s ten year trailing return is 11.59%",11,1588869910.0

In 2009, its low went to $14.  In 2020, corona March, its low was $60. Its currently back up to $89 (why, i have no idea).

If you're an income investor focusing on passive income from dividends, then the general day-to-day volatility associated with the stock market shouldn't phase you too much. As long as the overall financials and management of your chosen companies continues to stay healthy then you should be fine.

Of course if a company starts to under perform and has the potential for a long term downward trend then this is something that should be reviewed and if necessary, an equity sold off, sometimes a capital loss.

The trick with passive income investing is dividend reinvestment, which along with larger capital deposits, should compound overtime to create a large portfolio with a good monthly income.

It's unavoidable to become uneasy at seeing the price of a stock fall when you've got hard earned money invested in it, but keeping a cool head and reviewing a company regularly should allow you to make logical and calculated decisions, which would hopefully benefit you.",3,1589216414.0
t3_ghr6z5,fqbdgup,"It can be a useful part of a portfolio.  Especially when long term dividends are fifteen percent taxed, which is nice and low.

There have been studies that showed DRIP can be more lucrative than just holding stocks (or at least competitive), and some investors like getting paid cash instead of reinvesting everything back in company shares.  Some argue you can behave like a dividend by selling small numbers of shares regularly as a payout.  But really I think that’s theory as I bet only a few human beings actually do it, especially if it costs them a fee each time to sell some shares.

I think it’s more about young v. old.  Young people like growth so they reinvest, old people like income so they pull out more, dividends being an easy way to automatically do it.",4,1589234965.0
t3_ghr6z5,fqacbo8,"Yes, but generally (in this style of investing) you are not selling the stocks right away.  It doesn't matter what the stock price is except for one or two days: the day you buy the company and maybe the day you sell out of the company.

Stock A buy at $X no dividends -----> sell years later at $2X

Stock B buy at $X with dividends -----> sell years later at $2X-d (minus the dividends you recieved)

Both returns are the same (taxes may be taken differently)

The company (and stock) will hopefully increase in value just like any other growth stock. The major difference here between only growth stocks and dividend is that you recieve the payment durring the period of holding it. This separates it from the value others put on it.

There is a lot riding on the price of stock A vs stock B's holder can make money simply by holding it if the price drops.

The stock price is what others will pay for it, so right now prices dropped because people need cash or are fearfull or etc. But the company itself may be fine (ex. Home Depot is not really effected by the virus as it is considered an essensial buisness and most of its supply is still coming).  If you hold HD you still recieve the same dividend regardless of the value of the stock.

The other benifit is you don't have to sell to make a profit. In this way it is comparable to renting properties vs flipping them.  Both are good investment strategies. One you buy the property and hold it to consistantly recieve rent payments. The other you buy and increase (grow) the value by doing repairs and sell it at a higher price. Different styles for different situations.",3,1589216631.0

t3_ghr6z5,fqbwt3a,"Plenty of comments here already pretty much already said it, but stock price doesn't truly ""drop"" on ex-div day. Even if it does, you don't hold div stocks to just sell the day after ex-div day....the investment evens itself out within a day or so if it drops. Most of mine only drop within the same dollar range they were already in. This doesn't change their profitability in the long run. 

For the rest of your question, it's profitable as a means of true net gain that you get without having to sell your investment. If you only buy growth stocks, you're buying and holding, hoping that when it comes time for you to sell that it will be profitable. With a div stock, you're earning money from holding it without selling it to get that money. As long as the company remains profitable, you will continue to earn that money as long as you hold the shares. Hell, if you die and Will your stocks to someone else, they can continue to collect your div payments. 

On top of that, that div money is money paid to you for an investment you made previously....which makes it compound interest on your money. You can do whatever you want with that div money, but if you continually re-invest it, it's like having companies pay you to buy more div-paying stocks. I've not been investing a full year yet, but I contribute about $400 a month to my portfolio. At this point, I earn $449 a year in dividends, which means in less than a year I have given myself an extra month of income invested that didn't come from my own wallet. At this rate I can likely up my yearly dividends $500 a year and in about 6-8 years time I could be looking at $500 a month in dividends, which will all be re-invested along with my own money, continually growing and expanding. 

I'd say any form of money growth that gives you a ten year span or less from starting your first investment to essentially earning you the same amount you were putting in every month when you started as profitable. It's all about the long term.",3,1589245477.0

Yes, not getting qualified dividends using this method (assuming individual stocks) and you have to consider that not all stocks bounce back immediately.   You could have capital tied up for a day or so waiting for the stock to go back to a break even price, where you get just the dividend as profit.   If you're good with these, then nothing wrong with the approach, just means more hit on the tax front at end of year (assuming it is a tax-able account) .v. holding shares and eventually getting qualified dividends.

t3_giewsj,fqe8r8u,"You’re getting to the heart of the total value investing vs dividend investing debate. Here is the main benefit I can see:

If your goal is to create cash flow from your investments, you can actually benefit from stagnant or decreasing share price, assuming the company is a massive industry powerhouse that is not going to go broke any time soon ( think MO and utilities etc). Dividend income is based on number of shares owned. If you reinvest your dividends in a flat or decreasing stock, your dividend dollars buy an increasing amount of shares (assuming the dividend remains constant).  If the company still increases its dividend yearly, this makes the increase in shares even more dramatic. So while you’re total portfolio value decreases, your current income compounds. 

Many will argue that this is short sighted, and they have a very valid point. But sometimes this suits the goals of the investor. But of course, if the dividend is cut you are left with a loss in the end. So choose companies wisely.",8,1589303593.0

These companies used to have yields half of what they have right now. Both WBA & MO are great companies and would of been an amazing investment if you bought when they first started paying dividends.

See, any of us can buy KO right now, but we'll never get the kind of yield Warren gets, and it's simple math as to why.  Dividend yield is the annual payout amount divided by the stock price that you paid for that share.

Warren's average cost per share of KO?  Dunno, but I sure as shit bet it's well below the 40'ish dollars a share costs right now.  Let's say he paid half that amount, $20/share.  KO common stock is paying $1.64 annual, divide that by $20 and you get a yield of 8.2%.  With that kind of yield, you don't need that much growth each year in order to keep up with the average S&P 500 returns.

Problem is, investing in a stock that yields 8% or higher is super risky.  You have to find a company that is paying about half that yield right now and invest a boatload of money into it so DRIP can work its magic, then hope that the company continues to remain solvent for decades and increase its dividend payout at least enough to sustain it and grow it a bit to account for inflation...all while at least doubling the price of the stock compared to your cost basis.

I look for set it and forget it type stocks that can give me consistent dividends to build an ever growing passive income portfolio. I’m reading up on analyzing company financials and what makes the most sense to me in any long term type investment is to go for companies with a long term competitive advantage. Think Coke, McDonald’s, Johnson and Johnson, 3M, Walmart. Now their attractiveness can certainly be called in question but these are companies with a long dividend paying history, with very strong financials. Other very strong companies with strong dividends include Microsoft and Apple. I wouldn’t ever invest in Ford.

If you’re looking to diversify I’d say to look at some of the companies I mentioned that can present a strong source of passive income, albeit with a lot less growth potential than some other companies. It all depends on what you want from your dividend portfolio and what your age+long term strategy is. I haven’t looked into the companies you mentioned, but I would look to diversify to some of the sorts of companies that you can trust a little more, with more history. Schwab allows fractional ownership so definitely reinvest those dividends.

Making the first 100, then 500, then 1,000/yr is super exciting and it will hook you;  it opens up a world of possibilities and the thought of having the FI part of FIRE is something that can help drive you.   I figure once I hit the milestone after 25K/yr, I'll slow down,stop living so spartan and let it hit the final goal over time.   That being said, I like your idea of looking for value, but don't always see cheap as undervalued.   Sometimes circumstances change enough that it goes down a good bit in value and can even seem expensive.   Also, never let a good crash go to waste, if you have margin available :)  Fear driven markets w/ unreasonable sell-offs are great buying opportunities and most importantly, do not beat yourself up about missing the bottom or top in a buy/sell.

Link to the graph above, so you can see this anomaly! :)

Last Price = $14.02 as of May 17, 2020.

Last dividend check per share is $0.107.. its lowest ever. It fluctuates every month.

Its a Monthly dividend payer! 

Annual Dividend Payout = $0.107 x 12 = $1.284 a year.

Annual Dividend Yield = $1.284 / $14.02 = 9.15%

2013-04-01 $25.67

2014-04-01 $27.11

2015-04-01 $28.27

2016-04-01 $24.72

2017-04-01 $25.03

2018-04-04 $24.13

2019-04-03 $23.77

Pretty steady..so don't think you will get rich on its stock price. 

The dividend growth :

if you bought in 2013-04-01..for $25.67 a share.. it paid a dividend of $0.15.. so that's a Dividend Yield of 6.72%.  

Although the dividend payout has fluctuated.. on 2020-02-05, it was $0.157.. so about the same as when you bought it..    if you assume the dividend was flat for the last 7 years..you made approx 6.72% a year.. but it wasn't flat..

so from a quick look.. the stock price seems sorta steady.. the dividend seemed fairly steady (before Corona).. its monthly...

Lets Dollar Cost Average from its birth in 2013.

Stock\_RETURN + DIV\_RETURN = TOTAL\_RETURN

92.53% + 23.34% = 115.87%

If you sold everything on JAN 27, 2020 (BEFORE CORONA).. you lost 7.5% in stock value. But received 23.34% in dividend returns. So you are up 15.87% after 7 years of DCAing into this.

Is this good? dunno.. lets have a race..

its 2013.. you buy $DIV,, and i buy $KO (Coke),, on JAN 27,2020.. we sell it all..who has more pennies in his pocket.

$KO

STOCK\_RETURN + DIV\_RETURN = TOTAL\_RETURN

131.68% + 11.913% = 143.61%

$KO's stock appreciated more than $DIV.. and $KO's total return is way more than $DIV... but $DIV paid out more in dividends.. almost double. 

yea..thats probably not a very good comparison (im just making up this post as i go along) 

Lets compare $DIV with $SPHD and $SCHD!!

SPHD and SCHD under the same time frame (2013 to 2020,JAN)

$SCHD 136.39% + 11.61% = 148.02%

$SPHD 120.67% + 15.091% = 135.78%

hum.. $DIV still paid out more in dividends..

if you are buying $DIV to HOLD FOREVER..(because the stock price appreciation STINKS)...and you believe that the economy will go back to the last decade, and $DIV will go back to paying an average of $0.15 a dividend.. and you need fat checks to pay your expenses (but not in bear markets), then maybe think about it.

The real downside is the management fee of 1%. That's high for an ETF where most are 0,6% or lower. You can buy most of these stocks for 0% + whatever commission your broker has instead of 1% at all times. The ones you may or may not have a harder time getting are the 27% of the portfolio that is in countries other than the US and Canada. 12,79% is from China which is somewhat more risky not only because of the CCP's usual doings but also because Trump is reviving the feud with them lately.

Dist are solid, and the December bonus was REALLY nice:  Raised normal monthly from .15 to .1655 and paid out some LT cap gains (1.68/share) but mostly the monthly raise :)    Yes the China exposure can be a bit concerning, but I am not overly concerned with 12% being allocated there.   If you wanted to reduce US and China exposure, they started another CEF called BSTZ.   However, it has higher management fees and it is a limited time CEF, it goes out June 2031.  Since it has just started, not really a proven track record just yet.   
  
I guess the big negative you can look at BST with is that it is a young fund, established 2014.

I take 10% of every paycheck and throw it into a pile, ~70% goes to dividend stocks, ~20% goes to speculative growth stuff like SNAP or BYND, ~10% of it goes to gambling on earnings with options like a degenerate. 

Never withdrawal from your portfolio unless an emergency. Keep the gambling in a separate portfolio....",2,1590117117.0

I used to own PSEC from 2014 - 2018. With all dividends reinvested it netted me a 0.93% CAGR. If I had still owned PSEC today, my CAGR would be -2.84% with dividends reinvested. You end up losing money in the long run.

Now, I'm just using PSEC because I had that same mentality and I actually owned PSEC thinking as long as I'm getting that dividend, who cares about share price? But something always changes, like a dividend cut in 2017 and the share price plummeting since then.

This is not the case for really strong companies like JNJ, KO, MCD, PEP, HD, etc. But these yields are at ~3% which is considered relatively low. You would need ~$400k to generate an average $1k/month in dividend income from these dividend growth stocks.

There are some cases where the short-term price is static and the dividend unchanged, but they generally don't offer high enough yields to warrant chasing those short-term benefits. Since you can't predict the future, it's best to avoid thinking like this and invest is strong dividend-paying companies instead.

You should be trying to take advantage of as many fractional shares as possible, but as I found out today sometimes you just can't. For those times, it would just be a matter of looking at what my goals are and planning around it for the investment. Why would it be important to buy one sooner than the others?

I would highly doubt there is any stats saying you could be better invested if you bought in at a certain time of the month. Different companies announce earnings at different times, some only really report big news on the Quarter....the economy could tank/recover at any time. Sometimes it dips in the middle of a week and recovers two days late. Some times it rises on a Friday and sinks on the following Monday and vice-versa.   


Your questions seem a little silly just because they seem misguided for what kind of investing this is. Unless you have a ton of upfront capital to invest, dividends are a long-term game. It has been statistically proven that the people who make the most money in the stock market are people who just put in a routine, regular amount of money every month, regardless of what is actually happening in the market.

However, IF (and that’s a big if) the dividend is not cut, your dividend income benefits from a flat or declining share price since every reinvested dividend buys you more shares per dollar value. Next dividend your payout is bigger, and this bigger payout buys you even more shares per dollar. 

Compare this to an increasing share price, where your reinvested dividends increase your share count slower and slower each time until the dividend is (hopefully) increased. Overall you might have more money in your portfolio after 10 years, but the decreasing share price portfolio would reach a target dividend income amount sooner. 

That is all in theory though. I’m practice, a steadily declining company will eventually either cut their dividends or fix whatever issue is driving them down.

As others have mentioned, there’s a few upcoming events that will provide more insight into the state of our economy. 

We can be optimistic and think that everything is going to be back to normal when the country opens up, but think of how many small businesses and even big business that have filed for bankruptcy or just closed for good. A portion of the population won’t even have a job to go back to, and the unemployment insurance will be running out in some states soon. So what is one to do? 

Even if everything opens up tomorrow, will revenue be the same? Will people be more cautious and not spend as much in different industries? Let’s look at restaurants, stores, hotels etc that were barely making it during “very positive” economy “best ever”. What happens if only 90% of revenue starts coming? What about 80%? Will these business make it? 

Best case scenario, some business will still fail and many people will be unemployed. Economic growth will slow since it wasn’t just the U.S. that got hit but other countries as well. 

That’s the economy. Regarding the market? Who knows. That thing isn’t making sense.

t3_grktsu,frzg56h,"I'm new to dividends, and investing for that matter, but I do believe that there is another big crash coming.  I'm betting that we're in for another recession, and we're just in a gov propped dead cat bounce.  It's just hard to believe that the economy is at it's core still good, and that people aren't going to have to dip into their 401s to survive not having a job (huge unemployment).

The 2000 and 2008 crash took a long time to hit the bottom after they started. In 2000, the DOW peak was 11,722.98 on 1/10/2000.  It took 2.5 years to hit the bed at 7,528 on 9/30/2002 (a 35.8% drop). 2008 hit harder and faster, going from 14,093.08 on 10/7/2007 to 6,626.94 on 3/1/2009 (a 53.0% drop in 1.5 years).  

No one has a crystal ball, right? But if history has anything to teach us, it's that these things are semi-predictable.  I think the increase in technology makes everything move faster (more dramatic and quick swings), since information travels faster and people are more mobile with their money. However, at the end of the day, if 78% of workers are living paycheck to paycheck, that can't be super stable.

Yes it has it effects but it wasn’t a tech bubble or a housing bubble. It will change the way people live and interact for a while. Maybe push for more technology. I believe it will come back as people are released to go back to work. The only way it crashes again is if the country has to shut down again. Be on the lookout for that but verify what you see in the news. Places reopen and they have reports of increased cases in a few days?

My personal opinion is that our economy will continue as usual and keep being bullish once the corona virus news dies down because this recession is caused by an outside force rather than something our system itself caused.

It definitely highlighted some key issues with our economy that will need to be fixed or else a recession caused by our system will happen.

Because of the 20k ISA limit you may have an additional trading account

3. If your brokerage allows for fractional shares, then it should automatically purchase the corresponding percentage that you received.

I hope that this was helpful to you! =)",6,1591037254.0
t3_guoaj6,fsl6mzs,"It will work through fractional shares & the concept of compound interest. Because, especially with major companies, you will still receive dividends off of fractional shares. So, even if you have a .5 share of KO, you would still receive a dividend of .20-ish. Obviously you would purchase more in time, but the hope is that you will own enough shares for the DRIP to buy you more shares in time.

So, as an example, for the KO dividend to buy one share for ""free"", you would need to own around 112 shares (if the price is $46). Obviously this takes a lot of time and finances, but is well worth it if you are a buy and hold investor. This is why stocks like T, OKE, etc. are popular is that it doesn't take too many shares to make the drips earn more shares on themselves. T, for example, only needs about 60 shares for you to ""receive"" a free share off of the DRIP off of dividends earned. This is the strategy I'm hoping to do with KO, T, ET, etc. that it'll just keep buying shares and I won't have to spend any more money investing in the company, and can focus my investments on different companies.

tl;dr: Compound DRIPs will help you earn more dividends in time even on fractional shares. Expensive, but you can get into a cycle where the dividends basically buy you more shares of that company.

Hope it helps! Good luck!",3,1591060836.0

“You don’t diversify to get rich. You diversify to stay rich.” You’re young. You have all the time in the world to make money.

10 or less. I would even suggest 5.

The real money is in the understanding of balance sheets and understand what the future needs. 

Find a cheap IPO that’s getting started. Invest time into studying them and what their goals are. 

You don’t get rich owning everything. Name a guy that actually runs 20-30 business NADA

2. Don’t ever exit the market completely no matter how much you think you know. Max cash position 25%. The biggest risk is being underinvested.

t3_gvfb8y,fsoglo6,"This is my psychology and mindset:

I mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses.

Since I intend on holding forever, I must choose well established HIGH-QUALITY BLUE-CHIP DIVIDEND PAYING companies with wide economic moats because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (if not more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity.

People often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid. This will be the responsibility of my future children and my future grandchildren.

Finally, it is often said that the first $1,000,000 is the most difficult to secure. Going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 is easier. But, the easiest is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. My overall intent is to be the guy who fucking sets it all up, educates the next generation, and secure generational wealth for my last name. #thuglifeinvesting #thuglifepersonalfinance",35,1591133487.0
t3_gvfb8y,fsq1je0,"Unless you have a lot of capital up front, large dividends are a long-term destination. What will keep you going every month is adding bit by bit to your future empire. The amount of work that you're doing now to try and cut corners can help you in some ways, but it's going to hurt you in others.   


It sounds like you're going through manic stages thinking about how rich you could be if you bet on just the right horse. I've been there, it's maddening. The truth is that you could....but you almost definitely won't. An investor who invests with their emotions is a bad investor, because the same feeling you get when you buy these high risk stocks will turn into a feeling of panic whenever they do poorly.   


I make less than 30k in a year and in 9 months have saved roughly half my income for investing. My initial investment was about $500 from my savings account, plus $400 from my next paycheck. Every month after that I have put in around $500-600 from my paychecks, plus my tax return $600, plus the majority of the stimulus check since I have a job. I started with $700 and with regular, boring ass monthly contributions, plus re-investing all earned dividends, I have amassed a portfolio currently worth $7,946, which is only a little over $500 below where it was pre-pandemic. Barring any more dividend cuts, this nets me over $400 in dividends this year, which will likely hit $500 before the year's end, and this is with a pretty damn safe portfolio.  


Is that $500 in dividends this year going to take me to financial bliss? No. But that $500 this year will be like getting an entire extra month's worth of money to invest in, for free. Next year, I will start the year with that extra $500 coming down the line, plus whatever I add to it for the next year, hopefully another $500. Then I'm starting my third year with $1000 in dividends. It's a barrel rolling down the hill, picking up speed. I have about 40 years to invest before I hit senior citizen status. In a worst case scenario, if my life situation never improves money wise and I only ever achieve $500 in new dividends each year on top of my pre-existing dividends...I still make at retirement my take home pay right now.   


Statistics have shown that the investors who make the most money are not those who try to time the market, looking for those sweet cheat codes to financial freedom. Instead, the investors who make the most money are the ones who just contribute a regular amount to normal/boring investments every month and never stop.   


There is something to be said for exciting stocks versus boring ones, and that is to say that you should be excited in what you are buying into, but for the right reasons. To me, I see a boring company like LEG or IP and I get excited because I know that they are still going to be in business a decade from now, doing what they're doing, paying me dividends. I also want to buy into companies whose products I like and use, like KO for Coke, UN for Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, T for HBO and Warner Media. But there are also stocks and funds I want to buy into because I legitimately am excited for the work that they do and the potential they have for the future. Those are all things to consider when you are buying a stock. But I think to be the most successful you have to look at the company/fund in these ways, because if you go off of something as volatile as dividend yield it could leave you invested in a company on it's way to disaster.   


By all means, invest in the risky shit, but understand that while all of investing is gambling, that's gambling with your future in a very real way. Keep those stocks to a small amount of your portfolio...use the dividends to buy into safer companies. If they do well you profit regardless, but if they don't do well, it's only a small part of the portfolio. You gotta understand your risk tolerance and learn to stay within those bounds. Keep your regular investments the same but maybe set aside a little money every month just for a risky purchase. At the end of the day, no one can tell you exactly how YOU should be investing, so your best bet is to set goals for yourself that you can readily achieve and then try to hit those goals on a timed basis...weeks, months..whatever. Some sort of metric that shows you are accomplishing goals, that you are making headway, even if it looks like it will take forever...you will have proof that you are making progress. And when you see the numbers increasing and increasing, maybe it will help ease your mind about if you could just cut those corners and invest in all high-yield gambles.",10,1591167797.0

t3_gwipbc,fsvpkbu,"At the risk of being downvoted because I am not providing you with sources of information (as requested by you), I will share with you my mentality and mindset. This is why I personally invest in dividend paying stocks:

1. I mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses.
2. Since I intend on holding forever, I must choose well established HIGH-QUALITY BLUE-CHIP DIVIDEND PAYING companies with wide economic moats because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (if not more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity.

People often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid. This will be the responsibility of my future children and my future grandchildren.

Finally, it is often said that the first $1,000,000 is the most difficult to secure. Going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 is easier. But, the easiest is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. My overall intent is to be the guy who fucking sets it all up, educates the next generation, and secure generational wealth for my last name. #thuglifeinvesting",20,1591291632.0

&#x200B;

**1) XOM/CVX/HAL**

* Oil and gas is in a long-term secular decline. These companies are heavily invested in what is slowly becoming a legacy business. Yes, oil isn't going anywhere right now but we are seeing a progressive shift to renewable energy sources and electric vehicles which will eat into the demand for oil and gas. You may argue that oil is necessary for petrochemical products such as plastics but there are alternative methods out there for producing these same items that are further cutting into the demand for oil.
* These companies carry huge amounts of debt since they are in a highly capital-intensive business (the infrastructure they require is very expensive)
* Profitability of these companies depends on the price of oil which is subject to sudden change/disruption from OPEC/Russia.

&#x200B;

**2) MO**

&#x200B;

* Long term secular decline in industry
* Number of smokers (4-5% annually) will eat into revenues over the long-term. Prices can only be increased so much and can only transiently offset revenue loss from user decline (though I think this will take some time to occur)
* They have made very bad investment decisions in CRON and JUUL (significantly overpaid). This, to me, indicates that management is very desperate and aware of their need to GTFO tobacco ASAP due to the secular decline issue I mentioned
* Their investments may pan out long-term but it's risky nonetheless

&#x200B;

**3) IBM**

&#x200B;

* Terribly indebted
* Has not had any appreciable revenue growth
* Long-term revenue growth is contingent on their successful execution of Red Hat acquisition which carries high risk because they're competing with big boys like Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure)

&#x200B;

**4) T/VZ**

&#x200B;

* Prone to disruption long-term from star-link
* T has a ton of debt
* Anemic revenue growth

**5) IRM**

&#x200B;

* Also experiencing long-term secular decline due to legacy paper business slowing down.
* IRM is trying to get into digital data storage solutions but they are somewhat late to the game and there are lots of other competitors out there (like DLR)
* IRM's revenue growth in future is highly contingent on them pivoting to digital successful and emerging first in the sector.

2. Concerning your question as to  ""why wouldn't most investors focus on the amount per share?"".

t3_gwzhv7,fsyr954,"Dividend Yield is almost ***always*** calculated on an ANNUAL BASIS.

ANNUAL dividend yield = ANNUAL\_DIVIDEND\_PAYMENTS / stock\_price

Understanding Dividend Yield is very important. So lets do some exercises.

Go to the link above.. Its a list of stocks r/dividends favors.

For each stock, look up its stock price, and how much it pays in dividends per quarter.

Lets do $KO Coke, together

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO?p=KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO?p=KO)

The stock price as of NOW is $47.92

[https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/calendar?symbol=KO](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/calendar?symbol=KO)

I like TD Ameritrade for its dividend calendar (AND NO DAMN ADS) , but yahoo has it too.

The stock calendar says that if you hold the stock before JUNE 12, 2020 (EX-DIVIDEND date) you will be paid $0.41 a share, to be paid into your account on JULY 1, 2020 (PAY DATE). 

Now thats $0.41 per quarter (every 3 months). $0.41 x 4 = $1.64 a year (ANNUAL!!!!)

so your ANNUAL dividend yield = ANNUAL\_DIVIDEND\_PAYMENTS / stock\_price

Annual\_Dividend\_Yield = $1.64 / $47.92

Annual\_Dividend\_Yield = 3.42%

You can kinda think of this yield like an interest payment. You lend Coke $47.92, and they pay you interest of $0.41, every quarter (3 months). This money goes directly into your brokerage account.

Now, do this calculation for a bunch of stocks on that list i sent you.

Keep doing it until you understand what dividend yield is and its relation to the input variables. Do it by hand, with a hand calculator. 

If you did the exercise, then you might notice something.

If the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!

Say that in the mirror to yourself ,a hundred times, every morning.

If the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!

If the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!

If the stock price goes down, the yield goes UP!!!!!!

Now, think of what happened in the last few months.

Corona Virus DUMPED the prices of stocks!!!!!

This was like CHRISTMAS for Dividend investors!!!!

While everyone else was crying that their portfolios were dwindling, Dividend Investors were jumping for joy and buying stocks at a record pace! It was like a garage sale! Lots of us ran out of money by the end of March! 

When the stock market is raging bulls (doing great), Dividend Investors relax, knowing that companies are strong and their dividends are safe. When the market tanks, yes, we may get some dividend cuts on ***OUR GAMBLE BETS***, but we are happy to buy up tons of new shares!

But generally speaking, the valuation on any stock- dividend paying or not, should remain the same. With a long term time horizon in mind, I would simply ask if you believe the stocks are undervalued or fair value. If they are, and you are happy with the current yield, go for it. Another way to protect yourself is to dollar cost average over a certain timeframe if you are worried about a steep decline.",3,1591457671.0
t3_gxsrwx,ftdc2j1,"I think you are misunderstanding.

Heres the basic math:

AnnualDividendYield = AnnualDividendPayments / PriceYOUpaidForTheStock

Lets say a stock pays out $1.00 in dividends per year.

If you buy that stock for $2.00 a share, then every year, you make 50% on your cash.

AnnualDividendYield = AnnualDividendPayments/ PriceYOUpaidForTheStock

AnnualDividendYield = $1.00 / $2.00

AnnualDividendYield = 50%

If you bought it for $3.00 a share...

AnnualDividendYield = $1.00 / $3.00 = 33%

If you bought it for $5.00 a share

AnnualDividendYield = $1.00 / $5.00 = 20%

If you bought it for $25.00 a share

AnnualDividendYield = $1.00 / $25.00 = 4%

If you bought it for $100.00 a share

AnnualDividendYield = $1.00 / $25.00 = 1%

If you bought it for $1000.00 a share

AnnualDividendYield = $1.00 / $1000.00 = less then 1%

The long term capital gain rate if your overall income is less than $40,000 is at 0%. You can google search the other brackets.

the pros of drip are: 

1) if it’s set up correctly then it’s automatic and takes the emotion out of investing, you don’t have to think about it.

Cons of DRIP
1) you don’t have control of the money, it’s going to stock xyz whether you like it or not. 
2) if for some reason this quarter you need extra cash, you can’t access the money, it’s going to xyz. 
3) depending on how the drip is set up, if the drip does not allow for fractional shares and fractional dividend payouts then you may have to wait a long time to build up enough dividend cash to buy even 1 share of stock xyz, losing out on that compounding.

t3_h09wk4,fupt13u,"Here's a bit of a different take on O's payout ratio.

Dividends are paid with cash. Thus you really need to know the cash the REIT has available to pay the dividend. The best measure of cash is not FFO or AFFO or CAD or even Free Cash Flow (FCF). All of these are used by the media because none of them are GAAP numbers and so are subject to manipulation.

Consolidated Funds From Operations, or CFFO, is a GAAP number, meaning it is the actual accounting of cash available to REIT management after all operational bills have been paid and any changes in working capital accounts that changes the amount of cash available. It is reported each quarter on the Statement of Cash Flows, one of the 3 required financial reports (Income statement and Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet) are the other two) If you subtract from CFFO any preferred dividends and/or distributions to non-controlling interests, what you then have is Net CFFO. This is what common dividends are paid from and is the single best measure of available cash.

For Realty Income, using rolling 4Q (a full 12 months) data, the Net CFFO for for the 4Q ending 1Q20 was ($MM) $1,120 while common dividends paid were $881, for a dividend payout ratio of 78.7%

t3_h0z8bb,ftqgwbd,"Your portfolio looks incredible for a 16 year old with a couple months experience. Here's some advice from me, someone who started last year at 28, and am very jealous of how much further you can go compared to myself lol. I'm just gonna rattle stuff off the top of my head, so there's no particular rhyme or reason for the order in which I list this stuff;  



* 16 is very young to be planning for your future, and by that I mean things in your life will change drastically in the next two years, and then every year after that until about 25 you and your life is gonna be constantly changing and growing and evolving. Write down now some goals that you want to accomplish in the next 10 years. Then every 6 months from now until then, look at that list and see how you feel about it, Observe if you're on your way to meeting those goals and write down new updated goals if those goals you wrote down have changed in any way. Doing that on a six month basis will not only keep you motivated, but as you grow and spend more time down this path it will allow you to see what is and what is not as important to you anymore. Investing and Personal Finance in general are no different than any other part of your life, it needs to grow with you, not stay unchanged for possibly decades on end.   


* Even though it looks like you already have quite a bit of money in the market for only a couple months investing, understand this is a journey that pays off most in the long run. By the way you have worded things, it feels like you're looking more to FIRE than to just build a retirement fund. That makes this point even more important. If you try and rush yourself to FIRE as soon as possible, you're likely going to make rash decisions for what to invest in. Your portfolio at the moment however seems to reflect an understanding of quality companies to invest in. At your age, every dollar invested now is estimated to be worth $4-5 in the future. Keep that in mind as you expand your portfolio and continue down your investment path, your money has the potential to quadruple if you stay the course, investing in good, solid investments.  


* Since you're investing in individual companies as well as ETF's, invest some time to understand at least a basic understanding of what your individual companies do, how they operate and what things in the market would cause them to go up in value and down in value. This doesn't have to be deep analysis, but just some general understanding of what it is you're investing in. If you can't summarize in like 30 seconds what a company or fund does and how they make money, you should not invest in it. Knowing MSFT might go up or down based on sale of devices against AAPL's sale of devices is good, but knowing that MSFT's biggest area of expansion is web services, putting them in direct competition with AMZN is better.   


* Look for some smaller, but strong dividend growers that could provide you both growth in stock value as well as a dividend. Most of the companies you picked are very solid, but hardly move the needle in terms of value. Nothing wrong with that, especially when starting out, but there are lots of stocks and funds out there that could end up being a titan of your portfolio decades down the line, providing a line of dividends that match some of these dividend titans.   


* Make a monthly budget, and update it every time something in your life changes. It has been proven by multiple studies that the people in the stock market who make the most money are those who invest a regular amount of money every month and every year, regardless of how the market is doing on a month to month basis. Budgeting allows you to see how much money you can safely contribute to investments without making yourself broke in the meantime to accomplish your goals. Make sure any financial obligations are taken care of first, and make sure you can live your day to day life without the amount of money being put into investments. You do not want to miss out on fun with your friends or skimp on eating meals solely because you chose to spend your last $100 to gain $1.76 a year from DIS. 
  

* By that same token, make sure you are paying yourself by putting a monthly contribution to savings in a savings account, even better if it has a high yield.  When it comes to investing and personal finance, you want to make sure you have a healthy amount of money saved up to tap into in case something unexpected happens. This savings account is not only a tool to help you build your personal wealth and help you buy more expensive things in life, but this is also a buffer against having to ever touch your investments in case of emergency. If your car suddenly needs emergency repairs, if your pet (or child) needs an emergency medical visit, if your mattress falls out of the back of your friend's pickup while moving across town (all have happened to me between 18-28) your savings account will exist as a safety net for how you will pay for it. If it can be avoided, you do not want to ever have to sell your investments in order to pay for an unexpected expense.   


* Know your tax obligations for your investments. I do not know how taxes on dividends work for a minor or know your specific tax situations going forward; but I do know that at some point and in some time you will have to declare your dividends for tax purposes. Know that dividends from REIT's and MLP's are taxed as if you earned that money normally, and must pay tax on them, whereas regular stocks and funds have a different threshold entirely for how they are taxed...which for me is not at all at the moment. These investing subs praise O for it's amazing dividend, but hardly anyone talks about how you owe taxes on all those O dividends since it's a REIT.   


* If you don't have one already, open a ROTH IRA as soon as you are able to. You are only allowed to contribute $6,000 a year of your own money into it, but the money sits there until you are 60 growing tax free. This is the perfect place for REIT's because you will never have to pay taxes on those dividends while they are in there. Have a ROTH IRA with some solid investments and solid REIT's in it and contribute a regular monthly amount to it as well.   


* Last but not least, have fun with it! Growing your wealth should be a fun, if not a little boring. At any time if it causes you stress or hardship, you gotta evaluate what and why that is. In my first couple months I invested in things that were much riskier than I should have been dealing with, and I spent every waking moment obsessing over those choices. As they dropped in value, I questioned everything I had done up to this point, and as they rose in value I panicked over whether I was making the right choice by keeping them instead of selling at a profit. It consumed me, worrying that every move I was making was wrong. For now it seems like you've avoided that particular pitfall. But keep an eye on your future possible investments. Make up a watchlist of potential future stock picks, and keep an eye on them as you go. By the time you consider adding another stock to your portfolio from your watchlist, you at that point should have a decent idea of how it performs, what you are expecting to happen as you buy in.

I'm assuming you've already done this but show her a chart of the S&p 500. I feel like that alone should be enough to convince anyone. Over the past 90 years the market has returned 7 to 8% annually adjusted for inflation. Compare that with your average savings account generating 1.5% or less per year the difference in value at just the 5 year mark is insane, let alone 30 years when you're ready to retire. 

Investing in something (stocks, real estate, a business, etc) is an absolute necessity for the majority of the population. It is the ONLY way to build long term wealth. 

Most importantly - explain compound growth to her and the rule of 70. The rule goes - divide 70 by the annual growth rate of your investment to get the amount of time it would take your investment to double. If you invest 10k in the s&p at a 7% growth rate in 30 years you will have 80k. If you put 10k into a savings account yielding 1.5% it would take you 46 years just to double your money to 20k. Which means it would take you 140 years to get to 80k!!

People here view dividends as superior to capital gains, which is a complete fallacy. In most cases capital gains are now tax efficient than dividends. Monetizing your shares is also just as easy.

You will get people saying that you need to sell your shares for cap gains, but dividends are essentially forcing you to monetize your ownership every quarter instead of when you want. These people are also seemingly unaware that splits exist.

Now, here is what I am doing:

1. Personally for me, regardless of conditions, there is no change in plan/strategy. As an individual with a stable income, high job security (i.e. military officer), and a decent emergency fund, I am always 100% equities and there will be no change in buying more or less. I do not care about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, ""all time highs"", ""all time lows"" or wherever we are on the ""graph"". I do not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, I really really really do not care at all. Volatility does not mean anything to me since I am a super long-term investor;
2. I'm not a smart person, I cannot predict the future, and I cannot time the market. Personally, I believe that time in the market is superior to timing the market (as per academic studies). Therefore, I invest on average, half of my pay, every time I get paid (i.e. every two weeks) because I am boring; and
3. Finally, again, generally speaking, I do not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects my purchasing behavior). I will simply continue with my unshakable discipline in my plan to buy well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until I retire or die. I am building a financial fortress brick-by-brick every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is ""different"" because I am a boring thug life investor who just doesn't give a fuck about volatility).

In general, I don't consider index investing to be that safe despite the diversification because of the weights they give individual holdings is almost always based on market capitalization. In other words, an ETF portfolio will hold more of the popular stocks in a particular index, rather than the highest quality or most representative of its industry kind of stock.

What you referring to is dividend yield right.. dividend per share divided by price per share.

High dividend yields are not always better and might reflect several things, for example:

1. Unsustainable payout ratios i.e the company is paying too much of its income in dividends and might cut them in the future
2. Lack of growth opportunities for the business.. if a company doesn't see many opportunities to reinvest in the business they may choose to pay out a higher percentage of income in dividends

They say diversification preserves wealth and doesn't create it.  But with income investing, diversification is more important imo.  So with that said, I would own a mix of a few etfs and individual stocks.

For etfs I would choose from 
SPHD
SPYD
SCHD
NOBL
DGRO
VIG

And if you want international in the mix then add:
VIGI
EFAV
VXUS
VEA/VWO mix

So having a mix of a couple of these etfs gives you the SWAN effect on dividends.  They are not going to go under, and gives you the place to add more shares during times when the individual stocks are overpriced in your opinion.

Then I would look at individual stocks in each sector.  How many in each or ""every"" sector is up to you.  But the 3 sectors as an income investor I would definitely be in are utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.  I personally also have tech, consumer discretionary, and reits.  

But out of those sectors choose well established companies that you know and believe in.  For example in utilities I own SO, and ED.  Other people may like D, DUK better.  And that' fine by me.  But just have a gameplan on the individual stocks you own and only sell when the stock has met the reasons for you.

Fidelity is my favorite because they helped do some research for me. Also where i put my HSA(heath).

Robinhood because i wanted to start and got a free stock. Ask a friend for referral. Its too simple is a big issue and lacks updates and info when you learn more things. 

Vanguard because I was new and it was more for my roth ira. If i could go back id keep my stuff at fidelity. I can still buy vanguard etfs i want.

M1: allows only two times a day at trading and you dont get to pick. Its great for set it and forget it but thats against my investment mindset and ideal. Soon as i found out i cancelled my initial investment. I time market a bit with some DCA.

Make sure to keep your brokerage few. If you ever decide to transfer there is a fee. I want to cancel my robinhood but its quick to buy and sell phone wise. Id stick to vanguard and fidelity.

Quality over quantity and I don't even mean in the number of stocks. I'm talking about quality dividends over yield %. Sell most of this trash before you lose more money.

Let's talk more about the first one on your list ACP. It loses value every year but you get your nice dividend. Looking at the 5 year chart, it started at 14.36. it's now at 9.11. so you lost 5.25 per share. I haven't even checked the dividend history, but let's go with the current dividend of 1.44 that I see on Yahoo finance. So 5 years of dividends is 7.2. nice so you think you are ahead by about $2. Great. Except you forgot tax. Since it's a cef, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it gets tax at your income bracket, not the same as a qualified dividend. For purposes of the example I will go with the 15% tax rate.  So you really received 6.12. so about 0.90 over 5 years.  That comes out to about 6.3% return over  the full 5 years, not to be confused with 6.3% per year.

1. Dividend investing in general is much slower but arguably less prone to volatility.

You kinda abuse time in the market>timing the market via compound interest. im sure i dont need to explain the difference of 30 years of compound interest vs 31.
2. Growth investing can be applied to dividend investing. just look at some of the stable companies (T, V, MA) that have low yields and can just raise the dividend in the future. Rather than trying to find the next FB/MSFT/AMZN, you can spend your time with the established

t3_hdbco2,fvlmixl,"I just turned 29 last month, I'm one of those around the sub that says I wish I started early instead of a year ago.  


Here's what I think ultimately; Yeah growth stocks are cool, and making a bunch of money on one (or two) would be like winning the lottery. But I've always been risk-adverse. My family loves to go gambling at the casino. When I go, I have a hard time parting with $100 if I don't win it back. I also have notoriously bad instincts when it comes to finances, and have had to severely plan and structure my spending to make sure I don't make wasteful purchases or throw money at something on a whim and then never getting it back. Right now I am invested in 10 dividend stocks and I have 1 purely growth stock, a play for the future with a small amount of money. If it does well over time, I'll DCA in to a larger position and ride it out for quite some time, maybe into retirement with the rest of my funds.   


What I like better about dividends is having the power of compound interest on my side. I can take anything I earn from dividends and keep rolling it into bigger and bigger investments that don't cost me anything while also continually investing with my own money to grow the dollars earned even faster. While holding a growth stock can be cool, especially if it's something insane like TSLA...but I feel like for someone like me, holding onto stuff like that would just make me nervous about finding the right time to sell. My portfolio is potentially running 40 years with me into retirement, do I want 40 years of wondering when the best time to sell my investment is?   


I'd rather hold and collect money at the same time, and if I want to sell my stocks at retirement for the big cash out I can...or I can keep holding to collect the dividends and the portfolio could potentially keep paying after I'm dead. As cool as growth stocks are, they aren't making me money while I hold them, and that's something that I have to consider as I inch closer to being 30. I think the younger you are, the more you should be willing to take risks with growth stocks, but come at it from a dividend perspective.

You are at the age to find some good, higher yielding dividend stocks to hold. Utilize DRIP and have them auto reinvest upon dividend payout. Try to set yourself up with a good monthly payout so check out quarterly and monthly dividend payout stocks to offset div payout dates. High yield ETFs are good for small growth but consistent dividend payouts. Individual stocks like KO, MSFT, T, WM, and a ton of other aristocrat style stocks are good for long term growth and consistent dividends. Remember they are never guarantee but a LOT of ETFs or stocks don't want to lose their coveted ""increase in dividend payout"" once they have several yrs of increases. Google top rated dividend stocks and you'll find a ton. Once you get a good base down start stock finding and looking for more quick""growth"" stocks you can buy/sell.

You're already on the right path to dividend investing. If you want to mix it up and add a growth ETF, do it, but make it a small portion of your portfolio as a whole. If it pays big, you win big.

VIG outperforms SPY. Here is a list of ETF comparisons. I prefer dividend ETFs like SPHD and VYM even though they have slower growth.

t3_hd94si,fvk1nhu,I personally have built out a portfolio of 50 dividend paying stocks which I will from time to time from through and get updates on how they are doing individually and as a sector and make adjustments to allocation as I see fit. This give me broad diversification that I would gain from a small ETF but allows me more control over it rather than just blindly allowing a computer to organize the portfolio for me. If you want a solid starting point I would suggest looking up Joseph Carlson and viewing his portfolio and adding/subtracting stocks from it as you see fit. Idk I prefer doing this and in effect curating my own little ETF. You can supplement it with actual ETF’s but from my perspective it’s more engaging to have some say in where your money goes instead of just going with an index. The index to me just feels like put to big money into a high volatility saving account as opposed to actually investing. Know what your investing IMO,12,1592761616.0
t3_hd94si,fvjui8y,"*"" My question is why are not dividend ETFs not recommended more around here? ""*

I can speak only for myself, but here are a couple of reasons:

Expenses. If you hold a dividend paying ETF and dividends as income is your primary goal, then depending on the ETF, you may be giving up >10% of the fund's total dividends to expenses. I call it the Income Expense Ratio. You can determine this for a given ETF by going to their annual shareholder report, go to the Statement of Operations and find the total of fund expenses and dividend this by the fund's total income (dividends and interest). That is the IER.

You must hold low yielding stocks, junky dividends or very risky dividend stocks if they are part of the universe of stocks the ETF must hold. For example, the REIT ETF VNQ must hold the likes of BDN and SNH and whatever the new name of GOV is. These REITs are dogs by any other name and I would never hold them. But as part of the ETF, you must.

If the ETF is industry specific, then you are diversifying for non-systematic risk (individual security risk), but you are actually concentrating broad industry risk. Consider the financials ETF XLF. From the summer of 2007 when priced at around $30, by early 2009 it dropped to under $10. It took the fund to the end of 2019 to get back to $30. Dividends/share paid in 2007 were $.87. This dropped to $.16 in 2010, growing to $.58 for 2019.",6,1592757750.0
t3_hd94si,fvjrbn2,"I recommend putting most of your money in an etf, dividend ETFs are fine as well.

t3_hg9w2w,fw2x79p,"When building a dividend portfolio, here are the rules in how I personally invest:

1) Invest in what you know. Don't recognize the name?  Don't put your money there. Feel free to research a company if you are curious, but don't invest until you can explain how that company makes money to a five year old.

2) When picking a company, it needs to pass three tests for me. Is revenue growing at a steady/sustainable pace?  Is profit growing at a steady/sustainable pace? Is the divided growing at a steady/sustainable pace?

3) Don't let any company become more than 5% of your portfolio. Diversification is important. Never put all your eggs in one basket.

4) Don't chase yield. Look at the yield in relation to the payout ratio. That will give you a more accurate picture. If you have a company with a 5% divided yield but a 30% payout ratio, you may have just stumbled on a bargain. 

5) Inflation is an obstacle you must conquer to have sustainable passive income. If a company is growing their divided slower than inflation, while simultaneously paying out a divided lower than inflation, you are losing money. I've seen too many dividend investors forget inflation and subsequently realize they are making less year over year because of it. 

These are just some starter pieces of advice that most people don't think about as much as they really should.",14,1593191596.0

 3. I love the company (in that I will stick by it in bad times and good times just like I will stick to family, friends, etc.);

 4. There is a general trend in capital appreciation over time (even in bad times);

 5. There is a general trend in increased revenue over time (even in bad times);

 6. The company does not have overburdening levels of debt;

 7. The company has a wide economic/competitive moat (i.e. monopoly, duopoly, or oligopoly);

 8. The company is a Dividend King, Dividend Aristocrat, or Dividend Champion;

t3_hiojd2,fwhlbrj,"Lets break down your whole portfolio here., but first:

>I like the 6.5%+ yields

6.5% yields are 9 times out of 10 companies which are not doing so hot. T is the exception, not the rule.  Yield chasing is not how you want to live your life. Nobody makes money yield chasing. Every yield chaser loses money. 

But anyways, lets take a look:

>Energy Transfer

2/10. Sell. Revenue and Profit are soaring, but the dividend is remaining stagnant.  However, the payout ratio is also simultaneously somehow way too high. The company is taking on debt to fund a dividend, when the company isnt even 20 years old. It is always concerning when a young company is taking on debt to pay a dividend. 

This company clearly is either staffed with incompetent management, greedy management who prioritize their own paychecks over the long term health of the company, or some combination of the two. 

Good replacement: Dominion Energy. 

>Chimera

0/10. Sell. Similar to ET. Debt to fund the dividend is never healthy. Except this company is actually reducing its dividend while still taking on debt to fund the reduced dividend.  This is how companies enter death spirals.

 In 2010 it paid out $.76 a share. Yet now you are getting $0.30 a share in 2020. Sell out and write this loss off.

Good replacement: Home Depot (add some diversity to your portfolio)

>Altria

3/10. Sell. Cigarettes are a dirty business.  They are all effectively squeezing blood from a stone right now. The smoking population has been going nothing but down for decades. The addictive properties of cigarettes make for a good recurring customer base, but unfortunately cigarettes have a tendency to kill their best customers. Rapid price increases are leading to record profits now, but they are pricing out potential new customers. Smoking rates for young people are at historic lows, and just keep getting lower. Eventually, this company will start to slide, then it will be nothing but down.   Due to the taxes on cigarettes, decreasing the price is virtually impossible.

I would stay away from the industry as a whole, because once the slide starts, it will never stop. 

Good replacement: Kimberly Clark. The women in your life need tampons, and the babies of the world need diapers. Kimberly Clark is a market leader in both.

>ATT

I'm actually pretty bullish on AT&T. Management hadnt been held accountable for quite some time, but now someone is holding their feet to the fire, and the company looks poised to clean itself up. Even if it doesn't, the dividend is well covered by earnings and the company has an IP library rivalled only by Disney.

Companion pick: Verizon.  I like T and Verizon to be equal weight in my portfolio.

>Enterprise

I would hold for right now and see which way the wind blows. Lots of debt to fund prior dividends. Company looks like it is trying to turn itself around. 

Replacement if the company regresses: Microsoft. Well diversified tech company.

>Universal

Don't really have strong opinions on this one to make a definitive judgement. I haven't looked at the numbers enough. I would compare and contrast it with Disney, then pick whichever has the better balance sheet. 

>SImon properties

Just announced a dividend cut. No thank you. Plenty of REITs out there with a balance sheet able to weather the storm.

Good replacement: O. The company speaks for itself. 

>Exxon,

Oil is a dying breed propped up by the US government. Every major utility company that relies on oil has promised to phase out oil in the next decade or two. 

Good replacement: NextEra Energy.",62,1593533972.0
t3_hiojd2,fwi1lee,"To analyze safe dividends, pay attention to the following ten points:

1. Dividend Coverage: Does the company have enough money to pay the dividend?
2. Dividend Growth: A company growing its dividends consistently is a great indicator of financial and operational health.
3. Earnings/Free Cash Flow Growth: A company’s cash floe must coincide with dividend growth. If cash flow does not grow with the dividend, the company cannot afford to grow its dividend indefinitely.
4. Interest Coverage: Can the company pay its debt? Interest Coverage compares the company’s  earnings to the interest expense on debt. It is ideal for earnings to be at least twice that of its interest expense. A score of 26 is excellent and indicates earnings far exceed debt.
5. Debt To Equity Ratio: A higher score is a better score. The higher a specific securities’ percentile, the better.
6. Credit Rating: The better the rating, the better a company’s credit worthiness as a borrower. This indicates a good ability to pay back debts, which is itself a good indicator of good financial position.
7. Prior Recession Performance: Did the company collapse? Did the stock take a hit? Did it rebound? A longer history is often a good indicator of health. Companies like Visa only went public in 2008, so there is not much information on Visa in this regard.
8. Cyclicality: General Mills has smooth and steady earnings. People want to constantly eat their food products. On the other hand, clothing stores
9. Dividend Longevity: How long has the company paid the dividend? Have they consistently paid dividends?
10. Company Values, Culture, and Commitment to Dividends: Realty Income (O) is all about dividends—it is a culture of dividends and commitments to investors.",9,1593541616.0

Don't fall for the yield-trap. I am fairly new to dividend growth investing (unfortunately!), and bought some of the typical dividend stocks during the drops to capture high yields. But I will not go forward expecting a 8.5% yield on Altria, or 4.5% yield on KO.

Yeah it takes a bit more work than just throwing it all into a single ETF but you never know what could happen to any company, including ETF’s. 

If I were you and had $1000, I would put $500 into SPHD. Decent monthly yield with very low volatility that required companies switching it to hit certain standards and if they don’t, they get replaced with a different company that does reach the standard. Next I would put about $300 into O, a REIT that also pays dividends monthly that has been pretty strong even through the entire pandemic from my experience. For the last $200, I would split it evenly across KO, LEG, KMI, and maybe NRZ or perhaps grab part of an AAPL share, just to give some extra diversification.

WFC is about to cut their dividend in Q3, have shady business practices, and are under a strict regulatory cap that limits their ability to grow assets (and thus revenue). WFC is like the worst of all the banking stocks TBH.

MO has the long-term headwind of secular decline in the smoking population and management has desperately tried and epicly failed at branching out into other revenue streams (see overpriced acquisition of JUUL and CRONOS). Also, the payout ratio is at 80% which is very concerning.

&#x200B;

XOM and CVX also face secular decline in the coming few decades and are highly commodity-price dependent. If oil goes down these companies will shit the bed. They have no effective plans to transition to renewable which is going to grow like a weed.

&#x200B;

PFE has a massively unimpressive pipeline. With the recent sell-off of their generics business this might change. Not enough innovation/R&D in pharma = death.

Sell your PFE and put it into ABBV. 

Sell XOM/CVX and buy BEP or HASI (BEP is a renewable energy financing/infrastructure play while HASI is a reit that owns renewable energy assets).

Sell WFC and put it into any other stock. Banks are going to have a hard time trying to make money in this low interest rate environment.

Couple things that I've learned over the past few months of fucking with stocks, reading everything i can understand on investopedia from the ground up, etc:

1. Don't chase yields. 4% IS worth it because it leaves room for the company to grow, instead of paying all their profits in dividends. That 4% is going to come back to you over the course of 25 quarters. If that dividend grows past 4% you're looking at even less time until you're getting free money. If you chase, you risk way overpaying because stock price tends to go up closer to EX day. 

2. Diversity is key, especially with just about everything susceptible to Covid. If you have 100k at your disposal, I highly recommend buying at least a couple shares of Amazon, NVDA, AAPL and MSFT. You're not likely to regret those purchases. (Go ahead. Light me up for saying buy amazon! I deserve it!)

3. Don't spend it all in one day or all in one minute. 930 to 1030 am prices tend to be the highest. Fridays tend to have a slide at the end of the day because some people never hold over the weekend. Wait for opportunity to strike. 

4. Most important for last; Do your own research. I say this not to be a dick, but why trust me telling you to buy AMZN AAPL MSFT and NVDA? Buy shares in companies that you know will be around for a long time. Learn PB ratio, PE ratio, Debt equity ratio, etc. So that you know how to value a company and so you can make the determination of whether or not they're overvalued or undervalued or right on par.

This is mainly due to the annual contribution limit of only $6000. Since the Canadian government seems to change the maximum deposit amount every few years, I think the best strategy would be to Max out the contribution (if you can) until you have 120% of one year's worth of living expenses saved up in there. 

Now, take the part of the portfolio's amount which should be equivalent to 1 year's expenses and put it in the safest assets you can that are tied directly to inflation. This will be your emergency fund. If you lose your job and need to survive off savings, these assets are what you will draw from.

The other part of your portfolio (equivalent to 20% of a year's expenses), take it and invest in buy & forget dividend stocks. Companies which will outlive us all.  Waste Management, Stanley Black and Decker, Hormel, Toronto Dominion Bank, CNI, etc. Companies you don't need to think about. These companies will grow your emergency fund to reflect cost of living increases that are not inflation related. 

Say you have a major change in lifestyle that dramatically increases your expenses (like having kids).  That's okay. Your unused contributions roll over to the next year with no limit, so you could just top up your account to maintain the ratios. Just remember to reinvest every cent of your dividends. Don't touch the account and if you get married, sign a prenup that exempts it from divorce. Guard that account more than your house.

Free cash flow is the operating cash flow minus the company's capital expenditures. Some big things that are in the operating cash flow (or net cash provided by operating activities) are depreciation and amortization being added back in, accounts payable and receivable are in there, any impairment amount is added back in, and any other specific amortizations are added in. So operating cash flow is typically bigger than income unless the company owes services to a lot of people and doesn't have a lot of depreciation they can claim (red flag if you ever see this). The capital expenditures is where the company is allocating its capital and includes items like purchases of property and equipment, acquisitions, dispositions, and construction. So a company's free cash flow is higher than its income if the income is less than the difference between its operating cash flow and its capital expenditures (pretty much all of the time).

In doing your research you know that the dividends collected don't get qualified tax status, the potential gains are small per trade, and you're effective having to operate as a day trader in order to ensure share price moves don't eat the dividend collected:

you really should understand that the company paying the dividend doesn't change anything before taxes. You own stock x which is worth $10 and it pays you a yearly dividend of $0.50. Assuming no change in outlook and other stuff the value of the company remains the same and the stock is still worth $10 before the ex-dividend date. After the ex-dividend date the stock is worth $10 -$0.50 = $9.50 and you have the stock and the dividend in cash which still amount to $10.

A [Dividend King](https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/kings/) worthy of any Dividend portfolio, this company has seen a little turbulence through the 2010s, with 2019 seeing a slight drop in revenue, but management has remained optimistic about the future of the company, and has continued to prioritize long term growth of both the company and the dividend. This company has been in my portfolio since the early days. A very good choice.

>Altria

There are many reasons to avoid the cigarette industry.  For starters, it is a dirty business. Your best customers are the ones who die from your products. The other major issue is that smoking rates among young people have been going nothing but down for decades. Despite the smoking rate decreasing, profits have never been higher. This is because prices have been rising year over year. Unfortunately for the cigarette companies, these price increases are the economic equivalent of squeezing blood from a stone. As the price rises, you are pricing potential customers out of the market, making the product unaffordable to most consumers. The average cost of a pack of cigarettes in the US was $5.51, though in most states it is between $6-$8.  Multiply $5.51*365 and you get a whopping $2011.15 to maintain one's smoking habit for a single year. Most Americans cannot afford that.  The taxes states impose on cigarettes are not meant to help people quit. They are designed to prevent people from starting.  I would never recommend trying to enter an industry the US government is actively trying to tax into the grave.

At some point, there will come a time when the price of a pack is so high that there is no turning back. When the slide in revenue starts, it will never stop. When that happens, I don't know, but considering the unsustainable rock bottom smoking rates of young people, it will likely be within your lifetime. Perhaps even within mine. 

To its credit, Altria is trying to buck the trend. It is trying to be the exception and diversify its business. The company is developing a balance sheet that could be incredibly robust for the long term. No matter how good this company looks on paper though, I could never invest.  Here's why:

[The following is not based on any data]

My father-in-law was a prolific smoker. Specifically of Marlboro cigarettes. The iconic packaging was an inseparable part of his personality, as he would always have a pack on his person at all times. My wife and I are both disgusted by cigarettes, but things reached a boiling point at our wedding. I'm actually allergic to certain chemicals in cigarettes, and so is my dad and his parents. My grandmother's allergy in particular advanced so badly that by the time in her life when my wife and I got married, she required an epi-pen to inhale cigarette smoke. As a result, we told my wife's family filled with chain smokers that there would be no cigarettes at our wedding at any time, so my grandmother could actually survive being outside her house (located next to a Mormon church with all Mormon neighbors).  The entirety of my wife's family completely understood and was very respectful, making great efforts to purge the cigarette smell from their persons. The one exception was my father in law. Long story short, my wife actually cried on our wedding day because he left the festivities three separate times to light up. As the father of the bride in an American wedding, his absence was noticed. After the third time, he smelled so bad I had to ban my own father in law from my own wedding so he would not hurt my grandma's sensitive lungs. She uses oxygen anyways, but considering the severity of her allergy, she can't be within a few feet of cigarette smoke without feeling the effects.

The worst part came when we found out my father in law was raping kids.  Thankfully he never did anything to my wife when she was growing up, but my father-in-law is currently sitting in prison for molestation of a 14-year-old. When we found out, instantly anything associated with the man became repulsive and drew up memories of my wife having a pedophile as a dad. That included his favorite brand of cigarettes, Marlboro, which is manufactured in the United States by Philip Morris USA (not to be confused with ticker PM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria. 

My wife sees Altria's dividend as blood money, as she wants nothing to do with her father (for obvious reasons) and so I will never buy stakes in Altria or any tobacco company, regardless of how well they perform in the market.

[Ending my opinion not based on data]

With that being said, Altria is currently allegedly in talks to reunite with Philip Morris international, which shows the companies know the end is near. They likely see consolidation and diversification as their only way out.

Recommended replacement: Kimberly Clark. I seem to find myself recommending this one in every dividend analysis. It is just simply a well run company.

>Coca Cola

Beautiful company.  Nuff said.

Recommended companion stock: Pepsico. I like to keep an equal combination of Coke and Pepsi in my portfolio. 

>IBM

This would have been an excellent pick in 1971. IBM today is a shell of its former self. Revenue has shed nearly $5 billion in the last five years. YoY profits have fallen in almost perfect lockstep with revenue, indicating this is not the company selling off unprofitable businesses. Operating Income is down by nearly 40% in the past five years, with net income down by around 30% in the same time period. All this has put the dividend under enormous pressure, as the payout ratio has roughly **doubled** over the past five years, when the dividend itself has only grown by around 25-30% in the same time. 

IBM is a perfect example of why you should never trust EPS. The company engaged in an extensive share buyback program through the 2010s which has masked these underlying problems. Management has already deflected responsibility onto the covid pandemic for 2020, but shareholders have stopped listening entirely. The company was down pre-pandemic, and it likely won't recover from the February sell-off anytime soon. I would steer clear, at least while this board maintains control. 

Recommended replacement: Microsoft.

>Walgreens

As a retail manager, analysis of retail companies is my area of expertise. In my personal opinion, I don't think management really knows what they are doing. The company has grown revenue by 30% in the past five years, but net income is...down.  As a retail manager, that is not how this is supposed to work. I can understand selling more lower margin products, but it is almost as though the company is branching out into unproductive and unprofitable side ventures.  The company seems aimless and unfocused, testing many new concepts at once, not really sure what will stick. 

Compare that with CVS, who recognized that in order to make it in the digital age, they needed to reinvent themselves. In 2018 the company made record amounts of profit, but chose to show a loss on their balance sheet. The company stopped raising the dividend and plowed every cent of available capital into the business and reinvesting in the company. Normally I hate stagnant dividends with a burning passion, but as someone who has spent their entire career in retail, I understand every word coming out of the CEOs mouth on their plan for the future and how they are trying to optimize the omnichannel experience, and I see the company's end vision, both in their investor materials and in my Google results.  When I search for pharmacy near me, the top three organic results are for CVS. However, if we actually measured it with a tape measure, the closest pharmacy is actually inside my local Kroger and practically within walking distance. 

Even though I am bullish on CVS, I'm not going to recommend it. This is a stock I would only suggest buying if you understand retail. Even then, it is not for everyone. My recommended replacement for Walgreens would have to be Johnson and Johnson.

>Wells Fargo

Considering the company just cut its dividend, and has mountain of lawsuits related to its verified fraud, I would stay away.

Recommended replacement: Bank of America or JP Morgan. 

>AT&T

I'm really bullish on AT&T long term. I think the Warner media empire is a force capable of rivaling Disney if wielded properly. Should the company be unsuccessful, it still has a massive reservoir of free cash flow capable of sustaining the dividend for quite some time.

>Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

Natural gas is not a very good long term play for someone your age.  If you were fifty, then maybe it would make sense, however, most utility companies see natural gas merely as a transition to cleaner forms of energy, and simply a way to meet emissions reduction goals for 2030 or whatever deadline the company has. Every US based publicly traded pureplay utility company I can find has on their website their intention to become carbon neutral or at the bare minimum reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.

What sectors should Disney and Comcast be in?

You are definitely right about the miscellaneous stocks.

t3_hotg7v,fxp80pr,"It’s been slightly touched on, but the tax advantages of a Roth IRA cannot be underestimated. In a taxable brokerage account you will be paying tax on every dividend you ever receive and any capital gains that are made from equity sales. In a Roth IRA, you won’t ever pay a single cent in taxes on any dividend. How much of a difference can this make?

Let’s assume you start with $0 at age 24.5. You can either contribute $6,000/year to a Roth IRA or $6,000/year to a taxable account. Let’s assume a 7% return annually. At age 59.5, after 35 years of investing you will end up with two very different numbers. 

Roth IRA: $830,000

Brokerage: $535,000

So in your Roth, if you have $830K and your account yields you a 3.5% dividend you are bringing in 29K in annual dividends, entirely tax free. 

In your brokerage, if you have 535K that yields 3.5%, you are bringing in $18,725 which is still going to be taxed, so you’ll receive even less! 

That’s the power of zero taxes. You’ll end up with half the income you could otherwise have, and only 2/3’s of the total account value.

Here are my thoughts:

1. Personally for me, regardless of conditions, there is no change in plan/strategy. As an individual with a stable income, high job security, a decent emergency fund, and zero debt, I am always 100% equities and there will be no change in buying more or less. I do not care about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, ""all time highs"", ""all time lows"" or wherever we are on the ""graph"". I do not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, I really, really, really, do not care at all. Volatility does not mean anything to me since I am a super long-term investor;
2. I openly admit that I am not a smart person, I am not a very well educated person, I cannot predict the future, and I certainly cannot time the market. Personally, I believe that time in the market is superior to timing the market (as per academic studies). Therefore, I invest on average, half of my pay, every time I get paid (i.e. every two weeks) because I am boring and I am stubborn. You will see many posts on reddit which speculate about what is going to happen in the future or strangers asking for predictions from other strangers. Again, I am not a smart person, but I can tell you that those people are really, really, really, not smart either and that you should just invest regularly and as much as you can while balancing a proper quality of life (whatever that means to you);
3. I also mainly invest for cashflow/dividends. Although capital appreciation is nice, I do NOT really care that much because I do NOT intend on selling. With that said, this does not mean that I do not care at all because capital appreciation is a quick and dirty metric for a company's performance. One day, my dividend payments, cashflow from stocks, passive income from stocks, or however you want to articulate it, will pay for ALL of my living expenses;
4. Since I intend on holding forever, I must choose well-established, high-quality, premium, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats and a proven track record of paying/increasing dividends through tough times because there is always a risk when it comes to investing. The main benefit of holding forever (in my opinion, which may be incorrect) is that it allows for greater compounding. Additionally, when I give this to my children, they will have an additional minimal annual salary of approximately $50,000/year (and most probably more). However, I sincerely hope that they do NOT take this supplemental salary from the dividends and simply allow it to compound even more until they retire. I also hope that this cycle repeats into perpetuity;
5. Since I am not an ""intelligent"" person, I do not ""daytrade"", I do not ""buy low, sell high"", I do not play with ""penny stocks"", and I do not try to ""time the market"". I am a ""dividend growth investor for the SUPER long-term"" (which will be defined in point #7);
6. I am happy in times of recession/depression since it allows me to buy more shit on sale and lock-in those ""future yields on cost"" as I have a stable income and a very secure job;
7. People often say that they are long-term investors (i.e. 10-25 years). I am different. I am a SUPER long-term investor. I intend for my portfolio to carry onward for 75-150 years. With that said, I understand that times will change; and therefore, the portfolio must be adjusted/fluid. This will be the responsibility of my future children and my future grandchildren;
8. Again, generally speaking, I do not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects my purchasing behavior). I will simply continue with my unshakable discipline in my plan to buy well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until I retire or die (even though statistically I will under perform an index ETF, but again, I am not smart nor educated); and
9. Finally, it is often said that the first $1,000,000 is the most difficult to secure. Going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 is easier. But, the easiest is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 due to miracle of compounding. My overall intent is to be the guy who fucking sets it all up, educates the next generation, and secure generational wealth for my last name. Essentially, I am building a financial fortress brick-by-brick every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is ""different"" because I am a boring investor who just simply doesn't give a fuck about volatility and I do not think that you should either).

That is my investing philosophy and why I invest for dividends. This strategy is not for everyone and many people will disagree with it; however, this is what works for me, myself, and I (which I believe is quite important in one's overall investing journey as well as their psychological well-being). I'm not here to argue about the irrelevance of dividends, why index ETFs are ""better"" or ""safer"", how the next few generations will waste my money, etc. I am just sharing my perspective.",9,1594517063.0

My dividend income now equals the income I made at my second job, so you guessed it, I quit my second job 2 months ago.

t3_hpcevi,fxpnoac,"While some of the ""high yield"" ETFs sound appetizing you'll be hard pressed to find reliability >5-6% yielding stocks/ETFs. Find a handful of quality monthly divs that you can watch the last 5-10yrs. If you see any negative decline don't even think about it. Stability or positive growth (at least prior to march 2020). Stick with 4-7% yield for these. Then look for a handful of quality quarterly div ETFs like the same above (4-7%). This will give you a good consistent payouts throughout the month to month depending on how you have it set up.   


Then, invest in 3-5 quality long term, high rated, 4/5 Morningstar rated ""Growth"" Dividend stocks. While the dividends on these are fairly low, they help your portfolio grow overtime utilizing high quality aristocrat stocks. I'd go with at least 3-5 of them to offset sectors that may temporarily take a hit. Most of these are between 0.5-2% div yield but the returns are great. They will be good long term hold/DRIP stocks. Randomly buy these or reinvest in them and they will pay you back well later. They will typically give your portfolio some stability if you are looking to be a primary dividend investor.

Glad you stopped yield chasing, I was down that rabbit hole for a while and now regret not putting that money in quality stocks like Apple or Microsoft (obv Tesla and amazon would have been insane lol)

Absolutely take advantage of your company’s 401k. My company also matches 6% and I personally hated their funds but am happy they allow for self directed investment, so I just do my own research and invest in those funds. What I recommend is to look at your salary or previous tax returns and see what brackets you fall under. After doing that adjust your pre-tax contributions to keep yourself in the reasonably lowest tax bracket and then put the rest in after tax (so that any dividends/growth aren’t subject to income tax when you withdraw during retirement). I plan to do this in the early stages of my career when I’m not making the full potential of my anticipated career earnings. As I get older and make a bigger salary, I will shift more towards pretax since retirees tend to be in a lower tax bracket than where they were in the peak of their career.

If you can max out your 401k, open a Roth IRA which will allow you to invest another $6k/year after taxes and all growth/dividends will be tax free. The downside to this is you’ll have to wait till your 59 years old to touch that money

If you still have money leftover, that is when you can put it in taxable brokerages.

- Dividend yield and growth compared to payout ratio - I associate a higher payout ratio with less room for growth and a greater chance for a dividend cut in the event the company has a bad quarter or year

t3_hsy6og,fydee0l,"To begin, it is awesome that you are so young yet already thinking about retirement. Always good to have your financial goals in mind.

If your plan allows it, I personally would do the following:

1) Check the fine print and see if your 401(k) charges a fee.  Having a 401(k) is not free most of the time, and a recent study found that 2/3 Americans with 401(k) accounts did not know how much they were being charged per year. 9 times out of 10, the company you work for will pay any associated fees, but only as long as you work for the company. When you actually retire, those fees could become your responsibility, so make sure you are factoring that in.

2) You mentioned you could link a brokerage. I would go all in on that. Try to minimize fees as much as possible, considering they will eat away your divideds. A lot of these management services actually still charge commissions on trades, and depending on where you work, you might have to pay those commissions yourself. By linking a commission free brokerage that supports 401(k)s like M1 or Charles Schwab, you can save a lot of money in the long run by cutting those commissions out of your life. Even if your company will pay for the commission, the fine print likely says they will only do that for as long as you work for the company.

t3_htksfx,fyjjlr0,"This might get long, but I wanted to try and give back to your post in feedback the clear amount of work you put into it.

^(I'm a high school economics teacher, not a CFA, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.)

First off, you're right to say that having forty different stocks is an insane amount to have in your portfolio. My rule of thumb is that you should only have as many individual companies in your portfolio that you feel comfortable learning about in-depth and following regularly. If you're someone who can keep up with forty companies, then go for it and enjoy the personal ETF you've crafted. If that's not you (and I assume most people can't or won't put in the work to keep up on all of these companies), you should put the money from these positions into ETFs that will diversify you and ensure that bad picks go by the wayside.

I would even suggest that you drop your list of individual company holdings beyond 20 and move to sector-specific ETFs that hold the underlying companies you were interested in, though others may disagree. It all depends on how in-depth and hands-on you intend to be.

Before I go into your individual holdings, I do want to make a note: be cautious with your gain of 14%. While you're right to celebrate, it is to note that **if you bought in around March 10th-20th, you would basically always be up that much no matter who you bought into** so long as they didn't go out of business (sorry, $HTZ). The measure of your success will come from your long-term performance, and while you should be excited right and riding the high of gains, it's important to understand **why** those gains happened. They exist partially from solid picks, but also because of general market trends that have brought money into the market and created demand, which has driven prices up since the massive dip in March.I understand that going through each of your picks might be a waste of my time if you never read this, OP. I feel a little stupid for spending time writing my rationale for every penny stock you own two shares of, but I feel as though it's solid practice for me to do brief analysis and will be helpful to you as well.

# I have listed these in the order your post goes over them, not in any other order.

Picks that I agree with:  


**$STAG,** solid growth opportunities, and a solid dividend, especially for a REIT!  


**$ABBV,** I love dividend aristocrats. Abbvie has great growth and dividend appreciation opportunities in its future. Great pick here.  


**$K,** Kellog is a staple of consumer life in the US. They're going to be around for a long time, I imagine, and you're right to look at their history as a good sign of future dividend appreciation even if their stock continues to trade sideways as it has.  


**$KDP,** I'm personally a consumer of both Keurig products and Dr. Pepper. That being said, I believe in their brand and potential for growth. With a 35.38 P/E ratio, their price reflects the potential for future growth at well. They're a five-year winner with 138% growth. That all comes in the last 2.5 years, so it's worth a look into why they stagnated between 2016-2018.  


**$KR,** with a massive, nationwide brand, I see Kroger being able to maintain trading sideways and paying out their modest dividend. Keeping this means you believe that they will grow or continue their grow their dividend while never declining. With a payout ratio of 29%, they look very sustainable.  


**$LOW,** great growth potential as I don't see e-commerce having as much success in hardware and gardening as it has in replacing retailers like bookstores, and great dividend history. Solid pick here.  


**$MSFT,** a solid chunk of my portfolio is in Microsoft. I absolutely agree with this.  


**$PNC,** while I believe that there are better-positioned banks currently, PNC has shown itself to be somewhat reliable as it didn't slash its July dividend. That being said, expect that if their price returns to pre-March levels, their dividend yield will become 2.3% again.  


**$SIRI,** with a solid foothold in the car radio market, Sirus has room to grow, especially with their weather, navigation, and other smart features aimed at keeping their customers on the Sirius platform and off their smartphones. As cheap as it is, it might be a good speculation pick.  


**$VZ,** telecom has proven to be a staple in many of the portfolios you'll see on here. Between this and $T, you'd be alright going either way in my opinion. A solid dividend payer for sure.  


**$BRK.B,** not sure what you believe Buffet's reputation to be, but Berkshire has been holding up to their M.O. in the last few months. Typical of a company whose holdings include GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen (i.e. no other company), Berkshire recently bought natural gas infrastructure. Berkshire is meant to be the most diversified single company in existence. It's a conglomerate and when Buffet decides to make another deal, I expect it to be another industry they don't have their foot in, but nothing incredibly crazy. His personal holdings are now almost 50% in Apple Inc., but Berkshire doesn't own a lot of tech firms. Take that as you will.  


**$DIS,** with their grip on US copyright laws firm and showing no signs of letting go, Disney will be a great investment for the future and should continue to make acquisitions of any real competitors. They seem to be acting strangely with park openings lately, but ultimately their media empire is why their stock price is worth anything anyway.

Picks I don't know about:  
**$CARR,** with an IPO in April, it's unclear where Carrier Global will go in the public market. I have $RTX, the company they spun off of, in my portfolio. Definitely adding this to my watchlist.  


**$LUV,** I personally also prefer to fly Southwest when I fly domestically. That being said, you're brave to be in an airline right now and I would say that if you intend to hold this that you pay very close attention to the news around this one in particular as the entire sector is hurting badly.  


**$SFYX,** I'm not incredibly familiar with small-cap companies, but the red-flag I see here is their largest holding is currently cash. I truly think this is too new for me to evaluate.  


**$LVGO,** another new stock that I can't do a ton of analysis on. Their one-year RSI shows that they are currently overbought, but that may adjust if they are able to find resistance at their new price floor. I would advise you to keep an eye on this one.  


**$OSS,** with talk about chip manufacturers making use of their technology, they may be a great pick. They are a speculative pick and I would say that you should be familiar with their product if you intend to hold any significant amount of One Stop Systems.  


**$PINS,** I don't believe that they can break into the same position that Facebook is in. They are not necessarily fighting for market share, however, because many Facebook/Instagram users also have a Pinterest account. They are fighting for screen time and ad time. They may have a great future, but it's too soon to tell and they can be a great tech stock to speculate on.  


**$PTON,** I have no clue what the at-home gym market will look like after the pandemic is over. Based on how new Peloton is, they don't either. Might be a good long position or a good play to end and take profits on now; that's unclear to me.  


**$TMFC,** I would advise that if you wanted an ETF run by financial analysts that you take something with better returns like $ARKW or really anything from the ARK family. Those are actively managed funds which will cost you more in management fees, but the idea is that the extra growth will be worth it.

t3_ht7re0,fyf83ph,"To your last question, it depends on your definition of ""decent."" For most of us, 3-4% annual dividends are decent, and depending on the company -- even good! Looking at $MSFT, their yield is 0.98%, meaning you will see less than 1% of your investment returned to you in dividends a year. But that's assuming that the stock doesn't grow. Over the last five years, $MSFT has increased its price by around \~350%.  


There is no company on the planet that pays 70% dividends annually. You just won't find anything like that.  


For most of us, dividends accompany growth. You shouldn't just chase one or the other and having a mix of well-paying dividend stocks along with stocks that don't grow. For example, I have both $O (a REIT that has paid consistently increasing dividends for a very long time, you'll hear them a lot here) as well as $NET (who pays no dividends at all) in my portfolio. I didn't buy Cloudflare shares thinking they were going to pay me out anything. Instead, I intend to count on their growth as a company moving forward so that my returns will come with their share price increasing.  


If you're looking to see 50% returns on your money, dividends won't cut that for you. But understand that with reward comes risk. Investments that can double your money in the course of a small timeframe come with heavy risk. For every $MSFT, there are dozens of companies that have done horribly and have lost (50%) of their value in the last five years (looking at you, $F.)  


That growth is traded for higher returns in funds like $QYLD where they can promise a 10% dividend yield but basically permanently trade sideways. They disclose this and make it clear that their primary objective is income and not growth. It's up to you what to put your money in, but I would make sure you know what your goals are and what investments you want to make sure to achieve them.  


If you're very young (which is the feeling I get since you said you're a student), then I would absolutely recommend looking at higher growth opportunities. Dividends can be great and you can get a lot of satisfaction out of seeing them DRIP back into your investments, but I caution you against thinking in black and white with your portfolio -- that it has to be all or nothing.

t3_hvfoeo,fytllw6,"I have a healthy mix of monthly and quarterly dividend payers. Typically when looking for anything I'll open up the charts and adjust to 5-yrs. If anything looks like there is any negative decline at all, I won't typically touch it. Next I'll look around for high rated dividend paying ETFs that are 4-6% Yield. Throw in some T to go along with that yield as well. I threw in some high market capital REITs as well to diversify and because I don't mind commercial/hospital/industrial REITs. There are several that aren't going anywhere any time soon. Look into their mortgage portfolio. Next I'll even it out with a little growth ETFs. I have about 3-4 4/5-Morningstar rated. Dividend yield is a tad lower but good growth and will do well with DRIPs. 

&#x200B;

My overall strategy for a period of 12-months before I reevaluate all 4-quarters, monthly and overall year growth/performance/yields/etc to see if what I am doing is working.

\- I have about 35 holdings overall. Payouts are spread throughout the month, throughout the entire year. Right now I'm hitting 1-2 payouts per week or more. 

\- I take the dividends paid, then purchase fraction/whole shares of the next Ex-Div date holding I have. This gives me quicker ""realized gains"" is what you could call it. (\*For instance, if you have a quarterly payer, it DRIPS 1/10th of a share from that payout, well now, you are waiting for 3 months until you get more ""gains"" from that 1/10 investment which during that 3 month period you could purchase more shares of something that will pay out a lot sooner. This way you don't lose out on those ""potential"" payouts for 3 months.

\- After the Ex-div date, I'll move on to the next one. It's almost a round robin strategy. Every holding I have are the holdings that will be good to keep for years and I've hand selected every one of them for this reason. I'm going to do this strategy until I have the amount of shares for each holding so that DRIP will purchase a FULL share on every payout.

\*\*It's almost like a modified ""Dividend Capture"" strategy I guess you could compare it to, but everything I'm buying is something that is actually long term that I want to keep. In a year or 2 I'm going to cull 3-5 riskier holdings and put a little more than normal into my long term low yield/high growth ETFs. Then, I'll reevaluate in 5yrs. I have a few hundred a month to purchase shares so I think this will work for me overall. Once I get to retirement age I'll primarily be supplemental living off high rated growth ETFs and a mix of about 10 quarterly/monthly stocks to get a couple payouts/month.

That scenario is unlikely, so I would say that yes -- you can expect them to grow.

t3_hwg3mr,fyzc523,"Preferred stocks are typically held by executives and large-scale investors in a given company. While some may trade on the open market, most don't. They typically entitle the shareholders to greater cuts of dividends, preference and guarantees on liquidation price, and more votes-per-share during corporate governance events.   


A good example of this is Google. You can be A-series shares, **$GOOGL,** which give you one vote-per-share. You could also buy the typically similarly priced C-series stock, **$GOOG,** but those shares receive no votes-per-share. The founders of Google, however, hold their own stock which isn't publically traded and you cannot buy on the open market, the B-series stock. This entitled them to ten votes-per-share, and they own a ton of it. This allows them to have an incredible weight on corporate governance votes at Alphabet Inc.  


The ticker you're looking for is **$BAC-PL,** and it's publically traded as far as I can tell. I would stay away from preferred shares as a retail investor unless you really know what you're doing and understand what you're entitled to and why you want those things.

Intel is an interesting one, and a company I added to my watch-list a few months ago but haven't made any moves on yet. I don't think delays in their 7nm process is the end of the world for them, although at this point it's obviously a pretty big concern. In the semiconductor space, they're a giant compared to competitors like AMD, and Apple dropping them (phasing them out) really isn't that big of a deal either. Analysts estimate Apple was only about $2b or 3% of their revenue. 

They've spent ~$13b per year on R&D over the past 5 years. For reference that's almost 2x the total revenue AMD brought in last year. Their dividend history is okay, but given their current situation they're actually a company I hope doesn't raise their dividends until they straighten out their manufacturing processes. I think once the issues are finally taken care of they'll be back on top over AMD, although the question remains how much market share AMD can gain over that time and can Intel win any of it back afterwards.

Ultimately they're a somewhat risky play (relatively speaking) but I think they bounce back in a couple years.

The only way you'd get a lower dividend would be if companies held within the ETF cut their dividend or if SPHD adjusted the holding percentages within the ETF which would naturally alter the dividend since the dividend is determined by the underlying holdings.

t3_hwvpug,fz3ov7l,"There’s a few components to your portfolio that I’d like to play devil’s advocate on.

First of all, your communications sector stocks face the potential of serious long-term disruption from StarLink if it’s successfully executed by Elon Musk. T and VZ wouldn’t be able to offer anywhere near the same quality of service as the StarLink program and may see major revenue drop as a result. Of course, this is nowhere near an immediate concern but something to keep in mind going into the future.

Second, I’m going to have to disagree with cutting CVS. I think CVS’s attempts to vertically integrate their business are going to prove successful in the long-run. CVS has been on the decline for the past few years for the same reason as WBA: Declining gross margin on pharmaceutical products (which btw make up a pretty significant portion of each company’s revenue). I believe that by getting into the insurance game CVS will be able to diversify their revenue stream. 

Another risk to CVS/WBA in general is also going to be Amazon. Amazon is looking to get into the pharmaceutical industry as well and they have tendency of wiping the floor with their competitors through aggressive underpricing. Also, Amazon is expanding their distribution and delivery network considerably and many Americans would appreciate the convenience of being able to have their medications delivered to their doorstep without having to walk into a pharmacy.

As for customer service, I've only ever had one occasion to interact with them like that, and it was just to ask a question. It didn't take very long imo to get a response to my question, and I seem to recall that was even on a weekend. In general, I've considered being with them a very smooth and empowering experience.

I have more money now than I've ever had in my life, and I'm not saying I couldn't have similar results with any other brokerage. That's just a matter of what strategy you're going for, and you can do that anywhere. But it's just that that the features M1 offers have made it about as easy as possible to get there.

Really, there's very little else that I might ask for, as far as my needs go. Depending on your investing style / goals, other brokerages might be a better fit (especially if you're day trading and want to buy/sell things at the perfect millisecond). But I'm about dollar cost averaging over decades, and never selling anything if I can avoid it.

I've had enough bad experiences trying to get-rich-quick with market timing. I've just managed to squander thousands of dollars playing that game. The get-rich-slowly method seems WAY more reliable.

I buy more shares at least twice a month, period. My net worth and dividend income keeps increasing every month. And so it will continue over the next couple decades.

Maybe like sphd ko and T and maybe a higher growing stock with consistent dividend like Microsoft or Apple even though its only around 1% yield. Studies show that once you hit the 20 stock mark further diversification after that doesn't affect the risk aversion and even can minimize your returns by missing out on single stock large gains.

Since it's such a a small account there isn't going to be any meaningful passive income stream for a while. So  If I was dropping 2500 into a fresh account here's how I would do it. First I wouldn't spend all 2500 at once I would split it up into 5 months putting in 500 at the first of each month. And then what ever contributions I want to make after that. I would do some research and pick 3-5 stocks I want to own forever. I would probably go heavier weighted on sphd maybe 30% if I have 5 stocks. And then spread it out after that.

of course, this is an over simplified viewpoint of things as it narrowly focuses on return and ignores the possibility of dividend stocks also having growth in share value. other than that, the  only other thing to keep in mind is that just because various companies have the same payouts today doesn't mean that 5 years from now they will all increase their dividends at the same rate.

I like to diversify my portfolio with different sectors and to have a few different companies for each sector. I try to keep my sector allocation under 20% of my portfolio just to help the balance. 

Look at companies with increasing revenue and earnings year over year. Also look at companies that tend to have increased free cash flow. Given the current crisis I wouldn’t hold Covid 19 against any  company that had a decrease in earnings / revenue / free cash flow in 2020. 

Personally I would not invest in a company that suspended / cut their dividend durning this pandemic. I understand that companies were pretty much forced to shut down however as an investor I want to ensure that my passive income is continued regardless of this pandemic or future ones. Take JNJ they increased their dividend in 2020. You want companies that are able to weather any storm.

I would suggest adding a small allocation to tech companies that pay a small increasing dividend. Apple had almost 200 billion on hand and has been increasing their dividend 10% year over year.

I am branching out though. Seeing other ""popular"" dividend stocks (such as Reality Income) and feel that I should at least have some sort of stake in them.

t3_hzjyot,fzjj8g9,"A few pieces of advice to consider:

1. In regards to investing in individual stocks for dividends, you have the right idea. Some people will argue that ETFs are superior. This is only true if you have limited investing knowledge and just want to forget about your portfolio until you retire. ETFs charge a fee, and this will hamper your ability to earn compound interest.

2. Use a free brokerage that doesn't charge commissions and allows you to dollar cost average. This is 2020, you don't need to pay to trade stocks. 

3. Compound interest is your best friend. You want to plow every single cent of dividends back into your portfolio. Warren Buffet has earned over $100billion over the course of his life. 99% of that money was earned after he turned 56.  The power of compounding is not something to be taken lightly.

4. Pick good quality companies. Don't chase yield. Don't pick a company with a higher yield than T.",14,1595963556.0

Forget monthly payers. Choose good companies with a track record of consistent dividend increases. Since companies pay in different quarters, you’ll get the effect of monthly payouts without limiting your selections. 

Play with a dividend portfolio calculator and you’ll find that dividend increase percentage matters more than the dividend yield percentage. You’ll also find it’ll take about 20yrs of consistent investing before your dividend payouts become significant (as in 2nd income significant). But once that occurs you’ll be financially unstoppable.

1: Company is paying out more than it earned in the last 12 months, this can come from savings or debt (generally unsustainable).  
2: Profits maybe don't give the full picture (Reits for example), and the dividend is basically paid out from cashflow (you can have good a cashflow and bad profits and vice versa)/

Depreciation is one for example, many companies with a lot of equipment and property will have higher depreciation and amortization. Goodwill impairment is similar to depreciation in that it's not a real expense. Acquisitions are something that can impact EPS as well, but companies usually finance these and pay for them over time. As with acquisitions, there are other nonrecurring expenses that will impact a company's EPS, such as severance and pension payouts, dispositions, and fines.

t3_hzcoqp,fziy1q1,"You are posting to a dividend subreddit, so I’m going to assume you are interested in building a solid dividend growth portfolio. You framed a question in a way that seems like your primary concern is capital gains not dividend growth. For dividend portfolios, your primary care should be finding companies so solid that they will NEVER cut their dividend, no matter what the market does. Case in point, JNJ, which actually increased their dividend during COVID-19. 

With companies like that, it doesn’t matter if the stock price is cut in half for a while. The reason is, if you are reinvesting the dividends, each dividend just buys you twice as much stock now. But here is the real kicker. If the company is so solid it is able to increase the dividend during a correction, the share price won’t drop as much as the rest of the market, since investors will flee to its safe payouts. 

Basically, quit worrying about what the market will do, and start building a portfolio of legendary companies the world cannot do without. Invest a set amount every month (dollar cost averaging, DCA), and relax knowing your portfolio will compound through good times and bad.

When I was young, I chased yields until I finally figured out that getting rich slowly was much faster than trying to get rich quickly.  Unlike OP, I make $30,000 in dividends a year but my average is 4% and my portfolio is up over the past 12 months.

That being said, I've owned OHI for many years, and used to own NMFC; that just didn't move too much value wise, but was a steady payer, I just shifted to more of a DGI model and sold.

There is a lot more that is at play and ignoring that for these firms could be dangerous for this theoretical ETFs returns.  


The other issue that comes with this is that you would have to attract investors with this idea.

don't forget, in many cases the ""high yield"" stocks are simply just inflated percentages because the share price has fallen so much due to the pandemic. this means there's a higher risk that the dividend gets cut/eliminated (though to be fair, this far out from the initial crash you're probably not likely to see too much dividend adjustment, now you just have to worry about actual bankruptcies)

when i built my dividend portfolio in march, i focused on companies that were likely to be stable for the long term even if there were some short term pains (pepsi, wells fargo, exxon mobile, disney, iron mountain, att) in the short term, disney didn't do so great on the dividend front (but did great on the share price front, with the shares going from the sub $100 price  point i bought at up to the current $130 price point). WFC started strong, but then the fed stepped in and forced them to slash their dividend. the rest have been unphased.

once i had my core portfolio set up, THEN i started looking into the high yield stuff that was a bit more of a question mark. one of the big things i was looking at was the prior share price to make sure

1. the dividend has been paying out for a long time
2. the share price has been relatively consistent and it's not down big from pre-pandemic or trending downward over the years, constantly losing value.

Like foods, companies in a portfolio should compliment each other. That way you can build a portfolio capable of withstanding any challenge. 

With that being said, here are a few picks from my personal portfolio of 40+ companies I hold.  These are just some personal holdings to help diversify your portfolio when you are financially able.  Don't take this as a solicitation to buy, just simply as a jumping off point. 

1: Stanley Black and Decker (SWK).

A strong industrial stock with years of dividend hikes under its belt. High quality products trusted by dads and craftsman the world over. Not to mention the countless products they offer. The 21st century and the rise of the internet tutorial has seen a massive surge in interest in DIY projects. Any company that manufactures tools stands to benefit a great deal, especially those whose products bear a ""Made in the USA"" label.

2: Hormel Foods (HRL)

If you live in the United States and shop at a grocery store other than Whole Foods, there is statistically a good chance you have a product produced by Hormel sitting either in your fridge, pantry, or next grocery list right now. While this company is best known for SPAM, the reality is that this is an incredibly well diversified food manufacturer who next year will celebrate their 130th anniversary. I know they will live to see that anniversary because covid is barely registering on this company's radar at the moment. With [dozens of food brands](https://www.hormelfoods.com/brands/?group=all) under their name, the company is well diversified to weather any fads in consumer food spending. Not to mention the market dominance of several company brands like Skippy Peanut Butter and Hormel Pepperoni.

Hormel is a trusted name, even amongst the ecologically conscious. The company is committed to making its products in as environmentally friendly way as possible, which means they are well positioned to survive as Gen Z (who has made it clear they care very much about the environment) develops spending power and begins buying groceries.

For those of you heartless types though who only care about numbers. Hormel has a 52 year dividend growth streak, 16% average 5y growth rate, payout ratio of 56%, and the stock price has increased by 400% over the past ten years. What more do you want them to do? 

3: Stock Yards Bancorp

A well run regional bank based out of Louisville, Kentucky. That's all it is. The dividend [has never been cut](https://www.snl.com/IRW/Dividend/100548) in company history. Payout ratio is good, the bank is growing in a sustainable manner. It doesn't need to be a Mega company to deliver a good return to the few shareholders it does have. We Kentuckians just know how to run a business (Papa John was from Indiana before any memesters try to bring him up.)

This company is so boring nobody has cared enough to actually make this company a Wikipedia page. It is so boring my brokerage does not even have the company's logo show up when i look at the stock. It just has the ticker symbol SYBT as its image. This is a snoozefest of a company media wise. Perfect for an investor looking for a bargain. This company is so well run its price recovered faster than any of the big banks, and is currently beating Q2 revenue estimates. This company is destined to become a major player in the roads less travelled in the US. Hell, give it enough time and it could likely dethrone a banking titan. After all, this company has the best management I have ever seen of any bank ever. Either way, its not going anywhere.

4: Microsoft.

A bit cliche, but a true dividend payer. Well diversified with significant room to grow. This TikTok thing is just a drop in the bucket to them long term. Even if the deal goes up in smoke, Microsoft will still be just fine.

Its 11:40 at night and I have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to call it quits here. [This is my portfolio. ](https://m1.finance/5pfRVMQqi84h)I could sit here all day and recommend every single company in this portfolio, but I won't.

t3_i6cl97,g0wj63j,"I personally hold **$KO** in my portfolio and I really believe in Coke as a company. If you're trying to move into it because of the dividends, you may want to check out dividend-focused ETFs like **$SPHD, $SCHD, $VYM, $VIG,** or **$DGRO.** You could always find a basket of dividend aristocrats (S&P 500 companies who have paid increasing dividends for 25 years straight) like **$NOBL** if you're interested in large-cap companies offering dividends.  


That being said, you may also want to look at something that offers that level of income you're looking for but also diversifies you. I don't know what else is in your portfolio, but for dividends, it's hard to wrong with some of your portfolio being exposed to real estate. Something like **$VNQ** (a REIT ETF) would be great. Alternatives to that are **$SCHH** and **$REET**, they all expose to markets differently. I recommend **$VNQ** because it includes telecom REITS (which Schwab's fund doesn't) and it focuses on US equities (REET is multinational).",4,1596989994.0

Right now, you are at about 3.6% yield on cost, which is good but I think you can reasonably target a 5% yield without taking on too much additional risk.  I think reallocating a bit and adding a few higher yielding positions can help.   For example, (a) you can halve your position in MSFT (currently yielding shy of 1%) and, if you are looking for value, add a higher yielding position in the materials sector (check out LYB or EMN) and (b) similarly, you can shed or downsize some of the lower yielding techs and, if your goal is yield, replace them with some good REITs, energy stocks, and maybe a BDC; to take one position at random, ADP - it seems expensive (currently 27x forward earnings) and yields less than 3%; perhaps replace it with a quality underpriced REIT yielding north of 5% (to take 2 names from my portfolio: SLG or BXMT), or check out MAIN or EPD.

t3_i7h3mv,g13txhg,"Here is my advice from 40 years of investing.

The fastest way to get rich quickly is to do it slowly.  What does that mean?  It means buy good solid companies like Microsoft, Apple, Pfizer.  These are companies with solid financials, steady growth, a fair to middling dividend and they will be around in 40 more years.  

Stay away from the fads, the reddit du jour stocks like weed stocks and high yield traps.  The stock that pays you 14% is also likely to lose you 25% of your principal in the same time.  It's math, you pay for the yield somehow.  

The dividend yield is the last number you should look at.  Way more important are the revenues, profits and growth of the same.  Know what the company makes, sells, delivers before you buy it.  Buy what you know or think you know not what the crowd is purchasing.

Take advantage of bad news.  My favorite day of the week is when earnings disappoint.  Take for instance MMM.  MMM has been on my want list since I sold it last.  I love the company, I have owned it 3 times and made money each time.  Several weeks ago MMM disappointed at earnings and dropped from $163 to $154, I bought 100 shares,  the drop continued to $149 so I bought another 100 shares.  When it started to rise again, I bought another 135 shares.  Guess where MMM is today, higher than it was when it disappointed.  I used the drop to build a position that is already up $4k and now my 2nd largest holding.  

Don't be afraid to take profits but also don't be afraid to let some ride.  In my experience when you pick a BIG winner take some profit and let the rest ride.  I bought FB when the IPO crashed and burned (see bad news).  The IPO price was $38 a share, several days later, it could be had for 1/2 of that, I bought 575 shares.  When it had quadrupled I sold off enough to cover my initial investment and let the rest ride.  By selling enough to cover my investment, I eliminated the stress of volatility.  

It is far better to buy 57 shares of 1 stock than 1 share of 57 stocks.  I see noob portfolios on here all day, every day that consist of $5000 divided up into 37 different holdings, mostly of 1 share each.  That will get you nowhere really fast.  Instead pick 1 company, build a position and then and only then buy stock #2.  Scattering your limited assets all over the NASDAQ because you are afraid of missing out, means that you will miss out.  Instead concentrate on 1 stock that you believe in and be patient.  My portfolio is $3/4M and I only own 27 stocks.  But I also own a S&P 500 index fund.  If you want diversification buy mutual funds. 

Never stop reading.  Just because you picked wisely or luckily once, twice or three times doesn't make you an expert.  It means you're lucky.  But everyone is an expert in a rising market.  It is those who make money in falling markets who are the smart ones.  

Good luck, you're ahead of the game starting early, don't get behind by playing penny stocks, commodities or high yield junk.

t3_i7h3mv,g123a3y,"Here is some basic advice.  Just keep in mind, nothing here is exclusive.  You can mix and match anything, and nothing is 100% one category.  It's always a blend.

* Decide what you want to become:  Do you want to be an investor or a trader?
   * Investors tend to buy and hold.  Playing the long game (10+ years).
   * Traders play the short game.
      * There are day traders and swing traders.  Day traders make several plays each day, and usually don't hold anything into the next trading day.  Swing traders hold longer term looking for the deals.
* If you want to be an investor, what kind of investor.
   * Dividend and Growth are the two big basic choices.
* What your goals are with it.
   * Retirement?  Look into Roth IRAs or the equivalent.
   * Steady ""passive"" income?
   * Something better than a savings account or MMA (Money Management Account), where you can pull money from when you need it?
* What fields are you familiar with?  What are you interested in?  What do you believe in?
   * Whatever stock sector you plan on investing in, try to stick to what you know and are willing to do research on.  Think of it as buying a car.  Do your research on the car, the company, and everything concerning it before you put your money into it.  Does the car look good, but it's unreliable and prone to breakdowns?  Maybe put your money into getting something else.  Oh wait, the car looks and runs well?  And has a history to back that up?  But the company is about to declare bankruptcy, so support is going away...
* Watch videos and look at sites like [SeekingAlpha](https://seekingalpha.com/).  But always take everything with a grain a salt and do your own research.  Just because your favorite youtuber/streamer is talking about Company A a lot doesn't mean it's a good company to invest in.  Everyone has a bias.
* Consider your investment money as disposable money.  If you can't afford to lose your money, then don't use your money.  Don't put your rent money into it when you need to pay your rent tomorrow.  You only get paid out usually under two conditions:  Dividend payments or you sell your position.  Everything until then is imaginary.  This the difference between unrealized gains and realized gains.
* Read a lot.  Take a look at different portfolios from this sub and others.  There is no shame in copying others and using what you like and disposing what you don't like.  Back up your choices with your own research.",2,1597110024.0
t3_i8omq7,g1ac52j,"At age 42, your annual contribution limit is $6,000, and that would limit the growth in your portfolio and the dividends. So, you’ll need to aggressively fund that portfolio. Dividend investing makes sense when you can grow it without regulatory limits. The more money you invest, the more shares you have, and the more dividends (assuming the company’s growth and profitability continues to rise). I wouldn’t do an IRA for dividend investing at age 42 (I’m 44). If you can’t afford to put in more than $6,000 yearly, then do an IRA.

t3_i8g07h,g184xcb,"When it comes to dividends, there are 4 dates to keep in mind: the declaration date, the ex-dividend date, the record date, and the payment date.

The declaration date is what your question in partially about: this is the date said company announces that they will be paying a dividend, how much that dividend is ($), and - to answer your question - the payout ratio (%).

As for possible changes, yes a company may decide at any moment either increase or decrease the amount and ratio of the dividend payout, or scrap it and stop paying dividends altogether. This decision is based on many factors (company's sector, wellbeing, overall philosophy,...). So you could say that a company may increase their dividend if they're in a good position, or vice versa, but it remains speculative, you can't predict it with pinpoint accuracy.

Example: AGNC Investment Corp. Common Stock has been decreasing their dividends over the past few years because they're going to stop paying dividends in the future ([Source](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/agnc/dividend-history))

This is where you start to hear the terms ""dividend aristocrats"" and ""dividend kings"" (which you should look into if you're interested in dividend investing).

My dad helped me set up a stock portfolio through a broker. 

Everyone told me to take big risks because I was young. This was all in the lead up to the internet bubble of the late 90’s/early 2000’s. 

People told me to invest in Sears and GE because they were so well established and would always be around. I was also told that AOL and Blockbuster were up and coming so I should have big positions in those, you know, for the long term growth prospects they both had.

If to say another crash occurs, a growth stock may take some time to recover, which could be money shorted for retirement while a dividend paying company or ETF may be more stable and continue to pay out. Even though our current recovery is coming along nicely, the next crash would be financial problems due coronavirus, which may take longer to recover.

I have experimented a lot with dividend investing and stock buying in general.

Pros: 

- Setting target allocations by percentage, so you don't have to do any math. If you want Apple to make up 10% of your portfolio, set it to be 10% and you are done.

- Dollar cost averaging is automatic (if you turn on auto-invest), eliminating the need to actively monitor your portfolio every day.

- Free to use, with a premium option available if you want more perks.

- Margin trading for those who want it.

- Designed intentionally for dividend investors with them in mind.

- Good customer service (at least in my experience).

- Supports fractional shares. Will make purchases as small as $1.

- The pies effectively allow one to build their own fee-free ETF. 

- Easy to share portfolios with others.

- No commissions on anything (some brokerages still have those).

- Free to use prebuilt portfolios for those with zero investing experience. 

- Premium not necessary for a good experience.

Granted, it will be smaller...a portfolio that pays $40 a month will end up being about $480 a year, which will incur about $60 a year or so in taxes, if non of those investments were qualified.

t3_iczwsp,g2b79bd,"This is an excellent question. In my opinion it is always better to take the cash. Generally speaking for small investors (i.e. most individuals here) you are not doing yourself any favors by reinvesting. The reason is because your theoretical goal is to start a meaningful and material *but limited* cash output that doesn't really gain from small and often arbitrary amounts. I'll refer to this as the Netflix Effect Mindset:

Let's say you have a 12% {which is *very* high} stable yield and wish to pay for Netflix with a dividend payment and that Netflix is 13/mo. You buy 110 shares of XYZ @ $10.00 which yields 13.20 per month but costs you $1,100.00 upfront. So, first, let's look at both the ROI and the rationality.

The ROI would be, in period 1, 13.20/1,100 or 1.2%. Thanks to not very fancy math we can convert this into time; it would take 83 months, or 6.9 *years* to make your money back if all you did was just rely on that return alone. One would argue that this would be reduced by the DRIP but unfortunately if you make such a table it reduces it by less than two months. The rate by which you compound matters here far more than other places because you have no control over the dividend payout schedule (time).

The rationality is that you're buying the asset with this target goal in mind. So, for $1,100 upfront you could buy, if Netflix did not change price, 7 years worth of the service. This is *important* because that means that your plan is to use a fungible investment return on something that is fixed as a cost. This also suggests that taking the cash is the only thing that makes sense; the prospective risk associated with the stock is significantly higher than the return (read as: you can lose more than $13.20 in a month on the investment itself) and, given it is pre-allocated, there's no reason to deviate.

This is one of the reasons people suggest not buying stocks for their dividends; I used 12% but many portfolios have less than 5%, so factoring in time, the ROI of the dividend, not the underlying, is usually 25+ years. Time risk is the main risk in any dividend based strategy; for instance if you dripped your returns this year and your stock fell you likely lost more than the whole of your reinvestment; however if you held it as cash, even if unallocated, you could seek returns elsewhere or take advantage of opportunities for higher returns.

Basically if you don't need the money, do invest it, but don't reinvest it to earn .01 on the dollar (and that's the high end). That's just silly.

TL;DR: If you have a $100 dividend a month you'll have an easier time turning it, even at the lowest levels of positive returns, into more cash than you would trying to use a DRiP.",2,1598003537.0

There are inherent risks involving individual stocks, but it's often met with subsequent reward. Sure I don't expect every individual pick to be a homerun, but the ones that are will benefit me far more than if they were just included in an ETF. 

ETFs are great because they are generally built with some sort of diversification in mind, be it by sector, industry, or intention (growth/dividend). If you're someone who is genuinely interested in learning the intricacies of a particular business and how to understand the accounting and other horse shit that goes with it I would say individual stocks are definitely valuable in that regard.

If you want to factor tilt for higher long term returns then Throw in VOOV or VOOG (But NOT BOTH that defeats the purpose) to compliment VTI.  Value has historically outperformed growth but the last decade value has had poor performance compared to growth So tilt towards whichever you want to bet on.

t3_idn2ro,g2a5e5o,"It’s not too late at all, don’t worry. Contribute to an IRA (up to 6,000 per year) and if your company has a 401k matching contribution plan then start doing that and at least match the company’s input, or put in more if you comfortably can. 

I would recommend you look carefully at ETFs (exchange traded funds) for your IRA and invest in a few good ones. This simplifies the process for you so you don’t have to study hundreds of companies by yourself. You can pick an ETF by what matches your strategy. If you want to get paid dividends you can get something like SPHD, SPYD, or NOBL. If you want to invest in technology you can buy QQQ, FTEC, ARKK etc. If you want healthcare you can invest in FHLC or something similar, and so on. If you just want to follow the whole US stock market you can buy something like VTI. Some quick google searches will show you plenty of other options. 

For your 401k I recommend buying into a target date mutual fund. In your case it might be a 2055 fund which attempts to invest so you can retire in the year 2055 or whatever target date you choose. These are good because they buy and sell stocks inside the fund without you having to figure it out yourself. They usually pay dividends that get reinvested back into it and it snowballs over time. I’ve have had some target date mutual funds for many years and they have really snowballed over the years and the best part was that I didn’t need to do any research on them. That’s why they charge a small fee to pay the people who do all the work for you. 

My father didn’t really start investing until he was like 40 and even then it took him some years to figure it all out. Eventually, he maxed out all his contributions every year and he invested in some good funds and he did just fine by the time he was in his late 60’s.

t3_ieog73,g2jrpzx,"I chose qualified dividends only for my taxable account because it was just easier for me to deal with, and I wanted every dollar possible going towards compounding interest. On top of that, because I make less than $40k a year and likely will for some time, my qualified dividends means I pay absolutely nothing in tax as long as I hold them. That being said, if you make less than like $40k a year it's not too bad. For instance, I originally had a REIT that paid me $48 a year for 20 shares...my taxable amount on that would have been around $5 a year, which is a totally fine trade off.   


As the qualified dividends guy I gotta recommend SCHD. I don't have it in my portfolio, but only because I also have set my portfolio to DRIP and my broker doesn't yet allow me to DRIP SCHD, so I have it's more expensive, slightly worse cousin, VIG. If at some point SCHD becomes fractional/DRIPable to me then I am switching my VIG investment over. Lots of people love O, and with good reason, but if I just had money to throw at an investment once in awhile I would throw it into a market ETF so that you don't have to pay much attention to what's going on.

It is possible to reinvest dividends for 30+ years and live off a portfolio and retire, but you have to know how much your cost of living is and grow your portfolio to that point.

I also have a brokerage account. I have growth stocks as well as dividend stocks in my brokerage account. While it would be nice to make a few thousand or more a month or quarter from dividends, I'm not shooting for that goal just yet.

Once I'm to that goal, I plan to expand. Next will be making sure my monthly rent(or mortgage in the future) is covered.

As far as dividends, check out the Dividend Aristocrats. This will be dividend paying stocks that have consistently increased their dividend payouts for 25 years or more. These will be safe and stable investments.

As far as investing, finding and picking a solid ETF will never go wrong for you. Saving and investing into an ETF and holding long term will always be safe, strong, and simple way to invest. You can simply buy more and more of the ETF and basically forget about it. Check back in 20 years and see the gains. 

You can also look to stocks for investing. Individual stocks are riskier and less stable compared to ETFs, but they also provide the potential for higher gains. If you buy individual stocks, just be prepared to be more hands on with your investing. You will need to follow the companies and watch how things are going. 

Avoid daytrading, penny stocks, and options. These will all likely lose you money unless you really have spent time learning and are prepared. Then you will still likely lose money until you get the experience.

t3_iizy2t,g3dtlz3,"> I keep reading dividend is stupid in a taxable account 

For dividends in a taxable account, *the type* of dividend distribution is important to factor in.

In $QYLD's case, dividends are primarily return of capital (ROC), which is not taxed as income and instead reduces your cost basis. Say you bought 100 shares for $20. A monthly distribution of $0.20 per share is issued and looking up the 19A it is 100% ROC. Instead of paying income tax on $20, the dividend instead reduces your cost basis of the shares which would now be $19.80 per share. You realize no tax until you would sell the shares, ideally down the line at a favorable long term capital gains rate.

For funds that issue ROC dividends, it is important to pay attention to the funds net asset value (NAV) since it directly relates to share price. Constantly eroding NAV (through outsized dividend payouts) leads to constantly lower share price over time. This is why most people recommend to not chase yield since in most cases it's a trap at the expense of share price. In $QYLD's case however, they have actually grown NAV about 7.5% yearly on average. It lags the index it tracks, but positive NAV growth is still always good to see with such high yields.

Most option writing funds have similar ROC classification on their dividends, but most people don't seem to dig into those details........

\-Information for reference on the historic distributions:

[https://www.globalxetfs.com/tax-supplements/#qyld](https://www.globalxetfs.com/tax-supplements/#qyld)

 TL;DR: $QYLD is actually better in a taxable account over a retirement account because of ROC dividends.",11,1598813112.0

I think it's stupid to invest in stocks on margin no matter what it is. It's like combining credit cards and the stock market. Horrifying idea, frankly. There's no need for margin if you have thousands to invest. Why be super greedy?

Using QYLD as a very high yield ""savings account?"" That... is a bit more worthy of discussion. Effectively you get back around 1% of capital a month (minus taxes but savings interest is taxed too), which is far better than any actual savings account. Tech is still doing well and the nature of QYLD has downside protections, at least right now. 

Long term? Risky. Short term? I think you could try it. The price action on QYLD is very minimal compared to every other stock I hold. It varies just a few cents up or down a day. Like ten or twelve cents, if that. Trending upward nevertheless.

That said, SPHD, a similar-in-idea low volatility ETF (it was not based on options) tracking the S&P was used as a faux high yield savings account by some people and it's still quite down from before the covid crash. I invested in them post-crash so I'm okay but anyone holding it before that occurred is still down. The same could happen to QYLD, I suppose.

If you put 30k in QYLD, earned 1%, then sold everything in a month you'd likely be pleasantly surprised. It's certainly an interesting ETF.

Edit: JEPI is a newer, similar fund based on a different sector. Managed by JP Morgan. Lower yield. Could be safer. QYLD, after all, is pronounced as ""killed,"" for what it's worth.",5,1598764615.0

Edit: but if it does, it will go somewhere predictable!

Lots of really decent higher yielding stocks are discounted though. If their longer term models are sustainable then buy them. REITs for more industrial operations seem fine. Some of them wound up beating the S&P in terms of CAGR over time when real estate stocks were villified. Defensive stocks will almost certain return so if you've researched the risk of bankruptcy on companies then go for it.

First, yield is important but [Yield on Cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield-on-cost.asp) becomes more interesting after you hold the stock for a while. Suppose your stock increases in price but the dividend yield you once found attractive is now much lower - you have to recognize that you're still getting paid at the rate you found attractive when you bought. 

Second, most people forget about the Dividend Growth Rate, that is how quickly your stock increases it's dividend. 

Imagine a company that not only pays you money but pays you more money each year that you own it. Companies that do this are called [Dividend Aristocrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Dividend_Aristocrats). 

Finally, as you approach retirement you want income - in the form of interest and dividends - and to protect your nest egg. All the dividend aristocrats are larger, stable companies. Still have to keep your eye on them though (eg, GE). 

In short, if you want low risk, good yield dividend stocks are the way to go. If you're young and are years away from retirement you can take on more risk and go for growth stocks.

I would not invest in individual companies you don't know about and don't have the time to keep up with regarding news, corporate decisions, etc.  


That's where these mutual funds and ETFs come in. There is no problem at all with throwing everything into your existing index funds. It's safer for the returns you'll see (it's not about raw gains, it's about risk-adjusted returns) and you'll likely to avoid pitfalls, value traps, and putting your money into companies that may not grow in the future like they have in the past.  


I'm not here to shit on Apple or Microsoft. I have a personal position in $MSFT. What I'm saying is that you better hope you're right. If you asked anybody in the US in 1995 what the biggest tech company would be in the future, I bet you they would've told you with a lot of certainty, *America Online.* Where is AOL now?  


But anybody in 1995 that had invested in a broader fund like the S&P 500 or the total market would be doing just fine right now. Yes, they would've had greater gains if they had been invested in Apple or Microsoft, but that's because those are the companies who survived. Not everybody did.  


The other piece of advice I have to give is please, please, please put this in a Roth IRA or other retirement account. I don't know what kind of account this is, but putting your investments funds in a tax advantaged account will amplify any gains you do see compared to a taxable brokerage account.

t3_ikflmy,g3kf48u,"I was in the very same position as you are now a year ago. Had 2.500 Euro to start my portfolio and was very determined to find good companies to invest that money in (starting the journey off on a good foot).
What I ended up doing was watching a whole lot of yt creators that are in the space of dividend investing and from that compiled my own spreadsheet where I simply pull massive amounts of financial data on companies that are interesting to me and then comparing them against each other (on the their data and indicators) to make a more....""informed"" decision. 

The channels that I would recommend for this type of stuff is 
- Joseph Carlson (really love his content. Watch it religiously every week)
- GenXDividendinvestor 
- Matt Money

This might not be the answer you are hoping for but I thing diving into or at least scratching the surface of what metrics to look at, how to compare companies, what red flags are etc is hugely valuable especially at the beginning. At really you should use the momentum of interest and ""eagerness"" to learn about it because it will fade away after a while and then you might be too lazy to invest the effort. 

And as on a final note - everyone has different goals (okay maybe not THAT different since we are all here for some passive income, but our interests are different). Me for example - I don't invest in tabacco companies (i.e. MO), but others might because of the high yield. Some are fine with a 4% yield, but I am shooting a bit higher since I need to make up for the taxes that are deducted from the dividends I receive. Just as examples. 

And if you really just want recommendations for a specific company. Go for the evergreens, with those you cannot be wrong. As an example this could be:
KO
T
O
JNJ

 > Unlike most REITs, which invest in properties and rent them out, AGNC buys securities, specifically mortgage-backed securities, which are guaranteed by the U.S. government.

 > The mortgage REIT sector was put through the wringer early in the COVID-19 crisis as credit dried up, and many REITs were forced to unload assets at fire-sale prices. Every mortgage REIT cut its dividend and reported a significant drop in book value per share. Some eliminated the dividend completely.

 > AGNC management mentioned on its second quarter earnings call that, in hindsight, AGNC probably didn't need to cut the dividend from $0.15 a month to $0.12 a month. The crisis for the mortgage REIT sector may not be over, but while most have completely changed their business models, AGNC survived the crisis without being forced to do that. ANGC Investment's 10% dividend yield is attractive enough, but the stock also trades at a 6% discount to its book value of $14.92. Since mortgage REITs generally trade right around book value, this is a second source of potential return, which gives AGNC potential as a value stock as well as a dividend stock.

If you're looking for decent monthly payers; $DGRW $O $PEY $SPLV - If you look at the previous 5yr performance, and you add in the dividend yield you'll find these are superior to $SPHD - I ended up dropping my $SPHD and exchanging it for $PEY. $SPHD ended up getting hit a lot harder than what they claimed as a low volitility. Their holdings are so-so for the top 10% as well. It also has a low growth rate compared to the other 4 I listed. $O is one of the best holdings and because it's an individual stock, it does not have a fee (Expense Ratio).

If you want 2x cheap monthly holdings with decent growth potential and high ratings; I would highly suggest $DGRW & $O.  


\*To add to your other part. If you are looking for long term investing, I would go a little lower on the dividend outlook and look more into growth ETFs. You can still get dividends but don't get too focused on dividend output. You'll end up losing out on a lot of growth that would far outweigh the dividend yield+growth of pure dividend stocks. I have a mix of both and it works pretty well for exposure and growth and dividends. Check out things like $SMH $FTEC $PBW $IWY $JPM $VUG & market size ETFs like $DIA $VTI $SPY. All these give dividends but their growth far outweigh anything you'll find with 4-6% dividends. Also, to note most monthly dividend payers are good for income style. So, unless you want to live off of those, put more weight into growing your portfolio instead of focusing on dollar payout amount. In the future you can use that growth to sell holdings and buy strong income holdings.",10,1599477799.0

t3_io4sol,g4bmmbs,"I always suggest ETFs for dividends because of relative safety vs an individual company. Or REITs.

Secondly, ETFs or stocks that cost close to $300 / share and pay only $0.30 do not make sense for a dividend play. You want to maximize your pay per share, so getting a solid ETF or REIT for $30-60, which pays $0.20 a share makes a helluva lot more sense to me.

When you deal with ETFs you typically do not see huge growth as opposed to individual stocks, but you are also hedged against a single company failing. For example ARKK, which offers Tesla as one of its top holdings, grew significantly this year. But not close enough to TSLA alone.
However when things turn around for TSLA, because what goes up must come down, ARKK is likely to lose a lot less. Unless the whole sector collapses.

PEY doesn't look good to me at only $0.06 / share and a hefty expense ratio. SPHD already tracks solid payers. SPLV is ok, but if you are after monthly consider the following spread..

SPHD - s&p exposure
O / MAIN - real estate exposure


Personally, I don't think going specifically after monthly dividends is necessary, as you are limited to a certain subset of investments, quarterly will pay just as much if not more per year and you have access to solid ones, like
IDV (over PEY) for int'l exposure. Or SCHD.

If you must look for monthly consider other REITs or GAIN, which looks a little better to me than PEY.

Total returns usually include drip compounding...

security?
starting amount?
security growth projection? Annually %
dividend growth projection? Annually %
annual dividend yield?
number of dividend payments per year?
do you plan to make contributions per year?
capital/dividend gains tax % ?
years before taking profit?
drip assumed 

There are online tools that can help you. Your example of SPY actually has an ""ok"" dividend yield of 1.6%. Therefore you have to include all the dividend income here as well.
Actually SPY usa very solid dividend fund.

Here's a good calculator (not mine):

Basically don't look at any number in isolation, do the calculation for your criteria.

Part 2 is to look at fundamentals.

ETFs are naturally more safe than stocks because of diversified holdings.
Multiple ETFs in various industries and counties help to diversify further. 
Do not go crazy as each holding requires some research and commitment.
How's the historical performance?
Do you believe in what you are investing?
How do you see it growing or at least not disappearing before you take profit?
Do you understand the investment? i.e. if you know nothing about goat milk, but you heard it was good for you, would you put $X of your money into goat milk?

t3_iphhi3,g4k2vxv,"You have $PBA in both your REIT and Energy slices, so you might want to change that allocation.

If you wanted to trim your diversification down, you might want to look at your holdings, their historical trends, future outlook, your knowledge about the industry, and finally your faith in it performing well in the future.  imo, a downward trending stock is a bad sign.  If it isn't growing, it's dying.  But that's just my own view.

However diversification isn't bad either.  For example, if you had a diversified account in 1997 and only managed to buy 1 share of $AMZN (Amazon) at $18 among the rest of your portfolio, that 1 share would amount to nearly $40k right now.  Sure you could also say you could have done 100% investment into $AMZN at the time, but just as likely you could have had 100% investment into $ENE (Enron).",10,1599667374.0

That 10% has been down, but it’s ok because that’s what it’s there for. Since I like researching the stock market, it gives me the opportunity to learn more and discover what kind of investor I am.

t3_iphhi3,g4ljqrm,"21 shares definitely isn't too diversified. 20ish was my target when i started my portfolio back in march. (dividend focused, but at the end of the day a mix of dividend and growth)

worth mentioning, over-diversification is going to be more of a problem for a growth stock based strategy than it would be with dividend stocks. this is because when you have a growth based strategy, you're spreading your money more ways and if one company hits it big, you're not going to have much in there if you're too over diversified. with a growth strategy, you're earning your money by the shares appreciating in value so you want as much as possible in the companies that do hit and the hope is that the hits outweigh the misses.

on the dividend side, that risk doesn't really apply. your gains aren't going to come from a company hitting it big, it's going to come from your companies continuing to exist and pay out consistently. being spread thinner is arguably a good thing because it minimizes how much of a hit you take if one company slashes their payout (like many companies did this year). since a dividend strategy isn't going to see the next tesla where one of your holdings shoots through the roof, you're not going to be passing up large potential gains by being more diverse.

on a side note, keep in mind that reits are your highest holding by sector, and reits get taxed more harshly than most other stocks (because they are ""ordinary dividends"" and are taxed at short term capital gains rate instead of ""qualified dividends"" that are taxed at long term rates). or at least in the us that's the case. not sure what country you're from.",2,1599693455.0

Also read the three articles about ""Chowder"" posted here for ideas on how to select and manage such a portfolio: [https://dgiforthediy.com/resources/](https://dgiforthediy.com/resources/)  Then look at the two blogs he runs on Seeking Alpha, one tracking a ""Young Folk's"" portfolio and the other an ""Old Folks.""

There are also good articles here, particularly by David Van Knapp and Mike Nadel: [https://dailytradealert.com/](https://dailytradealert.com/)

One of the best tools for researching dividend-paying stocks is the U.S.  Dividend Champion spreadsheet posted here (top of the left column).  You  can sort/filter the list by price among many other criteria: [https://www.dripinvesting.org/Tools/Tools.asp](https://www.dripinvesting.org/Tools/Tools.asp)

While using it in your due diligence to select what companies to partner with  don't forget parameters like financial strength (credit rating) of BBB+ or better.  This is particularly important in times like  these.     For even more confidence, only look at those that have    increased their dividends for over 12 years, which covers the last recession.

 WBA - they’re well positioned during COVID, but between Walgreens and CVS they’re pretty much on every corner.  Growth probably to slow

Maybe both. As I see in this subreddit, most people is very liberal with their investments, pursuing large companies at even high prices, just because they are considered 'stable'.  


I think being conservative is not a problem in investing, I consider myself as conservative investor as well. You can find great targets, but it takes more time. For example I consider MSFT a great company and I would invest in it, but I find the current valuation too expensive. I would like to invest in INTC as well, but this price is still a bit high for me.  


If you want to get conservative suggestions I suggest to follow some SeekingAlpha editors, like Chuck Carneval, or The Falcon Method.

- ""VZ: Verizon increases dividend by 2% to $0.6275""

- competition: cisco's product offering is all over the place. Due to lack of focus they're doing a bunch of things, but becoming worst and worst in each segment.

- they had very solid networking hardware and that was their core product. They didn't embrace cloud tech as fast as they should have and now face competition from nearly every player out there. From Microsoft to juniper to cumulus to f5.

- their move to the software and security market was abysmal, IMHO. Yes they have a lot of customers who could just get an upsell to their VPN, etc. But many opt out for more modern and less expensive solutions.

I've been investing in QYLD for years now, and their strategy (covered calls on Naz100) and the income it produces are the best I've come across. I believe QQQX is a 50/50 blend of the QYLD model and Naz100 itself. It'll pay less than QYLD in dividends (probably about 50% of what QYLD pays) because QQQX only writes calls on half of their Naz100 holdings.... however, when the Naz100 rises quickly, the other half of QQQX's Naz100 holdings will ride along for the ride skyward, while QYLD will have their holdings ""called away"" and then have to buy their Naz100 shares back at higher prices. So, a 50/50 blend of QYLD/QQQ does offer a balance of these strategies & their respective pro's & con's.

WARNING: Investing in either or both of these two ETFs (in any combination) means that you are still highly correlated with Naz100, which means that QYLD & QQQX will both take a hit when Naz100 goes down. Here's a chart of their price movements:

They do this by playing metaphorical hopscotch with their company's stock. They will get a below average salary, then millions in company stock, diluting my shares. They immediately turn around and sell a portion of the stock to pay themselves, which causes the price to drop because ""if the CEO is selling millions in stock, that must mean they think the company is overvalued.""

Any feedback on the Wiki is very much welcome! I know that it seems like a lot of text to read, but since this is mostly for the new ones amongst us, I thought that a ""couple"" of explanitory words wouldn't hurt.

With that said, there are plenty of dividend oriented ETFs. There are also ETFs that own preferred shares, where appreciation isn't a goal at all, just current payments. There are high yield bond ETFs which are the same (primary goal is payouts, but you may seen appreciation if the market starts liking their underlying bonds, through upgrades, or otherwise).

Really, though, there is no practical limit, as long as each element serves its own purpose.

Speaking for myself, while overall I have a pretty balanced portfolio, I do have a little extra emphasis on dividend payers.

t3_iv6lud,g5yzyww,"4 ETFs for Dividend Growth Investors
by George L Smyth
There are ETFs that cover pretty much any groupings one can think of and that includes issues of interest to long term investors. I look at four ETFs that are geared toward the prudent dividend growth investor.

To understand exchange traded funds (ETFs) one needs to go back to 31 December 1975.  On that date John Bogle opened the First Index Investment Trust, a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500.  Started with just $11 million in assets the fund was called ""un-American"" and referred to as ""Bogle's folly"" by his competitors.  Later renamed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, it crossed the $100 billion milestone by the end of 1999.  Today Vanguard is the largest provider of mutual funds with assets over $5 trillion.

With the success of what Fidelity Investments Chairman Edward Johnson once referred to as “just average returns,” companies realized that there was money to be made bypassing mutual funds, which can be complicated for the investor and require minimum amounts to participate.  To make things easier for the investor to participate, after some fits and starts, the first ETF to be available in the United States was Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts, or SPDR, which tracks the S&P 500.

With about 5,000 ETFs globally (1,750 in the U.S.), these instruments offer convenience and affordable exposure to a wide range of investments.  According to etfdb.com there are over 230 dividend ETFs currently being traded in the U.S., so that is a rather large bucket from which to choose.  That said, the prudent dividend investor generally looks for companies with strong dividend growth over a long period of time, so that narrows things down a bit.

What I will do is to look at four ETFs that track companies focusing on dividend growth.  After all, we have found that Dividend Champions, Aristocrats, and Kings have done quite well when compared to the S&P 500 Index, so if one is seeking to go the ETF route then it might make sense to find one that tracks one of those lists.

Alas, there are no ETFs that track Dividend Champions or Kings.  Why this is not the case it a mystery to me.  Dividend Champions and Dividend Aristocrats are pretty much the same with the exception that Aristocrats must be listed in the S&P 500 while the Champions do not have that restriction.  We will examine an ETF that follows the former.

As Dividend Kings need to have offered at least 50 consecutive years of dividend growth there are only 28 companies in the list.  While it seems to me that this could be an extremely low expense ratio ETF, one could make their own ETF by buying all of the companies themselves.

As this blog and website are geared to the small investor one might wonder how I can make such a suggestion.  After all, we do not have access to the resources for doing this.  One idea might be to copy the companies in the list  and paste them into InvestMete (AWR DOV NWN EMR GPC PG PH MMM CINF JNJ KO LANC LOW FMCB CL NDSN HRL TR ABM CWT FRT SCL SJW SWK TGT CBSH MO SYY), enter any number for the Amount, and click the Determine InvestMete button.

It will take a little while to process all of them, but when the numbers are displayed sort by InvestMete and buy what you can of those with the highest InvestMete amounts.  My guess is that by purchasing additional shares this way on a regular basis, over the years this dollar cost averaging strategy would eventually include a great many of these companies.  But this is an article about 4 ETFs.

ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF
NOBL is the best known ETF amongst those who look for dividend growth.  It is the only one to track the S&P 500® Dividend Aristocrats® Index, which consists of companies that have increased their dividend every year for the past 25 years, are members of the S&P 500, and meet certain liquidity requirements (actually, all of the S&P 500 meets these liquidity requirements).  The stocks within this ETF are equally weighted and are rebalanced four times a year.

Yield	5 Year Return	10 Year Return	Expense Ratio
1.94%	10.86%	N/A	0.35%
SPDR® S&P® Dividend ETF
SDY tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats (^SPHYDA), which are companies that have increased their dividend for at least 20 consecutive years.  Stocks are weighted within the index by indicated yield and adjusted every quarter.  The dividend growth streak gives the roughly 60 holdings the characteristic of being some of the safest companies and tend toward stable industries.

Yield	5 Year Return	10 Year Return	Expense Ratio
2.52%	10.53%	13.02%	0.35%
Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF

VIG tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which contains companies that have increased their dividend over at least the past ten years.  (Disclosure – I recently started a small stake in this ETF.)  REITs are not included in this ETF because they do not receive favorable tax rates from qualified dividends.  About 180 companies comprise the ETF with exposure primarily in the consumer staples, health care, and industrials sectors.

Yield	5 Year Return	10 Year Return	Expense Ratio
1.63%	12.13%	12.96%	0.06%
Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF
SCHD, like VIG, contains companies that have increased their dividend for at least the past ten years.  It tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100® Index, excluding REITs, master limited partnerships, preferred stocks and convertibles.  The index is modified market capitalization weighted.  The mix of dividend growth and yield in the roughly 100 companies allow for a greater payout than the above ETFs.

Yield	5 Year Return	10 Year Return	Expense Ratio
3.03%	11.32%	N/A	0.06%
Of Note
SDY and VIG have been around since 2006, so they have 10 years of history to report.  Since these ETFs have fairly strict consecutive streak requirements and are passively managed this is really of no advantage over others with less history.

Of definite advantage, however, is the fact that both VIG and SCHD have very low expense ratios.  Expenses can savagely cut into one’s holdings, so having a low expense ratio is an important part of maintaining one’s portfolio.  If a higher expense ratio is to be paid then there should be a strong reason for seeing more money taken out of one’s pocket.

Other Growth Dividend ETFs
Indeed there are other ETFs that base their selection on dividend growth and this was certainly not intended to be a complete list.  However, they do start to become redundant.  For instance, Invesco Dividend Achievers ETF (PFM), which was mentioned in Dividend Champions, Achievers, Kings and Aristocrats – A Comparison against the Indexes, is nearly the same as the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) with the exception that the former allows REITs and the latter does not.  However, with an expense ratio of 0.54% it does not compare well against VIG.

There are others, like iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO), that are based on dividend growth but only require a consecutive string of five years, similar to Dividend Challengers.  It does offer an attractive expense ratio of 0.08%, but in my mind such a short streak, while certainly better over the long haul than companies not offering a dividend, is less of a growth streak we would normally seek.

Finishing Up
With research one should be able to find other ETFs that better fit their specific requirements.  If one is looking for ETFs that concentrate on dividend growth over a long period of time, any of the above can work well as the cornerstone in one’s portfolio.",4,1600605981.0

t3_iw34z9,g5wyzyl,"As a beginner, regardless of your sources, I will save you a lot of time during your study with these 7 points:

 1. Pay no respect to volatility of the markets. Who fucking cares about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, ""all time highs"", ""all time lows"" or wherever the fuck we are on the ""graph"". You should not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, you should not care at all. Volatility should not mean anything to you since you should be a super long-term investor.

 2. You cannot predict the future and you cannot time the market. ""Time in the market"" is superior to ""timing the market"" as per academic studies. Therefore, you should invest as much as you can every time you get paid while while balancing a decent quality of life (whatever that means to you). Basically, don't try to pull off some ""smart shit"" by pulling out your money because you think the markets will crash and then put your money back into the market after it crashes to capitalize on that hypothetical situation in your little head. Turn off your brain and keep your money in the markets because again, ""time in the market"" is superior to ""timing the market"" as per academic studies.

 3. You should consider investing in an ""index exchange traded fund"" or ""index-ETF"" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index-ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors who pick stocks will under perform an index-ETF over the long-term.

 4. Don’t day trade. Don't try to ""get rich quick"". Don't try to ""buy low, sell high"". Don't buy shit/garbage. Don't buy ""meme stocks"". Don't worry about ""missing out"". Build wealth slowly over time as this is a long-term game and not a short-term or medium-term game.

 5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity because everything goes on sale which includes high-quality companies and index-ETFs; and therefore, you get to buy more stuff at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them instead because these are the times which can actually accelerate you towards your financial goals quicker.

 6. Again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics/elections, wars, recessions, poverty, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in buying index-ETFs or purchasing well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until you retire or die.

 7. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is ""different"" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks about volatility).

t3_iw34z9,g5x2z0q,"Disclaimer: Also pretty new. Have had an account for 5+ years but really started Feb 20th this year. Doing good enough so far! (knock on wood) 

I learned by reading a book that gave a general overview of everything (Warren Buffets 3 Favorite books by Preston Psyh. Cheesy name but it's incredibly easy to follow and does a great job explaining things and gives a safe enough strategy as well as teaching you how to find stocks yourself pretty effectively. Even if you don't read this one, pick a short and encompassing book designed for beginners. There's tons, and it's the best $10-15 investment you can make.   


In the beginning, I would say use what you learn and decide what you're interested in. What industries do you find interesting enough that you'd be willing to read about companies in? ""Invest in what you know"" is a fun idea, check out Peter Lynch for more on that. Most importantly, in the beginning, pick things that will keep you interested and wanting to learn more. Even better if you're making good investments, which you're more likely to do if you're interesting in the company for more than just their financial statements.   


Once you're more comfortable, which comes quick if you have fun learning and becoming better, start to build a strategy. Maybe read a book on dividend investing, go from there. Odds are, you'll find a rabbit hole one day and end up finding where you're comfortable.   


As for actionable steps:   
1. Find a good book for beginners, give it a read.   
2. Invest in some companies you're personally interested in. This will keep you interested.   
3. Keep learning more, and use the stocks you own as examples for what you're reading/watching. You'll start to see what makes a good and bad investment a bit more clearly.   
4. Start to develop a strategy. Pick a long term goal, then start figuring out a way to get there. Choose a destination then map out the path.   
5. Keep learning and adjusting your strategy to more effectively achieve your goals.   


Avoid:  
1. Margin. Do not trade with margin. This is where people get into debt with investing.   
2. Options, for now. Options can be very useful, especially for more complex strategies, but learn normal investing for now.

But to go along with what you're saying, you can still get quality and spaced out dividend payments, although its not as easy as just buying a bunch of monthly payers. 

For example lets look at September over the past 5 years: 

JNJ has paid out on the 8th-10th

MCD has paid out on the 15th-17th

PEP has paid out on the 28th-30th

They also follow similar schedules for the other months they pay out (except PEP pays in Jan instead of Dec). So that's roughly 4 months where you're getting 3 dividend payouts throughout the month. You could repeat the process for the other sets of months by first finding quality companies and then opting for the ones that best fit your intended payout schedule.

At least, that's what I would do if I was looking to evenly space out income.... I'd find quality companies I'd be interested in owning long term first, and then decide on which ones to invest in based on payouts after.

This will include such things as your wages, self employment net income, interest, dividends and part of your Social Security and any pension amounts if applicable. All of this income except qualified dividends (QD) and long term capital gains (LTCG) are taxed as 'ordinary income' at tax table rates.  If you subtract your standard deduction of $12,400 (for singles, twice this for marrieds) from your Gross income (I'm assuming you don't itemize your deductions) you'll have your 'Taxable Income'. The tax rate on QD + LTCG (you can add them together as they are both taxed at the same rate) will be  as follows for singles:

Taxable  Income..............tax rate on QD + LTCG

<$40,000...................................0%

$40,000 to $441,450..............15%

\>$441,450...............................20%

There's also another 3.8% tax for single's gross incomes over $200,000, but that's another topic.

All C-Corporations pay QDs. The idea here is the earnings used to pay the dividend was just taxed at the corporate tax rate, so taxing them again would be a form of double taxation, hence the more favorable tax treatment.

REITs may have a small part of their dividend as QD and perhaps some LTCG, but most of it is ordinary income.

All interest from corporate bonds, CDs, Money Market funds and Business Development Company's (BDCs) is ordinary income

Taxable brokerage accounts usually do not withhold anything to send to the IRS...you do that with estimated quarterly tax payments if the dividends are large enough

It is far from complete and there is a whole lot of information still missing but I am working on it and for the time being I think this should give you some relevant and interesting information. I am trying to add an article a day so you can come back and look for new stuff to read every day ^^ also, if you read it let me know what you think, any feedback is greatly appreciated and in case you have some more questions feel free to post! I will keep an eye out and maybe some questions that you might have will be included in the wiki in the future. 

And two things - for one, you are still young. Don't sweat it and try to get everything right from the beginning. At least the first year of investing is more to learn about the market, how to pick good stocks for you, about yourself and what kind of investor you are. Don't be afraid to make mistakes now, as they will very likely happen at some points. And now they are not as impactful as they are later in life. For the other, we all know how it is to be young and that priorities change quickly. Like yes, dividends are nice, investing is nice, having that return is nice but going out with friends is even nicer, inviting a lady or gentleman for dinner is even nicer than that and a good night out stealing through the streets can be just as alluring. Find a way to bring all what you want to do (going out, meeting friends, dating a person and invite them to dinner etc etc) in harmony with what you want for your future (steady stream of passive income). I think that is the most important lesson that you can learn now that will help you to stay on course for the next 10 years.

t3_iwo10z,g61vegq,"I don't even understand the desire to ""line up quarterly dividends to receive one every month"". 

So, you're going to go stock shopping based on *when* a company pays dividends instead of investing in the best possible set of companies regardless of dividend dates? This seems short-sighted and poorly thought-out. 

So if your two favorite dividend payers pay in the same month, you're going to go with your third option to offset your payments? Why not just save some of the money you received in June for your July expenses instead of trying to find a company that pays out in July? Are we that poor at personal finance?",51,1600649419.0

Some people do what you’ve described. Some people who are in a traditional brokerage acct might be more apt to avoid a situation like you described due to the tax ramifications.",10,1600641967.0
t3_iwo10z,g62h0on,"So here's the thing, monthly dividend payers usually have a catch to them. O for example is generally the favorite out there for a monthly dividend. O is also a REIT, which means that A. They make so much money as a real estate holder that they by law have to pass off the majority of the money they earn to the shareholders and B. Because of that it is not a qualified dividend. Qualified Dividends are dividends that are taxed at the Capital Gains rate, which means as long as your total income in a year is under $40,000 you pay nothing on your money earned. After that it's 15% until you're in the hundreds of thousands. On any other dividend you receive, you'll be taxed at your ordinary tax rate, likely 12-22%.  


ETF's that pay monthly have some sort of catch to them as well. Any ETF that holds Real Estate or Foreign stocks will end up giving you a tax breakdown of what percentage of the dividend has to be sorted into qualified and ordinary dividends. Then there is also a section of ETF's that are actively trading stocks within their portfolio in an attempt to make more money for you, the shareholder, passing along part of whatever profit they make from that. Those will not be qualified.   


On top of all that, it is generally accepted that the majority of monthly payers are foregoing growing in value to pass along money to you the shareholder. You might buy 100 shares of some $5 monthly payer, but in 20 years time it might only rise with inflation and be $10 a share. Double your money, but in 20 years you probably want more than an extra $500 for your investment.   


The basis of dividend investment being successful is the effective use of compounding interest, that is, the more money you can have invested that makes you money, the faster your money can grow. So it is factually accurate that you can make more physical money right off the bat by buying a bunch of small monthly stocks because they will pay you faster. But by doing so you are foregoing the other benefits of investing, because you will be taxed on any dividends received, and the stocks themselves are very unlikely to grow to a number that will serve you in retirement. They are good however for making money in the short term.   


So if you want to invest in monthly payers, I suggest doing so in a ROTH IRA, because any dividends earned will be tax free. On top of that, instead of using those monthly payers to buy more monthly payers, I would recommend using the monthly income to buy shares of better investments. Unless you have a lot of money to mess with I don't recommend having monthly paying stocks in a taxable account, because it's gonna cost you in the short term.",9,1600662936.0

t3_iwo10z,g63s0vc,"We're supposed to be nice here, so let me try.

Buying a stock based on what week or month it pays a dividend is foolhardy.  You buy a company because it is profitable, its profits are growing, it keeps innovating to keep increasing those profits, it husbands its resources well not buying companies just to get bigger.  You make sure the dividend is sustainable and has a history of increases as the profits grow.  

The day of the week, month is the least important data set you should review.  This is why I track my dividends by the quarter not the month.  For instance, July and August are my biggest months while September earns about $500 less but what I compare is the 1st quarter to the 2nd quarter.  And the quarters change when I rotate out of one sector into another.  

I earn about $30k a year, what day of the week it pays doesn't matter as most of the dividends are used to buy more stock anyway.  I even out the income by having savings that cover 2 year's worth of expenses.  

Buying a stock just because it pays every month and not knowing what it makes, how profitable it is, is just throwing darts at a chart.

Other than this, if the stock only pays an annual dividend or if it’s quarterly it really doesn’t matter. You really want the stock to stay at the same price or go up overtime or the dividends don’t really matter do they?

I’ve seen a lot of people invest in REITs with high dividends, but the underlying fund also loses value every month meaning that you are really just taking on the tax burden of the company by collecting a dividend on a stock that continues to degrade.

Apple: Self explanatory.

Disney: They manage amusement parks, cruise ships, endless merchandise and continue to expand their online presence, especially video content. Excellent brand loyalty.

Starbucks: Brand loyalty amongst the best.

Home Depot: Demand has boomed with stay at home restrictions. People like and continue to shop at Home Depot.

VISA: Every time you see someone swipe their card, that helped you grow your equity and dividend.

Johnson&Johnson: Extremely diversified portfolio of products people use everyday from shampoo to drugs.

When it comes to dividends it is considered safer to invest into larger, more established companies... However, if you do your research and a smaller company looks attractive to you then add it to your portfolio.

I prefer ETFs for a few reasons 1. Built-in diversification 2. Some hope that money managers will rebalance the holdings if doo doo hits the fan. For a small (relatively) fee it buys me a little peace of mind.
That said, many people will look at top ten or twenty holdings in a given ETF and construct their portfolios based on that. But you will have to do more work and keep close watch over individual companies.

With that said I typically recommend three ETFs:

- SCHD - dow dividend payers
- SPHD - s&p dividend payers, +monthly, + REITs. It is facing some difficulty right now, but this is where I hope fund managers will make appropriate decisions, if the fund indeed tracks what it promises.

Absent the advice of an attorney or accountant, there is no real advantage to moving your investments from your own name into the name of a business entity that you 100% own and control.

A single member LLC has its taxes flow through to your tax return as if it didn't exist, it's only purpose is for liability protection. Since the stocks and bonds you own already expose you to  no liability, there isn't a benefit to shield yourself from them by holding them in an LLC. Likewise, any expenses that you would take by holding them in an LLC would show up on your Schedule  C, so you could just as easily hold them there.

Also, being the only member of the LLC provides no protection of your assets in the event that you are sued.

AN LLC or more likely a Family Limited Partnership can be a valuable estate planning vehicle, but only if you're wealthy enough to have a taxable estate - the lack of control your limited partners (heirs) have over it could provide a mechanism to provide a discount on the value of the assets held by it.  An LLC could do the same, but FLP's have held up in IRS determinations, I don't believe LLC's have. I could be mistaken though.

End of the day, this is a tax and legal question. If you're not wealthy enough to have a family attorney and an accountant doing your taxes, you there probably aren't any benefits to using an LLC. And if you are using an attorney, odds are they will direct you to create Trusts then, if you know you won't need direct access to the funds ever again, transfer them to an LLC, then gift memberships of that LLC to the trusts. Then you can continue managing all the assets under one account, even though they will ultimately end up in many hands.

I personally dislike T. It’s a dividend yield trap. 2% dividend growth over 10-15 years with flat or negative equity growth is garbage. Investors jump on this for the yield which is a big mistake. There could be a short turn around in the price in the future but its definitely not a cutting edge company that will actually grow. 

Stay away from SPHD at your age. It’s basically a value high dividend yield ETF. It doesn’t promote growth of equity, only high yield dividend stocks. (Don’t ever chase yield).

MMM and KO are ok. I hold them. Dividend growth is better than T but only around 5-6% over ten years.

The other equities I hold. Their dividends grow ok, nothing really special about them but they are good solid companies.

You can’t go wrong with holding PG, JNJ, MCD if you add some higher dividend growth stocks.

MSFT, AAPL, MA, V, TROW, ATVI, NKE, CMCSA, DHI, QCOM, NVDA, are some equities you might want to look at if you have the time to keep up with constant individual research. They are solid, dividend growth equities that are also growing revenue and price. Yields are low but again, don’t chase yield.

MLPs are partnership units, not shares. They pay distributions, not dividends. Their distributions outlined on the K-1 for the tax year, will be an assortment of capital gains, interest, ordinary income but mostly, return of principal, due to their very high depreciation expenses. This return of principal will reduce your basis and the net loss the MLP declares each year will be 'stored' until you sell your units, then it can be used against gains on sale.

Further, owning 50 different companies could lead to over-diversification.

- always research your investment. Learn and follow some criteria for yourself.
Examples... industry growth: tech vs big oil, your personal outlook on the company growth, fundamentals: P/E, P/B, consider analysts ratings with a grain of salt. 
- understand your goals. I'd recommend investing into SCHD for safety and ARKK for growth. But I don't know what you are after. Really figure out what you'd like to see in your portfolio
- build a portfolio model, and compare to s&p... While past isn't reflection of the future you should look at current CAGR of your model and consider playing around with alternatives
- no matter what, right now you should be concerned with growing your capital. So always reinvest or drip.
- understand tax implications
- always look at underlying holdings of an ETF 
- always look at the criteria for selections of the holdings in an ETF
- practice dollar cost averaging 

To give you a short answer, for someone who should have higher risk tolerance, IMHO

- SCHD/VSDA: 50/50 - semi aggressive
- SCHD/SPHD/ARKK - medium risk, growth, diversified
- SCHD/IDV/SPHD/VSDA/XBI/SKYY/SUSA - semi aggressive, positioned for growth, but has a few old school holdings in SPHD, but also a few REITs and moderate in SCHD. Int'l exposure and lots of cutting edge tech. Dividends and monthly dividends.",7,1600996181.0

If you're a newbie I'm assuming you're young, if you're not shift what I'm about to say a little bit.

You should be focusing on dividend growth stocks. Major companies that pay small dividends but have massive growth potential. 

Get it set up in a Roth IRA that offers fractional shares. I find that Fidelity has the largest selection, but Schwab has the s&p 500 and TOS offers DRIP but not the option to buy fractional from my understanding.

It sucks cause right now we're in a bit of weird stage in the market where it could all come tumbling down. Who knows what will happen. But if you're average dollar cost averaging you can throw a few dollars into each of your favorite stocks and leave the DRIP on.

This idea still applies to ETFs if you want to do that in combination with growth dividend investing.

I start of very simplistic & utilize several different metrics to get a better overall picture. I've been into stocks for about 6 or so months but I've been in research for years so I'm able to quickly go from a broad knowledge, utilize search data and collate several metrics to try to get a more clear picture on broad subjects. Then I'll move to buzz words that I continue to see, cross reference those and then move on to the next bit of more specific information. I've tried to apply this template to dividend stocks & dividend ETFs. (My main investments are listed at the bottom). I tried to figure out my goal. I see that you are like me and looking for primarily growth in stocks but would like dividends as well to build your portfolio overtime which I'm assuming you'd like to eventually convert into monthly income (myself  included).

&#x200B;

(\*Screenshot For Everything below: [https://ibb.co/QXJXqh9](https://ibb.co/QXJXqh9)

1) EXCEL SHEET CREATION

\- I start with a simplistic Excel sheet. I don't like getting too complicated as I'm not a really experienced trader so I look for stuff that I can compare from stock to stock. P/E and FFO and other things are just too in depth for me to mainly care about at this point. I wanted something I can look at and say hey, that is this and this is slightly better/worse or higher/lower.

\- I list out the main overall market SYMBOLs for broad market indexes/tradable ETFs: $VTI $SPY $DIA - Through my initial forums/Facebook threads/Reddit research I found these to follow the market and people always suggest these as a base or a set/forget style investment strategy that holds up over long periods of time. I use these as my base comparisons to any potential investments. They are highlighted in GREEN on the screenshot.

\- Next I just start adding to my Excel sheet. Mainly things you can easily look up and that are fairly compatible in comparing to each other; DIVIDEND YIELD - DIV PER SHARE - PAYOUT FREQUENCY - 5yr GROWTH

\- I used SeekingAlpha to give me the 3yr DIVIDEND GROWTH RATE - \*I wanted to use the 5yr but some of them weren't avail.

\- I added the FREQUECY MULTIPLIER to help with the Potential Growth calculation (getting there below). \*(12x) = Monthly Div. Payouts -- (4x) = Quarterly Div. Payouts -- (2x) = Semiannual Div Payout -- (1x) = Annual Div Payout

\- My goal was to try to find my overall yearly growth average and compare that to those 3 main market ETFs: I wanted consistency and something easy to read. I originally was trying to use Google's built in lookup but it didn't give me a good result and I had to hold my mouse down and drag over to measure ""5yrs"".  That was inconsistent. My primary dividend growth/long term investing account is with Robinhood (my other is TD Ameritrade & etrade & Webull).

\- I went to Robinhood, looked up a symbol, then clicked the button for 5Y. This gave me an easy percent to throw into my ""5yr Growth"" slot on the excel sheet. I went through every symbol to fill in my excel sheet.

\- Then, I went to the next block and used a quick function to take that 5yr Growth and dividend by 5yrs to give the general 1yr growth average. \*Remember, I'm long in the market so I'm just looking for averages overall, not exactly what happened. I just want to see easy to read numbers to help me look for stocks.

\- I wanted to account for the dividend yield in some way so I made the POTENTIAL 5yr GROWTH. Using a quick function I took the \[DIVIDEND YIELD (x) FREQ MULTIPLIER\] to get about the %-yield for 5yrs. Then Took that number and added it to the ""5yr Growth"" slot. This became the 5yr POTENTIAL GROWTH. Then I took that and made another column to get the 1yr average.

Limitation of Calculation:

1. Simplistic
2. Does NOT Account For DRIP/Compounding

\- As you can see this gave me a LOT of data to look at in general. I know there is much more specific stuff you can look into but I really wanted simplistic overviews to make quicker choices. I don't want to spend hours & days on things, especially since hospital work and a daughter take a lot of my free time already.

\- I start sorting the data. I sort by high to low or however the category is. I first started with the 3yr dividend growth rate. I highlighted everything that was higher than the VTI (lowest but most broad market fund).

\- Then sorted the base 5yr growth and highlighted everything that was larger than VTI. I did the same for all the categories on growth. \*As you can see, some of the Potential growths are larger than the base growth when adding in the dividend yields. This is exactly why I wanted to make that simplistic calculation despite the limitations. This doesn't even account for the overall potential earnings when fractionally reinvesting through DRIP or the compounding that occurs every payout.

&#x200B;

2) FURTHER RESEARCH

\- After utilizing basic data from the excel sheet and finding some interesting holdings I'll go into my TD Ameritrade account. It has some of the most market analyst ratings you can find. Typically the Morningstar rating along with a ton of others. This really makes it easy to see how well each fund is respected. There is also a fairly neat comparison tool you can use to compare different ETFs or find some that are similar to the one you have in mind.

\- If it looks good to me I'll look into buying some shares. I usually will buy shares and then on the days when I get some money, I'll bolster the tickers I see are up the least amount or in last weeks case, down the furthest hah!! If there is a quarterly Ex-Div date coming up I'll usually use that free cash on hand to bolster that particular fund. You'll get more realized gains that way quicker. A good strategy is having a good mix of monthly & quarterly payers. DRIP the monthly ones, but use the dividends from the quarterly payers to buy more of the next upcoming symbol that is going Ex-Div 1st. That way you continually have quicker ""realized gains"" as opposed to using that money to put into something that isn't going to payout again for another 3-months.

&#x200B;

3) RESEARCH PLACES

\- These are where I usually try to find decent ETFs or a good ETF screen/research/etc.

1. ETF Overlap: ETFRC --> ETF Tools --> Fund Overlap
2. ETF Screener: ETFDB / DIVIDEND(.)COM / FINVIZ (One of the best free tools ever!) / Fidelity
3. General Info: SeekingAlpha / Dividend (.) com

&#x200B;

4) RATINGS USED TYPICALLY

\- These are the ratings I usually use when seeing if I really want to invest in those funds. I used TD Ameritrade & Webull a lot to see ratings. These free accounts make great research tools.

1. Morningstar (TD Ameritrade & Webull)
2. Zacks
3. Lipper Leader
4. Random TD Ameritrade Ratings (Lots of goodies to use & read - Get a free account just for that alone, totally worth it!)
5. Reddit/Facebook Group comment overlapping recommendations. I ALWAYS use the search button for things like ""Best growth"" / ""SPHD"" or something and see what comments pop up. You can't beat people who really try to explain it in plain english what is going on with the stock and why it's good/bad. Use people's knowledge but DO NOT RELY ON IT. DO YOUR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE

&#x200B;

5) MY GENERAL PORTFOLIO \*I am NOT a financial advisor.

\- These are my long holdings. I have a few play ones but those are throw aways I wouldn't recommend. Mainly Future bets to play with.

* $DGRO $DGRW $FTEC $IWY $O $PBW $PEY $SMH $SPHD $SPLV $STAG $STOR $VUG

\- Once you start getting into the 10s of thousands in holdings, start to evaluate the EXPENSE RATIO as well. This is kind of a yearly ""fee"". It can make a difference on large accounts.

&#x200B;

\*\*Wow, this turned into a REALLY long hr long write up. I hope this helps. I know it feels like a tangent but going by one single rating isn't worth it. You really need to evaluate stocks on several different components or at least a couple different ratings.",5,1601164742.0

A couple points. So, to clear up what you may be trying to say.

* Prior to retirement you want to amass a large portfolio with growth. This would be a combination of cash injections over the years into your portfolio (I.E. buying more shares) and GROWTH stocks.
* Near or at retirement you are looking for income. So, one would typically start selling those growth stocks/holdings/shares and start purchasing higher yielding stocks (usually more sideways slow growth due to the higher yields). SPHD, PEY, T and the like are stocks that are great for retirement. Or you can look into high yielding dividend aristocrats/champions.

Typically growth stocks will yield more $$$ for your money overtime with growth than a high yielding stock. It's been shown that high quality lower yields will grow more with DRIP than DRIP with higher yielding percent. Take a look at a screen shot from my potential investments I've considered and some that I'm in. If you look at the 1yr potential growth (takes into account the yield), you'll notice that the higher the percent, you'll see a trend of a lower yield. It doesn't always hold true but focus on growth over time instead of dividends UNLESS you want the monthly income to spend NOW. --> [https://ibb.co/QXJXqh9](https://ibb.co/QXJXqh9) (\*To note - REITs are a little different so always research those more like $STOR $STAG etc. Also, disregard $REML $RYLD $JEPI unless you know what you're looking at for those).

t3_j1h96r,g6zin3d,"I started over 30 years ago using what was then a novel website that allowed direct purchases of stocks from companies.  I started a position and would keep plunking money into that company until I had invested $5,000, only then would I buy stock number 2.  

For the first 15 years I DRIPed everything but then I started considering why wait 3 months to see the results of my dividend being reinvested.  So I started taking the dividends in cash and would use them to buy more of one the the stocks I already owned.

Why the change?  Well if I DRIP, I see the result of my additional investment in 3 months when I get the next dividend.  I also am not choosing the price I am paying because the process is automated.  So I started taking the dividends in cash and bought whichever stock was going ex-dividend the soonest and was in the low end of its normal trading range.  This way I am choosing the price I pay and I see the results in a month instead of 3 months.  

Today I am retired and take in about $30,000 a year in dividends.  I  take about $24,000 in sales out of my taxable account each to supplement my Social Security.  I feel safe knowing that I am taking in more than I am spending each year.

It takes a long time before you see the payoff.  Buying just 1.237 shares with your DRIP each quarter isn't very exciting.  Eventually you get to where you are buying 4.583 shares and one day, you have $2000 a month to spend.  

I hope some of you will avoid wasting time and money chasing yields as I did early on and figure out sooner than I did that buying for the dividend without understanding the company that is paying it, is foolhardy.",106,1601321775.0
t3_j1h96r,g6zetaw,"I got the idea of dividend investing from my grandfather (in an indirect way).  He was the most frugal man on planet earth, living significantly below his means.  He was also kinda (definitely) a cheapskate.  He was a decent man and hated the thought of paying too much for things. One of the biggest pet peeves in his life was the thought of paying someone to make money for you.  He started telling me when I was six to always remember to invest in no-load assets.  Six-year-old me had absolutely zero clue what that meant, but I still remember it to this day because he mentioned it every time child me went over and stayed the night.

Being from rural Kentucky pre-internet, my grandfather did not have many options for brokerage services.  Every option he did have charged absolutely insane fees, which my grandfather considered a death penalty offense.  I did not learn this until a few years before his death, but the way he invested is unlike probably anyone in the modern day.

My grandfather would write letters to large, publicly traded companies and just ask to buy stock directly from them.  Skip the stock exchanges, brokerages, and commissions.  He just wrote letters.  That was apparently something you could do back then (many companies still allow it today).  The interesting part is that he flatly refused to pay a fee of any kind.  He would actually haggle and negotiate via letter to get zero fees.

My favorite interaction was how he got invested in Ford back in 1962.  He started by writing the company directly.  For some reason, he never heard back.  So he wrote either the company or the SEC and somehow got the past 15 years of annual reports.  I'm not sure if he paid for them or not, but somehow he got them.  He read through them and found one line in one report that mentioned in passing a particular executive had been with the company for 35 years.  My grandfather reasons (with 0 evidence) this executive is likely nearing retirement and may be willing to offload a few shares.  So my grandfather somehow gets his hands on a phone book for the Detroit Metro Area and writes a letter to everyone with the same name.  He eventually reaches the executive who actually writes back.  Turns out the executive had been mulling retirement the very next year, and had not even told his wife.  Long story short, my grandfather and the Ford executive exchange correspondence, and arranged a sale to take place one week after his retirement sometime in either 1963 or 1964.  I wish I could tell you the executive's name, but my grandfather lost most of his paper records back in the early 80s in a fire, with his unexpected death robbing our family of the ability to find out this information.  My mom and aunt still jointly hold the shares though.  As they are not connected to any brokerage or investment account, they still got paper dividend checks up until Ford suspended their dividend earlier this year.",96,1601320174.0

I think that if the company was having difficulties paying their dividends then it will certainly have problems paying them now all things considered.

Correct me if I am wrong but, since this company gives out loans, the companies given the loans may have difficulties making payments. I do not know the business or how the company operates but I think that it would be best to stay away.

t3_j2u8xu,g77xif6,"Here are some more general guidelines which I sincerely believe that everyone should have ingrained in their heads when formulating their personal strategy:

1. Pay no respect to volatility of the markets. Who fucking cares about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, ""all time highs"", ""all time lows"" or wherever the fuck we are on the ""graph"". You should not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, you should not care at all. Volatility should not mean anything to you since you should be a super long-term investor.
2. You cannot predict the future and you cannot time the market. ""Time in the market"" is superior to ""timing the market"" as per academic studies. Therefore, you should invest as much as you can every time you get paid while while balancing a decent quality of life (whatever that means to you). Basically, don't try to pull off some ""smart shit"" by pulling out your money because you think the markets will crash and then put your money back into the market after it crashes to capitalize on that hypothetical situation in your little head. Turn off your brain and keep your money in the markets because again, ""time in the market"" is superior to ""timing the market"" as per academic studies.
3. You should consider investing in an ""index exchange traded fund"" or ""index-ETF"" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index-ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors who pick stocks will under perform an index-ETF over the long-term.
4. Don’t day trade. Don't try to ""get rich quick"". Don't try to ""buy low, sell high"". Don't buy shit/garbage. Don't buy ""meme stocks"". Don't worry about ""missing out"". Build wealth slowly over time as this is a long-term game and not a short-term or medium-term game.
5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity because everything goes on sale which includes high-quality companies and index-ETFs; and therefore, you get to buy more stuff at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them instead because these are the times which can actually accelerate you towards your financial goals quicker.
6. Again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics/elections, wars, recessions, poverty, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in buying index-ETFs or purchasing well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until you retire or die.
7. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is ""different"" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks about volatility).

Eventually share price means it is harder to sell shares--you get more money, but will likely never buy in again. And share price can be fickle--a few years back some generic rx makers were very high priced and now are penny stocks, so holding too long on some high priced stocks isn't safe either.

Dividend growth is a great signal of a company's own evaluation of its future. High yield can mean other things, although some stocks are meant to be high yield due to what they do and how they're taxed by the government. Don't chase yield as another person said but I would say chase dividend growth as a key signal.

I'd really recommend PGX also. 5% annual yield, minimal fluctuation in the share price. And I mean minimal fluctuation.

I’m 28 and also recently got into investing. Don’t fall for the yield trap. Yes it can be easy to fall into especially when first starting. I have some companies that have a high yield but it’s more important to to find dividend growth. I think a 2-4% yield is gonna be a better long term play than 4-10% that people will chase. 

Not saying the high dividend yielders won’t and can’t be a solid long term play but don’t base your whole portfolio around them.

t3_j4fyz7,g7j0dnc,"Utilities.   I have been stocking up on utilities in the last couple of months.  It is easy to find some with 3%, even greater than 4% yields.  And while these are slow growing companies, they are very safe government regulated entities that compound effectively over time.  Here is a list of the utility stocks I own, many of which I have initiated or added to recently:

Ticker-   Current yield-- 5 year dividend CAGR.

AES    -   3.1            ---        22.5

AWK   -   1.5            ---        10.1

AQN    -   4.2              ---        6.0

DUK     -  4.2         ---             3.5

DTE     -   3.6             ---         7.4

ED     -     3.8           ---           3.3  

NEE      -  2.0             ---       11.5

SO      -    4.6             ---          3.4

AES has a credit rating of only BB+, so I will not add to this position again, atleast until it rises to BBB+.

I particularly like stocks that have yields approaching 5%, with CAGR also approaching 5%.  Admittedly, these are hard to find.  But I believe that the utilities sector is a great place to find safe, secure dividend payers that make excellent long term investments.  So called ""widows and orphan's stocks"". The kind that you rarely need to monitor, but can retire on and never sell.

CAGR stands for compound annual growth rate.  It reflects how quickly a company grows its dividends over time.  Let's take NEE for example.  While it's current yield is a relatively low 2%, its CAGR is high at 11.5 %.  If we compare that to SO which has a higher yield of 4.6%, but a lower CAGR of 3.4 % we can predict what the yield on 
Cost (YOC) might be over time:

Year   -  NEE    --- SO

1       ---    2.0     --- 4.6                 
2        ---   2.2     --- 4.8  
3       ---    2.5     --- 4.9         
4        ---   2.8    ---  5.1         
5      ---     3.1   ---   5.3      
6       ---    3.5   ---   5.4            
7       ---    3.8 ---     5.6              
8       ---    4.3   ---   5.8           
9       ---    4.8    ---  6.0         
10     ---    5.3  ---    6.2         
11      ---   5.9    ---  6.4        
12      ---   6.6   ---   6.6       
13      ---   7.4  ---    6.9             
14   ---      8.2 ---     7.1            
15     ---    9.2    ---  7.4        
16    ---   10.2    ---  7.6       
17    ---   11.4    ---  7.9          
18    ---   12.7   ---   8.1           
19    ---   14.2     --- 8.4      
20     ---  15.8    ---  8.7

In other words, a $100 investment in each company would theoretically pay you 20 years from now:

NEE   $15.80/year

SO        $8.70/year  

Now will NEE be able to maintain a 10% growth rate every year for 20 years?  Probably not.  But it has been growing faster than nearly every other utility for quite a few years now.  That's why it's more expensive and its yield is lower than most of the other utilities. 

Anyway, utilities are the companies I have been focusing on lately.  Likely safe, even when the overall economy is uncertain.  Most everyone wants to keep the lights on, the water flowing, and the house warm.  And with prices overall good right now, I think this is a good time to pick some up.

Corning Glass - Great company. Benefiting during the virus due to their valor glass. Great 5G play due to fiber optic cables and gorilla glass. Price is a little too much for me to continue accumulating right now.

My 401k through my job is currently at around 110k.  30 percent of my pre tax income goes to this account.

My personal dividend portfolio is at around 6000, and is currently getting me around one dollar a day in dividend income.

At 80-100 dollars a day in dividend income, I will retire early, to either a very cheap US state, or an Asian or Eastern European country.

The goal isn’t so much the level of income that dividends provide you, the most important metric is how high the cost of living is where you live.  That radically changes your equation.

t3_j5mbhk,g7t1unq,"The raw unfiltered yield for [my portfolio](https://m1.finance/72APcoI8LAh8) of 45 holdings has a yield that fluctuates and balances around 3.5%, depending on how the market is feeling.  This is what I consider to be a goldilocks zone of yield.  

The important thing to remember though, is that yield chasing is never a good idea under any  circumstances.  Because when you get burned, you tend to get burned simultaneously and irreparably.  

If you look at my portfolio's performance through 2020, if you judged the portfolio solely by raw dividend returns taken in, 2020 actually will see a net **increase** in dividend income for me.    Even if I had not put in a penny through all of 2020, my dividend income would increase.

5 companies either reduced or eliminated their dividend due to the coronavirus.  However, 33 companies increased their dividend at some point in 2020 so far.  

I project four companies will increase their dividends still this year based upon prior year trends.  They just haven't announced their Q4 dividend yet. (Visa, Union Pacific, Broadcom, and Merck)

I know for a fact JP Morgan and Bank of America will maintain a stagnant dividend in 2020 due to the ban imposed by the government on the largest US banks raising dividends in 2020.  

The only stock I am unsure about is Stock Yards Bancorp.  I cannot remember off the top of my head if they are large enough to be under that prohibition on banks raising their dividend for 2020.  What I do know is that the company has never cut their dividend since the company went public some time in the 80s or 90s, and management is honestly the best I have ever seen of any bank, so I am not worried in the slightest.  In fact, I have been buying massive amounts of this company the past month or so.  Stock Yards derives over 80% of its revenue from clients in the Louisville, Kentucky Metro Area.  Although it is making massive efforts to diversity the geography of its revenue in recent years, all that Breonna Taylor action and anxiety imploded the stock, causing it to drop by 22% in the three weeks prior to the grand jury verdict.  I guess because people thought protesters were going to burn the company's headquarters or something.  Either way, the company's revenues and branch locations are still doing just fine, so I am not worried about dividend being cut.

This is the kind of action I want from my portfolio, and why I love dividend growth investing.  I could not care less about the raw dollar price of the stock.  It can do summersaults in the air and I will not bat an eye.  I have been invested for a while, and so my yield on cost was (last I calculated) somewhere in the realm of 5.7% or so, which is absolute insanity.

Smoking is a very contentious topic among multiple religions and even many non-religious.  Many investors (including yours truly) see the idea of profiting off a business that kills its best customers as repugnant, and as such wish to keep it away from their portfolios.  

I am not aware of your personal moral beliefs OP, but I would suggest a deep dive into the holdings of any ETFs you wish to purchase, to make sure you are not violating any ethical, moral, or religious beliefs you hold dear.",6,1601995725.0
t3_j63ih2,g7wk710," Dividend investing is an age old investment strategy, but is it good for anyone at all stages in life? Here I make an argument that when you're in your 20s, 30s, or even 40s. Your portfolio should be more focused on growth companies for these reasons:

1. Your money has much to gain, but not much to lose
2. Volatility of growth stocks doesn't matter in the long term
3. You don't need dividends because you have an income
4. In a bull market, growth stocks outperform dividend stocks
5. In a bear market, dividends don't save you from market drops

Unless you are in a tax advantage account you will get taxed at about 20% for qualified dividends, money that would otherwise be better off growing for you.

Yes other index funds pay a dividend but they are smaller compared to dividend focused funds and have outgrown dividend funds over the last few years 

The income you get from dividend funds when you’re playing with anything less than about $250k up is not worth the limit on growth 

Not trying to burst your bubble as I am also 24 and had a similar strategy until I looked at the numbers and tax implications.

A better method is to go aggressive on growth for the next 10 plus years and then focus on dividends.
By then your cost in yield would be higher than what you get by buying dividend funds and if anything you can sell take the 20% tax hit after you grow your account then buy dividend funds with real worth wile returns.

t3_j8lp9k,g8dp1uv,"I would imagine people on this sub are managing dividend portfolios that they keep separate from their growth/ETF portfolios. The reason why dividend investing is so popular is because the formula is simple and pays off well over a long period of time, it’s generally a good hedge against active trading portfolios with a higher risk tolerance that are trying to make money in a shorter amount of time. 

However, if you want to try and time specific pre or post ex-dividend bull or bear runs, you can always do ITM LEAP debit spreads as a hedge (against past ex-dividend if you think it’s gonna dip or call if you think there’s gonna be a run up) your dividend stocks. Just make sure it’s in a separate account and to only trade at your current level of risk tolerance for a given account. 

Obviously there’s a ton of ways to trade options, but I feel like that is a good place to start, given that every other sub about investing is basically WSB, I was almost hesitant to mention, but a lot of active traders generally manage multiple portfolios. just make sure the bulk of your money is in the lowest risk ones first and the smallest amount of money is in the highest risk and trim accordingly based on your personal risk tolerance.

STAG leases out industrial properties and collects the rent, in theory a less risky business model than that of MREITS.

t3_jaoayd,g8rkldc,"30 is too much for most people. They're probably not picking 30 good holdings but buying extra shit just to have it. I'm a little guilty there...

People need to buy the strongest companies in each sector and watch for macro trends. If you like REITs, buy 4 strong REITs and build from there. If you like tech growth or whatever, buy the few strongest since they have the capital to grow and pivot.

I also think people should go for bonds, but only managed funds (don't buy it yourself). There are some good bond funds that historically have good and enduring returns. Bonds and dates and calling can make them more complicated than most would want to handle but a well managed bond fund can give you excellent returns. They manage risk well and some of them offer like 9% sustained yield which is better than a lot of other things.

Maybe also avoid run ups. Back when people knew Microsoft was going to run the internet the stock wasn't all that high flying. But the recent tech run up is pretty crazy--though granted the last 5 years have driven high valuations everywhere.

I think it's very unusual, historically, for stocks to increase by 500% in a short time frame. Stocks have been around a long time. Low interest rates and QE had an effect but really, it's very unusual to see these kinds of increases. Parabolic stocks *always* drop. Some worse than others.",4,1602647962.0

For Income, you could just pile everything into VYM / VYMI (and some NOBL + WDIV if you like). No worries at your age, you have plenty of time to ride out volatility and take advantage of market dips. Keep in mind that long term stable / rising dividends usually imply healthy business conditions and financials (don't get me started on SPHD though).

If you're serious about dividends and income, you could think about covering all asset classes:

* PFF / PSK / EPRF for preferreds,
* ANGL / HYG / JNK for those high yield bonds,
* REET for global REIts
* VWOB / EMB for emerging market bonds,

If you've invested $4k in a taxable account and it yields 3.5%, you're looking at $140 in taxable gains taxed at probably 15%= $21 tax hit, versus $4000 in VOO with a 1.75% yield = $70 in dividends for a $10.50 tax hit - basically negligible difference.

I get that overtime the gains compound and so do the losses from taxes, but if it helps you psychologically to be in a higher yielding investment, such that when markets dip you look forward to seeing more shares being bought on each reinvestment, then SCHD could be a good choice purely for psychological reasons, even if VOO is a slightly better choice for tax reasons.",3,1602767404.0

If you are investing in high dividend stocks the price fluctuation is usually less than other ""growth"" stocks because rather than using the money the company gives it to shareholders. So you're taking part of your total returns and rather putting it toward something that generates more returns (i.e. reinvesting), you're buying stuff and paying bills -- buying more shares will generate even more money like a snowball effect.

Add to VTI every fortnight, as much as you can and retire rich some day.

VXUS is international stocks, some nice diversification to go with VTI.

VWO emerging markets ETF, not sure why you would hold this unless you really want the diversification.

VNQ is vanguards real estate ETF, you could buy REET instead and get better diversification and higher yields.

VYMI international Dividend stocks, nice to have

QYLD covered call ETF, huge dividend but steady nav loss and little upside. not sure why you would hold this one.

PGF is just preferred shares from financial institutions. Ditch for a broad market preferred ETF like PFF or buy a higher yielding preferred CEF like $FFC or $HPS.

SPHD has a shit index, ditch for more PEY

DGRO Dividend growth stocks, nice to have for yield and capital appreciation

EMB emerging market bonds, nice monthly payer, but beware of emerging market risks!

DIA you've got VTI, why would you hold the Dow Jones? Ditch this for VTI

O is a keeper and rather cheap currently. Grab MOAR

That being said the stock is a pretty fair value right now given that it hasn't really fully recovered from the drop back in March.The run up they had at the end of 2019 seemed unsustainable and I wouldn't judge that as a short term price target should things continue to improve.

t3_jh3ul4,g9xsivr,"Lots of information hope this helps.

1. If you want to set it and forget it I would prefer an ETF. The difference between ETFs and individual stocks is risk. For an ETF your money is more spread out and should typically go with the market. Individual stocks are businesses so if they go out of business that obviously changes your return. For an ETF realistically a 6-12% annual return would be about normal. But investing in 10 stocks your portfolio could fluctuate down 50% or up 50% a year. 

I would say if you do hold O it’s better to hold in a ROTH for tax reasons.

2. Nothing will clearly outperform one or the other. When I went through my options I went with VOO. But about everyone here will tell you slightly different VTI and SCHD are pretty common picks here.

3. HSA is 3x tax beneficial, Roth and 401k are 2x. Roth if your taxes will get higher over time (salary should go up over time) and 401k in specific situations if it can get you to a lower tax bracket. Another benefit often not mentioned is 401k and HSA can be taken straight from your paycheck and ROTH is manually after getting paid. So automate as much as you can unless you are a creature of habit and can handle manually.

Be sure to focus on the absolute return that you receive from your stock investment, because the dividend is only one way to profit from stocks. 

Remember that dividends, if in a taxable account, are not the most tax efficient way to make money on a stock because they are going to paid out and taxed no matter what and you incur a tax hit on that pay out whether you want to or not. With non-dividend stocks you that are perhaps higher growth and appreciate faster, *you* are in control as to when you want to sell some shares and incur the tax hit. 

Lastly, even if you have a high yield stock, if that underlying share price goes down by the amount equal or more than the yield amount, then you lost money, in absolute terms, despite it having a high dividend yield.

But unfortunately, we don't have infinite time horizons, and we look at the things every day. By not having infinite time horizons, I mean that some people have been forced to sell when it's a horrible time to do so, retirees needing to sell from IRA's during the 2003 and 2008 crashes for instance. But for most of us, we should take comfort in knowing that there are probable several decades before we need to withdraw our money, and not only that, we actually benefit from stock market declines (able to buy more for cheaper), even if our parents don't (having to sell at lower prices).

The number one thing that eases my anxiety is the fact that I'm not 100% in equities, but instead have healthy allocations to treasuries and investment grade corporates, meaning that to some extent there is always dry powder available for new purchases if the market goes down.

Also, though luck or whatever, I've taken a more bearish stance lately, raised cash levels and have been selling covered calls against some positions. So for those positions, Im actually *glad* to see declines, meaning I get to keep the premiums. As is always the case, the market didn't agree with me when I first started raising cash and kept going up, but it finally caught on.

Say, we all ""know"" the S&P will be 10,000 in 2040 (to pick a random number and random date) - we stand to make more money by investing regularly and seeing the prices fall in the iterim than we would by seeing it skyrocket up to that level immediately.",5,1603896715.0

You haven't lost money until you sell these unrealized losses.

Something like a dividend cut or suspension that effects my long term dividend growth objective is more concerning. 

My portfolios value got chopped close to 40% or something in March/April (harder than sp500 from my 20% REIT tilt) and I was stoked to use what meager investing money I had to buy in low those weeks. 
WELL, STOR, and DIS cut/suspended dividends, but I still like these companies and can appreciate their circumstances in this unparalleled time. Since then I've rode closely to the sp500 to the same dumb all time highs.

The starting yield at that time was 4-5%, it recovered closely to the sp500 (as it has a beta of .95) until now where buying into my portfolio at current evaluations is a 3% starting yield.

You get more income per tranche( buy order of stock) for the future buying dependable companies at these big dips when volatility and uncertainty scare the market, provided they don't cut or suspend their dividends. This is quite unlikely to happen in mass when you diversify, buy quality with great dividend history while not succumbing to yield chasing, keeping positions 5% and under.

 Quality, diversity, and <5% positions.

My portfolio doesn't hold any company  greater than 4% of it's total value, and I hold mostly blue chip, dividend aristocrat, industry leaders with favorable simplysafedividends/ morningstar analysis. I figure some will evaporate in my lifetime and be redistributed to the winners or I might take on potential new positions, but id like to ideally reduce my holdings to 20-30 stocks.",3,1603901753.0

As a human you have these weaknesses. People will quickly forget a recession as soon as a bull market begins. And not fear history once again as another 8-10 years uptrends in the market. Then it happens and fear and panic continues...once again.

Your situation is not unique. It’s part of being human. The professional investors are professionals because they understand having consistent and a long term horizon but most importantly, they have the mental aptitude to actually stick to it. It is easier said than done.

You will see many “investors” on say wall street bets touting their gains in the market but how many of them will hold their position if it declines 10, 20 or even 30%?

The year-by-year will miss this trend. It will recover back to the original NAV $25 given enough time and here's the reason why:

If you sell monthly covered call ATM on Nasdaq 100 yourself, you will learn that the premium is around 3.3 %, QYLD only pays 1 % of that money to you, the rest it uses to make sure the fund doesn't go down. Technically you have a driving force of growth of 2.3% per month to make sure the fund doesn't just decline and die.

The reason why it goes down because it writes ATM covered call so naturally if market is declining it will go down trying to maintain consistent income. However, since it has a driving force of going up 2.3% per month, I wouldn't worry it just decline and die like many MLPs out there.

I have significant QYLD shares and it's the main component of my FIRE strategy so I know very well about this ETF and what to expect. Happy to answer any questions about this ETF if I know the answer.

I tend to overthink about this stuff a lot and have definitely done some ""big brain"" math about how much money you need to them start earning ""x"" every dividend date/month/year etc....But at this point I find it more engaging to think about it in terms of DRIP'ing.   


So for me, I thought a good way to visualize an investment showing it's worth was setting the goal of each investment being able to buy at least one share of itself a year. Even if that's not much value over the course of a year, it's money you didn't have to spend yourself...so a win. I think I'd feel like my dividends were truly compounding if my investments bought themselves at least one share of itself per quarter.   


Currently I'm at $555 earned in dividends per year and I invest about $600 a month, so a little ""side-goal"" of mine in the next two months is to push that number of dividends to $600, so that next year I essentially get one ""free"" paycheck of passive income to invest with. That feels like a real milestone for me...but it's hard to conceptualize what that means to me for my portfolio.

I’ve been dividend investing since the 90’s and DRIPs used be a great option to reduce transaction costs when the cost of executing a trade was much higher. You could essentially avoid transaction costs with these programs. Today with near to zero cost transaction, the DRIP has less utility. As other posts have commented, you lose control of your entry price and often times it erodes your cost on yield. If you are dealing with larger sums of reinvestable dividends, you might find better value somewhere else, or at minimum a chance to better diversify your portfolio instead of increasing allocations to current holdings.

But with investing in the US I pay 15% in withholding tax to the US and then the rest to Denmark hence either 12% or 27% depending on how much you have earned.

If you taxed heavier for foreign investments, then I would try to have the main exposure in the local currency, also to minimize the currency exposure. A good alternative to picking individual foreign stocks could be to just go with an ETF to get that exposure.

With this combination, the maximum drawdown you can achieve is -10% (assuming US treasuries won't default). However, the calls allow you to have 70% of the gains of the S&P500 essentially.

From looking at market beat, market watch, and through fidelity I searched each of those tickers...I'd say those are very cheap & I'd recommend against keeping a hold on them based on their payout rates/ratios.  *(Read more if you want to hear me out).*

I remember reading this about dividend companies regarding payout ratios.  Starbucks for example has quarterly dividend at $0.45c right now.  I have 200 shares myself because of my savings over time this last...6 months ish.

Point is I think from the payout being 100% from some if not most of your holds I'd just say you will be better off with what I believe is a more stable and secure stock like SBUX.  Sure I'm biased too but I do objectively feel that they have raised their dividend over 3 years from about 30c to now 45c.  SBUX is not an aristocrat stock fine and not a REIT sure but it's got a good solid history and it's not super expensive like NVDA.

NVDA fyi is a dividend stock too if you're interested in other dividend stocks....but it's much less than SBUX so I'd say don't save up for NVDA's even if you are a gamer...the dividend is 16c per share vs SBUX it's 45c per share however SBUX is easier to get 10 shares.

Another comparison I like to draw is the payout ratio I mentioned above..but I'd like to get more in depth and I hope I can be of help saying this - look at this:  
IVR  payout ratio= 10.42% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings) and consider this 333.33% (Based on This Year's Estimates) \*\*\*all sourced from [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/IVR/dividend/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/IVR/dividend/))

  
\~\~PSEC payout ratio=  100.00% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings)   
\~\~IRM payout ratio= 107.86% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings)  
\~\~SBUX payout ratio=  57.95% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings)   
\~\~NVDA payout ratio=   13.94% (Trailing 12 Months of Earnings) 

I won't go more into that but I think that should indicate they are paying all they make back to you the investors...which I doubt/don't think this would last 10 years....or just very long.

**All in all, I'd say these will not provide long term substantial growth of your dividend stock portfolio.  Choose others that have a ""ceiling"" of 50% payout ratio.  Don't focus heavily on dividend yield percent either.**

t3_jpd5yc,gbebfxd,"First off, what does ""I want to hold IVR until it turns green"" mean?

My takeaway is that for all the other positions you're profitable, but as IVR has fallen since you've owned it, you want to stubbornly hold it in hopes of breaking even. It's an awful strategy to hold something you don't want and that's done poorly only because you don't want to sell at a loss. This is distinctly different than holding a losing position that you think will turn around.

So that said, if you are only holding onto IVR in the hope that it turns around, how much more money do you need to lose before you bite the bullet and sell? Keep in mind that the 37.54% dividend rate that showing on Yahoo is non-existent. They're just tallying up the last years worth of dividends, but you can see clearly that its been slashed.

I have nothing against holding positions that we think are temporarily impaired. I have a couple myself. But I am just warning against holding a losing position for no other reason but to not make a loss ""real"".

What I like about ROTH accounts is you can still take out how much you put in with no penalty. But if you make money in that account and you withdraw some of your gains you will be taxed. The power of compounding is huge in a Roth because you are essentially not paying the 15% tax on dividends.

2) The expense ratio. 0.46% is rather high for an ETF.  There are cheaper options available. 

3) Growth. The dividend is not growing. It fluctuates wildly and has no stability whatsoever. The fund just invests mainly in yield traps.

4) Capital appreciation. See above. Virtually no movement upwards, ensuring your only ROI are the dividends themselves. The underlying assets are not really worth much time.

If my math isn’t off, and $DIV and etfs like it recover with the economy, this could be a bargain at present prices, with the price recovering to pre-covid levels (50% gain) plus monthly dividends, which can compound. Assuming they can keep the payments up of course.

t3_jr1cif,gbx8s11,"I was taught something very different than I discovered to be true. What struck me is that you want to retire at 55, and implement an income investment strategy as part of your achieving that goal. 

Ironically, I recently read, that in the US, a retirement literacy test was given to a broad cross section of ages and income levels. Something like, 84% failed horribly. The question missed frequently across all groups was life expectancy. People live a lot longer than they used to, and with the near exponential growth in innovation that will ultimately (imo) prove longstanding and widely adopted strategies. The 60/40 growth/income portfolio for example. Even before the virus altered the financial landscape, there were was a recent period when Bonds weren’t functioning as a hedge against the drop of the Portfolio’s 40% equity allotment. 

Do you have enough to live comfortably, assuming the trajectory you’ve mapped out succeeds if you live 10 years longer than you think you will? 

Ray Dalio (Bridgewater and assoc), and Cathy Woods from Ark Invest are two of my “gurus”. I’m 38, and aside from investing done on my behalf as a child to help pay for college, I did not personally trade or invest until March 2019. I love every part of it. Of all the material I’ve poured through, not once did I hear about any successful strategies involving 50 income yielding stocks working out for us borderline millennials :) 

I have had the best luck with maintaining 5 primary accounts, each with a different strategy. Grow stocks are what will most likely get you the returns needed for a long retirement (imo), but they are riskier and volatile. 

Hence, the 2nd account is to protect my assets from a sudden drop, like we saw in March. Ray Dario’s Risk Parity aka Pure Alpha fund has been my most rewarding account. Based on my age I did adjust the weightings toward equities, not by more than 3-5 % depending on when I rebalance. It’s a fantastic theory. Basically the 60/40 many baby boomers were pushed into by their brokers doesn’t take account for the inherent weighting of risks that equities have. So it raises the question: is adjusting the allotment to 40% enough to reduce risk relative to the 60% of Bonds? 

Dalio found the following to get a very balanced weighting across across a more diverse portfolio . From my experience, if it is ever down for the day when a significant drop occurs, it’s by less than a point, and moreover, it yields a consistent 15–17%. I don’t know all the rules in the group here, so I won’t mention the specific institution I use, but it is one that makes rebalancing the simplest process imaginable. 
-20% equities 
-40% Long term bonds 
-10% medium duration bonds 
-7.5% gold 

As to be expected, when looking at his hedge fund’s required filings for anything over 10,000, foreign companies and ETF’s had replaced the bonds. As he said on tv, cash is trash. At near 0% interest rates in the us, when you factor inflation in, it’s like paying to lose your money slowly lol. I found a basic version of it and had this specific bundle until Covid: 
10 %Vanguard’s growth geared s&p 500 etf 
10 % Vanguard total stock market etf
40 %I shares 40 plus years US treasury bond etf
10% I shares 10 year US treasury bonds etf
7.5% SPDR’s gold etf 
7.5% The investco commodities etf. 

401k and Roth IRA (for mutual funds, and I don’t manage the 401k)

A robo account to protect against any other subconscious bias or emotion when decision making on the ones I manage, and lastly...a brokerage account for trading options contracts and short term high yield stock plays. 

Woods’s ark invest has 5-7 managed ETF’s, actively managed and transparent. They post their daily purchases and sells. And she does great YouTube market updates. All investments are premised on the notion that they are so innovative and disruptive that they will average a 15% ROI, which results in a doubling of initial investment after 5 years! People called her crazy when ARK invested so much in Tesla it became their largest position. 

Lastly, Ray Dalio says playing the market is like betting. Bet a little here, a little there, and you have a better chance of walking out with something than letting it all ride on bet. My stolen advice is to devise a more diverse strategy that involves as many uncorrelated bets as you can to accomplish your goals. 
++Many High Growth stalls pay a high dividend, so you get income there too. The income I generate day to day is from playing in the options market. Just started reading up on it and while I’ve heard people say it’s too risky, when you do the research, have your own strategy, and have confidence you have a pulse on whether a stock will increase, decrease, or stay flat, then for a lot less money you can turn a quick profit, go long and buy out of the money call options because you know down the road the respective stock will be above the chosen strike price. 

Best of luck, sorry for the novel, I relate to getting started late and it took a lot of research to structure my investments, but I personally love doing it. If you want to reap dividends from well established companies and reinvest them so it’s growing in shares w/out checking the market 10 times during trading hours, more power to you!

\-Reaching 4 full shares of a stock! This one is my favorite because whatever stock's dividend yield is, is what you will receive every time they pay out!

\-10 full shares- in your case youll be getting probably $5-$10 every time they pay out, thats real money!

\-16 Full shares- This to me BIG, its where dividend/DRIP shows some visible movement to your portfolio.

However, I am pulling in $1,100 a month ($13,200 a year) in dividends, with an investment of about $260K in dividend stocks... so you can kinda say that in certain states, I could almost live off dividends. 

At my full time job I make $85,000 a year so dividend income certainly hasn’t replaced that income, but I recently DID quit my second job of 23 years where I was making $20,000 a year. So, the dividend income allowed me to go from working 75 hours a week to about 50 hours a week.

HSA is pre tax money, tax free growth, and can be withdrawn tax free for qualified health expenses or with income tax for non qualified withdrawals at age 65. 

Roth IRA is post tax money, tax free growth, and tax free withdrawals. 

Either way, you won’t be paying tax on the growth as it happens per se. But with HSA you pay tax either not at all (for qualified expenses) or on withdrawal (if not qualified), and with Roth you’ll pay taxes prior to contributing. 

So you can invest in dividend stocks in either or both accounts if you want, and there are advantages to this over doing it in a brokerage account due to tax free growth. 

But before you do this, just consider whether you want to invest a substantial amount in dividend stocks rather than the total market, as most people would recommend against such a strategy. It decreases diversification. Also, one nice thing about dividend stocks in a brokerage account is taking some of the dividends to supplement your income - in the HSA or Roth IRA, you won’t be able to touch the dividend money without a penalty.",6,1605125909.0

2-Cash is King, in all contexts. Companies manipulate data all the time, but a cash or DRIP dividend cannot be ""fudged"". Dividends are a more accurate and honest metric than any other, in my book.  

3-REIT's, MLP's, and BDC's should be included for discussion in your intro. Their structures are built to include dividends and dividends are not really optional for these.

The dividend hasn't increased from its last cut in 2017 and its ATH was over a decade ago (2006/7 IIRC). You can count on the stability and reliable dividends if you're chasing the dividends like me. Long term parking your money could be bad if they chop their dividends again.",3,1605188316.0

t3_jtmvb1,gc7q2x2,"u/WildRiceParadiseWhat I usually suggest to friends is think about what you want to do or where you are at in your life. If you are just beginning investing and have 15+ years, I would prioritize growth ETFs/growth appreciation stocks. These dividend paying ETFs typically have lower dividends (<1% usually) so I always say add a good ""dividend growth"" stock or ETF in there (like DGRO/DGRW/VIG/ etc..). Consistent dividend growth should be prioritized along with good companies. I wouldn't call it a secret as it's usually touched on dividend investing guides/books/PDFs/etc. Look for stocks that yield at least 2.5% with a dividend growth % over the last few years of at least 7% (you can look up stocks on seekingalpha and then click dividends --> dividend growth). This will double your money in approx 10 years on the dividend growth alone, regardless of how much the stock appreciates. Avoid most dividend stocks >6 or 7% yield unless you are retired and don't care about 0% growth in the stock, just the dividend. You can usually find some great reliable/high quality stocks with yields between 2.5-5%. Any higher and usually there is negligible growth appreciation (sideways trader) so all of your earnings come only from the dividends and not by selling them eventually for profits.

Check out the dividend Aristocrat list, and the dividend contenders/challengers/champions list as well.  


\*\*And to somewhat answer your original post haha:

usually stocks will announce their upcoming dividend sometime before. Sometimes for monthly paying stocks they will announce the next 3 dividends (for that quarter). To calculate it, take the exact amount (#) of shares you have for that particular stock (including fractional shares) and then (x) it by the dividend payout. Remember if you utilize DRIP auto reinvesting from the payout, that amount of dividend you get on the next payout will be slightly higher, then the next will be slightly higher and so on-so forth. This is why DRIP/compound investing is invaluable to long term gains (if you aren't spending the dividends, but reinvesting them).",9,1605318679.0

As others have mentioned, find the company's dividend history and its most recent dividend, or its most recently announced dividend even if it hasn't been paid yet.

If quarterly, multiply this most recent dividend amount by 4. If paid monthly, multiply it by 12. This is its annualized (not annual) dividend

Divide this by the current price of the company. This will be the current yield.

So right now with MSFT, the next dividend to be paid Dec 10 is $.56 and its current price is $215.97, so its current annualized yield is (.56 X 4)/215.97 = 1.04%",3,1605557599.0

It depends on the fees and some other minor things. For example, mine doesn't let me buy some chinese stocks and some defense stocks like Lockheed Martin for moral reasons.

I recommend to start with the safest companies even if at this moment they are not specially cheap.
T is cheap because they have a ton of debt. But the dividend is crazy good

JNJ is nearly the perfect stock

RTX has the dividend reduced, but since corona crisis affects them, could be also ""cheap""

Abbvie, I don't have stocks, but it's on my watchlist. Very Good company 

KO, don't expect much grow, but it's may be the safest company you can find

CVS has debt but a lot of potential and is well managed

Realty Income is a REIT. Very good choice. It's one of our favorite reits. 

There are other companies, the big tech, they give you a dividend, but it's so small... It's not worth it for the dividend. Companies like Apple, MSFT or Visa. 

Then, I would look to European companies. Not that overbought in general like US companies. 

You can also check utilities companies or energy clmpanies, but some of them are ducked or at least some people think that way. Others think they're an steal. Companies like Conoco, Xom, Chevron or im Europe Total, Shell or Repsol. 

Your returns depend on the money you put in

A company with +3% yield is a very good one. 

More than 6/7% is suspicious, like ExxonMobil, Enbridge or some Reits. I think T is at 7% now. Mlre than 10% is a red flag in my humble opinion. 


The thing is to begin. Then you'll see thru the years how the reinvesting works and the snow ball effect begins to work. 

Imma give my example. I began with 60 shares of T, and reinvesting dividends now I have 125 shares 

I began with 38 shares of Bayer. Now I have 60

CVS began with 30 and now I have 35

Magna International I began with 70 and now I have 104

Volkswagen 16 to 21 shares

And the others I can't remember but I bought more Visa, Microsoft, raytheon, Realty Income. 

I even put some dividends in speculative personal bets like Virgin or Palantir

1. Personally for me, regardless of conditions, there is no change in plan/strategy. As an individual with a stable income, high job security, and a decent emergency fund, I am always 100% equities and there will be no change in buying more or less. I do not give a fuck about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, ""all time highs"", ""all time lows"" or wherever the fuck we are on the ""graph"". I do not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, I really do not give two shits. Volatility does not mean anything to me since I am a super long-term investor and I do not respect it or fear it;
2. I'm not a smart person, I am not an educated person, I cannot predict the future, and I cannot time the market. Personally, I believe that time in the market is superior to timing the market (as per academic studies). Therefore, I invest on average, half of my pay, every time I get paid (i.e. every two weeks) because I am boring, I do not give a fuck about market volatility, and I do not have materialistic wants or needs;
3. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people here want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage and as long as you have a long time horizon. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity and do not panic. Embrace this shit since everything goes on sale; and therefore, you get to buy more shit at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them with open arms and let the weak minded people panic sell to you;
4. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is ""different"" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks;
5. Finally, for me, the biggest point is to stop giving a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in your plan to buy well-established, high-quality, companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record or a globally diversified index ETF every two weeks until you retire or die (at least I will be).

For even more confidence, only look at those that have      increased   their dividends for over 12 years, which covers the last   recession.

t3_jtf6fy,gc67suc,">From what I understand, dividend investing is like buying a piece of a company, that will pay me out monthly/ yearly dividends. This appeals to me a lot more than buying stocks because until you actually withdraw money from a stock it’s not real money, and as soon as you do, there’s the opportunity cost to consider.

Dividend investing is still buying stocks. Or you buy an etf or mutual fund, which is just a basket full of stocks that you can buy.

There are two basic ways that stocks return value to you as a shareholder. 

* They can go up in price (called capital appreciation, or capital gains). This is common with companies that choose to reinvest all of their profits into the company, or who issue stock buybacks.
* They can take some or all of their profits and return it to shareholders directly as a dividend payment. This means less money is being reinvested into the company, since some of the profit is being returned to shareholders directly.

Both of them are good.

>what’s the best platform to buy dividends on?

As mentioned, you don't buy ""dividends"", you buy dividend yielding stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds.

Personally, I use several platforms. I think the best for buy and hold dividend investing is M1 finance. You set up a ""pie"" of stocks you want to purchase, then you set up periodic investments, and it will buy fractional shares of stocks based on the ratio you set up.

>What dividends would ye recommend to start off on

Driving it home again - you don't buy dividends, you buy dividend yielding securities.

Personally, I would start with index etfs like VTI, or stick with the [dividend aristocrats](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-aristocrats/).

>Website/ subreddits/ news sources for further study

If you are this new, I'd recommend getting your legs under you. /r/personalfinance, /r/investing, /r/financialindependence are all good. Also read ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" and Bogle's ""Little Book of Common Sense Investing"".

>How much monthly investment and for how long would return dividends of, say, $10 a month? All help is much appreciated!

That depends entirely on your choice of security. Suppose you chose VTI. 

$10 a month \* 12 months in a year = $120 per year

VTI seems to average about a $.65 distribution every quarter. There's 4 quarters in a year, so that's .65\*4 = $2.60 average dividends per share per year. So, $120 per year goal / $2.60 per year per share = 47 shares of VTI you would need to buy. At today's prices, that would be $**8570.45.**

Assuming you are investing $100 per week and prices never change, it will take you about 86 weeks (8570/100) to get there.

Now suppose you chose VYM. Current price, $87.49. Quarterly distribution averaging around $.65 per share, again, about $2.60 per year. So, $120/$2.60 again gives us 47 shares, this time of VYM. Meaning an investment of **4112.97**. At $100 per week, assuming prices never move, that's 42 weeks.

Both roads get you there, and there are pros and cons for both approaches. But that takes time and experience. Just stay away from the siren song of 10+% dividend yields. They can burn you pretty badly.

Now, one other thing to consider on all of this is taxes. I'm not sure where you are posting from, so I can't really give you guidance without making some big assumptions.",2,1605289927.0

Look into these, im in all of them

Mfa(mortgage and real estate related)

Pty(gonna wanna google this and the next one yourself)

Pdt

Evv(debt related)

Qcln(clean energy focus very strongk)

Hail(autonomous driving and clean energy focus split)

-extremely income focused monthly dividend payer (which can either be taken as monthly income or it can be dripped back into more shares avoiding tax until sold)

-callwriting nasdaq strategy 

-extremely well valued mortgage shares with great dividends every three months, just starting a breakout (MFA)

t3_jufu4f,gccbkqj,"I feel obligated to give my input as for the pros of banks:  


\- Credit unions are often local. This doesn't sound like a con for many who would want to stay at the same area their whole life. If you happen to travel a lot or are on the younger side, You may not want to stay in the same state/country throughout your working life. The convenience factor of seeing a Chase/Santander/etc in every state is rather comforting.

\- Products: Banks can usually offer more, both investment product wise and instrument-wise (business credit cards/business loans) . More doesnt always mean better, but I like seeing my options.

\- Non-exclusivity- Banks dont typically have a ""field of membership"" like Credit unions do. Credit unions want to limit their customer base. AKA typically region or community limited

\- Mobile apps, ATMs, etc. Big banks will often have better mobile applications. Credit unions tend to be a lot slower with the tech side. Being widespread does have its advantages after all. But do research as credit unions can mimic this with mutual agreements.

IE- list what you want out of banks/credit unions before making the choice. I like my technology and global scaling more than I care for the community and customer service aspects. This may not be the same for everyone. Just doing my devil's advocate work",62,1605416092.0

A company like IP has a 5 year growth rate of over 6% and ABBV has a 5 year growth rate over 20%. 

IP has an 11 year streak and ABBV a 7 year streak of raising dividends but they may end up being a better buy (not to say they are or aren’t, just an example).

Now I know this sub’s main focus is dividends BUT I really think that young investors are cheating themselves by focusing on dividends too early. Especially in the kind of insane bull market we’re in right now. 

When you’re young focus on growth stocks. Take a little risk and build your nest egg. Learn to make money selling options in tech stock. When you get to the point where you have enough money that the prospect of losing it makes you nervous move some over into safer div stock. 

Chances are your company’s 401k limits your selection to a few mutual funds. If you want safe div stock get it there. Shoot for higher returns with your extra cash. 

All that said I think WMT is poised for a growth spurt in the next few years and could accomplish both goals.

I have a foreign registration on this company in my home state so I can legally do business here. I run all my income through that company so I have it set up to be taxed as an S Corp to save on taxes. With an LLC 100% of the income gets passed to the owner at the full freight income tax rate + self employment tax. But as a S Corp I pay myself a salary from the company which is taxed at my income tax rate, then the rest is taxed as a dividend distribution to me. 

That company owns stock, startups, small companies, and real estate. On top of that I have a business LegalShied membership which gives me access to a corporate lawyer for whatever I need at a fixed monthly rate rather than having to keep one on retainer. All of this is doable in your own, I learned how to do all of that from Google. 

As far as doing it living in a different country, I'm not sure how that would work out. I'm sure it's doable but your best bet would be talking to an attorney to help you through the details. Getting money out of the country and in to your bank account is likely where you'll have the biggest issue.

Something to be aware of: Magic the Gathering is a significant part of Hasbro's overall revenue and growth strategy - it's one of their ""franchise brands"", a sector that makes up more than half of the company's revenue. The specific brands are not broken down in the shareholder report but by inference I'd guess MtG is by far their most valuable franchise.

Hasbro has the stated goal of [doubling revenue from MtG](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/j7czsn/hasbro_goal_double_wotc_revenue_will_this_destroy/) over the next 5 years. The game has a large, committed global player base with a lot of stickiness but people are becoming worried.

Hasbro's growth strategy involves an increasing pace of new product releases, more premium/foil/fancy cards to appeal to whales, and so on to better and better monetize from this committed base of players. However, perception of corporate management by the player base is steadily declining: support for competitive formats is dropping, controversial design decisions for the most popular formats leading to poor balance and frequent banning of cards, move toward a digital platform when the game has previously been all face-to-face, etc. 

I'm trying to keep this as objective as possible and so someone not part of this community can get the issue, but basically many MtG players are getting increasingly pissed at how hard this franchise is being monetized. 

There's also an implicit competitor to Hasbro's MtG card production which are fake, counterfeit cards produced in China which are much cheaper and becoming increasingly good at imitating the real thing.

Hasbro is already at an over 75% payout ratio on dividends. They also have a pretty high amount of debt. A significant risk factor to the company's future is that milking this beloved franchise will blow up in their faces. And I don't see My Little Pony or Transformers suddenly stepping in to replace that revenue.

TLDR from the customer side, Hasbro appears to be mismanaging one of their most valuable segments currently and I could see it really blowing up in their face 3-5 years down the road.",11,1606018454.0

In my business account, I hold SPHD, PEY, STAG. I did hold SPLV for a bit, but after a bit of research, I realized how much it has underperformed the broad market even with dividends. I sold it off and bought AAPL and VTI.

t3_jz1ds0,gd9bfoa,"I was on the same boat as you, but then I realized I could have a more stable and larger income with the same investment using options. 

My strategy is ""The Wheel"" or ""Triple Income investing"" (which I've modified to be Pentuple income investing). 

I'll break down as simple as possible for those new to the concept. 

I pick a stock that has a dividend pay out that I wouldn't mind holding. Then I sell a ""Cash Covered Put"" what this is, is essentially me going to someone with 100 shares of the stock and saying ""Hey your stock is gonna go up"" and they say ""I'm not so sure"". So I sell them insurance. They pay a ""Premium"" and if the stock falls below the ""Strike Price"" we agree on, I HAVE to buy the shares at the strike price, regardless of how low it goes. Now if it doesn't go below the strike price, I keep the premium, they keep the shares.

The goal in this first step is to NOT get assigned the shares, so you tend to be conservative with the put. However, with $5k cash on hand, you can expect around $100 in premium per week playing relatively safe puts. You're never going to get a dividend return like that. 

Now, IF I lose (and it does happen) I will be assigned the shares. Oh well. I overpaid for some stock, hopefully not by a lot. (Remember I have to buy regardless of how low it goes). Now that I have the stock, I can eat the loss and start again, or I can do the second step of the wheel. 

Step 2: I use those shares to sell a ""Covered Call"". This is where I go to someone who wants to BUY 100 shares of the stock I hold, and they think it's gonna go up by a lot. I say ""Ya right"" and then sell them the opportunity to buy the shares at a lower strike price than they think it will get to. They pay me a premium for this opportunity. 

Once again, if the shares reach above the strike price, I am obligated to sell them at the strike price, regardless of how high it goes. If the shares do not reach the strike when the contract expires, I keep them and the premium. 

The goal again can be to sell or not sell depending on how much I like the stock. 

Once I'm wrong on this part of the wheel, I sell the shares at the strike price, which is ideally more than I paid in the first step. Meaning I got premium from Step 1 and Step 2 and then income from the sale in the call. AKA - Triple income. 

How I modify it is pretty simple. I pick stocks that pay dividends. When the Ex date is coming up, I make the goal to get assigned or keep the shares, so I can collect the dividend payment as well as premium. (That's income source 4). 

Then I take all premium and gains and use them to invest into ""Safe Bet"" dividend payers - (Income source 5). 


It is much riskier than playing the dividend game, but if you're young and have time to bounce back from a loss - and of course you don't use ALL your money to play this strategy, you should theoretically come out ahead more times than you lose. You'll be able to collect a pretty decent amount weekly, and over time build positions much, much faster. 

The downside - If an event like march happens, you're going to lose BIG, but at the end of the day, for better or worse, you'll still get assigned some shares of stock. So long as the company does not go out of business, you'll live to fight another day - and let's be real if you were holding dividend stocks during an event like covid crash you were gonna lose big anyway.",76,1606077301.0

As for why they're maybe not the best, well a dividend is a portion of the profits paid to investors. If you're essentially just giving money away, you have less to use for growth. It is however advantageous for the investor as it allows you to ""Profit take"" and deploy that cash elsewhere - including reinvesting in the company by way of purchasing more shares.

Dividends are not ""extra money,"" it comes out of your equity. If you are paid $1000 in dividends in a quarter, your equity in stocks decreases by $1000, and your cash balance increases by $1000. This can be re-invested to buy more shares, resulting in you owning more shares of the companies that have paid out, but your returns have stayed the same. There is no numerical advantage to owning more inexpensive shares of a company than owning fewer more expensive shares of a company. 

So long as $1 is $1, it is irrelevant where you receive it in the form of capital appreciation or a dividend, especially if you plan to immediately DRIP it back into the stock.

 Many investors want to buy their shares before the ex-dividend date in order to ensure that they are eligible to receive the upcoming dividend. However, if you find yourself buying shares and realizing that you missed the ex-dividend date, you may not have missed out as much as you thought.

The reason for this is that share prices usually drop by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. **This makes sense because the company’s assets will soon be declining by the amount of the dividend.**

Because stocks usually decline in price on the ex-dividend date, you may not be worse off if you missed your chance to buy beforehand.

For example, if a company announces a dividend equivalent to 2% of its stock price, its stock will typically decline by 2% on the ex-dividend date. Therefore, if you bought the shares on or shortly after the ex-dividend date, you probably obtained a “discount” of about 2% relative to the price you would have paid shortly before.

t3_k1kc72,gdpithq,"I’ve seen a lot of good explanations here already, but I’ll throw another one in there. I’m trying to r/ELI5 this a bit for simplicity’s sake. I’m sure you know most of the details already, but sometimes helps to reimagine them.

Obviously, living off dividends vs. living of selling stocks are both perfectly viable strategies. Dividend investors typically choose that route for exactly the reasons you described, and it’s a very viable strategy that works for millions of people.

But a really important consideration is that you can’t focus exclusively on the finished product. Of course any investor, of any strategy, would prefer not to sell anything from their portfolio. But they accept that manner of income because they believe they will get better returns.

So if, right now, a genie is offering a retiree a $2,000,000 dividend portfolio or a $2,000,000 growt-stocks portfolio. It would be sensible to take the dividends because they didn’t need to work harder/longer for it. But If yo’re starting from scratch, it might take longer to get to the Crossover point for a dividend investor than it would for a growth investor.

To that end, I think the answer to your question “why would I want to keep selling shares for income instead of dividends” is: because it has the potential to grow faster and get to the magic retirement value sooner than DRIP investing would.

Remember, when selling stocks, investors often aim to sell off in an amount that appreciation will make back. So the value of the account might not even change by the end or each year (assuming the Crossover point model for generational investing, not a solo-retiree who might be okay deplete their savings). 

And while it might be weird to visualize. Consider the law of large numbers. If it takes me 100 stock sales a month to fund my lifestyle, and I have 400,000 stocks,  I’m not going to be particularly worried about “running out”. Especially because next year those 398,800 stocks might be worth the same amount as 400,000 stocks were worth the year before.

It’s a weird thought experiment, but separate the concept of “number of stocks” from “value of portfolio”. If your portfolio has enough money in it to retire, or (if you want to pass it on for generations) enough money in it to keep growing faster than you’re spending it, then the number of stocks doesn’t matter until it’s 0. And when you use only tiny fractions of the account (law of large numbers, so to speak), that’s essentially never.

So the growth investor is betting that their growth stocks and ETFs will reach that magic retirement number faster than DRIP investors. They might be right or they might be wrong. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future success. But it has been that way before, and they’re banking on it happening again.

Regardless of the investment strategy, both groups hope to find a medium where the returns (either by dividends or equity selloff) will replenish. And most groups usually have similar success in that regard",21,1606429074.0

t3_k1kc72,gdpbw3q,"I swapped from doing ONLY dividend stocks to growth stocks as I started seeing what if I put in growth at the start what the numbers would be. Definitely missed out on money not doing growth.

I kept all my dividend stocks though - so I have a mix of both. I get about $12k in dividends a year, I no longer drip that. I take the dividends and throw it into growth stocks as well as my contributions.

When I retire and there is a market downturn and my dividend stocks keep paying I don't have to sell off as much for that year or two. So the dividends will help some.

As to your question - if you pick good stocks of EFT - and they grow a lot it is better than div stocks.

Lets give an example not based in real stocks or numbers - but this is what i saw.

I was putting say 10k in dividen stocks. and they were returning around $900 a year in dividends. I was using drip so it would get reinvested back in. In 6 years time I was still getting around $1,100 in divdends a year from this one investment and I was worth about $13k after 6 years. So I gained $3k

Had I put that same $10k into say vtsax I think was at $42 a share, 6 years later the value would be at $21,000. More than double what I put in.   I could sell off $8,000 in that stock and still be right at where the dividend stock is (even with drip).  Now if you can get a mix of dividend stock that also grows - great like O. But even with O had I put 10k in O with drip 6 years ago and $10k in vtsax, I would have more money with vtsax.

So in a growth stock or fund, hopefully you get a decent rate of return. By the time you are ready to sell you money is 3-4 times as much as you put in. As you slowly sell that stock off the value should keep going up year after year. so you pick an amount to sell off every year to stretch going to zero for say 30 years or so.

And there is no grantee a dividend stock won't cut a dividend or stop paying a dividend. Both have happened to a few of my dividend stocks this year.

I do still like dividend stocks but I no longer buy them. That $12k a year I make from dividends go for growth stocks. And i also put cash aside. the goal is not to have to sell shares in a down turn year. Dividends and cash until a market correction and then go back to selling shares.",11,1606425049.0

t3_k1gh42,gdo7h4u,"Nintendo. Also it’s best to pick them up on years they do terrible. Nintendo can’t be beat even on their terrible years. Their goal is to be profitable both with their games and their consoles. They have enough money from all their profits to fail for 100 years in a row and still have money left over to fail. So they have the best chance at succeeding in subsequent years 

They always have a fresh supply of consumers aka kids and they always have adults seeking nostalgia and/or are gamers themselves. They have consumers out there who played the Wii who in a few gens might pick up one of Nintendo’s consoles for multipurpose uses 

As for the others CD projekt red doesn’t have that brand appeal with their own name only the games they supply so when someone picks up the Witcher they don’t really automatically think of CD unlike Nintendo when you pull any of their staple games you think Nintendo. 

One of the best things about Blizzard is exactly what the other guy said. They have such a high loyalty base you can’t go wrong there. But Blizzard however is a bit niche as a company. It’s only recently that they’ve been branching out into other gaming genres and so far it’s helping them immensely. That coupled with the 10-20 year wait by the fan base for a quality game title  is impressive. However one of the problems now is one of the main leadership folks stepped down recently and fans have started to pull out because instead of being Blizzard and Actvision working together as partners it’s becoming more of the former Actvision cash grab which is turning off a lot of the loyal fan base (and is not a smart idea and why you don’t see Nintendo pulling an EA micro transaction on everything they own)

Ubisoft I like because they like Nintendo try to be innovative by taking risks to support different types of game genres and platforms. We wouldn’t have seen Assassin’s Creed or Rayman if they didn’t.  However one of their problems is they tend to milk a series excessively. Instead of doing what Nintendo does aka using their mascots in other genres and creating a staple brand Ubisoft creates the same game type with their characters to the point where the series becomes very stale in a short amount of time. The other thing is they tend to have a net loss overall partly because they’re paying for AAA titles and some titles struggle to hit that break even point",7,1606405843.0

  28 years old, government job with a great pension plan, $35k in a separate retirement portfolio fund that tracks the NASDAQ. $20k in my reno/rainy account. This stuff is not being touched.

  However I have an account with $12k that is for individual stocks. This is the account I struggle to create a proper strategy for. Below is how I rationalize my portfolio decisions instead of yolo throwing money at meme stocks.I picture the stock market as a party. Not saying I invented this thought process, but stick with me..

Everyones at this party. 

  You've got your popular, wild and unpredictable crowd who are the life of the party, but sometimes breaks stuff or throws up on your couch. (TSLA, PLTR, NIO, etc..).
 
  You've got your cool, fun loving crowd that keeps 
you on your toes (FAANG, etc...). 
 
  Then theres your every day, average joe crowd that nobody has beef with but aren't overly excited to have there either (JNJ, MMM, LMT, etc...). 
  
  Finally there are the wallflowers, nerds and weirdos. This crowd is either ostracized, ignored or simply hated (GIS, MO, T, HSY, CPB, etc...). Some of them just don't make themselves noticed, some of them aren't trendy enough to hang with and seem out of touch with the theme of the party. Others are simply hated and are picked on and pushed around.

The point of all of this is to ask yourself one question.

You are the owner of the house, it's your party. Who's getting invited and why?

 Do you want to have an extravagant party with the most wild, popular crowd you can imagine, knowing that it could get broken up at any moment (TSLA PE 1000+ lol). Or is a more chilled out party with no chance of noise complaints, drama or puke more your thing?

Neither is wrong in my humble opinion, both have their time and place, as well as healthy amounts at every party. I want my party to be fun (ETSY, SQ) but I don't want to risk burning my house down in the process. I want a mix of everyone at my party. I dont want everyone there to be a bunch of wall flowers sitting around not doing anything most of the time (GIS, MO, HSY, etc...). Always good to have some old faithful friends there too who can still have fun (WMT, JNJ, LMT, AAPL, etc...).

I would like to know your thoughts on the future of railroads. Currently, I am confidently overweight in holding Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI, TSX: [CNR.TO](https://CNR.TO)) within my portfolio and I believe that this company will be a dividend paying monster in 25-50 years as I lock in these future yields on cost. Here is why I am very confident in this company:

1. Wide economic moat and duopoly in Canada with extremely high barrier of entry due to capital costs with an extensive network which also penetrates and operates in the United States of America;
2. Dividend growth company with proven track record;
3. 100 years of business experience through tough times like wars and real economic recessions;
4. Low payout ratio and dividend yield with a lot of room to increase dividend for the next 25-50 years; 
5. Rail is the most efficient means of transporting physical goods over vast expanses of land with no foreseeable change in the future unless some drastic technologies and/or scientific discoveries are made; and
6. I believe that anyone who thinks that self-driving trucks will be able to transport grains, forestry products, bulk materials, and/or other physical goods on a large macroscopic scale is delusional from a transportation engineering perspective, economic productivity perspective, traffic load perspective, and infrastructure maintenance perspective.

What's your current view on Main Street capital? You seemed to have removed it from your portfolio a few months ago, but i don't believe you went in depth as to why in a video.

The reason i^m asking is because MAIN hasn't cut their dividend, and while their stock price was hit in march, they have recovered steadily and their book value is fairly close to what they are trading at. From what i see, the company is doing as well as can be expected in these times, so i don't really understand why you chose to remove it.

t3_k2srtp,gdxvp9x,"Personally not a huge fan of Walmart, not because they are a bad company but because they are already so huge. Sales growth of 2.2% over the past 5 years is weak, but that's also not really their fault given how big they are. 

They can continue to expand into e-commerce, but that will probably shrink their margins and increase their Capex. Plus, if some customers start using their delivery and online services more instead of just always visiting the store, their e-commerce sales grow but the overall top line revenue remains about the same. 

Their dividend yield and growth rate are also weak, despite their payout ratio based on FCF being in the mid to upper 30% range over the past several years. They're also kind of overvalued right now, and it seems like the stock has already priced in increased e-commerce sales for the next several years. Even with the pop in stock price and momentum behind e-commerce expansion, they've still underperformed SPY over the past 10 years on total return.

Dividends allow you to tangibly actualize gains. Lower risk/reward also isn't a bad thing for some people. When the market crashed in March, dividend collectors continued getting paid as usual. The market recovered quickly this time, but it doesn't always. What happens if we hit a genuine multi year recession and growth companies are down for years? Dividend collectors are almost wholly unphased by downturns.

Ultimately, for most dividend investors, the goal is to build a portfolio to pay enough to live off of, allowing them to never have to sell a position, and be able to be paid in perpetuity. And as you get older, they get dramatically more important. You'd be foolish to be 60 and still rolling the dice on penny stocks. Dividend stocks tend to be much more stable.

(1) Cash from dividends cannot be obscured by accounting tricks, it's money the company has earned and put into your pocket

(2) Stock buybacks can also reflect the directors interests if they have stock options triggered at some specific stock price; they might destroy shareholder value for a temporary price bump. Not possible with dividends

(3) Companies sitting on a huge pile of cash can cause them to expand in unprofitable ways; the marginal value of extra investment is tilted by having available capital that has not been distributed. Dividends can keep a company focused

(4) Long history of dividend payments is a strong signal of a durable business model, and if a company can keep increasing the dividend every year it indicates the company is still healthy - as opposed to a high stock price alone, which means nothing by itself.

Sure, it's one more step, but I don't think about reinvesting unless I want to, not because I *have* to. DRIP gives me peace of mind, as I know compounding isn't interrupted unless I sell shares myself to reinvest.   


I don't mind doing a little DD (or even RSI tracking), allowing all of my positions to grow themselves, and selectively selling the over valued ones to buy the undervalued ones.

t3_k4dyx5,ge8z1bc,"Lots of ways to do this.  Might make sense to speak with a tax professional.

Simplest way may be to move your portfolio into some type of entity (trust or LLC) and add your children to that entity.

In the case of a LLC you could just pay out the funds as dividends to all owners of the LLC.  At some point your children would take full ownership and their dividend would increase.

Keep in mind the big taxable event here would be if they take ownership of the whole portfolio from you.  If they are joint/partial owners prior (such as joint account holders with survivorship) I would imagine the burden would be less.",6,1606820736.0

So it’s best to act like today is the last day. Who do you want to have what and how much of it. I would certainly open a trust, have the account be under that trust and the person executing the will has all the rules and guidelines set up. Like the fam friends that said you can only use the dividends. That way you don’t have them destroy what you built. 

I also recommend changing the name on the deed of your house under a trust as well. To avoid the death tax or having the bank call the loan on your kids and then being unable to pay it and are forced to sell. But be careful in some states if you do this the bank could consider this a transaction and could call the loan on you so you need to be familiar with what you can and can’t do to avoid getting into any messes.

t3_k5lpti,gegj65w,"Auto land is nice, but it’s of questionable value. It’s a great feature to have on an airplane, and it can be of tremendous value so long as it’s properly utilized. However, most general aviation airplanes that are still around today were built in the 60s and 70s. Retrofitting this system into them is hideously expensive and I’m sure retrofits will number well under 100 a year. 

It could be a nice option in new built planes, but again, it’s a very expensive option, on top of the fact that GA total shipments aren’t that high on an annual basis. 

Furthermore, the real money in avionics is in the airline/businesses airplane segment. Garmin can make inroads here, but there are already very well established players that have several decades worth of designing autoflight systems.

Unless they change their philosophy, adoption of this feature will be seriously limited due to the fact that OEMs have enough other things for their flight test program that they don’t need to spend more money testing things for a feature that is still very much in its infancy",5,1606966678.0

I would also be cautious about the DOW fund. They seem poised to underperform for a while. It seems too selective and still just tracks an index.

An ADR/ADS is a bank issued certificate that guarantees you the performance and distributions of a foreign stock (i.e. bank owns the stock, but guarantees you that it passes along all gains to you). Since you might not be able to trade this stock on on its native exchange, this might be the only way you get access to it. This guarantee is then traded on a different exchange by the bank to investors.

One note is that some ADR represent more than one stock to get the price point more in range with what is usual for US markets. For example Russian stocks typically are nominated in the cent range, not because they are worth less, they just have more shares for cheaper prices commonly, but for foreign investors it's rather odd to buy stocks for 10 cents or so, and also it's not so nice to break up 10.25 cents per share, so a lot of those ADR just bundle 10, 20 or whatever many shares and expose it as one ADR share.

The downside overall of ADRs are that there might be fees passed on to you (payment to the bank for this service), although lots of ADR are ""sponsored"" so the company pays the fees because it wants the foreign investors, and there are some risks related to the issuer (the bank), plus the usual risks that go along with investing in stocks.",2,1606977549.0

Roth: It’s after tax contributions, but tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals after 59.5 years of age. Some nuances of early distributions and principal only but best save that for another time.

Traditional: It’s pre-tax contributions, but taxed upon withdrawal (capital gains and principal I believe). Another benefit is it lowers your taxable income.

A separate brokerage account is post tax contributions, subject to tax on capital gains at your regular tax bracket, or a long-term capital gains tax (typically 15% unless you make less than 40k or more than ~440k per year) if the stock is held for a year or longer. A benefit to a separate brokerage account is withdrawal whenever you want before retirement age without additional penalties.

High payouts may not be sustainable in the long run if company is currently overpaying.

What would be impt is whether the company's dividend has been growing YoY. And if anything this covid has shown, companies can cut div anytime, which then causes % to go down.

So it's a lot more than just 5 or 6% vs 2 or 3%. Hope it helps.",10,1607077035.0
t3_k6ia78,gelbgbx,"When looking at dividend yield, there are two other metrics you should also be looking at: Payout ratio and dividend growth rate. 

Payout ratio is showing you what % of the company's earnings they are paying out in dividends. The idea being that a lower % is better because it shows that there is more room to grow the dividend plus there is a margin of safety in the event of an economic downturn.

Growth rate shows how much the company is growing the dividend over the past 3, 5, 10 years or whatever time span you choose to look at. If we look at T for example, their 5 year growth rate is 2.06% (currently yielding 7.12%). So even though they have a high yield, its barely growing. When factoring in inflation and the lack of stock price growth, your total return can end up being lackluster.

Example: Let's say you bought $10,000 of T and $10,000 of HD in 2011, and didn't reinvest the dividends but collected them this whole time.

HD (19.71% 10 year div growth rate) would pay $8863.09

T (2.21% 10 year div growth rate) would pay $7227.96

HD currently has a dividend yield of 2.24% vs T at 7.12%. However, HD has done extremely well the last 10 years and due to their massive dividend growth rate, had you bought shares in 2011 of each company you would have collected much more from them. 

Its not an exact science though, there is no rule that says lower % yield stocks outperform higher % yields. You just need to look into why a stock has a high yield in the first place. If investors want dividends, you'd think they'd go for the highest yield, which in turn would drive the stock price up/ So why is T so high and the stock price not moving much? Debt is one factor, the company is loaded down by a ton of debt. Factors like that can influence stock pricing causing some yields to look better on the surface than they really are.

At the end of the day it all stems for why you are investing. I’m 24 and so I am very willing to have riskier “growth” stocks that would appreciate. But my plan is eventually when I’m no longer young to transfer those gains to dividend stocks and get a less risky but consistent return in forms of dividends. 

However, a 55 year old getting ready for retirement might not be seeking the growth and risk a 24 year old would seek. So it definitely relates to where your life is and what you need out of your investments.

But. At the end of the day you are investing to grow your wealth. If I had no idea how to find companies and know which ones to invest in. Getting dividend stocks like PEP, KO, PG JNJ MMM CVX XOM where the yield can average between 2%-6% is a hell of a lot better than whatever interest a bank offers. And all the while you could see some stock appreciation in these blue chip stocks. (Please no comment me about oil rn lol)

You know you don't get to participate in profits beyond your preferred dividends.

Preferred are more secure than commons in the event of bankruptcy, but if a bankruptcy does occur, you're almost certain to get wiped out as well, compared to lower yielding bonds which have are often first to the table when divying up a bankrupt companies estate.

The dividend on a preferred can be suspended. It's that if dividends are paid, preferred holders get their first before common stock holders. There are cummulative preferred, where any missed payments accrue and also need to be repaid before commons receive anything.

My views on preferred and bonds:

Nothing wrong with them except for the fact companies are issuing them to begin with to the public markets. People don't even like it when companies issue additional shares... much less preferred or bonds unless it is in private placement.

If a company is offering debt to the public market, that means something. It's normal enough but nevertheless a signal that their debt might be more valuable than their equity.

Corporate bonds can default. You can make money by investing in corporate bonds, but they can default. 

Look at some REITs. Realty Income doesn't have any public bonds or preferred to my knowledge, while Gladstone Commercial and Monmouth do (they did issue like a billion dollars in notes this year but that is something banks would buy). Some companies don't have to issue them. Others do. There's a worry that investing in the companies that have to offer them already suggests a company struggling for extra money.

Personally this space is much better if you enter it via CEFs like HYT. The capital stack only means something in the event a company is at risk of bankruptcy or other declines. You get paid first or second. In a healthy company you should go for its equity, not its debt instruments. If you go for its debt instruments you might as well admit it isn't a safe company to begin with.

Preferred stock CEFs can also be a nice place to park money. PGX is quite stable. But they select the instruments for you.

Bonds are OTC. Individuals shouldn't be buying them or any OTC products. That is all caveat emptor.",2,1607391660.0

I’m not sure about converting the excess contributions to 2021 contributions. I don’t believe you can do that because the rules are very specific on when you can make contributions for each yeah and we haven’t gotten to the 2021 contribution period yet.

Typically 2019 Roth contributions can only be deposited up until 4/15/2020 HOWEVER this year the tax filing was extended to 7/15/2020 which extends the Roth contribution date for 2019 to 7/15/2020. If you made contributions from July 1-15th 2020 (I’m assuming you maxed for the 2020 year) you can try contacting vanguard and see if they can switch as much as possible to the 2019 contribution year. 

So if you opened the account and made deposits for the 2020 tax year from 7/1-7/15, you MAY be able to convert all of those contributions back to 2019 tax year. Convert as much as possible if allowed because you can then turn around and make additional contributions for 2020 (up until 4/15/2021).

If you aren’t allowed to convert, you can simply withdraw your contributions (not any earnings on the contributions) as an unqualified distribution (no penalties, no tax, etc, it’s your money) and just recontribute that amount starting on 1/1/2021 for the 2021 tax year.",6,1607349889.0

Then two weeks ago I had to stop into a Walgreens store to grab something I'd forgotten to get at Walmart - I jumped into Walgreens because I was driving by one.

Being in that store for about one minute, I thought ""why do I own stock in this company.""  Every time I go to Walgreens, I don't like it.  They're pretty much empty (around me), and a very stale-feeling store.  Employees are never happy, energetic, or otherwise on a positive note.  Just about everything seems over-priced.

Here is a link where you can look up the specific ticker symbol and it will show the dividend history.

Other than that there are 3 important dates. Declaration date, record date, and payout date.

Declaration date is in the name. It is when the company announced the dividend size and payment date

Record date is the date in which you must own the stock in order to receive the dividend 

The payout date is when the dividend gets paid. 

So company X announced on 12/1/2020 that they will pay a dividend on 1/1/2021 of $1 a share and the record date is 12/25/2020.

If I own 1 share as of 12/25/2020 then I will receive $1 on 1/1/2021.

Dividends payout monthly, quarterly, annually, etc. and they can range on payout dates. Not all have to be on 1/1/2021. Some of my quarterly dividends get paid out on 1/10/2021 and some will get paid out on 2/10/2021",12,1607313213.0

t3_k9yi97,gf7gdu4,"You mentioned in another comment that you're looking at about a 35 year investing horizon.  To me, this indicates that you're primarily concerned with long term wealth accumulation.

As others will mention, there really isn't a magic allocation that's regarded as best.  However, in general, younger generations usually gear their portfolios to be more growth oriented and older generations are usually a little more interested in yield.  This is because younger people have very little money and are seeking capital appreciation of their investments to gain lots of money, whereas older people have usually already accrued some money and want to make the money produce stable yet modest returns in the form of dividends.  Older generations also are much more likely to use dividends for their living expenses, especially if they're retired, which is another big reason older people like dividends.

Dividends are absolutely great, as everyone in this sub will agree.  However, you'd be remiss if you completely ignored growth stocks while you're young. 

As for me, I, of course, have a mixed portfolio of income producers and growth stocks.  My average yield on investment (throughout the entirety of my portfolio) is about 6%.  This percentage is fairly large right now due to me taking advantage of the sell off earlier this year and buying depressed dividend stocks and ETFs.",7,1607546878.0
t3_k9yi97,gf8poda,"So to give you an idea I probably have almost 300 stocks on the watch list. I put them all there so I can keep an eye on what the overall market is doing in different sectors I’m interested in. It’s like having an S&P ETF without buying them all while I craft my own custom S&P based ETF. The stocks I actually want to get I can compare to other stocks within the sectors and compare how they are doing in comparison to their competition

I don’t buy a stock because it’s moving on momentum or because it’s in the in crowd. I’m picking up stocks that can demonstrate they have mastery over their competitors, they have the ability to diversify their products and services over time, they consistently see positive gains especially in years such as this. If a good quality stock can score a +0.01¢ EPS or better in a pandemic there’s a pretty good chance they will continue to do well outside a pandemic. Debt is important in business and I like to see debt utilized to expand the company whether that’s buying new products, swallowing other companies, or just plain expanding the reach of their own base. If they’re floundering in debt and it’s being underutilized I wouldn’t want to touch it at all. Other things I’m looking at is how their management structure is put together. Are they well oiled or are they having significant management problems that’s contributing to disasters in products and services. What do they do in the case of problems or recalls. How do they handle getting too big. Is there a company that will exist in 100 years. Essentially I’m looking at the stocks as a business to own not a gamble to spend my next $1. 

A great example is what happened today. The market tanked and went into the red. But the stocks I actually own gave me a positive balance at the end of the day so I beat the S&P for another day again. I learned some time ago to really beat the S&P you actually don’t want to beat the S&P and you’ll find yourself ahead more days than not during times you want it ahead. I don’t mind some underperforming on positive days because often that will translate to smaller losses or positive gains on negative days

A lot of these stocks I hang on to for years so I’m also looking at is the company I’m owning doing well all these years or is there a competition that’s rising above the pack that might be a better play. By now some of the cyclical stocks are seeing gains of a modest amount but the non cyclical stocks are several hundred % over the original basis. 

To answer your original question. The yield percentage and growth benefits balance naturally happen when you seek stocks you’re going into business with rather than seeking stocks for the highest yield. Sure In these market times you could score several times over with an 8% yield but at some point that’s going to stop and if you don’t pull out at the right time you could lose all the gains you had earned at 8% a year and if lucky break even. Now going at 2%-3% year after year after a good 80 years you could have earned 100%+ in passive returns on top of the actual stock growth all because you invested in a company that endures rather than chasing the high flyers for a quick burn",2,1607570819.0

t3_k9x5wy,gf803so,"To answer that  accurately, we would need to know if you are going to continue making contributions into the account or if this is a one-and-done investment. 

If the $3k is part of regular contributions (even if just $50 or $100 a month), then just invest it all right away. You can get the most out of the current bull market. As time goes on  you will be able to see which investment choices are doing well and which ones might be contracting and you can DCA those individual positions with your future contributions. 

If this is your life savings and you have no idea when/if you will be able to begin contributing again, then space out the investments over time so that you can mitigate timing risk. $500 /mo (could further break into $250 twice a month, etc.) going into your investments would be fine. This would provide 6 months of exposure which will take you well past inauguration and the first 90 days.

You should also get voting rights, etc. just like owning common shares.

Since your use of a credit union is primarily for loans to purchase houses - it could be argued that you may be better off using a credit union that doesn't pay a dividend but instead favors lower interest rates for loans.

t3_ka93gn,gfbx9e9,"Hi! We’re the same age and I’m in a similar position, Roth with Vanguard funds (mostly VTSAX), and a few thousand in taxable accounts.

One way I like to frame it is paying taxes every year vs. paying taxes in lump sums when you eventually sell these growth stocks (assuming total non-dividend for this example).

My intention is not to sell these dividend stocks when reaching 45 or 50, but to slowly build a machine that will pay you passively. I find it less risky to evaluate a company’s performance now and invest in it to pay me monthly, quarterly, or yearly for the next X years.

For growth stocks with low or no dividends, it uses the same analysis of “is this a good company to invest in”, but the payoff is delayed. And once the stock is sold, it’s gone. Another nuance is the price of some of these growth stocks and (at least my) current limited ability (low cash) to buy.

There’s a lot more that goes into both, such as industry innovation or compound interest, but I understand dividend stocks and the snowballing effect of compound interest well enough to be confident in it.

One other aside, I use M1 (taxable) to purchase growth stocks (can buy bits and pieces), TD Ameritrade for my HSA and taxable (mostly dividends, some trading) and my roth for good old Vanguard mutual funds. I’m not sure this is the best strategy but it’s what I do.",5,1607641995.0
t3_ka93gn,gfcg5ei,"So long as the dividend companies are also trying to grow, you're likely fine. Age is on your side.

Tax drag is real but considering you're also investing in tax sheltered accounts I don't see a problem with it.

You don't want declining companies (I mean long term declining). 

Personally I choose dividend companies if they're designed to pay out dividends since that's their target. Regular companies can simply elect to halt the dividend altogether and indefinitely. In that case equity growth is nice and preferred. I wouldn't own T because there is little reason that company should be paying out so much since they aren't formally structured to do so. I wouldn't count on dividends to last, personally, before they up and switch and decide to cancel them in favor of redeployment capital.

But well run REITs? Yes, for decades. Others like low growth but likely to last infrastructure stocks like railroads or high margin stuff like tobacco. Not my cup of tea, but there's nothing wrong with a dividend account and the taxes are likely less of a drag than you'd think due to how pass through yields are actually distributed.",4,1607650690.0

Timing the market is often a losing proposition. Your best bet is to DCA (Dollar Cost Average) the stocks, purchase securities you plan to hold for the long term and not think too hard about it. 

My advice for anyone getting started - Treat investing like a bill. Take $5 or $10 a week (or month if that's all you can swing, no judgement) and invest it using a platform that allows fractional shares (I know Robinhood does for sure, not sure about others). If you're just starting and don't want to do the work of research, invest into ETFs - SPY, SPHD, SPCD, QQQ, VYM, VOO, VTI, VGT, VXUS, VWO are all some ETFs to look at. 

An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an organization that takes money and invests into a broad spectrum of stocks and assets. Some of them pay dividends too (SPHD and VYM for example). So by investing into these you're both 1) Diversified, and 2) Having your money actively managed by people who do this professionally (no guarantee they'll be right of course).

t3_kcaum2,gfp7odw,"I think most of us approach dividend investing from a dividend growth perspective. I’ll provide an example of how the risk could pay off in a big way. 

Let’s say I bought QCOM 5 years ago for $47.43. The dividend was .48 a share or a 4% dividend yield. Fast forward today and QCOM is at 144.45 (+176%) and paying a dividend of .65 a share. If you bought today your dividend yield would be 1.7%, however using your cost basis of 47.43 you’re getting a yield of 5.48%. 176% return and 5.48% dividend yield isn’t too shabby and would beat the S&P 500.

So basically what I look for is companies poised for solid growth that also pay increasing dividends hoping to “grow into” a respectable yield.

t3_kcaum2,gfpal9w,"There’s no reason you can’t do both, and hardly anyone really knows where the stock market is going other than mostly up over time.

The simple path to wealth by J.L. Collins is a good read, as the strategy is just putting the majority of your money into an index fund (in his case, VTSAX, or the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index).

His ideology/reasoning is that most people believe they are better than average and can do better than the market (pick individual stocks and get more than 7%) a year. However, 7% a year over 20 years nearly 4x initial investment. And that’s just one lump sum in year 1, not accounting for adding into this portfolio every year.

Another way to look at it is choosing specific companies like Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch, where if you know it’s a wonderful company or you have specific insight, you can absolutely beat the market given the right research and a fair price. You could have went all-in on McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Walmart, or Apple 20 years ago and outperformed the market. The problem is that we don’t know what happens in 20 years, and these choices weren’t so clear in 2000. Other supposedly great companies in 2000 have also gone to zero.

My strategy is to max a Roth IRA with mostly VTSAX and other Vanguard funds as a proverbial boat ticket I can use to board Noah’s Ark when I turn 59.5. In the meantime, I’m building my little dingy of individual stocks/ETFs, which I can choose to take out on the water anytime between now and 59.5.

The thing about dividend investing is you buy at a lower price and wait for both capital appreciation and dividend raises. Im not foing to look up the actual numbers but for example.

Company A is worth 10$ a share and pays a 5% yield.

You buy 10 shares and hold it. They are succesful and raise the dividend payout by 10% per year. So that 50 cent yearly dividend is now 55 cents in year 2. Year 3 60.5 ect ect..

So after 10 years on your 10$ investment you are closer to a 10-12 % yield and that doesnt even include dividend reinvestment.

t3_kc8e7s,gfqi2o2,"Start with any of the Vanguard funds, if you have nothing ETF/mutual fund already. If you have a separate 401k, etc, you can skip this. Basically, the funds don’t run ahead of the market, but they pretty much guarantee you a good return in the long run, like 7-10% a year ballpark (nothing is guaranteed, stock markets are risky, blah blah). It evens out the risk. VYM is decent for growth plus dividend. I have VOO and VYM and FXAIX myself. Index funds are about 3% dividend yields, but great growth. 

Take a small amount of your total net worth to experiment with stocks. I started with $100. Added a bit every 2 weeks to a month. It’s now month 6 and I’m up to $2000 principal, slowly adding more. I’m green and cautiously day trading in amounts around $200 or less. That’s my comfort level. 

T and XOM and MO have high dividend percentages for the current prices. My long term hold choices. Some people swear by O (reits...I personally think there’s some room to fall there, early 2021. But still a good buy if you’ve got the cash now.) Now the ethics of these companies is honestly not the best. “Green” for Exon Mobile is questionable. The HBO-Time Warner deal isn’t very nicely done. And nicotine...well. I mean, I know someone who vapes so it’s not like it’s not a large market. I like NEE but frankly it’s bleeding for me. Dividends okay, electricity is the future though right? 

End of the day, be careful of the taxes - dividends are taxed. Short term holds as income tax, after 60 days as capital gains taxes. If you sell, either type depending on which side of the 1 year mark. If you don’t plan to sell soon, long game, consider a higher growth, lower dividend option - taxes deferred today and all that. Unless you have a low income this year, in which case you should consider day/swing trades for fast returns (if a bit risky sometimes). Swing and say trades got me a 66% ROI (annualized) as of October - lower now cause I doubled my principal and didn’t trade as much in November. I’ve still got a healthy padding, let’s just say.

Your stakes in T and ABBV are too high I think. Make them lower than 7%. If ABBV and T go down 5% in one day, your portfolio will take a huge hit. 

I'd take out Amazon and invest in a tech company that pays a proper dividend. It seems your heavy weight on T and ABBV are making up for it. MSFT and Apple are good alternatives, increase them to 7% too. (MSFT, APPL, and AMZN all follow each other usually day to day). One company I personally recommend is a REIT called Digital Realty.

t3_kf35qh,gg6remo,"Hey, I wanted to echo the previous reply with additional assurance. It seems you’re already aware of the tax benefits of your tax sheltered accounts, such as putting REITs (ordinary income tax) in your HSA. Keep in mind New Jersey and California (rip my HSA) apply state income tax to HSAs, and laws for other accounts may be impacted depending on where you reside.

Depending on your time horizon/allocation percentages, you may want more growth if you’re younger. Some growth companies also offer dividends, albeit low yields such as AAPL and MSFT.

You may want to diversify your holdings from your Roth and taxable DG portfolios, depending on your research (taxes and whatnot, can have same investments in taxable if amount exceeds
max contribution, etc.).

It’s difficult to recommend allocations without more specifics, but even still with specifics (no guarantee of future performance). Luckily, taxable accounts can pivot and rebalance more easily, and tax advantaged accounts may rebalance too.

Good luck and congrats on your diligence!

TL;DR - 

Roth: Taxed in, not taxed out

HSA: No tax in nor out for medical expenses, tax out for non-medical expenses until retirement age

Traditional - Not taxed in, taxed out

Taxable - get wrecked, but lower taxes for ling term capital gains, differing by tax bracket, flexibility before retirement",5,1608243635.0
t3_kf35qh,gg644n3,"Currently, the maximum tax rate for qualified dividends is **20%**, **15%**, or **0%**, *depending on your taxable income and tax filing status.* You can answer you own question by doing a sample tax return once you get the numbers input properly.

I strongly suggest you quit listening to broad statements about where to place YOUR assets.

You need to develop an investment plan that it tailored to your goals and while it is prudent to usually max out your tax sheltered accounts we really have no way of knowing what is best for you since we do not have enough information to make an informed decision.",2,1608232161.0

t3_ket902,gg4hnwz,"Historical data shows that total earnings would be higher with the 100k in the S&P even over DRIPping your dividends (this assumes DRIP back into dividend stocks), but history is just that, history. There is also reason the think that the S&P is rather inflated currently, although that has always been preached as being the case. S&P growth has outpaced typical dividend yields for a long time now (with risk adjusted returns considered, ie not going all in on a 10% dividend stock), there is still a good chance that going straight into the S&P would be the better option, assuming you believe the historical data will repeat itself (again, no guarantees ever).

Regardless, it’s  an impossible question to answer by virtue of the unknown nature of the future of each individual dividend stock and of the S&P 500 as a whole. Diversity is on the side of the S&P though if you are looking to beat its returns with dividend stocks which leaves a very limited number of stocks to consider which have high enough yields/growth combos.

Is there a reason you’re looking at S&P 500 and not US all-cap ETFs, which have seen similar growth but with far more diversity?

I’ll probably get downvoted for saying something against dividends but its simply fact backed up by historical data.

Edit: all reinvesting dividends into the S&P will do is either mean that initial div investment is making less money (if the S&P is outpacing the dividends) than if it were in the S&P, or vice versa if the reverse is true and dividends perform better in the future. I suppose it could work as some sort of hedge but wouldn’t be more efficient than one or the other. Stocks already compound each year as gains are calculated on a yearly basis so are ever compounding when we speak of returns, they simply aren’t realized, in the same was as using a DRIP with div stocks. That said, if you do go with the div option, I would highly recommend DRIPping unless you find yourself needing the income. Having the liquid cash available in an account is never a good idea for long term efficient investing, the faster and longer funds are in the market, the better.

Edit 2: don’t take anything I say as gospel, do the research yourself from sources which know much much more than I do. I’m simply regurgitating that info, possibly with unintentional bias and misremembering things. There are some good portfolio managers on YouTube who discuss this. Ben Felix in Canada is great, not sure of an American equivalent. I do know for a fact though that historical data is in the favour of the S&P, which also allows you to choose to attempt to sell high instead of receiving dividends when markets are low, essentially selling low without the choice to do otherwise (stocks dip the same value as the div payout).",79,1608194028.0

t3_ket902,gg4vmq1,"This is why I make the argument that 5% dividend portfolios are not really ideal. They tend to not beat the S&P500 long term,  historically speaking. The argument I have though is that if you invest in good companies that have a solid investment and plan, you can still get that 5% per year.  Dividend Portfolios are more predictable than the S&P500. This is why retirees like them so much. If they have a million in their 401k at 55, they can live off the 5% in dividends per year. 

8% growth on S&P500 is not guaranteed. Same with Companies paying out dividends. I like to tell people to think of getting paid out 5-6% a year though, as that will keep your mentality a bit more sane. If you try to top the S&P500, I believe you already don't have the right mindset long term.",10,1608207859.0

Accumulate Spy (or whatever your favored ETF is) and also accumulate your dividend payers, whether they’re companies or other ETFs.

That said having $100,000 invested at age 25 and letting it compound at 8% average for 40 years will net you over 2 million by retirement. 

Keep in mind that 2 million in 2060 dollars will probably have significantly less purchasing power. And while some to many would be able to retire on that sum today, considering that you’ve already banked $100k, that indicates your a higher than average earner, and so you’ll need a proportionately bigger nest egg.

While the Smart Transfers is a nice start, I was kinda disappointed with the options available to it.

* owns a globally diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets backed by long-term, fixed-rate contracts that supply it with predictable income. The company currently gets 69% of its cash flow from renewable energy assets, 15% from electricity transmission and transportation networks, 13% from efficient natural gas power plants, and 3% from water desalination facilities. The company uses the bulk of its stable income to pay a 4.8%-yielding dividend. It allocates the rest to help finance new investments. Atlantica targets to invest $200 million to $300 million per year to expand its portfolio, which should enable it to steadily increase its high-yielding dividend.

Non dividend generating: Clean energy fuels corps (CLNE)

* Clean Energy is still a renewable stock by virtue of its hottest product: Redeem, a biofuel that's made from renewable natural gas. To make Redeem, Clean Energy collects methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- from sources like farms, dairies, and landfills and processes it into usable fuel. When the methane is burned, it's turned into carbon dioxide, a much less potent greenhouse gas. So, using Redeem actually helps mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
Redeem has supercharged Clean Energy's operations. According to CEO Andrew Littlefair on the most recent third-quarter earnings call, Redeem has grown to more than 60% of Clean Energy's overall fuel mix. Littlefair has set a goal of transitioning the company's fueling infrastructure entirely to Redeem by 2025.
Clean Energy's stock has risen more than 90% so far this year, but its current share price of about $4.50/share is nowhere near its all-time high of about $24/share. Its current price-to-book ratio of about 1.6 is higher than it was in all of 2019, but near the low end of the company's historical range of 0.4-5.2.

The div payout is not only high because of the price decline, but because it is a REIT.  It has to pay a certain percentage.

I jumped in on this one earlier this summer, have listed to both earnings calls since purchasing, and feel management knows what they are doing as they’ve dealt with these situations for literally decades.

They are also diversifying into rehabilitation, halfway houses, and tracking/monitoring.

I prefer private industry to government run operations.

t3_kgft5m,ggee7h8,"Personally it’s a bad deal. One the dividend payout is ridiculously high and that’s the result of a declining stock. The stock price is where it was right around 2006 and other than the period between 2006 and now the stock has never been that high 

Looking at the political situation between covid and sentiment about prisons the US has significantly shifted their perceptions about keeping people locked up. California in particular has shed a good chunk of 50k inmates over the past 10 years with half of it coming due to covid. California also recalled all of their out of state inmates that were in private prisons

The public itself at this point has shifted to rehabilitation over continued incarceration. While Biden initially signed the bill increasing incarceration he tends to go with the flow of popular opinion so he likely will increase releases. If not through another law then through pardons and commutations. If he can’t shutter a private prison he can reduce how many people go there. He might even have the ability to change the contract language the next time the contracts are up for renewal 

Assuming the dividend doesn’t go down you might get lucky to hit $36k assuming the stock goes up to $13 

A few things you are doing though is painting a very rosy picture. When you look at their earnings they’re on a bit of a decline. They actually saw a decline between 2019 and 2020 and this is a 24/7 facility that can’t be impacted by the pandemic 

One thing recently to be mindful of is the feds under the current President is already not renewing contracts: The GEO Group, Inc. (NYSE: GEO) (""GEO"") announced today that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has decided to not rebid the contract for the company-owned, 1,450-bed Rivers Correctional Facility in North Carolina, which is set to expire on March 31, 2021. The contract for the Rivers Correctional Facility generated approximately $43 million in annualized revenues for GEO. GEO expects to market the Rivers Correctional Facility to other federal and state agencies

They’re expecting a lower EPS going into the next quarter. As a result of that and other factors their dividends are declining as well. The height of their dividend was back in 2016. Since then it’s been on a marked decline with significant cuts to dividend price

While they might be turning a profit today I don’t expect that to be the case always unless they can convert their facilities to move toward inmate rehabilitation instead of inmate incarceration. They say they are the premier rehab facility and if that were true the stock should be booming but it’s not. So until they make changes I would be avoiding this especially with the really high volatility that comes along with it aka one day you might hit $13 a share and the next it could drop down to $8 or lower

In 2021, it will be reimplemented by Joe Biden. So for the next four years, the industry will be forced into contraction.

Expect the industry to be used as a negotiating pawn for the next four to eight years. Potentially up to 12-16 if Kamala Harris wins.

* MRK
* PEP (48-year Aristocrat)

t3_kfzb5p,ggbw8k4,"Here is my advice that has worked wonders for me

Portfolio is from 50k to 363k as of right now. 

I started investing at 21 with exactly 50k.. 12 years in now

My goal was to preserve capital.. And grow that account as I was doing my finance degrees

I picked 10 stocks that I liked. All with dividend

2 stocks in each sector

Reit
Healthcare
Energy
Consumer
Technology 

I never bought any shares outright. I always sold cash secured puts. 

Once assigned.. I did covered Strangles non stop.. Meaning added a cash secured put underneath and sold a covered call on top of it.. Instead of 30 to 45 days out I purposely went 60 days out to collect more premium and allowed me to go further on the strikes and have larger profit margins

I paid attention to dividend dates to decide the dates for my expirations

1. Only stuck to companies I knew and wanted to own long term.

2. Made sure stocks had high liquidity and high institution ownership. Gives me a floor and mental peace of mind

3. Never panic sold. Used options.. Simple covered calls and cash secured puts over and over and over on the same under lying

4. Kept 30% of my money originally in cash cuz i knew I was clueless but after 3 years I was 100% invested in this non margin account

5. Over the years changed the companies and rotated in companies with higher Implied volatility 

I know i left a lot on the table in that account as my growth portfolio is significantly bigger and better returns over the last 12 years now

But that account was my high school money.. That I made selling anything and everything. Working 12$ an hour  jobs 7 days a week after school and weekends.. Teaching act math for 20 bucks an hour.. Fixing computers for 50$ an hour.. 

Obviously it helps that we been in the most ridiculous bull market since 2009 when I fully started during third year of finance degree 

But they don't teach you jack sh.t in school or college

As the companies I traded grew.. So did my account..

Also around February when covid started.. I closed all my positions.. Booked a 26k loss on paper.. Was thinking real estate will crash and use the money to buy another rental asset or two

Well real estate never crashed..  So in may was back in doing the same thing over and over .. I obviously use many more strategies now but that account.. I stick to what been working. Covered strangles.. Almost every 45 days I get to collect 6 to 8 % without factoring in dividends

And if the shares get called away.. It is usually 15 to 18% or higher if there is a catalyst like earnings which I used to be scared off but now I just love as the implied volatility goes up and my returns are better

Hope this helps young jedi..

It isn't hands off.. But it's much much easier than it sounds.",27,1608352114.0
t3_kfzb5p,ggc4xf6,"The thing for me has always been: WHY would a stock go up over time. What's the catalyst? Is the company model good? Is their cash flow good? Is it well known? How essential is it to the industry? What is the catalyst to recovery? Is it just a lot of debt? Lack of growth prospects? ETC. How well do you really know the company?

EX: Look at the speculation analysis ones. CVS is well positioned but treats its employees questionably. LRCX has a lot of competitors but all semiconductors are growing. HAS? payout ratio is very high. The moat and legacy is what draws me (id argue nearly as much brand loyalty as AAPL, MSFT, or DIS. HPQ? Lots of debt but seems to be taking advantage of covid. Keep going down your portfolio and ask yourself why are you in this company. It shouldnt be because of fear or a random person's recommendation.

Investing in any of those ETFs will net you consistent long term gains. If ETFs satisfy your goals, just stick with them and contribute a set dollar amount monthly for buying more. They're a nice, easy (mostly) hands-off approach.

Now if you aren't satisfied with just ETFs, start looking into individual companies after building a up foundation for your portfolio with a few quality ETFs.

t3_kfzb5p,ggcavgs,"You need a mindset shift. I'd recommend Annie Duke's ""Thinking in Bets"". 

The TL;DR - Too many people think of life like chess where we have all the information to make decisions. Instead, life is like poker - we can't know all the information but must act anyway. Everything we do in life is a bet and just because the result is good or bad does not mean we made a bad bet. Even in a 90% chance of success - you'll sometimes see the 10% loss. 

The book offers a ton of strategic and tactical level mindset exercises that'll help you wrap your head around it. I think you'll find it super beneficial.

Main thing is your investments shouldn’t stress you out. If you already work 60+ hours make investing simple and let your money work for you. 

Another tip that isn’t mentioned much or at all here is put this money into a tax shelter like a Roth account and HSA. I’d advise maxing both out every year if you can. $6,000 a year I would just dollar cost average $500 a month into a ROTH if you can. I would also advise a HSA if you qualify.

Or, putting it another way, If you put money into something on a conviction, what does anyone elses stock valuations matter? Pretty sure TSLA was valuated as a 100$ overvalued stock for multiple years now. Only once they picked up steam did they skyrocket to S&P status.

They won't lose to Amazon.. in fact they had talks mid-pandemic with Amazon about turning some JC Penney's into Amazon fulfillment centers. Plans just fell through. Again, think about location, and the merger deal with Taubman Centers is only expanding that.

t3_kgjw00,ggfmscr,"Seems like you have two questions. How should you setup your core, and what should the ratio of core/satellite be.

The first one is simple. No one knows the future and no one can tell you certainly that VTI would be better than your mix of VUG, VTV, VV, VO, and VB. VTI is simple and you’ll never be excited about outperformance or upset at underperformance. It’s just gonna go. If you make your own selection of core investments via the other funds you are choosing your exposure to areas of the market. You may be right or wrong. Probably never too wrong with those funds. If you like the idea of betting on small caps(or mid caps, growth, whatever) versus the general market, buy the smallcap fund. If you have no thoughts buy VTI.

As for how much you should have in core versus satellite, it depends on your goal. At 3% in 11 stocks and the rest in VTI you would rarely deviate significantly from VTI returns. If that’s what you want, great. If the goal of picking the satellite positions is to have an effect on your overall returns you need closer to 5%+ concentration in a stock to start “undiversifying” your portfolio so you feel the results of your bets. You could do that with 1 stock at 5% and 95% in VTI or 25% split between 5 stocks and 75% in VTI. Depends on how many bets you want to make.

Given that they also don't provide any meaningful capital appreciation (they're actually down almost 15% over the past 5 years) its a pure dividend play and the dividend is on the cusp of losing to inflation.

It’s not as difficult as people make it out to be. However, it can be a huge burden if you start investing in tons of them. So I would advise avoiding several of them.

As others have said, TurboTax and similar software can easily handle these forms. You might need to do a bit of reading on handling your first one though, but it’s not bad.

They’re not called dividends when it’s an MLP, they’re called distributions. This is because you don’t pay tax on those payouts-right now. They return capital to you. For example: you buy $2,000 worth of an MLP stock and get $100 back in distributions that year. Your cost basis is now $1,900. So if you sell it later for $2,500, your capital gain will be $600. This can actually be advantageous for many people because if you hold it for longer than a year you will get long term capital gain rates.

There are several other issues that can come in to play, but this is the basic gist of it.",29,1608647327.0

t3_kilt2r,ggtqeqc,"I am invested in T, and while I am bullish on them I do have concerns about their management. I do love that they are looking to unload Dish, just write that off as a huge loss because that industry is dying and 15 billion plus getting rid of the debt associated is a fairly decent return considering the context of the situation they find themselves in. That 15 billion in cash can help them invest in their 5G network and HBO Max while at the same time lowering their debt load 13.8 billion by unloading Dish's debt. 

I am also concerned about T's 5G capabilities and the increased competition from T-Mobile along with the management's rumored unloading of entertainment assets which I think is a huge mistake. Overall I think their dividend is covered short term in the next 5-7 years which is good but longer term there could be larger squeezes on that dividend that could result in cuts which will tank the principle. 

However I do like HBO Max's long term potential after a shaky start, T has stable revenue streams from cell service and internet service along with their media assets which should stabilize long term. I also like how they have shrunk their debt 15% since their highest point and how if free cash flow can sustain its self they should be able to both pay down debt and maintain the dividend. 

What concerns me is that they might not have the cash to both service their dividend, pay down their debt and invest in their business interests on the media and 5G side.

The way margin works, if the value of your investments falls too far, you're forced to either 1) deposit more cash into your accounts to cover the losses, or else 2) your broker will force you sell some of your assets.

There were a lot of great buying opportunities back then, but if you had a highly leveraged account using a lot of margin you might have been forced to sell at a horrible price, and been unable to take advantage of all of the great deals available.

My personal investment strategy is to contribute to my 401k at company match, then max out Roth, then contribute to a normal brokerage account. Reason being that I don't want to work until I'm 70 either, and since you can't withdraw from retirement accounts early (without penalty) I want another source of income, hence the brokerage account.",4,1608775509.0
t3_kj5t1b,ggv4pxg,"Step 1: Considering that Robinhood is discontinuing support for REITs like O, I would suggest leaving the platform, as your investment research may take you further into REITS.  It is my firm belief  that your choice of brokerage should empower your investments, not serve as a hinderance.  Even if O remains the only REIT in your portfolio, the company is such a powerful investment that I would jump ship simply to keep it in your portfolio.  Whether you can transfer your account or not is dependent on what the brokerages say.  Some have restrictions.  If you have to sell a few securities for a loss, you can still use it as a tax write-off, so even in death, every investment has value.

Step 2: Check your 401k.  Read the fine print.  More and more 401k plans are allowing the usage of 3rd party brokerages.  If so, check to see which ones are allowed.  Never go with the default option, since most of those still charge commissions.  Get yourself either an M1, Schwab, Fidelity, etc. account with commission free trading and sync it to your 401k plan if you can.  Simply having all your investments with one brokerage is incredibly powerful, and will simplify your tax paperwork.  

Step 3: Whether you even want a 401k is dependent on your timeframe.  Are you a tech programmer making 250k per year planning to invest 200k over ten years and retire at 35 with $2million in the bank?  If so, a retirement account is not for you, since you can't pull from a retirement account until you reach a certain age.  

For most investors with an average income, I recommend the hybrid approach.  Build both a taxable account and a retirement account together.  Let your dividends compound so that by the time you enter your fifties or early sixties, you would be free to transition away from full time work if necessary (you don't know how your body will age) before the minimum withdrawal age.  You may still need to work part time, but it would allow you greater flexibility to pursue less physically demanding work should that be your current career path.  It also allows you to call it quits early if you end up having incredible luck in the market and wish to cash out of the workforce.",3,1608779733.0

I started investing at 23 and now have what I think is a good sized portfolio for my age. Since the OP ask is about dividends, I will discuss that.

Before I do, I want to mention that I consider dividends as a factor when I invest, but I do not chase yield. I do have some REITs but, again not invested solely for their yield.

I suffered one dividend cut and one dividend suspended in 2020. The dividend cut was from a mortgage REIT, and the suspension was from Disney.

I am about three years in and without including 401k (regular brokerage, traditional, and ROTH IRA), I will finish the year with an estimated forecast of just under $1,400 dividends for 2021 with no new investments. It should be about 1,380 or something.

I have a goal for the end of 2025 to forecast for 3k in dividends for 2026. Then a larger goal of mine is for 6k at the end of 2030, forecasted for 2031.

The 6k goal is a large one of mine as I think that is when the snowballing really hits. My thought being that 6k is the amount that one could put into an IRA (pending other scenarios).

There is a lot of money to be made on growth stocks, and I do hold some growth stocks and have made a decent amount this year selling some off (APHA, BRK-B, few SPACs), but at the end of the day I like predictable cashflow. I have about 85% or so of my portfolio into dividend paying stocks.

Whilst my portfolio is quite big, it's not exactly established. I invested heavily for divs in the March crash and throughout the year. I've been chasing mostly high dividend yielding stocks, which in normal times is a big warning sign, but these are not normal times.

I managed to pick up banks, oil & gas, REITs, utility companies and much more at big discounts.

Fortunately I had access to a decent amount of capital during this market volatility because I was saving (for years) for a real estate development project, which I bought the land for this year, but still short perhaps $500k for development. All of my term deposits were maturing and the interest rates had now become pathetic, so everything aligned quite well.  I run my own small business which has allowed me to generate decent income over the years.

Currently about 40% of my portfolio is paying the same dividends as pre-covid, 20% have reduced dividends, 23% have suspended the dividend all together.

I think I am earning about 6% yield at the moment, or about $5k a month, but I expect as everything recovers around the world this yield could be 8-9% or higher and capital growth could be 50%-70%.

My investment allocation for 2021 is going to be 50% split between growth stocks/funds and 50% to dedicated to dividend stocks that will have the dividends re invested for the time being. When I have enough to buy a house in cash with stocks I've held for a year or longer I'll do that and then switch to 75% dividends and 25% growth. There are a few positions I wouldn't sell to buy a house which are my current or future dividend plays along with a few positions that will either grow significantly over the next few years or go to zero. I have high hopes that a couple of them will begin offering dividends after significant growth over the next 18-24 months and 36-48 months respectively.

I also have some money invested in dedicated retirement accounts but I like to pretend that money doesn't exist because I don't plan on touching it any time soon.",6,1608883581.0

I am currently 20 years old with about $3000 invested, with another $1500 transfering. I mainly use robinhood as I started with it two years ago and I honestly like the UI and design cause I do all my research and analysis off app.

I have just recently sold off a lot and completely restructured after starting to take my investing seriously, like within the last month so a lot is still working but I am currently set to be making about $95 a year in dividends and I would like to get that up to $1200 a year by the end of next year. 

I am right now playing rather safe with 64% of my holdings in ETFs and the other 36% in stocks which I will break down below. I've chosen to take a more passive approach as I like the passive income that it brings and I'm not looking for the next 2x stock or the next Tesla, though I will say that if you have any stock suggestions I would love for you to put them in the comments and I will definitely do research on the companies!

So my current portfolio consists of this:

ETFs: | $VOO 1.22% | $VTI 13% | $VXUS 9.96% | $VEU 9.66% | $SCHD 2.14% | $SPHD 27.51% |

Stocks: | $O 8.16% | $AAPL 8.86% | $KO 14.36% | $JNJ 5.11%| 

I am also currently looking at $XOM, $EPD, $BYND, $BLK, $NNDM to expand into, some for diversification into different fields and some for the growth factor.

Let me know what you think, any resources you would recommend I read, any stocks i look into, etc. and thank you for looking!",5,1608864805.0
t3_kjqa5x,ggyxosd,"I'm 29 and started investing for dividends in September of 2019. I make about $20k a year net at my job and thanks to years of strict budgeting and living with my partner, I'm able to live off of about $12k of that money.  This first year has been a lot of learning, I dumped multiple stocks and bought new ones as I learned how dividends work and how they're taxed. I now however have a 10 stock portfolio that I add between $400-600 to monthly, consisting of one dividend focused S&P ETF, 8 very safe, very boring individual stocks, and one very very small position in one growth stock.   


I ended 2019 with about $23 in dividends, and $3000 in the market. I am ending 2020 with $14,400 in the market, having earned $416 in dividends across this year, with a baseline of about $700 in dividends to start my growth next year, just from the investing I have done before the end of 2020, not counting the year of investing I have in front of me.",5,1608878276.0

This year i will make about 600 in dividend.  Currently my portfolio has a yield on cost of about 1.8% but a projected dividend growth rate of 14% (not including the cash i will be adding). 

In 2019 i got 20% rate of return. This year i am on track to achieve 25% return. 

My advice is to be patient, keep adding and buy when cheap or the best priced available. Keep cash on hand.

t3_kjqa5x,gh04esj,"I'm 35, I started investing in the middle of 2019, after years of avoiding stocks altogether and just going for bonds/CDs. One of the things that pushed me into switching to dividend stocks was seeing the writing on the wall about lowering interest rates, and how negative rates seemed inevitable. No way was I paying people to borrow my money.

My first stock purchase wasn't a dividend stock, it was TSLA, since I saw how obsessed everyone was about my co-workers brand new Model 3, and knew they would do well after I looked heavily into them. After that though I did a lot of reading up on investing, and decided to become a dividend investor. 

I'm in a very good financial situation, so I've been able to funnel a lot of money into my dividend portfolio. As my CDs and bonds mature I'm moving most of their money into dividend stocks as well, and a lot of them have been getting called early due to the lower interest rates. Hence I've been able to invest nearly $200,000 into dividend stocks in the last 18 months. My portfolio of dividend stocks currently looks like this:

* AAPL - 1.19%

* ALB - 4.04%

* DIS - 4.69% (bought into this before they cut the dividend, I still think they'll eventually start paying dividends again once COVID passes)

* DUK - 6.06%

* HON - 4.72%

* IBM - 1.40% (One of the only 3 losers in my portfolio)

* JNJ - 15.79%

* JPM - 17.38%

* MCD - 7.61%

* MSFT - 4.41%

* MMM - 10.61%

* PEP - 8.62%

* SO - 2.69%

* T - 3.88% (I made the mistake of buying into this in the high 30's initially, but have DCA down on it in the $20's)

* VZ - 5.83%

* WFC - 1.07% (My single worst investment decision, bought in literally right before COVID when it tanked hard, but it's my smallest position at least)

I'm planning on focusing more heavily on dividend growth stocks in 2021.",3,1608919237.0
t3_kjqa5x,gh148qy,"Started investing in April, currently making $3,400/year in dividends. Hindsight I should have lump sum invested everything I had from the start.

If I were fully invested right now I would be making over 8-10k/year based on my current yield of 6.29%. Im Still DCAing everyday. I could have gotten better results knowing what I know now, but I cant complain im pretty happy with the performance so far. Just glad I finally started investing at 30years old. Having over 160k cash sitting in GICs and HISA was getting abit ridiculous with these rates..

My best purchase was buying almost 3k worth of BMO in April, manage to lock-in a 6.42% yield on that one and im up +48% on that position! Ive done other good buying but did alot of premature selling.

The only person who can answer this is you. We can go through good or bad stocks all day but if you don't know what you're investing in, you're going to get burned eventually. It also depends on what you want for your future. Are you just looking to have a safety net? Are you looking for retiring early? Crossing the million stage?

Ok, but you really need a more comprehensive investment policy statement (IPS).

Some good info on starting out is here:

[https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/invest/investing-basics/making-a-plan/create-your-investment-plan/](https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/invest/investing-basics/making-a-plan/create-your-investment-plan/)

Highlights are:

A proper IPS will:

* specify your investment goals and objectives,
* describe the strategies that will help you meet your objectives,
* describe your return expectations and time horizon,
* include detailed information about how much risk you’re willing to take,
* include guidelines on the types of investments that make up your portfolio, and how accessible your money needs to be, and
* specify how your portfolio will be monitored, and when or why it should be rebalanced.

So I suggest before you go about picking stocks, you spend time developing a plan, you are about 5 steps ahead of yourself right now and that could lead to a lot of mistakes.",3,1609030630.0

-> The Brazilian stock market is the B3 previously known as BOVESPA. You will probably find the ticker as “BVMF” (BVMF: <stock ticker>)

2)ENERGIAS DO BRASIL (BVMF: ENBR3)
3)NEOENERGIA (BVMF: NEOE3) 

Those three companies are energy ones, they work either with producing or distributing energy. In Brazil it’s a solid, stable and growing sector, besides being a good dividend payer. 

4)ITAÚSA (BVMF: ITSA4) 
This is a Holding that have one of the biggest banks in it’s portfolio (the Itaú bank). It is also a good dividend payer, due to it’s discounted price in comparison to the companies it holds.

5) BRADESPAR (BVMF: BRAP4)
This is also a holding with a discounted price in relation to the portfolio main company - that being Vale do Rio Doce (BVMF: VALE3), the bigger mineral extraction (mainly iron) company in Brazil. It is also a growing company. 

6) BANCO DO BRASIL SEGURIDADE (BVMF: BBSE3)
This one is actually a insurance company but with great ROE and also a big contract secured with another one of Brazil’s big banks (the Banco do Brasil).

AVGO:
Broadcom is a diversified tech monster with fingers in many buzzword pies such as 5G.

Home Depot has massive dividend growth, and is a store that has staying power. Share price growth has been sweet as well.

T Rowe Price is a financial giant that has an impressive div growth track record and no signs of slowing down.

Texas Instruments is way more than just calculators. They make circuit components that are probably in most electronic devices you use. Not only is their div growth track record incredible, but the share appreciation has been excellent as well for me.

It takes a few thousand bricks to build a house. You just put down one of the first bricks. Those first bricks are key, as they support the rest of the house.

Most people don't even put down any bricks, so you are ahead of the game, in my humble view.

As to the snowball effect, I would just be incredibly patient. Keep doing what you are doing; don't stop. And don't obsess over monthly and yearly statements. Just keep going forward.

I'm an old guy (late 50's). I didn't really perceive or focus on the proverbial snowball effect until I was in my late 40's. Obviously, I'm not a brilliant investor, and I've always been focused on index funds vice individual stocks. Also at this point in my life, I'm focused on the extent to which passive returns can cover more and more of our annual budget. So it also matters what one means by ""snowball effect."" At this point in my life, ""snowball effect"" means balancing each additional year in the workforce versus living off of passive investments. I'm waiting for passive returns to replace my income, and that's hard to do with index funds. We're giving it a go, however.

My account today generates $300 a month in dividends but the most amazing thing I notice is that every 3 months, the dividends get bigger and bigger. This is because I automatically reinvest them each month. The more I see them grow, the more motivated I get to invest more money to grow my income. It’s a virtuous cycle. 

Another game changer that I found is that when the market drops, I could see my dividends purchasing more shares each month which made me super happy. Previously during a market crash, I’d have panicked and sold but by focussing on income - I just continued to accumulate.

Technically speaking, any amount of dividend that you are reinvesting (even if you're saving up top buy a share) is the beginning of the snowball effect. So you're $1, assuming you don't take it out, is the snowball effect.

But more realistically, **once your monthly dividends allow you to buy another share**, that's the beginning of the more reasonable snowball effect. Assuming you buy a stock that pays monthly, that's when you will see you're monthly dividends increase month over month.

t3_kn4hxc,ghke3du,"Congrats on achieving your first milestone! Creating a plan, establishing milestones, and executing to the plan is really important!

Just as important is having the right plan. I don’t know your situation, but presumably you’re reinvesting dividends and don’t need the dividend for current income. 

With that in mind, you may be better off investing in relative safe growth companies, or even an S&P 500 index fund. The nice thing about an S&P 500 index fund is that you can achieve both growth and dividend income with a single low risk fund. 

I’m in my early 40s and still have most my portfolio in growth funds/stocks, but as I’ve realized gains there, I’ve placed them into safer investments that provide a dividend. 

The growth oriented investments have greatly outperformed the value oriented investments, and I’m young enough to tolerate the near term risk, so it has been working well for me. Your mileage/tolerance may vary. :)

It’s going to take awhile to snowball. For me, it didn’t really snowball until I got really serious about paying myself first, and finding opportunities to kick in something extra above my plan on a somewhat regular basis. 

Even small extra contributions really start to add up, and at some point the reinvested dividends stop buying you a fraction of a share and start buying multiple shares.

t3_kn4hxc,ghkforx,"Dude compounding interest is math. It works when you get a continuous percentage return on a growing investment. So if you get 10 percent on 100 you now have 110. If you make 10 percent on the 110 you make 11 and not you have 121. So on and so forth. Your return increases as the value of your investment increases. The snowball rolls as you realize gains, reinvest them and make more percentage return. In theory some kind of account like a CD could pay 6 percent annually and compound over time. That shit isn't around anymore though. Reinvesting the dividend payment from one stock won't get you any more returns until you get another share.

t3_knfodn,ghkwuzc,"Look for a dividend yeald to match your age if yo are 20 get 2% dividend stocks  age 30 buy 3% 40 buy 4% 50 buy 5 % to 6% that way you will vet growth and a growing dividend that should be 5% to 7% when you retire  if you won't to retire early go with the above but add 10 years on to your age now .

Don't miss out on Walgreens stock thats 1/2 price with a nice dividend and will soon move up 

Only buy on red days if the stocks on a green day skip it and come back on your next buying day 

Keep 20% of your portfolio in cash so if any drop big time you can buy more at a big drop price

t3_knfodn,ghk7wul,"The key to survivable dividends is to look for aristocrats with long term payment histories ie: ones that haven’t missed a payment for 5+ years, and aim for higher yields then 3.11%, anything under 5% isn’t worth the trouble as you’d have to invest $500,000 just to get $2000 monthly. I try to compensate not holding anything  under 5% with a few riskier ones above 10%. And watch for stability and growth. A stable high yield is better then a low yield grower with minimal growth.
