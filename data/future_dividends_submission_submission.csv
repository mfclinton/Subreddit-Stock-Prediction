For example, equity A and B meet the criteria above and you don't care about short term losses post-dividend payment date because you will hold both companies for the next 10-20 years. Assuming you can cover transactions fees, can this be profitable?

This time, I did the same thing but using a lot of the popular monthly dividend paying stocks. The objective is to create a model portfolio that generates **$1,000 per month** in dividend income using the least amount of capital.

I decided to use this article (which I found on Google) to help me model a portfolio stocks that I picked from here (all arbitrary picks, no real DD behind them): [https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T044-S001-16-high-yield-monthly-dividend-stocks-to-buy/index.html](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T044-S001-16-high-yield-monthly-dividend-stocks-to-buy/index.html)

I also added a few other monthly dividend stocks I found here and there through internet searches. In the end, I found 20 stocks that I wanted to work with. 20 being an arbitrary number but I think is a good number for diversification purposes.

1. AGNC Investment Corp (AGNC)
2. Capitala Finance Corp (CPTA)
3. EPR Properties (EPR)
4. Gladstone Investment Corporation (GAIN)
5. Gladtone Capital Corporation (GLAD)

7. Harvest Capital Credit Corp (HCAP)

17. Shaw Communications Inc (SJR)
18. Stag Industrial Inc (STAG)
19. Vermillion Energy Inc (VET)
20. Whitestone REIT (WSR)

I ran Excel Solver on my spreadsheet table, with a few constraints, to determine how many of each of these shares I should purchase to earn $1,000 per month.

One constraint was ""no stock can be more than 7% of the portfolio"". Again, another arbitrary number, but a number I felt comfortable with so that there isn't one stock that overweighs completely over the rest.

The results were as follows:

Many of the shares are in fractional amounts but we can use our own discretion as to whether we want to round up or down.

I noticed that Solver said to allocate the least amount of capital to OHI, probably because it has a lower monthly dividend yield than the rest.

I also didn't realize that GAIN and GLAD are probably the same company so there's some overlap in risks.

I am totally on board with growing this sub, so I’m gonna ask this here instead of in another investing sub. Thanks everyone for trying to keep the dividend dream alive.

I’ve been trying to figure out why people use RobinHood or M1? I’ve never checked them out and honestly don’t know what they do. However, a friend at work asked me what I use, and when i said Merrill Lynch he laughed and said “well i get free trades.” 

Is that why people use it? Or are there other benefits? I ask because I opened my scottrade account in 2012 and have executed a trade every other week (payday) ever since and have never paid a fee. I also drip monthly dividends, so have an additional 6-10ish automatic free trades a month. I moved to Merrill when Scottrade was bought by TDAmeritrade cuz it looked cool to have everything in my BOA account. They don’t even make me ask anymore, free trades in perpetuity.

Anyways, I started at Scottrade with $250. When I wanted to execute a trade, I called them and asked for a few free trades to help me get started and they always said yes. I did this for years. If you just tell the truth, the truth being that if they don’t give you free trades you will move to another broker, they will probably say yes.

In my dividend porfolio,  CSCO is at 80% of Unrealized Gain.  VFC at 75% Unrealized Gain.

My questions is should I trim both atleast 50%?  sell half of both ? 

I was listening to Cramer on podcast (his money show on cnbc at 6 pm EST - Fast Money), I like to listen to it since its without commercial and great for when you are driving. He said you should at least trim your position after you are up by 50-70%.  I know for sure  market crash is coming in end of 2019 and 2020.  

I was thinking shoulder I trim some of my dividend position & buy utilities ETF (vanguard, $SO, etc) And Buy more (of whatever I sell in next month of two) when market is down.

I am thinking... if i sell CSCO & VFC Now, I will buy later in 2020 when market corrects/crashes. 

what you guys think is the best strategy of stock holdings once you are up by more than 50% of original value? 

please comment, advice.

t3_bdmdvj,Options Dividend Capture Strategy,"Hello all, Just joined the group as I have started making some divi options trades and wanted to know if anyone else is doing the same.

There are a couple of variations:

1) Buy the stock (right?) before ex-date and then sell an ATM or ITM covered call right afterward.  Profit from the divi plus the CC premium(s).  If the stock isn't called away then sell another one to collect even more premium.

2) Sell a cash-secured put (CSP) ATM and expiring the Friday before the ex-date.  This brings in a very nice premium, most times more than the divi.  If assigned sell an ATM or ITM CC for another premium. This profits from the put premium plus the divi and the call premium.  In some cases, the call expires without the stock being called away so another CC can be sold for a higher return.  

Note that if the CSP expires OTM then the trade just keeps the put premium and closes.

The downside is the stock dropping unexpectedly and the premiums collected will help lower the net stock cost so this can be minimal.  Also, it is a good idea to get the stock closed prior to any earning report.

I just bought WDC and collected the divi plus the stock rose from the time I bought it so I sold CCs above the net stock cost so got that plus the premium.  It was a triple dip if you will.

So I’ve been looking for something that would give enough in dividends that reinvesting gains 1 share every time it pays out with a rather low floor to get in, and preferably paid out monthly over quarterly. So I found $SRET, a REIT ETF that pays monthly with a 7.8% yield. Dividend.com tells me that it pays out 0.0983$ per share monthly, with a current share price of 15.11$ quick maths shows that I would only need about 155 shares to gain 1 share monthly, which costs about 2350$USD. So where am I going wrong or am I at all? Because that seems too good to be true and when it feels that way it usually is. Am I actually taxed for these dividends?

&#x200B;

I'm starting a new side project - a website for my own dividend calculations. My current situation is that I am living off my dividends, but also drawing down principal, so I wanted a calculator that could project how long I can last given X expenses and Y yield,. Sure you can have this simply - and I'm sure many of you do - on an excel spreadsheet or something similar, but I wanted to have something a bit more polished

&#x200B;

What am asking all of you is:

What kind of tools, visualizations, analytics, etc. would you want to see that you haven't found out there yet? Are there any tools you have for yourself that you think others would like simple access to? What tools have you found and what do you like about them - do you think it would be helpful to have them located together on a single website?

&#x200B;

Thanks guys and gals - hoping to get some inspiration from you all!

&#x200B;

A couple of my thoughts  to add to my - what is now very simple tool - calculator:

* Integrate with expatriate statistic websites (like [numbeo.com](https://numbeo.com) but they in particular are stingy about their API) to make recommendations on places to live and interesting stats (""you will generate $500/month in 2 years... this is enough to pay for rent in city center in Prague"")
* Certainly profiles of some type if people add individual stocks and holdings as opposed to a '10k at 4% in 5 years' type calculator.
* Integrate with a financial API to grab dividend yields based on user inputting a ticker
* popular stats based on users (if I ever have any heh) '32% of dividend investors have this stock in their portfolio. For 10% of investors, this stock is more than 5% of their portfolio.

GAIN has a lower yield but has had slight dividend growth over the years and it actually pays out two special dividend each year (June and December).

I got a notification about the June special dividend today and looked more into GAIN. Although the yield is much lower, it would possible return more than GOOD can because of it's possible dividend growth AND special dividends.

t3_c9uipq,ABBV dividend growth,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here, but I have been lurking for a while.

&#x200B;

I have recently done some dividend analysis on ABBV, and was looking for some outside opinions as I am strongly considering adding ABBV to my portfolio.  If one examines the average rate of growth on ABBV's dividend since its split from Abbot in 2013, ABBV is growing the dividend at around 18% per year (18.16% is the number I came up with).  This does include a Jan 2018 - Jan 2019 increase of 50%, which is an outlier, and removing that increase from the calculation results in an 11.8% increase year over year (on average).  

&#x200B;

I arrived at these numbers by determining the % increase between each year, and averaging the resulting percentage increases together (as an aside, is this a good way of determining average dividend growth?). 

&#x200B;

Abbot has a smaller year over year increase, around 9% on average each year over 20 years, but since the starting yield if the stock were purchased today is smaller, it does not result in the mammoth possible dividend gains that ABBV does.  However, these were once the same company, and I am wondering if it would be prudent to examine Abbot's dividend growth as part of ABBV's for the years in which the companies were one.  

&#x200B;

If I include Abbot's dividend increases as part of ABBV's in order to get 15 year history, the average annual dividend growth rate is 12.69%, 10.02% if we remove the outlier (2018-2019).  I did not include any calculation for Abbot's dividend payment in 2012 as it relates to ABBV's first dividend payment in 2013.

&#x200B;

Assuming I'm not missing something huge in the way that I am calculating the annual growth, this is still a pretty great dividend growth rate in my opinion, especially with ABBV's current starting yield after the dip. 

&#x200B;

What are your opinions on whether or not this rate of growth is sustainable long term?  Taking the lowest of the above figures (10.02% annual dividend growth), one could get a 39% yield on cost in 20 years, not counting reinvested dividends.  Do you think this is sustainable?  Are there problems in my math?

t3_dhtb85,"19 year old (UK) looking to start, Where? How?","Hi, I'm a 19 year old at university, I want to start looking into dividends seriously. What can I do to learn about how to trade dividend stocks (e.g what books can I buy) and what platform can I use to trade dividends? I know Americans use stuff like robinhood however what can I use in the UK?

When I turned 18 I tried to do Forex using the platform IQ Options and made around £100 profit in a week but that was too much of a luck game and I didn't know what I was doing and didn't want to risk it, so I took a step back and wanted to actually learn properly and learn on making passive income without all these scamming ""guides"" or online courses from instagram ""stock gurus"". 

However I never got round to it until recently I started reading more about dividends and how it's not a get rich quick scheme, which is more attractive to me.

I'm on a tight budget but I can put aside £1200-1500 AT MOST to trade that I can afford to risk (e.g won't make me homeless or starve without it). With that in mind, I'd appreciate if any UK based people could tell me what platform/broker to turn to with that amount of money in mind in case some require you to drop more.",3,0.72,1571071761,"[['IQ', 1]]",EFT,,

""An income investor with over 30-years experience just announced he is revealing his ""#1 dividend stock of the century.""

It’s a small, Houston-based company that is mailing investors 12 checks per year (plus 2 more bonus payouts at any moment).

One reason he loves this stock…

It pays 14 dividends a year!

Not four like normal stocks…

Or even 12 like some monthly payers…

This company sends him 14 checks a year like clockwork.

And unlike the puny 0.75% interest rate the bank pays...

This stock pays a 6% yield (and that doesn’t even include the bonus dividends it pays every June and December).

t3_dmgv8q,Well-performing stocks to hold when starting portfolio? BPY-UN.TO (BPY Nasdaq)? BAC? MO? Or simply start with Dividend Aristocrats?,"   Hey all. 22 year old university student studying business in Canada, majoring in Economics and Finance. In my corporate finance course, we've recently been learning how to value stocks and bonds using different methods. Specifically, how to calculate revenue flows from the face value of bonds and their coupon rates, as well as stock prices based on the intrinsic value an investor places in a company and the dividends received. I've always know this is how the stocks are valued on the market, but haven't had the proper framework of thinking to fully understand this. My father used to tell me often about the power of compounding interest, over and over giving me the ""double a penny every day for 2 months or flat sum"" story, and it hasn't been until now that I've truly realized what that could equate to me personally. That is, if I put in the effort and show the discipline. 

   I've always been a major believer in accumulating wealth and allowing that wealth to work for you. Unfortunately, however, I haven't found the drive or necessity to make that happen for myself. After investing in my education, working hard at a serving position many days during school, and reducing my expenses as much as possible, I am fully committed to setting myself up for success. 

   I currently have about $1000 CAD to start a portfolio, and I have the intention of putting 70% of my tips accrued throughout the month into the portfolio moving forward. This will equate to about $600 CAD a month ($75x3days/week= $225 ; $225x.7 = $157.50 \~\~ $150). I've done a heavy amount of research into which investment style fits my personality and habits best, and the dividend growth method best suits my traits. Day-trading and swing trading feel more like informed (or uninformed, depending on your knowledge level) gambling. Although I do consider myself a risk-taker, I don't believe I have the experience and fortitude to tolerate the short-term, volatile goals of these strategies. I do have school to pay off, but my desire is to grow this portfolio as much as financially possible before I start accruing interest on my loans in just about 2 1/2 years. And to do this, I can't lose all of my assets invested due to my own lack of knowledge or insight.

   Now, I've done a fair amount of research into which stocks offer good yields, have good growth and have compiled a few watch-lists based on the criteria I've outlined. Thanks to a few accounting courses, I can pretty easily find my watch through reported balance sheets, income statements, etc. and have a good understanding of what to look for on these documents. BPY seems like a solid company, with international holdings, a strong investor backing and a forward yield of 6.82%. The only thing that seems to be a bit concerning to me is their assets-to-liabilities, which tells me they could face tight liquidity issues if they do not maintain their rental fees.

   Is this concerning enough to stay away, or is a this a good buy to hold for the future? Options I've looked at is Bank of America Corporation, Visa, Alteria Group, and others listed as dividend aristocrats, as well as quite a few REITS and MLP's.  Am I better of going with ONLY these guaranteed, proven winners, or should I feel confident with companies that pass my own analysis as well as diversify myself with these All-Stars?

   The platforms I've chosen are SimpleWealth Trade due to their commisionless service and IB for their history of being a cheap, trusted broker in Canada. I am using OptionsAlpha free, yahoo finance and finvis to supplement SimpleWealth's lack of analysis tools.

TL;DR: What the title says. I have $1000 CAD AKA Pond Scum, which stocks should I buy to start my dividend investing journey?

Let me explain the BHV and JPST positions: I'm currently saving for a house and I wanted something safe that paid a dividend better than my VMMXX stockpile. The monthly dividends from BHV are state and federal tax-free and it's been going great so far! JPST is taxed as ordinary income and is similar to a money market. That position will probably be pushed to equities as soon as there's a market downturn. Right now the actual numbers are off since it's in the middle of rebalancing. I add $150/week to the pie and I have the selling feature turned off. That means any rebalancing must be done via buying. I know I only have exposure in a few sectors. I'm a huge fan of datacenter REITs. The business is here to stay forever, IMO.

t3_dxj7cg,"Just hit $1,000/month in dividend income!","Hi guys, I've been investing in dividend companies since 2015. Since then I've been putting over half of my salary into these investments. I'm 30 years old, and I work as a marketing manager in a tech startup, where I make about $90k / year.

In September 2015, I made $58.65 in dividends.

In September 2016, I made $208.26

In September 2017, I made $561.74

In September 2018, I made $1176.54

In September 2019, I made $1541.01

(Keep in mind those numbers are just for one month, september, which is a high-dividend month since it's the end of a quarter)

My expected 2020 dividends are: $13,421.85. This means I've hit the $1000/month milestone!

Total portfolio value as of right now: $475,456.55

I totally love dividend growth. My best stock purchases were good companies that had their stock price beaten down. Like T, MMM, ABBV, CVS, MO -- they can give me some very nice principal growth, not just dividend growth. When good companies are on sale, I buy as much as I can! And there's \*always\* something on sale.

My largest holding is T, at about $15,000 -- which is only about 3% of my portfolio, since I like to be very well diversified.

I also have a lot of REITs like O, KIM, SPG. O is kind of expensive now but it's just such a good company. My worse buy is SKT, which is down to $16 now, since I bought it at $24. I'm buying more now that it's lower, since I think it's still a good company.

Not all of my portfolio is dividend-payers -- I also own some tech companies, like OKTA, AMZN, AMD, BABA -- these just get me exposure to possible growth. AMD has been my best buy so far, since I bought it at $12, and it's now $38.

I have over 60 holdings. I accumulated so many because I just really like buying things when they go on sale. And usually that's only a small window of time when good companies are on sale. Then, when the price goes back to normal, I don't buy any more. I just keep the stock, collect divs, and look for other companies on sale. Maybe 60 companies is too many, and I should consolidate some of the more mediocre ones.

Let's say a stock is offering a 10% dividend yield. I'll call it stock X. I want to invest $1000 into stock X which is equivalent to 1 share. And for argument's sake, let's say stock X is a US Stock, not an International stock.

Let's assume the share price doesn't change much from 12/19 to 12/20, so I am due $100 in dividends. Typically, I will receive the $100 a few weeks after the ex-dividend date.

So my questions are:

\- If I buy the stock the day before the ex-dividend date, is there a certain amount of time I need to hold it in order to qualify for the dividend? So if I buy stock X on 12/19, can I sell it on 12/20 (the ex-dividend date) and receive the dividend? Or do I need to wait a day to sell it (12/21)? Or do I need to wait longer, and if so, how long?

\- I'm assuming I can sell after the ex-dividend date and receive the dividend yield (let me know if this isn't correct). If I cycle between many stocks and do this with 2 stocks a week for example, I would be able to turn a decent profit, assuming I invested in very high dividend yield stocks. Will this strategy work? Am I missing something? I understand the potential cons are waiting a few weeks to receive the dividends and/or if the stock share drops a significant amount on its ex-dividend date. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",5,1.0,1576517008,"[['X', 3]]",EFT,,

As a result my 4th Quarter dividend total was $9215.85 vs. the 3rd Quarter which came in at $7514.43.  Most of the increase is due to buying before the ex-dividend date and 2 stocks that I sold after they went ex-dividend and used the cash to buy 2 others that hadn't gone ex-dividend yet.  There were also several stocks which increased their divvy in the 4th quarter.  For the year, all 3 accounts received $31,604.90 in dividends.

Of my 3 accounts, my Roth is very easy to calculate the 2019 returns.  No money except dividends went into the account or came out.  It started the year with $98,258.76 and grew to $136,650.67 producing an increase of $38,391.91 or 39%.  Given that the S&P went up 28.88% I am extremely happy with the performance.

I decided to experiment with my Roth in 2019 since it is my smallest account.  I moved all my REITs into it and most of the stocks were monthly payers.  Unfortunately, when ABBV dropped upon announcing their merger, my Roth was the only account with any cash and I bought it.  ABBV accounts for $10,974 of the total gain on this account.  So my plan for a pure REIT play was foiled.

K - Kellogs

HRB - H&R Block - still need to do taxes

INTU - Intuit (Tax software/service) - still need to do taxes

AZO - AutoZone - you won't have money for a new car, or costly dealership service. Fix it yourself!

BF.B - BrownForman - Jack Daniels - lots of stress, probably going to drink away some pain.

BMY - Bristol-Myers Squibb

MKC - McCormik - cheap cheap food. need to spice it up to make it taste better.

HRL - Hormel (SPAM!!) - Cant afford ribeye! good ol SPAM

V - Visa - no cash, need to borrow to make ends meet.

CHD - Church and Dwight - Consumer Brands, ie Arm&Hammer,OxiClean,Orajel

t3_esccrj,Renewable energy dividend stocks,"Over the last week I have been looking at opening a new position in a company that is making moves to capitalize on the finally growing renewable energy sector.

I understand that NEE is probably #1 on everyone’s list, but because it’s the most obvious I’ll pass on throwing down info on it.

I decided to look into PEGI, TAC and SU

From doing research, it looks like PEGI is going to be going private here soon. This kills any chance of a long term hold.

TAC is sitting around $7.50 a share and offers a $0.0425 dividend per quarter. They took a pretty major hit a few years ago due to regulations in Canada but have been making strong moves into renewables for a while now. I expect that looking into the future they will continue to grow their dividend and has the potential of being bought out by a larger company like NEE in the future. It looks like recently the price has been starting to go back up and has a good future outlook. 

SU is one I’m unsure on still. They had some bad news the last couple days being told to halt work in confined areas and the likes. This drove their price down a few %. They look to be moving into the renewable section, but at a pretty slow rate. Their price looks better with their recent slide in price $33.35 and a dividend of $0.3163. I don’t foresee SU dropping drastically, but I’m unsure of its long term future with their slow pace towards renewables.",10,0.92,1579701845,"[['NEE', 2], ['TAC', 1], ['SU', 1]]",EFT,,

t3_etqd4o,Baseline Stock: Is it better than Coke (KO)?,"So, as some of you know, im new to dividends and learning a lot here. thank you for everyones help.

Coke (KO) for me, seems to be a slow steady stock. very consistent in payouts, always raising dividends for 50+ years. Its not just a dividend aristocrat, but its in the KING category. You cant go ""wrong"" with Coke. It can ride through recessions, and keeps climbing. slowly.

you may have also seen some of my experiments: I randomly purchase or not purchase stock, every market day, from a certain year. and see what my returns would be today.

TICKER   return\_on\_capital + return\_on\_dividends = total\_return

KO   112.65% + 1.63% = 114.28%    year=2019  <== started buying in 2019

KO   119.01% + 3.32% = 122.34%   year=2018

KO   122.68% + 5.17% = 127.84%   year=2017

KO   124.98% + 6.80% = 131.78%    year=2016

KO   127.45% + 8.48% = 135.93%    year=2015

KO   148.91% + 20.56% = 169.46%    year=2010

KO   192.22% + 42.35% = 234.58%    year=2000 <== started buying in 2000

the randomness is important. Its to show what would happen if i DO NOT try to time the market. Sometimes i buy high, and sometimes i buy low. Who knows, who cares. for now.

So if you started buying in 2000, you would be up on average 234% (not dripping). with little volatility. Theres a very good chance your results would be similar.

So now, when i ask ,""Is this (XXX) a good stock?"" well..compared to what? So now im comparing to Coke. If it hasn't beat grandpa Coke historically, it has a high probability it won't do it in the future.

Then i thought, what stocks (paying dividends) would probably have done better than KO? What about WALMART?

WMT   105.77% + 0.97% = 106.74%    year=2019

WMT   114.19% + 2.10% = 116.29%    year=2018

WMT   122.74% + 3.34% = 126.08%    year=2017

WMT   130.98% + 4.72% = 135.70%    year=2016

WMT   136.12% + 6.13% = 142.24%    year=2015

WMT   153.06% + 13.15% = 166.21%   year=2010

WMT   180.84% + 25.05% = 205.90%    year=2000

Coke, actually returned more than Walmart. Not saying WALMART is a bad stock. i don't think it is. Its just that WALMART has similar volatility, and returned less. Less than Coke. And if you goal is to live off of dividends, KO returned more in dividends, over the same period.

Lets look at one of our favorites, O - Realty Income Corp.

O   107.10% + 1.90% = 109.00%    year=2019

O   120.42% + 4.22% = 124.64%    year=2018

O   124.14% + 6.35% = 130.49%   year=2017

O   124.80% + 8.58% = 133.38%   year=2016

O   130.62% + 11.07% = 141.69%    year=2015

O   157.77% + 24.76% = 182.52%   year=2010

O   248.19% + 75.00% = 323.18%    year=2000

Comparing O and KO, Coke actually is winning in 2019. Then slowly falls back. O appears to give better average Returns over the long haul. But we need to keep in mind that O is way more volatile than KO. Its a REIT, so its taxed as ordinary income, instead of KO's qualified status.

Once you find companies that have performed historically BETTER than Coke (based on your personal criteria), then you would have to look DEEPLY into the company data to see if they are on track to continue performing in the future.

I post this to get feedback. To see if my thinking is flawed. Any and all suggestions are welcome, appreciated and desired. Especially if they conflict with my own.

**LTC**

On January 31, 2020, my **428.7895 shares** of **LTC** paid a cash dividend of $**81.47.** 

I DRIPed the payment and received **1.7528 shares** at a price of **$46.48.** 

This bought an additional **$0.33 cash dividend per month**. 

Next month, I expect to receive a **$85.79 cash dividend.** 

The $4.32 jump is mostly due to $1,000 of external capital that will be invested on February 14, 2020. The ex-dividend date for the February 28, 2020 payment is February 19, 2020, so the additional $1,000 will be included on this distribution. In order to estimate the future payment, I use today’s price as the Settlement Price. At today’s price, the February 14, 2020 investment will yield these results:

$1000 / $46.83 = 21 shares.

21 shares \* $0.19 per share = $3.99 additional dividend

Plus $0.33 from the January Distribution = $3.99 + $0.33 = $4.32

I will try to add that $5.88 to the February 28, 2020 $1000 investment (btw, I will be investing $1,000 into GOOD on February 28), but it will be difficult because that will result only in a fraction of a share.

Annuities don't interest me due to the legal complications associated with them. I am attempting to utilize my capital to provide additional monthly income of approximately $400-500  using less than $50k capital.

I've been looking for a relatively stable large cap stock with a decent (+5%) dividend to try a more aggressive approach using covered calls to pep up the returns. The stock needed to at the bottom of its 52 week range with a large float, actively traded, and decent IV on options.

I bought 1000 shares of British Petroleum (BP) during the week of Feb 10th, ensuring that I made the ex-dividend date of 2/13/20. Purchase price was $36.31. Dividend per share is $.62

I sold 10 covered calls expiring next month, receiving $.26 premium on March 20 '20 - strike price of 38, netting $260 in premium.

Month 1 potential results: BP closes below $38:

Dividend (paid in April) +$620 plus +$260 CC premium = (+$880 -capital erosion) (%?)

If BP closes above $38: $1669 appreciation + $620 dividend  + $260 premium = +$2549 (+7.0 %)

After reassessing company stability, stock price action, and making adjustments,  rinse and repeat.

Annual return should be +20% annually, or

Second, in July of 2012 I created my monthly dividend portfolio plan. On that day, I decided in March of 2020 I was going to purchase these shares. I just wanted to throw that out there. If you want to properly apply DCA (dollar cost average), a big swing in one month shouldn't impact your investment choices. There will be current events that impact the stock market for the rest of your investment timeline and they should be ingrained into your plan.

If you are trying to ""time"" the market, then I'd say go for it because it is WAY more fun and interesting than consistently investing in income producing assets over an endless period - but consider having some side capital for those transactions. Don't mistake your choices for ones backed my academia or trends. I see a lot of posts commenting on ""dip"" buying as if it is something credible, but remember that it is just for fun. I too bought some extra stuff because the yields are ridiculous, but that didn't change my investment plan. Hey everyone, newsflash: Prices are down and yields are up!

\--------------------------------------------------------------

On February 28, 2020, my 450.5478 shares of LTC paid a **cash dividend of $85.60.**

**This is up $4.13** from January because the [January DRIP](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/2/4/january-recap-83592-in-cash-dividends) bought **an additional $0.33** and [February 14 ](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/2/18/february-14-payday)payday bought an **additional $3.80.** 

I DRIPed the payment and **received 1.8536** shares at a **price of $46.18.** This buys **an additional $0.35 cash dividend per month**. 

Next month, I expect to receive a **$90.09 cash dividend.** 

The $4.49 increase for March is mostly due to $1,000 of external capital that will be invested on March 13, 2020. The ex-dividend date for the March 31, 2020 payment is March 23, 2020, so the additional $1,000 will be included on the March distribution. In order to estimate the future payment, I use today’s price as the Settlement Price. At today’s price, the March 13, 2020 investment will yield these results:

$1000 / *$45.92* = 21.78 shares.

21.78 shares \* $0.19 per share = $4.14 additional dividend

Plus $0.33 from the February Distribution = $4.14 + $0.35 = $4.49

Plus the February distribution = $85.60 + $4.49 = $90.09

t3_fej5a9,PROJECT DRIP MY TFSA FOR LIFE,"Hello All,

First time poster here. Little back story, I'm 27 yrs old and have been investing on and off since I was 18 Yrs old. By the time I was 19 yrs old I had $20,000 invested with about $6600 in BNS, ENB and BCE all enrolled in DRIPS.

Fast forward a hot minute and I became impatient quickly with the lack of excitement and slow movement so I pulled my then $30,000 (not all gains, I kept adding to my TFSA) and stumbled upon the up and coming marijuana industry. I did day trades, got approved for options, and messed around unknowingly gambling for about 4 years and ended up doubling my money to $60,000.

By pure luck I was at the point in my life where it was a good time for me to buy a house so I liquidated 100% of my investments and had just enough for 20% down on my current home. This just so happened to be right before legalization when the marijuana market to its big first hit.

I thought I was hot shit and could read the market like a god... I was so wrong and it took a little over a year being out of the market to realize how lucky I was.

If I had of left my original drips alone in the beginning and just kept adding the $500 a month as planned the account would be sitting around the 100K mark or more today.

All that being said, I just started back in the market this week with my first purchase of 80 shares in BCE. As seen in the picture my plan is to max out my TFSA as quickly as possible buying a new stock every-time I have $2500 saved away. All stocks will be enrolled in DRIP and when the TFSA is maxed I will switch to the $500/month contributions.

All that being said, next time the next big thing comes around like (the marijuana market) I will be leaving my DRIPS the F&%$ alone!

I look forward to hearing your opinions on my strategy and the stocks I tentatively have chosen as seen above.

Cheers,

**TL/DR:**

I should of left my DRIPS alone and not gambled in the MARIJUANA industry... Got lucky once but probably wont happen again. Pictured above is my new DRIP plan for my TFSA.

TJX Companies (TJX), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods store chains, said Thursday it was suspending its stock repurchase program, evaluating its dividend program and cutting capital expenditures as it looks to maintain financial liquidity and flexibility given uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's current dividend yield was 2.25%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500 of 2.52%. The retailer said it was also drawing down $1 billion from its credit facilities, and withdrawing its financial guidance. And starting Thursday, TJX said it is closing all of its stores in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia for two weeks, and temporarily closing its distribution centers and offices. The company said it plans to pay its store, distribution center and office employees for two weeks during the closures. The stock was little changed in midday trading, erasing an earlier gain of as much as 3.7%. Over the past month, the stock has slid 36.0%, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) has declined 34.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 31.3%.

This is only being offered at a discount due to coronavirus and hasn't been at a 17 p/e since 2014. Short term headwinds will cause a drop in EPS until the virus is settled and this will be a prime candidate to explode once the virus is contained.

I'd like to highlight the company's undervaluation by comparing it to Costco a company that I think we can all agree has been a very good stock for investors this decade. Costco's business also focuses on discount prices to consumers so I find it to be a fair comparison. ( BTW I'm bullish on COST as well)

t3_fuxkpf,Living off Dividends (avg $1000 + a week) during COVID19 Pandemic and Stock Market tank,"I'm happy I found this community! There're other posts just massacring dividend stocks as an investment strategy for cutting or suspending payments due to COVID19.

The husband and I earned approx. $4650 a month on dividend payments. The investment portfolio value is approx 650k with a yield of an average of 8.5% (a combination of income funds, ETFs, REITs, regular stocks). we use the dividend payments to pay all our living expenses and continue to invest with my husband's salary. I quit my corporate job in 2019 and he works for a major Airline (btw we're in Canada)we're obviously worried about how all of the shutdowns to business would affect this situation. living off of passive income from dividends is something we work towards during our GRIND phase and now it was all put into question!! We know an 8.5% yield is a bit risky, but we're still young and practicing the passive income investing strategy of buy and hold.At it's worse our total investment value dropped 30%!! but the good news is that surprisingly almost all our dividends paid out and we're still living off dividends.  The dividend cuts we experience represented 18%, ($VET -Vermilion Energy, was the biggest chunk)

Therefore, returning us approx $3850 in dividend payouts instead of the $4650.

Anyway, just wanted to share a personal story of living off of Dividends during the COVID19 pandemic. The husband and I created a Youtube channel during the two-week quarantine about Passive Income Investing. In the videos, he shares our complete portfolio and talks on each investment, since he's been in research mode the entire time we've been working and saving. Every month we'd look forward to which fund or ETF, or REIT to invest in. We'd do the research and really understand their business. This is mainly because early on we were with our parent's financial advisors, who made the simplest safest investment and charged a hefty management fee. A bit of light reading made us understand how we could do it ourselves for a fraction of that management fee AND get comfortable with a little higher risk tolerance. We're both noobs to creating videos, but passionate about reaching people to help them get comfortable and knowledgeable about passive income investing don't want to self promote on the post so DM me if you're interested in the link to the Youtube Channel.

 Edit: Thanks for all your interest. I wasn't sure if I could self promote the link on this post, but I saw someone else post their link so I figure I can post mine: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSKsvUTiunCbAmV5sZ5nBQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSKsvUTiunCbAmV5sZ5nBQ)",128,0.97,1586021133,"[['DM', 1]]",EFT,,
t3_fut8ky,March Recap: $873.84 in Cash Dividends,"This article is articulated in table form [here](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/4/3/march-recap-87384-in-cash-dividends)

The gist:

1. GAIN is trading under $9, I believe this is now a buy
2. LTC represents the senior living sector. I believe this is now a very risky stock. Buy if you are feeling confident, but stay away if near-term volatility bothers you
3. I disengaged the DRIP last month because I was upset at the settlement prices. I've decided to turn it back on moving forward

\-------------

LTC

On March 31, 2020, my 452.4014 shares of LTC paid a **cash dividend of $85.96.**

**This is up $0.36** from February because the [February DRIP](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/3/2/february-recap-85167-in-cash-dividends1).

I took cash in lieu of shares and **purchased 3** **shares** at a **price of $27.86.** This buys **an additional $0.57 cash dividend per month**. 

Next month, I expect to receive a **$86.53 cash dividend.** 

I originally planned on purchasing $1,000 of LTC shares per month until I reached $25,000 of capital invested. However, [my favorite dividend stock, GAIN, has fallen below the $9.00 threshold ](https://www.covercalled.com/finance-blog/2019/2/11/gain-12-buck-chuck)that triggers buying.

I’ve decided to instead contribute to GAIN until LTC looks more attractive or GAIN looks less.

\-----------------------

GOOD

On March 31, 2020, my 121.6279 shares of GOOD paid a **cash dividend of $15.22.**

**This is up $3.46** from February because of the [February DRIP](https://www.covercalled.com/dividend-portfolio-blog/2020/3/2/february-recap-85167-in-cash-dividends1) and $498.29 of capital invested on February 28, 2020. This purchased 27 shares at $18.45.

I took cash in lieu of shares and waited too long on April 3, 2020 to reinvest. On Monday, April 6, 2020, I will purchase 2 shares.

Next month, I expect to receive a **$15.47 cash dividend.** 

\--------------------

GAIN

On March 31, 2020, my 180 shares of GAIN paid a **cash dividend of $12.60.** Even though I now own 353 shares, only 180 of those were acquired before the March ex-dividend date.

I love the management team behind GAIN and have a rule that I purchase this stock when the price is under $9.00. 

The bulk of my GAIN shares came from an investment of $990.64 on March 13, 2020, purchasing 112 shares at $8.85, and an investment of $995.28 on March 27, purchasing 122 shares at $8.16.

I took the cash dividend of $12.60 and purchased 3 additional shares for $7.28 each with a little extra cash.

Next month, I expect to receive a **$24.71 cash dividend.** However, I may also invest another $1,000 on April 10, 2020, depending on how the world is looking. This would be before the 4/20/2020 ex-dividend date and would add to the April dividend.",25,0.96,1586004901,"[['GAIN', 6], ['LTC', 4]]",EFT,,
t3_fv4lff,GREAT VALUE! $O Realty Corp,"TLDR; Price > $45 Attractive.

Fellow investors,

As we all know **COVID-19** is affecting every aspect of our lives, but it is also presenting many buying opportunities in our market. **$O Realty Corp** is one of them.

Some Quick Metrics @ $45/SHARE :

* Current Dividend = $0.233 /Month
* Current Yield = 6.21%
* Total Debt to Total Assets = 43.28
* EBITDA = 29.46
* Debt to EBITDA = 5.87
* Price to Book Ratio = 2.51
* RSI = 34 (not oversold yet)
* Price to Cash Flow Ratio = 21.78

Its current drop 47%-%50 from ATH is the largest drop in the company's stock history. 08-09 it was 42%.

Its historical yield has rarely gone over 5%

16.5 % compound annual total return.

4.5% Compound Annualized Dividend Growth.

Consistently Keep Occupancy Above 97 %

Had a public offering of 9,000,000 shares @ 77.40 that closed March 2nd LMAO

""Net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $677 million. The company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,350,000 additional shares of common stock. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings outstanding under its $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and, to the extent not used for that purpose, to fund potential investment opportunities and/or for other general corporate purposes.""

**Summary**: $O Realty Corp is an **ELITE REIT** that not only trades at a premium to its peers, but rarely trades at an attractive discounted valuation. For long term investors this valuation is an absolute steal. To dividend investors its an opportunity to add world class company to their portfolio.

**RISKS**: **COVID-19** drags on for more than 3 months, dividend possibly in danger. Government Stimulus is currently a ""life-line"" for some businesses that O Realty Corp rents to and if it dries up they go under and O Realty Corp loses a tenant in them. I am sure that Management is doing everything possible to minimize damage and taking advantage of any program and or opportunities that present themselves to fortify the company,",30,1.0,1586046713,"[['O', 4], ['RSI', 1]]",EFT,,

t3_g4qw7d,Costco vs Coke,"On April 15, 2020, Costco ($COST) announced they have increased their dividend 8%! 

Costco is generally not on our dividend radar, probably due to their crap initial buy in dividend of 0.82% annual dividend yield.  ( $0.65 per quarter X 4 times a year ) / $317 stock price

But we are long term investors. (Yes we are! say it to yourself 100 times in the mirror, every day! ha!). So lets look just a little bit deeper, especially the dividend growth.

Last year, Costco increased their dividend 14.04%. the year before that 14%, before that 11.11%..

Annual Dividend Growth: 14.04%, 14%, 11.11%, 12.50%, 12.68%, 14.52%, 12.73%, 14.58%, 17.07%, 13.89%

the 5 year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is 12.86%

Now we have 2 variables, the initial buy in dividend yield, and its 5 year CAGR. 0.82% and 12.86%. So, is that good? dunno. Lets try to compare it to something we like, like $KO Coke.

$KO Coke, has an initial buy in dividend yield of 3.41%! very good for coke! Its generally not in the 3% range! Last time it was in the 4% range was during the 2008 meltdown. Its a Dividend Aristocrat, paying and increasing dividends for 50+ years!

But its growth is dwindling:

Annual Dividend Growth: 2.50%, 2.56%, 5.41%, 5.71%, 6.06%, 8.20%, 8.93% 9.8%, 8.51%, 6.82%

the 5 year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is 4.44%

its 2 variables are 3.41% initial buy in dividend yield, and 4.44% CAGR.

So, which of these two stocks are ""better""?  dunno..too many numbers, giving me a headache :)

Lets figure out how many years it would take for the stock to reach a 10% annual dividend yield! 

COSTCO: at 12.86% CAGR, starting at 0.82%, it will take 21 years.

COKE: at 4.44% CAGR, starting at 3.41%, it will take 25 years.

If you bought COSTCO on 2004-05-06, for $36.30, it paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10, which is an initial buy in dividend yield of 1.1%.. still not on our radar.. but TODAY, you would be receiving a 7.16% dividend yield.. 

If you bought COKE on 2004-06-15, for $51.38 (non adjusted), it paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 (non adjusted), which is an initial buy in dividend yield of 1.95%.. but TODAY, you would be receiving 6.38% dividend yield.

That was 16 years ago, and the forecast seems sorta accurate. That in 6-9 more years,  they would hit approx 10%.

We essentially distilled the stocks 2 variables into one number (the number of years it takes to hit 10%). And based on **JUST THIS INFORMATION**, Costco wins, by a tad. 

So, although many of us dividend investors screens stocks based on their initial annual dividend yield, we could be missing out on companies that start with a lower yield, but with amazing dividend growth.",56,0.98,1587381209,"[['X', 1], ['KO', 1], ['COKE', 1]]",EFT,,

I have a Roth IRA with only ETFs, but wanted to take advantage of the recent bump in the road to build out a brokerage account. Thank you in advance for checking this out!



After about 150 hours of research, this is where my current build out stands: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VKx22VbH60mV2e5zmJjr-9ejrZLZ3R-brnzneBEOETo/edit#gid=0


**Some quick notes about the spreadsheet:**

- I've calculated the current price to the 52w high just to get an idea the volatility of the stock. 
- The dividend safety is from Simply Safe Dividends. 
- ""My sector target"" is the percentage of each stock I would like in that specific sector. For example I have JPM set as 35% of the financial sector. Because financials are currently set at 10%, JPM would consist of 3.5% of my total portfolio. 
- I have a random 3ish year growth section. The is the growth of the stock from 4/20/17 - 2/14/20. This is right before the crash started to happen and 4/2/17 is as far back as the tool would let me go. That's why its random dates. I'm not putting too much stake into these numbers, but it helps a little. 
- The target shares number is there to help me choose exactly how many shares I need to purchase in the end to build this out how I want it. I have set $100,000 at the top just as a random number (this is not my real number). Just an even number to make everything easy to visualize. 

**What I really need help with:**

- I had trouble choosing the percentage that each sector should represent. Any opinions on if I am too high or low on some?
- I spend many hours trying to research all these stocks but I am sure I missed info on many/few. Are there stocks I should be looking at? Some I should consider removing? And am I too high or low of sector share on some of these?",3,0.72,1587483321,"[['JPM', 2]]",EFT,,

I decided not to hold oil stocks as I do not beleive in oil as I am buying these stocks for my lifetime and beyond. I see the demand for oil to be less dependent than the prior 50+ years. I'm not holding communication stocks either becasue I'm not a fan of VZ or T (If I picked one then it would be VZ and have a similar weight to O).

My question would be: has all of this bad news been priced into the stock already? Or can WFC continue to slide even further down if our economy stays bad for the next 6 months. 

I’m looking to buy in, and I do believe in WFC long term, but am looking to see if I could pick up some shares at an even more discounted price.

They doubled the number of shares, but kept half of them! Wouldn't this be like a 2-1 split? shouldn't the stock price get cut in half?

If we have a pie, cut in 4 pieces, and YOU own 2 pieces. Thats 50%.

If i then cut the pie into 8 pieces, and you STILL own 2 pieces, now that's only 25%

If you double the pieces in the pie, you ""SHOULD"" double the pieces owned.

I personally like $O, but something seems odd to me

&#x200B;

edit: below, adding more info from the Annual Report

**Capital Philosophy (page 35)**

Historically, we have met our long-term **capital needs by issuing common stock**, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure; however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. **We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities.** However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.

On page 34 of Annual Report . General idea of how shares outstanding is growing over past 5 years. So this jump to 740k is crazy. (EDIT: 740k is authorized, NOT outstanding..read comments below for explanation)

2015 = 235k shares outstanding

2016 = 255k shares outstanding

2017 = 273k shares outstanding

2018 = 289k shares outstanding

2019 = 316k shares outstanding

***now 740k??? wow!!!!!  (EDIT: 740k is authorized.. and NOT shares outstanding, read comments for explanation)***

At December 31, 2019, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loans, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $7.9 billion, or approximately 24.4% of our total market capitalization of $32.5 billion.

Dec, 2019: Shares of our common stock outstanding of 333,619,106, plus total common units outstanding of 463,119, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $73.63per share on December 31, 2019, or $24.6 billion;

&#x200B;

**Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders (page 42)**

We have continued our 51-year policy of paying monthly dividends. In addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2019 and twice in 2020. As of February 2020, we have paid 89 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 105 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.

***Why increase the dividend amount so many times in 2019? Maybe they feel bad about doubling the shares and we didn't get anything?***

Also in January 2020, we announced that Paul Meurer, our EVP, **Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, is leaving the company.** To ensure a smooth transition, Mr. Meurer will serve as a senior advisor to the company through March 31, 2020. The company has begun a search for a new Chief Financial Officer.

Maybe the CFO is disgusted. i hope im wrong.

I quickly ran thru the Annual Report..i will probably do it again and double check their numbers.

***Suspension of Common Dividend*** \- The Company is suspending its common dividend for the second quarter of 2020 as the Board and management believe it is prudent to conserve cash during this period of uncertainty. If maintained for the balance of the year, the dividend will result in savings of approximately $175 million relative to the prior $0.11 per share quarterly dividend. As the Company continues its pivot to digital infrastructure, the Board of Directors will evaluate go-forward dividend policy in alignment with an increased emphasis on a ‘total return’ approach, which focuses more on capital appreciation relative to current yield as components of total shareholder return.

t3_ghhym8,What to do with fractional shares when switching from Robinhood to Fidelity?,"Recently I made the decision to switch from Robinhood to Fidelity. With the way fractional shares are handled in transferring I’m wondering what is the best move for me.

I came down to a couple of options:

1) Have a full asset transfer with having the fractional shares sold and moved as cash.

2) Sell the fractional shares before the transfer and use the cash to buy enough to complete whole shares. Example buy 0.5 shares of KO if I already have 1.5 shares.

3) Do a partial asset transfer and keep my fractional shares in Robinhood while my whole shares go to Fidelity.

I’m leading towards option 2 but the thing is I have less than 1 share of AAPL and JNJ. I could buy enough to complete 1 share if JNJ, but that would leave with my AAPL shares in Robinhood. I could do a full transfer and have the AAPL shares sold in Robinhood and rebuy in Fidelity. 

I do plan on keeping Robinhood and use it mostly for growth stocks and have Fidelity as my passive income dividend portfolio. So naturally I would like to remove everything from my account.

Immediately when I see a chart that has never really been green I tend to shy away, but I still see recommendations from time to time with stocks like this. One post today mentions $WBA. I've seen it especially with tobacco and alcohol stocks, $BUD and $MO are examples here.

Why is this?

Are we expected to dollar cost average in at every opportunity and pray for a spike when ready to sell?

Or maybe need to sell out after dividend issued, before market corrects and buy back in? Seems counterintuitive for long goals

Maybe there's an overall net gain I can't see. Any software recommendations that will show combined div and stock price so I can see this? I've been playing around in sheets, I can pull div history from NASDAQ and the price data, could combine these I suppose.

Common Stock Dividend

On May 9, 2020, the Company's board of directors **approved the payment of the Company's previously declared dividend for the first quarter of 2020 of $0.50 per share of common stock** (the ""first quarter dividend""). The first quarter dividend will be paid on June 30, 2020 in a combination of **cash and shares** of the Company's common stock to stockholders of record as of May 21, 2020. Given the uncertain and rapidly changing financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's board of directors has determined that the cash component of the first quarter dividend (other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) **will not exceed 10% in the aggregate, or $0.05 per share**, with the balance payable in shares of the Company's common stock. This will allow the Company to preserve capital and enhance the Company's financial flexibility.

In accordance with the provisions of the applicable IRS Revenue Procedures, stockholders will be asked to make an election to receive the first quarter dividend all in cash or all in shares. To the extent that stockholders elect to receive more than 10% of the aggregate payment in cash, the cash portion of the payment will be prorated. **Stockholders who elect to receive the dividend in cash will receive a cash payment of at least $0.05 per share**. Stockholders who elect to receive the dividend in Company common stock will only receive shares of Company common stock. **Additionally, stockholders who do not make an election will receive 90% of the dividend in Company common stock and 10% of the dividend payment in cash.** The number of shares issued as a result of the dividend will be calculated based upon the volume weighted average trading prices of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on June 17, June 18 and June 19, 2020. **Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares so that stockholders receive a whole number of shares of common stock.**

* $F - Ford - 2 Shares

I originally had my portfolio to take $100 monthly and auto invest it into my target date fund but I just finished growing my emergency fund so I am looking to increase it to $500 to reach my goal. Aside from that though I have $2000 extra that I can put towards my portfolio right now and with that I was planning on diversifying my portfolio a bit.

After looking around at dividend stocks I came up with the following:

* $GLAD - \~100 Shares so every month I get a new one with the dividends - \~$600
* $SRET - Same idea as $GLAD - \~$600
* $O and $SCHH - Rest of the money evenly split between the 2

t3_gms1ki,Wanted Some Feedback on ETF Portfolio,"Hey everybody, I like to lurk in this sub and see what people are talking about. I just finished putting together my portfolio. I switched from Robinhood to M1 Finance, and I've been playing around with some of my pies and their distributions. I think I've finally got it where I want it and I wanted to see what you guys thought. 

A little background on me is that I'm 29 with a disability pension I got for injuries sustained while in the military. I started investing two years ago. My SO is a chemical engineer who, before being laid off due to CV19, was making in the six-figures. My disability is fortunately enough to cover us for the time being, and she's using the time off to get a Master's degree. So the outlook on the other side of the pandemic is still high. I'm a huge believer in dividend investing and my general attitude is to never sell anything. My hope is that after I die, I have enough money left in the nest egg that we can use the distributions for a scholarship fund to send someone every year to the community college that set me up for success after I left the military. 

I do have some single stocks, but I don't foresee buying more.

So, enough of that. Here's the split:

**45% US Stocks (5.729% DY, 0.22% ER)**

- 40% $SPHD *(5.77% DY, 0.3% ER)* [Monthly]
- 40% $SPYD *(6.69 DY, 0.07% ER)*
- 20% $DON  *(3.72% DY, 0.38% ER)* [Mid-Cap, Monthly]

**34% International Stocks (7.12% DY, 0.54% ER)**

- 60% $EFAS *(7.53% DY, 0.56 ER)* [Ex-US, Monthly]
- 20% $PID *(6.06% DY, 0.54% ER)* [~90% Ex-US Dividend Achievers]
- 20% $DVYA *(6.96% DY, 0.49% ER)* [Asia / Pacific]

I feel like I'm well-diversified among sectors, investment vehicles, and geography. Each section has at least one holding that pays monthly dividends and the rest are quarterly payments. I tried to balance DY and ER, and I think I did that to some success. It definitely isn't the highest-yielding portfolio I could have built, but it seems to be balanced and realistic, given my timeframe. As I said, I'd love to know what you guys think of this.

t3_gn1t5r,Moving away from passively investing to trying to take control of my finances,"Redditors/
(33M) Looking for investment advice. I have been passively investing for years and have accumulated a reasonable amount of money in various types of investment vehicles. During this pandemic, I have taken a vested interest in how my money was ‘working’ for me, however, with all these investment vehicles, it has proven to be quite challenging to decide how/if I should consolidate. This is coupled with the fact that I really don’t understand them all and was blindly saving. This probably cost me a lot of money over the years.

So, here is a breakdown:

401 (K) – Current Value: $60K Traditional and Roth with company match

Before: Maxing 401 (K) Contributions in Traditional 401(K)
· 70% Target Date fund
· 20% S&P Index Equity Fund
· 10 % Employee Stock Ownership Plan Fund (Aerospace and Defense Company)
 
After: Maxing 401 (K) contributions with mix of 8% Pre-tax and 11% Roth (total of $19,500/year)
· 60% S&P Index Equity fund
· 30% ESOP Fund
· 10% Target Date fund
 
Plan:  Keep current mixed contributions with 60/30 split going into S&P and ESOP because they have a low expense ratio (0.03%). Performance seems solid to me. I want to transfer the 10% Target Date Fund to a Self-Directed Brokerage Account (SDBA) from the employee 401 (K) and push it into VTI/VIG. The other options in the 401(K) is not worth investing in.
 
Thrift Savings Plan - Current Value: $15K Pre-tax Contribution.

Before: - No longer able to contribute- Had this since 2008

· 100% G-Fund (Bonds)
 
After:

· 60% C-Fund – S&P 500 Index
· 40% S-Fund – DOW Jones Total Stock Market Index
 
Plan: The net expense of this is 0.04%. I plan on keeping it in here, however, for easier management I might move it over to the new IRA SDBA account and invest in similar Index Funds.

Mutual Funds – Current Value ~$100K (Brokerage account)

After: No contributions since 2015
· 6.8% PRWCX – Capital Appreciation Fund
· 9.9% PRMTX - Communications & Technology
· 22.5% PRHSX – Health Sciences
· 26.8% PRWAX – New America Growth Fund
· 23.8% PRNHX – New Horizons Fund
· 10.2% OTCFX – Small-Cap Stock Fund
 
Plan: I haven’t contributed anything to these mutual funds since 2015 after an initial investment of ~$45K. It grew in value based on dividends (avg. $600/year) and capital gain distributions (avg. $6000/year) which gets reinvested to their respective funds. Honestly, I just realized that I’ve been paying capital gain taxes of around 15%-20% on these distributions every year. This is what really prompted me to seek help. Should I slowly move these over to a traditional IRA for tax purposes? Between me and my wife we should be able to individually contribute $6K each/year. Please correct if my assumption is wrong. Our Adjusted Gross Income this year will be less than $193K.
 
Other Investments:
Now: Current hold shares of $AAPL (10), $DAL(230), and $VIG (54) in a regular brokerage account. Sold off $TSLA a couple of weeks ago, and plan on buying some $JPM, $VTI, $VIG through IRA SDBA account.
 
Overall Goal:
I want to accumulate enough dividend income to retire off, however, I would like to take advantage of growth investments. I’m currently saving around 30% of my paycheck into 401(K) and HSA. Emergency fund is greater $30K, probably too much in my opinion because I don’t have large expenses (house is paid-off). So, I can probably save/invest an additional 10-20% of my income. I'm okay if you guys tell me to go back to the drawing board and redo everything. It doesn’t look like I’m very diversified- majority of my current investment is in US stocks.

t3_grpelw,"Stocks are going up, but for how long?","Disclaimer: This post is purely speculative. 

As of the current pandemic, stocks have plummeted to lows we haven’t seen in a decade during a historically great bull market. Companies giving out dividends have slowed and some have cut them entirely with the possibility of them being restored being unknown; however, the markets have been going up for nearly a month or so and seem to continue to be climbing. Along with an increasingly healthy stock market, it is possible that companies who lowered or outright cut their dividends could soon bring them back to where they were prior to 2020. 

With this in mind, anyone who has invested for a notable amount of time should know that the stock market will always have ups and downs and is not entirely tied to the health of the economy. It is true that the stock market CAN be an indicator of the overall health of the economy, but is absolutely an entirely separate entity. Just because stores and companies (in the U.S. at least) are slated to begin reopening does not necessarily mean that, financially speaking, we will see an increased upturn in stocks. 

So what should we expect? Personally I could see stocks soar by perhaps 10% on average throughout the summer, maybe even more. But keep in mind that 2020 is an election year and nearly every election brings uncertainty in the markets. Normally roughly a week or so surrounding the election sees some stocks plummet and others rise with an eventual correction.

Honestly I forgot where I was going with this post as I was typing it, but do keep in mind these points as you continue to invest. It is still a good time to buy stocks, and those companies who have continued to pay out their normal dividends (I have LEG, RIO, and KO for example) should be considered highly valuable due to them having the ability to maintain success and viability despite everything else happening right now. 

What do you expect from the stock market throughout the remainder of the year? Share your thoughts!",4,0.75,1590604384,"[['KO', 1]]",EFT,,

t3_gsjja2,Opinions on my portfolio. Started 2 months ago.,"For the info, I've just turned 19 and I've started my portfolio recently 2 months ago. Was looking for advice from more experienced dividend investors.

My main worry, apart from the over-exposure in Real Estate, was the fact that I might be falling in a yield trap. Currently looking at an average yield of 16% for the whole portfolio.

I mainly wanted an opinion on my current strategy that is to play some risky stocks, high-risk high-reward for the time being. I'm aware that these stocks have limited dividend growth potential especially MFA and NYMT, but the current yields I will get once they go back up would be phenomenal. I would then slowly transfer to lower yielding stocks but that have better dividend growth potential.

For example, I bought EPD, MO, T, BEN, OKE, XOM, PBA and some  others which seem enough safe but did very little research on most of them, just the enoigh to convince myself dividend is unlikely to get cut. 
I do more reasearch on other companies but then I think, aff, this yield sucks, the growth is not that good, I'm not going anywhere soon, I dont wan't to go under 7% avg yield.

I do my monthly deposit and damn, I cant wait to buy random shares from my watchlist and spending all my money on the riskier ones. PM, more MO, ENB, and then IBM cause I feel guilty and I'm getting too much exposed with energy and tabacoo. 

I mean, I don't think I bought crap stocks and making errors right now with my little account it's cheap but I fear my  impulsiveness and the consequences it might have in a future. 

Maybe the fact of having an excel that calculates where will I be financially in 20 years  at X% average yield and Y% avg growth kills me.  Makes playing the game so boring. Specially thinking this in the work, I need to stay here X years more before reaching financial freedom... These  KO JNJ and PG wont make it soon.

t3_gwzhv7,Dividend yield versus dividend payout,"Hi r/dividends,

I've been building a dividend portfolio over the last six months with an ultimate goal of generating $1,000 per month in dividend income, post-withholding tax.

Looking at my recent dividend payments, I've noticed that stocks with lower dividend yields are generating higher dividend amounts per share. For example, $JNJ has a dividend yield of 2.75%, and I received $1.01 per share in June. On the other hand, $EMR has a dividend yield of 3.17%, but I only received $0.50 per share in June.

I understand that dividend yield is a calculation to effectively analyze the health of the dividend and the underlying stock versus its price per share. While that certainly is important, why wouldn't most investors focus on the amount per share? Isn't that what ultimately matters to an income investor, the actual amount that they receive from the underlying stock in dividend payments?

t3_gydhlk,Opinions Wanted on our Dividend Plan,"Hi everyone, 

About a year ago I put together a dividend plan for myself and the significant other with the goal of eventually being able to pay our rent + utilities completely from dividends within 3-4 years. The plan is to eventually buy a house and pay the mortgage with dividends as well. I've been reading r/dividends for a while and I think getting some opinions on our dividend income plan from the community could only make it stronger, so I really appreciate you guys reading through this and poking holes or giving advice.

A little bit about us: We're two young professionals in our mid to late twenties. I make 110,000 +20,000 variable bonus / year, and the partner makes 90,000 + a variable amount of RSUs a year. I am debt free and my partner only has 1600 left on their student loans.  Our rent combined is 1800/month and our utilities are usually 100-200 a month depending on the season (winter heating bills are high).

Basically our total rent + utilities expenses are essentially 2000/month max, or 24,000 a year.

I tried to diversify our dividend plan by industry and weight towards stocks I felt more comfortable with based on their history and price volatility. I assumed that everything we buy will be put on a DRIP for the next 3-4 years so our number of shares that we own should snowball over time. I included some stocks we already owned in the plan (like $AAPL and $ADI) since they do pay some dividend, even though its kind of low. I also tried to include stocks that had cheaper prices (prices lower than 100) so we could buy more shares every month. We're planning on investing 3000-4000 dollars a month in the below plan:

Alright, first time – long time. Many thanks for the knowledge I have gained from following. This is a wonderful community that I appreciate and hope to be able to contribute too thoughtfully in the future.

I am recently divorced and rebuilding my portfolio. TSP/Roth(Fidelity)/Standard IRA(Edward Jones) intact and conservatively invested based on principles from John Bogle and Benjamin Graham or whatever Edward Jones decides…it’s just for the match. I have a Webull account that I use for testing my thoughts and to appease the gambler side that always wants more based on the time I won a trifecta while stationed in Turkey receiving a large duffle bag of hyper-inflated lira; usually the p/l on this account is in the red which is to be expected but it’s for fun.

Back to my point of posting which is the taxable account also through Fidelity. I am building this on a platform of $FXAIX (Fidelity’s S&P 500 Index u/15%), $FREL (Fidelity’s Real Estate ETF@20%) and $FAGIX (Fidelity Capital & Income Fund u/20%) currently making me a 4.09% Yield on Cost or $963 a year. 

From the drop during March, I have also acquired 5 shares of $BRKB (because fuck it it’s Buffett I’ve always wanted it and it gets me %10 off Geico), 10 shares of $GILD (still smh and praying) and 150 shares of $VZ ($T guys sorry but debt and DirectTV; Yahoo was stupid and I agree but 5G).

I am looking for dividends to cover my expenses. I am working my way down annualized bills and allocating the best dividend stocks in the same sector to cover these expenses while forcing myself to become diversified and not just $PG and high yield REITS.

First of all, I'd like to say that these rankings are all based on a 10+ year horizon and don't factor in valuation much.

I'd also like to say that the stocks at the bottom are not trash in my opinion. I own all these holdings but like everyone else, we have ones that we are more excited about than others.

Lastly for those of you that ask why I own so many holdings its mainly because I want my own index fund. Although I love MSFT as a stock I don't want 5% of my money in it with a 32 P/E, this is just one example of why I don't own VOO/SPY. I also think its easier to get motivated when I average 7 dividend payments a week with my profolio.

However lately I’ve been reading around and noticing a lot of suspicion from veteran investors around the integrity of this dividend announcement of 1.40/share ultimately eluding it as misleading and not the true case of what investors in CMCM can expect from their dividend payout. If anyone has any information that they have on my position, or any critiques aswell I am open to listen! Abandoning this play and position seems to be the action I may need to take on Monday as I already have a 10% return I could pull need be when market opens, however I’d hate to obviously incur an “emotional” sale and miss out on 1.40/share on my minimal stake of 2,500 shares because of some phony information.

t3_hbl6b6,Uncovering Covered Calls: A 2 Year Search Of The Best Income Generating ETFs On The TSX,"My attempt at explaining what Covered Call Strategy is, and how it generates higher yields for income investors.

# Enhancing Dividend Yield With Covered Calls

In our 2 year search for the best ETFs on the TSX, we stumbled upon ETFs with covered calls strategy.

We'd research a specific Fund Manager like BMO, check out the fact sheet of an ETF which holds the Major Canadian Banks at a dividend yield of approx. 4.5%. This alone is a quality investment for passive income + growth. Great! End of research, just invest in this and we're good. But then, a couple of more clicks and we see the same Fund Manager (BMO), with a similar ETF holding the same Major Canadian Banks but this one has a dividend yield of approx 7% (ZWB as of June 1st, 2020).  As income investors, this is very interesting..

## How?

ETF ZWB uses a covered call strategy. Before we get into what a covered call strategy is, let's look at why it exists, and why you should include them in your portfolio.

# Why A Need For Covered Calls.

According to Bloomberg reports from March 31st, 2020,  and additional sources: Forbes, MoneyShow, Investopedia

There is a steady decline in available investments that provide dividend yields. This means people are looking for new ways to access money in the marketplace, meaning there is a demand to improve strategies to make money on the stock market by enhancing dividend yields. This strategy offers investors additional income solutions to complement their portfolio and really boost dividend passive income.

# Why Choose Covered Calls? 

* The covered call strategy is used on **Quality Dividend Growers.** These are dividend investments you already want, because of all the good reasons. (large-cap, safe, reliable, blue-chip, dividend payout steadily grows over time) 
* These are the investments you make for the long term and to get rich slowly while collecting income
* The Covered Call strategy **Lowers Volatility** (the action taken in the strategy generates more income for the investor without subjecting investor to added risk)
* The Covered Call Strategy creates **Higher Dividend Yield** (a difference of 2 or 3% is significant for income investors)
* The Covered Call strategy provides **Tax Efficient** income compared to Capital Gains
* The **ETF Management fee** compared to Index ETFs is well worth it for **Income Investors**

# What is a Covered Call?

Covered calls are a very interesting income enhancement strategy because unlike a lot of the other income enhancing strategies out there, (ex: leverage). Covered Call strategy doesn't come with additional risk, in fact, it lowers risk than just holding the securities (stocks) outright. 

**Covered Calls give you more yield without the added risk**

## So What is it?

It's simply holding a basket of stocks (ETF) and then selling call options against some of the stocks in that portfolio (basket). What the Fund Manager does when selling a call option is they choose a price at some point in the future, and by selling that option to a potential buyer, you receive a premium. That premium is the yield enhancement to your overall portfolio.

**Example:** ETF Owner (that's us) owns units of an ETF for 10$ a share Fund Manager of the ETF uses Covered Call StrategyFund Manager sells a Call Option on 100 shares in that ETF

Looks like ThisCall option = For a Premium of 25 cents per share, I will sell you 100 shares at $11 a share **if** the Stock Price goes above $11 within 30 days. (Strike price here is $11)

**Outcome# 1: Stock price goes down after 30 days:**Good for us the owners of the ETF as the Call Option expires worthless and we keep the premium of 25 cents per share ($25 total for this call option)Although you're not too happy the stock price goes down, you just softened the blow because at least you made a commission in the form of that Call Option Premium, plus as a passive income investor, you're glad to just hold on to the stock for the long term anyway.

**Outcome# 2: Stock price stays the same after 30 days:**Good for us as the option expires worthless and we keep the premium again. ($25 for this call option )

**Outcome# 3: Stock price goes up (above the strike price) after 30 days:**In this case: we are obliged to sell the stocks at the strike price, in this case, $11. But make a small profit in doing so as we bought the shares for one price and selling it at a higher price + we get the Call Option Premium. However, this can limit the potential for more upside since the stock can continue to rise (if the stock is above 11$ for example)

## What's the Trade-Off?

You've traded away the excess capital gain of that stock which limits potential growth in exchange for that premium which is the enhanced income. But since ETF manager uses this strategy for large-cap, blue-chip stocks that are stable, the agreed-upon price or strike price has to be higher than the price it was at the time of the Call Option, which isn't too often as the stock is stable. 

In addition, ETF managers use their own proprietary strategy to ensure some upside is captured regardless  (Example: BMO manages to capture about 50% of the upside if the option is exercised)

It sounds confusing, luckily the Fund Managers handle all of this, while we take the **Lazy Person** approach and just sit back and get enhanced income. 

**The Bottom Line:**This strategy is specifically tailored for **Income Investors** who are willing to trade some potential upside gain in the future for more income right now. I hope this helps to clarify was Covered Call Strategy is!",16,1.0,1592508478,"[['BMO', 1]]",EFT,,

When someone buys a call option, they pay a set price called a premium that grants them the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a fixed price (strike price) and sell them for whatever the price is on a fixed date (strike date). 

For example, the current price of BAC is $23.07.  An example call could be a $25c 7/2 for $0.25, meaning the contract holder has the right to buy 100 shares of BAC at $25 each and sell them at whatever price BAC is at on 7/2. Since the contract represent 100 shares, the premium paid is 100 x $0.25= $25. 

So, if BAC reaches $27, the contract holder could buy and sell 100 x (27-25)= $200, but they also paid $25 for the premium so net profit is $175. However, if BAC is only $24 on 7/2 then the call option expires worthless because the strike price was not achieved and the contract holder still loses the premium they paid.

Now, as a dividend investor with 100 shares of BAC myself, I can sell these call options to other people. I pick my own strike price and strike date and submit my 100 shares as collateral for a call option. In return, I get to keep the premium paid no matter what. So if I sell a $27c 7/2 and it expires worthless, I get to keep my shares and the premium the customer paid so I’m +$25 without selling any shares. 

As a dividend investor, your priority is to never sell and keep collecting premiums for as long as possible, so you may want to choose strike prices and strike dates that are very far from the current price in order to ensure that you get to keep your shares. So in reality you might want to sell a $30c 7/2 for only $0.10, but it will likely expire worthless so you still net $10. 

I’ve been selling covered calls on my 400 shares of  BAC and have collected $120 in premiums by selling weekly contracts in just 1 month which I immediately put back into $BAC to buy 4 more shares. My total cost of 400 BAC shares is $10,000, and I yielded 120/10000= 1.2% in premiums within the month.

t3_hiswtq,"Robinhood officially took Chesapeake Energy (CHK) off their app. My thoughts, along with 3 rival companies whose stocks could jump as a result.","After CHK filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy (realigning funding within the company due to debts, from my understanding) their stock froze and, as of this morning, have officially disappeared off the Robinhood platform. 

I find this quite interesting for a number of reasons. First, being from Oklahoma (the state Chesapeake Energy is based in), it brings up questions about where the company will go, if it attempts to continue production after having filed for bankruptcy. The company brought over 2k jobs to the state and the OKC Thunder stadium is currently called Chesapeake Energy Arena. As someone from the state and the presence of a professional sports team still being relatively new, it’s brought the state to a somewhat unprecedented circumstance. Honestly I don’t know what all would happen with all of this. If anyone has seen this occur in your local neighborhood or city, please let me know in the comments, I would be highly interested in reading your thoughts. 

Second, if the company survives and continues production, will it be listed as a penny stock that could be worth buying into as soon as it returns? If it does make a comeback and is extremely cheap, it may be worth dropping like $20 or so into a number of extremely cheap stocks to see if the price surges after investors see the company actually did make a return. Then selling at a higher price, perhaps a much higher price if things go extremely well. CHK being a part of the energy sector, it seems a bit unlikely to me that an energy company would just completely collapse after a single bankruptcy (I’m not an expert on these types of situations, but originally being a local of this company’s market, this brings a unique possibility of positives and negatives in my mind).

Third and final, this could give a boost to a number of other energy companies local to Oklahoma. With homes and businesses relying on this company for energy, other local companies could be sweeping in and increasing their customer base. Some companies include Devon Energy (DVN, which in my mind is probably the most successful energy company in OKC, seeing how their main offices are the lone skyscraper in Oklahoma City. A bit shallow of course, but it’s a prominent figure in the kinds of locals) Continental Resources (CLR), and Sandridge Energy (SD). It will be very interesting to see if any of these companies’ stock values jump if Chesapeake can’t or simply doesn’t make a come back.

t3_hk2pdv,Here's My Spreadsheet for Filtering Div Stocks,"Howdy people. I'm relatively new to dividend investing, and probably like a lot of people around here I've been researching ways to hopefully pick good dividend paying stocks to hold long term.

I'm also a software developer, so I created a Google sheet with a script to fetch data from a couple of APIs, populate some fields, and filter out stocks based on criteria that make sense to me. It also gives me a lint to the Seeking Alpha dividend page for that stock.

It's late here, and I'm sleepy, so take that into consideration when you're reading this! It's turned into quite a long post.

Anyway, the spreadsheet looks like this (this screenshot has the 'filter' sheet missing though):

[All the data is fetched from IEX Cloud and Google Finance \(apart from the tickers themselves\)](https://preview.redd.it/daa8mdskdh851.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b61a30d29bdc77802eac20c19c42dde94f8aeec)

I guess it'd be irresponsible of me not to include the 'bigger-picture' advice, and other things I considered before and during using this to make decisions. My investing plan is basically dividend growth; so long-term holding (20+ years), and I care more about the company's fundamentals, qualitative factors, and dividend and financial history than I do about the stock price on any given day (although I'll definitely by companies I like when they're cheap!). Also, if you're a Brit like me, between 18 and 40, and have similar investing goals to me, then get a Lifetime ISA and put £4,000 in it every year before buying any stocks. The government will give you 25% on top up to £1000 per year. Can't beat guaranteed 25% return on £4k. Unfortunately, I'm British, but not a UK tax resident, so I can't do that. If I could, that's what I'd do before even looking at the stock market.

**EDIT:** Someone from /r/UKInvesting asked about the Lifetime ISA (LISA), and I realised that I forgot to actually say what the Lifetime ISA is good for! (I think I mentioned I was sleepy when I wrote this :) ) A Lifetime ISA gives you a 25% bonus each year (up to £1,000) for you to spend either on your first home, *or* for retirement. You can contribute to a LISA until you're 50, but not withdraw from it for retirement until you're 60. You can withdraw from it any time to help buy a first home. And you can contribute to a LISA and a regular ISA, and even a Help To Buy ISA (if you opened one before they were stopped) in the same tax year, as long as your total ISA contributions don't go over the yearly limit, which is £20,000 for 2020-2021. Lastly, if you have a LISA and a Help to Buy ISA, you can only use one for helping to buy your first home. So long story short, if you're investing for the long-term, I'd say open a LISA and stick your first £4,000 of investment money each year in that...

Anyway, I thought I'd share my spreadsheet and script with the community in the hope that it's useful, and that hopefully people can feed into it and suggest improvements.

[Here's the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_V0ofdoRzCWGZtV8ksuPF85cS8iM-JN9wdGrgQaFBZ8/edit?usp=sharing)

[And here's the script you need](https://pastebin.com/X5P4vBaX)

You'll also need to get one or more API keys from [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/). It's free, and no, I have nothing to do with them. It's probably better to get a few keys by signing up a few times with different email addresses. Otherwise there's a good chance you'll max out your API call quota for a given API key. You only need to confirm the email address, and they'll give you the API key straight after, so don't worry about remembering all the email addresses and passwords you use. Also, don't tell them I told you to do this. ;)

There's a place to put all the API keys at the top of the script. It should be pretty straight forward, just make sure they're all in single or double quotes, and that they're separated by commas.

Once the sheet and script are set up, the workflow I use is pretty speedy to weed out stocks I'm not interested in owning:

* Grab a list of tickers that your broker sells (I'm a Brit so use Trading212 and Freetrade, but I guess most brokers will have a list of the instruments they have available)
* Paste the list of ticker symbols into the sheet (symbols only! Only edit column B of the first sheet)
* Adjust the filter criteria in the second sheet (min dividend, payout ratio range, max P/E ratio, and min EPS)
* From the resulting filtered stocks, follow the Seeking Alpha link of each one to check out more info, like dividend growth over time, dividend news, and financials like total revenue over time.

I can make a rough yes / no decision with this technique in probably about 30 seconds per stock. Maybe I'm missing some important things, so please say if you think this is a stupid idea - I'm here to learn!

If you're not well versed with Google sheets then it might not be totally obvious how to set it all up. I'll run though the basic steps, and then give a more detailed walk through after:

* Copy the sheet linked above so you can edit it.
* Sign up a few times to IEX Cloud and get some API keys
* Go to Tools -> Script Editor
* Paste the code from the second link above into the script. Delete anything that's already in the script (I think there's a default \`myFunction()\` thing - delete that and anything else before pasting my code
* Save the script. You'll probably have to create a new project too - call it whatever you want, doesn't matter.
* Still in the script editor, go to Edit -> Current Project's Triggers
* Click 'Add Trigger' in the bottom right
* Set 'Choose which function to run' to 'getData'
* 'Choose which deployment should run' will be 'Head' (only choice)
* 'Select event source' should be 'From Spreadsheet'
* 'Select event type' should be 'On Edit'
* Then set 'Failure notification settings' to whatever you want. I have mine on daily.
* Click 'Save'.
* You'll have to give permission for the script to interact with your sheet (maybe another coder on here can verify that my code doesn't do anything evil)

That's it! Now you can go to the 'Watch List' sheet, add a ticker into column B, and the script will fill in all the other data. Sometimes it's a little slow, and some data might be missing, but it's mostly there for the good stocks.

Then go to the filter sheet and you'll see a bunch of filtered dividend stocks based on the criteria in the left column. Of course you can edit these to your heart's content!

Then if you want you can click through to Seeking Alpha and see more info, like how long they've been paying dividends for, have their payments been growing, how are their financials etc? In the future I'd like to skip this step and have all that info in the sheet itself as part of the filter. But the APIs I've used don't give me that info (for free, at least), and I don't have much time to dig around for a better solution at the moment.

Anyway, I hope it's useful! I'd love to know what you think!

That's it! Then you can go to the sheet and paste in as many ticker symbols as you like. In theory there shouldn't be a limit, but it gets slow if you paste in more than a few hundred at a time. Just give it some breathing room :)

t3_hl3i8c,Thoughts on FDHY - High Yield Bond ETF,"I’ve lurked on this sub for a while and thought I’d finally ask a question. So I am a long term investor in my 401K and IRA I have a couple of brokerage accounts that I trade options and futures in. So I’m not a total noob.

I had an idea a while back, since even HY savings accounts are crap and really don’t beat or even get close to inflation that I would move my savings to a long term, low risk brokerage account that focused on stable returns, with good dividends to make up about a 5-7% annual return. 

The reason for this was two fold, one I would like my emergency funds and long term savings to make a good return and I don’t need the money instantly. I can wait the 3 days if I need to cash it out. 

So, I set out and did a lot of research and landed on a couple of low fee ETFs. FBND & FDHY - both Fidelity ETFs with a positive NAV over the long term. They both pay monthly dividends. So I started out with FBND and held it for about three months up until the market crash. My thought for going with bond ETF‘s over the actual bond is the liquidity and the ability to exit at any time. My other thought was bonds are much more stable than equities. I found FDHY after the market and crashed and was able to buy and relatively cheap somewhere around $40 per share. It pays about a $.20-$.21 dividend per share per month. And is up already around between 3 and 5% depending on where the market wants to move. 

My second move was to put it in Coca-Cola, so half the portfolio is in Coca-Cola and the other half is in FDHY. Both roughly stabilize around the $40-$50 mark and pay a solid dividend unchanged since it’s open.

Noob question here, im following autodesk (ADSK). Im looking at the financials and slightly confused by one thing. 

The EPS (TTM) is 1.36 and share price is 248.20. So trailing P/E ratio is 248.20/1.36= 182.5 which adds up. 

They already have a value for the forward p/e as 46.

The forward P/E is the, share price divided by the expected earnings per share for the year. So if i add up the eps for the 2020 quarters, q1 is 0.92, q2 is 0.85, q3 is 0.89 (estimated), where is the estimated value of the Q4?  Or where does the estimated eps come from does it come before first quartly report or does it take into account the q1, q2 and then estimates the rest. 

For the forward P/E to be 46, the eps is going to have to go up 5.38 times if share price stays the same. Or do they account for share price increase also. ??

t3_hob4ei,Why the **** is $T so popular?!?,"So I have been involved in this subreddit for a while now and have been able to observe many trends or commonalities in all of your portfolios.  Most of the time you all are doing pretty well, or at least I think so. However, there are a few things that keep popping up in this group that I whole-heartedly disagree with, and today I want to share one with you all and get your opinions.

I’m talking about $T.  $T is probably one of the more common dividend stocks that I’ve seen on here and I just can’t for the life of me understand why.  First off, I’d like to start with some financial ratios and metrics because I’m a financial analyst as my day job (at JPMorgan) and thats what we look at first. Here are some that I’ve pulled out in particular for you all:



$T 



Dividend Yield: 		6.83%

Payout Ratio: 			104.12%

Div. Coverage Ratio: 		96.05%

3yr Div. Growth Rate: 		2.0%

10yr Div. Growth Rate: 		2.1%

Profit Margin (PM):  		8.70%

Cash Flow/Share (TTM): 		$5.99

Current Ratio (CR): 		0.76


So these are just a few that I wanted to pick out and highlight as reasons why I would never suggest investing in $T right now.  First, lets take a look at the Payout Ratio.  Seeing a payout of over 100% is extremely concerning to me right off the bat and this alone would usually keep me from investing.  This payout means its paying out more money in dividends than it’s making as a company.  Next, the Dividend Coverage Ratio, which is almost the opposite formula from the payout ratio.  For $T, the dividend coverage ratio is only 96.05%, which means that its earnings can only cover 96% of the dividends it pays.  This again is extremely concerning.  Next, when we look at the dividend growth rate on paper with no context, 2% and 2.1% is solid. However, when we consider the fact that this growth has overtaken $T’s net income growth, so it is now paying out more than it makes, this is very concerning for the viability of the dividend going forward.

With all of that being said, it is hard for most people to gain insight based purely off of those numbers above with no context, since most people don’t sit in front of a computer looking at company financials and data like I do.  So in order to give you all some context, I have put together the corresponding information for a few of $T’s biggest competitors, namely $VZ and $BCE.



$VZ


Dividend Yield: 		4.44%

Payout Ratio: 			55.06%

Div. Coverage Ratio: 		181.62%

3yr Div. Growth Rate:		2.2%

10yr Div. Growth Rate: 		2.6%

Profit Margin (PM): 		14.4%

Cash Flow/Share (TTM): 		$8.58

Current Ratio (CR): 		0.99




$BCE


Dividend Yield: 		5.99%

Payout Ratio: 			96.05%

Div. Coverage Ratio: 		104.12%

3yr Div. Growth Rate:		5.1%

10yr Div. Growth Rate: 		7.1%

Profit Margin (PM): 		13.36%

Cash Flow/Share (TTM): 		$6.10

Current Ratio (CR): 		0.88


So now that you all have some context on $T’s performance, you can clearly see that, in some of the most important metrics for dividends and profitability, $T is behind 2 of its main competitors.  The only metric/ratio that $T is better in is its dividend yield, which is concerning because its long-term profitability is very much at question and this could greatly jeopardize its dividend going forward.

I believe that a lot of people see that almost 7% dividend and the big, established name of $T and think “It must be safe because they’ve been around a long time and always grow their dividend.”  But a deeper look into their financials shows that this is not the case at all.

So I want to pose the question to you all: Now that you have seen this, what are your thoughts on $T?  Will you still invest in it?  Will you sell your current shares?  Will you conduct further research on your own?  All opinions are welcome and I’d love to hear whatever you have to say.",145,0.9400000000000001,1594328058,"[['T', 6]]",EFT,,

>Bristol Myers Squibb Co. ($BMY)

On paper, this company is doing well.  Solid revenue growth.  Unfortunately, this is dramatically overshadowed by the faults in the dividend.  Healthcare is a very fragile industry.  This is reflected in $BMY's net income, which fluctuates massively from year to year. Profits can evaporate on a dime, which is why companies need to keep a very close eye on their dividends and payout ratios, lest they take on debt they cannot afford. $BMY does not seem to understand this principle.  In 2015, their payout ratio was 158.27%.  In 2017 their payout ratio was 255.91%.  As of Q2 2020, their trailing twelve month payout ratio is a whopping 317.30%.  Considering that revenue and the gross profit margin have grown every single year since 2015, a picture begins to paint itself of what is happening.

I understand trying to maintain one's dividend, but it has to be done sustainably.  This company is listing itself as having around $50 billion in debt.  With a debt to equity ratio of 96%, this company has a higher ratio than AT&T!  This is incredibly dangerous, and the board does not seem to care.  A 40% D/E ratio is considered high.  96% is stratospheric and growing.

From my outsider perspective, it looks like a hard dividend cut is in this company's future.  The dividend is rising faster than profits, executive compensation is way higher than industry averages for a company of this size, shareholders are being diluted.  This company is setting course for either bankruptcy court or a dividend cut.  Considering the underlying revenue and gross profit margins of the company are strong, the latter option seems more likely.

There are many facets of the healthcare industry.  Among them, drug distribution is not the place you want to be right now.   AmerisourceBergen is currently being sued by every state and their mother right now due to the company's role in the opioid epidemic currently plaguing rural America.  I could sit here all day and explain the horrible actions this company took, but if people care about that, they can read the lawsuits.  Let's talk about the numbers.

Over the past five years, revenue has grown by around $40 billion, but the company's profit has remained stagnant at around $1billion.  In 2019, the company generated around $180 billion in revenue.  The company turned that $180 billion into 855 million in profit.  To put that in perspective, $ABC has a net profit margin of 0.47%.  That margin is not small, it is not tiny, it could barely even be called razor thin.  The most accurate term would be microscopic.

I like how insiders hold a very sizable portion of the company, but the amount of shareholder dilution is concerning.

This company seems more focused on its dividend than actually growing its business.  If we were talking about a utility, that would be fine.  Unfortunately, this is a company with two massive competitors (Visa and Mastercard) who would prefer their industry to remain a duopoly.  When you are a small player challenging not one, but two fin-tech giants, growth should be a priority, especially since V and MA still consider themselves growth companies, hence why their payout ratios are so low.

>Wells Fargo

I've made the case against Wells Fargo before, so I won't make myself out to be a broken record on the subject, but long story short, I would not consider buying into this stock until the entire board has been replaced.  This company has been mismanaged for years at this point and has nothing to show for it.  Interest revenue has grown by over $15 billion in the past five years, but the company has shed about $3 billion in net interest profits over the same time.  Based upon the data, it seems that Wells Fargo was taking on higher risk revenue streams.  This is reflected in the soaring interest revenue on loans and borrowings the company collected, but the decline in non-interest revenue.  These and other data points paint a picture that suggests clients who are in a less financially secure position were getting larger loans at higher interest rates. It works only as long as your clients are employed.  


Then we have the lawsuits and the fraud, which brought down consumer interest in the bank.  New customer signups dropped off a cliff.  To cover up this shortfall and prevent the dividend from coming under pressure, the company ramped up its share buybacks.  This is why the company's stock price stagnated.  Not because they were doing anything innovative to make the stock worth holding, they simply just began buying back shares.  

In the part of the country where I live, Wells Fargo used to be seen as the definitive place to get your mortgage.  The local branch was willing to match any other bank's offer.   Looking at mortgage revenue today, we see it cut by 2/3rds over the past five years.  All of this can be combined and you can see why the dividend was forced to be cut.  All of this was entirely preventable.  

Is the company in a better state now than in 2009?  Honestly hard to say.  The damage is that bad.  You could be a billionaire on paper, but if you are only a billionaire because you own 1 billion $1 coffee mugs, then your wealth doesn't really mean anything.  If all your clients will declare bankruptcy the second the stimulus money runs out, you will be in for a wild ride.

>McDonald's

In my personal opinion, speaking as a manager at Cracker Barrel, franchising is a horrible and outdated business model.  To sum up the problem with franchises in one word, it would be ""loyalty,"" more specifically the lack of it.  Everyone involved in a franchise operation is out to make money, end of story.   Any manager on Earth will tell you that when employees do not care about their job, the entire business suffers.  I have yet to meet an individual who works at a franchise who actually cares about their job.  

In contrast, my employer Cracker Barrel refuses to franchise.  It is the second largest publicly traded restaurant company in the United States that does not franchise (second only to Chipotle).  The only thing stopping this company is the number of stores.  Cracker Barrel isn't even in all fifty states yet.  The company chooses to expand slowly and methodically.  There is a dedicated team of employees whose sole purpose is to open stores.  These employees (called 'red shirts') are hand picked from stores around the country and work collectively to make sure every new store opening is as smooth as possible.  Each and every one of them cares deeply about this company.  The vast majority of our employees care about this company.

I cannot tell you how many people start out working for us just as a summer or part time job, but then simply fall in love with this company and end up working here for their entire careers.  This company is legendary in the restaurant and retail industries for its retention rates.  We have employees and managers that have been with this company for decades.  Of course, most employees come and go.  College students who wait tables to pay for their degrees, hosts who simply need a summer job before their senior year of high school.  But every single store has its core.  The PAR IVs who are in this for the long haul.  They are the cornerstone of every store, and they work together like a well oiled machine.  The best servers in my store make over $50,000 a year, when the average check size is around $11.

This loyalty goes both ways. When the pandemic hit, corporate refused to lay anyone off and instead took out debt to give every employee two weeks of retention pay and to maintain manger's salaries.  The only people who got laid off were 22 District managers and 2 Regional Vice Presidents.  They were offered severance in exchange for early retirement.  Cracker Barrel took advantage of the pandemic to clean up its corporate structure and internal logistics network, and it paid off.  Last week, my store (restaurant+retail) made $90,000 in sales, because all our experienced employees never left.   

Speaking of corporate structure, another disadvantage of the franchise model.  Internal promotion is impossible.  No company would promote a franchise owner to be an executive.  However, when everyone already works for the company, internal promotion can become the default.  When a company internally promotes its best and brightest, you keep that talent inside the company.  It is physically impossible for someone who works outside Cracker Barrel to be hired as a District manager or Regional Vice President.  This company has found that external hires simply cannot compare to those internally promoted.  Managers undergo weeks of training at the company's headquarters in Lebanon, Tennessee, and the majority of external hires just can't handle it and drop out.  In fact, pretty much everyone at Home Office was internally promoted and used to work in a store.  It all comes back to actually caring about your job and the company you work for.

I could go on all day, but the numbers speak for themselves.  The average McDonald's generates roughly $1.1 million in revenue.  The average Cracker Barrel generates over $4.5 million per year.  I often get asked sarcastically if people actually buy the products we sell in retail.  The answer is yes.  If people do not want it, we do not sell it.  Retail makes up 20% of Cracker Barrel's total revenue.  In my store alone, my 20 employees (2 full time shift leaders, 3 full time, 13 part time, and 2 seasonal) we alone generate more revenue than the average McDonald's, and we are not even the largest store in our district (though granted we are an above average store).  I'm not allowed to give exact figures, but let's just say my manager bonus last year was very nice, and I reward my people.

To get back to McDonald's, its franchising is a hindrance to its own success.  Stores compete with each other, instead of working together.  This brings down the entire company, and we see falling revenue year over year.  This company has no real room to grow.  McDonald's has built a reputation for being dirty, unhealthy, and greedy. Unless the company can fix itself, it will be nothing but downhill.  

Recommended Replacement: Cracker Barrel.  Sadaar Biglari's idiotic war against the board has kept this company's share price stagnant for the past few years.  He ran steak n shake into the ground, and has been trying to force himself on CBRLs board since 2012.  In the process, he's nearly bankrupted his own company, while Cracker Barrel has continued to grow and thrive.   Once Biglari bankrupts himself into irrelevance, the stock price will begin growing again.

>Best Buy

I think Best Buy needs to make some significant course corrections to prevent going the way of other retailers.  This pandemic is likely to single-handedly kill the concept of Black Friday and holiday shopping in person, which is where Best Buy makes about half of their net income for the year.  The business model of making all your profit in Q4 is not going to work in the 21st century.  Retailers like Target are successful because they make decent money year round, with the holidays simply being a bonus.  The company does not need the holidays to make a profit for the year.  

This is what the people who forecast the death of retail do not realize.  The kind of retail where you do all your business between October and December is going to die.  The kind of retail where all revenue is dispersed evenly, with smaller spikes in Q2 or Q4, that is what will generate the most returns.

t3_hqgm9b,$AGM aka Farmer Mac Stock Analysis,"&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**

**1) Who/What is Farmer Mac?**

Farmer Mac - hereon referred to as AGM for the sake of abbreviation - is to the agricultural industry what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are to the home mortgage industry. For those unfamiliar, all three are considered **GSE's** (**Government-Sponsored Enterprises)**. 

2) **What does a GSE do?**

Basically GSE's act as secondary markets for mortgages and loans. In the primary market, a primary lender writes up a mortgage. This mortgage (or an asset of these mortgages) can then be sold to a secondary lender. The reason why these secondary lenders exist is because they are able to reduce the cost of capital on these mortgages/loans, making them more accessible to the general population.

In essence, a GSE like Farmer Mac improves access to credit. 

&#x200B;

3) **But wait, doesn't that mean GSE's take on toxic mortgage assets?**

In general, yes. 

But there's a catch. Both the primary lenders that AGM purchases the bulk of these agriculture loans/assets from (the **Farm Credit System**) as well as AGM itself are both regulated by the **Farm Credit Association.** 

The Farm Credit Association is an independent agency of the federal government which exists to regulate the financial institutions that provide credit to farmers.

In light of the Great Recession, the farm credit association has made tremendous leaps in ensuring only the most conservative underwriting measures to reduce the risk of default on these loans.

&#x200B;

**FINANCIALS**

&#x200B;

Now, here's the juicy part and why I think this is such a good investment. All this info is copy-pasted straight from their Q1 update:

* Provided $1.3 billion in liquidity and lending capacity in first quarter 2020, resulting in net outstanding business volume growth of $421.4 million; 
*  Net income attributable to common stockholders was $9.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share; 
* • Core earnings, a non-GAAP measure was $20.1 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share; 
* • Net interest income grew $0.7 million year-over-year to $41.3 million; 
* • Net effective spread, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14% from the prior-year period to $44.2 million; 
* **• 90-day delinquencies were 0.37% of total outstanding business volume as of March 31, 2020**
*  **First quarter provision for credit losses of $3.8 million, largely driven by expected COVID-19 impact.** 

Look at that provision for credit loss. It's only $3.8 million.That's **0.09%** of their outstanding business volume. That's nothing at all. This means they don't expect to face significant losses on their assets.

&#x200B;

**Dividend**

&#x200B;

* AGM has a near 5% dividend yield with a payout ratio of \~35%
* AGM recently raised the dividend from 0.70 per quarter to 0.80 per quarter

**LONG TERM OUTLOOK**

&#x200B;

* U.S. government won't allow farmers to suffer tremendous losses on their loans. Agriculture is a heavily subsidized industry and massive losses on agricultural mortgages and loans would be a huge detriment to the U.S.",2,1.0,1594651867,"[['AGM', 6]]",EFT,,

&#x200B;

So obviously no portfolio is ""perfect"" but I recently got into investing in January and have been playing around trying to design a ""perfect"" portfolio for myself. I want to focus on dividends for passive income but also have growth because I am young. 

&#x200B;

After 6 months of absorbing everything I could and learning what I could (again, I'm no expert so any and all input is greatly appreciated), I came up with this portfolio:

$PFE, $JNJ, $MDT

$KO, $PEP, $MCD, $DIS

$D, $PPL, $NEE

$RTX, $MMM, $HD

$MSFT, $V, $AVGO

$C, $TD, $JPM

$T, $VZ

$WMT, $WM, $CMCSA

&#x200B;

I ran this portfolio through [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/) to backtest it. I gave all holdings equal weight. I started with a $10k investment with a recurring 6k investment each year. Since $AVGO started in 2009, it only tracked since then and it beat SPY by $1,000 or so. I removed $AVGO and $V since they started around the same time and I wanted more years. Removing those two, it allowed a backtest to 1996 where it beat SPY by a whopping [168k](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

&#x200B;

I chose a $6000 per year recurring investment because that's a pretty standard $500 per month and the same amount I contribute to my Roth IRA each year.

&#x200B;

Next I threw the portfolio (minus $V and $AVGO) into this [program](https://trackyourdividends.com/) and equally weighted the shares of each stock to $100. The total yield of the portfolio came out to 3.32%. This would obviously fluctuate based on the weight of the holdings but with all assets being equal I thought this was pretty good (seeing as 4% is the goal from what I've seen).

&#x200B;

I think this is a great portfolio personally and will probably be the one I strive for little by little (only have about 7k in RH right now). I also like ETFs and will be allotting money for $VIG, $SPHD, $SPYD, and $JEPI. If $JEPI performs well for a while, I will split my funds from $SPHD and $SPYD equally into $JEPI and $VIG.

First of all, thank you for your time and attention! I've been heavily investing the last year and have dabbled in common stocks with a growth strategy as well as day trading with options. As I'm trying to set up for my future, I've been researching and diving into Dividends more. 

My ultimate goal is to supplement my current growth portfolio with a dividend paying one for the future and be able to pass this along to my children as well. 

I am using M1 finance for my dividend portfolio since it takes out the guesswork and allows fractional shares. I would like some feedback and critique on my portfolio. I'm looking for high yield but also stability on these. I'm in my 30s so I currently have pretty high tolerance for risk. I think that's what got me interested in QYLD. 

This is weighted by % in my portfolio

* O - Reality Income Corp - 15%
* SPHD - S&P 500 High Dividend - 13%
* QYLD - NASDAQ Covered Calls ETF - 10%
* VZ - Verizon - 10%
* T - AT&T - 9%
* MMP - Magellan Midstream - 8%
* PRU - Prudential Financial - 7%
* BNS - Bank of Nova Scotia - 5%
* MMM - 3M - 5%
* XOM - Exxon Mobile
* BEP - Brookfield Renewable Partners - 2%
* VYM - Vanguard High Yield - target 5%

So before anyone starts typing JNJ or KO, I work in a regulatory agency where I'm not allowed to have holdings in those type of consumer goods and medical/pharm stuff. I believe that includes ETFs in those sectors too.

t3_hupjt3,"What is your opinion re: REITs, specifically office REITs?","So I invest in the Australian market (slowly educating myself about the American) and I can see that a lot of RE stocks have not bounced back the way that other stocks have. Now that makes some sense to me, due to the current threats/climate. However, this has left many REITs with attractive valuations and attractive dividends. 
Office REITs in particular seem to have the best valuations. Now I understand that due to working from home and other COVID related impacts, have brought in to questions the value of office space. Lots of companies have stated that they will continue the working from home trend, even after COVID ends due to the saved costs. 
However, I think this impact is overestimated. Lots of companies rely heavily on collaboration and collaboration that just works better face to face. Yes people can connect via zoom, teams etc but it’s just not the same. Also a few company managers have stated that they feels that the lower levels of control, communication and team mindset has a worse affect on productivity than the saved costs of working from home. 
So as I see it, there is a great chance a lot of companies will return to office space when this is all said and done. 
Assuming the REIT you look at is in great shape, great occupancy rates and quality tenants, they seem like a sound investment.

My dividend portfolio consists of 16 paying individual stocks, CEFs, ETFs, ETNs, BDCs and REITs.

Holdings: [https://imgur.com/a/caZW3ki](https://imgur.com/a/caZW3ki) 

The portfolio is in a taxable brokerage with the sole purpose of providing income in early retirement. I am mostly concerned with preservation of my money. I don't want any or very little ROC (Return of Capital) and I'm not chasing massive gains here, at least in this account. I have additional IRAs, SEP IRAs, Roth IRAs, HSAs and 401ks that I am going after the growth plays in.

I'm currently in my late 30s and have plans to retire by the time I am 48. A goal of mine was to build enough to pay the mortgage, and we did that and paid our mortgage off in March of 2019. So now, we are 100% debt free and all extra cash flow is being reinvested. My employer has a stock purchase plan and I get a 10% discount on the lowest price of the stock in the quarter, so I max out that benefit and after the holding period, I roll over the proceeds to this brokerage account and rinse and repeat. While I like our company, I don't want to have too much tied to the future of my employer.

The long term goal is to have no debt, own a house outright (these first two are both done) and generate at least 65k/yr or more in dividend yield from this account in order to FIRE. I don't use DRIP as everything now is commission free and I want to have a little more direction in what the income goes into and buy on down days. Currently the average monthly income is $1,590.13 in this account.

This account is used solely as a bridge from the time I decide to FIRE and when I can start drawing on my 401ks, IRAs, SEP IRAs, etc. which I have maxed out throughout my working years. Sure, it's a tax drag, but if you want to retire early, you need to be able to cover that bridge and not just pump into your retirement plans. In addition to the holdings below, I also have \~100k across long term growth buys that do not pay dividends in this account. They include $BKNG, $OKTA, $LYV, $LOVE. The plan is to hold them for an unknown amount of time, when I'm happy with the profit, convert them into more dividend payers. I'm getting very close to selling $LOVE as I bought in around $7 and have a nice gain thus far.

I recently added two new dividend paying positions ($JEPI, and $REML) as well, but those are not in my list for two reasons. $JEPI is too new to calculate a long term yield estimate using the TD Ameritrade ""Income Estimator"" tool and I see $REML as a 100% gamble. The dividend yield for $REML is stupid high, currently TD Ameritrade estimates a 77% payout as a mortgage REIT. It was over 100% at one point recently, obviously that is not sustainable and that Income Estimator tool uses that number to calculate future yield. It crashed massively due to COVID back in March and if it recovers will be a slow recovery. I'm not sold on that fact that it will ever recover to that same level. Maybe. Maybe not. It's highly volatile and leveraged. If you can't stomach a loss, DO NOT get into it. If everyone is able to make their mortgage payments throughout this pandemic, there's a ton of upside, if we crash even further, it's likely $REML will be worth $0. I'm ok with this risk. The fat monthly payout and even fatter quarterly payout is nice. Again, total gamble.

The list of stocks below gets me an average yield of 7.29%. The cost basis is $261,616.39 and yields me $19,081.57 without the two listed stocks that I took out of it. See the image I attached for how mush weight I have across them. I'm definitely over 20k per year with those other two above added in. For now, I just keep growing my positions to get me closer to that 65k/yr!

Have a good weekend everyone.

t3_hwvpug,Reflecting on my own personal portfolio for Q2 2020 (Portfolio Review?),"For the past several years in my dividend investment journey, every three months I take a day off and dedicate the entire day to my portfolio.  My wife calls it my ""Excel Day,"" since all she really sees me doing is modifying my Excel spreadsheet.

Today was that day for Q2 of 2020 (April 2020 through June 2020).  Normally I would just keep this information to my wife and I, but since people seem to really like me reviewing other people's portfolios, I figured it would be kinda interesting to see other people's thoughts on how I view my own portfolio.  

The other reason I am posting this is because whenever I do a portfolio review, I always link to my own personal portfolio.  According to my brokerage M1, multiple people have clicked the link to ""invest in this pie,"" and have put real money into mirroring my personal portfolio.   I feel like I owe it to those individuals to inform them of how I am modifying my portfolio based upon the past three months of what I have seen in the markets.  Let them know what I am selling, buying more of, etc.  With that being, said, I guess this is the part where I review my own portfolio.  

&#x200B;

I won't bore you with where I went to research and how I went about researching the activities of the various companies in my portfolio.  I already tend to keep a close eye on most of them, so it was just a matter of checking in on the companies that do not tend to make headlines every day.  I then open up Seeking Alpha and look at the numbers of the companies I am invested in and simply focus on absorbing data, taking a few notes when appropriate.  Once my research is complete, I eat lunch to clear my head.  I then head back to my desk and make some decisions.

The first decision is what companies (if any) should I sell out of.  Going into today, I already had companies on the metaphorical chopping block.  Those were: $MMM, $MAIN, $FTAI, $LLY, and $CVS.  It is important to note here why a company can be put on my portfolio's chopping block.  I am always comparing the companies in my portfolio to each other.  Me selling out of a company does not necessarily mean the company is bad, rather that the company may not be completely aligned with my goals as an investor, or that the company is making a series of moves that I personally am opposed to.  I will never sell on a whim.  A company must remain on the chopping block for at least an entire quarter before I allow myself to sell out completely.  This is to prevent me from making impulse decisions.

After looking at the research, I determined that I would sell out of $MMM, $LLY, and $CVS.  Let me explain my reasoning below:

**$MMM**. Looking at this company over the past five years, all I really see is stagnation.  While the dividend is still increasing year over year faster than inflation, virtually every other metric used to analyze a company has remained stagnant.  Net Income for 2019 was actually lower than in 2015.  Stagnant revenue and profits coupled with an increasing dividend equals an increasing payout ratio.  3M is no exception to this rule, seeing a payout ratio rise from 52.99% in 2015 to 72.56% in 2019.  If this continues at this rate, the payout ratio could easily rise to over 90% or even over 100% by 2029.  Considering I am of the ""buy and hold forever"" mindset, this would not be good and could potentially result in a dividend cut several years into the future.  Combine all this with a stagnant share price, and I see 3M serving more as a future drag on my portfolio heading into the 2020s and beyond.

**$LLY.** I will begin by saying I am not an expert in the healthcare space.  I sold out of this company because I have a philosophy that no matter how good a stock looks, I will only invest in what I can understand.  I cannot analyze that which I do not understand.  When I bought this company, I believed I would try to work more on learning how the healthcare industry works so I could perform more detailed analyses on healthcare companies, but unfortunately I am just as stuck as I was before.  My wife works for the government as a translator, so we use her health insurance.  She understands the American healthcare nightmare more than I do, so she handles that aspect of our lives.  This company may be the most undervalued company on Earth, but I simply cannot own something I know nothing about.  Technically, I could project this onto every company in my healthcare pie, but I recognize that I need exposure to the space to have a diversified portfolio, so I always try to tread very carefully when messing with the companies in my healthcare pie.  

**$CVS.** I used to recommend this company to people interested in healthcare stocks, but its performance over the past five years has changed my mind.  The stock has been trending nothing but downwards after peaking in late July 2015, with the dividend stagnation only adding to the downward trend.  Compared to my other healthcare stocks, this one is just not keeping up, so I have cut it out.  

&#x200B;

Now to explain why I did not sell out of the other companies on the chopping block from last quarter.

**$MAIN.** This company is about nothing except the dividend to me.  Today the company announced that it was profitable for the second quarter of 2020, which is becoming rarer and rarer in 2020, so good on them for that.  The monthly dividends are a huge draw, and as long as management keeps paying them, I am here for them.  However, if the payout ratio stays too high, I will likely sell, as I prefer sustainable dividends over the long term.

**$FTAI.** This is a company that I bought years ago at such a low price that I can't bring myself to sell.  Including dividends, my ROI on this company is sitting at around 511.32% over the past few years.  I hate the stagnant dividend, but every time I think about selling, I just cannot bring myself to do it. It's been losing money for years, but just started turning a profit in 2019.  If anyone can give me one or more good reasons to finally ditch this company, I am all ears.  Especially interested in what I should replace it with.  I want the dividends in my portfolio to grow over time and compound.  A stagnant fixed dividend runs counter to that goal.

&#x200B;

Looking over the data for Q2, I have added the following companies to my metaphorical chopping block:

**$EL.** The shutdowns have really hurt this company.  Even though I tell my wife every day that she is beautiful and does not need makeup, she still uses this company's products on a daily basis.  I bought this company purely because she uses their products, and I wanted to make sure we were profiting off her desire to wear makeup and the other female beauty products that currently sit on my bathroom counter and I have no idea what they are (What is a setting spray?  Should I even care?)  According to my wife, this company owns many valuable brands and is a solid investment in female beauty.  She talked to me about this company for about thirty minutes regarding the different products, and I did not understand any of it.  I got that they made nail polish.  I know what that is because I have a sister who was once a teenager, but other than that I am flying blind here.  If there are any individuals in this subreddit with knowledge of the beauty community, perhaps I can get their opinions on if this stock is worth it for the long term.

So going into Q3 of 2020, I think my portfolio is looking very strong.  For those who are interested, [here is the link to my portfolio as it stands now](https://m1.finance/5pfRVMQqi84h), adjusted for what I have mentioned above.  Every company in my portfolio is likely to pay their Q3 dividend on time.  The only suspensions I have in this portfolio are $EL and $DIS.  I have already seen Kroger, Brookfield Renewable Partners, and Canadian National Railway announce dividend increases for this quarter's payments.  

As for the company I am most bullish on for Q3 2020, it would have to be Cracker Barrel.  As a manager for the company, I have an insider perspective, and that perspective is telling me that this company could have turned a profit during Q2, but chose not to (based on my back of the envelope calculations).  During the closures, we were limited to only Togo service.  It would have been very easy to just sit idly by and wait out the closures and preserve cash.  Just let all the hourly employees go and keep a skeleton crew.  However, management chose a different strategy.  When the world shut down, Cracker Barrel's executives got together in a closed door meeting and decided on the following things:

1. Provide retention pay to **all** hourly employees so they can survive the quarantine. The amount of retention pay was determined based upon how long the employee had been with the company.
2. All employees were given the ability to buy food from the restaurant at the price Cracker Barrel paid for it.  By doing this, employees got to fill up the their refrigerators without having to go to a grocery store and potentially get infected and they got good food dirt cheap.
3. All employees who had been with the company long enough got 1 free meal per day through the shutdowns.  That way those employees could conserve cash more easily by cutting their food budget by \~33%.  
4. The company made sure nobody lost healthcare by essentially paying for everyone's premiums through the shutdowns.
5. Normally employees get a 35% discount on everything.  However, to help employees conserve money, the discount was raised to 50% for the duration of the shutdowns.  Considering we do sell quite a bit of food in retail, this was well received by employees.  
6. All executives were required to take a minimum 50% pay reduction for 2020.  Some executives chose a near 100% pay reduction to help the company preserve cash.  
7. The company gave 2 Regional Vice Presidents and 22 District Managers the ""option"" of early retirement.  Severance and all that jazz.  The head of Restaurant and Retail Operations then got together and redrew all the district and regional boundaries to slim down the corporate structure.  This will save the company a lot of money in the next several years by trimming down the bureaucracy.
8. There were a few other things the company did that I do not know if I am allowed to mention, so I will not mention them because I do not want to have that conversation with my superiors.

The question outsiders may have is ""Why would a restaurant company do this?""  The answer is pretty simple actually.  Loyalty.  The restaurant business is infamous for extremely high turnover, but the loyalty of Cracker Barrel is legendary in the industry.  You have employees in every job code who have been with the company for years or even decades.  I know servers, grill cooks, dishwashers, retail associates, and maintenance workers who have worked for this company for decades.  I myself have worked for the company since I was 17, and plan to work here until I retire.  The company is very good to its employees, mainly because the company has a culture of internal promotion.  With the exception of the CEO and Chief Legal Officer, the executives who decided how this company was going to handle the pandemic were themselves internally promoted through the corporate hierarchy to reach their current positions.  This is likely why no Cracker Barrel has actually ever tried to unionize.  Those who are running this operation know what it is like to work for the company.  These are the benefits of refusing to franchise.  You keep your best and brightest inside the company, and move them up the ladder as they improve.  Combine the above with a loyal customer base, and you have a borderline recession-proof company. 

I could honestly dedicate an entire thread to why I feel the company is undervalued, but I do not want to cross the line between education and flattery.  When you look at things objectively, the stock is undervalued by quite a lot.  It is almost completely due to the meddling of Biglari Capital Corp and its CEO Sadar Biglari.  For the past nine years Biglari has tried to insert himself onto the company's board.  He has essentially run his company into near bankruptcy trying to wage war on management.  It is actually really sad honestly.  [This letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000092189513001908/ex991to13da2507428021_091713.htm) filed with the SEC was passed around the company back when it was first released.  It reads like an angry manchild wrote it.  

Alas, Biglari has driven his company nearly to the point of bankruptcy trying to fight Cracker Barrel.  Once Biglari is out of the picture, the stock will begin rising once again.",66,0.98,1595567109,"[['EL', 1]]",EFT,,

The reason I am doing it is to build a small stream of passive income.  I haven't thought too heavily about long term goals, but wanted to make small contributions to it over time.

t3_hxp0pa,Over-Diversification and Dividends,"A sentiment I've heard a few times on this sub and others is that over-diversification can be bad. To my understanding, this is because investing in too many stocks/ETFs/mutual funds limits your potential to beat the market and makes your portfolio harder to manage. 

This makes sense to me when talking about stock price growth, but does this also apply to dividend growth? Dividends are much more explicit, as you can all but guarantee a steadily increasing dividend from many stocks. Furthermore, the point of dividend investing seems to be seeking a solid near-guaranteed return, which to me seems to imply that you can never have too much diversification.

t3_i0l89f,Selecting An ETF / REIT Based Off of Age,"Question: 

If you are in your early 20’s, would it be more beneficial to hold high yielding ETFs / REITs such as SPHD, VYM, SPYD, O etc. in a non tax leveraged account, and hold growth ETFs such as VIG, VTI, VXUS, VOO, etc. in a 401k/IRA? 

At the moment, I’m stuck between buying a couple thousand dollars of SPHD, VYM, or O. 

I used a DRIP calculator and calculated between the years 2015-2019 (Pre-Corona to get somewhat clearer results) and found that SPHD and VYM are similar. The higher dividend yield from SPHD made up for the minimal growth rate in the price of the ETF, while VYM’s price growth allowed it to keep up, and in some cases, be slightly ahead of SPHD.  

I also calculated for 2015-2020 post-March to see what unstable conditions would do, and here, VYM out performed SPHD by a couple thousand. But, I’m being optimistic and hoping that for the next 5 years, nothing like this happens again. 

I also ran the DRIP calculator on O (Realty Income Corp) Vs. SPHD and VYM and I don’t know what to really think of the results. O’s graph was quite messy compared to the ETFs, but that’s expected considering it’s that O is one sector rather than a diversified ETF. Yet, even post March, it is outperforming both SPHD and VYM. The only thing outperforming all of these was VIG, by one or two thousand dollars by the end of years 2019/2020. 

So, between VYM, SPHD, and O, I’m thinking of picking a combination of SPHD and O to grow my position over the next few years. I’m a huge fan of the monthly dividend idea and O looks to be a very solid REIT for me. I would just like to know, would VIG be a better choice at my age to hold in Robinhood, or should I put it into a Roth IRA with VTI, VXUS, etc.. the lower yielding, higher growth ETFs, and just hold the higher yielding moderate growth ETFs/REITs in my Robinhood?",2,1.0,1596112348,"[['O', 5]]",EFT,,

 - $NAT published Q2 and first half 2020 results, and has shown outstanding growth to net income, EBITDA and net revenue.

 - The supply and demand shocks that occurred in May created a super contango, which caused freight rates to soar as floating storage interest spiked.

 - Uncertainties for 2020 and 2021 still remain, and could show oil recovery to come in below estimates if travel fails to recover as expected with second waves possible.

 - TCE (Time Charter Equivalent) growth is substantial and six times the operating expenses per day, giving $NAT a lot of room to still capitalize even if TCE falls.

 - There is higher-than-average short interest since May, put/call ratio is currently 0.2, yet shares have hardly moved in the past several months.


Tl;dr: Nordic does present an opportunity, albeit with high risk, but with a measure of relative safety due to its current $.20 dividend, offering a forward yield of 17.7%; however, long-term prospects do look quite muted, a triple-digit upside looks very out-of-the-picture.

What is your opinion on NWN? 

It's a natural gas and water company (green energy is always good). 

It's current price is \`53\`+- (Lost 32% in the past 6 Months).

It has a Nice Div data (P/E is a bit high for me, but i guess it is because of the income lost).

The thing is that the sector is good, before the COVID-19 situation the company's status was very good. Except for the share price (big drop) I don't see any issues with it.

t3_ihm0o2,$AGM aka Farmer Mac DD," 

# $AGM aka Farmer Mac Stock Analysis

**BACKGROUND**

**1) Who/What is Farmer Mac?**

Farmer Mac - hereon referred to as AGM for the sake of abbreviation - is to the agricultural industry what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are to the home mortgage industry. For those unfamiliar, all three are considered **GSE's** (**Government-Sponsored Enterprises)**.

2) **What does a GSE do?**

Basically GSE's act as secondary markets for mortgages and loans. In the primary market, a primary lender writes up a mortgage. This mortgage (or an asset of these mortgages) can then be sold to a secondary lender. The reason why these secondary lenders exist is because they are able to reduce the cost of capital on these mortgages/loans, making them more accessible to the general population.

In essence, a GSE like Farmer Mac improves access to credit.

3) **But wait, doesn't that mean GSE's take on toxic mortgage assets?**

In general, yes.

But there's a catch. Both the primary lenders that AGM purchases the bulk of these agriculture loans/assets from (the **Farm Credit System**) as well as AGM itself are both regulated by the **Farm Credit Association.**

The Farm Credit Association is an independent agency of the federal government which exists to regulate the financial institutions that provide credit to farmers.

In light of the Great Recession, the farm credit association has made tremendous leaps in ensuring **only the most conservative underwriting measures** to reduce the risk of default on these loans.

**FINANCIALS**

Now, here's the juicy part and why I think this is such a good investment. All this info is copy-pasted straight from their Q1 update:

* Provided $1.3 billion in liquidity and lending capacity in first quarter 2020, resulting in net outstanding business volume growth of $421.4 million;
* Net income attributable to common stockholders was $9.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share;
* • Core earnings, a non-GAAP measure was $20.1 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share;
* • Net interest income grew $0.7 million year-over-year to $41.3 million;
* • Net effective spread, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14% from the prior-year period to $44.2 million;
* **• 90-day delinquencies were 0.37% of total outstanding business volume as of March 31, 2020**
* **First quarter provision for credit losses of $3.8 million, largely driven by expected COVID-19 impact.**

Look at that provision for credit loss. It's only $3.8 million.That's **0.09%** of their outstanding business volume. That's nothing at all. This means they don't expect to face significant losses on their assets.

**Dividend**

* AGM has a near 5% dividend yield with a payout ratio of \~35%
* AGM recently raised the dividend from 0.70 per quarter to 0.80 per quarter

**LONG TERM OUTLOOK**

* U.S. government won't allow farmers to suffer tremendous losses on their loans. Agriculture is a heavily subsidized industry and massive losses on agricultural mortgages and loans would be a huge detriment to the U.S.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Dividend yield is nearly 5% with very low payout ratio (\~35%). The loans serviced are in the agriculture industry which is as safe as it gets (government won't let farmers fail to make payments on their loans). Revenue has been steadily increasing over time. Low interest rate environment provides good time to get in on this stock as income on interest spread can only get better over time.",9,1.0,1598538557,"[['AGM', 7]]",EFT,,

t3_iiee7s,r/dividends is hiring mods! (Plus some very important announcements),"Good afternoon r/dividends,

A lot has been happening behind the scenes recently regarding the state of this subreddit, so I will skip any buildup and get right into it.

Firstly, I would like to officially welcome Jack Larkin (aka u/finance_student), who has officially joined the moderator team.   I have brought him on to help turn Automoderator into more than just my copy-pasting default templates in a pattern that somehow works.  So be nice, be kind, and wish him luck because I have no idea how to code.

The second order of business is that I am officially hiring not one, not two, but **three additional moderators** for r/dividends.  Unlike Jack, these individuals will be active and participating members of the community who will be brought on to accomplish very specific tasks.  The three positions are each very different, and listed below.  Please read each one carefully.

1. **Old Reddit Ambassador**: As many of you know, I have absolutely zero experience coding anything complicated.  Unfortunately for me, Old Reddit does not care.  Anyone who has worked with Old Reddit knows the stylesheet page is simply a blank text box responsive to (I think) CSS code.  According to Reddit statistics, a large number of r/dividends userbase utilizes either Old Reddit, or 3rd party Reddit apps that are pulling data from Old Reddit.  I am fully committed to ensuring you guys have just as positive of a user experience as those of us who use new Reddit, so I am recruiting an experienced Reddit coder to assist in this task.  In essence, you would help me make r/dividends look good on Old Reddit and its third party apps.  That's all this position is.  You will serve as an ambassador to that community, and make sure our Old Reddit userw are having a great user experience.  You will not need to handle the mod queue or work on automoderator.
2. **Wiki Writer:** Another important goal of mine for this subreddit is the establishment of a wiki for any and all new dividend investors.  It will be an introductory guide walking new investors through everything they need to know to get started, so that hopefully I can eliminate every single ""Im X years old and don't know how to invest"" post.  Excellent writing skills will be required.

3. **Chat moderator:**  We are pleased to announce that [/r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends) is now live on Discord. Come join the conversation in our live chatroom!  To facilitate the live chat, we have partnered with other finance related subreddits and are joining an already established and very active server. Our new server hosts the official chats for [/r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading), [/r/forex](https://www.reddit.com/r/forex), and the FXGears communities, and boasts more than 1600 online members.  Our channels within the chat server are #dividend-investing and the #stocks-general / #stock-resources rooms, but of course you are encouraged to check out all subject matters hosted on the server.  You can find links to the new chat in the top navigational bar and the sidebar.  Individuals applying for this position would be responsible for overseeing the chat on these new channels.  You would be granted moderator status here on the subreddit and would be granted permissions necessary to enforce the rules accross both platforms. 

Those of you who wish to apply may send an application through modmail.  Applications will be open until Tuesday September 1, when I will start contacting the finalists. 

Edit: it was asked if mods were still allowed to participate in the community (apparently some subreddits want their mods to not interact with the subreddit unless they are acting as a mod.) I don't know what subreddits do that, but rest assured such a rule would not apply here. Any mods would still be free to post, comment, rate, etc. All the fun stuff. You can just think of being a mod as a side thing you do on the weekends or something if you want to. All I really need is people with the requisite skills who want to make the community better. You will get a custom flair of whatever you want, and you will get to help make this community a better place.

WHY I REGRET:

1. $150B in debt. That’s an insane total. Although to their credit they held true to their promises to prioritize paying off debt. 2 years ago it was at $180B

2. Seemingly everyone hates them, even their own customers. No one loves them

3. 5G infrastructure costs will probably be a significant burden on profitability/cash flow

4. A history of baffling and overpriced acquisitions, like DirecTV

5. They are now the smallest telecom provider of the Big 3, behind Verizon and post-merger TMobile

6. They strike me as an inefficient bureaucracy

7. Long term share price depreciation, despite a historical bull market

8. Mass exodus of Time Warner leaders since the acquisition


WHY I’M HOLDING

1. Love that dividend

2. HBO Max has growth potential comparable to Netflix. Share price growth could be comparable to Netflix’s too, right?

3. They’re selling off underperforming business units and becoming more agile/efficient

4. Holding telecom is like holding a utility, but supermassive and less accountable to society. And T pays the biggest dividend in telecom.

5. Too big to fail?

6. New, seemingly-refreshing, dynamic leadership in CEO John Stankey

The next ex-dividend date for Waste Management is in 2 days, and I am looking for a solid company with broad exposure that is guaranteed to have a healthy dividend among this pandemic. Please see my analysis below and let me know your thoughts. 

1) Sales will be dampened near term, but the industry as a whole will grow approximately 6% by 2025.

2) Healthy Gross Profit Margin around 40%, with a positive EPS and trailing EPS

3) Current and Quick Ratio well above 1.2, which is a sign of servicing short term debt in an excellent manner in case needs arise. In times we are in, I take emphasis on these ratios. 

4) Of course what I am here for is the 1.86% dividend yield. While this stock won't get neck snapping returns like the rest of the market, I am guaranteed this dividend if we go into a long and deep recession/depression. There is only 1 larger competitor (Republic Services), but I think WM barely can call itself a duopoly and think they are one of the safest stocks for yield.

As a way to make a little ""extra"" supplemental cash to buy more shares would it be beneficial to sell covered calls? I did have a quick question.

When you setup a covered call. I'm thinking of doing the 2wk which is avail. for $O. When I setup my 10% rise on the call and someone actually purchases it, does it automatically take my shares at that moment and pay me so I can quickly reinvest and repurchase those 100 shares (now, 100+ with that credit), or does it wait until the end of the contract time and I could be potentially paying a lot more per share so I end up losing money?

Honestly I've never seen that crazy of a portfolio for 401K, it's like an ETF with all sorts of holdings in bonds and weird MFs, which I know nothing about. (Don't invest into something you don't understand).

I propose to move it over to roth IRA and split into:

O - real estate exposure

HD or WM  - seem to be solid. Unlikely to be disrupted by any ""tech"" in the next 20 years.

And SPHD - monthly drip 

Possibly SCHD - I think it's a very solid ETF.

I have additional investments in crypto and some tech ETFs so I'm still relatively diversified. But that 401K isn't working.

**Edit, I'm definitely dropping HD, for some reason I thought it was $86/share. WM probably not going to make the cut.

For growth I have exposure through other ETFs, where dividend income / drip isn't the primary goal.

Originally we were looking into him selling to rebalance a little bit. He's about 7 years from retirement and will be using the dividends as income but for now it's being reinvested. The two issues I saw is that they're a decent yield in the taxable and not efficient. The other issue was that they are weighted much more than most of his other stocks. At first selling seemed like the best option but the most I thought about it would taking dividend reinvestment off of these two make more sense? And then dividends can be reinvested into other stocks? Over 7 years it seems like it would rebalance a little bit by reducing them a few percentage points over the years.

t3_inkewb,I need some direction,"I’ve just gotten into DRIP not too long ago and I’ve been buying small amounts of shares with T and KO every week with my paycheck. I thought I was finally grasping the concept but then in my never ending quest for knowledge I’ve found (thanks to you guys) that I could be kicking myself in the ass in 10 years if I continue down this path. So T has pretty attractive stats for DRIP but I looked at the stock price now, compared to 5 years ago, and it looks like it peaked in 2017 and has just fluctuated below that since then. 5 year return for shareholders is -10%, included dividend returns is 18.9%. So now I want to just take all of my money out of T. Now I’m looking at KO, the growth is not very significant. The shareholder returns for 5 years is 33% and 56% with dividend returns. That looks a lot better than T, but the industry made 43% and 63%, while the market made 45% and 90%. I’m thinking now that they’re both poor investments. Am I missing something?

The decline in stock price does not reflect the fundamentals of the business. Let's look at what happened last time UNM traded this cheap versus earnings

March 2009 stock is trading at 10.18 with 2.57 EPS.....10.18/2.57=3.96 P/E

March 2010 stock trades at 24.77 with is a  9.56 P/E....9.56 is extremely close to the 20-year normal valuation of 9.39. That a 140% return in a YEAR.

Let's say you held to April 2018 which is the last time the stock was fairly valued imo. You would of had a 19.9% return if you held for 9 years

t3_io9hds,An unnecessarily detailed explanation of the rules that nobody asked me for,"The title says it all.  This post will be linked somewhere as an FAQ of sorts for any individual who has questions about the rules of this subreddit.  These rules were developed through feedback and dialogue with the community, so they are enforced with vigor.  Feedback is always accepted in regards to the rules, so they should not be considered unchangeable.  If this community wants a rule change, make a post under the ""Meta"" flair, and make a compelling argument.  If the community approves, I (the moderator who enforces the rules) will change the rules.

&#x200B;

>**1. No self Promotion:** Posting to promote user-generated YouTube videos, blog posts, advertisements, websites, surveys, etc. all fall under this category.

Q. *What does this rule cover?*

A. ""Hey guys, check out my \[insert content here\].""  In all seriousness, We do not care what it is.  If you made it, you do not get to post it here.  End of discussion.

*Q. What exceptions are there to this rule?  Every rule has exceptions right?*

None.  The etc. is meant to cover every possible form of self-promotion imaginable.  Surveys, cryptocurrencies, and ""professional"" hacking services are just some of the things posted here that I have removed under the [etcetera](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/etcetera) clause.

>**2. All advice must be given in good faith:** This is a community dedicated to the sharing of genuine advice. As we want to help people prepare for their entire financial future, advice shown to be given in bad faith will be removed with no warning. Repeated violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban.

The definition of what advice is considered good faith is very hard to pin down, as there are some people who genuinely have no idea how to invest, yet are trying to help other people invest.  As such, I have been reluctant to remove posts for this reason.  I tend to leave enforcement of this rule up to Automoderator, using its filters and Reddit's aggressive site-wide spam filters.

One example of a time where I did not sit on the sidelines and removed a comment directly under this rule was when a user suggested the best way to get rich was to take out a seven figure loan, load up on T and MO, then use the dividends to pay off the loan.  Any experienced or even beginner investor could tell you dozens of things wrong with this idea, and judging by the user's post history, it was clear the post was not in good faith, so it was removed.

>**3.**  **No encouraging insider trading, violations of SEC/ESMA guidelines, or other unlawful activity**

Perhaps the simplest rule to understand.  Do not suggest people do illegal things.  Plain and simple.  When determining what is legal or not, I am looking at US and EU laws primarily, as well as laws from places like Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, etc.

So if you are a member of the LGBT+ community, do not worry.  I will not remove your comment if you mention being gay or something like that.  Or if there are any third world countries out there with some obscure law against owning too many goats or whatever, you goat hoarders can rest easy.

>**4. No solicitations for due diligence:** Do not create a thread with the specific intention of getting other users to research a company or companies for you. If you want to start a genuine discussion about a particular company or companies, let us know your thoughts.

This rule is the most commonly violated by a mile and a half.  Nearly 40% of all posts and comments removed by me violate this rule.  No other rule comes within 10 percentage points in terms of rule violations.  This is also the rule that went through the most revisions when the rules were being developed.  It is the main reason I am even writing this post, so let me explain it.

Rule Four is designed to prevent posts like this one:

>**AT&T**  
>  
>Looks like a great stock.  Anyone here own it?  Seems high on the analysts lists too

Notice the title is the name of a random company (changed to protect the OPs privacy) and the description devoid of details.  While I did not contact the user who posted this, I can guess their intentions were for someone to research the company for them and tell them if it was a good investment or not.  This is an almost textbook definition of a solicitation for due diligence.

This does not mean you are not allowed to ask other users for their thoughts when posting.  Quite the opposite.  Every post should be taken as an invitation for other users to share their thoughts.  The way to not break this rule is really simple.  Give people something interesting to talk about.  Or if you want a more nuanced explanation, tell people what you know about the company or companies and try to spark a genuine discussion.

[This is a gold standard example of how to spark discussion about a company.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/il030b/waste_management_recession_proof_stock/) I link this post by u/ForehandFinancial to demonstrate how easy it is to post something good, substantive, and high-quality.  It makes you want to scroll down and read the comments.  Notice how they have already done their due diligence, citing numbers, and states they are looking for additional thoughts and suggestions not previously considered.

&#x200B;

>**5. Do not critique another user based on the size of their portfolio:** Especially in this economy, people are trying to set aside whatever they can. Do not judge how much other people have in their bank account. You do not know what they are experiencing.

I hate how this has to be a rule, but unfortunately some people are just rude to each other.  Reddit has site-wide rules against harassment and threats.  This is just a refinement of that rule into an investing community mindset.  Pretty self explanatory.

&#x200B;

>**6. No referral links**:  Links generated when sharing one's portfolio through brokerages like M1 are exempt.

This could technically loop back around into Rule 1, as it is self-promotion.  Most brokerages have these, and will give you money or stocks if you convince someone to sign up using them.  Some brokerages also have a button that allows you to share your portfolio.  For example, [this is my M1 Portfolio](https://m1.finance/wbI3wBr2ioGc).  If I could remove the link I would, but since I cannot, these kinds of links are allowed since they have a separate purpose.

&#x200B;

>**7. No low effort posts:**  Low effort could be loosely defined as those posts which could be theoretically created in under sixty seconds. It can also be defined as any post which took a sub-minimal amount of effort to create.

Another very subjective rule, though I am not sure really how to make it objective.  On this one, I tend to defer to the community.  If enough people are reporting this post as low effort and I agree, then the post will be removed for low effort.

&#x200B;

>**8. No unauthorized bots:**  Bots that lack the authority to operate on [r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/) will be banned permanently with no warning. Bots which are determined to not contribute meaningfully will be classified as unauthorized.

If you want your bot to be allowed on r/dividends, then send a message through modmail and we will discuss it.  Every day Automoderator is removing bot posts.

&#x200B;

To close, here is a statistic some of you may find interesting.  Whenever I remove a post or comment, I give a reason.  This is the percentage breakdown of rule violating posts, and why they were removed.  Reddit sitewide rules, and the actions of Automoderator are not counted here.

Rule 1: 17.02%

Rule 2: 2.12%

Rule 3: 2.13%

Rule 4: 38.29%

Rule 5: 7.38%

Rule 6: 1.13%

All 3 have ex-dividend dates in the next month. I hope you find this useful, and please let me know your thoughts in the comments!

# First Horizon National Corp. (FHN)

Founded in 1864, First Horizon National Corporation (ticker: FHN) is a bank holding company based in Memphis, Tennessee. Its banking subsidiary, First Horizon, is the largest bank in Tennessee and the fourth largest regional bank in Southeast USA. They employ over 5000 employees at over 250 bank locations across the Southeast of the US.

*Key points:*

**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 10th September 2020

**Dividend Yield**

Currently, FHN has a Dividend Yield of 6.02%. This a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. FHN paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $6.40 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 40% from that low.

**Dividend Payout Ratio: 62.37%**

Ideally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - however, FHN have a history of paying a steadily increasing dividend. For 14 years – from 1993 to 2007, FHN increased their dividend yearly – with the only exception being 2000-2001 when they maintained it. Furthermore, from 2011 to the present, FHN have increased their dividend yearly – with the only exception being 2013-2014 when they maintained it.

**Price to Book Ratio: 0.60**

As of July 2020, FHN stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.60, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $16.67, with a share price of $9.96 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $9.60). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.

**Institutional Ownership**

FHN have 57.60% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.

# Valley National Bancorp (VLY)

Founded in 1927, Valley National Bancorp (ticker: VLY) is a bank holding company based in Wayne, New Jersey. Its banking subsidiary, Valley Bank, currently operates over 230 branch locations in northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, as well as Long Island, Florida, and Alabama. They employ over 3000 employees.

*Key points:*

**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 14th September 2020

**Dividend Yield**

Currently, VLY has a Dividend Yield of 5.61%. Like FHN, this is also a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. VLY paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $6.02 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 16% from that low.

**Dividend Payout Ratio: 56.90%**

Ideally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - however, VLY have maintained their dividend for the past 5 years, with the stock price largely stable during this time as well. According to Zacks, of the 8 analysts tracking VLY – 4 recommended it as a ‘Buy’, 3 as a ‘Hold’ and just one as a ‘Sell’. The average price target is currently $9.22, which is a decent upside of about $2 per share.

**Price to Book Ratio: 0.71**

As of July 2020, VLY stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.71, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $11.08, with a share price of $7.82 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $7.46). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.

**Institutional Ownership**

VLY have 61.90% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.

# Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV)

Founded in 1888, Synovus Financial Corporation (ticker: SNV) is a bank holding company based in Columbus, Georgia. Its banking subsidiary, Synovus Bank, operates 294 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. They employ over 5000 employees. Other non-bank subsidiaries that are wholly-owned by SNV include Synovus Securities, Synovus Trust, Synovus Mortgage, Creative Financial Group and Global One.

*Key points:*

**Upcoming Ex-Dividend Date:** 16th September 2020

**Dividend Yield**

Currently, SNV has a Dividend Yield of 5.96%. Again, this is a generous dividend for the sector, however it has not had a negative effect on the stock price. SNV paid their Q2 and Q3 dividends since the stock’s lowest price of $12.12 in March 2020, and currently the stock is up almost 70% from that low.

**Dividend Payout Ratio: 48.60%**

Ideally, to consider the dividend to be truly stable, the Dividend Payout Ratio would be less than 50% - so the Dividend Payout Ratio of 48.60% for SNV is exactly what we want to see. In addition to this, SNV have a history of paying a steadily increasing dividend. For 14 years – from 1993 to 2007, SNV increased their dividend yearly without fail. Furthermore, from 2013 to the present, SNV have increased their dividend yearly.

**Price to Book Ratio: 0.60**

As of July 2020, SNV stock was trading at a Price to Book ratio of 0.60, which is quite attractive. At that time, the Book Value per Share was $34.30, with a share price of $20.53 (at time of writing, September 8th 2020, the share price is $21.78). This implies that the stock is currently trading at a considerable discount.

**Institutional Ownership**

SNV have a whopping 81.00% Institutional Ownership, which implies a good level of confidence in the stock. However, these levels can vary from quarter to quarter.

On 4 August 2020, Synovus also announced a donation of $1 million to UNCF (United Negro College Fund) to set up The Synovus / Calvin Smyre Scholarship Campaign. The fund will include scholarships in Synovus' five-state presence for African American students to attend historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other higher education institutions.

I’m looking to start my dividend portfolio, transitioning out of my oil and gas heavy portfolio into something a little more stable and building a source of income.

I’m also looking at eventually contributing to my dividend fund aggressively out of pocket, as well as with my DRIP. O and STAG are definitely on my list of “to buy” and I have been considering ARR. O and Stag are simply big choices due to word of mouth, I feel my ability to do DD is pretty lacking. I could use a link or two that could dumb things down to where I can do more effective DD than simply looking at the news and dividend history. Any pointers?

Also, in regards to ARR, I like how it looks, it appears that I can make good returns with it, and while the dividend has been scaled back recently, it is still a decent position in my eyes. The dividends have been paid consistently for 7-8 years, and while they fluctuate, they are consistently paid. What else should I look at before picking up said shares?

t3_ipn37q,Industrials Pie,"RTX, GD or LMT. 

I originally purchased RTX as it had been beaten down following the spin off of CARR and Covid - (ex?) dividend king and has been solid in the past with a 3.49% yield and 44% payout ratio. Diversified into military and civilian areas. 

GD is one which I must admit I bought on a whim at the start of my dividends career... I read about their products,  orders etc. and decided yeah why not. Since then they have had trouble with unions, fires on ships and generally not a great time. They are still heavily beaten down from Covid, have a 2.9% yield and a 33% payout ratio.

LMT is one that I do not own, but have had my eye on. I was put off this one at the beginning of my career due to the share price and slightly lower yield. They make the F-35 jets which are just being introduced around t he world and probably more on the pipeline. 2.49% yield with a payout ratio of 41%. They don’t seem to have been beaten down as much which says to me that their revenues shouldn’t have been impacted as much as the others. 

What I am leaning towards doing is dumping RTX or GD (maybe both) and going in with only LMT.

For me this would help with only having to read up on one company, the share price seems to be a bit more stable, more orders to be filled. Maybe I’m talking rubbish though.

t3_itkbhc,Safety of MAIN's Dividend / Trajectory,"I was looking through MAIN's portfolio of companies it lends/lent to and, while I'm aware dividend investors really really like MAIN, I was really unimpressed by the portfolio and am getting concerned about the safety of their model over the next year or two. Recessions are really dangerous for BDCs in general, much less something affecting small businesses in particular. I see they've lent to restaurants and things like pool-builders whereas another prominent BDC ARCC is way more focused on software and healthcare. They do trade at a premium to NAV which means raising capital is easier for them whereas ARCC is trading at a slight discount--keeping in mind discount to NAV is not a good thing for these kinds of companies unlike ETFs or whatever else. 

They survived the Great Recession well enough along with ARCC but does anyone get concerned when they see the kind of companies MAIN works with in this environment? They seem extremely shareholder-friendly to their credit (I guess since they kind of have to be) but I'm hesitant to invest in them at this point.

With that, I would like to be able to supplement my income with dividends.

Sales grew 21% last quarter, although some of this could be attributed to lockdowns and stockpiling.

Proceeds from the SPAC have been used to pay off debt and more will be spent on advertising and marketing to both retain new customers and entice more. 

Even while private they have expanded their portfolio of brands via acquisitions.

Fourth largest snack brand in the US by sales in 2019.

Their goal is to be the fastest growing pure-play branded snack platform of scale in the US.

Paying a dividend of $0.2 per share this year.

They aren’t a dividend king or aristocrat at the moment. But the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this one was too big too miss. Their payout is low enough that there is plenty of room for growth as their revenues increase.

I've been evaluating my retirement situation using calculators and estimates all over the place to make sure I'm on track and to try to optimize where I'm putting my money. I have a 401k which is projected to be enough for me to retire on as long as my house payment plan doesn't go through the floor. I'm a little late to the game but I just opened a Roth IRA with plans of using it for dividend returns to supplement the 401k and minimize my taxes in retirement (I'm 35, solid job, planning to retire around 60, 10% into 401k, working on paying off debt currently and almost done).

I did a lot of extensive research into dividend stocks, screeners, I think I have a watchlist saved somewhere I was going to invest in but recently got a promotion and if I'm honest with myself, I won't have as much time as I'd like to keep up with an individual stock portfolio. I started looking into ETFs with decent yield such as VYM, SPHD, and SPYD (basically crossed off the list, I've heard bad vibes with that one) and possible NOBL due to the aristocrats. The function of yield and account value/stock price isn't lost on me, but it all basically boils down to share count right? I tossed around the idea of investing the ROTH into an index fund and cashing it out at retirement and investing that money into a dividend ETF or such, and now I'm looking into just investing into VYM in the Roth and supplementing with my 401k until I hit Min distribution requirements. 

Ok, so wall of text complete. I think my question boils down too this, do ETF's have a history of increasing dividends or do they stay relatively chaotic? Is it possible to semi accurately project what you'd expect your dividend income to be in 25-30 years with an ETF? I've been trying to find historical information on them and they don't seem to steadily increase as a stock would so trying to hash out the math is proving difficult. I tend to overthink everything too, if that wasn't obvious. I'm looking to invest the weekly amount required to hit the yearly cap and investing most/all of that into a dividend ETF for inherent diversification and relative safety (strongly leaning towards VYM) and would like other's opinion on whether this is a terrible idea. The main reason I'm not trying to overly diversify is due to the target date fund in the 401k already. I'll leave it at this and answer questions as needed.",2,0.75,1600726572,"[['FLL', 1]]",EFT,,

I am interested in ETFs tracking aristocrats/growing dividends. So I was wondering, as the ETF contains this kind of stocks, the distributed ETF dividend will be also ""growing""... however my findings so far are not saying so, is my assumption wrong?

|2018|0.808|
|2017|0.975|

t3_j0tt3k,"Seeking advice on dividend plays - STWD versus T, VZ","I am 45 years old. Just started into stocks this year. I like the idea of having a regular annual income from a dividend play after retirement. I am a little bit confused about one thing. A lot of people recommend T and VZ for example (respectively 28-ish and 58-ish a share right now). If I understand dividends correctly, you get paid per share. I dont understand why people dont prefer to invest in a cheaper option like STWD as opposed to T or VZ. Here are my basic comparisons if you have $2000 to invest as an example: STWD - $255/year; T - $144/year; $VZ - 69/year

STWD:

15/share

annual dividend payout - 1.92/share

$2000 gets you \~133 shares (133 shares \* $15)

retirement income: 133 shares \* 1.92 = 255.36/year in dividends

general remarks: stock has been slowly rising over the year; average rating is Buy; not a Dividend aristocrat, but most dividends seem to be paid (growth toward DA status?)

T:

28/share

annual dividend payout - 2.04/share

$2000 gets you \~71 shares (71 shares \*$28)

retirement income: 71 shares \* 2.04 = 144.84/year in dividends

general: its down pretty hard; lots of debt; large potential to swing up in the long term

VZ:

58/share

annual dividend payout - 2.46/share

$2000 gets you \~34 shares (34\*$58)

retirement income: 34 shares \* 2.46 = $69.36/year in dividends

general: seems to be pretty solid performer

I am assuming that someone would only go for VZ over the other 2 if they want to see large growth because the dividend is going to be significantly smaller. Am I looking at this the right way? Does anyone have recommendations for a very cheap and conservative long term dividend play thats going to net me the most dividend payout income when I retire? Any thoughts on STWD versus other similarly priced dividend artistocrats or other similarly priced dividend plays? AMCR and STWD both seem really interesting to me. Thoughts on GE or Ford? Im thinking of putting my eggs in 2-3 different baskets.  Maybe STWD was a much better play when it fell to $9 in March than it is now?

I also dont understand the whole dividend stock versus dividend ETF.   A dividend ETF is just like any other stock isn't it?   There's no dividend payout.  I thought the reason why dividend aristocrats have such a large upside is because of their almost guaranteed dividend.  Wouldn't I compare, e.g., VIG to other ETFs in other sectors to determine which has the best growth outlook?",3,0.72,1601223423,"[['STWD', 6], ['T', 3], ['AMCR', 1], ['GE', 1]]",EFT,,

t3_j0ii21,My DD on Macatawa Bank Corporation (MCBC). Please critique it!,"I just wanted to start off by saying I am still fairly new to the market, having only started November of 2018. This is my first time doing DD on a bank and also my first time writing up DD to share with others, so please critique it! Let me know if there are metrics I should have used, ones I shouldn't have used, the format of the post, etc. 

**SUMMARY**

Macatawa Bank Corporation (NASDAQ: MCBC) is the holding company for Macatawa Bank. Macatawa Bank is a Michigan chartered bank with 26 full service branches in Kent County, Ottawa County, and northern Allegan County. Banking services include commercial, consumer, and real estate financing, business and personal deposit services, ATM's, Internet banking Services, trust and employee benefit plan services. 

**The Stock**

Currently MCBC is trading at $6.35 versus a book value of $6.37. Year to date, MCBC is down 42.95% compared to the iShares US Regional Banks ETF down 32.51%. MCBC is currently yielding 5% with a payout ratio of 36.36% for 3 months ending June 30th. Their payout ratio for 2019 was 30%. 

**Behind the Scenes**

The CET1 ratio compares a bank's capital to its assets, measuring how well capitalized a bank is to withstand unexpected losses. Currently MCBC has a CET1 ratio of 14.9% meaning they are well capitalized, compared to the industry average of 12%. The minimum set by the Basel III Accord is 7%.  They have a Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 14.9%, compared to the 8.5% minimum allowed. 

Since 2015, MCBC has enjoyed increasing revenue every year, growing from $65.4 million in 2015 to $83.7 million in 2019. Likewise, they have seen increasing net income every year since 2015, with 12.8 million in 2015 to 32 million in 2019.  They have a safe debt to equity (D/E) ratio of .90 for 6 months ending June 30th, 2020. For 2019, their D/E ratio was .89. 

Even with interest rates being near zero, the increase in mortgages helped MCBC beat expectations in Q2. Ronald Hann, CEO, stated ""Despite the challenging environment in the second quarter of 2020, we produced $7.6 million in earnings for the quarter.  Mortgage gains in the second quarter of 2020 were three times higher than a year ago and more than offset the reduction in net interest income caused by the significant decrease in market interest rates in 2020.""

**Conclusion**

Overall, I think this is an extremely attractive entry point for MCBC, even with the inherent risk they carry being a regional bank. They are capitalized extremely well, leaving them plenty of room to continue to pay their dividend, and along with their strong balance sheet, are well positioned to weather out this market environment.",27,0.9400000000000001,1601171410,"[['MCBC', 6], ['III', 1]]",EFT,,

I just reached my goal of $1250 a year in dividends, now shooting for $2k a year. I have just shy of $25k invested and have gone from YOLO'ing money into the market to making much more informed decisions. My next goal is to have $50k total invested in the next 5 years. Disclaimer: This is broad information I have learned on my journey through investing. I have tried to do my research but cannot guarantee everything below is 100% up to speed. You should always do your own research as well !

The portfolio: https://m1.finance/SueDRtc7ioXN

One thing to keep in mind here is that this is not strictily a dividend portfolio. It also contains elements geared toward growth. The idea being that somewhere down the line ill harvest the growth and dump it into more income generating assets when im older. The weighted percentage of the allocations as they are now is also simply a reflection of how I want auto-invest to spread out the money. The actual weight of the individual holdings is slightly different.

If you want a really well thought out portfolio that is strictly geared toward generating income with a low expense ratio, opportunities for appreciation and low volatility I highly recommend checking out this portfolio put together by rao-blackwell-ized on the M1 finance subreddit. https://m1.finance/HwnAhLIW6Mp6

You can read about the methodology behind his creation of this pie [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/M1Finance/comments/go08t3/i_created_a_dividend_pie_for_you_guys/) which is a highly worthy post on its own. 

**Tax efficiency** 

You should start by maxing out an IRA or at the very least contributing to one. Dividends earned in traditional IRAs are not taxed when they are paid or reinvested, rather retirement account withdrawals are taxed at one's current income tax when they are withdrawn. Roth IRA funds grow tax-exempt, including the payment of dividends, and so these are not subject to taxation.

For me personally I just picked a target date fund in my IRA and let it ride. I wanted to pursue dividend investing in a taxable account so that I could use the dividends if I wanted to to supplement my current income. The perfect example being back in march when I was furloughed and it took forever to get on unemployment. My dividends bought groceries that month. 

You have to ask yourself what YOU want and what your goals are for dividend investing. Now onto the meat and potatoes of the post !

**Qualified vs Non qualified dividends** 


There are two types of ordinary dividends: qualified and nonqualified. The most significant difference between the two is that nonqualified dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates, while qualified dividends receive more favorable tax treatment by being taxed at capital gains rates.

What classifies a dividend as ‘qualified’ for tax purposes?

 Ordinary dividends are the most common type of distribution from a corporation or a mutual fund - as they are paid out of earnings and profits. Examples of ordinary dividends that do not qualify for preferential tax treatment include:

* Generally, dividends paid out by real estate investment trusts (there are instances where dividends can be considered qualified, provided certain requirements are met - - See IRC §857(c))
Generally, dividends paid out by master limited partnerships (However, if the MLP is invested in qualifying corporations and it receives qualified dividends from those investments, it would pass out qualified dividends to the partners)
* Dividends paid on employee stock option plans
* Dividends paid by tax-exempt companies
* Dividends paid on savings or money market accounts by mutual savings banks, mutual insurance companies, credit unions and other loan associations

I see alot of people investing heavily into REIT's because of their attractive yield. Thats well and fine if you know what you're buying but keep in mind REIT's are taxed at a higher rate than other dividends and some can carry volatility because of the assets they invest in (shopping malls, brick and mortar retail etc.) For this reason it is my opinion that REIT's should only be held in tax differed accounts like an IRA to maximize your tax efficiency. Bonds are a good alternative to REIT's. The yield might not be as high but they're much more stable. 

**Choosing stocks vs index funds** 

There are alot of great companies out there paying attractive yields but you shouldnt get caught up chasing the yield if the company itself is performing poorly. If the company does not have the fundamentals to support its dividend then you could be at risk of it lowering or disappearing all together down the line. 

I would take a lower yield from a company with a track record for growth and increasing its dividend every time over a company with a high yield but is struggling to support itself. In a buy and hold type setting, you want to ensure that what you pick is set up for long term success. 

The [Dividend aristocrats](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-aristocrats/) are a good place to look for quality companies that have a history of increasing dividends.

This leads me to my point in choosing what to invest in. If you dont have the time or willingness to track individual stocks, then I highly recommend just going with a broad index fund approach. The yield may be lower but ETF's are inherently more resilient against downturns and market volatility since theyre a package deal of many individual holdings and can provide easy diversity in your portfolio. One thing to keep in mind though is overlap. If you invest in multiple index funds theres a good chance those ETF's may hold positions of the same stock. Thats fine if you're ok with increased exposure to that particular holding but it IS something to be aware of. 

You can use the fund overlap tool at https://www.etfrc.com/index.php to see the overlap in your index funds.

**Expense ratios**

These fees — inherent in all mutual funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds — can significantly drag down your portfolio returns. And although they can’t be avoided completely if you invest in these funds, you can take steps to keep these costs as low as possible.

What is an expense ratio?
An expense ratio is an annual fee expressed as a percentage of your investment — or, like the term implies, the ratio of your investment that goes toward the fund’s expenses. If you invest in a mutual fund with a 1% expense ratio, you’ll pay the fund $10 per year for every $1,000 invested. That money is swept out of your investment in the fund, meaning you won’t get a bill for the charge. That’s one reason why these fees are easy to miss. Looking for funds with low expense ratios is key to making sure your making the most efficient use of your money.

**Bonds and Treasuries** 

This is an often overlooked area in dividend investing. While bonds pay interest as opposed to a dividend meaning theyre taxed at your normal income rate, they carry much more stability than REIT's. Treasuries and municipal bonds may also be exempt from federal or state taxes all together depending on a number of factors.
 
* Interest income generated by municipal bond funds is generally not subject to federal taxes, and may also be exempt from state and local taxes if the bonds held by the fund were issued by the state in which you live.

* Funds that exclusively hold U.S. Treasury bonds may be exempt from state taxes. 

Bonds represent the debts of issuers, such as companies or governments. These debts are sliced up and sold to investors in smaller units - for instance, a $1 million debt issue may be allocated to one-thousand $1,000 bonds. In general, bonds are considered to be more conservative investments than stocks, and are more senior to stocks if an issuer declares bankruptcy. Bonds also typically pay regular interest payments to investors, and return the full principal loaned when the bond matures. As a result, bond prices vary inversely with interest rates, falling when rates go up and vice-versa.

The bond markets are a very liquid and active, but can take second seat to stocks for many retail or part time investors. It is often for professional investors, pension and hedge funds, and financial advisors, but that doesn't mean that part-time investors should steer clear of bonds. In fact, bonds play an increasingly important part in your portfolio as you age and, because of that, learning about them now makes good financial sense. In fact having a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds is advisable for investors of all ages and risk tolerance.

Im comfortable with paying a higher tax rate on bonds because I know theyre stable and can provide a safe harbor to generate income while preserving capital against downturns and inflation.

**In conclusion**

Dividend investing can be a great way to pursue your financial goals. The thing you have to remember about investing in general is that regardless of your approach or strategy it is simply a financial vehicle to get you from point A to B. Understanding the fundamentals of dividend investing (your tax liability, what to invest in, your risk tolerance etc) are all important factors to figure out before you yeet your money into the ether of the market. There is an incredible amount of information to digest so give it time and dont get discouraged. This is a buy and hold approach with a long timeline !",308,0.97,1601498405,"[['MLP', 1]]",EFT,,
t3_j2npmg,3rd Quarter Report - $7524.55 in Dividend Payments,"My 3rd Quarter recovered nicely from the major dump my portfolio dividends payments took in the 2nd Quarter.    1st Quarter - $7,149.44, 2nd Quarter $6,477.73, 3rd Quarter $7,524.55.

At the end of the 1st Quarter I dumped REITs without regard for when they went ex-dividend.  Normally when exiting a market sector I do it gradually and collect as many dividends as I can on the way out.  Not this year, I felt like it was time to get out of most REITs and I did.  So my dividends plummeted in the 2nd Quarter.  

I have recovered nicely in the 3rd Quarter, I also did some trading, selling off several positions after they went ex-dividend and bought  stocks about to go ex-dividend.  

As always, my highest payer was T at over $1200 and my lowest KR at $45.00.  I expect to fall again in the 4th Quarter because I migrated to higher quality but lower paying stocks like MMM and AAPL during the 2nd and 3rd Quarters.  Unless I boost the income through trading.

t3_j3mfnf,Dividend Yield vs Dividend Growth,"I wanted to ask people’s opinions of looking for yield vs dividend growth. I invest in dividends in a retirement account I have for extra income that I earn. As a result my ability to contribute comes intermittently according to when I get paid for my consulting/speaking work. However, I end up with some lump sums to initiate positions with.
I have made it a practice so far to invest in a reasonably sustainable dividend (lower payout ratios etc) with a good yield ( above 3.5%) so as to make the best use of the money I am putting into the market. However, not all of these securities have a high 10 yr dividend growth rate ( such as VZ that increases dividends a measly 2% yearly) and I am wondering by how much one should balance yield with growth rate. For example would GD at a roughly 3.18% yield but 10% dividend growth rate be a better longer term investment than VZ at 4.2% but lower growth rate.

t3_jbh0c2,British Petroleum (BP) & Energy Sector Discussion,"Hello r/Dividends, today, I'd like to discuss BP and the energy sector as a whole.

I initiated a small position in BP yesterday. Some may ask, u/DeepHouseGod, why would you initiate a position in a company that's recently cut their dividend and has a terrible balance sheet?

Here's why:

* Even with the dividend cut, I still locked in a starting yield of 7.5%. Even if BP suffers another 50% cut, i'm still looking at a 3.56% starting yield.
* The price of oil is going to recover eventually, and as the USA (and world) eventually reopens completely, oil demand will increase. This will help them pick up pieces from the oil crisis/COVID-19 and help them expand their business or increase dividends.
* Even in their depressed state, their market cap is $56 billion. In a market where smaller fish are being snapped up (see COP looking to buy CXO) or dying out, BP is still well positioned and is a major player.
* The company says it wants to have net-zero emissions by 2050.
* Value stocks in general have been under-preforming growth and this trend won't last forever.
* BP is vertically integrated.
* Operations in 78 countries, so they have excellent geographic diversity.
* They have significant renewable energy exposure (biofuels, wind, smart grid, and solar) and are looking to expand their stakes in renewables to ensure they remain viable.
* They're actively trying to increase their exposure to renewable energy.
* BP owns a 19.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, the largest publicly traded oil company in the world based on hydrocarbon reserves.
* They're finished paying for the 2010 Gulf oil spill.

Additionally, I have no problem buying when there's fear in the oil market. Let's be honest, the oil & gas industry isn't going anywhere, even with the push towards renewables. Will we see even more industry consolidation? Probably. If we want to think of how the major energy companies can expand their businesses and become more viable long term, consider the following:

The oil & gas sector is still significantly larger than the renewable energy sector by market cap. There are many intriguing small cap companies in the renewable sector that would make fantastic acquisition targets for oil giants such as BP in the future. The fact is that many of these oil giants would be better served to simply buy and integrate renewable companies into their existing business than trying to develop tech on their own. This is how I foresee the oil majors remaining relevant into the future as the world's dependence on oil decreases.

I am curious to hear what other dividend investors think about BP, the energy sector as a whole, and the direction it's heading. I think for an industry that's (still) filled with a juicy yields, it warrants a serious discussion.

Happy investing y'all!

t3_jc6x4c,"Trying to make dividend portfolio, any comments welcome","Hi dividend fellows (new here, don't be to hard on me),

I will be investing around 10k to dividend stock during the end of the year. I have another portfolio for acc stocks, and one for funds. I will use dividends from div portfolio to invest to these two other portfolios in monthly basis (Thus, I want stocks with monthly or at least quarterly divs, for investing to funds I have no fees). And I am planning to increase div portfolio to 20k during next spring. 

My goal is to get very high dividend yield with investment spread to different areas. And as FYI for the suggestions, I am not able to buy US dividend ETFs cos of EU regulations in my home country. Only stocks are okay.

I was initially thinking to spread my starting portfolio to these companies 2k each:

*stock (divs) = reason why interested*

**HRZN** (9%) = because it invest to startups, so inherently different to REITs etc.

**TRSWF** (5,29%) = renewables with dividends, take my monies 

(is CWEN (4,21 %) better than TRSWF?)

**ARR** (12,31%) = mREIT, adding some typical mREIT with high yield, price is also low after covid19, but the trust seems to be still breathing. Any comments about their future?

**T** (7,58%) = Aristocrat with some stability

**MAIN** (8,24%) = Capital trust, and also very long track record.

This portfolio would have avg dividend of 8.484 %.

I could also add 1-3 more by reducing the amount I invest to one stock, but I pay around 10 dollars for fees when I buy, so don't wan't my fees go over 1%.

t3_jg86of,Thought on EPD dividend investment,"EPD is a mid level pipeline company who has been very beaten down by the dump in oil prices / demand. However, they aren't really sensitive to oil prices themselves, just the flow / delivery / storage. THIS IS a risk as drilling operations have been scaling back - but with the drop in demand comes more storage. They are one of the few big midlevels also doing oil storage.

Their dividend is at 10+% which appears to be fairly safe as the [cash] payout ratio is 61%, less likely to cut their streak of dividend payout (generally like to see it less than 85-90% so should have some wiggle room) They have access to 7 billion in liquidity as well. 

Lock in 10.4% dividend at its current price, and as the price increases the dividend payout % goes down, but its actually still based on the price you bought it at, so you keep earning 10% just in dividends going forward? As long as the dividend doesn't get cut



consensus price target: 24
low target: 19; high target 29

But they say don't buy an ETF if you wouldn't buy the stocks contained within and I do believe that's accurate. Why would I ever buy stock in H&R Block?

 Here is what I bought with the proceeds:

More O. Price dip looked good and they are excellent stewards of their assets. Hard to think of a more shareholder-focused REIT. Their IG companies will always maintain a store presence. I want a lot more of them at these rates.

More GOOD. One of my only ""buy the dip always"" small cap REITs. Gladstone is a fine businessman who is moving the trust to more industrial holdings. *Trustworthy* is how I describe him. Collects high fees but never, ever lets shareholders down.

BNL. They performed well when they were private and recently IPO'd. Expecting a 6% yield with this diversified trust *with* price increase. I think this sub should look into them more since they're internally managed and are looking to replicate or increase performance from when they were private. Diverse, yet lots of their retail holdings are Taco Bell leases... which hardly ever go out of business.

MPW. A hospital real estate trust. Don't see them going anywhere, though I kept this a small position until I learn more about their financials. Hospital real estate is great, but they seem a little opaque to me.

PDT. A corporate bond fund that has *increased* its NAV since IPO many years ago. High hopes and a complement to the PTY I already own so it balances out the latter's scary high premium.

LAND. A Gladstone REIT that focuses on specialty crop farmland. No real international competition for its crops, its California land wasn't impacted by wildfires, keen on water rights, and returned close to 21% this year. A fine hedge if nothing else which I plan to own *forever.* Real estate worth over 800 million and growing.

ORCC. A BDC that posted no non-accruals this year which a large teacher's pension fund invested in. I'm a bit weary of this sector but I am okay with it. I like ARCC, HTGC, and TSLX, and hold these companies, but posting zero non-accruals in a terrible year quite frankly speaks volumes about their underwriting.

MNR. An old and venerable industrial REIT which is well diversified and perhaps overlooked. Ugly buildings book good returns, my friends.

PGX. A solid preferred shares fund that just about beat SPHD anyway. Wanted to start this for a little while now.

And UTG. A well run CEF focusing on utilities that PDT does not. Biggest holding is NEE, which had a tech-like run up this year.

And there you have it. Of all these investments I am most hopeful for BNL (for its price target though I doubt I would sell) and LAND, which is my first real ""hedge"" investment. And a good hedge it is. Absolutely love owning stock units in a farmland trust that is increasing its holdings in a big way. I can taste the blueberries. Good farmland would be far more worthwhile than gold in an apocalypse after all!

Now that I have most of my watchlist out of the way I feel I can build on these small positions over time. In two years I can't wait to see where things sit. And then five years, and ten.

The only companies remaining on my watchlist are: NNN, HTA, and REG (along with more O and STAG). I expect to start small positions in these this Friday. Then, I will build upwards and compound always.

They do publish their top tenants but they have about 2500 properties and I was curious as to why it was hard to find the majority of them. The CEO got back to me this morning on this very question. Thought some here might enjoy his response:

""There is a Schedule 3 that we file annually at the back of the 10-K with a list of locations, though it may not be what you're looking for. Our disclosure is really strong at the portfolio level - credit strats, master leases, coverages, credit loss walks, etc. We try to connect the dots for you regarding performance. And this is precisely the kind of data our board wants to see - and also me as CEO. As you get into individual addresses, there is literally no valid conclusion you could ever arrive at with respect to portfolio quality. I would call such disclosure a data dump....but of no informative value. And there is a lot of this kind of thing in REITland. For instance, we provide data on sector and industry exposure and provide square footage data, so you can effectively compute the rent per square foot of our limited service restaurants. Let's say, you'd like to compare that to other net lease peers. You cant! No one else discloses this. Even then, were we to hand our location data, you'd have no clue as to the store coverages...and whether the locations were in master leases or not or whether we have credit enhancements- this is crucial data. You'd have no idea, unless we were to disclose it, how much we spent for a property. And you'd generally have no idea of the underlying tenant credit quality. All you might be able to do is to make a high level determination as to whether you like the real estate. Of course, you may not like the real estate...and may wonder why we bought it. But you might like it better if you knew the price or knew what other real estate we bundled the lease with! Anyway, that's why we stick with contract and portfolio disclosure. Plus, since we do so much through direct origination, were we to provide a list of tenants, our peers would simply start to call on them. That is what happens every time a tenant of ours ends up in our top ten list. For instance, we bought a lot of National Veterinary Associates clinics several years ago at cap rates in the 8 and up range. After they got on our list, the rates fell into the low sevens and today they can trade for rates in the mid sixes. We want to avoid repeats like this where possible!

t3_jkl9qj,Thinking of Selling QYLD,"...and reinvesting the proceeds into PDT/PTY. Both CEFs still offer high yields but have history at their side. I like QYLD but suspect it will trend downward by its very nature in the long term, whereas these other two funds have a good history and are essentially bonds rather than options. That said, the stability of these CEFs isn't what it looks like since even if the price is similar to when they started, they started years ago so inflation has eaten up some real returns rather than nominal. But the benefit of them lies in how easy it is to see historical NAV. In the case of PDT, NAV has increased. I'm unsure of how to chart the NAV of QYLD.

Most of QYLD's troubles seem easy to place historically, however. Its 2018 drop coincided with increasing tensions in the administration's trade war (many investments dropped) and of course covid this year. 

I know there was a recent post on QYLD. But I'm curious if anyone would prefer it to these CEFs or vice versa, and if it's likely QYLD could eventually face some price appreciation rather than degradation given its basis in high percentage buy-write options.",5,1.0,1604013613,"[['NAV', 2]]",EFT,,
t3_jkk5oh,My Complete Guide to Dividend Investing,"**Where to Start?**

* ""Get Rich with Dividends"" is a great book that provides a foundational understanding of Dividend investing. The pdf can be found here: [http://psulibrary.palawan.edu.ph/wtbooks/resources/pdf/908250.pdf](http://psulibrary.palawan.edu.ph/wtbooks/resources/pdf/908250.pdf)
   * It is around 200 pages but is a very easy and informational read. Even if you are familiar with dividend investing, it can be useful to read up on certain chapters that you are unfamiliar with
* There are basic ideas fundamental to dividend investing
   * Dividend Compounding/Reinvesting, Dividend Yield, Dividend Growth, Payout Ratio
   * Dividend Company Categorization: Dividend Champions, Dividend Contenders, etc. 
   * Dividend ETF's: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120415/how-dividendpaying-etfs-work.asp)
   * Drip Investing: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp)

**How to Pick Dividend Stocks?**

*  Spreadsheet of dividend paying companies along with key metrics 
   * [https://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp](https://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp) 
      * Since the users are international, this tool does have dividend data for Canada, Europe, Eurozone, and UK
      * The only downside of this tool is that it is updated monthly. Therefore, I would recommend using it to find dividend stocks you are interested in and to put them on your watch-list.
      *  I created a website that collects the same data as dripinvesting but uses an API to update daily. Due to self promotion rule, please feel free to pm for a link. The tool below is similar but less detailed.
* Dividend Screener Tool
   * [https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/screener/](https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/screener/)
   * Has several important metrics but not as comprehensive as the spreadsheet above
* Checking historical performance
   * [http://www.tickertech.com/cgi/returns.mpl?symbol=O&smonth=01&sday=01&syear=1995&emonth=10&eday=29&eyear=2020&compareto=SPY&other=](http://www.tickertech.com/cgi/returns.mpl?symbol=O&smonth=01&sday=01&syear=1995&emonth=10&eday=29&eyear=2020&compareto=SPY&other=)
   * I especially like this tool because you can compare the value of an investment in a stock over time with dividends reinvested
* Understanding your own personal goals
   * This is honestly one of the most important things in my opinion. Depending on your goals and timeline, the metrics you value will vary. With that said, you must acknowledge that dividend investing is a long term investing strategy. Compounding takes years and requires reinvesting dividends. You can use this tool to determine what kind of dividend yield and compounding you would need to reach your goal: [https://www.dividend-calculator.com/monthly.php](https://www.dividend-calculator.com/monthly.php)

**Tracking Your Dividends**

* DivTracker (app, free): Tracks your portfolio value, yield on market, yield on cost, yearly income, cost basis, and has several cool features. Contains a calendar with dividend payouts and displays the dividends you are expected to receive in the year. The cooler features are not free, however. 
* The Rich (app, free): Similar to DivTracker for the most part and has a nice UI
* There are definitely more tools out there that maybe other users can add. Regardless, tracking your dividends is important to make sure that you are meeting your goals and to keep you motivated

**Brokerage** 

* I don't really have a preference but below is a list of brokerages that support fractional shared and DRIP as that might be important to some investors
* M1, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, E Trade

**Options** 

* Selling Puts: [https://www.lynalden.com/selling-put-options/](https://www.lynalden.com/selling-put-options/)
* Covered Calls: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/rookies-corner/writing-covered-calls/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/rookies-corner/writing-covered-calls/)
* The strategy is often referred to as the wheel: [https://optionstradingiq.com/the-wheel-strategy/](https://optionstradingiq.com/the-wheel-strategy/)
* Here is a very comprehensive book to options: [http://terredegaia.free.fr/ppics/Trading/Mcgraw-Hill%20-%20Option%20Pricing%20And%20Volatility%20-%20Advanced%20Strategies%20And%20Trading%20Techniques%20-%20Sheldon%20Natenberg%20-%20(1994).pdf](http://terredegaia.free.fr/ppics/Trading/Mcgraw-Hill%20-%20Option%20Pricing%20And%20Volatility%20-%20Advanced%20Strategies%20And%20Trading%20Techniques%20-%20Sheldon%20Natenberg%20-%20(1994).pdf)
   * It is over 400 pages, so I would advise reading it if you are very interested or you want to read specific subsections relevant to dividend investing 
* Options are definitely not necessary to succeed as a dividend investor. If done correctly, it can provide benefits such as lowering your cost basis.  There is obviously risk involved and requires a more hands on approach than simply buying stocks. 

**Tax**

* This is an important point to consider. Given that the audience is international, it is probably in the best interest for you to do your own research. Understanding how dividends are taxed obviously increases the amount of money you receive from dividends

**My Personal Tips**

* Dividend investing is a long term strategy and requires reinvesting dividends for maximum potential 
* I see a lot of people focused simply on dividend yield, and I would advise caution against it. The consistency of dividends and a growing dividend is key to amazing returns. Therefore, payout ratio, number of consecutive years of growing dividends payed, and dividend growth rate should be at the top of your list when screening stocks alongside dividend yield. 
   * When evaluating a company, don't just think about how much they will pay you today but whether or not they will be able to continuously increase how much they pay you for years to come.
* If you have a strong understanding of dividend investing fundamentals, I would recommend investing in individual stocks rather than ETF's. Your portfolio is essentially your personal ETF without the fees associated. With that said, ETF's can be a great starting point for beginners and it's always a good idea to research the stocks that make up any individual ETF. 
* Dividend investing can be a really hands off and stress free investing strategy if done correctly. The reason I am so passionate about dividend investing is because I feel that my money is working for me without much work from me. I put in a lot of time upfront to make initial investments but now I primarily just reap the benefits of it. I hope that I can share this appreciation for dividend investing to the community here and beyond.",421,0.99,1604009922,"[['API', 1], ['TD', 1], ['E', 1]]",EFT,,

&#x200B;

I think this upcoming week will provide a fantastic opportunity to enter an investment into any of the three tickers I listed at a tremendous discount to fair value. 

Election uncertainties and fears of a Biden win have caused the share prices of defense sector stocks plummet despite strong financial results in the most recent round of earnings.

The outlook for the defense budget is actually great. Both Biden and Trump would be **extremely unlikely** to significantly cut the defense budget. Both have formally stated that they would like to maintain a strong military presence to counter the rising threat of China albeit through different strategies. Biden wants more defense spending to be allocated towards cybersecurity/drones while trump wants more conventional options.

&#x200B;

**Dividend Analysis:**

All three of the companies have respectable dividend safety and growth histories. Right now $RTX is the most undervalued due to the headwinds from its acquisition of UTX and the stagnation of revenue streams related to aviation/planes until global air travel recovers.

$LHX has the absolute highest CAGR of \~20% over the past 20 years with a solid 5 year DGR of 10%. 

$LMT is not too far behind $LHX with a 5 year DGR of \~8%

$LMT offers a slightly higher starting yield at \~2.7% compared to $LHX at 2.1% though nowhere nearly as high as $RTX at 3.5%

**Fundamental Analysis:**

$LMT is likely the safest bet here. It has the largest defense backlog and is trading at a lower PE ratio relative to LHX. It also doesn't face the headwinds of exposure to the aviation industry like $RTX.

$LHX offers the biggest potential for future growth. These guys are trading at a large P/E for a reason; they've been experiencing explosive growth and are in drones + cybersecurity services which are likely to boom.

$RTX is a deep value/recovery play.",56,0.9500000000000001,1604166442,"[['RTX', 2], ['LHX', 2], ['LMT', 1]]",EFT,,

Abbvie	                  5.94	500

So, a total of 3,500 USD invested which will add 158.63 USD to the yearly income after withholding tax. AT & T needs no introduction in this community, since a lot have already been posted in here.

The story is quite different with Unum Group. I haven't seen any one talking about it here.  
 

When I look to the fundamentals for Unum they look really appealing to me a P/E below 4 and P/Bookvalue of 0.34, the one thing that concerns me about the them is that the profit margin has seen a small decline, but overall they look undervalued to me from a fundamentals perspective.

t3_js2apj,Dividend Growth Investing - An Updated In-Depth Guide + Breakdown (November 2020),"# Introduction

Hello everyone! This will be an updated post and in-depth breakdown for the Dividend Growth strategy. It is important to understand how companies need to be evaluated differently based on the investment philosophy you are pursuing. Now, investing in a dividend growth strategy takes time and patience, depending on your income goal, it can take awhile before a dividend portfolio can fully support enough cash flow to sustain your lifestyle without you needing to rely on a full-time or part-time job. But that is the exciting part, once you have enough income from the dividends you can retire or work a job that you perhaps find more exciting?

# The Strategy:

The dividend growth strategy is focused on building up a portfolio of high quality companies that not only pay out a dividend, but have regularly been increasing the dividend payout. The end goal is to create passive income to live off the increasing dividend payouts. So the focus is placed more on the cash flow for wealth rather than the stock appreciation (appreciation is just an added bonus).

NOTE: **Dividend yield is not main focus.** A common misconception is that a very high dividend yield is the most important measure, however, a yield that is considerably higher similar stocks in the same industry may indicate not a good dividend but rather a depressed price due to company issues. This price may signal an eventual dividend cut or elimination if the situation continues. Most dividend ETFs will filter out the top percentage of dividends yields for this reason.

The strategy here is on the **dividend growth**. If a company increases their payout overtime it is going to have an insane snowball effect when the dividends are reinvested (kinda like the snowball effect for paying off debt). Dividend growth investing uses the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends into the same investment to increase your future dividend payments. With each reinvestment, your shares grow slightly larger. With slightly more shares, your next dividend payment is slightly larger. With enough time invested in solid companies, the growth effect is amazing. This is why dividend growers are so important, they add more fuel to this compounding effect!

If you really want to see this effect visualized, check out the charts for Warren Buffets wealth. In 2018 alone, Berkshire raked in **$3.8 billion** in dividends – “a sum that will increase in 2019,” Buffett said in the annual letter. The great majority of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are dividend stocks. And many of those stock are growing their dividend.

# Evaluating Companies for this Strategy:

Since the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:

* Dividend payout ratio:
   * Dividend payouts less than 50%-75% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable.
   * Does the company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term?
* Dividend Yield:
   * Ensure the company is paying a dividend and that the dividend yield isn't too low to start.
   * Watch out for dividend traps! Extremely high dividend yield for non-REITs can often signal an unsustainable payout! Look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (Do research after this ofcourse, this doesn't immediately mean it is healthy)
* Dividend Growth Rate
   * Look for companies that increase their dividend payout year after year.
* Free Cash Flow to Equity:
   * This is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. If a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.
* Debt to EBITDA ratio (Earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)
   * A company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. See AT&T vs Verizon!

NOTE: The companies are often broken into these categories based on how long they have increased their dividend:

* Challenger: 5+ years
* Contender: 10-24 years
* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years
* King: 50+ years

There are ofcourse many other factors. Consider the business, does it have a sustainable model (Coca-Cola & Pepsi)? Is its market shrinking (See oil companies)? Do you like the company and management?? For this type of investing (any type really), you need to know what you are investing into!

# Where to Start and Key Things:

Many of the companies that should be looked for are ones we all recognize because they are so well established and have very wide market exposure. They have incredible staying power for these reasons, and very often have enough money to expand into new markets to remain relevant. This is their significant advantage over startups (many of which they just buy up anyways)

Let's take PEPSI for example. Pepsico (NYSE: PEP) is a company in the Consumer Defensive Sector, its wide variety of iconic brands and products give it a very large global moat.

* Current Dividend Ratio:  2.89% (November 2020 based on share price of $141.75)
* Current Annual Dividend Payout:  $4.09
* Average 3 Year Dividend Growth Rate -  **8.60%**

Looking at this we can see that PEPSI is not only paying a very nice dividend, but it is increasing it at an average of 8%! So even if you don't buy more shares of the stock it will start to pay you more each year just for holding it. The next step from here would be to look into the financials. Essenitally we are just checking to ensure they are not burdened with too much debt, have sharply decreasing revenue, or payouts that exceed their current cashflow.

Other companies that would be good examples (just a few)

* AAPL - Apple - Challenger - IT
* MSFT - Microsoft - Contender - IT
* JPM - JPMorgan Chase - Challenger - Financial
* VZ - Verizon - Contender - Telecommunications
* JNJ - Johnson and Johnson - King - Healthcare
* MMM - 3M - King - Industrials
* IBM - International Business Machines - Aristocrat - IT
* KO - Coca-Cola - King - Consumer Defensive

ETFs are an excellent option, however due the large difference in strategies amoung them they will have to be discussed in a separate post. However some notable ones include: NOBL, SCHD, VYM, VIG, DGRO, and DRGW. (Amoung many many others)

# Advantages and Disadvantages of this Strategy:

Disadvantages:

* Dividends are not always guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends due to financial pressure. At any moment, companies can decrease their dividend payout or completely get rid of it. **However, many of the companies on the Dividends list maintained and increased their dividends during this time, this highlights the importance of investing in quality companies.**
* Unless you are holding these stocks in an IRA you will pay taxes on them.
* When compared to index investing it decreases diversification since you're really only invested into more “large cap” stocks. You'll be missing out on the mid-cap and small-cap stocks
* Some say dividend payouts of the sign of a dying company. For some perhaps this is true, however a strong counter argument is this. If a company is well established and the payout for moving into a new market sector, or a new acquisition wouldn't be favorable, a company can instead payout dividends to entice investors rather than potentially sacrifice company value just in the name of potential growth.
* You have to pay more attention to the companies you are investing into to ensure they remain healthy and can continue to grow and increase their dividend.

Advantages:

* **Reinvesting dividends during sideways moving markets, bear markets, and corrections, purchase more shares with the dividend while the prices are lower. Later, when prices recover, the return is actually enhanced by the temporary fall in the stock price. Reinvesting dividends and accumulating more shares during corrections and bear markets greatly boosts dividend growth investing returns in the long run. This is a significant advantage of dividend stocks over growth stocks in less than ideal market conditions.**
* Historically dividends have provided 43% of the S&P 500 total return from 1930 - 2017 (according to Blackrock). Dividends provide an ongoing return while waiting for capital appreciation.
* The snowball effect of dividend growth compounding can provide competitive returns regardless of whether the price of the stock increases in value or not.
* Creating passive income and preserving capital. Like all stocks they are an excellent hedge against inflation.

# Performance & Final Thoughts:

It depends on what timeframe you are looking at, if say we take from December 1999 - 2017 the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.37% per year. But if we take other timeframes then the S&P500 is dominant. Beating the S&P500 over the long term is near impossible, but **beating the S&P isn't the goal of this strategy**. This strategy is focused on passive income generation. Imagine if checks were rolling in every week during the COVID lockdowns even if you weren't working?

Please supplement this post with your own research. Compare this strategy to general index investing and growth investing. Find what is right for you.

The hope is this post provided insight into this strategy and evaluating dividend paying companies.

t3_jt8it2,$BSTZ Dividends on No-Dividend TECH Stocks,"$BSTZ is a CEF (closed-end fund) which holds a portfolio consisting of some pretty high-growth tech stocks like Tesla, Shopify, Square, etc. The CEF sells covered calls on a certain % of their holdings on these tech stocks and distributes this in the form of a monthly dividend.

Current yield is an eye-popping 5%. Best part is that the CEF has had 44% increase in share price this year-alone

Now here's the real kicker: **$BSTZ is trading at a DISCOUNT TO ITS NAV DESPITE MASSIVE OUTPERFORMANCE**

A discount to NAV means that if the fund liquidated everything it held and distributed it back to shareholders, the value of those returns per share would be greater than the current share price.

**Before you say $BSTZ is a new fund and has no history look at $BST**

$BST follows an extremely similar investing philosophy to $BSTZ but with some different tech companies. $BST has been around for years but unlike $BSTZ **$BST TRADES AT A PREMIUM TO NAV AND IS LESS ATTRACTIVE AS AN INVESTMENT.**

Oh, also every December the fund tends to rebalance the portfolio, locking in capital gains on assets that it distributes in the form of a special dividend.

Barry Sternlicht, the CEO, thinks the company is incredibly undervalued at current prices. I have to agree, as he gave his reasoning behind his valuation of the company which seems to be spot on. I've been holding this baby since $11 but am considering buying more if it pulls back, would love to hear everyone's thoughts.

""So if you believe our $3 of fair value that's not in the undepreciated book value, bringing our fair value above $20 a share, let's take the $15.86, let's take the $3 out of it, that's $12.06. That's the $3 of equity assets that are largely either fully leased industrial buildings or affordable housing assets that are in some of the best markets in the country and stay completely full because rents are 30% below fair value of garden apartments of market-rate apartments. And then take out the accumulated depreciation of $1.30, you're buying our stock at $10.76 against the GAAP book value of $15.86 That's 66% of the GAAP value of our company.

Our average loan is 61% LTV. So you're buying these assets in the loans at $0.41 at par of the fair value of the asset. And for that, you're getting a 13% dividend yield. Seems a little ridiculous.

So there's no way property values and what we have linked against are down 60%. So I don't think anyone's even considered that as a possibility. So our issue has always been the same issue. We could pay our dividend forever, and forever is a long time."" -Barry Sternlicht in Q3 CC

The only argument you could make against these guys is their debt, but that just comes with the territory, another lockdown which seems unlikely even with the rising cases, or if their portfolio really has taken a huge hit in value...

t3_juxsj3,3M (NYSE: MMM) - A Quick Guide/Review - A Dividend King,"# Introduction:

3M, previously known as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, might not be the most iconic corporation, however it is one of the largest in the US, in fact, they are one of the few companies actually still in the DOW Jones. 3M has been an incredibly innovative company since its humble beginnings, it currently holds over 118,000 patents. They are involved extensively in industry, worker safety, US health care, and consumer goods, producing over 60,000 different products, and operating in over 70 countries.

Right now, 3M is organized into these four business segments:

* Safety and Industrial
* Transportation and Electronics
* Health Care
* Consumer Discretionary

# Company Strengths & Risks:

Strengths:

3M is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of increasing their dividend.

3M has strong branding, strong control over a large number of patents and technology, and is a low-cost producer of good. The company is well diversified amoung its 4 segments, this shields them against cyclic revenue streams. Additionally,  3M is expanding rapidly into new emerging markets, and has been good at making small acquisitions that propel growth/product acquisition.

Risks:

The companies number of patents is also a disadvantage, it causes the company to have to allocate more money towards litigations. In addition to this, the low-cost good produced by other companies require 3M to be more careful with its pricing. Lastly, the products they produce have a life-cycle, so more money needs to be allocated to R&D to produce relevant and quality products. (Not that they have had an issue with this)

# Let's Look at the Numbers:

NOTE: Numbers are currently for November 2020 and are likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$5.88|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|3.46%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|10.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|9.1%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|66.67%|
|Free Cash Flow / Share|$10.86|
|Revenue|$8.35 Billion|
|Debt / Equity Ratio|1.91 (Healthy)|

3M has some healthy looking financials despite COVID. This has a lot to do with their diversification, while they have lost money in Industrials and Consumer products, they have buffered this with their exposure to Health Care, in fact the company is producing many of the N95 masks being used now.

3M has very strong prospects for dividend growth. Their EPS payout of 66% indicates they still have quite enough wiggle room to continue increasing the dividend, and the 3, 5, and 10 year increases have been superb. They can be given a pass for their 1 year increase due to COVID.

If fact, lets take their 3-year average and project that forward to guesstimate what their future payouts could be. (These are estimates! The actual payouts could be wildly different.)

|Year|Potential Payout (Based on 9%)|
|:-|:-|
|2021|$6.40|
|2022|$6.61|
|2023|$6.84|
|2024|$7.03|

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

3M is an excellent dividend growth stock. The company has a wide moat, strong revenue, is smart with its acquisitions, and has healthier levels of debt compared to many similar companies. The company would be strongly recommended for any dividend/dividend growth focused portfolio.

Please supplement this with your own research, there are more numbers out there, plus the company has an interesting history and it is worth reading up on if you are interested.

For me, it is one of my larger positions. Don't take that and run though! Always do your own research and come to your own conclusions about whether or not you like and want to invest into a company.

You can't really do this in a Reg T account because you need 150% or 200% of the stock's value held in reserve. I was considering switching to Portfolio Margin, and it looks like there's no margin difference between being long or short a stock there.

Downsides include:

* If the company gets bought out or management changes or \[...\], they could rise even if the original business was unlikely to rise.
* The stock you buy could tank, and now you've lost borrowed money.
* You have to pay dividends & interest on the stocks you short.
* The stocks you buy could cut or stop dividends.
* You can buy options to mitigate catastrophic loss, but those eat into your net yield.
* You can sell options to avoid paying or receiving dividends, but they can be assigned at any time so maybe not reliable for long-term arbitrage.",6,0.76,1605792145,"[['T', 1]]",EFT,,

The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

>\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
>  
>\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
>  
>\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

>\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
>  
>\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
>  
>\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

t3_jyefws,Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - An in-depth Stock Analysis,"# Introduction:

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll, so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson & Johnson:

Johnson & Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson & Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

>\-  Johnson & Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
>  
>\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
>  
>\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
>  
>\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

>\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
>  
>\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
>  
>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

Introduction:

Betterware de Mexico(BWMX) is a consumer Direct-Sales/e-commerce platform that focuses primarily on household products. It recently came public following a merger with DDMX in 2020 and is the first Mexican company to list on the NASDAQ. With an estimated distribution network of 946,000 associates and 54,000 distributors, Betterware is rapidly expanding to cover its market Niche.

Highlights:

43% Revenue growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 60% growth in 2020

47% EBITDA growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 71% growth in 2020

94% Free cash flow growth through 2015-2019, Further acceleration to 105% growth in 2020

Growth is supported through 40% CAGR growth in employees from 2015-2020

19.8% market penetration in 2019, targeted penetration is 26.8% in 2022. Highlights the very long runway Betterware has to grow their market

5% dividend yield with significant ability to increase based on 94% growth in free cash flow

Significant competitive advantage in the distribution network results in 98.5% on-time deliveries with 2-day shipping(wow, that sounds familiar).

International expansion is possible, with Colombia and Peru currently being targeted.

Dividends appear to be apart of long-term strategy with this quote pulled from the 10k ""Due to these low capital requirements and closed working capital cycle, the Company has high cash conversion rate enabling it to annually serve their shareholders through dividends.""

Trades at a 12.53 Forward P/E, which is extremely attractive when you factor in its growth rate

Weakness:

Distribution network requires a significant amount of people, pandemic significantly increased the need for work due to low employment, so talent was easier to attract. When the economy recovers, Betterware will likely find it harder to recruit associates to grow the distribution network.

Only issued dividends in the past 3 quarters, so we can not be certain this is a long-term stradegy.

The business has significant exposure to Mexican currency

The company is likely to experience volatile share prices as low liquidity and history should see significant moves both up and down. 

Last thoughts:

The company has insane potential to grow in both share price and dividend. The valuation likely only exist due to its low profile, having just debuted on the public markets, the argument could be made that this deserved to trade at 50+ multiple. The company has the potential to support massive growth going forward and shares similar characteristics to AMZN, BABA, & MELI all of which have been incredible investments for its shareholders. Of course, being such a small company worth just over a billion dollars there are significant risks that they cannot scale this business and are unsuccessful in the international market.

t3_k118g4,Dividend Capture Strategy,"This tutorial is the process that I go through using dividend stocks to find and evaluate my swing-trades every month. If you have any idea’s or questions about the strategy, please comment below. 

Lets say that we have a stock XYZ that pays a dividend on a monthly basis. At certain points during the month we might not know when the next dividend payment will “officially” be paid out. Most monthly dividend stocks pay their dividend in a pattern each month like on the 2nd Friday of the month or the 10th trading day of the month, etc. The company usually doesn’t publish this information but if you inspect the historical data then you can see the trend or pattern that they use for their ex-dividend date and record-date. We might be able to estimate when the ex-dividend date and record-date will be but until the company officially announces these dates then it will only be an estimate. The day when the company actually announces these dates is referred to as the dividend declaration date.

After the dividend declaration date occurs we have all the dates that we need for the swing-trade, namely: the ex-dividend date, dividend record-date, and the dividend payable date. If we are not able to estimate these dates before the dividend declaration date then it will not be possible for us to do the analysis needed to setup our dividend swing-trade or dividend reinvestment position. For this reason, I typically only enter positions when the ex-dividend date has been confirmed by the company. 

Now that we have all the dates that we need we can start looking at what each one of these dates means.  If I want to collect the dividend on each share of XYZ that I purchase, then I must make sure that I buy XYZ shares before the ex-dividend date. If I buy a stock one business day before its record date, my trade will only settle the day after the record date. I would therefore not be a shareholder of record for receiving the dividend.

So, in order to make sure that I qualify for the dividend I want to buy the stock at least two business days before the date of record, or one day before the ex-dividend date. 

[Where to buy](https://imgur.com/a/ohm0AgT)

Using the graphic above as an example I would need to buy the stock on Monday the 5th to be eligible to receive the dividend payment. Monday the 5th is two trading-days before the date of record and one trading-day before the ex-dividend date. Now it should become more obvious why I use one trading-day before the ex-dividend date as the sell date for my swing-trades. This is a major part of my strategy as I use the run up into the dividend ex-date to make swings.  

The goal for my swing-trades is not to capture the dividend but rather sell my shares at a premium price to the buyers that are willing to pay a premium during the days leading up to the day before the ex-dividend date so that they will be on the record books and will therefore collect the dividend payment for the stock. You can receive gains many times the amount of the dividend by buying early and then selling the rights to these dividend shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date.

People who are in search of high dividend yield using the dividend capture strategy are willing to pay a premium for their shares in the days just before the ex-dividend date because they don’t want to miss out on the dividend payment. The fear of missing out is a very motivating force in the minds of men and women alike and it can be seen in the data that I have collected over the last few years.  

So just to recap the overall strategy is to find a dividend stock that typically has a run up into the ex-dividend date.  To do this I look at historical data 2-14 days prior to determine when the run up into earnings typically starts. 


A couple of suggestions:
1.)	Don’t swing trade stocks that are at or very close to their 52-week high 
2.)	Look for stocks that have been in a down trend since their last ex-div date 

Example: 

To start I narrow my search to stocks that have an ex-date 2-3 weeks out.  This usually brings my window of stocks to research down to about 30-40 stocks.  For this example, I will be looking at stocks with a confirmed Ex-Date between 12/01/2020 and 12/10/2020 this narrows my window down to 18 tickers. 

The stock Tegna (TGNA) looks to have a pretty good setup to me.  TGNA has a quarterly dividend.  At the moment it is about 20% off of its 52-week high..  For this example, I am going to look at the previous 24 dividend Time Periods to determine statistically when Is the best time to buy. 

The below chart shows historically what day has been the best day to buy if I plan on selling the shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date. The chart shows from 2 days out all the way to 14 days out as I have found this Is the sweet spot for the run up into ex-dividend. 

[Historical % returns by day](https://imgur.com/a/Ovuuyh9)

It is clear that for TGNA buying 13 – 14 days out is the way to go (remember this is looking at the pasts 24 dividend periods or 6 years).  Though all of the days running up into ex-dividend are positive.  This is a great sign as history is on our side that this is a good stock to dividend swing trade with. Meaning that historically if I consistently bought all days 2 through 14, I would have been profitable.  To take it one step further I look at what would have happened if I bought 14 days out for each of the previous 24 dividend swing plays. 

In the below chart you can see the exact percent gains for each of the last 24 dividend swing trades if I went with the 14 day out strategy.  When taking a closer look, we can see that there have been swings has high as +30% and as low as -10% which is huge.  I prefer to take a safer approach as I am really only going for a small 3-5% gain each month as I have found that works a lot better in the long run.  

[14 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/OhWXVxY)


To go with a more conservative approach I look at the previous 24 dividend periods for 6 days out.  What I find is that only 2 / 24 previous swing trades on day 6 would have resulted in a loss and only one of those periods would have been significant.  This is more of my style and likely the play that I will go with.

Since the confirmed ex-date for TGNA is 12/10 I will be looking to buy on 12/2 and sell on 12/9.  For this specific example looking at the data I can see that days 2-14 have all be profitable I will likely buy in slowly over the entire period with the majority of shares bought on 12/6.  

I have used this strategy for quite some time and have basically perfected it to the point where on average I am getting returns in the 2-5% region per month.  There are other ways to improve this strategy as well, but I wanted to see if people here were interested in this type of swing trade.   


Important Terminology: 

 Ex-dividend Date: Is the day in which the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value.  Investors who purchased the stock before the ex-dividend data are entitled to the next dividend payment while those who purchased the stock in the ex-dividend date, or after, are not. 
confirmed ex-dividend date – This is the ex-dividend date that has been officially announced by the company on the dividend declaration date. 

dividend capture strategy – A dividend capture strategy is a timing-oriented investment strategy revolving around the purchase and sale of dividend-paying stocks. Dividend capture is specifically the practice of buying a stock just prior to the ex-dividend date in order to capture the dividend, then selling it immediately after the dividend is paid. 


dividend record-date – The record date, or date of record, is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution.",7,0.73,1606339455,"[['TGNA', 3]]",EFT,,
t3_k0izks,Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) - A Stock Review/Guide - Chose this from the Comments,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. The poll is about to close out so I'll be doing the other stock reviews here soon based on the results, but anyways, Intel was one of the stocks requested in the comments by  [hhh888hhhh](https://www.reddit.com/user/hhh888hhhh/), so let's take a look.

Let's start by taking a look at the business model.

# INTC - Intel Corp:

It is one of the the world's largest and highest-valued semiconductor chip producers. Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system manufacturers, produces motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers, integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.

Intel breaks itself down into the following segments:

>**- Client Computing Group** – produces hardware used in desktop and notebook computers  
>  
>\- **Data Center Group** – produces hardware used in server, network, and storage platforms  
>  
>**- Internet of Things Group** – offers platforms designed for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings and home use  
>  
>\- **Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group** – manufactures NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint, branded as Optane, products primarily used in solid-state drives.  
>  
>\- **Intel Security Group** – produces software, particularly security, and antivirus software.  
>  
>**- Programmable Solutions Group** – manufactures programmable semiconductors.  
>  
>The YoY growth of these segments can be found [here.](https://www.intc.com/segments)

**Strengths:**

>\-  Intel’s core business has broad exposure to growing market segments, particularly:  cloud, data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.  
>  
>\-  The company is successfully migrating from a PC-centric business to a data-centric business  
>  
>\-  Intel stock is very cheap right now (P/E 8.9 November 2020), this could potentially lower the risk profile and boost rewards potential.  
>  
>\- They have been very strategic with their previous acquisitions.  
>  
>\- As we will see when we look at the financials, their books up to the start of 2020 are solid.

**Risks:**

>\-   INTC is immersed in a semiconductor market that, while having stronger long-term growth potential, is highly cyclical. Big up years are followed by big down years. This is just the result of supply/demand cycles in the market.  
>  
>\- Intel is gradually losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), and other competitors. (NOTE: AMD & NVIDIA will not be discussed here, this post is for INTC)\*\*\*  
>  
>\- Litigations. This is common for corporations this size. For intel it is mostly antitrust lawsuits.

\*\*\*Interesting note about AMD in the next section.

# Financial History:

Something that was really interesting is, after going through a bit of Intel's 10K I got curious and checked out AMD as well. Right in the very beginning AMD has this as their disclaimer:

>***Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.***  
>  
>Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.

That really says a lot about the stength Intel Corp has in this market. Incase anyone is curious, [here is the source.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248817000043/amd-12312016x10k.htm#sC2A00DC72E841F4EC97A655066A6893F) Risk Factors, page 13.

Anyways let's look into the financials over the last 10 years.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$53,999|$23,571|$10,800|0.5|
|2013|$52,708|$20,323|$16,418|0.8|
|2015|$55,355|$22,713|$25,511|1.05|
|2017|$62,761|$26,179|$34,673|1.3|
|2019|$71,965|$32,861|$33,285|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% YoY, the earnings has increase right along side this. Best has increased gradually, nearly x3 over the 10 years, but it is still only 1x the earnings. Very healthy, especially when we jump into this next section and talk about the cash flow.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|20,960|10,764|15,370|
|2015|19,020|7,326|21,168|
|2019|33,145|16,213|17,697|

Cash flow from operations has increased about 5% YoY over the decade, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 5% as well. $33 Billion in cash flow is pretty crazy, especially considering they still have half of that left over after Capital Expenditures. They have been using the excess cash flow to pay down some debt (\~750 Million in 2019), dividend out, and buy back shares. Over the decade the outstanding shares have decreased by 2% YoY from 5,256 to 4,417.

What is crazy is that Intel is trading at about an 8x multiplier. Their P/E puts them in a nice range for this to be a very strong value play as well, especially considering they are already well established in a sector that is growing rapidly.

# What are their plans for the future?

Intel's intentions are to establish a lead in key technologies that are fundamentally changing computing and communications today and for tomorrow.

Their priority areas for continued growth:

* Cloud Services
* IoT (Internet of Things)
* Artificial Intelligence
   * Intel is acquiring SigOpt to Scale AI Productivity (October 2020)
* 5G
* Intelligent Edge
* Autonomous Driving Technology

How they intend to deploy their capital:

* Investing into R&D to strengthen their competitive position.
* Strategically invest/acquire companies to stimulate data-centric growth.
* Return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.

# Current Dividend History:

Intel Corp has only had 6 years of Continuous Dividend Growth at this time.

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$1.32|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.81% (Based on  $47.01 Price Nov 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|\-|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|7%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.6%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|24.26%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, the payout is very low, however their growth is extremely promising given the low payout of only 24.26%, and the fact that this company produces gobs of free cash flow.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 7% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$1.41|$1.51|$1.61|$1.73|$1.85|

# Closing Thoughts:

At its current price, with the strong financials, and overall excellent business growth prospects, this stock would best be considered a really strong value play. The dividend is there and there is very strong potential for growth, however the payout is still a bit low. Now for a very long term hold, this could be an excellent entrance price, especially if they were to start increasing the dividend growth rate as they increased their cash flow.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. There are always more risks that need to be considered, additionally it is always smart to **read opposing views, don't just read what will validate what you want to believe about a stock.**

There were some requesting a review for Realty Income (O), it will be done likely after the other 2 or whenever, evaluating REITs is a bit of a different process due to their required 90% payouts.

- Its top holdings include AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, etc. 
- It has a 4% dividend with just a 24% PE ratio
- It pays a monthly dividend 

Why haven’t I heard more about this? I see so many people going for SPHD which frankly has wayyyy less stable holdings. I don’t think I’ve seen BST once on this subreddit (which maybe I’ve completely glossed over it) and I’m wondering why? 

Any thoughts from the community? What do y’all think about this holding? It’s a “perpetual close-end fund” can someone explain that part to me? Because other than that this seems solid to me",84,0.9500000000000001,1606422661,"[['BST', 3]]",EFT,,

# Introduction:

Hewlett-Packard is one of the old reliables from the tech industry. HPQ has grown their dividend for 10 years. They are most well known for their focus in personal computers, printers, and 3D printers.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

- Is there revenue growth?

- Is there earnings growth?

- Is the company really leveraged?

- Is there strong cash flow?

## Company Strengths & Risks:

Strengths:

- Very reliable increases in dividends (flattened from 2000 to 2010 then aggressively raised their dividend)

- Strong branding (170 countries, 27000 patents)

- Consistent Share buybacks

- Strong consumer demand in the WFH era benefits HPQ

- Lifespan of printers and computers seems to have increased due to the pandemic

Risks:

- Price doesnt appreciate. Price fluctuates from 10 to 22 (total return might be affected on exit)

- Still high costs due to the split of 2015

## Financial History and numbers

Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HPQ/balance-sheet?p=HPQ) as of Nov 26 2020

Current Annual Payout/Share | $0.78
-----------------------------|--------
Yield                    | 3.48%
10 Yr Div Growth Rate    | 16.29%
3 Yr Div Growth Rate     | 9.18%
1 Yr Div Growth Rate     | 9.99%
Years Of Growth          | 10
Current Payout Ratio     | 29.71
Free Cash Flow / Share   | 2.64
Revenue                  | 56.6M
Debt / Equity Ratio      | -2.79

(napkin math: 6,217,000/-2,228,000= -2.79)

HPQ has pretty healthy financials. The payout ratio is low but the negative debt to equity ratio is a red flag. HPQ claims that they are still streamlining their processes and in response to covid, they are committed to buying back shares and closing real estate locations. Consumer demand most noticeably (and predictably) increased due to COVID, so I think that post streamlining and supply chain recovery, HPQ can look good in 5-10 years.

The free cash flow year over year is increasing too. The dividend increases are outstanding. In fact, let’s project this forward to guesstimate the future payouts. (These are estimates, the actual payouts can range differently)

Year | Potential payout (based on 10.29%)
------|------------------------------------
2021 | 0.86
2022 | 0.95
2023 | 1.10
2024 | 1.27

HPQ is shown on finviz to have a 112.3% ROI. That’s some value for your risk right there. HP's [dividend history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ/dividends/history) makes it all the more appealing to me.

## Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

- Is there revenue growth? Yes… kinda

- Is there earnings growth? Yes

- Is the company really leveraged? Yes (high debt)

- Is there strong cash flow? Yes

HPQ to me is an excellent speculation play for dividend growth. The company is widely recognized and has room for paying out (which they seem committed to). The dividend growth is amazing. The downside is that HP does not increase in price very well. And that negative debt to equity ratio. Therefore, I would recommend this to those aiming to preserve capital (or as a bill payoff) more than to raise capital. HPQ has the ability to continue paying and is committed to growing that dividend.

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research. [Here is HPQ's investor relation page](https://investor.hp.com/home/default.aspx).

t3_k2srtp,Walmart (NYSE: WMT) - A stock review/guide - 2nd Place Winner in the Poll,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. The poll closed out with Walmart placing 2nd and Honeywell placing last, so these two will get stock reviews, starting today with Wal-Mart.

# Walmart | Save Money - Live Better:

Sector: Consumer Defensive

Walmart is America’s largest retailer by sales, selling a variety of general merchandise and grocery items. It operates 11,300 stores in the US, which account for approx 76% of sales in fiscal 2019, with Mexico and Central America \~6%, the UK \~6%, and Canada \~4% beings  its largest external markets.

The company operates several e-commerce properties apart from its site, including Flipkart, Jet.com, and shoes.com (it also owns a roughly 10% stake in Chinese online retailer JD.com). As of 2019, e-commerce accounted for only \~5% of fiscal 2019 sales. However the e-sales growth during the pandemic has greatly increased this.

Walmart has been smart with its acquisitions and partnerships. Walmart has partnerships with Instacard, ThredUp, Shopify, and even Google. The Instacart partnership, together accounts for [nearly half](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png) of all online grocery sales. The partnership with Thredup allows Walmart to sell cheaper clothes on its online marketplace, and Shopify allows 3rd party sellers to sell their goods on Walmart's marketplace as well. Lastly, the Google partnership provides customers voice-enabled grocery shopping and likely much more in the future. Walmart's partnerships and acquisitions are taken to further complete with and provide a market alternative to Amazon.

If you want to see more of their partnership/acquisitions [please look here on page 2.](https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2019/annual/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf)

**Strengths:**

>\- Walmart is the largest retailer in the world providing it unequaled power to leverage their vendor's, suppliers, and manufacturers, keeping prices low with national and private brands.  
>  
>\- Walmart's cost advantage provides significant barrier to entry and is consistently used to disrupt their competitors.  
>  
>\- The company is aggressively investing in its e-commerce segment and focused on strategic acquisitions to complete with Amazon. (Mentioned in the last paragraph above)  
>  
>\-  The partnership with Google is has the potential to be particularly strong due to Walmart lacking strong tech exposure.  
>  
>\- Walmart PLUS memberships, 2 hour delivery, and expansion into drone delivery services.

**Risks:**

>\-  Walmart employs millions people and is facing intense pressure to raise wages. This will have an effect on their profit margins.  
>  
>\- Amazon. Amazon is much much more than just e-commerce.  
>  
>\- Walmart's profit margins aren't as wide as they could be due to keeping prices lower, this does bring them more sales revenue, but they have to be very wary of any competitors lowering their prices further to undermine Walmart's position and margins.

Amazon's threat to many of the traditional brick and mortar industries cannot be understated. Amazon's model is nearly the example of a monopsony, the opposite of a monopoly. They aren't interested in dominating one sector, but ingraining themselves into literally everything. This is why Amazon's model is so disruptive.

In addition to this, Amazon is often the company that raises the conversation of wage increases to undermine it's competitors. The [wage increase to 15$](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181002005317/en/Amazon-Raises-Minimum-Wage-to-15-for-All-U.S.-Employees-Including-Full-Time-Part-Time-Temporary-and-Seasonal) was much more than them ""listening to their critics"", it was a move to further pressure any of their competitors whose margins cannot effectively absorb this cost burden. This tactic, along with Walmarts cheap pricing tactics, is what allows Amazon to nab up companies very cheap. ([See the whole diapers deal](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-quidsi-diaperscom-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos-2020-7)).

# Financial History:

For Walmart we will be looking at the 5 year financials rather than the 10 year due to their push more recently to get into the ecommerce markets.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|$478,615|$33,559|$49,994|\~1.5|
|2017|$481,371|$32,884|$45,930|\~1.4|
|2018|$495,761|$30,966|$46,470|\~1.5|
|2019|$514,405|$32,635|$58,033|\~1.8|
|2020|$523,964|$31,555|$72,400|\~2.3|

The revenue is honestly just insane and shows how large Walmart is, plus it is something like 80-90% of the US population lives within 15 miles of a Walmart or something? Anyways, $478 Billion to $523 Billion, about an average increase of 2.2% YoY. Not bad, they are continuing to grow, but just ahead of currently inflation rates. When we look at EBITDA though, their margins are shrinking/lumpy.  This, based on the company movement, and from what they say in their 10K, this decrease is largely attributed to them moving into e-commerce. These numbers may be significantly different next year since their ecommerce has been growing pretty significantly during the pandemic, [they are estimated at 97% annual growth there](https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-ecommerce-sales-reach-sky-high-growth-in-recent-quarter-2020-8). However note that ecommerce, despite this increase is still a very small piece of the company right now, it is going to take awhile for it to have a more significant impact, but the growth is absolutely there.

The debt is increasing due to acquisitions as well as investment into the ecommerce segment as well. The 2.3x debt/earnings is a bit higher than their historic levels, but again, they are investing right now, and it is still lower than a 3x where it starts to be a bit more concerning.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|$28,337|$10,051|$16,840|
|2019|$27,753|$10,344|$29,444|
|2020|$25,255|$10,705|$13,479|

Cash flow from operations is definitely in line with the decreasing EBITDA so that makes sense. Their CAPEX been consistent the last few years, nothing to really note there since the e-market stuff has already been mentioned. Now for the Free Cash Flow, in 2019 there is a significant jump, this is because in 2019 they took on \~$12 Billion in debt load, this was added to the FCF/E for whatever reason, we can subtract it and say that is was more likely \~$15/16/17 Billion, which is in line with the decline. In 2018 and 2020 they were making debt payments, appears to be about 1.5 Billion for each of those years, hence the lower FCF/E there.

Over the years, in addition to the dividend, they do appear to be using some of their capital to buy back shares, those have decreased from approx 3,200 - 2,850 outstanding over the last 5 years or so. Some would say this is the better way to give back to the shareholders rather than dividends, but others say that it is a way for companies to create synthetic earnings. Take what you will from that. Typically healthy (large) companies will do both dividends and share buybacks, so take what you will from that.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

Walmart (WMT) is a Dividend Aristocrat that has paid and increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$151.60|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|21.89|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.16|
|Yield|1.42% (Based on  $151.60 Price Nov 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|7.2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|1.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|34.45%|

Strictly from a Dividend Growth perspective, the payout is a bit low and the dividend growth has sharply decreased as the company continues to focus on e-market expansion. In addition to this, the yield on cost is of lower value right now, had the stock been purchased earlier when it's price was closer to 100$, it would have been an excellent buy, at the current price and yield though, there are better prospects.

From a value perspective... well Walmart over the years has traded closer to an 8x multiple, it is currently over 20x. Based on this alone it would be considered overvalued based on its financials, however one also needs to consider that higher multiples are typically paid for companies with stronger growth prospects...which leads us to growth.

From a growth perspective, Walmart is a market titan, the growth will be gradual over longer periods of time, but there are many factors that need to be considered from this perspective (as well as the others):

>\- Will their e-market investments pay off or will they lose market share due to more competitors in the business and pressure from Amazon?  
>  
>\- Will the decline of brick and mortar stores offset the earnings from the e-market?  
>  
>\- How much could they expand their margins by automating warehouses amoung other segments?  
>  
>\- Do their traditional brick and mortar stores provide Walmart a significant distribution advantage over Amazon? (80-90% of Americans within 15 miles of a Walmart mentioned above)  
>  
>\- How will Wamart continue to nurture their relationships with Google and Microsoft and will it continue to make smart and strategic acquisitions?  
>  
>\- How will future government policies and labor unions affect both Amazon and Walmart?

There are so many different unknowns that need to be considered.

# Closing Thoughts:

Walmart is an absolute titan of a company that is transitioning to have a significant e-market presence. Compared to Amazon, Walmart is currently the underdog that still needs to be very cognizant of it's other competitors, like Target. However, their recent partnerships and acquisitions have enabled the company to expand significantly online during the pandemic, and unlike Amazon, they have a wider physicals presence, stores that can act as distribution centers amoung other things.

Ultimately, Amazon is very likely to continue to dominate, however, Walmart does have the potential to start edging their way into the different market segments and start taking pieces of the pie for itself. Amazon is certainly aware of this, hence the reason it pushes timely wage-increases and other policies to undermine its competitors. Government policy is a significant factor to both due to their sheer size and presence.

t3_k2s3jm,What's the deal with CVS?,"I wanted to hear opinions on CVS. I've been eyeing investing in them for a long time. It looks like they're poised to do well.  Their dividend looks stable, not necessarily growing the last few years, from my research but still consistent and safe. Their balance sheet also seems healthy. But, it looks like over the last few years they've been beaten down. I am on the fence about buying them. Now that they've acquired Aetna, it looks like there is solid room for growth and opportunity, albeit with a risk of political factors that could hurt them.

For you dividend investors - - - 

1. Are you investing for dividends inside of a retirement account like a ROTH? If so, why?

2. Are you investing for dividends inside a taxable account and if so why?

I can see the reasons for both. Both accounts have many benefits but also drawback. In my opinion, I want to use my dividend income now instead of only having access to it at 59/60. . . I'm looking to be financially independent sooner than 59. Why would you put dividends inside a Roth and not be able to use those dividends while you are young?

t3_k4b6ic,STAG and Their Stagnant Dividend,"I encountered an opinion today I don't usually see. Stag Industrial's equity price has enjoyed a lovely increase over the years for an industrial REIT. Really pretty impressive for a company in their sub-sector. They do seem to check all the boxes for a lot of us: monthly dividend, industrial focus, trying to be e-commerce resistant *and/or* embrace e-commerce distribution centers. Apparently Ben Butcher is also respected as being very good at acquisitions. Yet, the dividend grows within a fraction of a fraction of a penny over years. Dividends are a policy decision... they do not necessarily reflect on a company's growth plan.

So, the company is growing fundamentals. FFO growth is steady. They issue shares accretively. The actual dividend paid shows nil growth. 

What are your bull cases on STAG? If they didn't pay monthly, would you still be invested? Do you approve of their policy of keeping dividend increases minimal? Do you think this will be a 60 (or 50, or 40) dollar stock in 5 to 7 years or grow their dividend in a meaningful way?

Edit: for what it's worth I'm bullish on the company and it is the one I am currently building a full position in. They recently offered another share offering with a price of around 30.40 a share based on the 8 million share offering with an additional 1.2 million shares to be potentially sold.

t3_k7au1c,Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) - A stock guide/review,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. This is the last stock review for the first poll that closed out last week. The current poll just closed and it looks like AT&T took it. So that will be next.

# Honeywell International:

# Financial History:

This next section will include information up to their 2019 yearly 10k. However, for 2020 (based on their quarterlies) they definitely haven't been doing terrible. The Space and Building segments are definitely down, however the Safety and Productions segment has helped buffer the loss during the market downturn. So the diversification into multiple industrial segments has definitely helped them. They have been doing so well over the last decade, in fact, [they were reintroduced to the DOW Jones](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-dow/salesforce-amgen-honeywell-to-join-dow-jones-industrial-idUSKBN25K2J9) in August. (They were previously removed in 2008).

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$36,529|$3,531|$6,896|2|
|2013|$39,055|$6,490|$7,441|1.1|
|2015|$38,581|$7,711|$6,113|0.85|
|2017|$40,534|$8,314|$13,924|1.7|
|2019\*\*\*|$36,709|$8,592|$13,191|1.5|

Looking here it would seem they have decreasing revenue between 2017-2019, however the decrease there is actually because they sold their Transportations Systems portion of the Aerospace segment into a standalone publicly-traded company (Garrett Motion Inc.), and also part of the Building Technologies to a public company (Residio Technologies Inc), so the decrease in revenue is attributed to those sales. ([Item 7 of the most recent 10K, page 17](https://investor.honeywell.com/Cache/IRCache/09f14eba-f828-c545-c341-6b1f333ff270.pdf)). So if we account for this then Honeywell has definitely been growing revenue over the decade. This can be seen in the earnings which have increased on average 11% YoY.

Debt has doubled, but considering the increase in earnings and revenue, and the low debt to begin with, it isn't too notable. The Debt/EBITDA ratio here is only about 1.5, so they are definitely not too leveraged. Note, the debt calculations above are short term + long term debt.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$2,830|$789 Million|$2,453|
|2015|$5,519|$1,073|$3,626|
|2019|$6,897|$838 Million|$5,880|

Cash flow lines up with with earnings, even accounting for the spin outs mentioned above. The CAPEX is pretty low, it does mean they are generating very good sums of money with the investments they are making, but Honeywell needs to ensure it is investing to maintain competitiveness. Free cash flow is very strong. Based on their sheets, in addition to the dividend, they are  using some of this to buy back some shares, 773 to 715 from 2011 to 2019.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

Honeywell is a Dividend Achiever that has paid and increased its dividend for 10 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$208.22|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|29.91|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$3.72|
|Yield|1.79% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|10.8%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.1%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|10%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|48.06%|

This will be broken this down from a dividend perspective, and then a value perspective. The dividend growth for the company has been fantastic, consistently at 10% over the entire decade that hasn't slowed down, plus the payout ratio is a low 48%. Based on their free cash flow this is quite sustainable moving into the future. The CEO has mentioned plans to shift the dividend growth to match growth in earnings (Averaged at \~5%), so this could potentially increase/decrease the growth rate based on those numbers.  From a value perspective however, the price of \~208$ is expensive, and some would say overvalued. Because of it's price, the yield is a low 1.79%. Based on the dividend alone the stock would have been more of a fair value when it was priced closer to 150/160$ (Yield \~2.4%). however there are some arguments against this.

Honeywell has been moving to a more subscription based service with its products, this model has a tendency sharply increase revenue for successful companies with worthwhile products and often causes them to trade at higher P/E and books ratios. In addition to this they are also partnering with Microsoft for cloud services. According to their CEO, Honeywell is aiming to become more of a controls company, using software across industries to control the flow of data. This move and partnerships support the higher price tag for the stock and helps explain why they are trading at a higher ratio, much like tech companies do.

# Closing Thoughts:

All in all, Honeywell is a well run company, they have strong financials, decent diversification, and competent leadership. Whether of not you feel the price is a good entry point depends on whether or not you believe the company should be trading at more a premium based on its financials, products, and future goals. Some would say the rally from \~$104 - $208 (March 2020 - Dec 2020) caps its short term potential and increases its downside.  That said, the company's aerospace segments look strong, and management has a clear pathway to growth through its digital and IoT initiatives.

If you're not sure but you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, pease supplement this with your own research. There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

I played with the full Dividend Champion - Challenger - Contender list for the last couple days. I'm a fairly ""young"" investor as I still have a bit of time in the market so most of my portfolio is situated around high growth stocks/ETFs but I will have a good chunk of SCHD & DGRW/DGRO for long term dividend growth. I figured I would see if there would be some good opportunities for myself but mainly for my father in law though. He's recently retired and has some money to put into a dividend portfolio.

**Starting Metrics** \- Anything that did NOT meet that standard I culled.

\- *3-6% Dividend Yield* (Most are fairly ""safe"" within this range and safe/long term dividend income was the goal).

\- I gave a little leeway for COVID so I culled anything that hadn't had a dividend ""increased"" since Sept 2019.

\- Looked for an increase in Dividend Growth when comparing 5yr&10yr dividend growth (%) - ""5yr/10yr Accel/Decel"" - I wanted this to be as close to 1.00 or higher. I gave a little leeway so set at 0.80 Ratio

\- Minimal 2-Billion Market Cap (sounded good and wanted legitimately large companies)

\- At least 4-Payouts / yr (Quarterly or Monthly Payers Only)

\- >/= 10% Stock Price Growth (5y Chart on Robinhood/Seeking Alpha) - Anything lower was culled.

&#x200B;

I ended up with a list of 31x Dividend Growth stocks that actually have some share appreciation. I color coded the stocks with 2x shades of green. The darker green shaded stocks actually have >30% share price appreciation over 5yrs. Then I started just going through each thing I knew how to somewhat interpret on the excel sheet and cull things at random. I looked for a minimal goal and then shaded that light green and darker green with things I felt were ""good""/""better"".I'd love to hear your thoughts on these 31x stocks. Interested to know if I am on my way to helping him out in a meaningful way and not misleading him. I also left a lot of the EPS and EPS growth and a ton of other things in there. I know some sectors you can evaluate them one way or another but with some they are going to be fairly different. I will say, looking at the PEG though, you can tell that we've had some record highs going on. A lot of those are priced pretty overvalued at the moment. Unfortunately I think that's just how it's going to stay going forward (with the exception of this December sell off that is most likely going to happen with the volatility of TSLA finally getting into the S&P 500 on the 21. Look out for some good deals within a few days after that!

t3_k7k8j2,AT&T (NYSE: T) - A stock Guide/Review - Poll winner - Long Post,"# Introduction:

Good morning/evening everyone. AT&T won over ABBV and PG in the latest poll. There is a lot to unpack with this stock and it is definitely more controversial, especially in regards to it's debt. Let's take a look at everything it does, the financials, and a quick look at its investments/acquisitions. The dividend and possible growth with also be discussed. 

# AT&T - American Telephone and Telegraph:

**Sector: Communication Services** 

AT&T is a diversified global leader in telecommunications, media and entertainment, and technology. It operates four segments: 

* AT&T Communications: 

>AT&T Communications serves +100 million with TV, mobile and broadband services. In addition, it provides internet to more than 3 million business customers.

* AT&T International:

>AT&T International provides TV and wireless services to consumers and businesses in over 11 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

* AT&T ad and analytics:

>Ad and analytics provides marketers with targeted, data-driven advertising focused around premium video content.

* Warner Media’s HBO & Turner and Warner Bros divisions:

>Warner Media’s HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. are leaders in creating content and operating the world’s largest TV and film studio.

**Strengths:**

>\- Acquisitions have added to AT&T’s economic moat,  increased revenues, increased ability to bundle services (synergies that enable cost cutting).   
>  
>\- Billions of dollars in capital expenditures and company investments (over 170 billion the last 5 years).   
>  
>\- The company merger with Time Warner will allow it to squeeze its way into the lucrative streaming market. Having one of the world’s largest content creators combined with AT&T’s services could be powerful. (This will be discussed further below)

**Risks:**

>\- Lots of debt. This company is quite leveraged. The Time-Warner merger increases AT&T’s debt to the point the company balance sheet should be watched intensely.   
>  
>\- AT&T is largely concentrated in the US right now.   
>  
>\- Intense competition from Verizon and other telecom giants. 

# Financial History:

Before diving into the financials AT&Ts goals need to be discussed. Recently they appointed a new president for the company, their stated goals include bringing down their overall debt, increasing their earnings and cash flow through the HBO and Warner acquisitions, remaining committed to the dividend, and the sale of underperforming assets to streamline capital investments. 

This first chart will break down their Revenue, Earnings, Debt, and Debt Ratio over the decade. The source of the information is the company 10K SEC filings. 

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Short + Long Term Debt|Debt / EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$126,723|$32,443|$65,573|2|
|2013|$128,752|$47,005|$75,293|1.5|
|2015|$146,801|$45,551|$129,613|2.8|
|2017|$160,546|$45,572|$165,665|3.6|
|2019|$181,190|$56,172|$191,680|2.9|

Revenue as increased 5% YoY, it is pretty solid, for a company this large that has been around for as long as it has double digit growth is definitely not expected. Earnings has increased \~9% YoY over the decade, outpacing the revenue, this is nice since it is increasing their margins. 

Debt has definitely grown at a significant pace, this is largely based off their acquisitions over the recent years. Back in 2015 they acquired Direct TV (gross), and in 2018 Time Warner + HBO. In both 2015 and 2017 you can see the spike in the debt to EBITDA levels above the 3x we would normally like to see, however AT&T has stated they are committed to reducing their debt levels, their stated objective is to bring debt/EDITDA below 2.5x. Already we can see at the end of 2019 that they have managed to bring the ratio down to 2.9, which is a good trend, something that, based on their quarterly earnings this year, they have been continuing. 

Let's take a closer look at the cash flow, and their debt payments.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|Debt Payment / Influx|

|2011|$34,743|$20,272|$14,833|\+362 Million|
|2013|$34,796|$21,228|$22,706|\+9,138 Billion|

|2018|$43,602|$21,251|$11,023|\-11,328 Billion|
|2019|$48,660|$19,635|$15,430|\-13,603 Billion|

Net cash flow is very strong and growing \~4% average. Their CAPEX line has been steady, but note that it does not include the cost of any mergers, acquisitions or purchases.

Now, the Free Cash Flow to Equity is looking really weird in 2015 and 2017, the reason there is such a spike in FCF/E is because those are the years AT&T loaded up on new debt, note the spike in Long Term Debt in the previous chart, the influx of cash from those loans is simply being added to the FCF/E here.  If they are subtracted the ratio more in line with the $15 Billion they have averaged. 

Lastly, the debt payments. After the acquisitions, we can see that in 2018 and 2019 they have been making substantial debt payments. Based on the recent quarterly earning they have continued to pay down the debt load.

So, thus far we have seen increasing revenues and earnings, strong free cash flow, and an increase in debt repayments. Good trends, yes the company is still leveraged, but not as leveraged as some other companies we have recently looked at (Looking at you IBM - they are currently approx 4x debt/EBITDA)

Anyways, let's now take a look at the acquisitions before discussing the dividend. 

# Direct TV:

AT&T acquired DirectTV in 2015 for \~$67 Billion dollars. Since then (and even before the acquisition), It has YoY decreasing profits as more and more people move away from traditional expensive cable in favor of streaming. Already they are looking to action off Direct TV, with optimistic guesses it'll likely sell for around $20B Billion. There is no doubt that this was an absolute failure and questionable decision, even in 2015, given the trends. This is one of the largest factors causing the former CEO Stephenson to be replaced. 

Selling Direct TV would allow AT&T to continue off-loading legacy, and capital intensive segments to boost free cash flow to focus on growth of more profitable (and not declining) company segments. It does come with a stinging loss of over $40 Billion just from the sale alone. The new CEO, Stankey, seems more than ready to just offload Direct TV, use the cash to invest back into the company, and move on. 

# Time Warner (Warner Media) and HBO: 

These acquisitions were incredibly expensive for AT&T, however, unlike Direct TV, they are becoming significantly more profitable. The profits for Warner Media in Dec 2019 was \~9.5Billion, these numbers are down for 2020, however much of the loss is attributed to the impacts COVID has had to the entertainment industry. Now, the introduction of HBO Max streaming was botched and delayed, this gave significant ground to Disney and Apple as they released their streaming services, however, HBO Max is reported to have \~38 Million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. Their stated goals are to have over 50 Million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 Billion by that time. 

In addition to this, Warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on HBO Max. This move is definitely putting AT&T on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from Netflix and Disney will be. Warner does still have agreements with AMC, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. This just highlights how significant the move into streaming by Disney and AT&T have been. Yes AT&T was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and Warner Media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable. 

There is a lot more to the Time Warner and HBO piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points. 

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

The AT&T is a dividend Aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$29.54|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|19.44|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.08|
|Yield|7.04% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|Current Payout Ratio (Based on Earnings)|58.26%|

The payout ratio may seem lower here, however, using the Cash flow from the chart above, in 2019 their total cash flow from operations was $48 Billion, minus the CAPEX of \~$20 Billion leaves around $28 Billion in free cash. According to their 2019 10K the amount paid out in dividend distributions was \~$14.8 Billion. So just about half of the free cash, leaving the rest to be paid towards short/long term debt, or whatever other financing activities.  

However, AT&T under their new leadership has several ways to go about increasing their margins here. Firstly, they could pay down debt to decrease future debt payments, this is one route they have mentioned they are committed to. Another is they could cut their dividend payment. The new CEO and management have stated they are committed to the dividend, however, this is a route that could be taken to further increase the cash flow for the company which could be used for more aggressive debt payments, and reinvestment back into the company to further stimulate growth and increase the profitability of their Media segment. 

Note though, AT&T has not been buying back shares at this time, in fact the number of outstanding shares has increased from 5,926 to 7,305. This does dilute the value of the stock, however, over the short term (especially if you are holding more long term), this isn't necessarily bad. You will see less price appreciation, but because they are paying out a dividend it will allow you to accumulate more shares through DRIP, so later on when the company can afford to buy back shares in addition to payout a dividend distribution you will see the benefits from the compounding effect of accumulating shares, and stock price appreciation. This ofcourse assumes that the company will move itself in a position to afford this. So the question you'd have to ask yourself here is whether or not you believe AT&T can manage their debt, whether their telecommunication services will remain relevant, and whether their Media services can turn more a profit. 

# Closing Thoughts:

This stock is definitely more controversial but hopefully this post helped highlight some key points. With the new CEO in management it will be interesting to see how AT&Ts current position changes. They have been trending towards completing their stated goals like bringing down debt, and investing into their media services. 

If you're not sure if you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, please supplement this with your own research. 

A quick disclosure, I do own AT&T stock, but that says nothing! Do your own research! There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

t3_k8hfpn,Preferred stock/baby bond dividends," 

I notice not too many people discuss the options of including preferred stock (dividends) or baby bonds (interest) in their investment portfolio, l would like to know what your thoughts are on this investment option to reduce your portfolio volatility/risk.

I want steady dividend/interest income with less volatility; especially when you get older or are saving for retirement.

Pros- more stability and less risk than common stock, dividend/coupon rate is locked in, normally higher dividends/interest, regular steady income, as long as you buy below PAR (normally $25), you're safe if stock/bonds are called/redeemed in the future. You 're paid first ahead of common stock investors

eg. ECCX- Eagle Point Credit baby bond, 6.6875% coupon, maturity date 4/30/2028, quarterly payments

Cons- no potential gains from unlimited upside of common stock in future, no voting rights

With the market at all time highs, an eventual correction will be coming, why not reduce the risk by diversifying your portfolio with this option, thoughts?",5,0.86,1607350833,"[['PAR', 1], ['L', 1]]",EFT,,

“Texas Pacific Land Trust Declares Special Dividend of $10.00 Per Share
Provides Update on Corporate Reorganization

November 23, 2020 04:20 PM Eastern Standard Time
DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE: TPL) (“the Trust”) announced today that its Trustees have declared a special cash dividend of $10.00 per sub-share certificate. The special cash dividend, which will be payable on December 17, 2020 to sub-shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 11, 2020, increases the Trust’s cumulative 2020 regular and special dividend offerings to $26.00 per share and represents $201.7 million returned to shareholders this year.

Additionally, the Trust today provided an update on its previously announced corporate reorganization efforts. On March 23, 2020, following a comprehensive review led by a Conversion Exploration Committee that included shareholder representation, the Trustees approved a plan to reorganize the Trust from its current structure to a corporation formed under Delaware law. On June 15, 2020, the Trust announced the name of the new corporation, Texas Pacific Land Corporation (“TPL Corp”), as well as the prospective members of its Board of Directors. A draft registration statement on Form 10 has also been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for review on a non-public basis.

t3_k89pl1,"CVS, WBA and now Amazon Entering the Ring- A speculative Analysis (NYSE: CVS, NYSE: WBA)","# Introduction:

Ohiogozaimasu everyone. I am back again for another speculation analysis. Obligatory warning: I am in the computer science space, This is just my take on the pharmacy field.

Sector: Healthcare (pharmaceuticals)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
WBA:
WBA owns Duane Reade and Walgreens with global outreach and beauty brands.

> -rapidly increasing total assets

> -Decreasing total equity

> -(Speculation) WBA seems to be going for accessing all medications rather than making deals with insurance like CVS is doing

WBA has been slimming down its costs for years. This is good for a rebound play. WBA has a historic yield between 2-3%. Due to covid, it has jumped to a 4% yield. WBA has also been committed to increasing the dividend payout.

CVS:

CVS is ranked 5th on the Fortune 500 list. CVS recently merged with Aetna. CVS has been aggressively partnering with insurance to drive growth. 

> -Revenue has been up year over year

> -Shifting operating expenses to benefits costs

> -Assets nearly doubled from last year

> -Aggressively growth oriented

> -(Speculation) From the pharmacists I have spoken with, CVS is willing to shift locations of pharmacists if they do not maintain a quota to maintain and raise profits at the expense of the workers

CVS has been rapidly shifting its views towards growth rather than dividend growth. They are just as committed to paying dividends as WBA, just not as focused on increasing their dividends right now.

## The Maths

WBA: 
Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBA/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WBA/balance-sheet?p=WBA) as of Nov 26 2020

Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVS/balance-sheet?p=CVS) as of Nov 26 2020

Stock                          |  WBA     | CVS
-----------------------------|-------- | --------
Stock price                  | $43.41 |  $74.50
Current Annual Payout/Share | $1.87 | $2.00 
Yield                       | 4.31%* |  2.68%
10 Yr Div Growth Rate       | 13.63% | 20.69%
3 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 6.88%  | 5.57%
1 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 3.06%  | 0%
Years Of Growth             | 43     | 0
Current Payout Ratio        | 38.79% | 26.91 %
Free Cash Flow / Share      |  4.69   |  9.63
Revenue                     | 139B  | 266B
Debt / Equity Ratio         |  .738  | 1.394

\* Historic yield of about 3%

WBA is the better bet for dividend appreciation. CVS seems better for growth and balance sheets. This can be seen as WBA dropped from 59.08 in December 2019 to 35.43 in September 2020, for a drop of 40%. This price hasn't recovered yet. Compare this to CVS of 73.57 in December 2019 to 57.32 in September 2020, for a drop of 23%. CVS clearly is less volatile. 

Potential payout based on 3 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary)

I will set back CVS a year to mimic its current behavior.

Year | WBA  | CVS
------|------------| ---------

2022 |  2.13    | 2.11
2023 |  2.28    | 2.23
2024 |  2.44    | 2.35

## Amazon Entering the Pharmaceutical Space
Amazon recently announced that they were entering the pharmaceutical space. I want to give my thoughts on this and why I think this news is being overhyped.

- Amazon is not entering the narcotic space. Pharmacies are still needed for that. As with flu shots. Getting this all in one place is still a “pharmacy” aspect that I do not think Amazon can mimic yet.
- Which leads to the pandemic aspect. I dont know many pharmacists willing to directly expose themselves to other people’s homes. Safely behind a veil at the counter or booth is one thing but open contact with another is up for debate to me. 
- Human and expert aspect: Human interaction cannot be understated to me. Yes it is faster with Amazon’s automation but having an actual source of blame or connection is understated to me. 
- Widened information spread- Everyone who has access to your Amazon account will have access to your order history and cart. Sure, it may just be for Ibuprofen or Hydrocortisone but this may still be something that you want to keep private.
- Multi Accounting to abuse the system. If a person has more than one amazon account, it is reasonable to assume that uniqueness of prescriptions may not be possible. After all, how do you distinguish between 2 pictures of prednisone (a corticosteroid, aka steroid) prescription? This can lead to easier overdoses. I am not certain that all doctors will accept Amazon, even for a while. Thus, “duplicating” prescriptions may become a problem.

That all being said, convenience, couponing with online sources like Honey, and gift cards are all aspects that Amazon has over pharmacies. To my knowledge, pharmacies are facing issues with people claiming to have not received their medication or that the designated recipient never received/delivered the medication is an ongoing issue. Amazon’s solution with signed and ID’d delivery can combat this. That being said, I still think people are underplaying the roles of pharmacies. If you need to get a narcotic or controlled substance at the pharmacy anyway, it is logical for me to assume that you would rather still have your prescriptions picked up at the pharmacy.

## Final Thoughts:

Both WBA and CVS will be titans for decades to come. WBA is stronger for dividend growth. CVS is better to me for its approach to growth. CVS did not drop as far as WBA did and CVS quickly returned to its pre-pandemic price. This shows stability to me. WBA can be a much better rebound play if one wishes.

SDIV: get some international exposire with this dividend ETF of tier 1 and 2 markets. 

STAG and ARCC: wild cards but provide an inverse play. If covid is extended STAG goes up due to it being in e-commerce. If covid goes away ARCC goes up due to it's sector position.

Finally for growth I put in VTI, SPY, PSI, ARKK, and VGT.

t3_kbhlyq,Comparison of O and QQQ in the latter's boom,"Here I've posted a simple backtest from 2015 to 2020 comparing the total return of O and the QQQ Nasdaq 100 trust. I was thinking of limiting the test prior to covid, say from 2015 to 2019, but I thought otherwise and will say why I've done so because I believe reality still supports the dividend stock on a time-frame from 2015 to 2020.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2015&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=0&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=true&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=QQQ&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=O&allocation1_1=100

If you look at the period from 2015 to 2019, O was neck and neck with the QQQ trust in terms of total return. This was a period when tech absolutely boomed and people thought commercial real estate was a boomer idea, so to speak. Had you invested in O in 2015 you would be about even with a trust that tracks the most promising of the profitable tech companies, megacap included. Neck and neck with the best of the best. Until this year. I understand backtests only say so much, but not everyone can invest the day they were born. It's worthwhile to compare a stock in a sector few cared about to a sector that attracted mass adoration in its boom time.

You only see the real deviation with covid, when commercial real estate share pricing dived due to market sentiment (and, yes, temporary but real commercial rent collection decline).

I have no bias against the Nasdaq 100. They're fine investments in my eye, provided you're selective.

But let us have a moment for people who bought what is likely a melt up and neglected one of the kindest entry points for a real estate company that can issue debt for free in years... and which performed as well as one of the most booming sectors this decade... despite being a boring old REIT.

The divergence in 2020 is clear. O's share price was brought down to Earth and I'd recommend QQQ as a fairly safe growth fund most of the time provided one continually invests. Should I focus only on growth in share price and a secular incline, I'd buy the trust and would sleep at night. Tech is great. I'm not knocking it. It's not 2000 for the most part.

I will say it's highly impressive O matched its returns even in a very recent period. If you think a crisis year caused a melt up in certain sectors due to a frothy and ignorant market which might turn down as froth is known to do... then other sectors are prime rib to one's teeth right now. 

And if you know of a company that can issue free debt* besides O right now, let me know, because I think investing in O is one of the most forward looking actions one can take as the year ends.

It is all about the entry point, sometimes.

*By free debt I mean issuing nearly a billion dollars in debt at less than even meager inflation expansion, some of which is due in the next decade. Real cost of capital is effectively 0 for Realty Income in an acquisition boom year for triple net real estate companies. I do understand individual companies shouldn't be compared to ETFs generally, but I make an exception here. O and QQQ are almost meme-like in my mind, yet I think one presents a stronger fundamental case than the other, especially in terms of debt and real growth patterns, ie, the things that matter.

t3_kcassi,"Dividend ""in kind"" / goods or services","Hey

It's just 2 years since I began investing in dividend stocks and I'm still learning. So I want to share something fun I just recently learned (for all the newbies and starters): Dividends don't just come in cash, they can be ""in kind"" i.e. goods or services. 

A pyjama producer in my country (switzerland) will give me a cash dividend PLUS a free pyjama every year, if I own 20 shares. (Calida; Caln.sw). A share is about 30 bucks. So 600 bucks will give me a 2.5% dividend (mostly stable in the past) plus a pyjama worth about  100 bucks (store price; very stable) p.a., resulting in a de facto dividend of 15% or more. 

Calidas finances look fine to me (even as I expect a recession because of covid); I love the thought of getting a free pyjama every year for the rest of my life for an investment of 600 bucks (or as long as the company exists).

Other companies may  

* give free coupons for on board (carnival cruises; ccl; 100 shares)
* give you a suitcase full of chocolate (Lindt & Sprüngli; LISP.SW; 1 share )
* give you a calendar (Novartis, NVS; 1 share needed)
* let you rent cars much cheaper / share owner sales discount (sixt; [six2.de](https://six2.de); 1 share ) 
* give you free entrance/rides Zoos/Railway companies: 
* ...
* (I'm excluding the companies that give you free food if you come to their assembly).

Positive: 

* Goods aren't taxable; so no deductions
* dividend de facto increased
* Fun

Negative:

* Maybe no dividend growth
* Owning more shares than just enough to get the item may not be worth it.

t3_kco79a,Lam Research - A speculative analysis (LRCX),"# Introduction:

Welcome back everyone. I am back again for another speculation analysis. 

Sector: Technology (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
Lam Research is a wafer fabrication supplier for the semiconductor industry. Now let me break down that sentence for the non-techie’s of the subreddit. Wafers are thin components for semiconductors. A semiconductor is a material that can mimic and flip between a conductor (let electricity pass) and an insulator (not allow electricity). They are made small and thin so as to minimize time between instructions. 

Strengths:
- Required for circuitry and technological advancements
- 5G on the rise- they will need wafers in mass production
- Very high growth ceiling
- WFH and corona was a boon to the business (mostly positive, precautions still in place)

Risks:
- Lots of competitors. Not certain if all are on the stock exchange but Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA (KLAC), Teradyne (TER), Entegris (ENTG), MKS Instruments (MKSI), and Brooks Automation (BRKS) are some decent ones to compare
-  This is a growth stock more than a dividend growth stock. They do grow the dividend but this is being evaluated more based on growth than dividend (to be ranted about later)
- Depth and complexity of chips will always increase. This is the flipside to growth. It has the balance sheet, and I am not worried. But as technology evolves, semiconductors need to evolve too. Like stronger NAND flash (usbs and SD cards) for a short example.
- China ban/embargo. Demand will remain but if the US is banned from exporting to China, it will need to be rerouted elsewhere. Immediate response is that they are in the application process as of Q3 earnings call, of getting the license to ship to China. As a positive, this shows their dedication to stick to their ethics and corporate compliance policies.


## Financial History and numbers

LRCX: 
Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LRCX/balance-sheet?p=LRCX) as of Dec 12 2020

Revenue                     | 3.3B
Debt / Equity Ratio         |  1.12

Lam Research has been paying a dividend since 2014 and has increased the dividend quite consistently. The payout ratio of 23% tells me that they have room to grow for a while. The downside is that the rate of increasing dividends is inconsistent but it does grow. But from a growth perspective, Lam is up 533% in 5 years, up 79% in 1 year. I don’t think this growth is anywhere close to done. I am uncertain as to why seeking alpha does not list years of growth but I will leave it empty due to that.

## Growth Potential Rant
One of my main realizations early on is that technology is ever evolving. In this day and age, it seems to be going exponentially rather than linearly. Circuitry is at the baseline of technology. 
Da Vinci Surgical Robot: A couple of months ago, you may have seen a video of the Da Vinci Surgical Systems robot allowing minimally invasive surgery. While this robot was not made by LRCX, it just shows the evolution of technology and how circuity is coming to other sectors. 
The rise of 5G: We’ve heard it all over. 5G is coming. Guess what, semiconductors will be involved. I think this may be the safer play rather than speculating on the communication sector, or the first company to release 5G. Instead of betting on those, why not speculate on safe suppliers of 5G components? Well what happens after 5G becomes mainstream? I don't think this is even close to the pinnacle. Years ago, LTE and 4G were phenomenal. Now 5G is the new buzz. Technology evolves. What will come in the future to make 5G obsolete? I’m near certain semiconductors will be involved.
Other electronics: As technology evolves and semiconductors are further optimized, I expect other electronics to adapt too. Motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, tablets, remote controlled toys, and so much more all benefit from semiconductor optimization. Faster command execution, cheaper products, smaller products. There is just so much room.
We are approaching the point where technology can do things that may not be needed. [Robo Dog](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). Point in case, we are optimizing robotic pets.
I really don't see the upper bound of semiconductor use. Technology will keep evolving so semiconductors will evolve with them.

## Final Thoughts:

I don't want to oversell my conviction but I think this sub-industry may be one of the Teslas of dividends. This stock is barely talked about, unlike disruptive stocks like SQ. This company has room to sprint, keep paying dividends, it's practically all we want out of a growth stock but pays a growing dividend too. When the biggest downside is the many competitors, and yet they are still rocketing, I think they are positioned well for the future. 

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research.

t3_kepnpm,Expat looking for a small income supplement through dividends,"I'm an expat in a rural area of Asia, cost of living is very low but so is monthly income. I make more than enough to live comfortably, about $1000 USD per month. Having said that, living comfortably can only be enjoyable for so long before you want to start making improvements and other changes. It's hard for foreigners to find employment opportunities around here, so looking for a better job isn't really an option at the moment.

t3_kfnsmd,The ULTIMATE Dividend Growth Starter Pack,"So I’ve seen a lot of people on this sub ask for recommendations, especially younger/newer investors who are just getting into the game.

I wanted to help these people out and assemble what I like to call the “Dividend Growth Starter Pack”

Here’s what it features:

1) Limited selection of stocks to avoid over-diversification and allow for more effective compounding

2) HIGH dividend growth rates

3) Low payout ratios 

4) Histories of FAT dividend growth

5) Currently undervalued

I’m also going to list several potential replacements/alternatives. I will list them in my personal order of preference but it’s up to you to choose one and only one and stick to it.

1) Industrials - $LHX (highest conviction pick) OR $LMT > $NOC

2) Financial - $AMP OR $TROW > $AFL OR $BLK

3) Consumer Staple - $TSN OR $HRL

4) Technology - $AVGO OR $TXN

5) Consumer Discretionary - $LOW OR $HD

6) Healthcare - $ABBV (my 2nd highest conviction pick) OR $BMY OR $MRK

7) Communication Services - $NXST (broadcasting station)

8) REITS - $HASI (renewable energy infrastructure REIT), $IIPR (cannabis REIT), $DLR (data storage REIT)

9) Materials - Avoid. This sector is far too cyclical and commodities price dependent to provide us the reliable dividend growth we seek. Might be worth having a gold miner in here as an inflationary hedge but I wouldn’t make it a big holding.

10) Energy/Utilities: $BEPC or $NEE (these are a bit overvalued rn)

Invest equally among the stocks you chose from the list above. 

Your portfolio with these stocks would look like this:

~2-3% starting yield (based on which stocks you choose)

~10-15% 5 year DGR

~30-40% payout ratio

~10-15 years consecutive dividend growth history

- 50% of holdings still below 52 week high despite growing revenues and earnings

- Conservative 6-8% annual dividend growth for next few years

Based on this, you should be able to reach a nice 5% yield on cost with some pretty safe companies that also have strong growth characteristics in the span of a few years.

For those with less of an appetite for risk I’ll assemble another list later with lower dividend growth but longer dividend growth histories.

t3_kgft5m,Investment opinion on The GEO Group - Private Prison stock with 14.2% dividend,"I have recently taken a large position (well for me) on The GEO Group. I will explain my reasoning and look forward to your opinion.

The GEO Group is a REIT that owns and operates Prisons primarily in the USA for State and Federal agencies.

Reward: They currently pay a 14.2% dividend. Prior to COVID, they paid a quarterly dividend of $0.48 which would result in a dividend of 20% dividend if it returns to that rate. My assumption is they will return to a quarterly dividend of $0.42 in 2 years.

Risks:

1. Biden has made a campaign promise to eliminate private prisons.

My thoughts:

* Many politicians make this promise but very hard to do because of GEO's political giving and a large number of jobs in key states.
* If Republicans hold on to the Senate it seems very unlikely. There is a 70% chance that the Republicans can hold on to the Senate according to the betting sites.

1. COVID law suites - There have been a few law suites but they are handling COVID pretty well.

My thesis, is prisons will remain private, perhaps 1 will be converted to the public for political reasons but that won't happen for 3 to 5 years. Several COVID lawsuits but it will be managed.

In 2 to 3 years 16% to 20% percent dividend and a 50% stock price increase. My model shows my $12,000 in stock will have a compound return to $39,000 in 10 years and then result in a yearly income of $2300 a year.

My downside is calculated at 1/2 my investment - $6,000

It's a high risk / high reward.

Please provide your thoughts/analysis.  The wife is asking me to clean up before friends come over, so I have to go now : )

t3_kh8nvy,Flowers Foods - A Speculative Analysis (NYSE: FLO),"# Introduction:

Welcome back everyone. I am back again for another speculation analysis. 

Sector: Consumer Staples (Packaged Food)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
Flowers Foods is a bakery focused company. They specialize in breads, buns, rolls, and other similar products. They cover the following brands: 
- Nature's Own
- Dave's Killer Bread
- Canyon Bakehouse
- Tastykake
- Mrs. Freshley's
- Wonder
- Sunbeam bread
- Merita
- Captain John Derst's
- Evangeline Maid
- European Bakers
- Butternut
- Mi Casa
- Bunny Bread
- Homepride

Strengths:
- Bread is a globally bought food and to me is a household staple like rice
- Committed to raising their dividend year after year (only drops were during stock splits)
- Covid increased Sales therefore will likely return to previous figures post Covid era at worst

Risks:
- High payout ratio (62.99%)
- Very boring stock
- Dividend growth is very slight year over year (right now it raises by 4 cents a year)


## Financial History and numbers

FLO: 
Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLO/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FLO/balance-sheet?p=FLO) as of Dec 19 2020

Debt / Equity Ratio         | 1.02
Debt / EBITDA            | 2.19

Flowers Foods has been paying a dividend since November 2011 and has increased the dividend quite consistently. The only time they drop the dividend is during a 3-for-2 stock split. The payout ratio of 63% tells me that they are pretty leveraged. The growth rate tells me that they are quite committed to continuing paying.They have an asset to liability ratio of about 3. This makes me think that the payout ratio may be due to branding deals.

Potential payout based on 3 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary). More realistically, they might continue the trend of raising by only 4 cents per year.

## Final Thoughts:
In our search to find companies that make the most dough, the boring ones are often overlooked. It becomes so ingrained in our searches for the optimal picks that we forget that some safety in our portfolio is all ryeght. I don't think people will loaf around when it comes to buying bread, so it will at least remain a household staple for years to come. I think FLO is set up to at yeast be a safe pick for years to come. The pandemic seems to have not phased them so I can safely say that FLO is at the very least on a roll. All right, I'm done making puns in the final thoughts, they're getting quite stale.

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research. And remember all, let’s get this bread.

I have just recently sold off a lot and completely restructured after starting to take my investing seriously, like within the last month so a lot is still working but I am currently set to be making about $95 a year in dividends and I would like to get that up to $1200 a year by the end of next year.

t3_kkox8v,Questions from a person that wants to start,Hi Im 20 years old and I wanna get into dividends to help myself financially in the future. Im just a little confused on a few things. I been lurking this subreddit and I have seen people say for investor around my age to invest in growth stocks. If im looking to invest for my future what should I be investing in? I heard that O and VOO are good ones. Also what brokerage should I use that has low taxes and fees? Thank you so much!,5,0.86,1609013229,"[['O', 1]]",EFT,,
t3_klaj2q,Young seasoned Trader breaking into the Investing world.,"So before I introduce my main question. Let me give you all a quick oversight of my current situation. I'm currently 21 years old finishing up my last year of obtaining my BS in Mathematics. I work as a operations supervisor for UPS which allows me to half roughly an extra $1k a month to put into savings ( after rent & other living expenses ) on top of the gains that come from my Derivatives account and Penny Stock account. Due to the hours I work I've always managed to be able to trade the markets. I have been trading Options and Penny Stocks since the age of 16 with my main strategy consisting of delta neutral trades. So when it comes to financial markets I have built up a great deal of knowledge ( within the speculative side ). So as I continue to read about advice for young investors the majority of responses consist of not focusing on dividends, but focusing on growth stock opportunities. Which makes perfectly good sense. That being said , most young investors I've noticed don't actively trade 2 other riskier/ quicker return % instruments that produce returns similar to what growth investing would. With all of that being said . In my current situation of having to accounts that are actively being traded with riskier higher returning instruments . Would it be more beneficial for me to focus on Dividends and not so much growth due to the high level of risk already associated with my other 2 accounts? The idea of creating a dividend portfolio for passive income to intrigue me a good bit , but at the same time I'm also after the wealth. Hence why I've traded pennies and options for so long. 

What are yall's opinions? Focus on Dividends with my Investment Portfolio since I'm obtaining growth from my other accounts, or still focus primarily on finding growth opportunities to invest in?Thank!",5,0.78,1609099996,"[['UPS', 1]]",EFT,,

t3_kmo5jc,MFA: yield on cost compounding question,"Hello,
During March I went crazy and bought a ton of stocks just because I felt like they would bounce back in a year or less... it was fairly successful. Currently I own 15 shares of MFA at a current cost of 1.01 it was .98cents before my first div drip. I am using an app to track my div and payout etc. 
When I look at my MFA horizon, what the balance will be in 20 years if I drip, the numbers add up in the UI but it seems out of this world to be true. Below is the image. It is saying in 20 years I will be making 7k a year on a 20k account balance. Is there some bad math going on? 
15 shares @1.01 current YOC 30%~ YOM 8%~
I understand that this would only be true if the company is around in 20 years and doesn’t cut the div. current payout is .075 cents .. preCovid is .20 cents current cost at $3.84 
What’s my over under on making 7k a year on a $15 investment in 20 years?

t3_kmlgfs,Brief Guide to Evaluating Bank Stocks,"Lots of people avoid investing in banks because they are hard to evaluate, their balance sheets can be opaque, and they are a heavily regulated industry. 

However, banks are also a core part of the economy, and many pay some nice, steady dividends.

The core business of a bank, taking in deposits and then lending them out at a higher rate to create “net interest margin” (NIM) is naturally profitable and that business model isn’t going anywhere.

Here's a broad overview to make choosing bank stocks a bit easier!

### Types of Banks

**Mega-Banks**: JPM, C, BAC, WFC, GS

With fingers in all sorts of investment pies, these huge banks offer many services – investment banking, wealth management, and loans (smaller part of their revenue than most). They may also have all sorts of crazy derivatives on the books, making their valuations difficult to judge, and in my opinion, riskier than people give credit for. 

JPM usually considered best managed, C or WFC if you like comeback stories.

**Custody Banks**: STT, BK

These two banks hold investment assets for institutional managers, hedge funds, etc and split this huge pie of assets roughly equally. An incredibly stable business model, but growth is modest. 

State Street (STT) runs famous ETFs such as SPY, while BNY Mellon (BK) owns Pershing, which serves RIAs and other investment advisors, a possible source of revenue growth. (I rarely see these custody banks discussed, and I think they're underrated)

**Regional US Banks**: USB, MTB (my two favorites, there are others as well).

Regional banks are moderately large and geographically diversified, but have less strict capital requirements that the mega-banks must uphold (bank regulation is a deep rabbit hole to jump down, much too big to cover here).

USBank is best-of-breed here in my opinion, with top-notch management, efficient operations, as well as a payments-processing business with a moat. There are other competitors in this space (FITB, KEY) which you can investigate to see if they appear to be a bargain relative to the excellence of USB.

**Canadian Banks**: RY, TD, BNS…

There are five (I think) dominant banks in Canada. They pay nice dividends. Many have wide international reach – Scotiabank (BNS) is deep in Latin America, for example – which is a differentiating feature among them. 

Living in the US I don’t want to hassle with Canadian tax withholding on my dividends, so I don’t own these, but otherwise they could be attractive.

**Community Banks**. For a nice list, see holdings of the ETF QABA.

These are interesting – micro-caps, typically with between 30-50 branches in a locality. Their success will largely depend on the region they operate in – think of them like a super-regional, mini-ETF because they survive and thrive by giving loans to local small businesses. 

Most of their revenue comes from loan spreads, so more interest rate sensitive – but they also are less heavily regulated, allowing for (sometimes) better profit margins than their larger cousins. 

Recently PPP gave a massive cash infusion to community banks, and while that program has ended, it’s been good for balance sheets.

Lots of due diligence needed, as the efficiency and operations of these vary bigly, and you’ll want to evaluate them closely before investing. 

My favorites: STXB (Houston-Texas, rapidly growing), NTB (Bahamas and Cayman Islands, good dividend). 

### Evaluating Bank Stocks – Important Ratios

The balance sheet for a bank is different from non-financial stocks, so ratios you may normally use can be useless or totally misleading. (Particularly, ROIC is meaningless).

Here are some that can be useful:

**Price/Book**: basically how expensive a bank’s stock is (more meaningful than P/E). P/B between 1-2 is normal, P/B < 1 usually means either problems on the balance sheet, or a bargain.

**ROE**: Return on Equity, obviously higher is better. How effectively a bank uses your investment dollar to generate profits. With interest rates being low, banks that have more tangential businesses (e.g. wealth management) do better on this metric than others.

A bank can show higher ROE if it is highly levered, has a lot of debt on the books, this is not desirable way to boost ROE…

**Dividend Payout Ratio**: how much of a bank’s earnings go out to pay dividends. If this is > 75%, concerning. Also check history of dividend increases in the past - some banks have dividend growth rates of ~10%, very attractive for long term dividend investors.

**Net Interest Margin**: how profitable the bank’s loan operations are, the spread between what they pay on deposits and what they charge on loans. A small bank might have NIM > 4, large banks might have closer to 2.5 as they are forced to compete more on rates. Higher NIM means their profits are more stable (arguably, it indicates a moat).

**Non Performing Assets**: the percentage of loans that are in trouble. An indicator of how good the bank is at underwriting for risks – if this figure is increasing over time, beware! Generally a well-run bank will have < 0.5% of non-performing loans when the economy is doing well. If > 1.0%, beware.

**Where do you find all these ratios?** I use Schwab for my brokerage, which gives access to **CFRA**’s quantitative reports – I think they do a good job on covering banks.

This is all the easily accessible stuff, if you want a deeper look into the balance sheet of a bank and so on, “The Bank Investor's Handbook” Nathan Tobik and Kenneth J. Yellen will walk you through that.

t3_km5j3p,Why I chose QYLD and similar ETFs and defied traditional FIRE investment norm,"I started seeing so many misinformed posts about QYLD and dividend investing in generals so this is my replies and my justifications for choosing QYLD and similar ETFs and hope it helps people who are on the fence looking for some directions on how to proceed. Don't really care about what naysayers were saying since I have been doing growth investing for a long time but only started to switch recently. 

The amount of misinformation and FUD spread on this subreddit could be daunting and I am still not sure why some people who are so against dividends are even here ? Maybe feeling insecure about their investment choices and need to shit on people on the other side of the fence to feel better about themselves ?

Here are the reasons I chose QYLD and other similar investment options:

* I care about cash flow rather than some growth magic. There was a period where SP 500 didn't grow at all from 2000 - 2013. Growth is speculative and those stocks are only worth as much as the next people who are willing to pay for it. The values are not realized until you sell. 
* Tax is a fact of life. Scared of tax ? May as well stop working, stop changing jobs to get pay raise, stop working hard to get promotion, bonus, etc... Tax gonna get you anyway, why bother ??? The point here is learn to live with tax. You can minimize it but not completely eliminate it. And I plan to move to income-tax free states in the future anyway so I will only pay federal income tax, not state income tax. 
* Some of the returns from covered call ETFs like QYLD or NUSI are classified as return-of-capital. It will reduce your cost basis but are tax-free until you sell your shares which I never plan to do
* QYLD utilizes a tax straddle strategy that makes it very efficient for tax vs. trading your own options. Read this up: [https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/Global-X-Covered-Call-ETF-Tax-Primer.pdf](https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/Global-X-Covered-Call-ETF-Tax-Primer.pdf) and be ready to be mind-blown. 
* QYLD and similar kinds like JEPI, NUSI are a good hedge against flat & down market. You need it as part of a balanced portfolio. Growth is not indefinitely, stocks will pull back. When it pulls back 30% what will you do ? Eating rice and bean rather than selling stocks at their bottom to meet your income need ? QYLD has been proven through multiple crashes to provide consistent income with consistent range that even some dividend etfs or companies couldn't do.
* The guy who invented 4% rule that FIRE people follow like Bible only studied for 30 years period and the guy apparently doesn't know what he's doing. He made recent comment about increasing the WR to 5% during the period where stocks are the most volatile in history and PE is to the moon. Lots of experienced fund managers have warned about a potential flat market in the next 10 years due to PE ratio right now in the unbelievable territory
* I do have growth vehicle: SCHD, VINIX (SP500), IHDG so I am not worried about growth. I only buy QYLD + JEPI + NUSI enough to meet my income need for FIRE then I start buying only growth or dividend growth etfs, no need to keep buying QYLD after I have sufficient income
* Financial security: you will never know when you lose your jobs, when you can't work anymore, etc.. Having focused on income etfs first and keep doing that till it meets your income needs will give you a mental safety net that you could have never imagined. Try switching your investment and have that 5k checks coming every month. You won't give a fuck about your work, your boss, COVID, etc... I guarantee it. 
* QYLD does have its driving force for growth. Selling ATM calls against NASDAQ will get you \~3% per month, QYLD gives you back 1% and the 2% the fund managers will use it to ensure the funds doesn't collapse. QYLD will match NASDAQ returns if NASDAQ only increase at most 2% a month but it will miss the rest of the growth minus 2% monthly if NASDAQ increases beyond 2% such as after a crash, which explains why QYLD recovers much slower. Hence, comparing QYLD vs. NASDAQ is like comparing Apple to Orange, same underlying investments but different return-generating strategy. QYLD recovers much slower in the event of a crash but you can be sure that it will never go to zero unless NASDAQ crashes more often than it grows (which is not possible). However, if you are worried about stagnant values, you can choose funds like JEPI and NUSI which writes out of the money cover calls for lesser income but it comes with some growth prospect. On top of that they are all actively managed so fund managers can intervene and close calls early to make sure you don't miss the growth opportunity.

So my final advice for fellow dividend investors and like-minded FIRE people is that do your own researches and make your own decisions. Lots of herd mentality here and make sure you choose whatever makes you comfortable with.",36,0.87,1609210687,"[['SP', 1]]",EFT,,
t3_km3lo8,The Power of High Dividend Growth Rates,"I know AT&T and dividend yield vs dividend growth get brought up a lot on here, but I think it's important to reiterate the following idea, especially for newer investors. Let's do a quick comparison between 2 stocks that have performed very differently over the past 10 years: AT&T (T) and Home Depot (HD). For this example we'll only look at dividends collected, not total return (although HD's total return was enormous due to stock performance). We'll compare from both a DRIP perspective and simply collecting the dividends to spend or reallocate elsewhere. All examples will use a $10,000 starting investment.

### Dividends paid out over 10 years **without** DRIP:

| Comparison      | HD       | T       |
|---------------------|----------|---------|
| Div/share 2011        | $0.94    | $1.73   |
| Div/share 2020        | $5.44    | $2.08   |
| Annual Payout 2011  | $337     | $588    |
| Annual Payout 2020  | $1,942   | $708    |
| Tot Div over 10 yrs | $8,863   | $6,497  |

### Dividends paid out over 10 years **with** DRIP:

| Comparison          | HD       | T       |
|---------------------|----------|---------|
| Div/share 2011        | $0.94    | $1.73   |
| Div/share 2020        | $5.44    | $2.08   |
| Annual Payout 2011  | $343     | $610    |
| Annual Payout 2020  | $2,414   | $1,194  |
| Tot Div over 10 yrs | $10,350  | $8,720  |

### Dividend Growth Rate Comparison

| Dividend Growth Rate | HD       | T      |
|----------------------|----------|---------|
| 10 Year CAGR    | 19.71%   | 2.21%  |
| 5 Year CAGR      | 23.68%   | 2.09%  |
| 3 Year CAGR      | 25.38%   | 2.04%  |

Note that HD's forward dividend was also increased to $6.00 and T's is still $2.08.

HD isn't the only stock highlighting the powerful effects of a high dividend growth rate. A quick glance without factoring in DRIP also shows Broadcom (AVGO) paying $16,616 over the past 10 years and AbbVie (ABBV) paying $6,876 over only 8 years. All of these companies (HD, AVGO, ABBV) have also beat the overall market in terms of growth during those times. In many cases these high dividend growth stocks will pay more than high yielders once you hold for long enough. 

This post is just an example of why its important to take all factors into consideration when investing. It's a good idea to determine if you want/need the dividend income now or later, as your choice can have a big impact on your future compounding. Someone retired/retiring soon may still opt for T since they don't have the time to wait for a stock like HD to catch up.

*All data taken from FastGraphs and Seeking Alpha*

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER EDIT: This post isn't saying to buy HD, its showing the contrast in performance between high and low dividend growth over a decade. Ideally you would want to find the next company(s) that will perform like HD, as a repeat of its performance wouldn't be very likely.",160,0.98,1609204157,"[['HD', 4], ['T', 4]]",EFT,,

t3_kn6u45,Realty Income $O - A stock guide/review,"# Introduction:

Good morning and Happy Holidays everyone. Thanks for the patience regarding this post, holidays have been a bit busy for us. For this review, I will be diving less in the financials since REITs are required to pay out 90% of it's income in the form of distributions, and since it is important to evaluate them based on their holdings rather than strict numbers. Especially when fluctuations in the Real Estate market are taken into consideration.

Please note, I will not be discussing individual holdings, there are way too many to evaluate there, however I am going to link the investor presentation and 10K below. If you do anything with this post, please make it that, check out those slides, they are loaded with very useful company information that would take way too long to discuss here. Plus they have better visuals. Because I am including those links this post will be shorter than my normal ones simple because there is too much information to include in a single post that is better represented in the information they already have.

# $O - Realty Income:

**Sector: Real Estate Investment Trust - REIT**

Realty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company, is an S&P 500 company dedicated to providing stockholders with dependable monthly income. The company is structured as a REIT, and its monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from over 6,500 real estate properties owned under long-term lease agreements with commercial tenants. To date, the company has declared 604 consecutive common stock monthly dividends throughout its 51-year operating history and increased the dividend 108 times since Realty Income's public listing in 1994 (NYSE: O). The company is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index..

**Strengths:**

>\- Very strong tangible assets. We will look a list of tenants below.  
>  
>\- Popularity amoung investors due to monthly payouts and increasing dividends. Dividends they managed to continuously increase through the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis.  
>  
>\- Conservative and responsible spending/expansion planning.  
>  
>\- Diversified tenants w/long leases.  
>  
>\- Occupancy has never been below \~95%  
>  
>\- 23 out of 24 years of earnings growth. (2008 was the one negative year, and only bt \~-2%)

**Negatives:**

>\- Dividends will be taxes at your ordinary income tax rate since they are non-qualified dividends.  
>  
>\- More susceptible to rising mortgage interest rates.  
>  
>\- Expensive compared to similar REITs. (due to popularity).  
>  
>\- Long term health/staying of traditional brick and mortar retail locations vs companies like Amazon.

**Top 20 Tenants:**

Many of $O's tenants are big names. As it stands, Realty Income has over \~600 tenants across 51 separate industries in both the United States and UK. Since 1990, it has grow from  630 properties to over 6,588 properties in 2020.

* Walgreens\* 5.8%
* 7-Eleven\* 4.9%
* Dollar General\* 4.4%
* FedEx\* 3.8%
* Dollar Tree / Family Dollar\* 3.3%
* LA Fitness 3.3%
* Regal Cinemas (Cineworld) 2.8%
* AMC Theatres 2.7%
* Sainsbury’s 2.6%
* Walmart / Sam’s Club\* 2.6%
* Life Time Fitness 2.5%
* Circle K (Couche-Tard)\* 1.8%
* BJ’s Wholesale Clubs 1.7%
* Treasury Wine Estates 1.6%
* CVS Pharmacy\* 1.6%
* Super America (Marathon)\*
* 1.6% Kroger\* 1.5%
* Home Depot\* 1.4%
* GPM Investments / Fas Mart 1.4%
* TBC Corporation\* 1.2%

So what was the impact of COVID-19? Surprisingly very small. Over 94% of Realty Income's tenants continued to pay their rents on time and in full. The 6% that were not able to continue paying include:

* 60% of Theaters (\*cough\* AMC)
* 18% of Health and Fitness Gyms
* 3% of General Merchandise Retailors
* 1% of Casual Dining Restaurants

# Dividend & Growth Highlights:

The numbers we will be looking at here are the dividend and company growth since 1994. Remember that these numbers are not indicative of future growth since they are backwards looking. No one has a crystal ball telling them how companies will grow in the future.

**Current Dividend Info:**

|Stock Price|$61.25|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|51.00 (They are popular)|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.81|
|Monthly Dividend Amount|$0.2340|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|4.7%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|4.3%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3%|

**Interesting Growth/Dividend Highlights since 1994:**

* Compound annual return of 15.3%
* Compound annual dividend growth of \~4.45%
* Dividend Growth of 212.5% (Including Dec 2020)
* Market Cap vs Debt = $21.3 Billion vs. $8.5 Billion

**What if you bought back in 2009?:**

Suppose you bought 1000 shares back in 2009 after the subprime crisis, what would you investment and income look like now? Well:

|1K Shares Bought on Dec 2009|$25,900|
|:-|:-|
|Investment Value as of Dec 2020|$61,250|
|Dividend Income in 2009|\~$1,700|
|Dividend Income in 2020|\~2,800 (Assuming DRIP)|
|Original Yield in 2009|\~6.5%|
|Yield as of 2020 (Assuming DRIP)|\~10.5%|
|Dividends Received from 2009 - 2020|\~$24,000 (Assuming DRIP)|

So, without even considering the stock price appreciation, dividends would have returned you nearly your entire original investment amount of $25K. Again, all these number do assume you were reinvesting the dividends to compound your growth.

# Link to the Investor and International Expansion Slides:

[REALTY INCOME INVESTOR PRESENTATIONS](https://www.realtyincome.com/investors/investor-presentation/default.aspx)

Here you can find slides that present the current company finance structure, outlook, levels of debt, and tenant information all visualized in a very good way. It is too much information to write about here so please take the time to check it out if you are more interested in those details. Much of this information starts on slide 31. Additionally the information can be found on page 34 of the annual 10K.

[REALTY INCOME 10K ANNUAL FILING](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000726728/d57a0155-979b-4fe7-a169-1a9306bf58e5.pdf)

Here in the 10K is all the detailed information about their ownings, ownings by state, individualized income from those holdings, mortgage debt, revolving debt numbers, total income and investments, and payout dispersals.

NOTE: Many of the numbers are can fluctuate wildly due to swings in the intrinsic value of their properties and the overall real estate market, this can make REITs a bit harder to evaluate strictly from a numbers perspective.

# A quick note about the 10K:

It is strongly encouraged you scroll through the 10K when you have time to relax and if you're interested in investing into the company. (Link right above in previous section)

At a glance on page 34, it can be noted that they have steadily been increasing their profit margins over the last 5 years. Yes Debt has increased, but so has the overall revenue, and at a slightly wider margin than debt expansion. This is part of their strategy moving forward and is discussed in the investor presentation on slide 35+ in the link above.

# Closing Thoughts:

Realty Income is popular is a REIT for a reason, it has excellent holdings, pays monthly, has strong staying power even during market down turns (2008 + COVID), and competent leadership with responsible, relevant, and more conservative investment strategies. (This is particularly important during downturns, see AMC vs Cinemark right now)

Again, please check out the 10K and Investor Slides above, there is much more useful information there that would simply take too long to cover here. This was a shorter post to simply get the brain juices churning before reading the information from the links.

Again, thanks for the patience for this post, thankyou for reason, please do your own research, and everyone have a fantastic rest of their holidays. Happy (soon to be) New Year!

Edit: I am highlighting this comment by u/methothimself for anyone looking into the 10k. REIT valuations are generally measured on a Price/FFO, Price/AFFO and Premium/Discount to NAV, which is why the P/E looks so distorted for most REITs as it accounts for a heavy depreciation line item. FFO adds back depreciation and AFFO adds back depreciation and recurring capex. On a P/AFFO basis O trades at ~17x on 2021 earnings.",150,0.98,1609350301,"[['O', 3], ['AMC', 2], ['K', 1], ['CVS', 1], ['GPM', 1], ['TBC', 1], ['BT-A.L', 1]]",EFT,,
t3_knz9k3,"Culled ""CCC"" List - Searching For High Consistent Dividend Growth Rate - 13x Interesting Finds For Long Term Dividend Portfolio (Sorting Criteria & Holdings Below)!!","I’m looking forward to the updated CCC Excel sheet coming out in the next few days but I was playing around with this month’s that was released on SeekingAlpha. 

I started deleting out things that met a few criteria to see if I could find some dividend growth gems.

What I went by to cull the list (Ended up with x13 potentially interesting investments long term investments)

&#x200B;

\- Dividend Yield (%) Range: 2.5-10% (2.5% is a healthy baseline and anything over 10% I would be extremely cautious)

&#x200B;

\- At least >5yrs of Dividends

&#x200B;

\- Annual Dividend Growth Rate (%): Typically a good metric would be a 2.5% Yield w/ an Annual DGR increase of 7% - Double your money within 10yrs on the dividends alone without any share appreciation. I wanted something better.

o 1yr DGR: >14%

o 3yr DGR: >14%

o 5yr DGR: >14%

&#x200B;

\- 3yr-over-5yr DGR Accel/Decel (Ratio): The spreadsheet is setup for a 5/10yr comparison, but I did not want to discount the 3yr DGR for companies that did not have a 10yr DGR. >1.000 represents an acceleration (increase) in the DGR over time. <1.000 represents a deceleration (decrease) in the DGR over time.

o 3yr/5yr Accel-Decel: >1.000 (Remove anything less than 1.000)

&#x200B;

\- Last Increase: Gave a little leniency on this

o x6 Quarters (>534 Days) Removed (Anything Past 1.5yrs

&#x200B;

\- Market Capital: >1 Billion

&#x200B;

\- 5yr Total Return (SeekingAlpha): >0.00% - Wanted at least some positive share appreciation. No negative share growth appreciation

&#x200B;

\- 3yr Total Return (SeekingAlpha): >0.00% - Wanted at least some positive share appreciation. No negative share growth appreciation

t3_knyyxw,"10,12,13 Get Rich With Dividends","Over the past three days I've read (upon recommendation on this sub's menu) Get Rich With Dividends.

Totally changed my perception of how to evaluate and target specific companies as 'perpetual dividend raisers'.  

Following my reading I started my research and targeted three factors:

4,7% yield stock and +
10% annual dividend growth
Payout ratio (using the cash flow) of >75%

To only find a handful... I am in Canada so I also looked on the TSX.  I am sorry to say but the choices are very narrow.  I really DON'T want to invest in BEN or MO... Then on the TSX you might have MFC, T or Emera that fits the criteria.  

What do you all do to find appropriate dividend stocks? You reduce the desired starting yield? You accept less than 10% annual dividend growth?

t3_knunfl,A question about whether to sell or hold for current dividend stocks.,"So over the last year I have started an investor account and have been steadily buying dividend stocks throughout. I started with some somewhat popular ones (T and KSS to name a couple).  Anyways as some of you may know KSS cut their dividend earlier this year but since I'm new and want to show some conviction for my choices I decided to hold long and probably still will but before I do I want more input. So while KSS dropped the dividend its been steadily rising in price with whispers of the div coming back sometime 1st-2nd quarter of 2021. I bought 18shares @17.70 back in March and now its currently trading @ 40ish. My question is is if I should sell for a profit considering I'm currently not receiving dividends for the stock and the amount of dividends id receive from a full year of owning it wouldn't even be close to as much as I'd make from selling right now?  I'm not sure if holding is always the best answer or if the profit outweighs the longevity of holding the stock in this situation? Please help (and yes I know to take answers with a grain of salt, but I need perspective)",5,1.0,1609437326,"[['KSS', 3]]",EFT,,
t3_knrwxd,Dividends for a baby.,"My sister and I have started a custodial account for my nephew to set him up for financial success and to teach him about investing at a young age.  He received a little bit of Christmas money and we are leaning towards purchasing 5-6 shares of T with that money.

Would there be any tax implications for a baby receiving dividends? 

Is this a smart move or is there better options out there?",7,1.0,1609428504,"[['T', 1]]",EFT,,
t3_knm6nm,Portfolio Advice,"Dividend team, good evening and happy new year! I hope everyone else is looking forward to increasing their passive income in 2021. 

To state this as concisely as possible, I am looking to increase my passive income. I do have a Roth IRA (mutual funds, actively managed, mostly growth, but some dividends) and also a 401k (target date fund) that I contribute the company match. 

Anything extra that I can afford to invest goes in to my dividend portfolio. This is not money that I will need for retirement as it is likely in addition to the two retirement accounts I will also receive a decent sized inheritance. I am not banking on it but it is likely. Due to my other investments and what I stated above I am a LITTLE bit on the riskier side with my dividend portfolio. In short, I would rather have less money now than have more money later for this account specifically... if that makes sense. Not investing for maximum return in the long run. I am investing for passive income now. I reinvest most of it but every once in a while plan to pull for trips or other fun parts of life. I do chase yield a little bit but I try to balance it out with dividend + growth stocks and dividend growth stocks. I have created a dividend portfolio that reaches across all 11 of the major sectors of the market. Most of the companies are blue chip and have a history of dividend growth. Most have high yield with a few low yield growers. A few pure growth stocks as well (hospitality companies I believe will rebound big time). Obviously this will all be taxed, but I am OK with that. And although pure growth stocks may be statistically more probable to perform at my age (27) I prefer the dividend approach for the passive income.

Below is the portfolio I have created. Please share honest feedback on things I’m missing or might want to change. I realize this is a lot of companies to keep tabs on. For me, this is “buy and hold forever”. I don’t plan to actively manage these positions. Once I buy I plan to keep it except for in rare circumstances. 

Currently I hold about 10 if these companies with about $30k invested and $2000 annual yield. I started investing in September. Wish I would have started way sooner. 

Thank you! Cheers!

Currently at a 3.11% yield sporting $62/year in returns. Nothing crazy but a start nonetheless!

Just looking for general feedback/advice at this point. I know AAPL isn't a great dividend stock at the moment; I was looking at it more of a growth stock for the time being.
